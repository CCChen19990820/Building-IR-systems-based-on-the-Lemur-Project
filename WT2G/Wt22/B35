<H2>Walk a &THORN;ne line, online  </H2>
<H4>E-cash needs security if the virtual market is to become reality, but
both governments and criminals want access</H4>
<H3></H3>
<I>By Andrew Clark </I><BR>
<BR>
It is potentially the most lucrative crime of all. Last summer a young computer
expert astonished leading Internet software provider Netscape by hacking
into the most secure part of its European software &shyp; its encryption
system. <BR>
<BR>
During his electronic break-in Damien Doligez, a 27-year-old French student,
cracked the complex algorithm that Netscape's browser program uses to hide
the email messages people send to each other, potentially allowing him to
access their credit card numbers. <BR>
<BR>
Damaging side-effects were limited as the hacker was merely intended to
disprove Netscape's claim that its system was unbreakable. But it was a
blow to the company, which is working with MasterCard to design a system
for encrypting transactions on the Internet. A rival partnership between
Microsoft and Visa is racing to design a more secure system. <BR>
<BR>
Netscape took the opportunity to lash out at America's electronic sentinel,
the National Security Agency (NSA), which historically regards encryption
software as a munition and severely restricts the export of sophisticated
versions from the US. It claims that, were overseas criminals to get hold
of domestic versions, the safety of US citizens could be compromised. <BR>
<BR>
The Internet's success has raised tough questions for governments and service
providers. The Net is the world's fastest-growing shopping street. Over
25,000 firms are selling goods to 30 million potential customers. But it
will fail without a secure means of payment. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Hideouts for virtual footpads </B><BR>
<BR>
Most online payments for goods and services are made by sending credit card
details through cyberspace. The numbers, however, can pass through up to
50 junctions at which criminals can &quot;overhear&quot; and record them.
Unsurprisingly, people are loath to risk having their card details stolen
every time they buy a loaf of bread at the online supermarket. <BR>
<BR>
These fears are bourne out by the high-profile activities of people like
Doligez. He is associated with a group of expert computer hackers called
The Cypherpunks, who boast that their mission is to &quot;break into other
people's computer systems, without their permission, for illicit gain or
simply for the pleasure of exercising our skill&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
These hackers, or cyberpunks, have vast quantities of information on illegal
practices such as code-breaking, telephone-tapping and charge-dodging, all
available to any browser who comes upon their home pages. An anonymous member,
writing on these pages, acknowledges his group's image problem: &quot;One
person's cyberpunk is another's everyday obnoxious teenager with some technical
skill thrown in... Many people look at self-designated cyberpunks in a negative
light.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
To stay ahead of these and other more sinister groups, a number of firms
are developing the idea of an electronic currency, both for everyday shopping
and the Internet. This would be bought and sold like any national currency,
rather than billed in the same way as credit card accounts. It could be
passed among individuals as cash but it would be stored in an electronic
chip. None of the systems are yet in full operation, partly due to government
objections. <BR>
<BR>
The view of the American authorities is clear. Encryption is fine, says
the NSA, as long as the government holds the key to all the codes. So the
agency developed Clipper, a chip designed to replace all other encryption
systems with a standard device accessible only by government federal agents.
<BR>
<BR>
Predictably &shyp; in the free thinking atmosphere of the Internet &shyp;
the idea generated a storm and created a highly unlikely opposition alliance
between right-wing Republicans, electronic anarchists and civil rights liberals.
The idea that the government could eavsdrop on the nation's private communications
scandalised libertarians and the idea has since been dropped. <BR>
<BR>
A number of countries, including France and the Netherlands, have already
made sophisticated encryption illegal. This poses a threat to firms like
Digicash, an electronic cash (e-cash) company based in Amsterdam, which
had to lobby hard to persuade the Dutch government to allow even limited
encryption on the Net. Spokesman Paul Dinnissen is sceptical about any threat
to national security: &quot;Our encryption is for authentication only. The
only message is a digital signature, confirming the origin of the cash.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
David Morton, a spokesman for the British company Mondex which is currently
testing an e-cash system, takes the middle view: &quot;There is a point
at which the police, government or security forces should be able to say
'We want a wire tap' and it would be inappropriate for them to come up against
indecipherable information.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Unique signatures for e-cash </B><BR>
<BR>
On its own, the digital signature at the heart of the e-cash system is of
no use to criminals as a new signature is created for every transaction:
deciphering a signature only allows impostors to disrupt one transaction.
But by decrypting and comparing many signatures the determined hacker could
potentially work out the formula used to generate them, raising the stakes
far beyond the implications of a stolen credit card number. <BR>
<BR>
Theoretically, hackers could then start their own banks, printing unlimited
sums of e-cash. One observer apocalyptically describes this possibility
as &quot;an economic Chernobyl&quot;. The criminal possibilities are endless
&shyp; tax evasion would be child's play, stolen money laundered at the
touch of a button and insider-dealing undetectable &shyp; because many e-cash
systems are designed to be anonymous. Greater security could benefit criminals
and neuter the police. <BR>
<BR>
There is so far no accepted regulation of e-cash. At the moment, operators
plan to issue cash only up to the value of deposits backing them, but this
could change. Any firm could start to issue e-cash, backed to a greater
or lesser degree by real money. It would not be far from there to the world's
first virtual run on a bank. Clifford Neuman of NetCheque, a US company
developing a digital form of the everyday chequebook, observes that the
only real criterion required is public confidence: &quot;Who do you trust
to issue money?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Visa and MasterCard are among those worried that if the industry remains
unregulated, governments will take action to restrict encryption. Such is
their concern that they have temporarily put aside their rivalry to form
a working party, hoping to set industry-wide guidelines. They plan to establish
guarantees on microchip security, the reliability of administrators and
regular replacement of codes and cards, pre-empting any legislation. <BR>
<BR>
At the moment, the e-cash market is crowded. Four or five companies are
competing to offer the primary currency system on the Net. The details vary
in each case but as NetCheque's Neuman says: &quot;It's like driving a car.
They all do the same thing &shyp; they get you where you want to go. Some
do it a little faster, some a little nicer, but basically they are all the
same.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Recognising these problems, some systems work <I>en clair</I> on the Net.
A US company, First Virtual Holdings, has developed a system whereby customers
get a personal security number for their credit card so that the card numbers
themselves never travel across the Internet. As a further backup, payment
is not due until after the goods have been delivered and First Virtual confirms
every transaction with the buyer. <BR>
<BR>
This approach is popular with seasoned Internet enthusiasts, who dislike
the commercialisation of the Net by large businesses. As it relies on goodwill,
First Virtual's system is better suited to the small-scale operations that
abound on the Net. The fastest-growing sector of online transactions at
the moment is not in cars, food or holidays but intellectual property. Internet
users are paying small charges to download everything from news to poetry
and weather forecasts. Schemes like those of First Virtual require the active
involvement of a third party in every transaction. If large volumes of commerce
are taking place on the Internet, the process gets awkward. Who wants the
bank to telephone every time you buy a bottle of wine from the virtual vintner?
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hackers and Big Macs </B><BR>
<BR>
E-cash will not be limited to the Net. Smart cards could soon replace coins
and banknotes in everyday life, if you believe Mondex. Swindon, in the west
of England, has been the setting for a trial cashless society. The company
has distributed cash cards to several thousand residents for use in local
shops. These contain cash which can be passed between private individuals
by using card readers, held by all participants. Explaining the choice of
location, PR spokesman Robin O'Kelly describes Swindon as &quot;a microcosm
of Britain&quot;, pointing out that it has &quot;a McDonalds, a Burger King
and all the other retailers you would expect&quot;. So far the city has
been blissfully free of hackers buying Big Macs in bulk and the company
has hailed the trial as a success. Mondex plans to go live in Britain with
electronic cash systems available in all towns as early as 1997. <BR>
<BR>
But if a cashless society ever takes off in the way that Mondex hopes, outstanding
questions about encryption will have to be resolved. If people want to code
all their communications, governments cannot stop them. Governments can
no more disinvent e-cash and encryption than they can disinvent nuclear
weapons. <BR>
<BR>
The virtual marketplace is still in its infancy. Although many argue that
the time when Mondex cards or Digicash chips replace the US dollar as the
world's most recognised currency is a long way off, it could be sooner than
many think. Computer experts claim that given the freedom they could design
unbreakable software, but for every e-cash expert there is a Damien Doligez.

<H3> RUSSIA </H3>


<H2> <B>Taming old Russian bears </B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>The watchdog of corporate
governance has been let loose in the bearpit of Russian companies. But like old
bears, Russian companies can be stubborn and bad tempered &#173; and they don't
like anyone getting in their way. Rupert Gordon-Walker reports </B> </H4> 

<P> On
paper Russia has almost the best corporate governance laws of any former
communist economy, but in practice the country's Wild West style of capitalism
lives on. The battle for control remains paramount and the laws are no match for
managers determined to hold sway over shareholders. Both foreign and domestic
investors have suffered losses after being outmanoeuvred by unscrupulous
managers.

<P> At the same time, shareholders have promised capital spending in return for
cheap equity only to renege on the deals. Analysts say the situation will not
improve until companies develop a capital thirst that can only be satisfied by
respecting shareholders' rights.

<P> "Control is everything," says Christopher Granville, head of research at
United City Bank. "Managers behave like owners now because that was how they
behaved and were expected to behave in Soviet times. It is important to have an
historical perspective."

<P> Legislation has so far failed to have any real impact on their conduct. A new
law on joint stock companies came into effect on January 1 and laid down
standards for company organization; the rights and obligations of shareholders,
directors and managers; and disclosure rules during takeovers.

<P> In particular, the law sets requirements for licensed independent registrars
which are precluded from other activities. This is to prevent conflicts of
interest if they engage in broking or provide custody services. It also reaffirms
the use of cumulative voting for elections to the board of directors. This erases
an anomaly in Russia's existing securities legislation, drafted at the start of
the decade, in which the principle of "one share, one vote" was replaced with
"one shareholder, one vote" by a young lawyer hoping to prevent the concentration
of power in companies. If Russian laws were effective, this piece of creative
drafting might have aborted capitalism right at the outset. But since they were
largely ignored, the freebooting model got off the ground.

<P> "Since then, people have blasted through all the charters, but it has taken
five years for the laws to be redrafted," says Peter Derby, president of
Moscow-based Dialog Bank.

<P> The new corporate governance framework is held in high esteem, the work of a
plethora of western consultants and top Russian lawyers. Whether it can be put
into practice is another matter. So far, the signs are not good. Although the
EBRD rates Russia's joint stock law second only to the Czech Republic's corporate
governance laws among transition economies, it places it at the bottom for
effectiveness.

<P> James Baillieu, director of corporate finance at CentreInvest, is also
sceptical. He says the law has not been properly put into practice because there
is no enforcement mechanism. The decrees for setting-up independent registrars
look good on paper, for example, but in reality they are often subsidiaries of
the companies whose registers they hold, says Baillieu.

<P> Even the establishment of a watchdog &#173; the Securities Commission (SC),
which gained legal status this spring &#173; has not prevented major abuses or
convinced financial players that doing things in a transparent way is worthwhile.
Last year, for example, there were two takeover attempts in the confectionary
sector. One, the purchase of Babayev, was done the old "Russian way" and was
successful. The other, Alliance-Menatep's bid for Red October, was conducted to
the satisfaction of the SC's resource secretariat director Dmitry Subbotin, but
failed. This shows the shortcomings of doing things the official way. "The
Russians are very creative financially, because in the past they had to be,"
comments Tim Frost, president of fund manager Pioneer First Voucher.

<P> Subbotin is not disheartened by such setbacks and promises more decrees and
documents governing market regulation, corporate finance and investment
management to come into effect this winter. "We cannot afford stagnation," he
says. "It is important to maintain the dynamics that will create a proper legal
framework and ensure the institutionalization of the commission."

<P> <B>Political battle</B>

<P> A tightening of Russia's criminal and administrative codes, which the
country's parliament, the Duma, is currently considering, should also help. But
even here the pervasive battle for corporate control in Russia has reared its
ugly head. Dmitry Vasiliev, chairman of the Federal Commission for the Securities
Market, who has lobbied hard for this legislation, has come out worse in a
political battle over the controversial loans-for-shares scheme. Vasiliev opposed
these transfers which were designed to put shares of major Russian companies in
the hands of banks. The former president of Uneximbank, a major beneficiary of
the scheme, was appointed first deputy prime minister for the economy in the
summer cabinet reshuffle. And, in what appears to be a case of tit-for-tat
politics, Vasiliev's chairmanship lost its cabinet status this month. He now
reports to the new first deputy prime minister for finance, Alexander Livshits.

<P> The problem of enforcement is compounded by the lack of precedent,
particularly for regional courts, and the lack of resources of the SC. But
whatever happens on the legal front and whatever funds are provided for bodies
like the SC, some observers believe the need for capital will be the real driver
of change in Russia.

<P> According to Subbotin the pressures are already building up. Two-thirds of
enterprises spoken to by the SC's resource secretariat  want to raise cash in the
Russian stock market or internationally.<B> </B>But the quid pro quo is exposure
to international accounting standards' audits and transparent share dealings
&#173; and only about 10% of enterprises are prepared to concede this.

<P> Corporate governance can evolve only if budget constraints are real, says
United City's Granville. "The struggle for control will then lead to a struggle
for survival" &#173; and in the heartlands, Granville thinks that only 50% of
enterprises in heavy industries, such as metallurgy, machine tools and chemicals,
will survive. In effect, corporate governance and restructuring will arrive
together.

<P> <B>Tyrant bosses</B>

<P> In the meantime, the abuses will continue. Many managers' first assault is
against employees who gained stock in the mass privatization programme. Their
usual approach is to siphon off profits into shell companies and then use the
cash to buy the employees' shares. This method is extremely effective because it
makes the companies look weak &#173; so employees are eager to sell &#173; and
reduces the wages and taxes that the companies must pay. "As well as paralyzing
government finances, there are humanitarian and social costs," says Pioneer's
Frost.

<P> The attitude of Russian managers to employee shareholders is that their
rights are diminished because they acquired their interests through a mass
privatization scheme and so have not injected capital into an enterprise.
Strangely, this view has found sympathy with American officials on a USAID
project working with the SC. "Why should a company's management treat
shareholders differently from anyone else when they have brought no money to the
table?" says one official.

<P> But this is not the case with western and domestic investors in Russian
companies who have also been on the receiving end of the Russian manager as
corporate godfather. Russian managers under siege have perfected the art of
sabotage such that it's difficult to tell whether there was a hidden agenda or
whether the company was simply inefficient.

<P> In August, Manezhnaya Ploshchad, which is building an underground shopping
mall near the Kremlin Square, announced that it would float 30% of its shares to
finance the rest of the mall's construction. The company, which is owned by the
Moscow city government, aimed to raise $35.4 million by offering 15 million
shares at Rb12,500 each ($2.37), preferably to a long-term foreign strategic
investor. A week later the share offering was postponed when Olma, the brokerage
handling the flotation, announced that a key company official was "out of town".
Was this really the case or had someone changed his mind about diluting control?

<P> In another instance, the Moscow city administration, headed by mayor Yury
Luzhkov, recently moved to end the long-running fight for control of truck
manufacturer Zik. In early 1995, Mikrodin (backed by Uneximbank) bought a 30%
controlling stake in Zik for just $5 million, but both management and workers
refused to accept them, and finally ousted them in January this year at a
shareholders' council meeting. After Mikrodin failed to regain control in April,
Uneximbank negotiated the sale of the majority holding to the Moscow government,
which was acceptable to managers and workers.

<P> Battles for control can also involve managers manipulating the very rules
that were designed to protect investors. A British company, Illingworth Morris,
bought a 49% stake in the Bolshevik Textile Factory, only for a Moscow court to
decide that it had failed to follow the correct procedure. United City Bank's
Granville thinks it likely that the Russian company's management manoeuvered
Illingworth Morris to breach the investment code, so the court had no choice in
its ruling.

<P> A report for the Securities Commission, prepared by professor Joseph Blasi of
Rutgers University, New Brunswick, gave a corporate governance rating to Russian
companies. Points were given for the percentage of outsiders on the board of
directors, the proportion of outside shareholders on the board, the use of
cumulative voting for board appointments and the employment of independent share
registrars. Points were deducted for dilutive stock buy-backs or new share issues
and for secret voting to elect directors. Half the companies rated "poor" and
none received the top rating. Even those rated "good" (39%) engaged in some bad
practices which would put off investors, said the report entitled Corporate
Ownership and Corporate Governance in the Russian Federation. The study concluded
that although outside ownership had increased since privatization, it had now
stalled while management ownership was continuing to rise.

<P> But sometimes it is the actions of shareholders that cause concern. In the
takeover of confectioner<B> </B>Babayev by Inkom-Capital (part of Inkombank), the
purchaser promised to make substantial investments. In return the State Property
Committee (GKI) allowed Inkom-Capital to acquire a cheap initial stake. But
instead of putting money in, the bank used its stake as a base to make further
purchases until it had gained control of the company.

<P> Similarly, Menatep Bank promised to invest $182 million in Ust Ilimsk &#173;
a timber company experiencing huge losses &#173; when it acquired a stake in an
investment tender earlier this year. The funds never arrived and instead a
classic shareholder-management bust-up ensued. At an extraordinary general
meeting in June, Menatep sacked the top management who retaliated a few weeks
later by refusing to recognize the bank's representatives as shareholders.

<P> GKI has had its frustrations with managers as well as shareholders. Chairman
Alexander Kazakov has explained that companies selling shares through investment
tenders are expected to sign an agreement with the GKI vowing to protect
shareholders' rights. These include putting tender winners in the share registers
and opening an account where all funds from the tender and cash from the
subsequent investment programme (if one materializes) must be kept.

<P> Russia has a long way to go before its standards of corporate governance meet
the requirements of Pioneer's Frost for, "clarity, certainty and consistency".
But as Jane Holt, deputy director of the World Bank mission in Moscow points out,
Russia's tradition of the corporate godfather will take a good while to break.
Investors will need to be both cautious and patient for some time to come.

<H3>A SUPPLEMENT TO EUROMONEY/JUNE 1996</H3> 
<H2>Sweden sails on to the world market </H2>
<H4><A HREF="#america">America discovers Sweden</A><BR>
<A HREF="#investor">What do you do with $1.5bn?</A></H4>

<H2><A NAME="america"></A>America discovers Sweden </H2>
<H4>US investors have uncovered the delights of large companies whose ownership
may be Swedish but whose business is international. Less well understood
are some world-beating resource-based companies. Nick Kochan reports </H4>
US pension funds, once the great absentees from the Swedish corporate scene,
have embraced the country's leading names. Their enthusiasm showed recently
when Scania became the first Swedish company to list on the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE). <BR>
<BR>
The Swedish presence on the American big board will increase when Astra
and Investor obtain listings later this year. Swedish companies currently
listed on Nasdaq, including Electrolux, SKF, Ericsson and Volvo, may also
go for the NYSE. &quot;The Americans are throwing as much money as they
can at Europe,&quot; says Mark Hawtin, an analyst at Enskilda Securities.
&quot;They will eagerly support all the new Swedish issues.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The growth of international interest in Swedish companies has been remarkable.
Five years ago, about 15% of Swedish shares were held outside the country.
Now, it's approaching 33%. In the biggest companies, the proportion can
top 50%. And as European ownership has declined, American ownership has
grown rapidly. <BR>
<BR>
Electronics company Ericsson illustrates the point. In March 1991, 21.7%
of its shares were in foreign hands. Two years later the figure had risen
to 33.7%; in June 1994 it was 43.8% and by January 1996 more than 51%. Of
these shareholders, 37% were from the US, 7% from the UK and 7% from other
countries. <BR>
<BR>
The impact on the economy has been dramatic. &quot;If you want to raise
money now as a major Nordic corporate, you cannot do it without the international
investor,&quot; says Hawtin. &quot;With total assets managed by the Swedish
fund management community of just $85 billion the international investor
has become very important to the development of the Nordic industrial community.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
But the love affair is conducted only with the largest and most internationally
diverse Swedish names. The rest, many excellent companies among them, are
largely untouched. For example, the P/E of Ericsson, one of the favoured
few, reached 21 last year as US investors snapped up a leading global technology
stock; but languishing in the doldrums are players like SKF, which trades
at 7.4 times estimated 1996 earnings or Atlas-Copco at 9.5 times. <BR>
<BR>
The enthusiasm for Sweden is more related to the positioning of a company's
markets than to the company's nationalality. Murray Davey, director of international
equities at Kleinwort Benson in London, says fund managers do not regard
Astra, Ericsson, ASEA and Pharmacia as particularly Swedish. &quot;Their
ownership may be Swedish but their businesses are not,&quot; says Davey.
&quot;Buying those companies is considered an investment in the specific
industries.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Svenska Handelsbanken's head of equities, Lars Gronstedt, emphasizes the
point: &quot;The main American interest is in Swedish blue chips with a
high percentage of sales outside the country.&quot; Ericsson, for example,
is favoured by US funds because the choice of quality, global, mobile telephony
companies is limited. <BR>
<BR>
Davey has watched the transformation of the four big Swedish companies from
successful regional enterprises into players on the global stage. &quot;All
those companies have turned themselves from medium-sized fish in a fairly
small pool of Europe into medium-to-large fish in the very large pools of
the world. That increases the prospect of their becoming large fish. On
the other hand the chances of them being swallowed have increased.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
ABB, says Davey, has enjoyed particular international success. &quot;It
has turned itself into a world leader. It's a big fish in its pond.&quot;
Astra's success, he says, is based on a relatively few products and its
structure does not match that of the world's largest pharmaceuticals companies.
He praises Ericsson for being &quot;at the very front of its technology&quot;
but he keeps his counsel on whether it will continue to run with the world-beaters
of high technology. <BR>
<BR>
Investor confidence in Swedish stocks is underpinned by a view that its
companies and markets are well-managed. Swedish accounting standards are
at least as arduous as US GAAP. The only blots are some archaic two-tier
share structures, the legacy of a paternalistic industrial structure: Ericsson's
&quot;A&quot; shares are a thousand times stronger in voting terms than
&quot;B&quot; shares, and Investor's &quot;A&quot; shares are 10 times stronger
than &quot;B&quot; shares. According to observers, the two-tier structure
does not concern foreign investors. &quot;Most shareholders are not here
for power, they're here to make money,&quot; says one. &quot;The &quot;A&quot;
shares are highly illiquid but even where takeovers have been mooted there
is no takeover premium in the price.&quot; Astra, for example, has occasionally
been the subject of speculation but the difference in the price between
the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; shares has been minimal. <BR>
<BR>
While the big names take the acclaim, Sweden has some first-class names
that are less well understood. Companies in the paper and pulp, transport
and engineering sectors such as Stora, SKF, Sandvik and AssiDom&auml;n are
world leaders, but in less glamorous sectors than electronics or pharmaceuticals.
They tend to be resource-based, and enjoy cheap raw materials and low energy
costs. Global investors rarely own more than 20% of their shares, according
to Tommy Erixon, head of research at Carnegie, the leading Scandinavian
brokerage house in London. <BR>
<BR>
Davey at Kleinwort Benson pinpoints a range of local companies, starting
with Volvo at the top end, which merit further examination. He targets banking,
medical technology and engineering sectors in particular. &quot;An investment
there is much more a combination of the company and the country. In a period
when interest rates are falling and people believe that budget deficits
are coming under control, and the general economic situation is improving,
those types of company benefit.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Erixon is a fan of resource-based companies. They are returning to favour
after a patch in the wilderness, he says. &quot;Interest started to ebb
last year but we are back on the rollercoaster. The Nordic markets are very
exposed to economic growth and have a tendency to outgrow everything else.
The cyclical stocks are one area where volume has been very important, so
when economic growth starts to rise, these companies benefit.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
These companies in particular continue to benefit from the Swedish krona's
30% devaluation in November 1992. Companies with a large local cost base
were able overnight to lower prices to increase market share while retaining
most of their profit margins. <BR>
<BR>
But investors shun some of the cyclical companies because they are still
closely held; investors can expect long waits, for example, before being
able to deal in Sandvik stock. <BR>
<BR>
Gronstedt believes foreign investors overlook Swedish forestry companies,
which are a favourite of local investors. But he says that such companies
have little need or interest in promoting themselves, at least at the moment.
&quot;These companies are well capitalized. They are in basic industries
and they are in mature and structured sectors so they are not likely to
come rushing to the market asking for more capital.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Doubts still arise about the state of the economy - in particular, issues
such as management of the budget deficit, bad debt left from a property
boom and the willingness of politicians to curb social impositions on companies.
However, in March prime minister Goran Persson appointed as finance minister
Erik Asbrink, a former central bank chairman, indicating that fiscal prudence
would be imposed. Persson has said he wants to cut the deficit to 3% of
GDP and to balance the books in 1997. Investors expect moves to curb companies'
social obligations to employees. Offsetting this obligation are some of
the lowest corporate taxes in the world. <BR>
<BR>
On the bullish side, companies have been allowed to build cash reserves
and keep financial gearing low. This has allowed considerable restructuring
of the economy and a number of privatizations. <BR>
<BR>
The outlook for corporate profits is uncertain. They reached record levels
last year but are likely to decline. Kleinwort Benson expects earnings to
fall by 7% this year (after a 37% rise in 1995) due to weaker demand in
Sweden's key European markets and a stronger krona. Ironically, overseas
investors are rather more confident about prospects for the economy than
locals. <BR>
<BR>
A shortage of smaller companies remains a problem. Erixon says: &quot;The
Social Democratic government is interested in creating an environment for
large companies to flourish, as that will help them keep unemployment low.
But when it comes to rising entrepreneurs, they don't back them.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A London-based analyst of Swedish small capitalized companies sees it differently.
&quot;In Sweden, there is a vast number of companies to look at and plenty
of good value.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The stock market, despite some local pessimism, has performed well since
the beginning of the year. The reasons include highly liquid balance sheets,
new legislation allowing share buy-backs, and an improved flow of liquidity
to the market. The overall market trades on a price-earnings multiple of
13. Though high by Swedish standards, this is modest by international reckonings.
<BR>
<BR>
The reputation of Sweden's derivatives market, called OM, has greatly assisted
liquidity on the exchange. OM performed as well in 1995 as it did the previous
year - a startling result given the rockiness of other derivatives markets.
<BR>
<BR>
In the past five years the Stockholm stock exchange has turned into an international
exchange using the latest technology. It made a further advance when recently
it was recognized by the UK treasury as an overseas investment exchange.
<BR>
<BR>
Sweden was also the first Scandinavian country to take advantage of the
European Union's newly-passed International Securities Directive. This allows
broking firms based in London, but without a seat in Stockholm, to trade
on the Stockholm stock exchange without going through a local broker. This
facility promises to generate further interest from brokers and investors
all over the world in Swedish listed shares. <bR><BR><BR>
<H2><A NAME="investor"></A>What do you do with $1.5bn? </H2>
<H4>It has sold half its holding in Scania, the world's most profitable
truck company. Now, Investor is looking for somewhere to put the proceeds
</H4>
Scania's initial public offering was snapped up by investors long before
the issue closed. On its first day the new stock traded at Skr183.5 ($27.14),
at the top of the expected range of Skr155 to Skr185. At this price, Scania
has a total capitalization<B> </B>of Skr36.7 billion. The sale, which raised
some Skr18.5 billion for Investor, Scania's parent, is one of the largest
IPOs ever launched. <BR>
<BR>
The reason for this great interest? Scania is the most profitable truck
company in the world and is enjoying record margins. It also offers investors
the only chance to buy into a purely truck-based company. Scania, until
now wholly owned by Investor, will be an important stock on the Stockholm
Stock Exchange: it represents roughly 3% of market capitalization. But 3%
of Swedish institutional money amounts to approximately Skr11 billion and
Swedish investors were allocated shares worth in total no more than Skr5.4
billion: if Swedish investors want to bring their Scania holdings in line
with its weighting, they will need to buy considerably more stock than was
available for the IPO. <BR>
<BR>
Investor sold about 50 million class A shares and 50 million class B, equal
to about half Scania's share capital. The parent offered between 35% and
45% of the stock within the Nordic area, between 25% and 30% in the US,
between 25% and 30% in the UK and between 8% and 12% elsewhere. A 20% stake
will be offered to Investor's own shareholders in the form of a three-year
option. <BR>
<BR>
The offering was priced at around 10.8 times earnings to benchmark Scania
in accordance with US auto- and truck-makers' multiples, even though US
manufacturers lost large sums when their businesses turned down. At earlier
lows, Scania's return on sales was about the same as American industry profits
at their peak. <BR>
<BR>
Investor's sale of half its holding in Scania raises the question: what
will they do with the cash? Peter Wallenberg, Investor chairman, now has
$1.5 billion in cash in his back pocket and takeovers seem to be on the
cards. But Wallenberg is an extremely cautious man. &quot;There are not
a lot of takeover candidates from within their own market but traditionally
companies that have been very domestic are cautious about investing abroad,&quot;
says Mark Hawtin of Enskilda Securities. He expects the company to expand
organically rather than acquire a foreign stand-alone business. <BR>
<BR>
He suggests that it might plough investment into the medical equipment company
Gambro. But it's a tough call: Investor is a holding company with investments
across Sweden. These include most of the country's finest: pharmaceuticals
company Astra, electronics giant Ericsson and appliances company Electrolux,
among others. The company's total net worth in the middle of February this
year was put at Skr54.6 billion and its operating income after depreciation
at Skr5.6 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Carnegie head of research Tommy Erixon expects Investor to diversify into
media, high technology and medical technology stocks in line with its recent
investments in TV4, WM Data and Gambro. As Wallenberg wrote in his 1995
annual review: &quot;The introduction of Scania on the stock exchange will
provide an excellent foundation for continued expansion...Identifying companies
in future-oriented industries and investing in them will serve as an important
complement to the current holdings.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Investor has placed some of Sweden's leading investment analysts in Singapore,
Hong Kong and London, to scout out new directions. Each location has specific
target areas: London handles investment in telecommunications, information
technology, aviation, the service sector and the media; New York covers
pharmaceuticals, medical technology, banking and insurance; Stockholm follows
engineering and automotive industries, and forest and consumer products;
and Hong Kong monitors Asian markets. The company said in 1995 that it intended
to build up this new portfolio &quot;gradually&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Although Investor is highly regarded it has its critics. &quot;They have
been living extremely well off the devaluations and the business cycle,&quot;
says one analyst. &quot;Those events won't happen again. They need to diversify
into growth areas.&quot; Other critics say Investor has been so successful
because of its pharmaceuticals company Astra. <BR>
<BR>
There is one large question mark that hangs over Investor's strategy. Peter
Wallenberg is preparing to retire as his own son and late brother's son
take over parts of the empire. The success of the new generation will have
profound consequences not just for Investor but for the entire Swedish economy.

<H2>Change, a foreign idea </H2>
<H4>If a company ever reached the dire condition of western foreign policy
institutions, it would face bankruptcy </H4>
<B>by Daniel Plesch, director of British-American Security Information Council
(Basic), an independent non-profit research body </B><BR>
<BR>
Whenever anyone points out that western foreign policy is in a mess, the
criticism is stopped in its tracks by excuses about the challenge of rapid
change and the need for time to find a new way after the end of the Cold
War. If any international corporation had reached the same state, however,
it would have met either bankruptcy or serious re-engineering, a radical
re-thinking of operational strategy and personnel. <BR>
<BR>
Such restructuring is long overdue in foreign policy institutions, which
have not seen the qualitative changes that have swept through the corporate
world and other areas of life, beyond a superficial reorganisation of departments
and greater use of information technology. And models for change are already
at hand not only in industry but among so-called non-governmental organisations
(ngos), the creative misfits and wonks of the foreign policy world whose
skills and insights should be harnessed just as they have in other fields.
<BR>
<BR>
First, have those institutions failed to perform? The widespread perception
is &quot;yes&quot;, although different groups will give different reasons:
just four years after the collapse of the only significant competitor, the
former Soviet Union, all the major western and international security institutions
- Nato, the eu, Western European Union, Organisation for Security and
Cooperation in Europe and the un - face crises of legitimacy and effectiveness.
Continued fighting in the Balkans is only the most obvious example, where
a lack of political will on the part of these institutions and the major
powers that lead them has led to deep disillusionment. <BR>
<BR>
Failures to prevent and resolve new wars are commonly attributed to the
complexity of the problem at hand and the deep-rooted ethnic hatreds at
stake: the statesmen are doing what they can but the problem lies in the
barbarous peoples involved. In business, if the chief executive blamed poor
results on the customers, retail outlets and directors, confidence in the
company would plummet along with the share price. <BR>
<BR>
Like western foreign policy establishments, some floundering corporate giants
were strong enough to withstand structural ineffectiveness without collapsing.
In the '70s the us car manufacturers of Detroit survived despite an inability
to produce reliable compact cars. Such corporate cultures marginalised individuals
with the ideas capable of producing renewal while a host of rationalisations
were found for continuing as before. But they suffered for this as the increasingly
rapid change of market conditions made old conventions less and less acceptable.
<BR>
<BR>
In foreign policy the same principles should have been applied, but this
has not happened. Instead, the incremental nature of policy changes and
security relationships look like the doomed attempt of corporate dinosaurs
to make their mainframes run faster and their gas guzzlers better-tuned.
Foreign ministries trained in 18th or 19th century diplomacy have taken
few steps towards wholehearted modernisation. <BR>
<BR>
The comparison with business may seem an outrageous one: after all, foreign
affairs are not the same as video production. It may also be unfair to compare
a varied panoply of institutions and governments to the more simple structure
and goals of a single private business entity. But overall, the same fundamental
psychological inflexibility lies at the heart of the problems facing the
failing foreign affairs conglomerates of Washington, New York and Brussels.
Practical, alternate approaches are ignored and the stultified rigid structures
play for more time to make the necessary changes. <BR>
<BR>
The risk of loose nukes in the former Soviet Union is one example. The industrial
infrastructure which has produced some 60,000 nuclear weapons is now decaying
in every respect, threatening accidental releases of radioactive material
into the atmosphere, a brain drain to potential proliferators such as Iran
or Libya and even the transfer of nuclear weapons themselves. Academics
and experts from ngos have presented a variety of schemes to improve safeguards
and security which all have strong support among Russian officials and western
public opinion. But in the us and Europe, defence and foreign ministries
have given little support to these projects. <BR>
<BR>
Another is the arms trade. Although accounting for a relatively small part
of world trade, weapons transfers can have a profound and damaging effect
on economic development when they come to be used. A rational choice would
be to start phasing out the arms trade, beginning with a moratorium on transfers.
To do so would require taking on strong vested interests in the few supplier
states such as the us, which has some 70% of the market. The lack of any
such control is perhaps the single most obvious example of the harmful grip
of special interests on foreign affairs. <BR>
<BR>
The Balkans conflict provides further sad examples. While western national
security intelligentsia opine about centuries-old ethnic hatreds and badly
briefed peace negotiators apply all-purpose mediation techniques, warlords
on the ground conduct sophisticated television propaganda campaigns which
whip up and sustain the conflict. There has been no external attempt to
launch a counter-propaganda effort, for example to use a un television station
to explain its policies to people in the region, even less to prepare a
fully pluralistic television broadcasting system using the wealth of anti-war
talent in the region, as recommended by the un's special rapporteur three
years ago. The international community has also negotiated with local warlords
to the exclusion of Bosnian Serb organisations opposed to the war. <BR>
<BR>
And what are we to make of the constant demand for &quot;more time&quot;
to adjust to a troublesome post-Cold War world? Why is it seen, not as an
opportunity to be grasped with enthusiasm, but as a weary task calling for
what George Bush's aides dubbed the &quot;status quo plus&quot;? A typical
example of the language used by the foreign policy establishment is found
in the leaflet for a new security institute bringing together top European
military officers, diplomats, industrial leaders and academics. The institute
states: &quot;We are forced to acknowledge that we are in a varied and changing
world.&quot; The emphasis here is on the word &quot;forced&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Reading Nato's <I>communiqu&eacute;s </I>since 1990, we find the oft-repeated
message that the alliance has changed a great deal and needs further patience.
It is true that complicated changes are under consideration and Nato cannot
be held solely responsible for foreign policy failures, especially the lack
of political decisiveness in the Balkans where the forces on offer have
often failed to be deployed. But it is clearly flailing about in its effort
to find a new leadership role and its dog-in-the-manger approach is preventing
anyone else from filling the gap in its place. <BR>
<BR>
In the case of the collapse of former Yugoslavia, the potential problem
had been anticipated for years: indeed, during the Cold War its disintegration
following the death of its long-standing Communist leader Josef Broz Tito
was one of the main scenarios used by Nato spokesmen in elaborating their
strategy. Since then, they have been understandably distracted by worries
about the collapse of the Soviet Union. With the collapse of the Cold War
value system only the Vatican retained its vigour in promoting the Catholic
Croats. The leading European states found themselves acting out a return
to 19th century spheres-of-influence politics, with Germany lining up against
Britain and France, rather than promoting a policy which would enhance the
values that supposedly built the eu. <BR>
<BR>
Was this because they really had vital and competing interests in the Balkans?
The more likely explanation is that, with the model of a lifetime no longer
relevant and no new model conceivable, the only reference point was what
was done before. We have returned to sphere-of-influence politics because
it is the only way the foreign policy establishments know how to behave.
<BR>
<BR>
It is all so unnecessary, because the components for a modern policy formulation
are all at hand. Non-governmental aid, environmental and arms- control organisations
have developed a critical and creative culture from which new organisational
methods, analyses and staff may be drawn and put to work in governmental
operations, along with the creative pockets extant within the bureaucracies
themselves. <BR>
<BR>
Oxfam and other agencies have worked with firms in the developing world
to swop debt for aid, so creating a partnership rather than a colonial relationship.
The Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement, albeit shaky, came about through
informal backchannels rather than the formal process. <BR>
<BR>
Governments have been unwilling to adopt or even debate the alternatives,
however, largely because of short-term costs and an unwillingness to accept
that sins of omission - the risk of doing nothing - could be as
great or greater than those of commission. <BR>
<BR>
The foreign policy establishment is likely to argue that its subject matter
is too sensitive and the rigours of <I>realpolitik </I>too strong for such
alternative do-gooders, and there are times when they might be right. Nevertheless,
the central guiding concept for the 21st century should be a recognition
that, just as in other sectors of life, we need to create new foreign policy
instruments drawn from contemporary culture and give less reliance to old
rigid instruments which have outlived their usefulness. <p>

<H3>THE MOORGATE SAGA </H3>

<ALIGN="LEFT">
<H2>Let them drink champagne</H2>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<B>H&ocirc;tel du Front Populaire (ci-devant Crillon), 10 Place de la R&eacute;volution (ci-devant Concorde), 75008 Paris, France</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I am cowering under the table by the bar with my glass of champagne when the guy under the next table downs his and heads for the door, anxious hands stretch out to drag him back to safety but he cries: No, No, the mob is in the street and I must see which way they are going, for I am their leader.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mom, I recognize the type, there are guys like him in every market and some of them survive, at that, but such scenes are not what I look for when I come to Paris, France, for lunch. It just goes to show that there is no such thing as a free ride, another fine mess Alastair Morton gets me into.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>H</B>e is the guy who digs a tunnel from England to France and invites banks all around the world to pour their money down it, which we do. The guy is most persuasive: Cough up, he says, or I smash your face in, but by now the debt mounts up and the interest dries up and some of the Japanese talk of foreclosing until he asks them what they plan to do with the world's longest submarine mushroom farm.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Me, I am easily persuaded, especially by Alastair, when he offers me what he says is a temporary reconstruction, for the rest of the century we agree to waive interest payments in favor of passes to ride, so I arrange a trial trip, out on the red eye express, a pitch for a privatization, refuel at the Terminus Brasserie and then stroll across the road and sleep all the way to the other end, which to put the French down is called Waterloo.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Well, we go bowling thru Alastair's tunnel and roll in to Paris on time, and if I am a smidgen late for old Pons at the Ministry of Transport, it is because the streets are blocked and my taxi is diverted round some bonfires, with a lot of guys milling around them keeping warm.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We talk about placing French railroad stock with mid-western investors, his plan is to fire all the staff and close all the lines, or most of them, and what is left is a marketable commodity and a cinch for the next clearance sale. Herbie, he says, I wish you a bon voyage to Waterloo, but not today, I just hear the strike spreads and no trains now operate, for some reason the cheminots are protesting my plan.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is more bad news for Alastair but I plan to hack out to the airport and travel the old fashioned way, until Pons goes on to wish me luck, or chance. It seems his air traffic controllers decide the holiday weekends come early, and farmers send protesting cows to occupy the runways, and the Air France crews come out in sympathy with the cheminots and with themselves. It seems they are due for the slash and burn treatment in good time for privatization.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The most he can do for me is to direct me to the river, where some boats are still running. I hope to find one that takes me as far as Canary Wharf and from there I can make my way to London by myself, but all I get from the captain is a mouthful of abuse and halitosis, from which I figure I am stranded, in which case I need to be stranded in comfort.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I wind up at this neat little old hotel plumb next to the US embassy and put a call thru to Moorgate, where I do not get the sympathy I figure I deserve, or the credibility either. Poor you, our girl just says, all on your own at the Crillon, tut tut, I do hope you can make some useful contacts.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At that I try, starting with the Banque de France. I plan to look in on Jean Claude and have a word with him about this notion that the franc is just a D-mark with a classier accent, or maybe an ost-mark, so they trade one for one into a monopoly currency for Europe, and I hear the latest guys to threaten all out strikes are the Amalgamated Brotherhood of Foreign Exchange Dealers.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But when I call his office all I get is a recorded announcement, kinda terse and clipped, I decode it with my phrase book and it seems to mean the central bank is out on strike. Mom, I never figure such a thing is possible, next we see Alan Greenspan on a picket line, but if slash and burn tactics get this far it may explain why so many more guys now seem to be out on the streets slashing and burning.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Then luckily I bump into a guy from the embassy who looks in on the hotel bar for a quick factfinder, he explains to me how this monopoly currency idea is where the trouble starts. If France is to meet the timetable for the merger, its economy needs to converge, which for openers means not having all these guys hanging around on the public payroll or on early pensions. If you think France has unemployment now, you ain't seen nothing yet.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So I ask what our policy is about this and he says it is for the Europeans to get their act together for once in a while and not just rely on Uncle Sam and his marines to do the work for them. So we like it when they make an effort but we wish they do not hit on this one, after all, if a single market needs a single currency we merge the Canadian dollar with the peso.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>B</B>y this time, the noise outside is getting louder, with thumps and bangs and yells of <I>A bas le franc</I> and <I>Emu &agrave; la lanterne</I>, and cobblestones start coming thru the window till the barman puts the shutters up. I am listening for the sirens of the riot police and the sharp crack of nightsticks on skulls, but I figure the police are in the public sector, so they may be on strike.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I have just time to call out to the mob leader. I tell him to call for a quick realignment at a quiet weekend, such as the French are so good at in the old days, wrongfooting everyone. He says it is not much of a slogan but he does his best.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Maybe this is how the story ends but I cannot wait to find out, I accept the embassy guy's invitation to have us evacuated by helicopter from the roof, but not (he says) until we finish the champagne, much love from
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Your beleaguered son

<b>Edited by Steven Irvine </B>
<H2>International bonding in Cannes... </H2>
The International Securities Market Association returned to the South of
France for its 28th annual meeting this year. Those who had been at the
legendary two-day bash in Nice 12 years ago, where antique chairs were thrown
through unopened windows at one member firm's twelfth floor party, expected
great things from Cannes. <BR>
<BR>
Isma veterans reflected that this meeting was not quite so riotous, although
it didn't lack its touches of excess. At the welcome beach party, bond traders
and other delegates were ushered through floral bridges held by local peasants.
<BR>
<BR>
This was immediately followed by the Euroclear party which provided the
highlight of the conference: two glass cubicles raised 20 metres above the
Hilton's foyer. Inside them, two robotic mermaids dancing with hairdryers
blowing their long tresses. <BR>
<BR>
The robots proved to be topless, and soon one of them broke into giggles,
betraying the fact that she was a lowly human. One broker instantly made
a beeline for the stairs, determined to check out these heavenly creatures
by entering one of the cubicles. Fast-thinking security intervened. <BR>
<BR>
The meeting began in earnest next morning in the auditorium of the Palais
des Festivals. An experienced delegate advised a younger colleague: &quot;Don't
sit at the back. The latecomers wake you up at the end when they come in.&quot;
One Swiss trader never arrived, after spending an hour and a quarter trying
to find the auditorium. Apparently no one could tell him where it was. <BR>
<BR>
Records show that 463 members were present - 58% of the total membership.
Over 79% had hangovers. There were 81 member firm resignations. <BR>
<BR>
In the course of two and a bit hours not a single delegate asked a question,
even when invited to do so. Isma's flagging membership was noted, although
chairman, Rijnhard van Tets did his best to reverse the trend. According
to the participation list, his bank, ABN Amro, brought 17 delegates, nearly
twice as many as any other institution. <BR>
<BR>
Most puzzling was the board's decision to suppress the perception report
it had commissioned last year. The so-called Ludgate report was written
after exhaustive interviews with 67 member firms. A German newspaper, which
obtained a leaked copy, reported that a key criticism was the poor image
of the annual meeting, especially the unbusiness-like locations selected
- such as Cannes. <BR>
<BR>
In the coffee session, the regional representatives, the power-wielding
mediators between the board and Isma members in different countries, moaned
about the vague three-page summary of the report that they had received.
&quot;It is all very sinister. I am not happy,&quot; said one regional baron.
<BR>
<BR>
The morning ended with the nailbiting elections to the 15-strong Isma board.
Which of the five candidates would get the five board places up for grabs?
No such cliff-hanger had been seen since the re-election of Enver Hoxha.
All of them made it. Even - for the first time - a woman, Tinny
Hasendonckx, head of Eurobond trading at Kredietbank. <BR>
<BR>
Isma chief executive John Langton announced that next year's venue would
be Singapore and added, to whet the bondsmen's jaded palates: &quot;I understand
Mr Leeson may be there if he gets time off for good behaviour.&quot; <HR>
<H2>... Trichet caught napping on Emu </H2>
After a hard night at the Cedel party, in which both Brazilian dancers and
the alcohol flowed in equal measure, it was surprising that virtually all
the delegates turned up the next morning for the final debate of the Isma
meeting in Cannes - on European monetary union (Emu). <BR>
<BR>
The first speaker was Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Banque de France
who called Emu &quot;not that extraordinary an adventure&quot; and pointed
out that six currencies representing 170 million people have had no re-alignment
in the past nine and a half years. He sprinkled his speech with the phrase
&quot;When the time comes...and the time will come.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Lord Lawson, former UK chancellor of the exchequer, put things back on a
saner footing, and called Trichet, &quot;a man who represents the best side
of the formidable French bureaucracy.&quot; The Germans in the audience
were still laughing as Lawson launched into an anti-Emu tirade that pointed
out that 1998 was the 50th anniversary of the Deutschmark, and that the
Bundesbank was not about to allow in the &quot;profligate Club Med countries&quot;
such as Italy and Spain. <BR>
<BR>
Moreover, he noted the chances of the Maastricht criteria being met were
slim - if you examined objective forecasts, such as those of the IMF:
&quot;I stress the word 'objective', because there are also forecasts produced
by the European Commission.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Isma chairman Rijnhard van Tets joked: &quot;We've had the bid and offer
side of the trade. Now we need to find an American broker to match it.&quot;
The chosen broker was Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International
Economics, and a man who was clearly used to keeping his audience rapt.
He gave his views on the dollar, and halfway through Trichet fell so deep
into contemplation that his eyes closed - for a long time. Dazed delegates
picked up their free Isma umbrellas and left. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Steven Irvine</B> <HR>
<H2>My wine is my bond, and I drink my coupons </H2>
It's a bond that guarantees a fruity aftermarket performance, and looks
set to mature in five years with a full bouquet. The debut issue of Chateau
Teyssier, a vineyard, pays its coupons every June in wine. <BR>
<BR>
Matrix Securities is lead managing the issue of 375 'winebonds'. &quot;Make
sure the red is open for at least half an hour. Pour it into a glass and
stare at it for a bit,&quot; advises Matrix syndicate manager, David Royds.
<BR>
<BR>
The bond will entitle the holder to receive six cases of either the chateau's
claret or its ros&eacute; in the proportion of its choice from 1997 to 2001,
and more importantly four cases of the prestigious Saint Emilion Grand Cru
between 1998 and 2002. The retail value of the wine is &#163;5,000, but
the bond will cost &#163;2,650. <BR>
<BR>
Matrix Securities is more normally involved in tax-break products in the
UK rather than bonds, but the Savile Row-based firm says that after April
this business goes quiet. Englishman Jonathan Maltus approached it to launch
a wine bond for his Bordeaux vineyard, Chateau Teyssier. The $1.5 million
of proceeds will be used to modernize and expand production, and buy some
Saint Emilion vines. <BR>
<BR>
Maltus concedes that the &quot;vintage is at the mercy of the gods&quot;.
But the less expensive ros&eacute; is well regarded, and recently won a
bronze medal at an international wine challenge. The ros&eacute; and claret
sell for roughly half the price of the grand cru and are designed to be
drunk now while the bondholder lays down the cru, waiting for it to mature.
<BR>
<BR>
Yann Gindre, a debt origination supremo at BZW and thought by some to be
the Andr&eacute; Simon of the bond markets, was not over-impressed with
the claret. After a couple of glasses he pronounced it &quot;a tightly priced
issue that will sell at full fees.&quot; He added: &quot;It may need a strong
underlying market to perform.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately the more pricey Saint Emilion Grand Cru, which will attract
most bond investors' attention, was not available for tasting. It will not
be consumable till August. But <I>Euromoney</I>'s Friday afternoon research
team concur if you choose to buy this bond it is worth shorting the claret
in favour of the ros&eacute;. <BR>

<H2>A sporting chance </H2>
Did you ever want your own a football club when you were a lad? Well, you
just might be able to, thanks to Momentum Premier Sports, an investment
vehicle the sponsors claim is the world's first ever hedge fund devoted
to the burgeoning world of sports business. Bermuda-based, the fund aims
to capitalize on the ever-increasing commercialization of sport. <BR>
<BR>
Publicly-quoted Manchester United has seen the value of its shares rise
by over 60% in the eight months to May 1996 in a season in which it won
both the English League championship and the FA Cup; north of the border,
Scotland's historic Celtic club has seen its share price rise by over 135%
even in a season in which it failed to halt arch-rivals Rangers eighth Scottish
Championship in a row. <BR>
<BR>
But betting on match results is for the gambling industry, according to
Michael Goldman, South African-born managing director of the Momentum Group.
Instead, the fund aims to capitalize on the growing amount of money being
channelled into sport as a business - particularly from TV deals -
and many clubs' position as valuable, and still underdeveloped franchises.
<BR>
<BR>
But although football clubs may form the glamour end of the fund's targeted
investments, they are likely to form only a minor portion of its eventual
assets. Sports clothing and equipment manufacturers will be the main targets
for the fund's managers. The prospectus mentions its desire to invest in
manufacturers of such diverse products as mountaineering crampons, game-fishing
landing nets, snooker triangles, sailing buoyancy aids and archery flights.
Alongside Manchester United, Momentum Premier is already invested in sportswear
company Nike and motorbike manufacturer Harley Davidson (admittedly not
a core holding, said Goldman). <BR>
<BR>
But if sport is the theme of the fund, its leitmotif is the wisdom of stock
market legend Warren Buffet. &quot;You've got to buy what you know,&quot;
says Goldman. He promised that he would not fall sway to any emotional purchases
of shares in his personal favourite Chelsea, the perennially underachieving
West London football team. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Mark Johnson</B> <HR>
<H2>Sour at krauts </H2>
Black Wednesday hit the city of London on June 26. But it was nothing to
do with stock markets. Rather, the despairing stares resulted from Germany's
<BR>
<BR>
6-5 penalty shootout win over England in the semi-final of the Euro 96 football
championship. <BR>
<BR>
It was perhaps the most important football match played on English soil
for 30 years, so the rivalries between German and English bankers ran high.
On Wednesday afternoon, pre-emptive strikes were made between London and
Frankfurt with heavily-worded, medium-range e-mails. The famous German sense
of humour came into play leaving some in the city unable to syndicate bonds.
<BR>
<BR>
One 'joke' went: &quot;England cannot win the Euro 96 because Queen Elizabeth
does not want to get kissed by Gazza.&quot; Gazza, alias Paul Gascoigne,
is an artistic English midfielder. <BR>
<BR>
But on Thursday the Germans, the eventual Euro 96 winners, had the last
laugh. And unfortunately, the morning conference call to Frankfurt could
not be avoided. But at one UK house, a syndicate manager set the tone for
the day when he said: &quot;Germany, you're not welcome.&quot; Another syndicate
head, barely smirking, recounted that he cut back German orders throughout
the day, &quot;just to annoy them&quot;. Who said the English were good
losers? <BR>
<BR>
<B>Franz Beckenbauer</B> <HR>
<H2>Chase's chase </H2>
Spare a thought for one small victim of merger mania, the Manufacturers
Hanover Run, which two years ago was renamed the Chemical Bank Corporate
Challenge and now has been seized by the Chase marketing machine. Ten years
ago a few hundred runners panted five kilometres round the deserted streets
of the City of London on a summer evening. Finishers got a T-shirt and a
small bronze medal. Then, as the cult of the Gladiator seized the financial
markets, the event migrated to Battersea Park and drew thousands of participants.
One year the race was split in two - one evening for the elite, and
another for the not so elite. <BR>
<BR>
Chemical Bank carried on the Manny Hanny tradition. But the brochure writers
for this year's race on July 10 clearly couldn't resist an unparalleled
marketing opportunity. Every page contains a &quot;Chase fact&quot; -
for example that &quot;Chase is a top-tier player in project finance&quot;
or &quot;Chase is a market leader in FX&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Morgan Stanley, which is fielding 260 runners, will have to improve on the
legend worn on their backs last year: &quot;The runner in front is from
Morgan Stanley.&quot; We learn that very few of these T-shirts were read.
A slightly different problem faced Mellon Bank whose female entrants understandably
refused to wear the word Mellon on their front. <BR>

<B>Japan's bacteria-free banking</B>
</H2>
<P>
Japan is money-launderering.

<P>
Sanwa Bank's latest automatic teller machines (ATM) in Japan not only count the yen notes they dispense, they also press and sanitize them to eliminate germs. Just like the crisp, clean sheets one expects from a laundry.

<P>
"It may not be crucial to public health, but our customers are definitely more comfortable using clean ATMs," says Sanwa spokesman Hidehito Mori.

<P>
Personal hygiene has long been esteemed in Japan. The long ritual soak in the piping hot <I>o-furo</I> (honourable bath) is an obvious manifestation of this. 

<P>
But this year's mysterious food-poisoning epidemic caused by a strain of colonic bacteria has turned it into a national obsession. Demand for sanitary saxophones, bicycle grips, and karaoke equipment made from antiseptic plastic has skyrocketed. The deadly dangers lurking in public lavatories prompted bathroom accessories maker Toto to market a battery-powered, refillable portable bidet called Travel Washlet that is about the size of a paperback book and retails for about &#165;18,000 ($160). It has already sold more than 130,000.

<P>
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi has aptly caught the public mood with a Total Anti-Germ Branch in an affluent suburb of Tokyo.

<P>
Every interior surface with which customers may come into physical contact has been indelibly saturated with chemicals that resist bacteria and fungi.

<P>
Spokesman Kazutaka Umegaki says it is especially popular with "young female customers, many of whom say they don't want to touch things handled by middle-aged men". 

<P>

<H2>
<B>Dresdner swoops to conquer</B>
</H2>
<P>
"There goes the share price," said a voice out of the darkness as the green crescent of laser light which had been drawing sweeping curves over the facade of Dresdner Bank's tower took a sudden plunge to earth. 

<P>
    A group of journalists watching the show loudly enjoyed the joke, but even in the anonymous darkness there was mirthless silence from the Deutsche Telekom contingent &#173; led by chief executive Ron Sommer, finance director Joachim Kr&ouml;ske and some of their favourite bankers including Hansgeorg Hofmann of Dresdner and Ronaldo Schmitz of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.

<P>
To commemorate the Dm14 billion flotation of Deutsche Telekom, Dresdner Bank was making its mark with a laser show "which transformed the bank's tower into an enthralling beacon of light". Projected from the European Monetary Institute building onto Dresdner's <BR>
31-storey headquarters, the laser performed imaginative variations on the green Dresdner crescent and Telekom's pink dots-and-T-sign logo. No expense was spared: the bank said that 20 technicians took six days and used more than a mile of cabling to set up the 30 specially constructed spotlights. 

<P>
Effort and expense were rewarded the next day, when the Dresdner Bank tower featured in every Frankfurt newspaper. Dresdner, while coming from behind, had nevertheless triumphed in a new form of rivalry between the three global coordinators of the Telekom deal &#173; Goldman, Deutsche and Dresdner. 

<P>
Two days earlier almost all Frankfurt's tallest buildings had been opened to the public in a Skyscraper-Fest, giving ordinary Frankfurters an aerial view of their city for the first time. Demand from the grass roots was strongest for the 240-metre Messeturm, home of Goldman Sachs, followed by Deutsche Bank's twin towers. <B>&#009;Laura Covill</B>

<H2>
<B>Vaporware and the year 2000</B>
</H2>
<P>
Computer software analysts reckon that it will cost around 75 cents per line of code to change banks' and business' computers to cope with the year 2000. That implies a total worldwide cost of $500 billion. What's worse, in many jurisdictions, such as the UK, updating computer programmes is not accounted for as capital expenditure. It has to be taken as a hit to profits. 

<P>
Software consultants have come up with some bizarre suggestions to cope with the simultaneous challenges of 2000 and the European single currency. Consultants have pondered ways to con computers into thinking that they have been switched back to 1900 or 1949. 

<P>
But you have to be careful with computer consultants. One admits: "There's a lot of vaporware out there." (This is computer geek-speak for bullshit.) Some have even suggested that the whole European monetary union project should be postponed because it will compete for information technology resources with the 2000 crisis.  &#009;<B>Peter Lee</B>

<H2>
<B>Deutsche's dark horse</B>
</H2>
<P>
Josef Ackermann is the unknown quantity catapulted into Deutsche Bank's executive boardroom on October 30. The 48-year-old resigned from Credit Suisse at the end of June when he found himself passed over as chief executive. Now the rumour mills suggest that the one-time crown prince of Credit Suisse hasn't lost his royal touch.

<P>
Veteran board member Rolf Breuer was named to succeed speaker Hilmar Kopper next May. Kopper himself, with Ulrich Cartellieri, leaves the executive board for the supervisory board. One forecast is that the 58-year-old Breuer won't be there more than two years before Ackermann takes over. 

<P>
While the 126-year-old German bank might not yet have the stomach for an Anglo-Saxon chief executive, a Swiss-German global banker might be an acceptable halfway house.

<P>
Twin tower-watchers don't see the departure of Kopper and Cartellieri from the executive board as a sign of displeasure. But there were foul-ups &#173; Eurasbank for Cartellieri, Metallgesellschaft, Schneider, Kl&ouml;ckner and Morgan Grenfell Asset Management for Kopper.

<P>
The moves were triggered by the ill-health of supervisory board chairman Wilhelm Christians. Traditionally the speaker succeeds the chairman. Kopper is likely to be no exception.

<P>
There are high hopes that Breuer can build bridges between the  footsoldiers in Frankfurt and the high-rolling mercenaries at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. He knows about investment banking, but his mind is firmly shackled to Finanzplatz Frankfurt.

<P>
Breuer's hectic schedule is legendary. So much so that when one supplicant finally cornered him at an IMF meeting and said "Ah, Mr Breuer, it seems you have some time for conversation," the great man studied his watch and said as he moved away: "Unfortunately you have just missed your opportunity."

<H2>
<B>How much if he dies?</B>
</H2>
<P>
They say every man's life has a price. But Boris Yeltsin's could be particularly expensive.

<P>
This was the verdict during a conference in Moscow last month in which the subject of the president's death came up.

<P>
Speakers from the major industrial banks studiously avoided the coronary issue. 

<P>
But a panel of investors bit the bullet on how much everyone stood to lose should the president become "incapacitated".

<P>
The Cassandra of the bunch was William Browder of Hermitage Capital Management, who predicted a 35% sell-off on definitive bad news from the Kremlin hospital. Particularly ravaged, he said, would be the five blue chips which account for half the trades in the Moscow market: Lukoil, United Energy System, Rostelekom, Mosenergo and Irkutskenergo. Lucky thing, then, that Browder's own firm specializes in not yet listed companies.

<P>
Mark Cooke of Brunswick Capital Management, the Swedish-Russian brokerage which is a market-maker in the blue chip trade, shot back that Yeltsin dying in office would be a "buying opportunity". The Russian market is controlled by a small group of veteran investors, "who are not here because they're scared to death of risk," he argued.

<P>
CS First Boston Russian equities chief Peter Halloran, who watched the debate from the audience, saw wisdom in both views. His own analysis puts the postmortem drop at 30%, he said. "But then there are a lot of buyers out there waiting for that weakness to get in."

<P>
James Fenkner, head researcher at CentreInvest Securities, suggested: "A lot depends on how Yeltsin dies." The market would recover within three weeks from a death by natural causes, he predicted. "But if he is assassinated, then it depends on which minister was behind it."

<P>
<B>&#009;Craig Mellow</B>

<H2>
<B>Cavallo controversy</B>
</H2>
<P>
How are the mighty fallen. Domingo Cavallo, only months ago hailed as Argentina's economic Messiah, was sacked in July and is now being vilified by former cabinet colleagues. One suggested he was mad, another that he should be locked up (for three years, no less), and yet another that he was a traitor. President Carlos Menem, while praising Cavallo as one of Argentina's most outstanding economy ministers, accused him of having moved to the opposition ranks. 

<P>
What had begun in July as the orderly passing of the economic baton from Cavallo to Roque Fernandez, his successor, had degenerated by October. 

<P>
Cavallo alleged that interior minister, Carlos Corach, had boasted to him that he regularly manipulated the judicial system. Corach had even written the names of  judges he controlled on the back of a table napkin, he added. Then came the turn of Alberto Kohan, general-secretary to the presidency, whom Cavallo testified may have known about bribes paid to secure the award of a $250 million contract to IBM. "There is no justice and no security in Argentina," Cavallo told a New York audience. 

<P>
The former minister may be acting partly in self-defence. He faces a number of pending lawsuits and may see mileage in discrediting the legal system. 

<P>
But Cavallo says that, should Argentina need him, he would run for president in 1999  &#173; though he jokes he may be in jail before then. His running-mate would be Ramon "Palito" Ortega, a former shoeshine boy who rose to enormous fame throughout the region as a crooner of ballads. Cavallo says Ortega has the charisma he lacks, and knows how to talk (or sing) to the people. 

<P>
There may be a pattern here. After his sacking, Cavallo became an adviser to Abdala Bucaram, Ecuador's newly elected president. Like Menem and Ortega, Bucaram is highly charismatic. And one of his first acts after winning the presidential election, to boost his popularity still further, was to cut a record.

<B>The dancing dealer</B>
</H2>
<P>
"It was a gamble," says Mike Winter, a contemporary dancer, "but I've been unbelievably lucky. The gamble paid off."

<P>
Winter, a former Barclays foreign exchange dealer, resigned his job to become a dancer on the same day he was promoted. "I've been in more or less permanent work for the past three-and-a-half years," he says, "which is unheard of in the dance world."

<P>
Winter has toured internationally with Transitions Dance Company, Man Act, and Mind the Gap Tanztheater among others. He is now touring Britain with <I>Tenement</I>, "an eccentric excursion into bedsit land" inspired by Edward Hopper. "I may not be earning very much," he says, "but I'm a lot happier."&#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;     &#009;<B>Felix Salmon</B>

<H2>The joys of criticism </H2>
<H4>Unless developing economies embrace the culture of criticism, they will
be poorer and less happy places <BR>
<BR>
</H4><I>By Gerald Segal, <BR>
senior fellow at London's International Institute for Strategic Studies
and director of Britain's Pacific Asia Programme<BR>
<BR>
</I>Why are people so touchy about criticism? Salman Rushdie writes a book
that some Muslims find objectionable, and the Iranian Ayatollah Khomeini
reacts with a death sentence. Harry Wu writes about prison camps and the
jumpy Chinese authorities arrest him and stage a show trial. <BR>
<BR>
The Saudis mutter job threats about London-based dissident Mohammad Al-Mas'ari
and the British government threatens to send him to a small Caribbean island.
Former US president Richard Nixon's actions to strike back at his critics
led to a major scandal and his eventual resignation. <BR>
<BR>
In Singapore, officials sue newspapers and minor academics for writing inconsequential
articles with opinions that differ from the ruling consensus. Indeed, many
east Asian governments are now claiming that because they have supposedly
distinctive &quot;Asian values&quot; they have no need for pluralist democracy:
only four east Asian countries have experienced a change of government in
the last 30 years. <BR>
<BR>
On the one hand, such thin-skinned people and governments seem to be running
against the tide of history: there are more pluralist democracies than ever
before and eastern Europe, Japan and South Korea are the most recent cases
where free elections have changed governments. The joys of criticism are
clearly great, for no country which has enjoyed sustained freedom voluntarily
chooses to give it up - hence the depths of the unique tragedy of handing
the free people of Hong Kong to a still unfree China. But even where the
habit is strongest, appreciation and understanding of its role is precarious.
The phenomenon needs to be defended and spelled out from time to time. <BR>
<BR>
It is not surprising that authoritarian governments dislike criticism: as
an 18th century English proverb has it, &quot;a blind man will not thank
you for a looking-glass&quot;. The difficult cases lie somewhere in the
grey area between the clear-cut democracies and the rigid authoritarians.
Most of them are developing states, who face the challenge of deciding whether
and how to adopt the principles of the Enlightenment that lie at the heart
of political pluralism. <BR>
<BR>
The Enlightenment embraces three key principles essential to the critical
arts. The first, a cornerstone of the Judeo-Christian revolution, is
the idea that in the long run the human condition gets better. All other
civilisations saw history as circular but without a sense of progress it
is difficult to understand that people will not choose to give up economic
and personal freedom. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Individualism and openness </B><BR>
<BR>
The second notion of the Enlightenment is acceptance of a central role for
the individual. The ancient Greeks gave us that essential Delphic maxim,
know thyself, and understood the centrality of knowing what it is to be
human. Later England's quiet Glorious Revolution and the French revolution
gave us the notion of the rights of man, which shifted the balance of sovereignty
to the individual and away from the collective or the governing elite. While
the precise mix of individual rights is always changing, once the individual
is empowered it is harder for power to flow back to elites. <BR>
<BR>
The third notion, the value of openness, flows from the first
two and herein lies the joys of criticism. Without a large degree of openness
there can be no sustained innovation, no market economics, no sustained
economic growth. Governments and companies cannot succeed without openness.
<BR>
<BR>
The origins of openness lie with that other great Greek invention, science.
Somewhere in the 8th to 6th century BC, the Greeks understood that objective
truth could and should be tested. Technological progress through innovation
was impossible without that idea, one never shared in ancient China. Openness
to objective truth lies at the heart of education: it stands starkly opposed
to the notion that all values are relative and critical choice therefore
unnecessary or undesirable. And of course openness to truth requires freedom
for effective criticism. <BR>
<BR>
The critical act - its roots are in the Greek notion of discernment
- is an essential prerequisite for discerning the existence and nature
of problems. If problems are left unsolved, they destroy the legitimacy
of government or the competitive advantage of enterprises. How does a company
know if it is losing its edge? It must be told that it is doing something
wrong: it must be criticised. Criticism is not only the key to recognising
problems, it is also the secret of productivity and innovation. <BR>
<BR>
As economist Paul Krugman has pointed out, much to the annoyance of many
fast-growing states and companies, improvements in total factor productivity
require improvements in management skills, innovative science and technology.
Firms can only add a certain amount of labour and capital to boost productivity,
before they must seek growth through improved management and innovation.
But managers need to be told when they are failing. They need to be sent
back to management schools and have sufficiently open minds to learn from
their rivals. One cannot judge what is best without a willingness to make
critical judgements. <BR>
<BR>
Nor can innovation in science and technology be sustained without a critical
environment. Authoritarians like to point to the high percentage of schoolgoers
in their country but basic education is only part of the strategy for success.
A competitive edge in car manufacturing can come from better staff health
care management or from the computer chips that make cars efficient: making
and bending steel is only a minor part of the process. With developed economies
increasingly becoming service economies, this process only grows in importance:
most innovation in management and technology still comes from the OECD world
and without a critical environment other countries may not keep pace. The
brighter students will go to university in North America or Europe, and
most will stay. <BR>
<BR>
Of course there are limits to criticism: all pluralist democracies recognise
the need to limit slander, libel and fraud. Racism and other forms of incitement
of bigotry and hatred are often outlawed, although efforts are made not
to outlaw mere opinion. As Salman Rushdie reminded us in the face of the
<I>fatwa </I>against him, intellectual freedom means nothing if it does
not allow the freedom to offend. And as <I>The Economist</I> has recently
argued: &quot;Government's job is to protect minorities from physical harm,
not from odious argument.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Another danger of unbridled criticism is the evolution of what the internationally
known art critic, historian and polemicist Robert Hughes has called the
&quot;culture of complaint&quot;. Supporters of the notion of Asian values
often say that criticism and complaint can go too far. As that Chinese proverb
has it, &quot;Do not use a hatchet to remove a fly from your friend's
forehead&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
<B>A culture of criticism </B><BR>
<BR>
Excessive and unrelenting criticism can increase the risks of the fragmentation
of society but this is not inevitable, as long as people understand that
there are limits to complaint when it risks undermining the core value of
criticism. It is the very strength of a &quot;culture of criticism&quot;
that allows critics of criticism to help redress the balance. <BR>
<BR>
The key to retaining the joys of a culture of criticism is tolerance. Complex
economies and political systems have complex societies. Where people once
defined themselves by gender and perhaps tribe, they now include specific
forms of occupation, lifestyle and interests. Such complex forms are vital
to a healthy service economy, not to mention personal development and satisfaction.
Those who resist such forces are, in the long run, doomed to be poorer and
less happy. <p>

It's a jungle out here, so truly I may just as well be in the office, but Ken signals me to find a few days and come out to join him, he is here in Zimbabwe on one of the overseas fact-finding visits which he sets up whenever he runs low on duty free cheroots, and now it seems he needs advice, or rather he has more advice than he requires but he wants mine.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>I</B> see quite a lot of Ken these days, he is a kinda rolypoly jokey guy in British politics who draws the short straw and becomes finance minister, only since it is the Brits they fit him out a tin box and call him Chancellor and this is all part of immemorial tradition, like a crisis for the pound.

His guy Steve tells me Ken is hooked on the City, meaning the end of London where the markets are, someone tells him this is a great export industry, tho' when I first arrive the old hands put it kinda differently, Herbie, they tell me, we just shovel money around the world and hang onto what sticks to the shovel.

Anyhow, says Steve, Ken figures what it needs now is a panel, some right thinking guys who can put their heads together with him and help make it mightier yet, so calls are going out to round up the usual suspects, and some unusual ones too, our panel must show how truly international this financial center is, so we ask nice Mr T from Nomura who is everyone's favourite Japanese, and by the way, Herbie, you're tapped.

<B>O</B>n the day we all roll along to what turns out to be an intimate little panel, as panels go, just Ken and Eddie and the mayor and some spare ministers and Win and Mr T and me and the guy from Citi and a small crowd of extras, Ken gives us all a big hello, he says he hopes we pull this act together, the next time he flies all the way to Brazil to beat up business for us he does not wish to be told he is too late and the Duke of Kent leaves yesterday, it is not worth it (Ken says) just for the cheroots.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I see no harm in all this but everybody else does, spontaneous combustion sets in and umbrage is generated in industrial quantities, anyone who does not get an invitation wishes to know why and Holey Buckett says the Stock Exchange's board are puce with fury, they figure this panel is somewhere they can park their chief executive, and now they have to think of something else, like ambushing him on the 22nd floor and pushing him out of the window.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Everybody with an invitation is suspicious, too, they figure is this all part of a sinister plot for Ken to tell them what to do, or worse still he may take their toys away and give them to the boy next door, this guy Michael makes a pitch for City Hall to lead the export effort, for one thing, he says, we have the money, well, of course they have, they take it off the rest of us and if we do not pay they put us in the slammer.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We get this far when a disembodied voice starts booming at us, this makes me jump but Steve explains it speaks for some outfit called British Invisibles, out of sight, out of mind, murmurs Steve, while the voice asks how dare Michael try to horn in, and at this the fight becomes general, until finally Ken bangs for order and complains how the grinding of axes quite deafens him.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I feel for the guy, he tries to give us all a leg up and get bitten in the butt for his pains, so I pass a note and urge him to adjourn the meeting, have the Treasury put out a statement claiming we are only here to talk about information technology, and next time round lock everybody in and keep them out of lunch until they promise to behave, to guys like these, I say, lunch is the great healer and missing out on it is the ultimate deterrent.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Afterwards he thanks me, he says this is the kind of advice he needs more of, and do I care to come on his panel of special advisers, or seven wise men, he is one short, they are something he inherits from his predecessor along with a &#163;50 billion deficit, the idea is where you get seven economists you get eight opinions, which means that they feud with each other and take the heat off the Treasury, I just sit thru their advice (he says) and let them get on with it, but maybe you can do better.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mom, I can only try, I knock out some learned notes on the significance of steeper yield curves, worldwide, and Holey gets some analyst to have his computer draw a graph for me, but I wonder why I bother, when this panel meets I cannot get a word in edgeways, it becomes a straight shootout between two angry monetarists, naturally they do not agree what money is or what the numbers mean, no monetarists do.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>T</B>his does not stop them agreeing how Ken gets it wrong, in opposite directions, Tim from Lombard Street says Ken is a reckless money printer and must take his foot off the accelerator now, before he skids off the circuit in the year 2000, but Patrick from Liverpool tells him to take his foot off the brake, and shave 200 basis points off the discount rate or move over and make way for someone who can.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
They go hammer and tongs and call each other menaces and crypto-Keynesians and bananas, and evil geniuses of the last disaster or the last but one, until Ken scrawls a note to me and asks what I think, and I scrawl back saying if he splits the difference they tell him that he gets it right, but I figure he does best to leave them to it and take off on the next fact-finder.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Sometimes, he explains to me over a sundowner, I am tempted to take some of Patrick's advice, starting with the last bit, but Zimbabwe is a great place for finding facts, Bob Mugabe has the knack, none of this nonsense about holding referendums, and at election time everybody else is too polite to run against him, now, Herbie, advise me, how do we fix that back home, Mom, I am not sure but I offer to find out who advises Bob Mugabe, much love from
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<H3> <B>Jitters hit Latin market as Brazil lines up global</B> </H3> 

<P><H4> <B>THE FEDERATIVE Republic of Brazil
will begin roadshows for its $750m global bond next week, hoping to overcome an
increasingly nervous tone in the Latin American debt market.</B></H4>As foreshadowed
by <I>Euroweek</I> last Friday, Brazil has formally mandated JP Morgan and SBC
Warburg to lead the country's return to the dollar market for the first time
since the 1980s debt crisis.

<P> The global bond is likely to have a five-year maturity, although a 10-year
deal or a two-tranche five and 10-year offering are being touted as alternatives.

<P> Brazil's dollar  return been eagerly awaited for much of the year. But the
announcement was almost immediately followed by ominous signs that the boom in
the Latin fixed-income markets may have peaked.

<P> So far this year returns on some Latin American Brady bonds have exceeded
33%, leading to a bout of profit-taking by traders and investors in recent days.

<P> Also spooking the market over the last week was a 4% tumble in the value of
the Mexican peso to trade at around 7.8 pesos to the <BR> US dollar.

<P> Former Argentine economics minister Domingo Cavallo's attack on president
Menem and accusations of corruption in congress heightened tensions, while a
barrage of US data revived volatility in the US Treasury bond market.

<P> Most disturbing, however, were the first signs that investors are starting to
balk at ultra-aggressive Latin bond issues being launched as a result of highly
competitive bidding for mandates.

<P> Against this background, bankers are looking at the Brazilian global bond as
a key indicator of future market sentiment.

<P> "The Brazilian transaction is going to be a barometer for the market in the
near term," said a syndicate head in New York.

<P> The global bond is due for roadshows in New York, Asia and Europe in the
coming week, with pricing due in the week beginning October 28.

<P> There are concerns that Brazil might need to revise its aggressive pricing
aspirations to ensure that its first dollar deal since 1982 is a major success.
Initial expectations are for a spread in the 220bp to 240bp range at the
five-year mark.

<P> "The market is very jittery," said a senior trader in Brazil. "It's been a
tremendous year and there is no fundamental reason to say this run-up will not
continue. But technically the market is getting heavier and people are saying 'we
have been lucky and maybe we should take profits now'."

<P> Emerging market investors usually close their books for the year in mid to
late November. The past week's selling has been mainly by trading houses, looking
to take profits before end-investors come in <I>en masse</I> to lock in their own
profits.

<P> Bankers cited the fate of Pemex's tightly-priced $300m three-year deal, this
week trading well above its 175bp spread launch, as evidence of investors'
increasing aversion to aggressively priced deal.

<P> "The Pemex deal is now trading around 205bp," said a syndicate head. "So
that's a good indication that if conditions get more choppy, that deals to get
done properly will have to be better marketed and negotiated and that these very
bull market type of deals are not what the market will take."

<P> Said another: "I think the events that unfold (surrounding the deal) will be
indicative of whether we tread water for a while here or whether we are going to
make more progress. A lot of that doesn't have to do with Brazil, but the overall
market sentiment."

<P> Expectations are that Brazil will opt to launch a five-year global, so as to
widen its investor base to include strong European as well as US interest.

<P> Even so, it is understood that Brazil has not closed its mind entirely to a
10-year tranche or deal and will make a decision after its roadshow in the week
ahead.

<P> The market consensus appears to be that Brazil will be able to launch a
five-year deal in the 220bp to 240bp region if the strong underlying investor
demand for high-yielding paper continues. If that momentum breaks, however, then
such a tight spread could be problematic, warn some bankers.

<P> "Clearly it will be a challenge," said a syndicate head. "The market is going
through a little bit of a correction."

<P> Brazil will want to launch an offering inside of state oil firm Petrobras,
which recently priced a two-tranche five and 10-year $375m offering.

<P> That deal's five year tranche was launched at a spread of 250bp, which
tightened into around 235bp and was on Thursday trading about 250bp again.

<P> The 10-year portion was launched at 350bp, tightened in to 330bp and was on
Thursday trading around 360bp.

<P> The problem for Brazil is that Petrobras has set a very tight benchmark at a
time when better-rated Argentina and Mexico are trading far wider in five-year
maturities.

<P> Argentine 2001s were trading on Thursday at around 410bp from 370bp the
previous week and UMS 2001s were at 335bp bid/325bp offered from 285bp the
previous week.

<P> Many bankers argue, however, that Gustavo Franco, the Brazilian central bank
director of external affairs, is  aware that Brazil needs its first dollar global
to be a successful deal.

<P> This is important to establish a good image in the dollar market, but also to
facilitate Brazil's plans to embark shortly on a more proactive management of its
Brady debt.

<P> But two Brazilian corporate deals done in the past week are proof that the
bid for high-yielding securities is still very strong for sensibly priced Latin
offerings.

<P> Brazilian petrochemical company <B>Petroquimica</B> was able to increase its
$75m eight year/put five Euro/144A offering, led by CS First Boston, to $100m and
price it at 460bp. The deal tightened in the aftermarket to trade around 455bp.

<P> <B>Ford Brasil</B>, which debuted with an eight year put and call five year
Eurobond led by ABN AMRO, was also able to increase its offering from around
$200m initially to $300m.

<P> The deal was priced at 283bp from a spread talk of 280bp to 290bp and
maintained its re-offer spread after breaking syndicate.

<P> Investors are also lining up for <B>Femsa</B>, the Mexican Coca-Cola bottler
which is due to make its $175m 10-year debut in the Yankee market via JP Morgan
in the next two weeks.

<P> Mexican state-owned bank <B>Banobras</B> is also due to come to market in the
weeks ahead with a $250m seven-year Yankee bond in the mid to high 300bp region,
led  Morgan Stanley.

<H3> Dresdner KB beefs up Eurobond business </H3> 

<P>
DRESDNER Kleinwort Benson has acquired <B>Luthy Baillie Dowsett and Pethick</B>
(LBDP), the London fixed-income boutique, in an attempt to boost its presence in
the Eurobond markets.

<P> "This will broaden our business by increasing the depth of our credit and
non-DM activity," said Erich Pohl, co-head of global markets at Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson in Frankfurt.

<P> The move does not, however, represent a wholesale shift of debt business
to London. "Clearly, the competence of the DM business is very strong and that is
not going to change," said Pohl. "Deutschmark activity will remain in Frankfurt
and in general no people will move from Frankfurt to London."

<P> While Euro-DM origination, distribution and trading will remain physically
rooted in Frankfurt, as spread businesses they will fall into the domain of Peter
Luthy and Jan Pethick.

<P> They will be responsible for primary and secondary spread business in all
major currencies, reporting to Pohl and Leonhard Fischer, joint heads of global
markets in Frankfurt, as well as to David Clementi, the London-based CEO of
Kleinwort Benson.

<P> Luthy will join the global markets management committee of Dresdner KB.

<P> John Dowsett, one of the founding partners of the boutique, will join on the
operations and administrations side. Ian Baillie, the other founding partner, had
earlier left to become senior sterling trader at Salomon Brothers.

<P> In all, said Luthy, 15 people would be moving into Kleinwort's London
offices.

<P> Dresdner's move can be seen as imaginative -- success in fixed income is
often judged in terms of league table position, and the hiring of a well-known
origination heavy hitter might be a more obvious way of addressing perceived
weaknesses in new-issue mandate generation.

<P> Since its establishment in March 1990 LBDP has built up a research-based
reputation in credit trading. Pohl said that focus did not preclude strong links
with the primary markets and said he expected the new arrangements to have an
impact on Dresdner KB's new issue business from an early stage.

<P> Luthy added that the credit expertise of LBDP was particularly relevant for
spread businesses, where bond selection was more important than interest rate and
timing decisions. These should remain the province of the government bond
markets.

<P> Dresdner KB lies 18th in Bondware's league table of all international bond
bookrunners. 

<H3> PEOPLE </H3>

<P> Peter Foy, a senior director of consulting firm McKinsey, is to join
<B>Baring Brothers</B> as chairman. Foy, who will take up his 2-1/2 days a week
position in January 1997, steps into a gap left by Andrew Tuckey, who resigned
after Barings' purchase by ING following its derivatives debacle. 

<P> <B>HSBC Investment Bank</B> has hired Richard Tolkien as managing director in
the corporate finance and advisory department. He will join the bank from
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, where he was global head of utilities. He joins
mid-January 1997 and will have particular responsibility for international
corporate finance.

<P> Lindsay Searle has joined <B>Paribas</B> as head of corporate communications
in the UK. She will be responsible for communications for capital markets
activities (equity and fixed income) worldwide, as well as for all of Paribas'
activities in the UK.

<P> Searle joins Paribas from Gartmore plc where she was head of corporate
communications for five years. She has also worked for Morgan Stanley
International and the Securities and Investments Board.

<P> <B>Salomon Bros</B> has appointed Sophie Stylianou as London-based head of
Latin American equity sales for Europe. Her duties will include those formerly
handled by John Parker, who recently left the firm.

<P> Stylianou previously worked as a Latin American salesperson at BZW in London.

<P> Guarav Seth has joined <B>ANZ Investment Bank</B> as an Associate in the
global structured finance group. He will be responsible for working on the
structuring of cross border debt products for South Asia. He will report to Chris
Vermont, director and head of specialist finance and global syndications in
London.

<P> Dr Mark Sullivan has joined the corporate finance division of <B>UBS
Limited</B> as managing director and, with Alan Norris, joint head of the bank's
chemicals group. Sullivan joins from Robert Fleming, where he was a director and
worked for the past five years.

<P> <B>HSBC James Capel</B> has announced three moves designed to expand and
develop its investment strategy function. Peter Oppenheimer has been appointed
European strategist, to apply the bank's global investment process to the whole
of continental Europe.

<P> Bill O'Neill replaces Oppenheimer as international investment strategist,
while Oliver Kamm has been appointed to the newly created role of european
quantative strategist.

<P> Lou Ricciardelli has been appointed chief administrative officer and head of
finance, technology and operations for global equities at <B>NatWest Markets</B>.
He will report to Tom Whelan, the firm's chief executive of global equities.

<P> Ricciardelli was formerly president and CEO of BPB Associates, a consulting
firm specialising in financial services infrastructure. He will be joined at
NatWest Markets by Thomas Fisher, executive vice president of operations, and
Seth Weinstein, executive vice president of technology, both colleagues from BPB
associates.

<P> <B>Kleinwort Benson Securities</B> has hired Charterhouse Tilney's three-man
UK retail team. The three are Robert Miller, Rod Salmon and Scott Ransley. The
team was ranked ninth in the 1996 Extel survey and third in the Reuters smaller
company survey.

<P> Peter Wann has joined <B>NatWest Securities</B> as associate director, where
will be responsible for servicing US equity fund managers at European
institutions as an economist and quantitative analyst. He will report to Peter
Horsburgh. Prior to joining NatWest Markets Wann spent 18 years at PaineWebber.




<P> <B>ING BSK Asset Management</B> has become the first licensed portfolio
manager in Poland, obtaining a licence from the Polish Securities Commission to
offer discretionary portfolio management services. The company will offer a wide
range of tailor-made and standardised portfolio services to institutional clients
in Poland and abroad. The services will include current income, bond, blue chip
and balanced portfolios of Polish securities.

<P> ING BSK Asset Management was established this year as a joint venture between
ING Bank and Bank Slaski in Katowice. Bank Slaski is majority-owned by ING.

<P> <B>Gartmore Private Capital</B>, the unlisted investment management team
within Gartmore, has been integrated with <B>NatWest Ventures</B>, the private
equity arm of NatWest Group. The opportunity to integrate arose from the purchase
of Gartmore by NatWest Group in April this year, and the merger of the two
investment management businesses. The integrated operation will be known as
NatWest Ventures (NWV).

<P> The Gartmore Private Capital team will remain responsible for their existing
clients, as well as assuming additional responsibilities within NWV. NWV remains
part of the global asset management division of NatWest Markets.

<P> <B>Monument Derivatives Limited</B> and <B>Albert E Sharp</B> are currently
in discussions which, it is anticipated, will lead to the acquisition of the
research and bond broking business of <B>The London Bond Broking Company</B>
(LBB) by Monument. LBB has operated as a division of Albert E Sharp since it was
founded in July 1992.

<P> Graham Cox has joined the corporate trust and agency business at <B>Bankers
Trust</B> in London as a vice president in the relationship management group,
initially focusing on the agency products. Cox joins from JP Morgan. &#009;

<P> <B>ABN AMRO</B> has appointed Ton J de Boer as CEO of the ABN AMRO Asia
Pacific region in Singapore. De Boer moves from ABN AMRO Inc in Chicago where he
was Vice Chairman.

<P> In his new post de Boer will supervise ABN AMRO's "Asia 2000" strategy. The
strategy consists of investing an additional $1bn in the region by early next
century and doubling the staffing level to 6,000.

<H3>THE MOORGATE SAGA </H3>
<H2>Herbie's Colonial Convertible </H2>
<B>Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Hong Kong</B> <BR>
<BR>
It is kinda unrestful when a guy crashes off a 14-hour flight and high-tails
it for the comfort of the Mandarin and what does he find there but his message
light is flashing, voice mail for you, sir, two nuclear warheads are awaiting
collection at Kai Tak airport and seeing as space is limited will you kindly
come and sign for them? <BR>
<BR>
Mom, there must be some mistake, I never order anything more lethal here
than a large Auld Willie (the Spirit of Scotland) from the Captain's Bar,
but what bushes me is whether the mistake comes courtesy of Harvey Q. Schicklgruber
III.V, our new senior vice-president (strategy and tactics) who just happens
to be the bank's aged president's favorite grand nephew. <BR>
<BR>
Two days ago Harvey calls me to ask if Hong Kong is closer to head office
or to Moorgate, and if so, he wishes me to brush up on my Commercial Banking
101 which takes in bills of lading, and go see what happens to this consignment
out of mainland China he gets the bank to finance, it mostly consists of
two thousand sporting rifles made for local hunters in the panda season,
so maybe the warheads are part of this. <BR>
<BR>
Such deals are no part of the administration's strategy and tactics back
in Washington, where they just voted China to be most favored nation but
only 3% more favoured than Iraq, with Cuba a close third, what with range
finding in the Taiwan Strait and helping themselves to US copyright material
the Chinese do not play well in the Beltway, and besides, their notions
of the rights of man are not those of Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson.
<BR>
<BR>
None of this fazes Harvey, tho' he tells me China is the world economy's
great hope, if every Chinaman can be persuaded to buy pants with turn-ups
on them it is goodbye recession for ever, Harvey says, I figure some snake-oil
merchant gets to him as a trustee of our retirement fund and my pension
now depends on the performance of Tibetan Extra Income, and as for human
rights, Harvey's family never cares too much for them. <BR>
<BR>
Of course we have our own resident snake-oil merchant here in Holey Buckett,
Herbie, he says, try your luck in Hong Kong, we can always use another fund
with decent front end loading, I am thinking of a Hong Kong Colonial Convertible
with the right to switch into Greater China Hyper-Growth next year, maybe
Jardine Fleming can help you with this, if they are not too busy just now.
<BR>
<BR>
Well, here is something else for me to do in Hong Kong, as if I need it,
as well as having shirts made and attending the races and eating power lunches
at the China Club, see and be seen, morning, Tango, morning, Herbie, and
I sure cannot spare the time to tunnel my way out to Kai Tak and avert World
War III, not even if I ride in the Mandarin's superior Rolls Royce and charge
it. <BR>
<BR>
So I call the agent who calls and leaves a message on his voice mail, stalling
him, and scoot out to pick up the scuttlebutt which in this town has zeros
on it, boy, do the big shots have it in for this British colonial governor,
they complain how whenever he opens his mouth it riles the Chinese and they
lose another order, why cannot he just parade around in a plumed hat and
lay foundation stones until the Queen sends her yacht along to pick him
up and take him home? <BR>
<BR>
I tell these guys how we have a similar problem with a British governor
some time ago, in Boston, Mass., and do they yet throw China tea into the
harbor, apparently someone does try this but all that happens is the harbor
catches fire, and besides when I ask what it is this governor says that
so annoys them, it sounds as if someone tells him about Jefferson and Paine.
<BR>
<BR>
Still, maybe his difficulty is our opportunity, and maybe Harvey's strategy
works out, stranger things do happen, Hong Kong has an open door policy
for banks so if we move in and sit quiet for 400 days we find ourselves
grandfathered right into China, and can lend to all the tailors to finance
the extra cloth they need for making pants with turnups, and our fortune
is made. <BR>
<BR>
All I need now is the go ahead from Harvey and another from the neat new
Monetary Authority they have here as tenants of Citibank, but I never get
the chance to call them, back at the hotel my phone is already ringing,
our agent again, now he says they evacuate the freight hall at Kai Tak and
business there is at a standstill, which is the worst thing that can ever
happen in Hong Kong, someone complains that our warheads are ticking. <BR>
<BR>
Well, what am I to do, I tell the guy to have another look at them and see
if he can find a switch and if so turn it off, but if not he is to leave
all the documentation at ground zero, or at least any paper with our name
in it, by way of precaution, while I put a person-to-person call thru to
Harvey and ask him what we do with the sporting guns. <BR>
<BR>
Harvey is not a happy bunny when he gets the call, he wishes to know if
I know what time it is at this time, and as for the warheads, they are no
more than display models for a trade exhibition, called Nuke-a-Neighbor,
just like it says in the bill of lading, tho' I recall enough from Commercial
Banking 101 to know how bills of lading do not always tell the truth. <BR>
<BR>
By now he learns this too, he explains to me how there is some other mistake
about the sporting guns, they are on the way to a consortium of olive oil
importers in Chicago when the FBI busts them, and agents come round to head
office and start asking questions and tip off the blatts, happily the Tombstone
Epitaph is a customer of ours and owes us money, but elsewhere the coverage
is unhelpful. <BR>
<BR>
I ask Harvey what he does about this and he tells me he fires the head of
corporate affairs, poor guy, still, better him than me, but I guess our
new tactics and strategy are to lay off the China play for just a while,
much love from <BR>
<BR>

<H2>Way to go</H2>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Privatization has got itself a bad name. Investors, burned by poorly-performing issues over the past two years, are no longer excited by it. Most European governments have botched their privatization programmes by being too greedy and wanting to raise cash quickly. The British have run out of things to sell. In many developing countries, privatization is tainted with corruption. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The received wisdom of the moment is that privatization worldwide has reached the end of the line. But received wisdom is wrong. The wave of privatization, which started in 1984 with the sale of British Telecom, has only just begun. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Take the figures for the share of the public sector in GDP.  In the US, according to the World Bank, state companies represent only 0.6% of GDP and in the UK 1.9%. It's a fair bet that most developed countries, over time, will tend to move towards those levels. But look how far they still have to go. The World Bank's statistics (published in October) are not as recent or accurate as might be desired. But they give an indication of the respective size of countries' state sectors. They show that the state sector in France (excluding banks and insurance companies, themselves a large chunk) equalled 10% of GDP, in Austria 13.9%, in Germany 6.4% and in Portugal 14.2%. In emerging markets, the public sector tends to be even larger: 13.3% in South Africa, 10.2% in Korea, 8.4% in Mexico, for example. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This leads David Roche, president of research firm Independent Strategy and a columnist in <I>Euromoney, </I>to predict that $6 trillion of privatization assets will be sold over the next 20 years, including $3 trillion in eastern Europe and China combined. The pace in the past five years, he says, has been slow in comparison to what is about to come. What happens when (or, perhaps, if) China starts to sell a substantial portion of its state assets? 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The success of privatization to date is also, in our view, incontrovertible. Almost every study of UK privatization during the 1980s has shown that privatized companies display significant improvements in efficiency, particularly when competition is introduced, but even when it is not. To quote the conclusions of one recent report (<I>Privatization and Economic Performance </I>by Matthew Bishop, John Kay and Colin Mayer): "Productivity measures such as labour productivity ... and total factor productivity ... rose sharply when measured against the same firms' performance during the 1970s."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Anecdotal evidence points to the same conclusion. Before privatization, British Telecom, then a division of the General Post Office, had 250,000 customers waiting to have a telephone installed. Now lines are generally installed within two days. Costs to British consumers of all utilities have fallen substantially in real terms since the companies were privatized.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The effect on the UK's finances has also been highly beneficial. Since 1979, 48 major businesses have been transferred to the private sector, bringing in proceeds of &#163;65 billion ($96 billion). Back in 1981, state-owned companies cost British taxpayers &#163;50 million a week in subsidies; the same firms now contribute &#163;55 million a week to the treasury in taxes.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The potential benefits for developing countries are even higher. There, state-owned companies tend to be even worse-run than those in the west. In Bangladesh, for example, state companies use about one-fifth of credit, but account for only 3% of the country's output. The World Bank quotes the example of Turkish coal mining company, Turkiye Taskomuru Kurumu, whose losses in 1992 equalled about $12,000 per worker, six times the average national income. Yet safety conditions in the mine were so poor that the miners' life expectancy was only 46 - 11 years less than the national average. "The miners and the government would have been better off if the government had imported coal and paid the miners to stay home," comments the World Bank in a recent report <I>Bureaucrats in Business</I>.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite this, the poorer countries have not generally followed the trend towards privatization. The World Bank estimates that state-owned companies' share of developing market economies has remained at about 11% since 1980, during which period it fell in industrial countries from 9% to 7%. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is set to change. The parlous state of many countries' national budgets leaves them little choice but to sell state assets. The majority of developing countries will also need a strong privatization programme as a prerequisite for economic growth in the years ahead.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One warning for such countries: if you're going to privatize, do it thoroughly. Companies nominally in the private sector but in practice controlled by governments - as many in France, Japan and developing countries are - are usually even less efficient than pure public-sector firms. They face the constraints of the market, without reaping its benefits, such as the freedom to act as they want. Privatization carried out just to raise money - not based on a broad vision of how the economy should work - is a recipe for failure.<p>

<H3>NEW ZEALAND</H3>

<H3> <B>On the road to a no-debt policy</B> </H3> 
<H4> <B>The New Zealand
government is withdrawing from the debt market &#173; it plans to have zero net
foreign debt by the end of this year. Opportunities for foreign investors are
therefore focusing on newly privatized companies, government-owned commercial
corporations and even some yet to be deregulated industries. By Albert Smith</B>
</H4> 

<P> Robust economic management, aimed at reducing government engagement in
the economy and lowering government debt, has made New Zealand's participation in
international money markets a rare event.

<P> The government's long-term strategy of avoiding debt as a way of financing
government activities and actively retiring existing obligations as fast as
possible has significant implications for the markets.

<P> This debt policy &#173; actually a non-debt policy &#173; will inevitably
lead to smaller and smaller issues of new government paper. It means that fund
managers needing this kind of New Zealand security could well have to buy on the
open market to fill out portfolios.

<P> Given the current yield on government bonds (about 8%) and the probability of
rates in New Zealand declining, as forecast by Bankers Trust New Zealand among
others, fund managers could well interpret the impending scarcity of new
government paper as a "buy now" signal.

<P> While the government has been unloading its own debt, its policies have also
brought a number of new players into the market. Its strategic disengagement from
business activities by selling off enterprises has created a group of
non-government but nevertheless favourably rated issuers.

<P> Although these do not fill the gap left by the progressive withdrawal of the
government from the  money markets, they have been quite active in both domestic
and overseas markets, and seem likely to continue being so.

<P> Many of the government's sales of commercial activities have been to
investors, but others have been sold to government-owned corporations that are
required to carry on business at arm's length from the government and to trade on
the same commercial basis as private enterprises.

<P> These relatively new issuers in the capital markets are just one outcome of a
process of economic reform that has been going on for 12 years. From a country
that was on the verge of financial collapse in 1984, New Zealand has emerged,
after a long period of painful reform, as one of the world's most open and
strongest economies. Its open-door policy has made it one of the most assured
avenues of international investment.

<P> Major foreign investors have directly purchased government business
enterprises, such as banks, power companies and telecommunications but the
equity, bond and capital markets are also attracting international interest.

<P> Although New Zealand suffers from all the inherent difficulties of a small
market &#173; its population is just below 4 million &#173; it has attracted
strong investment inflows in the past three years. In 1992 it had a net outflow
of portfolio investment of NZ$396 million ($274.58 million), but by 1993 the tide
had turned, with foreign portfolio investment rising to NZ$1.087 billion and
surging to NZ$5.645 billion in 1994 .

<P> <B>Direct foreign investment</B>

<P> Direct foreign investment in New Zealand assets has also grown fast. In 1992
direct net foreign investment totalled NZ$2.026 billion, rising to NZ$4.405
billion in 1993 and NZ$4.449 billion in 1994. By May this year 51.6% of New
Zealand government <BR> securities, totalling NZ$14.148 billion, were held by
non-residents.

<P> The rising value of New Zealand's currency has undoubtedly been a factor in
the overseas appetite for paper denominated in New Zealand dollars. The
Commonwealth Bank of Australia had led two issues on the New Zealand market, one
of NZ$50 million for itself and another for NZ$100 million for the World Bank.

<P> Clearly offshore investors like what they see in New Zealand's economic
management and the reform process begun in 1984 by then minister of finance Roger
Douglas (now Sir Roger Douglas) and pursued and amplified by successive
governments. Faced with a financial crisis in 1984, Douglas responded by
initiating the deregulation of the financial sector and floating the New Zealand
currency.

<P> The Labour Party initially followed the Douglas line but, after being
re-elected in 1987, lost its appetite for reform, forcing Douglas to resign in
1988. The government proved itself unwilling to tackle labour market reform and
to restrain the expansion of government services. In 1990 the National Party
gained power and pursued areas left untouched by the previous government, but
immediately ran into the 1991 recession.

<P> The road for economic reformers has never been smooth, and the dividends from
the New Zealand reforms were relatively slow in arriving. Many New Zealanders,
raised in a protectionist, cosseted, subsidized and regulated society, suffered
considerable pain as the government proceeded to strip away these supports.

<P> The reform process is by no means complete: New Zealanders still have to
blunt their appetite for income and welfare support. In 1995 income support
absorbed 11.5% of GDP, compared with 11.3% in 1985: in 10 years there has been
virtually no progress. But the biggest threat to the pursuit of further reforms
is the new electoral system, which seems likely  always to elect minority
governments, with small populist and single-issue parties holding the balance of
power.

<P> For the time being, however, the pain has brought considerable gain.
Unemployment, which touched 10.9% in September 1991, had fallen to 6.2% by March
1996. Since March 1993 employment has grown by 13%. The fall in unemployment,
coupled with a rise in employment, points to a high level of new job creation and
a higher rate of participation by the workforce.

<P> <B>Running down domestic debt</B>

<P> A significant statistic is the continuing growth in the government's fiscal
surplus: NZ$765 million in the financial year 1993-94; NZ$2.695 billion in
1994-95; NZ$2.929 billion in 1995-96; and projected to reach NZ$4.92 billion in
1998-99, assuming the continuation of present policies. The government's success
in reducing its expenditure is shown by the fall from 41.2% of GDP in 1992-93 to
35.2% in 1995-96.

<P> With the proposed sale of some of its forest interests, by the end of this
calendar year the government will have zero net foreign debt. It proposes then to
apply any returns from asset sales and its own surplus funds to the redemption of
domestic debt.

<P> An important part of the government's economic management is control of
inflation and it has charged the Reserve Bank with this task. Murray Sherwin,
deputy governor of the bank, says: "Our focus is obviously on inflation, and we
have some uncomfortable pressures coming through over the next couple of
quarters: our underlying inflation rate projected to peak at 2.6% for the year to
September. "Our target is zero to 2%, so we are outside that, which is a matter
of some discomfort."

<P> A 2.6% inflation outcome would be satisfactory in most economies and Sherwin
concedes that New Zealand's targeting has been formidable. "We set ourselves a
deliberately ambitious target and it has been effective in anchoring inflationary
expectations. But it is tough &#173; particularly when you are five or so years
into what has been a strong recovery." Shirwin believes the problem areas where
price pressures threaten to overshoot the inflation targets are goods and
services not subject to international competition, and the rising price of
residential and rural real estate.

<P> And it is in residential real estate that one of the corporatized entities,
Housing New Zealand Ltd, operates. Housing New Zealand is one of the relatively
new boys on the capital market block: it was established in 1992 to own and
manage the government housing portfolio and is New Zealand's biggest landlord,
leasing 67,000 homes to low-income tenants.

<P> During the past year the company has restructured its balance sheet by
repaying NZ$600 million to its shareholders in the form of a share buy-back. This
was facilitated by a valuation which lifted the value of its property assets from
NZ$2.6 billion to NZ$4.7 billion. The company has transitional debt to the
government of about NZ$1.9 billion and Peter Garty, general manager finance, has
put together a borrowing programme to refinance this debt.

<P> On April 4, the company issued a prospectus for a cocktail issue of various
kinds of bonds of varying maturities which are open to negotiation in order to
raise a maximum of NZ$1.5 billion. Joint lead managers are CS First Boston and
the National Bank of New Zealand. Bankers Trust New Zealand is co-manager.

<P> The company has a rating of A-1 for short-term debt and a rating of A+ for
long-term debt from Standard and Poor's (S&amp;P), and Peter Garty expects a
favourable rating soon from Moody's.

<P> With Deutsche Bank as lead manager, Housing New Zealand is also preparing an
issue for the European transferable note market, but the timing of this has not
yet been decided.

<P> Deregulation of industries has produced many success stories for New Zealand,
but one of the enterprises that is still regulated &#173; the New Zealand Dairy
Board &#173; has been more successful than most. The board handles all of the
country's export dairy products, which account for 18% of all exports. It has
successfully penetrated markets all over the world and the success of dairying is
one of the reasons for the rural land property price boom.

<P> Mike Clarke, the dairy board's capital markets manager, has an unusual
financing task, having to issue mainly short-term paper over 30, 60 and 90 days.
This hits a peak of NZ$1.2 billion after the spring and summer production
periods, falling to a low of usually NZ$300 million in the late winter months.
This capital raising provides working funds for the acquisition of butter and
cream products, milk powder and other products from dairy cooperatives and
factories. The New Zealand Dairy Board covers these borrowings with stand-by
facilities and by hedging since it has large foreign currency earnings.

<P> To handle its financing task, it has satellite treasuries in Reigate, near
London, and another in Singapore, and uses nine dealers on the European market,
12 handling global commercial paper and two dealing in US commercial paper. The
board's longer-term borrowings are smallish, amounting to NZ$250 million and
maturing in 1999.

<P> The rating agencies seem to approve the board's conservative financing
arrangements. Standard and Poor's rates its short-term debt at A1+ and long-term
debt at AA minus. Moody's rating is similar: A1 for short-term debt and AA2 for
longer-term debt.

<P> An equally high-rated issuer is national electricity grid company Trans Power
which is rated AA+ by S&amp;P and Aa1 by Moody's. Trans Power is one of the
larger government-owned companies, with assets of NZ$53 billion and annual
revenue of NZ$550 million.

<P> Trans Power treasurer Graham Turley supervises a borrowing programme to
finance expansion and to replace existing debt. Since April last year Trans Power
has had eight domestic issues and 10 in Europe, including two Swfr100 million
($82.4 million) note issues.

<P> If &#173; as seems likely &#173; the New Zealand government continues to
pursue its policy of running down its borrowings, offshore investors who wish to
profit from a strong New Zealand currency will have to look to issues of the kind
offered by Trans Power from time to time.

<H2> <B>Getting the banking reform balance right</B> </H2> <P> The new
deregulated banking supervision process in New Zealand has gained qualified
approval from the industry, but there are still hurdles for it to cross.

<P> The regime, which came into force on January 1, requires banks to make
quarterly disclosures of key financial data, to display summaries of this data in
all bank branches and to publish comprehensive financial reports for
shareholders, analysts and the financial press.

<P> It also imposes on directors the responsibility of ensuring that banks comply
with the conditions of their registration, adequately monitor and control risks,
and ensure that exposure to controlling shareholders is not contrary to the
interests of banks. Finally, the directors have to attest that the quarterly
disclosures are not false or misleading. Penalties for breaches could be quite
severe.

<P> The disclosures required of the banks are similar to those required for
half-year reports but include such things as credit ratings, capital ratios, and
information on exposure concentration, asset quality, shareholders' guarantees
and profitability.

<P> Initially, the banks made their quarterly disclosures in private to the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand, but for the June quarter the disclosures went
public. Peter J Ledingham, the Reserve Bank's chief manager banking systems, says
the new regime has worked well, with any teething problems being sorted out
between the Reserve Bank and the banks concerned. One breach by the National
Bank, a subsidiary of Lloyds Bank, hit the headlines in New Zealand but was soon
resolved. A side-effect noticed by Ledingham has been that bank directors are
better informed than before.

<P> For the September quarter, the Reserve Bank will require disclosure of
exposure to market risk, but this requirement, always intended to be part of the
disclosure regime, is causing disquiet in the banking community. Executive
director of the New Zealand Bankers' Association Simon Carlaw thinks there is a
risk that commercial confidentiality will be broken by this requirement. His view
is that in the small New Zealand market, astute observers of the data will be
able to work out who is borrowing what from whom.

<P> Another problem for Carlaw is the inherent conflict between the disclosure
rules of the Reserve Bank and the company reporting standards for all public
companies &#173; including banks &#173; which come into force in 1997. Carlaw
says the accounting rules, which will have the force of law, do not harmonize
with the Reserve Bank rules. Banks will be at a disadvantage in being required to
comply with two sets of regulations, the requirements of which will not satisfy
the demands of the other authority. He says the outstanding task for the 
industry is to get the two sets of regulations working in tandem.

<HTML> <HEAD><TITLE>BELGIAN BANK MERGERS</TITLE></HEAD> <BODY>


<H3> <B>Has Narmon lit the touchpaper?</B> </H3> 
<H4> <B>Fran&ccedil;ois Narmon hopes to make Cr&eacute;dit Communal de Belgique one of the world's largest
lenders to municipalities, merging with France's Cr&eacute;dit Local to that end.
But the actions of Belgium's second-biggest bank could trigger another Belgian
merger. The key is Cr&eacute;dit Communal's shareholding in Banque Bruxelles
Lambert. Steven Irvine reports</B> </H4> 

<P> It has been a very productive summer
for Fran&ccedil;ois Narmon. Not only has the chief executive of Cr&eacute;dit
Communal de Belgique signed an agreement with Cr&eacute;dit Local de France to
create a European banking powerhouse. Symbolically, the 62-year-old banker's
second wife also gave birth to twins the month before the negotiations were
concluded.

<P> Only six months before the July 9 signing, the athletically built Narmon had
informed the six-person management board of his ambitious intentions &#173; to
make Cr&eacute;dit Communal not just a Belgian but a world leader in lending to
local authorities. Narmon, who was given the title of Baron two years ago, and is
described by his colleagues and rivals as "a man of vision", has spent his entire
career at Cr&eacute;dit Communal, has been in charge of it for 17 years and is
viewed in Belgium as practically the embodiment of the bank. In fact, his
grandfather was an abandoned baby who was found on the site of Cr&eacute;dit
Communal's Boulevard Pachecho headquarters &#173; which at the time was a
hospital.

<P> So the alliance in July of Belgium's second-biggest bank (by assets) and the
twelfth-largest bank in France was seen as a very personal one, forged by Narmon
and Cr&eacute;dit Local's chairman, Pierre Richard. The two men regularly chatted
about a product merger when the Belgian &#173; a Cr&eacute;dit Local board member
for eight years &#173; was in Paris for board meetings.

<P> Why the desire to merge? In spite of the 22% growth in profits last year,
Communal was aware that its credit rating was under review. It did not have an
international strategy and European monetary union looks certain to increase
competition in its home market where it has a 99% market share &#173; not least
from Cr&eacute;dit Local.

<P> Cr&eacute;dit Local, which has about half the French market in local
authority lending, and has recently diversified with great success into the UK,
Germany, Scandinavia and Spain, is also a very good fit &#173; nearly identical
in size. The two banks hope to pool their resources &#173; Communal's 970
branches in Belgium and Local's borrowing expertise in the international capital
markets &#173; to expand into the US and eastern Europe.

<P> The idea began to take a more serious turn about a year ago at an informal
dinner in Brussels. Val&eacute;re Croes, vice-chairman of Belgo-Dutch
insurance-to-banking conglomerate Fortis, recalls that Narmon spent "75% of the
meal" asking him how to structure a cross-border European merger of equals. This
was exactly what Fortis did when it invented a revolutionary holding company
structure six years ago, to merge AMEV, a Dutch insurer, with AG, a Belgian
insurer.

<P> The Fortis structure has been duplicated in this Belgian-French merger. Each
holding company owns 50% of each bank in a cross-holding under which the
individual boards are retained and a joint management committee is created.

<P> Soon after the deal was signed (shareholders are likely to approve it in
October), Narmon jetted off to Atlanta to watch the Olympic Games, where
Cr&eacute;dit Communal continues its sponsorship of the Belgian national team.

<P> It is a suitable sponsorship for a bank which is more closely associated with
Belgian national interests than most. So much so that at first glance it appears
surprising that Narmon chose to carry out a cross-border merger rather than
participate in a much-needed consolidation in Belgium itself.

<P> In fact up until January, despite the clear strategic advantages of the
cross-border option, he appeared more interested in forging a domestic alliance.
At the beginning of the year he commented that he saw the need for "a bigger
Belgian bank". His remark sparked a wave of merger fever during which the share
price of Belgium's third-largest bank (by assets), Banque Bruxelles Lambert
(BBL), was forced up 5% in one day.

<P> Cr&eacute;dit Communal owns just over 12% of BBL, which is viewed as the most
vulnerable of Belgium's banks. BBL's share price had been the subject of
speculation ever since last August when its 65-year-old chairman, Daniel Cardon
de Lichtbuer, admitted that he would like to create a large Belgian alliance
before he retired in 1996.

<P> <B>U-turn on consolidation</B>

<P> Likewise, Belgian minister of finance Philippe Maystadt (a member of the same
political grouping as Cardon &#173; both are French-speaking Christian Democrats)
said in January that he agreed with Cardon's vision. Elio di Rupo, the deputy
prime minister, went further and advocated a Belgian merger, saying that under
monetary union, "competition will become stronger, and Belgian banks will lose
the protection and supremacy that the Belgian franc currently gives them on their
national market". This was something of a government U-turn. In the past it had
discouraged large banking mergers in an effort to fight unemployment, threatening
to boost taxes on bank profits if they resulted from large layoffs.

<P> The Belgian government is now concerned that its banking industry will suffer
the same fate as its steel industry. It has pointed out, with some alarm, that
the balance sheet of the largest Dutch bank is equal in size to a combination of
five of Belgium's largest seven banks (known locally as the G-7 or great seven).
"It's interesting to compare the Dutch and Belgian models," comments Georges
Ugeux, head of the privatization commission. "They consolidated much earlier.
This is a major achievement for Holland, which is not much different to Belgium."

<P> It was tentatively suggested in January that Cr&eacute;dit Communal might
join with BBL and G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Banque. BBL and
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Banque alone would create one of the world's top 20
banks, with assets of $300 billion. The speculation came to nothing and Narmon
looked further afield. The suspicion was that Cr&eacute;dit Communal was too
public-sector in style for the liking of the other two.

<P> In spite of all the merger talk, it is not immediately apparent that a
<I>grande banque belge</I> is needed. Belgium's banking system benefits from one
of the world's highest savings ratios. Its major banks make money. Even BBL
enjoyed a 15% jump in its profits in 1995 to Bfr8.94 billion ($294 million).

<P> But the problem is European monetary union. And ironically, the
Brussels-driven project &#173; <I>when</I> it happens &#173; is certain to hit
the Brussels-based banks harder than most. Guido Ravoet, director general of the
Belgian Bankers Association, points out that putting in place the infrastructure
to cope with the euro will cost 7.5% of Belgian banks' profits over four years,
at a conservative estimate.

<P> The banks will also lose foreign exchange commissions. The Belgium Bankers
Association calculates this will cost the banks 10% of their profits each year.
Then, of course, there will be increased competition in the domestic loan market
once the currency risk is removed for banks in the euro bloc.

<P> The demise of the currency union with Luxembourg &#173; in favour of a larger
currency union &#173; will also hurt the Belgian banks (and the Belgian
treasury). Currently, a large part of Luxembourg banks' surplus cash is invested
in short-term Belgian interbank deposits and short-term treasury bills. This is a
particularly cost-effective source of funding for the banks. There is no currency
risk on these instruments &#173; the key attraction for the Luxembourg banks.
But, post-euro, they might move these cost-effective deposits anywhere in the
currency bloc.

<P> But most important of all is what one Belgian banker referred to as the low
quality of the profits the big banks have earned in recent years. About a third
of profits arose from trading activity, principally in the government bond
market. The Belgian banks hold 49.6% of outstanding government bonds (OLOs) and,
in secondary trading, the primary dealers represent 51% of all activity, with the
larger Belgian banks accounting for "the lion's share", according to the Belgian
treasury. The result is that the so called G-3 &#173; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de
Banque, Kredietbank and BBL &#173; have all made substantial sums in proprietary
trading. Their very presence in a large trade can move the market in
self-fulfilling fashion. The interest-rate environment has been favourable too.

<P> Post-euro, this advantage will be gradually eroded by competition from
abroad, with a more open Belgian government bond market.

<P> All of which explains why calls for mergers between the 80 or so banks in the
overbanked high streets of Leuven, Antwerp and Brussels have dramatically
increased. But although everyone knows it makes sense, putting mergers into
practice is not such a simple proposition. This is partly because of the
formidable intra-regional politics in Belgium. There are divisions that
proliferate along linguistic lines (French- or Flemish-speaking), religious
grounds (Catholic or non-Catholic) and those of ideology (socialist or liberal).
And banking loyalties are entrenched in all of these.

<P> Amid the talk of merging G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Banque, BBL and
Cr&eacute;dit Communal, a key voice of dissent was Flemish minister-president Luc
Van den Brande &#173; a sort of Belgian  Newt Gingrich, for whom the words
"Flemish interests" should be substituted for "budget deficits". He objected to
Gemeentekrediet (the Flemish name for Cr&eacute;dit Communal) falling into the
hands of French-speaking interests because G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Banque is
controlled by Suez in Paris, while BBL is more closely associated with Belgium's
southern French-speaking state of Wallonia. Cr&eacute;dit
Communal/Gemeentekrediet is nearly 50% owned by Belgium's northern federal state,
Flanders.

<P> It is questionable how important this intervention was. But the failure of
the domestic merger was the immediate catalyst for Narmon to hook up with
Cr&eacute;dit Local &#173; a subject upon which Van den Brande has remained
strangely silent despite the obvious French connection. His silence is surely a
mark of how perfect a merger it must be. And yet perhaps more interesting is the
short-term impact of what Communal's Narmon will do at home.

<P> The direct result of the merger does not lessen the possibility of the
<I>grande banque belge </I>happening. Paradoxically it increases the possibility
of a large domestic merger because Cr&eacute;dit Communal still has its 12.52%
block of shares in BBL.

<P> Narmon &#173; who in the 1980s taught accountancy each morning at the Free
University of Brussels before going to the office, and is said to speak French
with a Flemish accent and Flemish with a French accent &#173; may hold the key to
its future. Last August he allied with Albert Fr&egrave;re of Groupe Bruxelles
Lambert (GBL) and Royal Belge to form a shareholder control committee, which has
since used its 37.3% stake to run BBL. This so-called French-speaking bloc
outvotes ING Bank of Holland, BBL's single-largest shareholder.

<P> ING tried to take over BBL in 1993. But the Dutch bank and insurance
conglomerate lowered its offer at the last minute to Bfr3,100 per share from
Bfr3,600. This provoked speculation, which proved unfounded, that ING's team of
corporate financiers had found skeletons in BBL's loan book. BBL's current share
price stands at around Bfr5,750, having reached a high of Bfr6,200 earlier this
year.

<P> <B>Uncompetitive shareholders</B>

<P> The shareholder control committee was formed hot on the heels of ING's move
to increase its 12.32% stake last year. It accumulated another 6.73% (of voting
rights) through a special loan made to Italy's Lefebvre d'Ovidio family &#173;
which effectively gives it an option on the shares until 1998. This took its
total stake up to 20%, which means ING can consolidate BBL's figures in its group
accounts.

<P> However, events took an unexpected twist in February when EU commissioner
Karel Van Miert sent a letter to the members of the French-speaking shareholder
control group asking them to abandon the pact because it was uncompetitive under
Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome. The Flemish-born commissioner noted that to
have a high street competitor (Cr&eacute;dit Communal) steering the management of
BBL was not good for the latter. By April, Van Miert was still not satisfied with
the four-page reply sent by the control group, which included examples of
occasions when BBL had done things not necessarily in the interests of
Cr&eacute;dit Communal &#173; proof that Communal was not a malign influence. A
meeting between the parties concerned has been scheduled for September.

<P> A spokesman for the commissioner admits that he does not have the power to
force any of the parties to sell their shares. So there are four possible
outcomes. First, Van Miert could back down, although there is a slim chance of
this happening. Second, he could be persuaded they are right, via the verbal
presentation. Third, Van Miert could declare it uncompetitive and dissolve the
formal pact, a state of affairs that would not, however, prevent the three voting
together on key issues &#173; which would be a little embarrassing for the
commissioner. But perhaps the most likely outcome will be a voluntary sale in
response to a fear of those concerned about negative publicity. This is most
pertinent to Narmon of Cr&eacute;dit Communal. It would provide him with a timely
excuse to sell a shareholding which no longer has any strategic value since the
merger with Cr&eacute;dit Local. (The block was purchased sporadically in 1993 at
an average price of Bfr3,500 and so would realize a huge capital gain, with the
share price over Bfr2000 higher today.)

<P> <B>Management stresses</B>

<P> Narmon recently said he has no intention of selling. However, secretary to
the board and chief economist Eddy Plettinck told <I>Euromoney</I> that the stake
had become less strategic. "It would be difficult to proclaim the opposite," he
said. "But it still remains a good financial investment."

<P> Good portfolio investment or not, Communal, some suggest, would be better off
using the funds to invest in opportunities in eastern Europe &#173; one of the
key areas of expansion planned with Cr&eacute;dit Local. And, presumably,
Narmon's time will be at an even greater premium with the completion of the
French merger. Does he have time to be on another major bank's board? There are
certain to be complex management issues thrown up by the merger. This is because
the management of Cr&eacute;dit Communal and Cr&eacute;dit Local will only work
together on international projects without merging their domestic operations.
Val&eacute;re Croes, the vice-chairman of Fortis, upon which the cross-border
merger model is based, says: "If they are not putting in place one management
board, then the structure is weak. If the strategy is, France is France and
Belgium is Belgium, then I can guarantee that is a very weak solution."

<P> The rumour in Brussels is also that Fr&egrave;re of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert,
the linchpin investor in BBL, will sell provided the price is right.
Fr&egrave;re, who lives in Charleroi, the same Wallonian town as minister of
finance Maystadt, may likewise view it as an opportune time to sell, especially
as the market has failed to build into the share price the possible negative
impact of monetary union.

<P> Who would buy? Most likely G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Banque or ING.

<P> G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Banque and BBL have already tried and failed to
merge. This was driven in January by G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Banque's main
shareholder, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Belgique, which is
controlled by Suez in Paris. The pipe-smoking boss of Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, Viscount Etienne Davignon, later said it was ING that
prevented the deal going ahead. It is assumed that ING  still wants BBL, although
ING's official line on the incident is that it was not prepared to be diluted as
this would hinder its ability to consolidate BBL into its accounts. According to
one source, however, accountants have ways around this problem.

<P> But an ING spokesperson says: "We are quite happy with the situation as it
is. Otherwise we do not comment on the Belgian banking area. We have elected to
keep a low profile." So much so that the spokesperson was unwilling, when asked,
even to reveal the name of the Lefebvre d'Ovidio family, whose voting rights ING
controls &#173; a mark of how seriously he takes not saying anything.

<P> Politically, ING has the backing of Van den Brande. Van den Brande likes to
point out that 60% of BBL's deposit base is derived from Flanders, which is
richer than the French-speaking southern federal state of Wallonia. A strongly
worded statement he wrote earlier this year noted: "In the current merger
debates, it is remarkable that banks belonging to financial groups whose decision
centres lie in Paris (Suez, UAP [an insurer], Cr&eacute;dit Local de France) pose
as Belgian, while a Benelux bank such as ING is considered to be foreign."

<P> The question is not whether ING has the political muscle, but whether it can
stomach paying such a high price for BBL, bearing in mind the downward revision
in its offer the last time it made a bid for the bank. Two recent court cases in
Belgium supported the rights of minority shareholders, signalling that any bid
would have to be for 100% of shares and not just for a block of shares purchased
at a premium to the stock price.

<P> A Brussels source says that the Banking Commission recently rejected a plan
to bring ING into the BBL control committee. Under this plan GBL, Royale Belge
and Cr&eacute;dit Communal would offer ING options on their shares over a given
period, thus diluting themselves gradually. The Banking Commission refused the
plan, on the grounds that it would give ING control through the back door.

<P> Another view is that ING does not want majority control. If this is the case
and should ING simply want a blocking minority of BBL stock, then under EU law,
it would have to purchase 33%; although under Belgian law, a blocking minority is
only 25%.

<P> Suez, meanwhile, continues to manoeuvre from Paris. Its Belgian subsidiary,
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Belgique, recently organized a
credit line through G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Banque of Bfr20 billion. On top of
the Bfr20 billion of cash it already has, this is a sizeable war chest ($1.3
billion). Brussels bankers say it has one of two purposes. The first is
BBL-related, the other might be to buy out Fr&egrave;re's 25% stake in Tractebel,
an important Belgian industrial company with holdings in electricity and gas.

<P> Whatever Paris wants, it is not altogether clear that G&eacute;n&eacute;rale
de Banque's boss, Ferdinand<B> </B>Chaffart, or his senior layer of management,
are altogether in agreement. He made it plain in January he was not so keen on
the BBL marriage. His strategy is to create a super-regional bank working through
organic growth and acquisition, operating in a 400-kilometre radius of Brussels.
He is looking for acquisitions in London and Germany, having already purchased
Banque Parisienne de Cr&eacute;dit and Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais Holland. Chaffart,
who is not from a banking background and spent much of his career working in the
cement industry, believes a merger with BBL will cause so many job losses &#173;
one estimate runs to 5,000 &#173; that it will create political problems. He
thinks the upshot is that Kredietbank would be the biggest winner, gaining a lot
of disaffected clients at no cost.

<P> <B>Obsession with control</B>

<P> Eric De Keuleneer, formerly head of corporate finance at
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Banque and now head of yet to be privatized government
mortgage bank Office Centrale de Cr&eacute;dit Hypoth&eacute;caire, is vocal on
the subject of bank ownership: "BBL has got some shareholders who would like to
sell. In most industrial companies these blocks of shares would be sold in the
market. In Belgium we have had, for a number of years, a particular weakness
whereby many people are led to believe that each company needs a controlling
shareholder." He adds that most successful banks in other countries have no such
controlling shareholder and do not seem to suffer for it.

<P> He would like to see more debate on this subject within Belgium: "If BBL
could have a more stable, widespread shareholder base which respects its
autonomy, it would be more profitable. Then, if it needed to, it could
participate in joint ventures or mergers in the best interests of the bank &#173;
instead of being pushed here and there in the interests of a controlling
shareholder."

<P> Merger talk is less common at Flemish-controlled Kredietbank, which stands
out as a pillar of independence. With the best return on equity among the large
banks at just over 13%, it is controlled by Almany, a Flemish holding company
which has access to a poison pill in the event of a takeover.

<P> Its strategy is a simple one: to buy small savings banks in Flanders, such as
the purchase earlier this year of Bank van Roeselaere for Bfr9 billion, and
become a super-Flemish bank. The only merger suggestion it does not scoff at is
with sixth-ranked bank CERA, which is a Flemish farmers' bank, equally committed
to serving the six million people of Flanders.

<P> The other major player is Fortis, which owns CGER-ASLK, and recently absorbed
another government bank, SNCI, an industrial lender. It expects the latter
acquisition to absorb its time until 1997, but as Val&eacute;re Croes,
vice-chairman of Fortis, admits, he receives calls each week with new offers. One
of Fortis's board members is Etienne Davignon, head of Suez's
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de Belgique.

<P> The only other member of the G-7 so far not mentioned is Bacob. As a trade
union bank, it is ideologically opposed to mergers that might result in job
losses.

<H3>AGAINST THE TIDE </H3>
<H2>France: the failure of nationalism </H2>
<B>by David Roche</B> <BR>
<BR>
It was before the wave of strikes that hit France in December that I glided
into the Gare du Nord on one of France's ultra-smooth, ultra-expensive (to
the taxpayer, not the traveller) TGVs. I had two questions begging answers.
First, would the Franco-German axis in Europe hold? And second, would France
meet the Maastricht criteria for a European single currency by the end of
1997? <BR>
<BR>
As I sat in the TGV, I let my imagination run ahead to summer 1997. France
is still short of closing its budget deficit at Maastricht levels. There
is disorder in Paris and other major cities because unemployment is between
13% and 15%. President Chirac announces his fifth (predominantly tax-raising)
emergency budget. He feels increasingly like a dog chasing its own tail
and looks increasingly like one with its tail between its legs. The more
he raises taxes, the weaker the economy gets and the more radical support
grows for maintaining France's expensive social safety net. So the bigger
the deficit grows. <BR>
<BR>
Over in Germany, chancellor Kohl is approaching retirement. His last general
election will be in 1998 and he wants to go down in history as the man who
united Germany and then made it safe by uniting Europe too. So he and president
Chirac agree to abolish the exchange markets for their respective currencies
and peg the French franc to the Deutschmark at an irrevocable fixed-exchange
rate to preserve the Franco-German axis. <BR>
<BR>
Would that work? The answer is probably no. There are many reasons why a
Franco-German monetary union wouldn't wash. The concept of the state is
a good starting point. While Belgians expect nothing but austerity from
their government, the French still expect everything. That's why Chirac
won office - by promising higher wages and more jobs. <BR>
<BR>
Beneath this view of government lies a very different concept of capitalism
in Belgium and France. In this, as in foreign and defence policy, France
has sought to walk alone. Belgium, having no such nationalist pretensions,
can bear the relatively smaller cost of harmonizing its economy with Germany's.
To do the same, France would have to take much harder political decisions
which, so far, it has failed to do. <BR>
<BR>
They are harder because France has sought to create an independent economic
model of capitalism. It represents a strange mixture of shareholder and
state capitalism, with incestuous links to the state bureaucracy and the
<I>grandes &eacute;coles</I>. This model has failed in key areas like software
(Cap Gemini), computer technology (Machine Bull), defence (Dassault, A&eacute;rospatiale),
finance (Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais), telephony (Alcatel), water (Lyonnaise
des Eaux and G&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Eaux) and transport (Air France
and SNCF). <BR>
<BR>
Failure has occurred for several reasons. First, nationalism is the enemy
of global competitiveness when it comes to market size. Second, bureaucrats
generally make poor managers of free-market enterprises. And third, cosy
relations between the bureaucracy and the private sector help shield French
corporates from competitive pricing and hinder the efficient use of labour.
These failures of state capitalism dwarf the relative successes of the French
free-enterprise sector such as Carrefour, L'Or&eacute;al and Club Med. <BR>
<BR>
The French model has increased the sum of state indebtedness. The accumulated
losses and subsidies of many companies like SNCF and Air France rival the
announced deficits and debts of the social security system. The SNCF rail
company makes an annual loss of Ffr12 billion, it gets subsidies of Ffr55
billion and has debts (now Ffr175 billion) too. After the recent wave of
strikes, prime minister Alain Jupp&eacute; agreed to take up to one-fifth
of that debt off its books and cancelled the proposed restructuring of the
company. Similarly, Air France is about to get another Ffr20 billion from
the state. And then there's Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais with its Ffr130 billion
of bad loans being taken off its books by the government. Beside these huge
commitments, the social security deficit of Ffr64 billion that Jupp&eacute;
aims to eliminate is just high-profile peanuts. <I>Le mal fran&ccedil;ais
est plus grand et plus profond!</I> <BR>
<BR>
Unwinding all these hidden deficits means unwinding a way of life and changing
political philosophy to boot. Worse, it means big increases in short-term
unemployment. I think that France is still too wedded to the philosophy
of mind over market to make that change rapidly enough to meet the Maastricht
criteria. To be fair, the highly intelligent and skilled senior bureaucrats
I met in France swore that this change was under way. You must choose who
to believe. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Schizophrenic about Europe</B> <BR>
<BR>
So France could never go for a dual-currency regime with Germany. Unlike
a single European currency, it would entail abandoning the franc as the
<I>sole </I>national currency by giving the Deutschmark equivalent status.
That dilution of sovereignty would be political suicide for those who decreed
it. <BR>
<BR>
The Belgians would do it. There, ethnicity is common and nationalism rare.
Belgian support for Europe is unanimous among political parties and is by
consensus among its people. But France is deeply split on the issue. The
spirit of Gaullism is antithetical to the French design to limit German
power by cementing it into the architecture of the Maastricht treaty. About
Europe, Belgium is unanimous, France schizophrenic. <BR>
<BR>
The other problem for France is size. Belgium is a bankable problem for
Germany because it is so small. And a Belgian monetary peg with the Deutschmark
places the whole brunt of adjustment on Belgium, not on the Bundesbank,
because it is only the amount of foreign exchange reserves in Belgian hands
that will set money supply. And Belgium, unlike France, has a large current
account surplus to finance sufficient resources to hold a stable peg and
control money supply. <BR>
<BR>
France is unlikely to go so far as a monetary peg, and a politically fixed
exchange rate between the Deutschmark and French franc wouldn't work in
the same way as a peg. Absorbing a France that had failed to meet the Maastricht
treaty criteria could oblige the Bundesbank to absorb the franc ad infinitum.
That would boost German money supply as the Bundesbank issued Deutschmarks
for French francs. Alternatively, to sterilize the impact of the influx
of francs, the Bundesbank would have to sell short-term paper to absorb
excess liquidity, allowing real interest rates to rise. The Bundesbank would
never accept this economic risk. And chancellor Kohl, having forced German
monetary union down the Bundesbank's gullet, would not be able to do the
same for a half-baked monetary union with France. <BR>
<BR>
So, if a politically decreed monetary union is unlikely between France and
Germany, that brings us to our second question about France. Will France
meet the criteria? The answer is no. <BR>
<BR>
I believe that the government's task is much greater than it admits. First,
the starting deficits on the general government budget and the social security
account for the beginning of 1996 are likely to be higher than forecast
by the government. Second, the government is underestimating its debt servicing
costs in future years by 0.7% of GDP. And, third, an over-reliance on tax
increases and increased social charges to plug the deficits will depress
growth below government forecasts. <BR>
<BR>
Let us deal with each of these in turn. I reckon that France's social security
deficit will come in at over Ffr70 billion in 1995 compared with a government
estimate of Ffr64 billion. And there was probably an overshoot of about
Ffr10 billion on the 1995 budget deficit of Ffr322 billion. While the government
claims that, without reforms, the social security deficit would have been
Ffr61 billion in 1996, we think it would have been at least Ffr70 billion.
So we start from a total public sector deficit for 1995 of around Ffr400
billion, or 5.2% of GDP. That means the government has further to go than
it claims to meet the 3% target by the end of 1997. <BR>
<BR>
The government estimates that the cost of financing debt will decrease from
3.3% of GDP in 1995 to 2.7% of GDP in 1996. That's way too optimistic, even
if France grows at 2.8% in 1996, as the government forecasts. Based on my
interest-rate forecasts and faster rising debt than the government admits,
debt service costs will be more like 3.4% of GDP over the next two years.
That means that the government's target government deficit for 1996 and
1997 will not be met without more fiscal austerity. <BR>
<BR>
Finally, the new taxes and social charges will cut disposable income gains
to zero. The bitterly fought-over social security measures will add 1% of
GDP to the tax burden. And I don't think employment will rise by anything
like the government's forecast of between 1.25% and 1.5%. So, with unemployment
rising, the household savings rate will stay at 14%. All this makes the
government's forecast of 2.8% real growth in 1996 look like a pipedream.
I think it could be below 1%. Our glum view is substantiated by practically
every indicator for the French economy, except exports. They're all pointing
down, particularly consumer confidence. <BR>
<BR>
It's not as if France is doing nothing right. Deregulation of temporary
work has helped employment. And Jupp&eacute;'s social security reform does
much to improve transparency and accountability in social security spending.
Also, a sensible tax reform to lessen the burden of taxation on top earners
and the poor is being prepared. But such reforms work slowly. Fast results
are needed. <BR>
<BR>
The final decision date for EMU is somewhere in the first half of 1998,
when 1997 Maastricht convergence measures are finally gauged. Where will
France be by then? I think it will have a budget deficit well above the
3% criterion, at around 4.4% of GDP. That rules France out of EMU from a
German perspective. Germany will then obtain a postponement of EMU. France
will say it's for German domestic reasons (popular opposition to giving
up the Deutschmark). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Not worth a divorce</B> <BR>
<BR>
What happens in France when it becomes clear that it cannot make EMU is
anyone's guess. There is no serious discussion about any credible alternative
policy for France other than sticking with Germany. Politically, the end
of the Franco-German axis would split the governing UDR party and fragment
president Chirac's support almost as much as continuing to adhere to an
EMU policy. The struggle for economic and monetary union has led to low
growth and little employment, but it has absorbed 15 years of constant effort
and economic sacrifice. The Franco-German axis is like a comfortable but
loveless marriage - giving it up may ultimately yield a more enticing end
result, but is it worth the trauma of a divorce? That makes the outcome
very uncertain. <BR>
<BR>
If pushed, I think that social pressures will build and France will ultimately
have to go for growth once EMU has been postponed. When that happens, the
French franc could fall 10% towards its ERM limit. And, the nominal spread
of French 10-year bonds over German bunds would widen to between 170bp and
200bp in anticipation of higher future French inflation. And yes, French
equities could perform.<BR>

<H3>THE MOORGATE SAGA </H3>
<H2>Everything must go </H2>
<H4>The Metropolitan Club of the City of Washington, 1700 H Street, NW, Washington,
DC</H4> <BR>
<BR>
Now that the United States is in Chapter 11 I dare say the District of Columbia
is strapped for cash, on my way in from Dulles I notice the bailiffs on
Pennsylvania Avenue, and up on Capitol Hill old Catwiesl is busy telling
me how the White House is down to its last two chefs, Newt is monitoring
the position closely, when the last chef quits and the President is driven
back to Mrs Clinton's cooking, he surrenders, Newt says. <BR>
<BR>
<B>I</B> expect to find Catwiesl warming up for election year, you recall
how ever since he is a tiny kid he wants to be Vice President, four years
ago he fights epic battles with J Danforth Quayle in the New Hampshire primary,
but this time he plans to stay put on the Hill, just like Newt, he says,
he campaigns as the Congressman who always wants to be Deputy Speaker. <BR>
<BR>
Until now he hints there is a place booked for your boy in a Catwiesl vice
administration, like deputy secretary of treasury or vice chairman of the
council of economic advisors, and when he first calls me up in Moorgate
I figure he just requires an instant economic policy, the guy is always
a plank or two short of a platform. <BR>
<BR>
Instead he comes on with a posse of searching questions, such as is this
administration going bust, and does it matter, and who notices, and how
long can they carry on after we cut off the money, and how come the prospect
does not terrify the markets, the Dow heads off towards the Big Five G and
the long bond makes high after high, which for security in imminent danger
of default is quite something. <BR>
<BR>
Not knowing the answers, I figure maybe they are at the end of the wire,
in which case it is time I go and look for them, so maybe they tell me the
market calls this right, but if not I have the greatest insider short sale
since old Joe Kennedy in his prime, maybe they put me in charge of the SEC,
like they do with Joe. <BR>
<BR>
Like that I travel hopefully, tho' my hopes kinda sink when I catch up with
Catwiesl up in his eyrie, and before even he dips into his bureau drawer
to pour a bourbon and branch he tells me the oldest lie in the markets,
he says: This time it is different. <BR>
<BR>
This time (he says) we mean it, not a red cent do we vote for this administration,
Newt's mind is made up when he boards Air Force One and finds himself seated
in steerage, by the john, which flushes every two minutes and keeps him
awake, now he figures one thing this country can economize on is a President,
and but for a gerrymandered vote in Philadelphia in 1787 we do not have
one, Congress is there first. <BR>
<BR>
It stands to reason without a President we can balance the budget sooner
than he can, like for openers we ground Air Force One, and with the money
we save Newt can upgrade to executive class, he says the perfectly balanced
budget is one that adds up to zero on both sides, and we make a start by
cutting off revenues. <BR>
<BR>
We have them licked by now if it is not for this guy Rubin, do you come
across him when he is at Goldman Sachs, only the other day the Treasury
is short of money to pay interest or some such, so he just dips into a pair
of retirement funds and comes up with $62 billion, some of us wonder where
he gets such ideas from, do I recall how Goldman once advises Robert Maxwell?
<BR>
<BR>
<B>M</B>om, by this time I can see what is coming and along it comes, Newt
and I figure (says Catwiesl) we need a financial maven to field against
Rubin, and, Herbie, you're tapped, anything Goldman can do the Last National
Bank of Boot Hill can do better, and you can be sure when Newt forms his
non-administration there is something and nothing for you. <BR>
<BR>
Put like that I do not figure I can yet give up the day job, but after the
guy twists my arm and appeals to my better nature and pours some more bourbon
I offer to write him a position paper, dealing with the key issue of the
moment, which is how long can Rubin hold out and what else does he dream
up? <BR>
<BR>
For a start, my paper starts, forget any savings from closing the zoo down
and eating the zebras, this is just what is called the Beggar's Sore Technique,
beggars in office use it to embarrass their paymasters and melt their hearts,
pay no attention, says my paper, harden your hearts and tell these guys
to get themselves on workfare. <BR>
<BR>
For serious money you need creative financing, the first stop from the Treasury
is four blocks down on I Street, after fifty years it is high time the IMF
does something for its biggest stockholder, we draw our full quota and trigger
the general arrangements to borrow and go for an enhanced facility for structural
adjustment, here is another financial crisis the IMF does not see coming.
<BR>
<BR>
Which reminds me, Mexico, those guys can get their gluteal muscles in gear
and do something for us, howsabout a new issue of T-bonds which convert
into tesobonos, at a discount, naturally, we call them Zedillos, they are
tailor-made for Holey Buckett's fund which specializes in submerging markets.
<BR>
<BR>
After that we do like the Brits do and sell off the family silver, only
for us it is gold, I claim my corporate finance department is standing by
to privatize Fort Knox, which is a real no-brainer unless the Treasury already
shorts the contents, as I more than suspect, and next for sale are Nasa
and the Statue of Liberty and the US army engineers' reserve of spare parts
for steam locomotives. <BR>
<BR>
You can see that this war is not all over by Christmas, my advice to Newt
is he adopts my paper as his policy and undertakes to abolish taxation,
and if this works I maybe settle for the London embassy, alternatively how
does he plan to make it worth my while not to show my paper to Bob Rubin?
<BR>
<BR>
So maybe after all this time it is different, but I do not bet that way,
I set a stop-loss on T-bonds at the price at which they convert into lampshades,
much love from <BR>
<BR>
Your creative son, <BR>
<BR>
Herbie <BR>
<BR>
<B>Herbie is tapped by Christopher Fildes </B> <p>

<H2>Euromoney Awards for Excellence 1996 </H2>
This year, Euromoney's Awards for Excellence are broader in scope than ever
before. A number of new categories have been introduced to reflect changes
in the structure of international markets. In order to highlight the full
range of different services in the derivatives market, we have added the
category of most innovative derivatives house to complement the best derivatives
house and best risk adviser awards. Secondary market equity activity is
often overlooked in awards such as these. This year we have changed this
by giving an award to the institution we consider to be the best international
brokerage firm. <BR>
<BR>
The whole area of debt and equity research is changing and it will be fascinating
to see which of the two main approaches - local market research or global
sectoral research - will out. This year, Euromoney is inaugurating two new
awards for research: best international equity research house and best emerging
markets research house. <BR>
<BR>
By contrast, a number of categories have been suspended. For instance, over
the period between last year's and this year's awards, there were only two
dozen or so international equity issues in the emerging markets. That meant
it was almost impossible to gauge how well each institution did in that
category. With so many deals in the pipeline, though, the category will
be reinstated next year. For the same reason, the category of privatization
adviser has also been put on hold for the year, and the most dominant firm
in a sector or niche may re-emerge in 1997. <BR>
<BR>
We strive to make the Euromoney Awards for Excellence the definitive guide
to which banks are best in different areas of the global capital markets.
<BR>
<BR>
The decision-making process for the awards was exhaustive. Our editors drew
up a shortlist of candidates in each category based on league tables, the
banks' profitability, our own polls and our journalists' market soundings.
<BR>
<BR>
We tried to maintain our standards for fairness and accuracy by asking candidates
nominated in the overall awards to provide us with a brief synopsis of their
strengths in the chosen categories. Editor Garry Evans and contributing
editor Katharine Morton then conducted meetings with as many people shortlisted
as possible. In a one-month period, they met with more than 120 people in
three countries. These meetings paid close attention to each firm's qualities,
managerial structure, focus, ability to innovate as well as profitability
and positioning among peers. <BR>
<BR>
The shortlist has deliberately been kept tighter than in previous years.
The new category of &quot;top tier&quot; reflects our belief that, in certain
categories, there is a first division of very high quality players that
have missed achieving the highest award by a whisker or that have risen
into the first league over the past year. At the same time, we have retained
the &quot;one to watch&quot; tag for firms that are outside our shortlists
but which we believe stand a good chance of making the grade. The final
decisions were then made by a committee of Euromoney's senior editors. <BR>
<BR>
Once again Citibank flourished in the awards. Its strategy of concentrating
on corporate and emerging markets business has become more finely tuned
over the past year. Other winners include SBC Warburg, whose merger has
settled in rapidly; and Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, which are very
difficult to chose between in terms of quality and global reach. Chase has
also made a dent on the awards; although clearly it will take a while to
gauge whether the Chemical merger has given the firm a one-off boost or
a real push up to a new level. We will be surprised if the firm doesn't
win more awards next year.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="bestbank"></A>Best bank </H2>
<H3>Citibank </H3>
Last year was a pivotal one for Citibank. Not only was 1995 a strikingly
good year for performance - earnings climbed to $3.5 billion and return
on equity soared to 20.8% - it was also marked by steps forward in strategy
and outlook. The firm has laid out a series of business directions that
will play to its strengths in its consumer and corporate banking franchise,
and differentiate it from its competitors. <BR>
<BR>
On the consumer side of the business, which made up 52% of Citi's $982 million
first-quarter core business earnings, the firm is building a strong brand
image of efficient, convenient, high-quality banking - or &quot;Citibanking&quot;.
This brand is carried across its entire operations in 98 countries. The
major turnaround in strategy over the past year, though, comes on the corporate
banking side where the bank has moved from a geographic focus to a client
focus. Citi's entire 1,400-client target market is now served by dedicated
global teams that manage relationships with each client in whichever market
they operate. Even though Citi has contracted its assets, revenues have
grown as its customer base has started demanding more complex product solutions
in a variety of different markets, rather than simply loans. And as its
clients look towards the emerging markets as the source of growth, they
will rely more and more on Citibank's unrivalled franchise. <BR>
<BR>
Citibank is not driving for growth for its own sake. Indeed, the firm is
looking at its balance sheet in a much more disciplined way than would have
been the case five years ago. Already, Citibank is on a much stronger footing,
having boosted total capital to $27.7 billion last year. The firm has also
announced a $4.5 billion stock buy-back programme. <BR>
<BR>
The top executives in the firm are acutely aware that technology, risk management
and people will be the keys to retaining its leading position. Citi is devoting
considerable resources to technology development, and to streamlining and
integrating its checks and balances for risk across the company. In terms
of personnel, the bank itself is hacking away at its corporate centre, devolving
into flexible, smaller units able to adapt to local market conditions, and
is very adept at moving its talent around. With such a focused vision, Citibank
will be a tough one to beat. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Top tier</B> <I>HSBC</I> A marathon runner rather than a sprinter, it
is hard to argue with a bank whose holding group had shareholder equity
of $26.7 billion, a return on average equity of 15.62% and net profits of
$3.8 billion last year. <HR>
<H2><BR>
<A NAME="mostimproved"></A>Most improved bank </H2>
<H3>Standard Chartered </H3>
After its nadir as an unwieldy and old-fashioned bank was reached in 1992,
Standard Chartered decided to get rid of the seaweed around its propellers.
This was done by ruthlessly refocusing the firm's activities, increasing
integration and selling peripheral elements of its business, and getting
out of commercial property lending. Standard Chartered is focusing on its
strong franchises in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, and on its core businesses
of personal, corporate and institutional banking, consumer finance, treasury,
custody and investment banking. <BR>
<BR>
The strategy has worked. Standard Chartered achieved a return on equity
of 28% in 1995 from only 6% in 1992, and earnings per share of 45.9 pence
in 1995, from only 6.2 pence in 1992. A total of 68% of the group's &#163;661
million ($1.01 billion) pre-tax profits last year came from the Asia-Pacific
region. <BR>
<BR>
Personal banking alone accounts for around 30% of total profits - a key
reason for this is that Standard Chartered is attuned to the burgeoning
demand for credit cards and personal mortgages. <BR>
<BR>
Corporate banking is becoming more focused on trade finance and cash management,
and institutional banking is being driven by the aim of being the &quot;bankers'
bank&quot; in all the regions on which Standard Chartered focuses. The treasury
group is focusing on its strength in exotic currencies, and the group's
sub-custodian services, under the banner of Equitor, are proving very successful.
<BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, investment banking has been trimmed and organized to support
the bank's Asian and oecd customer base. Costs are being broadly held down
to the levels prevailing in 1993 and 1994, bureaucracy is being whittled
away and the group is becoming more centralized technologically. <BR>
<BR>
Can the return on equity be sustained? Certainly a figure in the mid-20s
will be achievable, given that the growth in the core businesses is sustained.
<BR>
<BR>
From an old-fashioned loosely connected banking group, Standard Chartered
is now developing along the lines of a well-tuned bank which has carefully
controlled risks, and a profit and loss account which is more predictable.<HR>
<H2><A NAME="capitalmarkets"></A>Most improved capital markets bank </H2>
<H3>ABN Amro </H3>
ABN Amro wins the most improved capital markets bank for the second time
in succession, because it keeps getting better. The firm wants to be among
the top five investment banks in the world and this, somewhat startlingly,
no longer looks like a vain hope. <BR>
<BR>
ABN Amro is still marching up the league tables as an underwriter of Eurobonds
and globals, pitching in at number 11 in the year to May 1996 from 14 in
the previous year. Indeed, the firm's bookrunner volume increased by 40%
in 1995, according to its own figures. In the syndicated loan arranger tables,
the firm is number eight outside the us and number 12 in the world. <BR>
<BR>
The rapidity of its move from merely having a stronghold in the guilder
market continues to be a source of surprise to many of its competitors.
Its guilder imbalance has now fallen below 50% of its international bond
business and the firm is pushing hard to increase its diversity. <BR>
<BR>
ABN Amro's progress in the us is incremental. With 80 sales people dedicated
to us placement, the firm's capacity to distribute product in the us is
better than many players recognize. <BR>
<BR>
Significant dollar deals over the past year include several Dutch companies,
such as Unilever, BNG's three-way (dollar, Swiss francs and guilders), and
the bank's own global and yankee. <BR>
<BR>
Over the past 18 months, ABN Amro has added 180 people to its fixed-income
and derivatives business, and is pushing hard into Asian origination and
trying hard to find its niche in the agency market. In emerging markets,
the firm has scored some notable successes, such as Electrobras' split $150
million/&#165;100 million bond offering, which was the firm's first-ever
joint yen lead, and CEZ's ckr4 billion 10-year domestic bond sale, the longest
tenor bond in the Czech Republic's home market. <BR>
<BR>
In the equity market, ABN Amro Hoare Govett's major equity positions increased
significantly over the past year. While Hoare Govett has been brought under
the ABN Amro branding, the firm is waiting for the equity market to become
more integrated before it brings Rothschild under the ABN Amro tag. <HR>
<H2><A NAME="bestsmaller"></A>Best smaller bank </H2>
<H3>Banco Santander </H3>
Aggressive but focused, Banco Santander successfully achieved many of its
ambitious goals last year. Diversification, across products and regions,
and innovation remain the watchwords of the group. The bank's post-tax return
on equity figure of 14.8% reects the dilution caused by the group's purchase
of ailing Spanish bank Banesto in 1994. Even so, Santander has managed to
whip Banesto rapidly into shape, putting in a new management team, cleaning
up the balance sheets and refocusing the business. Other purchases - including
finance company fusa in Chile, Creditos Personales in Uruguay, Interandino
and Mercantil in Peru - and the establishment of Banco Santander Philippines,
all contribute to the group's impressive long-term earnings outlook. <BR>
<BR>
In its home market, the retail banking arm has an enviable reputation for
innovation and has been increasing its market share of total borrowed and
managed funds to more than 7.4% in 1995 from just 4% in 1988. Santander
has consistently gained more than 20% of the growth in deposits in the financial
system, even during the Banesto acquisition. Its relaunched mortgage product,
Superhipoteca, has helped the firm to increase its base of stable customers.
Also, the ibos interbank operating system which hooks up banks to facilitate
retail business has been a great success, linking the group with Royal Bank
of Scotland and Citibank, among others. Santander Investments, the investment
banking arm of the group, is successfully diversifying outside Spain, gaining
an important franchise selling Latin American, peseta, south European and
Spanish-related products into the us institutional market. <HR>
<H2><A NAME="capitalraising"></A>Capital-raising house </H2>
<H3>Morgan Stanley </H3>
In the 12 months to June, Morgan Stanley raised $65.7 billion in debt and
equity capital in the international markets. It's not only the size of the
amount raised that has won Morgan Stanley an award for excellence as a capital-raising
house, but also the scope, quality and innovation it brings to the market.
In the debt market, Morgan Stanley raised the equivalent of $42 billion
in 180 deals in the international markets. The firm raised $23.7 billion
of equity and equity-related capital in 53 deals over the past year. More
than half of the value of its equity deals ($13.6 billion) has been from
non-us issuers. <BR>
<BR>
These range from the largest two non-privatization first public offerings
ever, through to the second-largest convertible bond ever ($2 billion for
Mitsubishi Bank) and the second-largest private secondary offer ever ($1.5
billion for Gucci). Demand for the Mitsubishi convertible climbed above
$10 billion and the structure was innovative with a downward reset on the
conversion price. For Gucci, the secondary offer followed on from the success
of its $620 million IPO, the largest ever by an Italian company or by a
luxury-goods company, for which Morgan Stanley acted as global coordinator
and bookrunner. <BR>
<BR>
In a highly competitive market, Morgan Stanley has carved a niche in the
luxury goods area, doing deals for Bulgari and Harvey Nichols, in addition
to Gucci. <BR>
<BR>
Morgan Stanley has also had impressive results from its activities in the
technology sector, particularly with the flotation of Netscape (although
it did lose its team to Deutsche Morgan Grenfell immediately afterwards).

<B>Top tier</B> <I>Merrill Lynch</I> From raising funds for Swiss cantons
to South African IPOs, Merrill has raised its profile in all the countries
in which it operates. <HR>
<H2><A NAME="leadmanager"></A>Lead manager, Euro and global bonds </H2>
<H3>Merrill Lynch </H3>
Although league-table position is not everything in the Eurobond and global
markets, Merrill Lynch is on top. Even stripping out the large number of
asset-backed deals done out of the US market and sold as global bonds -
a practice which encouraged the chief criticism of the bank's league-table
position from its peers - Merrill Lynch is still number one. <BR>
<BR>
Merrill's success in bringing dollar issues to the global market cannot
be ignored. Most notable was Walt Disney's $2.6 billion global, the largest-ever
corporate issue and the largest corporate global. Merrill has had notable
success opening out the global market. It led the United Mexican States'
$1 billion 9.75% global due 2004, the largest emerging markets global issue,
and brought the first central European sovereign global bond for Hungary.
<BR>
<BR>
But to answer Merrill's detractors, the firm is predominant not only in
dollars - it has also managed to extend the diversity of the currencies
in which it issues. Since last year, the bank has issued in 14 different
currencies and is the leading non-domestic underwriter in French francs,
Swiss francs and yen in 1995, and so far in 1996, and brought the first
yen global for two years, a &#165;100 billion global for FNMA. <BR>
<BR>
And it's not just bulk. Merrill's record in terms of innovation has been
outstanding over the past year. For General Electric, it launched the first
Euro-Czech crown bond (10.5% due 1998) and the first Euro-rand issue. <BR>
<BR>
Merrill does not pound the market, and its deals are priced to sell. One
of the aspects that differentiates Merrill is its huge distribution network
and the balance it has been able to strike between its institutional and
retail distribution, particularly in Europe. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Top tier</B> <I>SBC Warburg</I> The top Eurobond house, SBC Warburg corners
a large part of the traditional end of the market. The criticism that it
relies too heavily on the Swiss retail bid is often made, but it is an easy
jibe. While the firm is not attempting to compete selling us domestic product,
it has supplemented its retail sector strength with an increasingly strong
institutional placement worldwide: the main example is the IADB's inaugural
$1 billion, 10-year global bond. Institutionally targeted bonds include
the Republic of Portugal's ffr4 billion 12-year issue and the Halifax's
&#163;300 million subordinated issue. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Top tier</B> <I>Morgan Stanley</I> The breadth of its deals is worthy

broad reach in globals. <HR>
<H2><A NAME="intequity"></A>International equity underwriter </H2>
<H3>Morgan Stanley </H3>
After having hidden its light for almost two years, Morgan Stanley has emerged
as the dominant and most active underwriter of international equity. Although
the firm had lagged in privatization deals, now that that market is becoming
progressively less significant it has come to the forefront of the market
for large private-sector corporate IPOs. <BR>
<BR>
The firm has secured good franchises in the telecoms, transportation and
luxury goods sectors, and 21 out of the 53 deals done over the period were
for non-US issuers. In the primary market, the largest and second-largest
non-privatization IPOs ever were underwritten by the firm. Morgan Stanley
acted as global coordinator and bookrunner for both telecommunications company
Lucent's $3 billion IPO/spin-off and Scania's $2.97 billion public offering.
The former was one of the largest corporate restructurings ever; the latter,
the first Swedish company to secure a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
In the technology sector, Morgan Stanley secured a $900 million secondary
offering for French electronics company SGS Thomson (at a time when the
market was extremely volatile) and also acted as global coordinator for
Netscape. <BR>
<BR>
Even though its privatization mandates remain limited, the firm did manage
to turn around the $1.3 billion Argentaria privatization in a relatively
short time - the bank was floated 49 days after the firm was appointed global
coordinator - in a very unstable environment. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Top tier </B><I>Goldman Sachs</I> Goldman has had a good year in international
equity, and next year will be an even better one, with a lot in the pipeline.
More a deer than an elephant in terms of the size of deals it has been doing,

from privatizations to corporate capital raising. <HR>
<H2><A NAME="derivatives"></A>Derivatives house </H2>
<H3>JP Morgan </H3>
A leading position in providing product across the board in all asset classes
and an image of integrity and quality gives JP Morgan the edge. The firm
has a fine reputation for analysis, managing risk, sophisticated research
and creating innovative derivative products. <BR>
<BR>
In terms of product, JP Morgan's notional swap and interest rate derivatives
book was $1.5 trillion last year, up 55% on 1994, and it executed 32,400
trades for 2,000 clients. Morgan dominates the market for dollar, yen and
Deutschmark swaps and options. The firm trades foreign exchange derivative
products in major currencies and has been developing short-term interest
rate products, the latest being the overnight indexed swap. <BR>
<BR>
JP Morgan has had an innovative year. The first inflation-linked private
placement in lire was syndicated out by the firm last year. It was at the
forefront of providing tailor-made hedging capabilities on a cross-asset
class basis and also developing two-factor strategies. It has also been
instrumental in promoting the growth of the credit derivatives market. Combining
equity risk with interest rate and foreign exchange risk across all major
equity markets has been one of the more innovative client solutions provided
by the firm; and at the same time, the underlying OTC business grew more
than 40% in 1995. <BR>
<BR>
Regulatory issues in the derivatives market are of obvious concern and JP
Morgan has been active in the establishment of an ISDA task-force to standardize
documentation. Through its risk-measurement system, RiskMetrics, and a risk
management tool, FourFifteen, JP Morgan has been providing its clients with
an important way of handling risk. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Top tier</B> <I>SBC Warburg</I> SBC Warburg has made a rapid switch from

<BR>
<B>Top tier</B> <I>Citibank</I> Citibank has a clear focus: the client is
king. That goes for derivatives, too, and the house is driven entirely by

equity derivatives with around 60% of its clients, and regards derivatives
as it does corporate finance. <BR>

<B>One to watch</B> <I>Chase</I> The new Chase combines Chemical's high-volume

<H2><A NAME="mostinnovative"></A>Most innovative derivatives house </H2>
<H3>Merrill Lynch </H3>
Being good at selling ever-more wacky products is no longer a sufficient
or even appropriate criterion for choosing the most innovative derivatives
house. The key is tailor-made solutions for individual clients or markets.
In this category Merrill Lynch scores highly. For instance, Merrill underscored
its position as leading derivative structured finance arranger in commodity-linked
deals with its $250 million five-year aluminium-linked loan for Dubal, a
smelter in Dubai. This set out to guarantee that the price of aluminium
would be high enough to guarantee and justify the return on equity for seven
years. But Merrill also excels in introducing interesting products. These
include economic indicator derivatives, Merrill Lynch's fixed- and floating-rate
options on GDP, offering hedges and quasi-hedges, while running a warehouse
of risk. <BR>
<BR>
On Merrill Lynch's own account, the firm has been establishing credit derivatives
in the form of country default-linked notes (for Turkey) and the securitization
of the country's swap portfolio. The potential for such credit instruments,
if a warehouse system is developed to offer mismatches on exposure, could
be huge. Merrill has also been at the forefront of developing interesting
structures for emerging markets, ranging from special purpose vehicles in
the Netherlands for Thai bonds to avoid domestic withholding tax to the
first asset swap into dollars of Russian GKOs. In currency options, Merrill
has pushed out the envelope in terms of long-dated (30-year) tree-currency
chooser options targeted at Japanese investors and listing the first best-of-two
currency option on the American Stock Exchange. And in third-generation
derivatives, those exotic derivatives using three-factor structures, multiple
currencies and markets, or advanced path-dependent option structures, Merrill
is a market leader. <HR>
<H2><A NAME="riskadvisor"></A>Risk adviser </H2>
<H3>Bankers Trust </H3>
The Procter &amp; Gamble scandal weighs hard on Bankers Trust's reputation
in derivatives. But the lessons from that episode have given the bank an
eye for risk management that is second to none. Its experience with its
internal risk measurement and management system has helped it build up an
impressive risk management advisory group over the past five years. Where
Bankers comes out on top is that risk advisory is far from a product sell,
and has become more akin to a corporate finance or mergers and acquisitions
function. And while other areas of the firm may have sold derivative products
incorrectly in the past, the risk advisory group's reputation is endorsed
by the fact that throughout the whole P&amp;G debacle clients have still
been coming in. <BR>
<BR>
The firm's internal system was used as the basis for developing the industry-standard
measure of risk-adjusted return on capital (Raroc). Last year BT launched
its risk management system for clients, called Raroc 2020, which measures
risk at both an aggregate and individual level on a tailored basis. <BR>
<BR>
The risk management advisory group provides a tailored service that goes
beyond just quantifying risk. A full-scale risk management advisory assignment,
such as that for Coral Energy Resources, a new joint venture between Shell
Oil and Tejas Gas, in July 1995, often leads to the company changing the
whole way it runs its business. In another case, Bankers Trust was brought
in by Abbey National Treasury Services' back office on a contract basis
in order to apply its dynamic knowledge of risk management to the allocation
of capital on the basis of operational risk. <BR>
<BR>
One odd outcome is that frequently after looking at all policies and procedures
across a company, the actual derivatives activity falls or is at least simplified.

&quot;If it ain't broke, make it better.&quot; Eighteen years at the top
of <I>Euromoney'</I>s 1996 global foreign exchange poll, and that motto
still describes Citibank's foreign exchange service as it continues to improve.
With 80 treasury centres trading around 140 currencies, Citibank has the
widest spread of treasury operations of any bank. Not only is Citi competitive
in OECD markets and a leader in foreign exchange options and currency forwards,
it is also the predominant bank in emerging market currencies. Citibank
also makes the most money from foreign exchange trading revenues: nearly
$1.1 billion in 1995, almost double its 1994 revenues and close to twice
as much as its nearest rival. <BR>
<BR>
Technology is a key driver in the foreign exchange business and customers
demand continuity, speed, consistency and excellence. To keep meeting their
expectations, Citibank is aiming at giving customers a single point of entry
into the entire Citibank network, giving them access to outstanding services
at any time, anywhere. <BR>
<BR>
This price distribution would make it no harder, say, to get a price on
the Mexican peso in Helsinki than a price on dollar/Deutschmark. And the
bank is gearing up for the world after European monetary union by centralizing
pricing in Europe into fewer centres and investing heavily in its sales
force and common market data platforms. <BR>

Looking forward, Citibank's strength in emerging market currencies makes
it uniquely placed to stay ahead in foreign exchange markets post-Emu. <BR>

<H3>Chase </H3>
One area in which the new Chase benefits immediately from its merger with
Chemical is in syndicated loans. Chase's US syndication team, headed by
former Chemical man Jimmy Lee, is very highly regarded in the US and has
the longest tenure of any in the industry in a market where experience does
count. The leading arranger and provider of syndicated loans in the US for
the past four years, Chase is making a push in Europe, exporting technology
and people from the US. In the first quarter of 1996 alone, Chase did the
highest number of deals in the European syndication market and has played
a significant role in acquisition financing for recent large UK transactions,
including the &#163;2.5 billion Granada Forte deal, gpu-Cinergy/Midlands
(&#163;1.5 billion) and Trafalgar House/Kv&aelig;rner (&#163;450 million).
In Latin America, Chase was the top arranger of Latin loans last year and
is developing high-yield deals in Asia. <BR>
<BR>
Chase has experience in complex transactions and getting high-value deals
in the US. In 1995 it arranged $7.5 billion for Westinghouse's acquisition
of cbs, the largest sub-investment grade acquisition financing completed
since the RJR Nabisco transaction in 1989. Chase's efforts in convincing
the directors, advisers and management of CBS that financing was possible
and in assuring underwriting banks that targeted hold levels could be achieved,
brought in commitments of over $7.5 billion five days from launch; a total
of $14 billion was committed in the end by over 50 lenders worldwide. More
recently, KMart has approached Chase to arrange a $3.7 billion facility
for the company. <BR>

<H2><A NAME="projectfin"></A>Project-finance house </H2>
<H3>Barclays </H3>
In a market that has all but commoditized, unless a bank knows its clients'
specific needs in project finance it may as well just concentrate on plain
vanilla. With many larger companies able to access plain-vanilla finance
on their own, what will differentiate the project-finance houses of the
future will be their ability to give expert advice on how to access capital
markets as a whole. Barclays has a long-standing reputation in project-finance
advisory and its integrated approach is providing a real benchmark for other
firms. For instance, BZW acted as adviser, arranger and sole underwriter
for Mission Energy, the development subsidiary of SCECorp, in its &#163;680
million ($1.04 billion) purchase of First Hydro Pumped Storage Business
from the UK National Grid in December. This involved BZW launching one of
the longest-dated corporate sterling bonds in the UK for First Hydro. The
&#163;400 million, 25-year unrated bond was secured by power plants that
get their revenues from trading power. The demand for the bonds, priced
aggressively at 115 basis points over gilts, was so great that a &#163;200
million term loan was never drawn down. Even two years ago, this sort of
deal was not possible and is a significant departure from traditional long-term
off-take contracts. <BR>

In terms of arranging, BZW is top tier. The firm has a virtual monopoly
of business out of the UK, but is diversified into most regions. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Top tier</B> <I>Citibank</I> Citibank merged five decentralized regional

Citibank's emerging markets business is booming. Although last year was
a record it will not make the firm rest on its laurels, because wholesale
emerging market banking is such a core business, and Citi has a clear strategy
for its emerging market operations. In corporate banking, which earned the
bank $1.1 billion last year and $393 million in the first quarter of 1996,
Citibank is targeting the top 1,400 companies. In consumer banking, the
top 20% are targeted; overall, consumer banking earnings were $804 million
last year and $224 million in the first quarter of this year. <BR>
<BR>
This long-term strategy goes hand-in-hand with the firm's commitment to
the development of local markets: as the economies grow and succeed, so
too will Citi's customer base. <BR>
<BR>
Citibank has an unrivalled ability to deliver both complex and simple wholesale
banking products, from cash management for oil companies in central Asia
to currency trading services for local banks in Vietnam. Also, the firm
has been involved in many significant deals, such as leading the $1 billion
Mexico bond offering, just nine months after the peso crisis, through to
arranging the first auto loan receivables securitization in Asia, the HK$500

consistency that is paying off. The firm is frequently the core provider
of liquidity-to-cash government bonds, strips, debt options and repo. <BR>
<BR>
JP Morgan's debt and economic research capabilities are highly regarded
and two products in particular are industry standards: the JP Morgan Government
Bond Index, which covers 16 countries, and its RiskMetrics risk measurement
and management tool. <BR>
<BR>
Rivals sometimes complain that Morgan suffers from coordination problems,
though the firm's traders are fully integrated across countries through
a &quot;hoot-'n'-holler&quot; system. The firm has the advantage of real-time
data, analytics and pricing models across all markets and total information
fluidity. This gives the firm the ability to track and execute rapidly.

<H3>SBC Warburg </H3>
A stable and unique structure for its Eurobond trading operations and a
deep knowledge of the market puts SBC Warburg on top. The firm has a strong
team - one of the most stable in the market. In terms of structure, the
firm has separated credit, government and derivatives trading and, like
several of the top houses, does not allow directional trading (trading interest-rate
risk) on its credit fixed-income desks. This allows its operations to be
transparent, and focused on the needs of the client. All credit products
are integrated in the same pool with the same management and are valued
on similar models. The integrated trading books are instead split into three
books. The front book concentrates on liquid markets and underwriting books,
and accounts for the lion's share of client business and around 65% of total
turnover. The middle book manages asset swap and structured client business,
while the back book trades distressed debt and credit derivatives. This
means clients get the appropriate price service at the same time as being
supported by the appropriate technology, and they can focus on less liquid
market sectors. The structure allows SBC Warburg, as a market-maker in Eurobonds
and globals in over 12 currencies, to provide seamless product delivery
across all major currencies without dividing by region. <BR>
<BR>
The firm has an internationally integrated NEXT-based trading platform that
updates bond prices continually on a spread basis, in line with underlying
government and swaps markets. The trading platform has been extended in
the retail distribution area, so each Swiss branch has an order and execution
system. <BR>
<BR>
Apart from its strong Swiss base, the firm is building a solid reputation
in the US by having a good market-maker in international dollar product.

Trying to define success in the mergers and acquisitions business is a tricky
task. But, by any measure, Morgan Stanley is going from strength to strength.
In an operation broadly split between US, non-US and cross-border business,
it has been involved in nine of the 15 big deals in the world markets since
the beginning of 1995, four on a sole basis. In part its success comes down
to its early realization that industry specialization would be the main
cause of future business: it was right. The firm has advised nine out of
the 11 largest healthcare transactions; the most recent included the $6.7
billion Pharmacia-Upjohn merger, and that of Sandoz and Ciba Geigy ($28.2
billion, creating $20 billion in shareholder value). <BR>

In the converging telecoms and media industries, Morgan Stanley has advised
players such as Nynex Corp in its $31.6 billion merger with Bell Atlantic
and AT&amp;T with its restructuring and demerger, alongside Belgacom's $2.5

The firm has had a hand in many of the most significant corporate restructurings
over the past year, including GPA's debt restructuring and negotiation with
GE Capital and over 100 banks, and Volkswagen in the dissolution of its

<BR>
Morgan Stanley's strategic approach to mtn works well for issuers. Once
it arranges a programme it keeps a close eye on the legal aspects of programmes,
stays flexible, executes deals well and follows up. Liquidity in the firm's
private EMTNS is also enhanced by its liability management system, high
debt ratings and sound capital structure. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Top tier </B><I>Goldman Sachs</I> Euro-MTN dealers are judged on the
basis of distribution, origination and secondary trading, and Goldman performs
extremely well in all. It is selective in the arrangerships it seeks and
is a major player in the non-syndicated end of the market. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Top tier</B> <I>Merrill Lynch</I> Merrill has maintained its position
at the top of the official league tables and is the dominant firm in arrangerships.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Most improved</B> <I>ABN Amro</I> Having only started its operation in
April 1995 with a team from SG Warburg, ABN Amro is now threatening to move
out of its stronghold in guilders. It already boasts volumes of over $2
billion equivalent for 40 issuers in 13 currencies. <HR>
<H2><A NAME="assetbacked"></A>Underwriter of asset-backed debt </H2>
<H3>Citibank </H3>
Credit cards, cars and mortgages form the heartland of asset-backed debt
securities. Citi excels in these areas. But it is in the introduction of
new asset classes by new issuers in new regions that Citibank puts itself
in front. It is a leading force in private placements, public issuance and
multi-seller vehicles. <BR>
<BR>
The firm structured and led over 200 transactions worth over $24 billion
in 18 countries in 1995. The larger deals have been in credit cards: including
the development of trust liquidity certificates securitizing $750 million
of Citibank's own credit card portfolio, by using a hybrid bond-options
structure: this allows an issuer to use the cashflows from the portfolio
for liquidity in order to reduce costs, and has since been replicated elsewhere.
Citibank has also been securitizing us credit cards overseas, opening up
the market to the first yen issue in July 1995 and the first Deutschmark
issue in April 1996. In the car rental sector the firm organized a $1.5
billion securitization to finance the purchase of a fleet by a major us
car rental company. <BR>
<BR>
Citi continues to open up the asset-backed market, structuring and arranging
the &#165;22 billion ($2.84 billion) securitization of future Japanese film
royalty streams from News Corporation/Fox, undertaking the first German
mortgage-backed security and the first Italian Law 52 multi-seller vehicle.
<BR>
<BR>
More impressive still is the fact that $1 billion of the firm's asset-backed
business was in emerging markets. And over the last year, Citi has scored
many firsts here, including the first agricultural securitization from an
emerging market (Brazilian Ceval Alimentos' $150 million securitization
of future soya bean product export receivables), the first securitization
out of the former Soviet Union (for GE Turkmenistan) and the highest-rated
asset-backed security out of Brazil for Alcoa Aluminio. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Top tier </B><I>Morgan Stanley</I> The significance of the $4 billion
gpa deal cannot be understated. The airlines group deal is as one of the
most innovative uses of securitization to restructure a company: 229 planes
were used both to raise debt on the back of future lease rental streams
and as collateral to pay off bank loans. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Top tier</B> <I>Merrill Lynch </I>Merrill now devotes as many staff to
asset-backed as it does for corporate bond underwriting, and this is paying
off league table position.The firm was lead underwriter for $20 billion
in public transactions last year - half in the last quarter. <BR>
<BR>
<B>One to watch</B> <I>Nomura</I> <HR>
<H2><A NAME="emdebt"></A>Emerging market debt underwriter </H2>
<H3>Nomura </H3>
Nomura has secured itself a position as one of the single largest bookrunners
of emerging market debt since 1995. In the year to May 1996, it was bookrunner
for over $7 billion of emerging market debt in 47 issues. Having been one
of the earliest players on the ground in eastern Europe, Nomura pursued
a strategy of being selective about the issuers it worked with, starting
by gaining considerable experience with sovereign issuers then gradually
moving down the spectrum. The firm, so far, has the monopoly on underwriting
debt in the Baltic states, including deals for the Republic of Latvia, Republic
of Lithuania and City of Tallinn. In Latin America, while not in the Brady
markets, Nomura has had a degree of success, particularly out of Argentina
and Brazil. Its Republic of Brazil yen jumbo helped reopen the primary market
for emerging market borrowers after the peso crisis and was increased in
size from &#165;50 billion to &#165;80 billion. In Asia, most of its business
has been done in the form of samurai bonds. <BR>
<BR>
The firm has focused on sovereign product, so far, partly because it plays
to the firm's distribution strength in the Japanese market. <BR>
<BR>
Nomura is now looking at other credits and is pinpointing the private sector
in eastern Europe. With its track record of moving in rapidly as a market
is deregulated, it stands a good chance of success. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Top tier</B> <I>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</I> DMG's success in August
with a five-year dm1 billion offering for the Republic of Argentina spread
at 342 basis points over Bunds helped cement the firm's reputation in the
Deutschmark sector for emerging market issuers. This came on top of noteworthy
deals for the National Bank of Hungary and Banco Bradesco's first foreign
currency bond issue, and DMG is also carving itself a niche in the dollar
sector. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Top tier </B><I>JP Morgan</I> A number of well-received deals have put
JP Morgan on the map in emerging markets. These include opening up the Eurozloty
market, regenerating India with ICICI and introducing Ayala Corp from the
Philippines to the market. <BR>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="dombankem"></A>Domestic bank in an emerging market </H2>
<H3>Bradesco </H3>
Winning this award for an unprecedented second time, Brazil's Banco Bradesco
just keeps improving. No frills, no flashiness, the country's largest private
sector bank posted net profits of $555 million last year, and its capitalization
as a percentage of risk-weighted assets soared to 27.2% - the highest in
the region. <BR>
<BR>
A natural caution, born of its experience with 20 years of hyper-inflation,
means that the bank focuses on providing a strong bulwark against the vagaries
of its home market rather than a stupendous return on equity. This was 11.2%
in 1995. But as a conservative bank, with a large proportion of its shares
held by charities, Bradesco is more an institution than just another bank.
<BR>
<BR>
The firm's dominant franchise is in providing retail banking services for
the medium- and low-income section of the population through its 1,855 branches
in Brazil, and it has 5.2 million current and 13.2 million savings accounts.
This means that in a time of relative monetary stability its lower-income
customer base has become more wealthy, as their savings are no longer eroded
as rapidly by inflation. Bradesco is strong in all areas, including insurance
and leasing subsidiaries. Though old-fashioned, it is embracing electronic
banking and has an agreement with Microsoft to work with Money software;
its processing abilities are envied by its competitors. Bradesco has thrived
by knowing its own market intimately, and by realizing experience really
does count. With only two branches outside Brazil, and no plans to become
more international, the firm wins by sticking to what it knows best. <HR>
<H2><A NAME="globalcustody"></A>Global custodian </H2>
<H3>Chase </H3>
Chase Global Investor Services is the world's largest custodian, with around
$3 trillion in assets under its aegis, according to the firm's figures.
It has not stood still since it won this award last year, though. In 1995
the firm won 130 new clients. More significantly still, it has added 25
new clients since the Chemical Bank merger was announced, adding $125 billion
in new assets under custody. The merger also added capabilities in areas
such as broker-dealer clearing and securities lending, along with Chemical's
strong reputation on Wall Street. <BR>
<BR>
Chase's agent bank network covers 66 markets, with four added last year
and a further eight to be added in 1996. It has an unrivalled capacity to
serve its clients using local languages across time zones. <BR>
<BR>
Chase's clearly defined strategy on a country-by-country basis helped it
to become the first foreign custodian selected by a major German corporation,
Hoechst, to provide global custody for its pension assets. It has also been
able to use its leverage, as custodian of choice for US mutual funds, to
remain their custodian as they move into emerging markets. <BR>
<BR>
Chase continues to invest heavily in its custody, accounting and performance-measurement
systems, and will pour around $75 million into its operations this year.
The firm has introduced extra foreign exchange capabilities, including an
automated block trading tool to improve the rates fund managers achieve
through aggregating and netting trades across counterparties, and has re-engineered
its settlement capability to allow clients trading with Chase to initiate
both sides of foreign exchange settlement electronically. Its global &quot;cash
sweep&quot; product allows clients to access short-term investment funds
in different currencies or separate accounts for different investment opportunities
for their currency balances outside the US. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Top tier</B> <I>Citibank</I> Citi has a very different profile to Chase,
acting more often as a sub-custodian, but one that provides serious competition.
It is integrating its operations to a much larger extent than its chief
rival, a policy that may pay off in terms of reducing costs, cutting down
on fails, enhancing its cross-border capabilities and dominating a number
of key companies over the long term. <BR>
<BR>
<B>One to watch</B> <I>Bank of New York</I> A prestigious customer franchise.
The dominant US service provider. Huge and efficient. These are all phrases
that can be applied to Bank of New York's custody operations. The BankAmerica
and JP Morgan acquisitions have substantially increased its presence in
global custody. <BR>
<BR>
The firm has retained most of JP Morgan's clients and has since won new
business, including Norwich Union's &#163;11 billion uk custody business.
Time will tell whether domiciling its global operations in Brussels will
pay off. <HR>
<H2><A NAME="newissuers"></A>Best at bringing new issuers to market </H2>
<H3>Nomura </H3>
Four or five years ago, when Nomura first went into eastern Europe, few
would have imagined that the Japanese house would have had so much success
in bringing emerging European issuers to the international debt markets.
Nomura does not have masses of staff in the region, nor has it attempted
to go for a scatter-shot approach. Instead, the firm started with the sovereign
issuers, the Czech government, say, and from thence was able to secure mandates
from the City of Prague. This selective tactic has been replicated across
its eastern European operations and has been instrumental in giving Nomura
a virtual monopoly on issuing for the Baltic States. <BR>
<BR>
The firm has proven itself to be extremely agile in nipping into a market
as soon as it is deregulated, as shown by its approach towards the German
Landesbanks. The largest single provider for German borrowers since 1991,
Nomura brought the first issue for L-Bank to the dollar market, initiated
three dollar trades in two and a half months for DSL, reopening the market
after the February employment figures, engaging in the first MTN trade for
Rentenbank and has brought $2.5 billion in German securities to the market
in the first five months of 1996. Europe is not the only region in which
Nomura has excelled. Its geographical approach helps it spot arbitrage opportunities
and potential deregulation, spanning both investment grade and emerging
market borrowers, straight bonds and asset-backed securities anywhere from
Tunisia (Central Bank of Tunisia) to the Philippines (National Power Corp).
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="strategicmerger"></A>Most successful strategic merger </H2>
<H3>SBC Warburg </H3>
SBC seems to have a knack of judging just what makes a good strategic fit.
Only one year on from the purchase of the UK's biggest merchant bank, SG
Warburg, it all seems very natural. SBC Warburg now has the highest return
on equity of any Swiss bank - 14.1% in 1995 - the merger has been fully
integrated across all 40 of the companies in which the firm operates, and
the firm has won new business and actually increased its client base. Back
in July this success seemed far from assured. The merger was huge, rapid
and climactic. SBC went into Warburg and ripped its guts out, announcing
a 10% cut in the headcount across the newly merged group. At the time, this
seemed to many to be a shakeout that would rattle the firm to pieces. However,
by being totally frank, the Swiss house was able to reduce the uncertainty
and keep both sides of the franchise: SBC's trading capabilities in foreign
exchange, bonds and derivatives, and Warburg's prestigious name and giant
presence in corporate finance. <BR>
<BR>
While SBC Warburg did lose several high-profile corporate clients - specifically
Halifax - many have returned, new business has been generated and the firm
has retained its position in advisory and broking. The Cassandras should
have known better. SBC's track record in buying firms that fit is second
to none. When the firm bought the Chicago-based derivatives house O'Connor
in 1992, the culture and senior staff of that operation rapidly became that
of sbc itself. The same goes for the purchase of fund management operation
Brinson. Now SBC Warburg is a super-bank, and the status this confers in
terms of client respect and capability means the firm gives its competitors
sleepless nights. <HR>
<H2><A NAME="equityresearch"></A>International equity research house </H2>
<H3>Merrill Lynch </H3>
It is probably too early to judge who will win the race to achieve global
equity research coverage. Will it be the firms that have large numbers of
staff on the ground or will it be those that divide the world into industrial
sectors and look at it on a pan-international basis? Merrill Lynch provides
the best example of a firm that applies both principles, and it has successfully
transformed its equity research capabilities in a very short period. <BR>
<BR>
The firm has 260 analysts globally, covering 3,000 stocks and 50 countries
out of 22 locations. Interestingly, there are now more analysts in London
than in the US, particularly since Smith New Court's teams were brought
on board. With one of the largest research budgets, around $200 million,
it has one of the lowest research-to-revenue budgets. It is attempting to
globalize its research product, a factor that will emerge as one of the
firm's biggest competitive advantages. Merrill has identified around 20
industries amenable to being analyzed on a global basis and is beginning
with the first six in July. Another factor that differentiates Merrill is
that its analysts are independent, and this is not just a nominal independence.
No deals can be done within the company without the express backing of analysts:
they can - and do - kill deals. <BR>
<BR>
In the future, it will be interesting to see how the Smith New Court analysts
are integrated, as more than half of them are looking at the UK. Three disparate
approaches - UK equities, pan-European sectoral research and country research
- have to be integrated. The same goes for FG in Madrid and Davis Borkum
Hare in South Africa. It will be several years before any house manages
to globalize its research fully, but Merrill is well on its way. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Top tier</B> <I>Morgan Stanley</I> Morgan Stanley is well down the route
to globalized sectoral research, so its analysts can look at industry sectors
in a way that appeals to global investors. It is, as yet, a niche product
but may pay off in the future. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Top tier</B> <I>SBCWarburg</I> SBC Warburg's huge equity research department,
with 278 analysts tracking 3,330 companies, is very highly regarded by its
peers. Fewer than a quarter of its analysts are UK analysts, and a further
25% focus on European companies. <HR>
<H2><A NAME="marketresearch"></A>Emerging markets research house </H2>
<H3>SBC Warburg </H3>
For SBC Warburg in its emerging markets research efforts, presence is everything.
The research department is internationally organized, and most of the analysts
are members of cross-border international sector teams in addition to being
local analysts. This gives the firm an edge on cross-border valuation techniques
within industries such as banks, energy, mining, telecoms and utilities.
<BR>
<BR>
The emerging markets research team is determined to produce research as
good as its developed market product, and this shows. One of the areas in
which the SBC Warburg research approach is best replicated in the emerging
markets is in the firm's Asian research. Around 25% of SBC Warburg's 278-strong
analysts team are based around the Pacific rim, centred in Hong Kong. The
firm steals a march on its competitors in its Asian credit research, which
is second to none. <BR>
<BR>
Over the past year, sbcw has increased its commitment to its research effort.
Specialist country analysts have been added in 10 countries, including the
acquisition of JD Anderson in South Africa. The firm has also begun a branded
global emerging market equity publication covering strategy, applying techniques
of valuation used by the developed markets teams and newly formulated methods
of valuation especially developed for emerging markets. This product is
being reinforced by weekly technical analysis in emerging markets. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Top tier</B> <I>ING Barings</I> ING Barings has a formidable reputation
in research in Asia and other emerging markets, with huge resources dedicated
to on-the-ground research. However, the loss of the firms' Latin America
research team in June has dealt a blow to the firm's prospects of maintaining
outstanding performance in research. <BR>
<BR>
<B>One to watch</B> <I>Citibank</I> Citibank's emerging market currency
outlook is a top-notch product, and as Citi puts its emerging market equity
research into gear, it will soon become formidable across the board. <HR>

With this award, <I>Euromoney</I> is striving to recognize firms that provide
excellence in secondary market equity activity. To a large extent this award
is measured on intangibles such as the quality and scale, and success of
a firm's equity franchise. <BR>
<BR>
Merrill Lynch has the highest market share of a domestic firm in the US,
and more recently in the UK, since the purchase of Smith New Court. In other
markets it is either the leader or among the top three non-domestic players.
It has a broader coverage of clients than many of its competitors - especially
in the number of institutions it covers. The value it adds for its customers
is in terms of its market knowledge, product knowledge, top-quality execution
and private client distribution. <BR>
<BR>
In the battleground of continental Europe, where it is harder to judge how
different houses rate, Merrill is a key player in all markets. It has brought
an excellent research and trading operation to the party, and is particularly
adept at block trades. Merrill is also positioned to become the broking
firm of the future, which is likely to be one that can help institutional
clients with the development of their risk profile and, at the same time,
execute deals. Already, the firm has been hired as a consultant to a UK
retail company pension fund to rejig its asset allocation. Taking risk only
to facilitate customer transactions is already a hallmark of the firm.<B>

and equity-related products fully and is a market-maker in many large stocks,

programme trading and restructuring pension funds (such as the $10 billion
restructuring of the State of Connecticut pension fund). <BR>

<H3>FRONT END</H3>
<p>
<H2>Go Johnny go, go go </H2>
<p>
<font size=3>
It's the end of an era at Merrill Lynch. John McNiven, the firm's colourful
co-head of global debt markets in London and arguably the most successful
debt market professional of the 1990s, is<BR>
heading east to Hong Kong, to become co-head of Asian investment banking.
<BR>
<BR>
McNiven's London replacement will be Anders Bergendahl, most recently head
of relationship management and business origination in the investment banking
group. <BR>
<BR>
It's a tough act to follow. McNiven, an ebullient Australian who drives
a Rolls-Royce sporting the number plate MC NIV, joined the firm in 1988
from JP Morgan, along with six others, at a time when Merrill languished
in 21st place in the Euromarket league table. But it topped the table in
1994 and has been there ever since. <BR>
<BR>
McNiven established a reputation as a straight-talking, innovative debt
market practitioner. <BR>
<BR>
According to one colleague: &quot;Tales about John are far too many to recount.&quot;
One story concerns the run-up to McNiven's wedding a few years ago. The
firm had for some time been chasing a big deal in the Ecu market, where
it had won few mandates. So one syndicate staffer got hold of the treasurer
of a major Euromarket borrower just two days before the wedding and persuaded
him to call McNiven. This treasurer duly informed McNiven that, while he
wanted to do the deal with Merrill, he was having trouble convincing his
senior management that, given Merrill's record in Ecu, they would be able
to carry it off successfully. McNiven's presence the next day at his offices
(some 3,000 miles away) would ensure that Merrill collected its prized mandate.
<BR>
<BR>
McNiven, putting his firm before his fianc&eacute;e, was all set to make
the flight when the jokers revealed the plot (but not before the future
Mrs McNiven had phoned the treasurer to tell him that John was on the plane
and he had ruined the most important day of her life). <BR>
<BR>
Anders Bergendahl is a very different character. He joined the firm in 1977
and has spent his career in the investment banking division. <BR>
<BR>
He is perhaps best known for his part in building up Merrill's Scandinavian
debt business in the difficult days of the mid-1980s, when the Nordic region
became probably the firm's most important client franchise area. <P ALIGN="RIGHT"><B>Clive

The young girl who started as a telex operator at Salomon Brothers in London
and rose to become a director and head of fixed-income research, Valerie
Thompson, has always been a figure in Euromarket folklore. Now she has written
a book. <BR>
<BR>
The bad news for the<BR>
vivacious Thompson's many admirers is that it isn't an auto-biography with
dark &quot;kiss 'n' tell&quot; stories, or the key to why Salomon managing
directors sent over from New York seem to have such a short shelf life in
London. <I>Mastering the Euromarkets</I> is serious - a handbook for practitioners
in the international bond markets. <BR>
<BR>
The book is a fascinating read. Its strength lies in its clarity and the
straightforward approach it takes to questions which young practitioners
are too timid to ask. The bond maths is particularly well presented, perhaps
a reflection of the difficulties Thompson herself found with complex formulae.
<BR>
<BR>
A former Salomon managing director said: &quot;Deryck Maughan and Warren
Buffett will probably take 1,500 copies for Salomon traders, just for the
comments on avoiding disasters.&quot; <B>Ian Kerr</B>

Some German banks made Herculean efforts to get on the Deutsche Telekom
issuing<BR>
syndicate, but Schr&ouml;der M&uuml;nchmeyer Hengst (SMH) was included without
making a single trip to Bonn, or lunching with a single finance ministry
official. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We made no attempt at all to get this business,&quot; says an amused
Klaus Bert, one of the managing partners at the investment house and private
bank owned by the Lloyds Bank Group, &quot;It just fell into our lap.&quot;
As <I>Euromoney</I> reported last month, SMH is the only German house with
an underwriting<BR>
capability that did not seek a role in the syndicate. <BR>
<BR>
The bank prefers to be able to give independent investment advice to its
clients than to earn modest fees. &quot;We are sticking to our policy of
non-participation in underwriting syndicates,&quot; says Eberhard Weiersh&auml;user,
the managing partner who heads SMH's treasury business. <BR>
<BR>
Thus Weiersh&auml;user and his partners were caught unawares when Deutsche
Telekom publicly announced SMH's appointment as a co-manager. Later, a letter
arrived. &quot;We hope you will appreciate that because of the huge public
interest, we have informed the media of our<BR>
decision without discussing the structure of the syndicate with you beforehand,&quot;
wrote Telekom finance director Joachim Kr&ouml;ske. <BR>
<BR>
Eberhard Rolle, a senior official at the finance ministry in Bonn, argues
that SMH had not ruled itself out of being in the consortium, however. &quot;I
couldn't exclude any banks without laying myself open to attack. But I'm
not obliging anyone to accept our invitation.&quot; <BR>

Weierha&uuml;ser, a public advocate of privatization, knows life isn't that
simple. &quot;This privatization is a challenge to the entire nation, that's
the problem,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
So will SMH be accepting Telekom's offer? At the time of going to press
Weierh&auml;user was saying: &quot;That depends on the terms of the deal
and how much freedom we have to publish <BR>
independent research.&quot; <P ALIGN="RIGHT"><B>Laura Covill</B> 
<H3>Japan's bulletproof bankers wear blazers </H3>
Why do some Japanese bankers appear so stiff in public? Maybe it's their
vests. <BR>
<BR>
Japanese makers of bulletproof vests, which used to be almost exclusively
worn by cash-delivery guards, report a surge in sales to executives of banks
and other financial services. Especially popular, according to Shoichiro
Takahashi of Toa Security, is a new bullet-and-knife-proof &quot;blazer&quot;
available in six different materials, including Italian<BR>
cashmere, which, worn with its removable armoured panels, weighs only two
kilos. Cost? A mere &#165;200,000 ($1,923). The blazer is &quot;unique&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
The traditional armoured undershirt causes sweating, and the bulletproof
leather jacket, which Toa Security also sells, makes the wearer look like
a member of the Russian mafia. Since the Japanese naturally expect bankers
to seize every opportunity to play golf, the blazer is a perfect shield
for those haunted by the fear of assassination on the golf course. <BR>
<BR>
Understandably, Takahashi declines to reveal the names of his banking customers.
&quot;If it is known they are wearing body armour, assailants will shoot
them in the head,&quot; he explains. <BR>
<BR>
The spread of illegal handguns in Japan, and a spate of sensational violent
crimes, has led to widespread unease. Dai-Tokyo Fire &amp; Marine Insurance
last year surveyed its staff on their sense of security and found that 51%
lived in fear of being knifed or shot. (No such case has yet occurred, a
Dai-Tokyo spokesman says.) <BR>
<BR>
Bankers feel the risk more acutely because so many of their bad loans involve
the yakuza, Japan's gangsters. Between 1992 and 1995 police investigated
40 reported attacks by yakuza on financial institutions or companies involved
in bad loans. <P ALIGN="RIGHT"><B>Peter McGill</B> 
<H3>MTN stars ain't cheap </H3>
There was some surprise when Sumitomo Finance snapped up Bruce Cairnduff,
its new executive director of MTN origination and trading. Cairnduff arrived
from Lehman Brothers, one of the MTN business's major players - unlike Sumitomo,
which ranks nowhere. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In the short term I want to make Sumitomo the most successful Japanese
MTN house,&quot; he says. &quot;In the long term I want Goldman and Lehman
looking over their shoulders.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Of course, apart from the thrill of building a business from scratch, there
is another reason for the MTN star's parachuting out of Lehman. Sumitomo
apparently told those shortlisted that when it made them an offer, it would
be impossible to refuse because it would resemble an international telephone
number. <BR>
<BR>
Green-faced traders estimate that his salary and bonus will be two or three
times the market average - around $2.5 million over three years. <BR>
<BR>
But Sumitomo wanted the best, and Cairnduff is high-profile. Among other
things he was instrumental in establishing the MTN market practices committee
affiliated to IPMA. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I would have thought it would have been someone old and grey, looking
for retirement money,&quot; says one trader surprised at the move. &quot;But
maybe he knows something about Lehman we don't.&quot; Another adds: &quot;Maybe
Lehman should stop oiling their revolving doors.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Cairnduff will report to Mike Thoms, who joined from Bankers Trust, and
whose credit and asset swap team he describes as one of the best in the
market. &quot;They'll invent the credit derivatives and I can throw them
into the MTNs,&quot; he says. <P ALIGN="RIGHT"><B>Steven Irvine</B> 
<H3>Chase's Indiana Lynch </H3>
What better way to escape the Chase Chemical merger than to don a leather
jacket, and an Indiana Jones hat to solve one of Brazil's most enduring
mysteries. <BR>
<BR>
James Lynch, director of corporate restructuring at Chase Manhattan in Brazil,
is on the trail of an English explorer, Percy Fawcett, who disappeared in
the Amazon jungle 71 years ago. <BR>
<BR>
Fawcett wrote his last known letter from Dead Horse Camp. Then he disappeared.
A mining engineer claimed to have met Fawcett in 1927. According to him,
the explorer was &quot;living with the natives&quot; and had rejected European
society.<BR>
Similar sightings have continued, right up to the present: Lynch has had
calls from people who swear Fawcett is still - at 130 - alive and well.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The odds are that Fawcett got into trouble with one of the tribes
and was killed,&quot; says Lynch. &quot;But that's one reason for going
- to find out.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Lynch plans to talk with various tribes on the way - many of whom are known
for their &quot;secrecy and savagery&quot; - including the Calapalo, who
once told anthropologists they had killed Fawcett because they suspected
he was a gold prospector. <BR>
<BR>
Lynch says that &quot;to get there we have to make a four-day trek through
the jungle&quot;. <P ALIGN="RIGHT"><B>Dylan Drummond</B>

<H3>FINANCIAL LAWYER </H3>
<H2>Ringing the changes on BT</h2>
<h4>
The wave of privatizations over the last 15 years has spawned new types
of legal structure - and specialist lawyers to apply them. By Christopher
Stoakes </H4>
Privatization in the 1980s was characterized by the initial public offering
(IPO) with a simultaneous listing on several stock exchanges worldwide.
The privatization of British Telecommunications (BT) in 1984 was held up
as the classic IPO. <BR>
<BR>
Privatization in the 1990s has broadened, with a wider array of legal techniques
employed. Two variants are the trade sale and the voucher scheme. The trade
sale suits the disposal of well-established state-owned entities which are
sufficiently small and specialist not to merit an IPO. It is characteristic
of the second wave of privatizations in the west. The voucher scheme is
used in developing markets such as central and eastern Europe where there
is an insufficiently developed market economy to make an IPO possible. <BR>
<BR>
Lawyers play a crucial role in establishing the structure best suited to
avoiding possible conflicts with the privatizing state's policy objectives.
The state's reasons for privatizing may include raising money for the government,
attracting new investment into the sector, introducing profit motivation
into business as a matter of principle and increasing consumer benefit through
competition. <BR>
<BR>
<B>T</B>hese objectives can conflict. &quot;For example, if you introduce
competition into a sector, you may reduce what a buyer will pay for what
was a monopoly,&quot; says Patrick Wallace, a partner at Freshfields, a
leading law firm for privatizations internationally. &quot;If you introduce
unmodified private-sector disciplines, you can sometimes put consumer prices
up where cross-subsidies have been encouraged for social-policy reasons.&quot;
In the latter case, an unprofitable service can be transferred to the private
sector along with a government grant which covers the additional cost of
providing the required service. The bidder prepared to provide the service
for the lowest subsidy wins the tender. <BR>
<BR>
A similar approach was used in the privatization of the UK electricity industry.
The government wanted, as a matter of policy, to foster renewable and nuclear
energy sources. Since electricity is relatively expensive to produce using
these generation methods, suppliers using them might not have survived in
the new free market. &quot;This policy conflict was successfully avoided
by careful choice of privatization structure,&quot; says Wallace, whose
firm advised PowerGen and Scottish Power during the restructuring and subsequent
privatization of the UK electricity industry. &quot;As part of the privatization,
legislation required all electricity producers to charge a levy on customers
and pay it to approved producers of nuclear and renewable electricity. The
sort of cross-subsidy which used to exist in the state sector was preserved
but in a way which was operationally compatible with the free market which
was introduced.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>A</B>n ongoing example of the trade sale is port privatization. There
are over a thousand ports worldwide gradually being pushed into private
management or ownership. Developing countries see port privatization as
a way of attracting investment to facilities whose modernization will contribute
to their economies by increasing trade. Privatization may stop short of
outright disposal. Commercialization is a process involving private-sector
participation in port operations - by bringing in a management company,
for example. Full privatization - transferring a port's assets and liabilities
to a new corporate vehicle which is then sold - is likely to be favoured
by interested privatesector acquirers because ports come with substantial
landholdings which can be used for development purposes and as security
for the financing. <BR>
<BR>
The complications lie in preserving for the state a measure of control.
In the classic IPO model this was achieved by reserving for the state a
golden share which effectively gave it sufficient voting strength to block
any fundamental shift in the newly privatized entity's business. In the
case of ports, the state may want control over future disposals of port
assets in order to ensure that the port will be properly maintained and
statutory obligations (for instance to maintain the harbour approaches,
to regulate ship movements within the harbour and to offer cargo-handling
services) will be discharged. Specific legislation may be required to facilitate
the transfer. The state has to be sure that if the new owner defaults in
any of these duties, it can step in. <BR>
<BR>
This right of re-acquisition has to be squared with the interests of the
financing banks, although one risk - renationalization - can never be excluded.
Crucial to the port's viability will be the amount that the new owner can
charge users. &quot;The state will want to ensure that its port continues
to be attractive to international trade so, to avoid overpricing, the state
may regulate the amount of port dues which a buyer can charge port users,&quot;
says Christoper Tite, a partner at Stephenson Harwood, who has advised on
port privatizations internationally. <BR>
<BR>
If the trade sale is an emanation of good old-fashioned M&amp;A, the voucher
scheme has its roots in investment management. In Poland, a mass-privatization
programme involving 400-odd companies was implemented in mid-1995. The model
adopted was that of the typical institutional investor, which has a handful
of large core holdings and a larger number of smaller ones. In Poland, 15
national investment funds (NIFs) were created, each managed by a local fund
manager in partnership with a western bank or investment management company.
Each of the 400 companies has one NIF as principal shareholder with 30%,
the state holds 30% and the remaining 40% is distributed amongst the other
NIFs. <BR>
<BR>
<B>I</B>n this way each NIF has a small number of core shareholdings which
it is expected to actively manage. In order to create ownership, each of
Poland's 27 million adults was given the right to buy a voucher from savings
bank PKO/BP. The voucher entitles the holder to a share in each of the NIFs.
Until NIFs become listed, these shares remain illiquid. NIFs do not themselves
have capital to inject into their investments, hence the tag &quot;nominal
privatization&quot; used to describe this technique of removing com-panies
from state control without a fresh injection of capital. Fund managers can
overcome this by raising capital internationally and setting up parallel
cash funds which can take up new issues of equity by the companies that
the NIFs are unable to through lack of capital. <BR>
<BR>
Ironically, privatization can provide lawyers with new areas of specialization.
One such is telecoms law, spurred on by BT's privatization. State telecoms
operators are what economists call &quot;natural monopolies&quot;. Once
a fixed network is in place, it makes no sense for a competitor new to the
market to try to build a rival one. For lawyers the challenge lies in constructing
a regulatory regime to ensure a level playing field. This is one of the
reasons for the present wrangling between BT and the FINANCIAL LAWYER's
telecoms watchdog, Oftel, with - no surprise - lawyers ever present behind
the scenes.<p>

<H2>The lure of high-yield fusion</H2>
<H4>
Jean-Claude Komarovsky hears a mating call in the high Alps and meets an
old friend from California. </H4>
On the Gornergrat, beneath the shadow of the Matterhorn, a bleat on the
mobile. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is Franz in Vienna.&quot; He's in a lather about someone in Switzerland.
&quot;It might have been a Swede, his German was so bad,&quot; says Franz.
I hear him crack his knuckles as he paces his vast office and rants through
the squawk-box. &quot;Will these amateurs never learn? An Anschluss is a
two-sided affair.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
It seems this person, claiming to be prime minister, was suggesting a merger.
&quot;One experience with that Bavarian clown was enough!&quot; rages Franz.
<BR>
<BR>
I try to calm him. Actually the proposal's not such a bad idea, I say. There
are many synergies and economies of scale in cowbell manufacture, Alpenstocks
and Lederhosen; the combined retail power of Sachertorte and Toblerone,
Viennese waltzes accompanied on the Alpenhorn. Liechtenstein could be the
regional HQ. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You don't understand, Komarovsky. This guy is after my job. I can
smell it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You think you'll have one after 1999? Look Franz, this man has seen
the writing on the wall. When the euro arrives, the Swiss franc is finished.
Since his people have more chance of developing a sense of humour than voting
to join the EU he thinks maybe he cross-fertilizes with you, and he'll take
them through the back door. You should be flattered.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I didn't get that impression. He said my outfit is fat and lazy and
doesn't deserve its triple A rating. He said we can't even get rid of our
second-biggest bank, Credit Untstuck, which I agreed was fair comment but,
not a justification to give up our sovereignty. Look what happened to SG
Warberks.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;But he's right. What you need is an Austro-Helvetian axis. You want
Helmut, Jacques, John (or maybe Tony) and this new guy Romano calling all
the shots?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm thinking about it,&quot; Franz growls. &quot;Look Jean-Claude
...&quot;. Here we go. Whenever Vranitzky uses my first name he's asking
a favour. &quot;... go and see this guy. Tell me what he's up to.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
I settle down to read the folkloric menu at the Baur au Lac: 
<P><CENTER><I>Monsieur Gut vous propose:</I> <BR>

Banque surprise m&acirc;itre d'Ospel </CENTER>
<P>But before I can even wrist-fax the office for a translation I get an
urgent incoming call. It seems the firm is embarked on what our head of
global focus, JJ Ingersoll, calls operation Sea-Lion or was it Barbarossa,
and I'm needed to help lead a charm offensive against the republic of Vodka's
new and mysterious head of borrowing. <BR>
<BR>
We land in Smirnovia, on the Baltic, at which point JJ falls back on first
principles, and like the trained professional he is, tells the customs officer
of the firm's capabilities and its ability to distribute product. But the
guy just says &quot;Do you have any papers&quot;, to which JJ looks him
in the eye and replies &quot;No, our last issue basically flew out the window.
But I've got some bonds under my desk that I was keeping for my kid's college
fund. You'll have to bid above par to get them.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You must be selling snake oil,&quot; says a man in a long black leather
coat with a patch over his right eye, appearing from nowhere. &quot;I checkmate
using the Najdorf variation,&quot; replies JJ, puzzling the hell out of
me. We step into a car. Five minutes later we're slipping round the coast
in a Latvian fishing trawler. We arrive at a port where a small black helicopter
transports us 100 miles inland to a secret destination, with a sign &quot;No
MTNs allowed&quot; above the door. <BR>
<BR>
It's not the usual civil service building. In fact it's an artificial volcano,
and inside there are sirens blaring, and a couple of secret agents being
shot while trying to escape. It reminds me a little of Finland during the
banking crisis. I hear the words COUNTDOWN TO LAUNCH NOW COMMENCING and
wonder which firm has the global presence to pull off a bond issue that
requires a false volcano as part of its infrastucture, and why we haven't
got one. <BR>
<BR>
JJ, normally-speaking a fat hot-dog of a man, is more alert than usual and
appears to have found a savvy that exceeds that of simply explaining the
heavy participation of Asian central banks. <BR>
<BR>
We walk into the control room and see the back of a chair, its occupant
is watching the World Series. &quot;I'm glad you could come, gentleman,&quot;
utters a voice in perfect American. &quot;As you will appreciate, I brought
you 2,000 miles via the straits of Bohinia and through the Voshpomous in
my private helicopter to my secret lair because I have always appreciated
your firm's integrity and respect for the individual. What I am about to
tell you cannot leave this room...&quot; The chair wheels around. <BR>
<BR>
I vaguely recognise him, but it is JJ who exclaims first &quot;Mike, Mike
Milkall - what are you doing here?&quot; Our host allows a thin smile
to pass over his lips. &quot;I am Mike no longer. To you I'm Viktor the
Bear, alias Goldenjunk. Beverly Hills is a distant memory, as is Drexel
Burnem and Screwem. This is my land now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
So this is where a jail sentence and $100 million fine gets you, I think,
poor Mike. Then I remember that JJ and Milkall first swung their dicks together
on the firm's training course. JJ decided that bringing the US thrift system
to the brink of doom at a cost of $150 billion to the taxpayer was not for
him. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What can we do for you,&quot; says JJ. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We've got some junk we need to sell.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's the junk?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Global nuclear melt-down bonds,&quot; hisses Milkall, a strange gleam
in his eye. &quot;That's right. These guys have a structured refinancing
deal as solid as a sarcophagus. The hedge funds will bite our hands off
for a piece of the action. Forget TVA and its global power bonds. That's
for wimps. This could be a multi-trillion dollar market.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Hold it Milkall,&quot; snaps JJ, &quot;what sane fund manager is going
to pour money into a nuclear clean-up black hole? Where's the return, where's
the coupon stream, where's the goddamn capital protection, you flaky asshole?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Twhe normally integrated JJ smiles dangerously. But Milkall turns on the
charm. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Guys, you gotta understand something. No way is this some toxic high-risk
investment. This is more your classic structured pass-through deal. Okay,
what we're funding here are massive high-density lead and concrete shelters
with a projected half-life of 500 years. But there's a ton of soft credits
and multilateral grants behind this stuff. The west can't leave nuclear
time-bombs ticking all around its next big export market. The multinationals
can't afford to take 150 million consumers out of the market.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Milkall warms to his theme. &quot;With the meltdown exposure contained,
imagine, these towns and factories can keep producing all kinds of junk
goods real cheap because of low energy costs. And the cashflow's yours.
Here you have a huge yield pick up on what is basically Uncle Sam risk.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
I glance across at JJ who's already punching figures into a spreadsheet
on his pocket computer and muttering: &quot;Those sappy environmental funds
in California...those money market funds in Boston ain't sniffed any yield
all year...the government of Singapore for half a billion... Jorge Sore-ass
will want a whole bundle.&quot; Suddenly JJ remembers his deep respect for
the customer whose interest always comes first. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Milkall, baby, these meltdown bonds are going to be hot!&quot; shouts
JJ. But suddenly he looks all anxious. &quot;You think you have enough inventory?&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;JJ, this is just the beginning.&quot; <BR>

<H3>REVIEW</H3>
<H2>Empty trust fund </H2>
<H4>Trust: The social virtues and the creation of prosperity </H4>
<B>By Francis Fukuyama <BR>
Hamish Hamilton, &#163;25<BR>
The Free Press, $24.95 <BR>
<BR>
Reviewed by Susan Greenberg</B><BR>
<BR>
I approached this book with a distinct lack of trust, after the hype surrounding
Fukuyama's last work <I>The End of History</I>. In that much-debated work
the author made himself hostage to fortune by positing the triumphalist
and somewhat contrived argument that history had &quot;ended&quot; with
the Cold War. History was taken as narrowly defined by the dialectian Hegel
and by Karl Marx: the difference was that it had ended not with proletarian
revolution but the triumph of liberal democracy and along with it the market
economy. <BR>
<BR>
The new book provides further proof of Fukuyama's ability to tap popular
concerns. These days everyone is rediscovering trust, one of those things
you thought were common sense. Management theorist Charles Handy recently
sounded a public alert with an article on the subject in the <I>Harvard
Business Review</I>. Behind the scenes, US academic projects reflect a new
preoccupation with culture and &quot;social capital&quot; and a general
fear that the current narrow focus on economic growth is crushing the life
out of western society. Such fears also lie behind much of the hand-wringing
by recession-hit westerners over the more communitarian and prosperous Japanese
and Germans. <BR>
<BR>
Fukuyama manages to dispel some mistrust by offering a stimulating book
which rounds up new material and old debates - a quarter of the volume
is made up of footnotes - and applying his argument to a wide range
of live issues. Triumphalism has been tempered with realism about the problems
faced by some parts of the former Soviet empire. But he uses the new book
to back his old thesis, that the liberal formula is a winning one because
it permits the age-old human struggle for &quot;recognition&quot; to take
place in a more acceptable form. In other words, make money not war. <BR>
<BR>
The argument is that culture, defined here as &quot;inherited ethical habit&quot;,
pervades economic activity but is vastly underestimated in importance. More
specifically, a nation's well-being is conditioned by the cultural characteristic
of trust which in turn gives rise to &quot;social capital&quot;, a measure
of people's ability to work together for a common purpose. Fukuyama describes
in detail how this quality helps industrial development. The family, voluntary
associations and the state each have a corresponding economic organisation:
the family business, the managed corporation and the state-backed concern.
Low-trust societies such as China and France tend to have a large gap between
family and state activity, he argues, allowing either nepotism or over-centralised
control to hold back development. <BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, in their different ways the high-trust &quot;spontaneously
sociable&quot; nations such as the US, Japan and Germany have developed
an active middle layer allowing prosperous enterprises to arise. America
provides the model of a society based on the rule of transparent laws where
disparate people can cooperate, a necessary condition for the modern, managed
corporation. <BR>
<BR>
Anticipating the surprise inclusion in this dynamic trio of the US, with
its well-known individualism, Fukuyama spends much of the book explaining
why the country is more sociable and communitarian - nay conformist
- than everyone supposes. But he warns that reality is finally beginning
to match the individualist theory and reserves of trust are being exhausted
as the impersonal rule of law heads towards its unmoderated logical conclusion,
a process that could have dire consequences. As he expresses it: &quot;Past
a certain point, the <BR>
proliferation of rules to regulate wider and wider sets of social relationships
becomes not the hallmark of rational efficiency but... of social dysfunction.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
This is a polite reference to the fierce debates currently raging about
things like sexual harassment, racial entitlement and the OJ Simpson legal-media
circus. And indeed, we probably all have our horror stories about the perverse
lack of common sense that arises in America whenever you try to legislate
for every occasion. But the author says nothing new here; the strange mix
of moralism, extremism and legalism is made to a very old recipe, and has
created US crises before. <BR>
<BR>
Despite Fukuyama's efforts to be even-handed about the left and right it
is the left's sympathy to multiculturalism - in its extreme form, the
argument that the United States should not have a dominant culture at all
- which attracts the brunt of his criticism. But in present-day America
it is the radical right which is taking individualistic selfishness to the
sort of extremes which could endanger the state: viz the Oklahoma bombing
and anti-fed gun enthusiasts. Even more worrying, many senior US politicians
have been slow to draw the line between acceptable &quot;small government&quot;
and individualism gone mad. This book might give the debate a new economic
twist.<BR>

<H4>Strategic Survey 1994-5 </H4>

As an example of getting it wrong, the following passage is a 24-carat example.
&quot;The strains that had developed between Knin and Belgrade may have
led President Tudjman to the dangerously erroneous conclusion that Milosevic
would refrain from intervening in a renewed war between Croatia and the
[Serb areas of Croatia]. There is in fact precious little evidence to suggest
that the Yugoslav Army would remain passive if a large-scale attack was
launched against Krajina. Moreover, the Krajina Serbs could count on the
support of fellow Serbs in neighbouring Bosnia...&quot; <BR>
<BR>
For anyone who read a newspaper this summer detailing Croatia's destruction
of the Krajina republic's heartland around Knin and the passive response
of Serbs in both Bosnia and the motherland, the errors are all too plain.
So is there any point at all in purchasing these think-tank tomes? <BR>
<BR>
Like all surveys of the future (other than those written by the likes of
Nostradamus who cleverly employed the vaguest language), the IISS Strategic
Survey lays itself open such finger-pointing judgements. How could it be
otherwise? The book is published early in the year and then sits around
waiting for reviewers to take cheap shots. At best, the entire exercise
could be seen as a fine example of collective courage from a respected institution
willing to lay its reputation on the line. At worst, it is a waste of rainforest.
<BR>
<BR>
But there is another side to the argument and it goes something like this:
only a fool expects every word of a survey to be accurate. Leaf through
newspapers and there are howlers aplenty from the previous day. Even the
best surveys fall prey to error but they offer a valuable overview, not
only of the future but also the immediate past. <BR>
<BR>
This passage refers to last year: &quot;The world appeared to be marking
time, while many of the positive advances that had been made since the end
of the bipolar geopolitics that had dominated the past 45 years receded.
All too often, the question was: who is in charge? And no answer came back.
Nation states, as the world has known them for centuries, are facing a crisis
of governance. In most countries... weak leaders are balanced uncomfortably
atop shaky governments. Busy looking over their shoulders at disgruntled
electorates, or under attack from rebellions of the left and right, they
have little time or inclination for strong or positive initiatives in foreign
affairs.&quot; Well-written and with a truly global perspective, this kind
of writing is thought-provoking in a way which newspapers and other media
sources rarely attempt. The survey also has plenty for detail fanatics,
with sections on individual regions and global problems like the smuggling
of nuclear material and cross-border crime. <BR>
<BR>
This is both a useful reference book and an aid to identifying trends. Intelligent
readers should use the information provided to make their own judgements.
What it is not is a guide to what will happen on the planet over the following
12 months. If you want that, refer back to Nostradamus' <I>Centuries </I>and
try to work it out for yourself. <BR>

<H3>DRAGONS' TEETH </H3>
<H4>Black Sea </H4>
<B>By Neal Ascherson<BR>
Jonathan Cape, &#163;17.99 <BR>
<BR>
Reviewed by Adrian Murdoch</B>B> </B><BR>
<BR>
What does it mean to be a people or a <I>Volk</I>? What do the words nation
and culture mean? What is barbarism and what is civilisation? These are
the questions Neal Ascherson asks of the seeming chaotic milieu living on
the shores of the Black Sea. <BR>
<BR>
It is an area with which Ascherson, best known for his writings on contemporary
Poland, has a personal connection. His father was a midshipman on a British
battleship that evacuated the defeated Cossacks of the White Army from the
port of Novorossisk in 1920. And Ascherson was in the Crimea to witness
the collapse of the coup against the then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
in 1991. These two events are the bookends between which Ascherson examines
the history, economics, archaeology, sociology and even ecology of this
ethnically mixed area. <BR>
<BR>
As might be expected, the ghost of the ancient Greek writer Herodotos pervades
every aspect of <I>Black Sea</I>. In the fifth century BC, Herodotos' <I>Histories</I>
examined many of the themes that interest Ascherson now. But along with
the subject matter, the non-linear narrative style itself, full of <I>digressiones,</I>
also consciously apes the author commonly referred to as the Father of History.
Ascherson details the minutiae of Black Sea society in this vein, so that
a ring inscribed with the name Scyles found at the mouth of the Danube broadens
into the story of the prince of the same name who tried to keep his Scythian
identity and absorb Greekness at the same time, found it too much to bear
and was torn apart, both physically and mentally. <BR>
<BR>
This friction between civilisation and barbarism leads to a discussion of
what we understand by these terms: how the term barbarism has come full
circle from being an onomatopoeic Greek word for non-Greek speakers (literally
&quot;bar-bar speakers&quot;) to a term for inferior otherness and then,
thanks to the romantics and their concept of the noble savage, something
pure that lies in pure contrast with modern, decadent society. Indeed, this
debate takes up much of the book, with Ascherson arguing that the pejorative
definition of barbarism was a concept devised by Athenian intellectuals
to claim political supremacy. Here he holds up the Greek playwrights Aeschylus
and Euripides as the first cultural imperialists who lumped the rest of
the world - from the civilised Persians to nomadic northern tribes
- under the blanket of barbarism, which for them meant anything as
far away from the Greek ideal as possible. <BR>
<BR>
This leads naturally to a discussion about the more extreme concepts of
nationalism that arose in late 19th and early 20th century Europe, including
Polish nationalism as preached by its national poet Adam Mickiewicz. &quot;Homogeneity
- one language, one religion, one <I>Volk</I> - was considered
the prerequisite of a strong and independent state. It followed that nothing
could be more offensive to this scientific spirit, with its blind drive
to categorise and segregate, than the multi-ethnic, decentralised and in
certain ways tolerant Ottoman empire,&quot; says Ascherson, in this case
referring to Kemalism in Turkey. <BR>
<BR>
But how to reconcile nationalism with other forms of identity such as culture?
Scyles could well be a metaphor for many of the people around the sea's
shores. Ascherson lovingly chronicles the area's forgotten and dying languages
like Ubykh - the last speaker died in 1992 - and attempts to keep
the Lazuri language alive. <BR>
<BR>
In trying to resuscitate the latter, he says, the middle-aged German intellectual
Wolfgang Feurstein is essentially creating a modern nation out of folk culture,
a process that has kept central and eastern Europe in ferment for the last
200 years. Ascherson argues that by writing this spoken language down, Feurstein
is canonising the Lazi culture and driving a wedge between their own and
the Turkish culture into which they are assimilated. &quot;Cadmus, first
king of Thebes, brought the alphabet to Greece. But he also planted dragons'
teeth, which sprouted into a crop of armed men,&quot; he notes. <BR>
<BR>
Early on in <I>Black Sea</I> Ascherson asks, quoting the modern Greek poet
Cavafy: &quot;Now what is going to happen to us without the barbarians?
Those people were a kind of solution.&quot; Perhaps it would have been more
in tune with contemporary society for Ascherson to cite the previous verse:
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Because night has fallen and the <BR>
<BR>
barbarians haven't come. <BR>
<BR>
And some of our men just in from the</I> <BR>
<BR>
<I>border say <BR>
<BR>
There are no barbarians any longer.</I><BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%><BR><BR>
Did you know that the term &quot;Bohemian&quot; arose as a description of
unconventional types because Romanies or gypsies first travelled from the
east to western Europe in the 15th century with letters of introduction
from Sigismund, King of Bohemia? <BR>
<BR>
This is one of many satisfying nuggets one can find in &quot;The Penguin
Atlas of Diasporas&quot; by G&eacute;rard Chaliand and Jean-Pierre Rageau
(Viking/Penguin, $34.95 or &#163;20), a deceptively small book packed with
maps and pictures. We also learn that the Greek word diaspora was used by
Thucydides to describe exile after the Peloponnesian War. <BR>
<BR>
The authors ask why we speak of diaspora for some people and migration for
others - no one refers to the diaspora of Britons in their former colonies.
The answer is a definition that raises even more questions: the bottom line,
besides numbers and identity, is a &quot;desire to endure&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The downside is that such groups tend to meet persecution in the host country
as symbols of the frightening Other. On the plus side, the authors argue
somewhat glibly, dynamic diasporas &quot;had a head start on the globalisation...
that has occurred with the industrial age&quot;. Well, that is all right
then. <BR>
<BR>
The definition allows them to include less conventional groups such as Afro-Americans
along with Jews, Romanies, Irish, Chinese, Indians, Greeks, Lebanese, Palestinians,
Koreans and Vietnamese. <BR>
<BR>
The long-nomadic Romanies are a natural subject for this book since it is,
as the authors write, &quot;their very state of dispersion that makes gypsies
gypsies&quot;. But the bulk of the work is absorbed by that group whose
biblical expulsion and later wanderings became synonymous with the very
term diaspora, the Jews. <BR>
<BR>
Maps show each wave of dispersion, from Babylonian captivity in 587 BC and
Christian expulsions in the Middle Ages to the 20th century return to Israel.
They remind us of the shifts of time: evoking a moment, for example, when
Islam was a haven for its semitic cousins.<p>

<H3>FINANCIAL LAWYER </h3>

<h4>Asking leading questionsAlthough the law on what a lead manager can and
cannot say about the success of a bond issue is reasonably settled, it still
causes banks and, in particular, their compliance officers, difficulties
in practice.</h4>
<b>By Christopher Stoakes </b><br><br>
Most bond issues in the Euromarkets are subject to English law: the majority
are written under English law or are underwritten and marketed in London;
some may be listed on the London Stock Exchange; a smaller proportion are
by UK issuers but listed elsewhere, such as Luxembourg. For these reasons
and because of the sophistication of the Euromarkets, English law has so
far led other European jurisdictions on this subject. By and large, any
lead manager that complies with English law should be safe as far as any
other European jurisdiction is concerned. <BR>
<BR>
Section 47 of the Financial Services Act 1986 (FSA) is the starting point.
It contains two prohibitions: (1) against making a statement, promise or
forecast which is false, misleading or deceptive in order to induce someone
to buy or sell a security or not to do so; and (2) against doing anything
which creates a false or misleading impression about the state of the market
in respect of a security in order to induce someone to buy or sell it or
not to do so. <BR>
<BR>
The first prohibition contains more of a subjective test: what was your
intent in making the statement? (By the way, it also covers concealing material
information.) In legal terms, you have to have mens rea. A criminal act,
say murder, requires both the actus reus (sticking in the knife) and mens
rea (wanting to kill the person). In the case of murder you can still be
guilty if you were reckless as to whether you killed the victim, ie didn't
really care what the effect of the stabbing would be. Under section 47,
you can be guilty under (1) above if you are reckless. <BR>
<BR>
The second prohibition contains more of an objective test. It isn't so much
what you intended, but what effect your actions had on others. This could,
in practice, be problematic. How do you know how others might interpret
what you do? Because of this, there is a defence that you reasonably believed
that your conduct would not create a false or misleading impression. <BR>
<BR>
One question prompted by section 47 when first enacted was whether it created
a substantive obligation to disclose information. Certainly, if you are
obliged under the listing rules or the Takeover Code, or even as a matter
of market practice, to make a disclosure, section 47 makes failure to do
so a criminal offence. But for a while there was a view - the &quot;strict&quot;
view - that it created an obligation in its own right to make announcements
whenever there was a risk of misleading or creating a false market. This
is not the view generally taken now. But at the time there was anxiety over
its extent: if a broker put out a piece of research which was completely
wrong, did the company or its advisers have to go around correcting it?
And in a market like the bond market where many issues are not listed, what
is the mechanism for publicizing information - is it enough to publish
it through Reuters, for example, on the assumption that most people have
access to a Reuters screen? The London Stock Exchange has helped by framing
some of its rules to be consistent with the less onerous interpretation
of section 47, but on occasion the shadow of section 47 does prompt disclosure.
For instance, it is customary to announce the results of an issue after
the rump has been placed in the market. But in some issues where the overhang
of paper is large, the lead manager may make an announcement before the
placing stage in order to protect himself from potential section 47 problems.
<BR>
<BR>
There is a different aspect of English law - contained in the Criminal
Justice Act 1993 - which causes problems: insider dealing. The test
is whether someone is dealing in the market with knowledge of matters which
are not public. The problem here is how a lead manager can deal in the market
while knowing how well an issue has gone. Fortunately, the insider dealing
offences can only be committed by an individual, not a firm, so by separating
- with an effective Chinese wall - those who are trading (dealing
with clients) from those who are selling down the book (with knowledge of
how well or badly the issue has gone) a house can be reasonably safe: the
only information the latter have is with respect to the particular issue,
in which case the defence of using that information to facilitate the transaction
concerned (as the legislation puts it) can be invoked. <BR>
<BR>
But if, following the closing, the lead manager is left with surplus paper
and wants to sell it in normal trading when the price is abnormally high,
it takes just one person to tell an institutional buyer &quot;we've got
the whole issue away successfully&quot;, to trigger section 47 - and
possibly land the lead manager with a civil action. The answer, in this
case, is: make sure all your traders say no more than &quot;the issue has
been completed&quot;. The test is: if the information were known, would
the price be lower? If the answer is yes, be careful. Market-makers are
virtually exempt from these strictures. Not all issues have markets made
in them; although in London, it is a condition of listing. <BR>
<BR>
Finally, stabilization is one aspect of market manipulation that is sanctioned
by the law. Stabilization puts a floor under an issue's price and is more
prevalent with equity issues than bond issues where there is less volatility
in the initial price. Generally the lead manager will over-allot an issue
(if he has 100, he will place 110). If the price goes down, he can buy back
at the lower price in order to fulfil the allocations. If the price goes
up, he is happy with the issue's success but short of paper, so under what
is called the green shoe option, he can call for more paper from the issuer.
<BR>
<BR>
This would, in normal circumstances, be struck down by the FSA: you are
arguably creating a misleading market. But because the authorities see the
wisdom of a steady market, it is sanctioned both by the FSA and by the EC
directive on insider dealing, provided you comply completely with the SIB's
(Securities and Investments Board) rules on stabilization. Some of these
rules are detailed, requiring, for instance, specific warning legends to
be put on the documentation. There is often much debate over the extent
to which, given market knowledge, such legends can be omitted. &quot;These
rules are fairly straightforward when it comes to bonds, more complicated
with equities and harder still with hybrids,&quot; says Peter King, a partner
at Linklaters &amp; Paines and an expert in market regulatory issues. &quot;The
real problem for compliance officers is that their colleagues who do the
issues often don't have time to read them.&quot;

<H4>Charles Darwent kisses the bloody knee of the business community and
makes it feel better </H4>
We have finally decided to offer <I>Backseat</I>'s readership a corporate
shoulder to cry on: the first of our Handy Tips For Haunted Businessfolk
problem page series is printed below. All letters will be answered personally
although, given the obvious high level of demand for this kind of service,
those accompanied by cheques in Swiss francs made payable to &quot;Backseat
Retirement Fund (Cayman Islands) a/c&quot; may find themselves re-ceiving
more attention than others. <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%><BR><BR>Dear Backseat, <BR>
<BR>
Some months ago, my company won a $50 million tender to engineer a piece
of equipment for a new, state-owned fertiliser plant on the outskirts of
a certain Middle Eastern capital. Lately, however, I have begun to wonder
whether the equipment in question - a 100-foot stainless steel tube with
spiral bore markings on the inside - is really intended for use in fertiliser
manufacturing at all. I noticed on a recent site visit that the pipe has
been propped up at a 45&#176; angle and aimed in the direction of the capital
of a neighbouring country with which my clients' government has long enjoyed
warlike relations. For another thing, the executives of the concern - who
have now taken to wearing khaki fatigues - keep pointing to the aforesaid
capital, shouting &quot;boom&quot; and sniggering in what I can only describe
as an ill-natured manner. Do you think I have genuine cause for concern?
<BR>
<BR>
Yours, Furrow-Browed <BR>
<BR>
Dear Furrow-Browed, <BR>
<BR>
Tsk, tsk: aren't we the cultural imperialist, though? In these days of global
marketing, it behoves us all to remember that not everyone does business
in precisely the way we do. Your clients, for example, might well find it
curious that westerners choose to launch supertankers by hitting them with
elderly bottles of fermented grape juice. I am sure you will find that the
wearing of celebratory costume, the uttering of ritual noises and the sound
of laughter all point to the existence of some sort of harmless corporate
ceremony. I am surprised that your clients should have awarded such a lucrative
piece of business to a man who has clearly taken little or no trouble to
study their national mores. You may, indeed, choose to take a humbling lesson
from their obvious generosity of spirit in this respect. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yours, Backseat <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%><BR><BR>
Dear Backseat, <BR>
<BR>
I know this is going to sound kind of weird, but recently life has lost
all meaning for me. Late last year, at the age of 34, I sold the controlling
interest in my Californian software company for $2 billion. Since then I
have spent my time creating an international visual arts foundation that
bears my name, marrying a well-known Hollywood movie starlet and designing
a waterside mansion for my 30,000-acre Washington estate. You would think
I had everything to live for, but somehow I just don't feel fulfilled. What
should I do? <BR>
<BR>
Yours, Troubled <BR>
<BR>
Dear Troubled, <BR>
<BR>
Go and bother somebody else. <BR>
<BR>
Yours, Backseat <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%><BR><BR>
Dear Backseat, <BR>
<BR>
Since our marriage five years ago, my other half's career has really taken
off. It makes me proud, but I can't help resenting the fact that I seem
to have been relegated to the role of corporate accessory in the process:
expected to throw endless company cocktail parties, wearing something skimpy
in the Chanel skirt line and making flirtatious small-talk with perspiring
south east Asian businessmen. I am more than just a 36-D cup with a nice
line in cheese dip, after all. In fact, I find the whole thing deeply patronising.
What do you advise? <BR>
<BR>
Yours, Fed Up <BR>
<BR>
Dear Fed Up, <BR>
<BR>
I hope it comes as some sort of comfort to know that you are not alone in
what you are going through. Many men find it difficult being married to
successful career women, although I do agree that expecting you to wear
short skirts is perhaps taking things a little far on your wife's part.
Everyone knows that above-the-knee is out, out, <I>out</I> this summer.
I should leave a copy of <I>Harper's Bazaar</I> lying around, and hope that
she takes the hint. In the meantime, don't you worry your pretty little
head about it. <BR>
<BR>
Yours, Backseat <BR>
<BR>
PS. Do you really have a good recipe for cheese dip? My husband just cannot
get his to taste right. <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%><BR><BR>
Dear Backseat, <BR>
<BR>
For years now I have been putting in many 14-hour days and seven-day weeks
for my firm. Recently, I realised that so-called friends at work have come
to resent me for it. You know the kind of thing: people fall silent when
I come into the room, whisper about me behind my back, READ MY MAIL. Finally,
yesterday, I told my boss I was onto his game, that I knew he had been beaming
messages through my desktop terminal into my brain. He denied it of course,
suggesting that I was suffering from executive stress and sending me home.
I know it is all part of the plot to discredit me and they're not going
to get away with it. The Lord is not mocked. HA HA HA HA. <BR>
<BR>
Yours, Vengeful <BR>
<BR>
Dear Vengeful, <BR>
<BR>
Goodness, how long it must have taken you to cut all those cute little letters
out of the newspaper and glue them onto the page (I would just love to know
who gave you my private address, by the way, so that I could thank them
personally). Thank you also for the severed ear. I think that perhaps you
could use a nice, long holiday, and I have suggested that a couple of travel
agents call around to talk to you about possible destinations. The special
jacket they have promised to bring with them, with tapes that tie up around
the back, is <I>de rigeur</I> holiday-wear this season, I am told. Unfortunately,
I will have emigrated by the time you come back from your trip, but do rest
assured that I will continue to follow your case with the deepest concern.
<BR>
<BR>
Yours, Backseat <p>

<B>EMERGING MARKETS</H3><B> Edited by Brian Caplen</B>
<H4>TURKEY </H4>
<H2>New empire for Ottoman Bank </H2>
It is still called Bankalar Caddesi, bank street, but shops selling light
fittings have taken over most of the premises that were once occupied by
bank headquarters in Pera, Ottoman Istanbul's European quarter. Driven away
by traffic and pollution, banks moved to custom-made new buildings in the
outer districts of the city where access is easier. <BR>
<BR>
The only bank which still resides on Bankalar Caddesi is the venerable Ottoman
Bank which occupies a colossal nineteenth-century stone building blackened
by smog. But Ottoman too may soon leave. Turkey's oldest bank has been bought
by Ayhan Sahenk, a leading Turkish contractor, who is collecting banks in
the way that other rich men collect antique cars. <BR>
<BR>
Ottoman Bank has been acquired through a leveraged buyout by Garanti Bankasi
- the largest of Sahenk's four banks - for $245 million from Compagnie
Financi&egrave;re Ottomane which is controlled by Banque Paribas. (The other
banks held by Sahenk's holding company Dogus are Korfezbank, Bank Ekspres
and United Guaranty Bank of Amsterdam.) The deal is expected to be completed
in mid-June when cash is exchanged for shares. <BR>
<BR>
The Turkish treasury has already given its blessing, and due diligence,
analysis and appraisal of the bank have been completed without revealing
any irregularities. Not that any were expected. The Ottoman Bank, established
as a Franco-British partnership in 1863 during the reign of Queen Victoria,
has long been regarded as one of the most professional and conservative
of banks in Turkey. <BR>
<BR>
Garanti will pay $45 million dollars from the group's funds and finance
the rest of the purchase through a club loan. The $200 million loan, which
is being led and underwritten by UBS, has been subscribed to by American
Express (Frankfurt), Dresdner Bank, Sanwa, Bankers Trust (London) and Dai-ichi
Kangyo, says Akin Ongor, chief executive officer of Garanti. The loan has
a maturity of three years with an option to extend for a further two years.
The all-in cost is &quot;in the region of&quot; Libor plus 2%, says Ongor.
<BR>
<BR>
The Ottoman Bank was established to bankroll the crumbling Ottoman state
and to put its finances in order. It was the note issuer and it was the
first institution that the sultans turned to when they needed a new loan.
The bank survived two world wars, the break-up of several empires, and the
establishment of nation states in the Middle East and the Balkans. It financed
wars, and provided funding for railways and ports. It bought Egypt's cotton
crop and gave loans for oil operations in the Gulf. It had numerous branches
in many cities including Vienna, Athens, Nicosia, Beirut and Baghdad. <BR>
<BR>
But after the collapse of the Ottomon Empire and the establishment of the
Turkish state in 1923, the Ottoman Bank started to disintegrate as its operations
were nationalized in newly-emerged states, such as Iraq and Iran. In 1931,
the bank lost its status as a bank of issue in Turkey but continued to operate
as a commercial bank. <BR>
<BR>
Why did Sahenk need to buy a new bank when he already has four - particularly
as he owns Garanti, considered by many foreign bankers to be one of the
best in Turkey? <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We want to become larger,&quot; says Ongor. &quot;Garanti decided
to buy the Ottoman Bank to increase its share of the market, which is now
in the region of 5%.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Instead of building one gigantic bank, Sahenk decided to proceed with a
larger number of smaller banks. &quot;The Turkish economy is very volatile,&quot;
says Ongor. &quot;Small banks are flexible whereas larger banks aren't.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Some bankers were sceptical. They cited Citibank and Koc, Turkey's largest
private conglomerate, which refused to pay the money demanded by Paribas
because they considered it to be exorbitant. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I cannot think of a single reason why Garanti needed to do it,&quot;
says one foreign banker. &quot;If you look at it from Sahenk's point of
view, he has got an already perfectly good brand name in Garanti. He has
got a wonderful little boutique bank in Korfez and an interesting franchise
over at Bank Express. Why he had to buy Ottoman, I haven't the slightest
idea.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But Ongor has no doubts that the bank was a bargain. The Ottoman bank, whose
1995 assets were $507 million, has less than 1% of the market, compared
with Garanti's 4%. But according to discounted cash flow analysis, it is
worth between $400 million and $450 million, he says. He believes that with
more dynamic management - the bank's new manager will be Aclan Acar
who now runs Korfez Bank and is described by a foreign banker as &quot;very
ambitious and very smart&quot; - and a new approach, Ottoman Bank would
yield a net return on investment of between 35% and 40% per year. &quot;The
price we paid for the bank is 2.8 times its expected 1996 profits,&quot;
he says. <BR>
<BR>
An American banker describes Ottoman Bank as &quot;an under-utilized franchise
not developed to its full potential by its previous owners. It has a great
name, a fabulous history and a very interesting platform from which to operate
a commercial bank&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The Ottoman Bank occupies a unique position among foreign banks in Turkey.
It is the only foreign-owned multi-branch bank which is active at the retail
level. Contrary to the usual practice in Turkey, the bank was not affiliated
to any commercial or industrial group, nor does it hold any equity participations
in other enterprises. <BR>
<BR>
And unlike the majority of Turkish banks, Ottoman derives its profits from
pure commercial banking rather than speculation in foreign currency and
other instruments, according to Hubert de Saint-Armand, the Ottoman Bank
chairman. Capital adequacy at 20% is uniquely high for Turkey. <BR>
<BR>
In 1995, Ottoman was the fifth biggest tax payer in Istanbul. Despite its
profitability and unique position in the market, the Paribas group did not
make investments for its expansion. The bank's capital was last raised (to
&#163;10 million) in 1873. <BR>
<BR>
A plan to float 15% of the bank's shares was discarded in 1994 when the
political and economic situation worsened. The Paribas group, which has
its own problems, decided to sell. <BR>

<H4>URUGUAY </H4>
<H2>The Switzerland of South America? </H2>
Small, stable Uruguay, which is sandwiched between volatile giants Brazil
and Argentina, has always aspired to be the region's offshore financial
centre - the Switzerland of South America. <BR>
<BR>
That desire has sharpened of late as the country casts around for a role
within the nascent Mercosur customs union which links Uruguay with its two
huge neighbours as well as Paraguay. With that in mind, the government has
embarked on some important reforms, aimed at deepening the local capital
markets, and making the country a more attractive and secure place in which
to park and raise offshore funds. <BR>
<BR>
Changes include the introduction of private pension funds which are expected
eventually to amass savings at a rate of $200 million a month, plus legislation
aimed at easing the issuing of Euronotes by regional companies. Also pending
is legislation on money laundering, which should enhance the country's reputation
for honesty, although bankers fear it might also raise administrative costs.
<BR>
<BR>
Uruguay's offshore foundations are already fairly solid. Twenty years of
liberal banking laws, including full currency convertibility, have secured
the country's reputation as a safe haven for regional flight capital. Witness
last year when, in the wake of Mexico's devaluation, nervous Argentines
boosted Uruguay's offshore deposits by $800 million. Far more than this
passed through the country's banks - most of them controlled by foreign
institutions such as Bank of Boston, Citibank, Chase, Lloyds and Santander
- on its way to other offshore centres. <BR>
<BR>
Total foreign currency deposits in the banking system are $7.4 billion,
of which 43% belong to non-residents. This may be small change in comparison
with more developed offshore centres, but in the context of the country's
$17 billion economy, it is quite substantial. <BR>
<BR>
Uruguay, as well as having no restrictions on currency movements, offers
Latin offshore investors a recent history in which banking laws have remained
stable. In many neighbouring countries, investors are all too used to seeing
their savings devalued overnight, transformed into worthless bonds or simply
seized. Virtually all Uruguay's private banking sector is controlled by
foreign banks, providing depositors with the comforting knowledge that lenders
of last resort are in London, New York or Madrid - not in local central
banks. <BR>
<BR>
There is also &quot;very strong banking secrecy&quot;, says Christopher
Golby, principal manager at Lloyds in Uruguay. &quot;Some lawyers say it
is even stronger than the Swiss banking secrecy laws, and it is energetically
defended by the government and upheld by the legal system.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But Uruguay is far from being the sophisticated offshore financial centre
which it aspires to be. The country is &quot;a very efficient banking sector,
as a place where people put money in time deposits, CDs, current accounts
and so on&quot;, says Douglas Peterson, general director at Citibank in
Uruguay. &quot;But it is a step behind in becoming a financial centre.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Capital markets are barely developed, with local companies too small and
cautious to absorb large amounts of capital. Argentine companies, such as
Telefonica, Pepsi bottler Baesa and energy group Perez Companc, have issued
short-term Euronotes in Uruguay - where spreads are lower than elsewhere
in the region - but these have rarely been for more than $50 million.
Interest from elsewhere, though growing, has been scant. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The problem is there are funds available, but there are not many people
to lend to...You see a lot of excess liquidity that doesn't have a place
to go to,&quot; says Jorge Ramirez, general manager at Banco de Boston.
<BR>
<BR>
Neither is the &quot;degree of liberalization as great as in other financial
centres&quot;, says Golby. For instance, the legal lending limit to any
individual borrower is 25% of a bank's capital. &quot;We would like to be
a booking centre, but we are limited by our local capital base.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The lack of borrowers could be eased by the creation last April of a new
category of institutional investor, the private pension fund administrator
(AFAP). High-earning workers of under 40 are now obliged to place a portion
of their pension contributions in a capitalization account administered
by one of several AFAPs. The scheme, modelled on Chile's pension system,
is initially only expected to amass monthly funds of $70 million, but bankers
say this could double or triple as the system becomes better established.
<BR>
<BR>
As a result of the private pension funds, &quot;there will definitely be
a deepening of the capital markets&quot;, says Peterson. The recent liberalization
of the insurance business has also created a pool of funds looking for attractive
investments, he says. <BR>
<BR>
Other analysts believe Uruguay's pension reform, which leaves much of the
old pay-as-you-go system intact, is too cautious to have any great impact
on capital markets. Besides, in the initial stages, AFAPs will be obliged
to place most of their funds in government-issued bonds, limiting the opportunity
for private-sector placements. <BR>
<BR>
Private issuers should be encouraged, though, by new capital markets legislation
which is expected to be passed in the next few months. This aims to replace
previously hazy legislation with clear rules for regional issuers. Such
regulations should now be compatible with regional centres, especially Brazil,
making it easier for potential issuers to come to Uruguay. Although there
have been two recent issues by Brazilian-based companies - Lloyds Leasing
and Parmalat Brazil - these have been the exception not the rule. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The legislation in the pipeline will facilitate the issue of ONs (Obligaciones
Negociables or corporate paper) by clarifying the rules of the game,&quot;
says Golby. &quot;The previous legislation was very local.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Says Ramirez: &quot;Anything that brings transparency and clear rules to
the market helps. The legislation could be improved, but it's a good start...I
definitely see increased potential for the development of capital markets
here.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Ramirez admits that it will be difficult to attract business from much beyond
the Mercosur region since more distant Latin countries are likely to send
their money to better established international offshore centres such as
the Caymans or Switzerland. <BR>
<BR>
Bankers also worry that Uruguay's advantages as an offshore centre, built
up over 20 years, could be eroded as Argentine and Brazilian banking legislation
catches up. Both countries have conquered rampant inflation and lifted most
capital restrictions, while Argentina has maintained full convertibility
since 1991. <BR>
<BR>
Uruguay &quot;still has competitive advantages,&quot; says Ignacio de Posadas,
former finance minister and now senator, who sponsored proposed changes
to capital markets regulations. It has a tradition of honesty, expertise
and stability unmatched by others in the region, he says. <BR>
<BR>
But the country must ensure that these competitive advantages are maintained
by a constant effort to improve legislation and reduce costs, says de Posadas.
&quot;If Uruguay doesn't watch out, it might be displaced by other countries.&quot;

<H4>THE PHILIPPINES </H4>
<H2>Returning to the Euromarkets </H2>
The Philippines, once Asia's least fashionable market, has suddenly become
its hottest. While the equity market has led the way, with the Manila Composite
Index up by over 40% in the six months to May to 3,200 points, demand for
Philippines paper has been indiscriminate. Asia Equity estimates that $1.5
billion of foreign funds flowed into local debt and equity markets in the
first quarter alone. <BR>
<BR>
Nowhere have the effects been more apparent than in the re-emergence of
Filipino names in the Eurobond market. Ayala Corporation, the country's
oldest and largest real-estate developer, started the ball rolling in early
May with its debut in the Euromarkets. The unrated five-and-a-half-year
issue via JP Morgan met with strong enough demand to be increased in size
from $100 million to $110 million. Priced at 173 basis points (bp) over
the five-year US treasury bond, it achieved the tightest launch spread of
any Philippines issuer, eclipsing the government proxy National Power Corp's
2002 bonds by 10bp. In the two weeks after launch, the spread tightened
quickly to 155bp. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Ayala bond should have been a tougher sell than San Miguel's 2000
bonds [which were launched in 1994 with a then record of 190bp over treasuries]
because of name recognition and the fact that San Miguel has an international
brand name,&quot; says the head of fixed income sales at one US investment
bank in Singapore. &quot;Ayala is purely a play on the domestic economy
and its success underscores the fact that sentiment has turned firmly in
the Philippines' favour.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The excitement is proving contagious. Philippines Long Distance Telephone,
the national telecommunications operator, is said to be looking to refinance
all of its foreign debt as a result. And both Philippine National Bank and
Philippine Commercial &amp; International Bank are rumoured to be on the
brink of issuing Eurobonds at 85bp and 80bp over treasuries respectively.
<BR>
<BR>
While perennial demand for onshore dollars from local banks is partly responsible
for the boom, increased investor confidence in the Philippines' macroeconomic
performance has contributed most. &quot;We are seeing a rerating of the
whole country,&quot; says the chief investment officer of one fixed interest
fund in Hong Kong. &quot;The Ramos government has been as good as its word
in producing a stable currency, low inflation and strong economic growth
and Philippines companies are reaping their just rewards.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Noting that secondary market prices for Philippines' bonds now reflect at
least BBB-rated equivalents around the world, he adds that pressure is now
mounting for a second upgrade in the sovereign rating within 12 months.
Moody's upgraded the foreign currency debt rating of the Philippines from
Ba3 to Ba2 in May 1995. <BR>
<BR>
Investment bankers have been quick to leap on the Philippines bandwagon
in other markets. Turning their attention from the now saturated Thai convertible
market, many have repaired to Manila in an effort to cash in on the good
news. Merrill Lynch was first to the plate with a $125 million offering
for Metro Pacific (MPC), the Philippines' property company affiliate of
Hong Kong's First Pacific, in April. Again buoyed by strong investor demand,
the deal was increased from $115 million through a $10 million greenshoe.
And the 10-year transaction achieved market-beating terms with a coupon
of 2.5%, a conversion premium of 12.5% and a yield-to-put of 125bp over
treasuries. <BR>
<BR>
MPC's success also opened the door for further Filipino issues. Ayala Corporation
followed up with a ground-breaking peso-denominated convertible preference
share issue when BPI Capital led a Ps1 billion issue with a quarterly coupon
of 5% and a 10% premium over the 10-day closing average of the property
conglomerate's common B shares. This was the first to be listed on the local
stock exchange and strong secondary market support saw the conversion price
hit within two weeks of launch. <BR>
<BR>
Real-estate development company Filinvest Development Corporation then picked
up the gauntlet in early May with a $125 million issue led by Goldman Sachs
and achieved slightly better terms than MPC. Its 10-year issue was priced
with a 2.5% coupon, a 13% conversion premium and a yield-to-put after five-and-a-half
years of 100bp over treasuries. <BR>
<BR>
The pipeline has since grown to over $500 million with issues expected from
food manufacturer RFM Corp ($75 million via Salomon Brothers) and cellular
phone company Piltel (around $200 million) expected to be next on the block.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The entire convertible market in 1995 raised only $300 million,&quot;
says Danilo Feliciano, director of corporate finance at securities house
Exchange Capital in Manila. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This has already been eclipsed and there could easily be another half
a billion dollars worth of issues in the next few months.&quot; <BR>

<H4>MOROCCO </H4>
<H2>New gateway to north Africa </H2>
Given that Morocco has not borrowed in the international capital markets
for over 15 years, the $60 million global depositary receipts (GDR) issued
by Banque Marocaine du Commerce Ext&eacute;rior (BMCE) in April offered
many foreign investors their first opportunity to invest in the country.
Over 70% of those who bought the offering were first-time investors in Morocco.
<BR>
<BR>
The BMCE issue, lead-managed by Nomura and the IFC, was the first north
African GDR and the largest by a Middle Eastern issuer. More than four times
oversubcribed and priced at $12.70 at the top end of the range, the GDRs
were trading at around $15 in mid-May, a slight premium over the price of
BMCE shares on the Casablanca Stock Exchange (CSE). <BR>
<BR>
Another positive sign was that only 5% of the issue changed hands within
the first week. Owing to secondary market demand, which exceeded the original
issue size of $52 million, a greenshoe option involving some $8 million
of additional stock was exercised. <BR>
<BR>
The GDRs are listed in London with Nomura, Robert Fleming and Citibank acting
as market-makers. <BR>
<BR>
According to Assaad Razzouk, head of Middle East investment banking at Nomura
in London, demand totalled $211 million. Almost all blue-chip emerging market
funds were involved in the deal. &quot;When you consider that the best estimate
for total foreign portfolio investment in the CSE is $150 million, it says
a lot about the difference in demand for Moroccan instruments when you tailor
them to the international market.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
BMCE, Morocco's foreign trade bank, is the second largest bank in the country.
It underwent a high-profile and successful privatization last year, and
has since decentralized decision-making, focused on core activities -
it is committed to selling 50% of its equity portfolio within the next 15
months - and placed greater emphasis on profitability than market share.
The GDR was partly a way of introducing the bank's new management, under
the chairmanship of Othman Benjelloun, to the international investor community.
<BR>
<BR>
Says Brahim Benjelloun Touimi, a director of BMCE: &quot;The chairman wanted
to irreversibly enlarge the bank's international equity ownership. The aim
was not so much to raise capital - we could have easily done that by
tapping the domestic market. But we wanted to be first onto the international
market.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Says Othman Benjelloun: &quot;My real desire was to confirm that Morocco
today is an emerging market. It has been on the way to becoming such for
the past two or three years. I wanted to prove to ourselves and our foreign
friends that we are on an upward curve. In our presentations to investors
we of course gave details about BMCE's new management since it was privatized
and its profitability. But the success of this issue also reflects the success
of the structural reforms in Morocco.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Mansour Kelada-Antoun, the IFC's regional representative for north Africa,
says the issue had a big impact on Morocco and on BMCE. &quot;Up to now,
institutional investors haven't been able to get a good feel for Morocco's
investment environment and creditworthiness. Although this is an equity
issue, by presenting a macroeconomic picture of the country, it puts Morocco
back on the international investment map.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Adds Nomura's Razzouk: &quot;This was the first time that Morocco has been
marketed in a systematic way to foreign portfolio investors. Our analysts
were out there for three months beforehand. Now the market has a lot more
knowledge and it has paved the way for other issues from Morocco. I think
we'll see another one before the end of the year.&quot; <BR>

<H3>FRONT END</H3> 
 <B>Edited by Steven Irvine</B>

<H2>Brawn triumphs over class </H2>
Anatoly Chubais left the Russian government on January 16 the same way he
served it for over four years, with quiet class. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I hope this has to do only with one individual, not a whole economic
policy,&quot; the reformer remarked, tendering a resignation already ordered
by president Boris Yeltsin. <BR>
<BR>
The future of sound economic policy is far from clear, however. As head
of the State Property Committee and later first vice-premier, Chubais quietly
endured the slanders of every major post-Soviet blowhard from Ruslan Khasbulatov
to Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Now Boris Yeltsin has added his name to the list.
<BR>
<BR>
Yeltsin's chief economic adviser Alexander Livshitz, a man of whom one generally
expects better, kicked off the scapegoat campaign. First he patted history's
greatest (by volume) privatizer condescendingly on the head as a &quot;young
man who will undoubtedly still do more for his country&quot;. Then he blamed
him, among other things, for state workers being paid months late. <BR>
<BR>
Yeltsin personally expanded the indictment to absurd proportions a few days
later, announcing that but for the odious Chubais, the semi-official Our
Home is Russia political bloc would have doubled its score in the December
parliamentary elections, from 10% to 20%. Chubais was completely uninvolved
in the Our Home campaign, which relied almost exclusively on the personality
of prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. <BR>
<BR>
Yet Chubais proved durable precisely because he lacked vanity. Unlike his
more theatrical colleagues Yegor Gaidar and Boris Fyodorov he understood
that politics is the art of working with people you do not always agree
with. When the press cornered him for a reaction to Yeltsin's charge, he
murmured merely that the president &quot;may have exaggerated&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
A professor of economics by the age of 23, Chubais started his political
career by organizing half a dozen colleagues to grow vegetables and using
the profits to contest St Petersburg's first city council elections in 1990.
The group included most of Russia's soon-to-be privatization technocrats:
Pyotr Fillipov who wrote the Privatization Law; Dmitri Vasiliev who now
heads the Securities Commission; and Pyotr Mostovoi who runs the Bankruptcy
Authority. <BR>
<BR>
Chubais is the highest-ranking victim of Yeltsin's apparent campaign to
sack all the decent people in his government. <BR>
<BR>
Yet Chubais' work as a privatizer is done and cannot be undone. While his
voucher scheme turned few Russian enterprises into anything remotely resembling
investor-owned businesses, it did wreck beyond repair the centralized command
system and put each factory's fate in the hands of its managers and workers.

<H3>SCHRODERS TOUTS AFTER RECORDS </H3>
The allure of winning lucrative and prestigious mandates for big Japanese
privatization sales - NTT, Japan Tobacco, JR East - has investment banks
once again boasting about their superior qualifications. <BR>
<BR>
The most original tactic comes from Schroders, one of the last British-owned
investment banks, whose secret weapon is 60 centimetres long, made of iron
but worth its weight in platinum. It is a piece of track from the first
Japanese railway line, financed by the Imperial Government of Japan's first-ever
foreign bond issue in 1870, placed successfully in London by Schroders.
The holy relic is kept in the office of Hitoshi Tanaka, who stepped down
last year as chairman of Schroder Securities in Japan and is now senior
adviser. <BR>
<BR>
The first railway line was a landmark in Japan's modernization but ran only
a short distance from Tokyo's Shimbashi to the port city of Yokohama. It
was opened by the Meiji emperor in December 1872, as recorded at the time
in Japanese <I>ukiyo-e</I> wood-block prints. (The steam locomotive for
the line was built in Lancashire, England and today occupies pride of place
in the Transport Museum in Tokyo.) <BR>
<BR>
&quot;For your typically sleepy Japanese fund manager it grabs attention.
It's definitely a unique way to start a conversation - rather than talking
about the latest coupons on warrant bonds,&quot; says Steven Thomas of Schroder
Securities (Japan). <BR>
<BR>
There is a rumour that Kleinwort Benson was part of the 1870 consortium,
although Shimpei Kasama of KB in Tokyo is understandably keener to talk
about his firm's role as global coordinator (with Dresdner Bank) for the
privatization of Deutsche Telekom. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I heard that Barings was asked for support in building the railway,
but when executives in London opened an atlas they concluded that the land
between Tokyo and Yokohama was a swamp, so they refused,&quot; says Mitsuhide
Fukumoto, head of capital markets for ING Baring Securities in Tokyo. His
head office in London, however, claims this error of judgement was remedied
by Barings' placing of &quot;the first Japanese government securities in
the USA&quot; during the 1903 to 1905 Russo-Japanese war, and financing
&quot;in the early 20th century&quot; railways in the south and west of
Japan. Fukumoto prefers not to dwell on such distant glories: &quot;Please
write that Barings' big claim is now the support of ING, that in terms of
assets we are the biggest finance house in the world.&quot; <BR>

<H3>LAST ORDERS, PLEASE... </H3>
Germany's most famous wine bar may have served its last drink. It has taken
a battering since the privatization agency sold management of it in 1990.
Auerbach's Keller in Leipzig, which figures in Goethe's <I>Faust</I>, stayed
in private hands right through the communist era although it was operated
by a state catering company. In 1992 Frankfurt property king J&uuml;rgen
Schneider bought the operating rights and a share in the property, but the
pub became embroiled in Schneider's bankruptcy in 1994. <BR>
<BR>
Commerzbank has taken over Schneider's interest in the site. But last September
the Keller closed for a Dm3 million refit and may not reopen because of
a dispute between the liquidators and unions. Its permanent loss would be
almost as tragic as the fate of Goethe's eponymous hero, who sold his soul
to the devil. The real Dr Faustus is said to have drunk there with his students
in the 1520s. In Goethe's play, Mephistopheles amazes Faust and some students
by causing excellent wines to gush from a wooden table in the bar. <BR>
<BR>
The city of Leipzig has been involved in negotiations to keep the historic
pub going. Economic chief Christian Albert Jacke predicts an agreement soon.

<H3>PRIVATIZATION GIVES MONGOLIANS THE HUMP</H3>
Privatization in Mongolia may have its enthusiasts from president Punsalmaagiin
Ochirbat downwards, but the post-communist government would not be wise
to rely on the votes of camel-lovers in the next general election. <BR>
<BR>
The privatization programme has had unwelcome consequences for camels from
the nomadic country. The daily newspaper in Ulan Bator, <I>Ardiin Erkh</I>,
has suggested that up to a third of them have been killed in the dash for
ready money since the collapse of communism. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;As the collectives have been privatized in the 1990s, the animals
were distributed indiscriminately to those who knew nothing about livestock,
as well a<BR>
<BR>
s skilled herders,&quot; a food and agriculture ministry official, Mr Donzoi,
was quoted as saying. Mongolians have slaughtered about 225,000 Bactrian
(two-humped) camels since 1990, selling the meat and fat or using it for
food, he said. <BR>
<BR>
Even with natural growth of the herd, the number of Mongolia's camels had
fallen to 366,100 by the end of 1994 from 537,500 in 1990, a loss of about
one-third, he added. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Some of the people who received camels in the privatization process
thought of them as meat,&quot; he said. &quot;Thus the camels, which have
abundant meat and fat, came to be seen as the most profitable means of getting
money.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The official said the economically difficult years of 1991 and 1992 were
particularly hard on the herd, with 177,000 camels being slaughtered. An
average of only 24,000 a year were killed in 1993 and 1994, he added. Donzoi
said the camel decline may now have been halted. <BR>
<BR>
Camels also fared poorly during Mongolia's three decades of Soviet-style
collectivization, which began in 1954, falling in number from what had been
a historical peak of 893,000. &quot;Loss of camels in large numbers began
a year after collectivization,&quot; Donzoi said. &quot;This proves how
bad the consequences are when owners and their property are separated.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Rural herders can be excused today for not grasping the Mongolian government's
wider privatization aims. President Ochirbat last year reviled the administration
for failing to sustain the private sector and communicating the good news
about privatization. <BR>
<BR>
Although only 19.2% of the economy is in private hands, state inaction has
led Mongolians to believe the private sector is far bigger. &quot;Because
of faulty propaganda about privatization, the public understands that the
state no longer owns anything,&quot; the president said. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Henry Gibbon</B> 
<BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>
<H3>THEY LIVE TO ROADSHOW </H3>
Behind an unassuming red-brick facade lurks one of London's most extraordinary
offices, and quite possibly the most successful force in world privatization:
Imagination. <BR>
<BR>
Founded in 1978 by Gary Withers (still managing director), Imagination began
by launching new products for Ford. But when IPO roadshows began with the
large UK privatizations in the late 1980s, it quickly seized the initiative,
organizing roadshows for British Gas, British Steel and the UK electricity
companies. <BR>
<BR>
To begin with, these were full of the razzmatazz of the confident, high-spending
times. Paul Mackay - an exuberant pony-tailed Australian who was production
manager of <I>The</I> <I>Rocky Horror Show</I> before joining Imagination
in 1985 - wowed investors with his illuminated columns of bubbling water
and tubes of crackling neon. <BR>
<BR>
As recession bit in the 1990s, the extravagant displays were toned down
and Mackay's ponytail came off, but the company kept its grip on the roadshow
market. Last year it handled nearly all the major privatization roadshows
- including National Power, Repsol, Telefonica, PTT and ENI. These contributed
nearly a third of its &#163;44 million turnover. <BR>
<BR>
Because Imagination got such a head start, competitors have found it hard
to win mandates. <BR>
<BR>
Drawing on a multi-skilled workforce of 200, Imagination sees to everything
from the scripting and stage settings to the catering, travel and accommodation.
&quot;They're like an executive Mothercare,&quot; says one banker, referring
to a well-known chain that sells baby-care products. &quot;Roadshows can
be a ghastly business, and Imagination is extremely good at creating a hassle-free
environment.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Mackay's number two, Simon Bruxner-Randall, previously worked with him as
a lighting designer. &quot;With roadshows, as in theatre,&quot; he says,
&quot;the show must go on.&quot; For one major global offering, Imagination's
attention to logistical detail involved having two planes on standby at
a private airfield in case Chicago airport became snowbound. &quot;One thing
we won't do,&quot; says Bruxner-Randall, &quot;is reduce costs to the extent
that we're taking any risks.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, the huge cost of roadshows (anywhere between &#163;250,000
and &#163;1 million) can be a sensitive political issue, and is the main
reason why Imagination's only serious competitor, HP:ICM, recently won the
mandate to do the UK's Railtrack roadshow. &quot;We all know how to do roadshows
now,&quot; says HP:ICM's managing director Lois Jacobs. &quot;And clients
have a better understanding of how much things cost.&quot; <BR>

<H3>NatWest buys Greenwich to boost fixed-income unit </H3>

NATWEST has taken a major step forward in its efforts to develop its global
fixed-income business with the acquisition of Greenwich Capital in the US.
<BR>
<BR>
Connecticut-based Greenwich has been sold by the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan, for approximately $590m, with NatWest apparently beating off competing
bids from other interested parties. <BR>
<BR>
On completion of the takeover, the global fixed-income business of NatWest
Markets, the group's corporate and investment banking division, will be
named Greenwich NatWest with the Greenwich Capital name being retained in
US markets. <BR>
<BR>
Gary Holloway and Konrad Kruger, co-presidents and co-chief executives of
Greenwich, will become co-heads of global fixed-income for NatWest Markets,
reporting to Peter Hall, deputy chief executive of NatWest Markets responsible
for North American operations. They will also join the NatWest Markets executive
committee in London and its US management committee. <BR>

Greenwich's main operating company, Greenwich Capital Markets Inc, is a
leading US fixed-income securities broker-dealer in US Treasuries, mortgage,
asset-backed securities and G-7 sovereign debt. <BR>
<BR>
It became a primary dealer in 1984 and is ranked in the top 10. As at December
31, 1995, its total capital, including subordinated debt, was approximately
$465m with net assets of approximately $243m, and its 1995 pre-tax profits
were $75m, with its average total assets at approximately $32bn. <BR>
<BR>
Said Martin Owen, chief executive of NatWest Markets: &quot;This acquisition
completes the major strategic moves NatWest Markets needed to build a strong
competitive position in the US. We now have critical mass in the US government
bond markets, providing strong institutional distribution and trading expertise.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Following the recent acquisition of Gleacher &amp; Co, Owen said NatWest's
latest acquisition made it one of the strongest overseas banks in the US.
The addition of Greenwich's consistently profitable business would provide
a strong platform for NatWest to develop its position in the global bond
markets, he added. * <BR>

<H3>THE MOORGATE SAGA </H3>
<H2>Copper bottomed code </H2>
<B>The Bankers' Club, 7 Lothbury, London EC2</B> <BR>
<BR>
I am propped up peacefully against a corner of the bar here, doing some
field work as chair of the club's special sub-committee on martini mixes,
but what happens next, these guys shanghai me, Herbie, they say, just the
man we need, how much do you know about copper, as much as us, well, then,
you can write us all a code of conduct. <BR>
<BR>
What I know about copper is that this Mr Five Per Cent from Sumitomo turns
out to be long of the world's stock of it and has options on Mars and goes
down for $4 billion, well, so what if he does, Sumitomo can afford it, and
copper is one fine mess even Holey Buckett never gets us into, tho' he tries.
<BR>
<BR>
Holey knows someone who makes &#163;156 a year from trading it, the guy
is out to lunch half the time and now retires to Monte Carlo, so it must
be money for old rope, says Holey, and why do we not take the business on,
I tell him to lie down until the feeling goes away, and now it turns out
this guy fronts for Sumitomo, which explains why he has copper on his fingers.
<BR>
<BR>
I start to explain this to the posse in the club, but they take no persuasion,
they just say this Five Per Cent San is one rogue trader too many, and if
we are not careful some regulator comes along and makes trading illegal,
and where do we all go for honey after that, so we figure the Bankers' Club
must take the lead, and issue guidelines, it is something for that committee
of yours to do, when it is not writing to Gordon's to ask for free samples,
get on with it, Herbie. <BR>
<BR>
Mom, I can see there is nothing for it, and at least we write the rules
to suit ourselves, we make steady progress in our drafting sessions, here
is where we are so far: <BR>
<BR>
<B>Drawers</B> Sumitomo's guy has all his mail sent to his locker, and Barings
gives Leeson a desk with a drawer in it, and a lock on the drawer, which
makes it a good place for him to keep scissors and paste and letters with
the signature cut out of them, and makes him a classic case of the TIDs
Syndrome, standing for Tickets in Drawer, we recommend no drawers in desks
in dealing rooms, and no locks on the lockers either. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Going and looking</B> A star trader does not wish to have anyone looking
over his shoulder, and for a rogue trader this goes double, so the managers
stay far away, can draw their bonuses when all goes well, and when it all
goes wrong they know nothing about it, just like Peter Baring and his head
honcho, Andrew Turkey, but we do not recommend this. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Back office</B> Yes, have one of these, and do not leave the star trader
in charge of it, we are all of us brought up to believe that this is Rule
One, it surprises us to find how many highly paid managements never get
beyond Rule Zero. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Back office bonuses</B> We recommend bonuses for clerks who figure there
is something wrong, paid by way of commission on the money they save, say,
a straight 5 per cent, even if they are little jerks from the back office
who none of the top brass ever hear of, until it is too late. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Memories are made of this</B> The committee adopts my Law of the Banking
Cycle, which lays down how banks repeat their worst mistakes when the guy
who can remember what happens last time retires, we figure the cycle is
speeding up, and put this down to early retirements, on account of downsizing
and flatter structures and all that, these policies have their costs and
take their toll, so maybe we can all look forward to second careers as remembrancers.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Supervision by lunching around</B> What we have now is supervision by
box checking, which means every time something goes wrong the supervisors
send us more boxes to check, we figure this for a process that reaches its
limits, instead we recommend the appointment of non-executive supervisors,
whose function it is to work round the lunch rooms and pick up the scuttlebutt,
markets are sounding boards, someone has to listen to them, and some of
us look forward to a second career in this, too. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Alchemy</B> Every so often some smart guy will show up in a dealing room
and undertake to turn lead into gold, but even if his name is not Joe Jett,
if you cannot figure out what he is doing, tell him not to do it. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Down the line</B> Like it says in Up The Organization, the difficulty
of managing anything varies with the square of the distance, unless you
cross water, in which case treble it, no wonder Sumitomo's guy loves doing
business in London. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Matrix management</B> This solution can be ordered off the peg from firms
of consultants who charge bespoke fees, and is a proven way to make things
worse and cross every wire and leave guys in the head office with distant
profit center on their budget, until these turn out to be loss centers.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Peer group regulation</B> The committee figures this works in the market
the way it works on the race track, that is, no peer ever gets warned off,
on account the stewards are at school with him, but his trainer's assistant
and his schooling jockey take the high jump, this happens at Barings, Leeson
is on the Changi fish head diet and the guys on his reporting line get three
years walking exercise, all the way up to this Turkey, who passes the peer
group test and is threatened with a well paid job at Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Anti-social behaviour</B> We have trouble in defining this, long liquid
lunches, no, sniffing prohibited substances, yes, mooning in Singapore girlie
bars, maybe, some of us regard this as the sure sign of a dealer who is
going off the rails, and some of us say single men in dealing rooms do not
grow into plaster saints. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Old stagers</B> The committee is split on this, too, some of us say it
is rash to leave the same guy in the same posting for a long time, like
that Daiwa guy or Mr Five Per Cent, it is no excuse for him to say he is
dug in nicely where he is and does not plan to go home, but, Mom, I do not
wish to see this appear among our guidelines, as I figure it may be misconstrued,
much love from <BR>
<BR>
Your durable son <BR>
<BR>
<B>Herbie's committee has co-opted Christopher Fildes </B><p>

<H3>FINANCIAL LAWYER </H3>
<H2>A large step for global exempt offerings</H2>
<H4>
A change in US accounting standards has simplified the behind-the-scenes
negotiations in global exempt offerings. By Christopher Stoakes </H4>
Last month a small thicket in the vast forest of US capital markets regulation
was cut back. This should lighten the hearts of issuers, which are regularly
frustrated by the battles which break out between their underwriters, the
auditors and the lawyers. <BR>
<BR>
The change concerns a Statement of Auditing Standards (SAS) issued by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). It affects all
offerings which have a US tranche, even if made by non-US issuers. When
an offering is made even in part in the US, the issuer's auditors are asked
by the underwriters to provide them with what is known as a comfort letter.
<BR>
<BR>
Essentially, this letter confirms (1) that the financial statements included
in the prospectus, and the auditors' opinion on those financial statements,
are the ones the auditors actually audited (ie, tying the financial statements
in the prospectus to the last set of audited accounts); (2) that certain
procedures have been performed in respect of the other financial and statistical
data in the prospectus (this usually says that the auditors have traced
the figures back to accounting records or the financial statements) and;
(3) that nothing has come to the auditors' attention which gives them reason
to believe the issuer's financial state has materially adversely changed
since the last audited accounts. <BR>
<BR>
This last is called a negative assurance. Typically in an offering which
includes a US tranche, the prospectus will contain three years of audited
income statements and two years of audited balance sheets. That information,
running through to the end of the last audit year, has, in market jargon,
been &quot;expertised&quot; by the auditors. But there is a stub period,
which runs from the end of the last audited year to the date of the sale
of the securities, for which there are no audited financial statements in
the prospectus. It is to this stub period that the negative assurance relates.
The reason why underwriters want this assurance is because, in the litigious
US, they need to be able to establish a defence of due diligence if the
offering goes wrong and the investors sue. The negative assurance is a part
(but not all) of that defence. <BR>
<BR>
The plot thickens in the case of certain exempt offerings, such as private
placements under section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and private
placements to &quot;qualified institutional buyers&quot; under Rule 144A.
In these cases, the AICPA allows auditors to give a negative assurance only
if they in turn obtain from the underwriters a representation that, in effect,
the due-diligence process has been carried out as stringently as it would
have been for a registered offering, ie, one to retail investors, where
the standards of due diligence are demanding. This is enshrined in SAS 72.
Indeed, the precise words of SAS 72 are that the due-diligence process must
be &quot;substantially consistent with the due-diligence process&quot; in
a registered offering. This has led to much thoughtful scratching of legal
heads over the years as to the meaning of &quot;substantially consistent&quot;.
The representation expected of the underwriters is called an SAS 72 Representation
Letter. <BR>
<BR>
On the face of it, then, the underwriters and auditors simply exchange letters.
Why? The answer is risk. The auditors argue that they should not be on the
hook if the due-diligence duty falls, as it should do, on the underwriters.
After all, due diligence is their job. The underwriters get paid by commission
whereas the auditors charge by time spent, not value. Why should they take
risk without the reward? <BR>
<BR>
This makes for further legal wrangling along the lines of the meaning of
&quot;substantially consistent&quot; - fascinating for the lawyers, important
to the underwriters and auditors but not something which the average issuer,
especially one from outside the US, necessarily feels is worth the candle.
The problem is that non-US issuers are likely to find that any auditing
firm sufficiently large to be acceptable to the market is either a US firm
or an international firm with a US arm and subject, therefore, to the various
SAS requirements. <BR>
<BR>
But it gets worse. If the underwriters refuse to provide an SAS 72 Representation
Letter, SAS 72 says that the auditors cannot provide the negative assurance.
Stalemate. To overcome this, auditors have, as directed by SAS 72, taken
to handing over something called an Agreed-Upon Procedures Letter. The form
of this letter is laid down by SAS 35 which allows auditors, after performing
certain procedures (including discussions with officers of the issuer who
are responsible for financial and accounting matters), to give a negative
assurance as to whether certain unaudited financial statements of the issuer
have been prepared in line with Gaap (generally accepted accounting standards).
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In a typical securities offering, SAS 35 is not actually responsive
to the entire situation, since underwriters need comfort on the stub period,&quot;
explains Alan Bannister, a New York attorney with UK law firm Clifford Chance,
who advises on US and international securities transactions. &quot;SAS 35
did, however, provide the framework for a form of negative assurance which,
although not prescribed by SAS 35, had become a widely accepted compromise.&quot;
The auditors would state that the issuer's officers had confirmed that,
during the stub period, there had been no material adverse change in the
issuer's capital structure or long-term debt or (as compared with the same
period in the previous year) net income. Although this became market practice,
the actual text of the negative assurance would have to be hammered out
afresh for each issue in often extensive negotiations between the underwriters,
the auditors and the underwriters' US lawyers, since the text itself was
not laid down by SAS 35. <BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, the AICPA has come to the rescue. At the end of April, SAS
76 took effect. &quot;SAS 76 has embraced what had become widespread market
practice,&quot; Bannister notes. It gives a green light to the previous
practice adopted in reliance on SAS 35 while confirming that auditors cannot
give a negative assurance in the absence of an SAS 72 Representation Letter
from the underwriters. This may seem a small step for mankind, but it is
a large one for global exempt offerings. <BR>

<H4>NEW-BORROWER PROFILE </H4>
<H2>A strange beast from Berlin </H2>
Only two things stand out when you enter Berlin's once-charming Alexanderplatz,
made horrific by the Communists and now being rebuilt: the first is an imposing
golf-tee-shaped television transmitter, ever the symbol of Big Brother,
the second is the slightly less imposing logo of Bankgesellschaft Berlin
(BGB), whose large entwined lines of red, blue and yellow plastic rotate
on the rooftop of one of the two buildings it has bought in the square.
<BR>
<BR>
Literally meaning &quot;banking company of Berlin&quot;, the newest entrant
to the Euromarkets is Germany's sixth-largest banking group. It was consolidated
in 1994 in a structure that even those who work for it call a &quot;strange
beast&quot;. Yet it can lay claim to being a universal bank. &quot;The only
thing that differentiates us from Deutsche Bank is that we have a unique
shareholder structure,&quot; says a Bankgesellschaft Berlin staff member.
<BR>
<BR>
It certainly does, and that is what makes it an intriguing prospect for
the Euromarkets, especially since it has just set up a Euro medium-term
note (EMTN) programme that indicates it will borrow $5 billion, beginning
with a Deutschmark benchmark in June at the earliest. It started a roadshow
on the last day of May to explain to Asian investors just this very thing.
<BR>
<BR>
Some history first. Post-unification, the state of Berlin decided to unify
its banking interests. A &quot;legal conundrum&quot; followed: how to bring
under a single private-sector holding company one public and two private
banks, all of which were wholly or partly owned by the state of Berlin.
This was solved in 1994 when Landesbank Berlin (a Landesbank and savings
bank), Berliner Bank (a commercial bank) and Berlin Hyp (a mortgage bank)
were incorporated into Bankgesellschaft Berlin. To add to the confusion,
BGB is not only the holding company, it is also the investment bank. The
state of Berlin controls 56.8% of the holding company. <BR>
<BR>
A debate followed as to how the new institution would borrow in the international
capital markets. Would it take advantage of the Landesbank's superior credit
rating - it is rated AA1 by Moody's, while the group is AA3 -
or would it resist this temptation and seek to establish its profile under
its new name, the lesser-rated BGB? <BR>
<BR>
It prevaricated and initially limited its borrowing to private placements,
mainly in Japan, where it borrowed as the Landesbank and on-lent to the
rest of the group. It issued its first yen private placement in February
1995 and borrowed about Dm4 billion ($2.6 billion) over the course of the
year. But Hans Leukers, the member of the managing board who was driving
the move into international borrowing and who arrived from the innovative
WestLB, knew this was not satisfactory. So in the meantime work began on
creating BGB Finance, a special-purpose vehicle based in Dublin. <BR>
<BR>
Heinz-Dieter Gottschalk - another arrival from WestLB in 1993, where
he was global head of swaps - managed the process in the early stages
and then brought in a lawyer, Martin M&uuml;ller, from Deutsche Handelsbank,
to be head of international funding. <BR>
<BR>
They have created a synthetic vehicle which appears to attain the best of
both worlds. BGB Finance's name alludes to Bankgesellschaft Berlin but the
credit rating is probably going to be AA1 because of the implicit guarantee
of the Landesbank Berlin. The state of Berlin must keep a majority shareholding
until 2023 - although there is a rumour that it will soon sell down
its equity to 50.1%, keeping a golden share. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Look at my business cards,&quot; says an enthusiastic spokesperson.
&quot;It says we're Bankgesellschaft Berlin, so why should we borrow as
the Landesbank?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
At the time of going to press, Moody's was being typically coy about how
it would rate the BGB vehicle. But bankers universally suspect it will respect
the implicit Landesbank guarantee. A Landesbank is a solid institution which,
thanks to the <I>Anstalt und Gew&auml;hrtr&auml;ger</I> and the <I>L&auml;nderfinanzausgleich</I>,
is guaranteed by the federal government of Germany itself. <BR>
<BR>
What is particularly neat about the strategy, according to bankers, is that
this debut borrower will be able to distinguish itself from the numerous
Landesbanks already issuing, which some investors are either bored with
or overweight in. A spokesperson even alludes to it being a more interesting
credit play: &quot;It carries all the features of Landesbank risk, but it
has three guarantors [Berliner Bank, Berlin Hyp <I>and</I> Berliner Landesbank]
which is interesting for bondholders.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
All this will be explained on the Asian roadshow, which will go to Tokyo,
Hong Kong, Beijing and Singapore. If it's at all confusing, it's likely
to be most so in Tokyo, since that is where the Landesbank Berlin has issued.
M&uuml;ller has already been there once on a pre-emptive marketing strike
that may have clarified the situation. A spokesperson says the credit story
that will be sold is that &quot;we're a big bank [Dm282 billion balance
sheet] with a unique structure, in the fastest-growing area of Europe, in
the capital city of Germany, with a strong capital base, and a strong shareholder
behind us.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Its first issue, mandated to JP Morgan and CS First Boston, will be in Deutschmarks
and could occur as early as June, depending on market conditions. It will
be a benchmark of anything up to Dm1.5 billion, and although the borrower
hopes to issue at the long end of the curve, it realizes the tightest pricing
is still available at five years, where peculiar arbitrage exists because
of the thinness of the futures contract in five-year government bonds. <BR>
<BR>
A second issue in dollars, expected in the autumn, is mandated to Morgan
Stanley and UBS, and could be anything up to $750 million. However it is
expected that the bulk of the bank's borrowing - at least $5 billion
for the remainder of 1996 and 1997 - will be in Deutschmarks. This
is because the borrowing programme is driven by the needs of the asset-swap
portfolio of Dm26 billion, of which 60% is denominated in Deutschmarks.
<BR>
<BR>
Bankgesellschaft Berlin is reluctant to benchmark itself - &quot;we
will benchmark ourselves against equivalent risks,&quot; says a spokesperson,
unwilling to utter the word &quot;Landesbank&quot;. But, he says, the first
issue is so strategically important that &quot;the emphasis will be on fair
pricing. The first issue has to be remembered as well priced.&quot; So tightening
can be expected. <BR>
<BR>
The choice of lead-managers - no Germans - reflects the issuer's
desire to achieve international placement. Equally the nine-strong EMTN
dealer group has no Germans. <BR>
<BR>
And if its international borrowing programme develops anything near as rapidly
as Berlin's biggest building site, the Potsdamer Platz, the Euromarkets
can look forward to an issuer as large as it is innovative. Watch this space,
for example, for BGB's global Pfandbrief that isn't a Pfandbrief. <BR>

<H4>EUROPEAN SWAPS </H4>
<H2>Adventures on the curves </H2>
European swap traders have had more sleepless nights than usual over the
past few months. The favoured trade since the turn of the year has hinged
on expectations that French bond yields - now, unusually, below German
rates - will rise above Germany's in the first half of the year. But
uncertainties over European monetary union (Emu), the determination of the
French government to push through austerity measures and an historically
steep German yield curve have confounded dealers. <BR>
<BR>
The trade is a forward-starting swap betting that the anomaly in the relationship
between long-term German and French interest rates will reverse. The trader
fixes rates on a three-year French franc swap three years forward and receives
the equivalent Deutschmark swap. By doing so the trader is fixing French
rates today and agreeing to pay them for three years beginning in three
years. The trade moves into profit if the German yield curve flattens and
the French curve steepens - or when German rates fall in the long end
and French rates rise. <BR>
<BR>
German 10-year swap rates, representing expectations of how interest rates
will move over 10 years, are trading above French rates. Most economists
argue that because Germany's economy remains fundamentally stronger than
France's, German rates should be below French rates, especially in the long
end of the market where expectations about inflation count the most. <BR>
<BR>
The three-year forward franc swap has been between 30 basis points and 40bp
under three-year German forward rates for the past two months. But the current
three-year French rate is 36bp above Germany's and most pundits expect it
to continue to trade at a premium. &quot;At the beginning of the year everyone
bet on the convergence of the spread,&quot; says a swap trader at CSFB.
&quot;These bets have now been marked to market at minus 30bp to minus 40bp.&quot;
The trades were placed at flat to minus 10bp. &quot;We're concerned rather
than panicked,&quot; says the trader. &quot;The nightmare scenario is for
French bonds to continue to outperform German ones.&quot; Anomalous forward
swap rates are not unprecedented. &quot;If you look at the forward curve
three years ago it was at minus 80bp,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
Few traders intended to hold their forward swap positions beyond the end
of the year, but many will be forced to retain trades, in the hope that
the German yield curve will flatten and the French curve steepen, or bail
out now and realize their losses. &quot;A lot of money has been put into
deconverging trades,&quot; says a swap trader at SBC Warburg. &quot;There
is no doubt that some houses are either accruing losses or are sitting on
losses if they have a mark-to-market system.&quot; Reports that one US investment
bank booked a $100 million loss when it marked its positions to market are
plausible but probably exaggerated. &quot;These losses are conceivable but
unlikely,&quot; says the trader. &quot;Because the spread has moved 100bp
over the past year, it means that the bank must have been losing $1 million
per basis point. That implies an initial position of $10 billion.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Even the traders themselves cannot pinpoint which bank may be suffering
the most. &quot;So many trades have been swapped and reswapped that it's
difficult to know who is left holding the position,&quot; says the trader
at CSFB. <BR>
<BR>
So why are forward swap rates so stubbornly at odds with prevailing rates?
The steepening of the German yield curve owes much to anxieties about Emu,
in which Germany is expected to be a net loser while France is likely to
gain. The two-year to 10-year German yield spread is 272bp, the French spread
is only 206bp. Growing realization that France and Germany will be among
the first members of Emu, despite failure to fulfil the Maastricht Treaty's
convergence criteria, may be the underlying reason for the rerating of their
debt. <BR>
<BR>
The two rates began to converge last October, after French president Jacques
Chirac committed himself to Emu more vehemently than ever before. The convergence
gained momentum when the government kept its nerve and conceded little during
a series of strikes in December. <BR>
<BR>
The spread turned negative in early May as life insurers, the driving force
of the French market, absorbed savings flowing out of money-market funds
because of low short-term interest rates and rechannelled them into long-term
bonds. This has helped to force prices up and push yields down. And because
international investors are virtually absent from the French market, its
bonds have been insulated from a rise in world bond yields which dragged
down German bond prices. <BR>
<BR>
As a result, many believe that the recent narrowing had more to do with
demand from life insurance companies than increasing optimism about Emu.
The spread between French government bonds and Bunds, it is argued, will
widen in the course of the year because of a tail-off in demand from domestic
investors, especially life insurance companies. &quot;As interest rates
start to climb back up again, this will have an impact on the 10-year yield,&quot;
says Iain Lindsay, an analyst at Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais. &quot;There won't
be the same pressing need to go out of money-market funds into life assurance.&quot;

<H4>EUROPEAN EQUITIES </H4>
<H2>Stock en bloc </H2>
Increasingly, banks are risking large amounts of their capital executing
bought deals in equity markets. In a typical trade, the selling shareholder,
often a government, asks a handful of banks to bid for a line of stock -
perhaps a small residual holding in an actively traded privatization issue.
The bidders calculate a discount (usually narrow) to the prevailing market
price and bid at that price. Successful bidders are usually notified on
the same morning as the auction and may then rush to sell the stock on within
minutes or hours of owning it. <BR>
<BR>
Such high-risk transactions are becoming an ever more familiar feature of
equity markets. &quot;The everyday trading business of buying and selling
so many ICI shares just doesn't pay the bills any more,&quot; says Krishna
Patel, managing director at HSBC James Capel. &quot;Real revenues come from
the bigger deals and bigger risks.&quot; HSBC James Capel has done a large
amount of bought deals in rebalancing international equity portfolios. &quot;Two
years ago, we did one or two block trades of over $100 million,&quot; says
Patel. &quot;This year we have done four that size in a single month, two
of them over $400 million.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Periodically, bought deals become popular, as they did in 1992, when many
European companies unwound cross-holdings in each other that were no longer
important to their business strategies. But many banks have been uncomfortable
executing them because they are difficult to hedge. Even with a considerable
array of equity derivatives, many bankers say that hedging a sudden, huge
exposure to a single stock is difficult. They describe bought deals as simple
exercises in risk-taking and rapid distribution. <BR>
<BR>
But there are occasions when bought deals can be combined with derivatives
transactions. &quot;If you are executing a bought deal for a FT-SE [blue-chip
UK] stock, you can hedge market-specific risk through selling futures and
leave yourself with exposure just to that particular sector,&quot; points
out Mike Hammond, executive director<B> </B>at SBC Warburg. <BR>
<BR>
On occasion, a bank trading equity derivatives may even be driven to seek
out a bought deal. Hammond again: &quot;If a client wants to buy a large
number of call options on a given stock, that may require the selling bank
to buy a large percentage of the stock underlying the option, to fulfill
the bank's delta hedge.&quot; If a bank sells call options worth $200 million,
delta hedging may require it to own, for example, actual stock equivalent
to 50% of its derivatives exposure. If it goes into the open market and
tries to buy $100 million of equity, it risks bidding up the share price.
Better, if possible, to identify a large shareholder which may be willing
to sell a big block at a discount to the market price. <BR>
<BR>
Last month, derivatives trading and block trades came together in a much-publicized
deal in the shares of UK electricity distributor National Grid. Hanson sold
its 12.5% holding to HSBC. But instead of immediately selling those shares
on to institutional clients, as in a normal bought deal, the firm held on
to them. It had bought the shares as part of a transaction with the Olayan
Group, an investment group owned by Saudi investor Suliman Olayan. Olayan
sold the firm put options on the National Grid block and at the same time
bought call options from it. Although it still legally owns the shares,
HSBC has no exposure to rises or falls in the share price. Its only exposure
is counterparty credit risk on the derivatives trades. <BR>
<BR>
Olayan wanted to take full economic and investment exposure to the shares
without becoming their legal owner. It may have viewed derivatives as a
more efficient way to make this investment or it may have had other reasons.
Hanson had not called an auction for its stake. HSBC came to it with the
deal. <BR>
<BR>
Bankers suggest that another bought-deal strategy might be for a bank to
buy a large block of shares at a discount and immediately sell bonds convertible
into those shares at a premium. <BR>
<BR>
In an effort to generate business, banks are regularly trying to worm out
of large shareholders information about whether or not blocks of shares
they own are up for sale. A bank might want to own stocks to balance its
own trading book, if that has too many short positions in a given sector.
Or it may hope to turn stock around quickly. Institutions like buying bought
deals, as they provide them with an easy way to raise their weightings in
a chosen sector without working large orders through the market and moving
prices against them. <BR>
<BR>
Where a bank thinks a stock or a sector is undervalued and that the market
is set to rally, it might bid at very close to the market price for a large
block of shares. Given an extremely bullish view, it might even bid at a
premium. <BR>
<BR>
For the vendor, bought deals may well be cheaper than roadshows and bookbuildings.
If it feels a stock has risen to near its peak, selling out at a discount
of between 1% and 2% may be attractive, especially if it needs to generate
cash quickly to reinvest in other markets. The risk is that if bidding banks
try to circle up a large number of lead orders for a stock and the market
realizes it is for sale, that may depress the price. A problem for banks
is that vendors are quite cagey. One trader says: &quot;They won't just
declare that a block is for sale, because to do so is like giving away a
free put option.&quot; When they do chose to trade, vendors insist on a
tightly controlled process. <BR>
<BR>
A vendor might restrict bidding banks to sounding out just one or two of
their very largest clients before committing to a block trade. One broker
says: &quot;Some firms want to find a buyer for every last share. A few
years ago it was simpler to round up orders before making a bid and so take
the risk out of it. Now, you have to accept that you cannot tie up the whole
transaction in advance.&quot; He <BR>
adds: &quot;In recent years the whole level of risk-taking in the equity
trading business has gone up.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
It's a nerve-racking business for firms desperate to stay in the equity
trading game. One trader at a large American securities firm says: &quot;Bought
deals are the ultimate expression of competition in this business. Let me
tell you, it is no pleasant experience putting such large amounts of the
firm's capital on the line.&quot; <BR>
<BR>

<H4>BANKING RISK </H4>
<H2>Yes, we have bananas </H2>
What most worries senior bankers, their customers, their regulators, and
the observers and analysts who are waiting for them to make their next big
mistake? Their biggest fears are overcapacity in the financial sector and
management failure. Further down the tree come inadequate regulation, the
sheer complexity of the business and, fifth in line, the dread word derivatives.
A surprise bogey at number nine is Japan. <BR>
<BR>
These are the findings of a poll, <I>Banking banana skins iii</I>, by the
London-based Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation (CSFI). A May
1 gathering of those polled showed that, since the questionnaires went out
late last year, the areas of concern have already shifted. Dangerous pressure
on management to produce gross returns in highly competitive markets is
now the overriding discomfort. Under such pressure, chains of command can
break down, opening the way to fraud and other unexpected losses, many participants
warned at the meeting. Meanwhile fears about Japan appear to have lost their
edge. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm surprised at the risks that <I>weren't</I> dwelt on,&quot; says
CSFI director Andrew Hilton, &quot;for example, property, technology and
the move to European monetary union.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The overall concerns are predictable. More interesting is the order of priority
that the various interest groups give them (see chart). Poor management
is the top concern for most and fraud is important to regulators, but end-users
put derivatives at the top of their list and fraud second from bottom. <BR>
<BR>
Flashes of insight appear among the standard observations published in the
CSFI's third report on this subject. Here are a few: &quot;Is there enough
collateral to go round, and how robust is the documentation?&quot;...&quot;There
is a growing divergence between the interests of traders and the interests
of the firm as a whole.&quot;...&quot;Risk management and oversight at the
international level is a major concern.&quot;...&quot;It has yet to be demonstrated
that banks will make a success of conglomerate strategies.&quot;...There
is a risk in the &quot;mismatch in regulation and legal regime between major
financial jurisdictions,&quot; warns one UK official, while another's nightmare
is &quot;the problem of managing a crisis in a large trading firm with a
dynamically-hedged book at a time when the market will not deal with it,
so all the hedging assumptions break down. We will have to find a mechanism
for moving the positions and the risk management into a viable vehicle in
order for the book to be unwound.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
With so much to worry about, when do these people do any work?<B> David

<H3>KERR'S PEOPLE </H3>
<B>Jeremy Amias </B>
<H4>Managing director and head of European fixed income sales, <BR>
Salomon Brothers International</H4> <BR>
<BR>
Among the guest speakers at a seminar for the Association of International
Bond Dealers (now isma), in November 1987, in Montreux were two very young
executives from Salomon Brothers in London. One was Jeremy Amias, now all
of 34 and head of fixed income sales at Salomon in Europe. The other was
Michael Lewis who shot to fame as the author of <I>Liar's Poker</I>. Lewis
who deified the &quot;big swinging dick&quot; salesman and made Salomon
look like a robber baron, is long gone. Amias, whose big swinging attributes
were more demurely exhibited, has prospered. With 12 years at Salomon, he
is a genuine veteran in a firm renowned for high senior executive turnover.
<BR>
<BR>
Amias and Salomon met more by luck than judgement. At Cambridge he read
classics - hardly the perfect pedigree for a ruthless salesman -
and seemed set for a life as a university professor. When finance caught
his eye, he wrote to a number of banks, but admits that his presentations
&quot;were not literary masterpieces&quot;. Even fuddy old National Westminster
Bank wrote to him saying it was not sure about his ability &quot;to handle
large sums of money&quot;. What a shame Amias didn't keep that letter for
future framing. Today, at 34, he earns more money than anyone in the NatWest
group. <BR>
<BR>
In 1984, Salomon, thanks to the initiative of Charlie McVeigh and Sheldon
Prentice, the co-heads of European capital markets, had begun to recruit
Oxbridge graduates. A friend told Amias about the Salomon interest but he
had never heard of the firm. However, perhaps miffed by the NatWest rebuke,
he contacted Salomon and was accepted into the graduate training programme.
<BR>
<BR>
Amias was a year ahead of the class immortalized by Lewis<I>,</I> with its
Japanese participants asleep in every lecture and the weakest members being
told that they would be posted &quot;to sell equities in Dallas&quot;. But
there were some uk notables in the group. Ian Hannam, he of the shadowy
military background, was in the class. Is it true that Ian was found in
those early days not to have a proper us entry visa in his passport? Today
Hannam is a main board director of Robert Fleming. Also among Amias's classmates
was Simon Meadows, a managing director and co-head of capital markets at
cs First Boston, and Steve Roberts who recently left Salomon Brothers to
take over all of Lehman's fixed income sales and trading in Asia. <BR>
<BR>
Even the 1991 us treasury auction scandal, which nearly toppled Salomon,
barely dented Amias's enthusiasm for the firm and for bond sales. He is
fiercely loyal about the firm's traders and openly admits that their skills
are a huge support to the sales group. &quot;Obviously, our traders have
a reputation in the market which means that when a client wants to deal
in size, Salomon will be one of their calls. It must be difficult for a
second division house which cannot offer clients similar facilities,&quot;
he says. <BR>
<BR>
<B>New vigour</B> <BR>
<BR>
The auction scandal is long forgotten. Almost all of the world's major institutions
are Salomon clients. New customers are particularly attracted by the renowned
Salomon bond indices. &quot;Expensive to set up and maintain, but one of
the best calling cards in the business,&quot; comments a former Salomon
managing director. Also the firm's fixed income research has improved. Once,
the undisputed leaders in research under Henry Kaufman, Salomon slipped
somewhat in the early 1990s. Amias maintains that chief economists, John
Lipsky and his team, are almost as well regarded, and considers the firm's
research on emerging markets as second to none. <BR>
<BR>
What about Salomon's new vigour in the new issue markets, an area which
the firm neglected badly in the last four years? Amias is delighted to see
Solly back among the top 10 lead managers: &quot;For the sales force, it's
the perfect opportunity to make a customer call.&quot; The outside perception
was that Salomon's concern for its customers was sometimes secondary to
the firm's own interests. &quot;Not so,&quot; says Amias who travels constantly
visiting clients in Europe and accompanying salesmen on calls. He is quick
to point out the success of Salomon's annual fixed-income client training
seminar to which customers are invited. <BR>
<BR>
Recently married and living in fashionable St John's Wood, Amias skis and
jogs. What makes a good salesman at Salomon Brothers? He mentions numeracy,
perseverance and adaptability with clients. &quot;You have to be equally
at home in the Royal Opera House or bopping at Stringfellows until 4 am.&quot;
Amias may have all of those qualifications, but at Cambridge, he was also
a member of the &quot;Footlights&quot; where he added invaluable acting
and stand-up comedy experience to his sales repertoire. <BR><BR><BR>
<H2>Andrew Fraser </H2>
<B>Former deputy chairman, <BR>
Baring Securities</B> <BR>
<BR>
In the summer of 1990, Baring Securities was on top of the world. The rest
of the financial services industry world was still recovering from the great
equity crash of October 1987. Only Japan seemed immune. The prosperity of
Baring Securities was inextricably linked to the surging Tokyo stock market.
<BR>
<BR>
Three books have been published on the collapse of Barings Group in February
1995. None has mentioned that, at least for a short time, Baring Securities,
&quot;the house that Heath built&quot;, was one of the great investment
banking success stories of the last 25 years. <BR>
<BR>
Christopher Heath, the mercurial salesman with a professional gambler's
instincts, may have built the house, but he had considerable help. He had
been a partner in the socially well-connected but second division Henderson
Crosthwaite. Heath ran a &quot;firm within a firm&quot; specializing in
Japanese and Far East securities. He was extremely successful and certainly
the highest paid partner in h&amp;c. <BR>
<BR>
When a first division calling beckoned, Heath chose Barings although he
was courted by several other houses. The team he chose to build Baring Securities
became an elite group in its own right. Christopher Heath effectively was
&quot;the king&quot;. The principal members of the team were &quot;barons&quot;
which included Richard Greer (who is back working with Heath at his new
firm), Andrew Bayliss, Colin Ring (whose connection with the Kuwait Investment
Office was invaluable), John Bonfield, Diarmaid Kelly and Andrew Fraser.
<BR>
<BR>
Fraser was an exception among the &quot;barons&quot;, being the only non-Japanese
specialist - his forte was the Hong Kong and Far East regional markets.
However, these markets were unimportant as Tokyo continued to rise higher
and higher. Heath had poached almost the whole of Robert Fleming's prized
Japanese convertible and equity warrant trading team led by Trevor Sliwerski
and Nigel Radley, early in 1987. This was a golden period for Japanese equities
and warrants. &quot;After a brief hiccup following the October crash, the
Tokyo market just kept rising,&quot; comments Fraser, &quot;the Fleming
dealers may have been good but there was no secret to making money, as the
only trading strategy required was to be long, fully-leveraged and then
long some more&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
While all Heath's financial roads led to Tokyo, Fraser, Bayliss and some
of the other barons built up the nucleus of a truly international Baring
Securities. Offices were opened in Singapore, Bangkok, Manila, Jakarta,
Kuala Lumpur, and later, in Seoul and Taipei. Fraser likes to point out
the success of those operations today and the fact that despite the collapse
of Barings, the Far Eastern business of Baring Securities is still rated
on a par with Jardine Fleming Securities. &quot;At one stage, we were even
considered to be ahead of Jardine Fleming - not bad when you consider
that they were the Taipan house of the region, had connections going back
more than a century and we were starting from grass roots up.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But Japan was a different story. &quot;In the final stages of the Tokyo
bull market, the profitability of Baring Securities was such that it definitely
became a case of the tail wagging the dog,&quot; says Fraser. <BR>
<BR>
Heath didn't foresee the end of the Tokyo bull run and the subsequent market
collapse. Others at Barings were better prepared: their traders ran major
short positions and managed to keep the firm's head above water. Heath's
headlong expansion into Latin and South America may have showed vision but
they were a cost drain on the profitable east Asian business. The constantly-travelling
Heath was no delegator. &quot;We didn't even have a proper management committee
at Baring Securities until 1992,&quot; recalls Fraser. By 1993, Heath had
been ousted. But Baring Securities, until the Leeson debacle, continued
to operate at a profit (after substantial cost reductions and staff pruning),
and the company franchise, especially in east Asia, remains intact. <BR>
<BR>
Could the success of Baring Securities be repeated today? Heath's new corporate
vehicle, Caspian, is a very different animal from the original bs. Will
Fraser attempt to build a mark ii version? He will shortly be taking a senior
executive role in the old Standard Chartered Securities business recently
sold to a major Thai bank. Fraser will concentrate on the east Asian regional
markets - his original stamping ground. At Baring Securities, now ing
Barings, he believed that the group had lost its focus on the core -
and still profitable - east Asian business. In his new position he
will be based in London which may allow him marginally more time to visit
his Scottish home, and enjoy fishing, shooting and stalking. Will he be
joined by one or more of the former barons who are now scattered around
the globe? <BR><BR><BR>
<H2>Bruno Gabriele </H2>
<B>Co-head, investment banking Europe, <BR>
Lehman Brothers International</B> <BR>
<BR>
Was it simply a matter of being in the right place at the right time? This
is the question friends and competitors asked when Bruno Gabriele, barely
six weeks into a new high-profile career at Lehman Brothers, moved even
higher to be co-head of all the firm's European investment banking operations.
<BR>
<BR>
Lehman's record in Europe had been spotty - remember the mass firings
in the late 1980s, and more recently, the closure of the branch in Lugano
and high staff turnover in Geneva? It put itself back on track then by hiring
a Salomon man - in the unmistakable and hard-driving Dan Tyree, now
ceo of Lehman in Asia. However, the turnaround in fixed income and international
equities moved faster than in European investment banking and corporate
finance. When Lehman lost the feisty Bill Harrison to Robert Fleming, it
lost one of its major deal-makers. Steve Berger who then took over the firm's
European investment banking simply didn't have Harrison's presence or his
formidable list of corporate clients, especially in the uk. <BR>
<BR>
To push Lehman into the premier division of European investment banking,
m&amp;a, corporate finance and advisory work, the firm needed some new faces.
Tyree had worked well for Lehman. Why not look at Salomon again to recruit
a top investment banker, or better still, a group of investment bankers?
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ideal qualifications</B> <BR>
<BR>
Bruno Gabriele must have been an obvious choice for anyone seeking to raid
Salomon Brothers in London. Then only 35, but already a managing director,
he was the moving force on the international side of Salomon's financial
institutions group. When Salomon lost its way in the aftermath of the 1991
treasury auction scandal, and then again in 1994, the reputation of the
financial institutions group remained totally unblemished. In this specialist
sector, where business was booming and the firm's equity research was still
among the best, Salomon was perhaps the first call for raising capital and
advisory work. <BR>
<BR>
Gabriele has ideal qualifications for being a banker's investment banker.
His father was a senior international executive with Banca di Roma for 35
years. He started, like so many others who have shot up the ladder, with
Citicorp where he worked for six years before joining Salomon in 1986. Salomon's
bankers in the financial institutions group, including Kenny Wilson, Dick
Barrett, Bob Nan and Gerry Smith, had built up excellent relationships with
the money centre banks and other core clients including Republic National
Bank. There was also plenty of business in continental Europe. Gabriele
worked on some major transactions, including the privatization of Compagnie
Financi&egrave;re de Suez, the bank-insurance joint venture between axa
and bbv, and the rescue and subsequent sale of Banesto to Banco Santander.
There were also smaller but personally satisfying transactions such as the
purchase, and the sale six years later, of Banca Steinhauslin (a small private
bank in Florence) on behalf of Creditanstalt - &quot;the only bank
I bought and sold on behalf of the same client,&quot; recalls Gabriele.
<BR>
<BR>
Why leave Salomon for Lehman? By 1995 Salomon was beginning to get itself
out of a trough, but Gabriele found himself at odds with the firm's investment
banking strategy and he admits: &quot;I had stopped having fun.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
When Gabriele answered Lehman's call, he immediately took four senior Salomon
colleagues with him - Thomas Marsoner, Antonio Villalon, Nick Lyons
and Martin Dolan. Like the Pied Piper he attracted a total of 20 Solly employees,
including five executive directors, two directors, nine associates and two
analysts. <BR>
<BR>
Did Gabriele expect to be promoted to co-head of all European investment
banking within weeks of his arrival at Lehman? &quot;Certainly not,&quot;
he asserts. But, as Lehman might have hoped, there is a new resolve about
the firm's investment banking efforts in Europe and in other areas such
as Israel, where Lehman is a major force. Specifically, Lynch and Gabriele
are targeting European telecom and media, energy and utilities, financial
institutions and health-care. And equity research, an area where Lehman's
commitment in Europe has often seemed half-hearted, is no longer neglected.
In the last six months, Lehman has been on a buying spree recruiting analysts
from csfb, Robert Fleming, Gencor, Merrill Lynch and, of course, Salomon.
<BR>
<BR>
Gabriele himself remains firmly in the front line working with Cariplo (a
former client of Salomon) and on Lehman's defence assignments for Banca
Popolare di Novara, and is determined to extend the firm's investment banking
successes in Italy to Spain, Portugal and France.  <p>

<H3>Europe's hidden jewels </H3>

<H4>If you are a big bank on the hunt for smaller fish to swallow up, where
do you look? Banks that show no potential for creativity or filling gaps
in market coverage are unlikely to figure as your acquisition targets. That's
particularly true if they are going through a bad patch. But your prey may
turn out to be on the hunt themselves. Banks that have sharpened up by hauling
themselves out of disaster are often as likely to be potential acquirers
as acquisitions. The same is true of those that have been long-term successes
because of imaginative and efficient exploitation of product or regional
niches. Then there are the banks that look too big to be acquired but seem
uncertain or cautious about punching their weight. We look here at eight
European banks with plenty to shout about but at least a hint of ambiguity
about where they are heading. Brian Caplen, Laura Covill, Desmond Crowley,
Philip Moore, Nick Kochan and Jules Stewart report </H4>


<H3>Royal Bank of Scotland: balanced earnings </H3>

The Royal Bank of Scotland is a constant source of ambiguous takeover rumours.
Some say it is going to be acquired; others that it is planning to make
a purchase. The stories are fuelled by the view that the Royal Bank of Scotland
Group (RBSG) is too small to compete effectively - it stands about
100th in the global banking asset league table. <BR>
<BR>
But there's solid evidence that being small has enabled RBSG both to move
quickly and to keep its eye on the ball when new projects are under development.
The success of its innovative telephone insurance subsidiary, Direct Line,
which revolutionized the UK insurance market, is one example. Another is
its ability to develop a retail banking operation in the US, an area that
that has proved troublesome for other UK banks. Both Direct Line and US
subsidiary Citizens Financial contributed about 20% to RBSG's 1995 profits,
although increased competition in the insurance sector and higher claims
because of bad weather mean Direct Line's contribution will be down in 1996.
At the halfway stage to the end of March, however, the traditional UK banking
business came to the rescue, contributing &#163;246 million ($381 million)
to group pre-tax profits of &#163;301 million, showing that RBSG's attempts
to diversify earnings are now paying dividends. <BR>
<BR>
But whether RBSG's ventures are successful or not, as long as worldwide
banking consolidation is under way, speculation about its independence will
continue. Early this year press articles suggested that HSBC was interested
in buying the bank and had made an informal approach. Twelve years ago RBSG
fought off a bid from the UK's Lloyds Bank and the logic that one of the
UK clearing banks (HSBC owns Midland) would be enticed by a Scottish retail
network has persisted, although there could be political hurdles. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The political ramifications of an English bank taking over Scottish
retail branches would be huge,&quot; says Norrie Morrison, banking analyst
with Nikko Europe. Says RBSG financial director Bob Speirs: &quot;We want
to remain an independent bank based in Edinburgh.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
On the expansion side, RBSG is reported to have been interested in acquiring
the large UK building society Woolwich and was named as a possible buyer
of a 32.5% stake in the Bank of Scotland put on the block by Standard Life.
Those are the rumours - the reality of the bank's growth strategy is
duller but probably sounder as regards securing future earnings. <BR>
<BR>
In April Citizens Financial merged with the Bank of Ireland's subsidiary
in New England, First NH Bank, creating a group with over $14 billion in
assets, a seven-fold increase in size since RBSG first bought Citizens almost
a decade ago. Since 1992 nine acquisitions have been undertaken by Citizens,
culminating in the recent acquisition of Connecticut-based Farmers &amp;
Mechanics Bank. The simple philosophy has been to stick to a defined geographical
area rather than trying to tackle huge swathes of the US market. &quot;If
the head office is more than 100 miles from Providence [the Rhode Island
base of Citizens], we don't do the deal,&quot; says Speirs. &quot;It's important
to be able to get there and back in a day.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In Europe, RBSG increased its stake in the Spanish commercial bank Banco
Santander from 1.4% to 4.9% between December and May. Santander in turn
holds 9.89% of Royal Bank. Too small to make dramatic expansions in Europe,
RBSG has concentrated on developing ties with existing banks and has built
up the Ibos cross-border payments system, which has been dubbed &quot;the
virtual bank&quot;. This includes Goldman Sachs, Chase and Banco Santander
among its members. Chase is also a user of the system. <BR>
<BR>
A report on the bank by UK-based ratings agency IBCA notes that earnings
are &quot;far more balanced than they were even two years ago&quot; and
that &quot;RBSG's fortunes are tied far less to the performance of its core
domestic banking business than was previously the case&quot;. Earlier this
year IBCA raised the bank's long-term rating to AA. 

<H3>BHF Bank: always seeking niches </h3>

BHF wins the award for foresight: in 1994 it was the first German bank to
spot - and reject - the trend towards global status. Most other
German banks have since hastened to follow, eagerly denying any global ambitions
in favour of attractive niches. </H3>
Never mind that global significance is out of the question for this bank
anyway. BHF Bank is barred from the big league because of its modest assets
- Dm74 billion ($50 billion) - and net earnings of only Dm377
billion last year. Wolfgang Strutz, chairman of the board of management,
claims he likes to watch competitors getting bigger because their sheer
size increases BHF's niche opportunities. <BR>
<BR>
Deutsche Bank caused much excitement in German banking last month by announcing
that it would reorganize into four divisions. But BHF Bank made a similar
move two years ago, albeit on a smaller scale. In the early 1980s BHF junked
some standardized bulk business, then scrambled on for a few years without
any real strategic direction. Since 1994 it has had three divisions: private
banking and asset management, capital markets and corporate banking. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The German merchant bank&quot; is a flattering label which was attached
to BHF many years ago and still comes in handy when the bank makes one of
its occasional investments in a foreign capital market. Following strategic
alliances with Charterhouse in London, Cr&eacute;dit Commercial de France
(CCF) and Zivnostenska Banka of the Czech Republic in the early 1990s, BHF
and CCF have recently each bought a 30% stake in Equinox, a new merchant
bank in Hong Kong and Singapore. <BR>
<BR>
A bank with more appetite for power would have secured control of all these
institutions. Instead, BHF has restricted its interest to minorities: 45%
of Charterhouse, 46.9% of Zivnostenska and 2% of CCF. <BR>
<BR>
Since most sizeable banks in Germany still engage in every type of business,
BHF tends to emphasize the things it doesn't do. Lending is restricted to
large loans in order to contain administrative costs, and syndicated loans
are granted only in the short and medium term to reduce risk. The private-client
division deals only with individuals who have liquid wealth of more than
Dm500,000, and private banking head Louis Graf von Zech would like to raise
this to Dm1 million. <BR>
<BR>
BHF was also one of the first German banks to introduce performance-related
pay and even finder's fees for those in corporate business. That has attracted
young managers from the best names: last year Alfred M&ouml;ckel joined
the eight-man board as head of equities - he was previously a senior
manager at Morgan Stanley's Frankfurt operation. <BR>
<BR>
BHF Bank still has a strong franchise in all its businesses, but Strutz
knows that these niches may not last for ever. The BHF Bank share price
is crawling along, gaining only 4.5% last year and thus underperforming
Germany's 30-share Dax index. And institutional investors have yet to be
persuaded that German banks occupying niches are an attractive long-term
bet. As a result, BHF is viewed as one of Germany's prime candidates for
takeover. <BR>
<BR>
Moreover the bank's fate depends not so much on its management as on powerful
shareholders, particularly the Allianz insurance group which holds the biggest
stake - over 15%. Allianz also holds substantial shareholdings in Dresdner
Bank and Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel Bank. The smaller bank may become
a pawn if Allianz decides to initiate mergers in German banking. 
<H3>Rabobank: outward-looking cooperative </H3>
Rabobank never fails to mention its triple-A rating: its credit quality
has become as much a part of its identity as its ownership by farmers and
tradesmen in the Dutch provinces. But can the Netherlands' second-largest
bank make much use of this rare asset? As a cooperative, Rabobank cannot
raise new capital via public markets and an equity issue has never been
seriously considered. <BR>
<BR>
Rabobank's capital ratio of 12% is the best in the business but is put to
meagre use supporting a timid lending policy and a balance sheet still based
overwhelmingly in the Netherlands and in corporate business. <BR>
<BR>
The bank's management has now announced an initiative to double in size
its special niche in international agribusiness, a sector worth $5 trillion
a year. Financing hospitals, in which Rabo is already well established in
the Netherlands and the US, is another promising niche. <BR>
<BR>
All non-Dutch activities have been incorporated into a new subsidiary known
as Rabobank International, which will include the bank's entire international
business and its issuing activities, and will therefore be given a full
guarantee by Rabobank Group. Its ambition is to double business volume to
Fls200 billion ($120 billion) within four years. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Expensive international ambitions</B> <BR>
<BR>
To achieve that goal, however, Rabo will have to be more adventurous with
its capital. The new operation needs Fls1.5 billion in additional capital
immediately - that will be contributed by the Rabobank Group -
but will have to add a further Fls2 billion out of its own retained profits
by 2000. <BR>
<BR>
Rabo's new international ambitions will not only be expensive, but will
also involve the bank in new types of risk. The credit rating agencies are
watching closely but remain sanguine. &quot;Our forecast for Rabobank's
rating is negative. But the negative outlook has been there for the past
five years,&quot; says Dan Martin, a banking analyst at credit-rating agency
Standard &amp; Poor's. <BR>
<BR>
This reorganization is the climax of quiet change that has been going on
for five years. Like other banks, Rabobank has caught investment banking
fever, and is planning to hire more staff in capital and money markets.
Arthur Arnold, head of Rabobank International, says he may even acquire
an international capital markets house with particular strength in fixed
income. <BR>
<BR>
Arnold insists that any new subsidiary will have to fit in with Rabo's own
culture, which has traditionally favoured believers in the cooperative ethic
over masters of the universe. But a number of staff hired recently from
ABN Amro in Amsterdam have been hooked by the traditional draw of large
salaries, as well as greater authority in a smaller capital markets operation.
<BR>
<BR>
As one Rabobank source says: &quot;We're not a hit-and-run bank, even in
the money markets. We are more loyal and conservative than ING, and less
structured than ABN Amro. There's no short-term goal because Rabobank does
not need to maximize profits.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Since the launch of Rabobank International, that disdain for hard cash appears
a little old-fashioned. Even though Rabobank has no shareholders that need
to be pleased, chairman Herman Wijffels has said that net earnings will
now need to grow by at least 8% to 10% every year to keep capitalization
at the same level. <BR>
<BR>
Expecting success, Wijffels has already shown his hand for the next move.
He foresees an international holding, owned by Rabo and a banking partner
from one or several other European countries (banks that aren't cooperatives
are being considered too). That new creature might become Europe's first
cross-border borrower, just in time for the launch of the single currency.
<H3>Banco Ambroveneto: rebirth and resurgence </H3>
For a bank whose origins date back to a scandal which made BCCI look squeaky
clean by comparison, Italy's Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto) has grown
and prospered with astonishing speed. When the chairman of the old Banco
Ambrosiano, Roberto Calvi, was found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in
London in 1982, the discredited institution was collapsing with debts of
around $1.3 billion. Today the reconstructed bank is one of Italy's fastest
growing and most profitable. It also has muscle and last year cocked a snook
at the mighty Mediobanca empire when it fended off an unwelcome takeover
bid from Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI). <BR>
<BR>
In any other country one would have expected the name Ambrosiano to have
been given a quick and decent burial. Not so in scandal-hardened Italy.
The Nuovo Banco Ambrosiano - new Ambrosiano bank - quickly took
shape in 1982 as a vehicle for protecting depositors in the old collapsed
bank and has barely looked back since. At the end of 1989 it merged with
Banca Cattolica del Veneto (BCV) to form Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto).
In 1995 its rebirth was more or less completed when it raised its stake
in the investment bank Caboto Sim to 100%, quickly ensuring that it would
be well positioned to benefit from Italy's rapidly expanding asset management
business. <BR>
<BR>
Today, according to a recent bulletin from credit-rating agency IBCA, Ambroveneto
ranks 10th in Italy in terms of consolidated assets. It has a network of
597 domestic branches, 97 of which have been opened since 1993. More important
than its size, however, is the fact that Ambroveneto was among the first
of Italy's banks to recognize the importance of profitability and return
on equity (ROE). In a country in which most banks post ROE returns among
the lowest in Europe (in the 2% to 4% range), Ambroveneto boasted a 1995
ROE of 7.94% and its target for 1996 is &quot;at least&quot; 10%. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;One of the advantages we had is that out of necessity we started our
restructuring process about five years before most other <BR>
Italian banks even started thinking about it,&quot; says Gigliola Zecchi,
head of the international division at Ambroveneto's headquarters in Milan.
<BR>
<BR>
The restructuring strategy appears to have concentrated on three key areas.
First, Ambroveneto has always focused its lending on the more creditworthy
private sector, unlike other Italian banks, which have channelled lending
towards large state-owned conglomerates because of extreme political pressure.
At the end of December 1995 only 1.5% of its loan book was exposed to &quot;government
entities&quot;, with 20% going to what the bank describes as &quot;artisans&quot;
(craftsmen and family businesses), and 48.4% to smaller and medium-sized
businesses. <BR>
<BR>
Second, although its roots are in the wealthier north of Italy, Ambroveneto
has sought to become a nationwide bank through judicious acquisition. It
has, for example, expanded into the south where rewards but also risks are
higher than in the north. Through the acquisition of 47 branches of Citibank
Italia and a series of other purchases, around 20% of its branches are now
in the south. Competitors suggest that Ambroveneto may seek to bolster this
share still further through a stake in the troubled Banco di Napoli. <BR>
<BR>
Third, through its commitment to the Caboto Group, which is managed separately
from the bank, Ambroveneto is seeking to ensure that it will be well equipped
to meet increased competition from international firms when the integrated
European investment services directive belatedly comes into effect in Italy.
Michele Calzolari, director general of the Caboto Sim, makes no secret of
the fact that asset management is potentially the most lucrative of the
three areas in which Caboto is active, the others being equity broking and
government bond trading. But he adds: &quot;Among Italian companies we are
the largest in terms of trading volume in government debt. We've been ranked
number five in volume [the leading four are all US houses], but number two
as far as the quality of our research, spreads and execution are concerned.
In this business we certainly believe we can compete with the major international
players. As far as the equity market is concerned, competition will become
much greater. In three or four years' time there will probably be only 10
or 15 Italian Sims that are active in the market - and we fully intend
to be one of them.&quot; 
<H3>Bayerische Vereinsbank: commitment to the region </H3>
Despite all the publicity about Deutsche Bank's 5.2% stake in Bayerische
Vereinsbank, reports of an impending takeover are not so much premature
as plain wrong. Vereinsbank prides itself on having a stable group of shareholders
that do not sell or even bother to flaunt their power very much. <BR>
<BR>
As far as Vereinsbank is concerned, Deutsche is just another institutional
shareholder looking for security and reasonable long-term earnings. Simply
by announcing its shareholding, Deutsche Bank pushed up the value of its
Dm500 million ($338 million) investment by 15% in a few days. The jump in
the share price, which Deutsche must have foreseen, may be a sign that Deutsche
is not intending to buy any more Vereinsbank stock. <BR>
<BR>
The chances are that Deutsche and other powerful shareholders will go on
letting Vereinsbank do what it does best. While losing its triple-A rating
from credit-rating agency Moody's in April, Vereinsbank still has a strong
base in corporate and retail banking in southern Germany, and a substantial
franchise in mortgage banking. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Focus on a core region</B> <BR>
<BR>
Its assets of Dm356 billion are considerable, even though the balance sheet
is inflated by mortgage loans. Despite its size, Vereinsbank (it tends to
drop the Bayerische - Bavarian - label for international audiences)
is still a niche player. The outer reaches of what it calls its &quot;core
region&quot; in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic may have been marked
in Bavarian blue and white on the map, but Vereinsbank's corporate and retail
bankers have yet to make their mark there as permanent colonists. <BR>
<BR>
The Moody's downgrade came as a blow to Vereinsbank, but the credit rating
agency's misgivings were with German banking generally and not with Vereinsbank
specifically. According to Moody's, Vereinsbank has been innovative in creating
new products, but structural changes in German banking will adversely affect
its earnings power in the medium term. <BR>
<BR>
It is a boon, therefore, that unlike Commerzbank - its closest rival
in terms of size in Germany - Vereinsbank has few pretensions to market
share outside southern Germany and will therefore be spared the expense
that goes with that commitment. <BR>
<BR>
Using the same logic, Bayerische Vereinsbank has resisted the move to London
made by many other German banks and relocated its trading room to Munich
instead. The bank hopes this will attract first-rate traders and deal-makers
who enjoy skiing in the winter and Alpine hiking in summer. 
<H3>Christiania Bank: rebounding from crisis </H3>
Christiania Bank is Norway's second-largest bank (the largest being Den
Norske Bank) and is one of the great survivors of the country's banking
sector. It has rebounded strongly after nearly going bankrupt in the early
1990s and being acquired by the government. With Christiania back from the
dead the government has been steadily selling down its stake - today
it owns 51.1%. <BR>
<BR>
At the forefront of Christiania's priorities has been cost-cutting, especially
in salaries. This has proved more effective than anyone in Oslo expected.
It partially accounts for a very healthy Nkr562 million ($88 million) profit
in the first quarter, which, says Per Munk-Nielsen, an analyst at broker
Carnegie, was some way ahead of market expectations. Profits for 1995 also
confirmed the bank's strength. Operating profits before loan losses and
write-downs rose by Nkr122 million to Nkr1,728 million. This was an increase
of over Nkr100 million on the previous year. <BR>
<BR>
Growing net interest income - from 2.61% in 1994 to 2.68% last year
- contributed greatly to the improving picture. Norway's stronger property
sector has also allowed Christiania to reduce its provisions to the point
where some have been written back into the balance sheet. &quot;The balance
sheet looks fairly healthy, if not very exciting,&quot; says Munk-Nielsen.
&quot;It is quite a success story, but it has come from a very low base.
Christiania is a very well-established bank in a mature market.&quot; The
bank has managed to bring down bad debts considerably, and it has built
up its commission and fee earnings, says Munk-Nielsen. <BR>
<BR>
The impressive rebirth of Christiania has been consolidated with last year's
acquisition of mortgage institution Norgeskreditt Holding for Nkr2.6 billion.
The brokers say this has been integrated more quickly and easily than forecasted.
More synergies than expected have been found between the bank and Norgeskreditt.
Norgeskreditt's mortgage loans will account for about a quarter of the bank's
total earnings, and this is expected to reduce the risk in Christiania's
lending portfolio and stabilize the bank's income. <BR>
<BR>
While cost-cutting has proved extremely effective, Christiania suffers along
with Norway's other institutions from a shortage of lending opportunities,
which puts a cap on the profitability of all Norwegian banks. <BR>
<BR>
Christiania's improving financial performance is reflected in its ratings.
Moody's has raised its long-term rating from A3 to A2 and its short-term
from P2 to P1. Standard &amp; Poor's has moved its short-term rating from
A3 to A2. <BR>
<BR>
The bank has recently taken a number of steps to reassure its investors.
These have included issuing $150 million of subordinated loans. The bank
has said it intends in the medium term to raise its core capital ratio from
a minimum of 6% to 7%. In the longer term the aim is to bring the ratio
in line with major European banks. 
<H3>La Caixa: mutual interests </H3>
Will she or won't she? That's the big question hanging over La Caixa, the
giant Barcelona-based savings bank that accounts for 9% of Spain's customer
deposits. Speculation has been mounting that Spanish savings banks -
La Caixa in particular - may be flirting with the idea of abandoning
mutual status, becoming public companies that have stock market listings.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's still a remote possibility and, in the case of La Caixa, it is
an especially complex process since it would involve the regional Catalan
government,&quot; says Jose Sevilla, head of research at Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets in Madrid. Sevilla points out that ironically it is La Caixa's relatively
low level of profitability - about 13.5% compared with an average of
more than 15% for the Spanish banking sector - which allows it to pursue
a policy of aggressive expansion. &quot;If you have a high level of profitability
and are accountable to shareholders, you have to be a good deal more careful
about how you spend your money,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
For the moment, La Caixa's results suggest that there is no pressing need
to go public. Pre-tax profits soared by 34.6% to Pta26 billion ($20.5 million)
in the first quarter compared with the same period in the previous year.
Indeed, the entire savings bank sector is showing a much healthier profile
than commercial bank competitors. This is the first year that Spanish savings
banks, with total deposits of Pta270 billion, have not been required to
contribute to the state deposit guarantee fund. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We do not feel there is any need to change our statute of mutuality,&quot;
says Antonio Brufau, La Caixa's deputy general manager. &quot;We are steadily
gaining market share, and about 1,200 of our 1,800 branch offices are located
outside our home base of Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. We are growing
in this market at the rate of some 200 new branches a year.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Since 1990, when the government lifted restrictions on savings banks' expansion
outside their home regions, La Caixa has spent more than Pta65 billion in
acquiring regional banks Banco Herrero and Banco Granda Jerez. The group's
foreign operations are limited to its closest neighbours, where it is active
in a range of activities from private banking to retail operations. It has
10% of Portuguese retail bank Banco de Investimento, a 50:50 joint venture
in Monaco with Banque Internationale &agrave; Luxembourg, five private banking
branch offices in Andorra as well as a 30% stake in a local bank and 50
savings bank offices in France. <BR>
<BR>
La Caixa, along with a number of commercial banks, has also been active
in Spain's privatization programme, and now controls 5.1% of Telefonica
and 3% of oil and gas company Repsol. This is in line with its stated policy
of investing part of its equity in infrastructure and services such as motorways,
water, gas and telecommunications. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We believe we can double our Spanish market share in the next five
years,&quot; says Brufau. &quot;We would not be averse to looking at another
acquisition in Spain if something interesting came up. But basically our
future expansion will be through organic growth.&quot; 
<H3>Bank of Ireland: astute public relations </H3>
Bank of Ireland has developed a strong following over the last few years
as a &quot;niche bank&quot; - the niche, in this case, being the Irish
economy. The bank has taken full advantage of the positive perception of
the Irish economy abroad. For overseas investors, buying shares in the bank
was the cleanest way of investing in the &quot;Celtic tiger&quot;. Last
year, 76.8% of the bank's pre-tax profits came from Ireland - in comparison
its main Irish rival, AIB Group, had Irish profits of 48.7%. <BR>
<BR>
Under Pat Molloy, its chief executive, the bank has pushed its share price
from 105p (Irish pence) in 1987 to a high of 496p this year. He has been
acclaimed for merging the bank's small but, in the past, troublesome interests
in New Hampshire with those of the Royal Bank of Scotland. This reduced
the American outpost to the status of an investment rather than a subsidiary
and also helped to make Bank of Ireland look highly focused to investment
institutions. <BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, investors were told last year that the bank had no objections
to using its I&#163;600 million ($971 million) of surplus capital for a
share buy-in. Its 200-year-old constitution, they were also told, would
be changed to make a takeover possible. The bank, of course, had no real
intention of being taken over or of doing a share buy-in, but institutional
investors liked hearing that there were no prejudices against either move.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Keeping a clean image</B> <BR>
<BR>
Such astute public relations counted a great deal in boosting the share
price. The bank's image with institutions was also kept clean by the levels
of the salaries paid to its four executive directors, which were not considered
excessive: they averaged I&#163;188,750 ($305,500) each last year. The bank
was also generous in its dividend policy, which will see the payout per
share doubling in the period from 1994 to 1998. <BR>
<BR>
The bank recently decided to use its I&#163;600 million surplus capital
to make a bid for UK building society Bristol &amp; West. When it is completed,
this will take the bank's interest in housing loans to well over half of
its book. The bid reinforced its image as a cautious high-flyer. Although
the market was disappointed with the second half pre-tax profits for the
1995-96 financial year, earnings forecasts have not been substantially pared
back. According to stockbroker Goodbody, the absorption of Bristol &amp;
West will bring earnings per share growth to 16.7% in the following year.
The broker also said that the bank is generating sufficient capital to rebuild
its ratios rapidly following the purchase of Bristol &amp; West and return
on equity will remain high. <BR>
<BR>
It could be said that Bank of Ireland is now switching from one niche to
another. Through a combination of clever public relations and practical
achievements, it has made itself look like the simplest and most effective
way of investing in Ireland. In fact, within Ireland, it engages in almost
every type of banking operation in the Irish niche, from bank assurance
to retailing to merchant banking. It also has the most successful international
asset management in Ireland. <BR>
<BR>
For the future, attention will be on the house-lending niche, an area in
which it has been very successful in Ireland. The hope is that the bank's
existing house mortgage company in Britain will be able to cut the cost
of Bristol &amp; West's funding, which now come largely from the money markets.
The intention is also to market banking products through Bristol &amp; West.

<H3>AGAINST THE TIDE </H3>
<H2>Time to think the unthinkable </H2>
<h4>by David Roche</H4> 
Of course, senior EU politicians daren't even think about it. Most of them
still see Europe's future in terms of the Maastricht treaty's objectives.
But as I argued in this column last month, it's odds-on the timetable for
European monetary union (Emu) will have to be put back. What happens to
Europe then? Is it Armageddon, as German chancellor Helmut Kohl sometimes
seems to suggest. I think not. <BR>
<BR>
But my optimism depends on the EU's single market surviving the demise of
Emu. The single market is the foundation of internal commerce, designed
in the mid-1980s for completion in 1992. There are still many barriers,
but they get smaller each year. <BR>
<BR>
Supporters of a single currency say Emu is essential to the single market.
True, big swings in real exchange rates in the EU would encourage business
in strong-currency countries to press for import controls. But trade flows
fairly freely between the US and Canada (and increasingly with Mexico),
and these countries have separate currencies. There is a danger that frustrated
fans of Maastricht might use the absence of a single currency as an excuse
for weakening the single market, but there is no logical reason why they
should do so. <BR>
<BR>
With the single market intact, what might happen to Europe's monetary and
currency arrangements? <BR>
<BR>
<I>Option 1</I> The exchange rate mechanism (ERM), or something like it,
is recreated with national currencies held in narrow bands against one another,
but changeable by agreement (and market pressure). That's the talk of the
recent Verona meeting of EU finance ministers. <I>Probability - unlikely:</I>
Option 1 was successful in the 1980s, disastrous in the 1990s. The consensus
is that a new version of ERM is not durable. It is an effective crash diet
(France in 1983-86, the UK in 1989-91), but not a way of life. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Option 2</I> A single-currency core involving a few countries is formed,
with the rest outside, semi-fixed or floating. <I>Probability - highly
unlikely:</I> it won't work. First, who would want to be in the core? Once
the convergence criteria cease to be treated as automatic qualifications
for winning the prize of a single currency, governments will probably think
very hard before wanting to join the contest at all. Second, the core single
currency would not be the Deutschmark, so it would presumably include some
of the weaknesses now associated with the other joiners, and would suffer
in comparison with the Swiss franc, perhaps with others. Third, unless fiscal
transfers are in prospect, non-core countries will be reluctant to join.
But if transfers are required, Germany will be leery. Even those that wanted
to join at some stage would face transitional dilemmas. And prevarication
would increase uncertainty and thus currency instability. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Option 3</I> All EU currencies float freely, with national central banks
and finance ministries following their own policies. <I>Probability -
most likely:</I> as yet, no EU government dares acknowledge this option.
National currencies are maintained and governments are free to choose how
to manage them. But, for various reasons (anti-inflation, trade harmony,
habit), a fair amount of stability is achieved. It's not unlike the EU of
the past two or three years, since the narrow ERM bands were suspended in
August 1993. The big difference - abandonment of the fiction that Emu
is impending. <BR>
<BR>
Some countries would still seek close currency links: the guilder or Belgian
franc with the Deutschmark, for example, and the escudo with the peseta.
But much else might change. In particular, the French would not be obsessed
with maintaining a specific foreign exchange parity or range against the
Deutschmark. They might want broad secular stability for the franc, but
within that they would operate on the basis of other concerns and policy
options. If the EU evolves this way, there will be several broad consequences
for Europe. <BR>
<BR>
First, those countries that are not currently struggling to meet convergence
criteria would have the least disruption to their currencies. The Deutschmark,
guilder, Schilling and sterling would be little affected by the dying of
the Emu dream. The lira and French and Belgian francs will all get a bad
shock (initially a fall). <BR>
<BR>
Second, Europe's growth rate would pick up as the exchange rate focus faded
- good for equities, but generally not for bonds. <BR>
<BR>
Third, a sense of fiscal crisis would break out across Europe. At the moment,
governments think their fiscal challenge consists of getting their 1997
budget deficits below 3% of GDP (a Maastricht criterion for Emu). Things
are far worse than that. The real European dilemma has never been adequately
defined by the Maastricht criteria. It concerns the size of government.
The proportion of GDP accounted for by state expenditure is 15% or more
higher in EU states than in the US, stifling economic dynamism. A few countries
may be good at meeting the longer-term need to curb current spending: Ireland
(demographics are favourable), the UK (a tradition of funded pensions) and
perhaps Spain. But most face wrenching change in the role of government.
They hate the prospect. Their bond markets will reflect the high cost of
capital. <BR>
<BR>
Fourth, national cycles would return. In 1993-95 the UK grew twice as fast
as Germany, whereas France's growth was almost identical to Germany's. This
was not because of trade dependence. It was because British monetary policy
could go its own way. <BR>
<BR>
Fifth, despite being freer to inflate, most countries will probably resist
the temptation. Just as the US, Japan, Australia, Canada and many others
choose to be on a low-inflation tack, so most EU countries would do the
same. The real equity winners in Europe will be individual companies that
globalize successfully and divorce themselves from their respective national
models. They are the ones that make what they produce where it is profitable
to do so and sell it where it pays to. <BR>

<B>The perils of going Dutch</B>
</H2>
<P>
At 2pm on a Monday afternoon in mid-October, senior representatives of 10 of the Euroloan market's leading commercial banks gathered at Voorlinden at Wassenaar, near The Hague. They had not come to admire Voorlinden's impressive gardens and stately setting. It was the treasury officials of Dutch telephone company KPN and its loan arranger Goldman Sachs who commanded everyone's attention on the afternoon of October 14.

<P>
Several bankers nearly didn't make it, wrong-footed by the last-minute change of venue needed to accommodate all those wanting to attend. Lenders' meetings in this market are normally mundane affairs, but a surprisingly large number of senior bankers decided to see for themselves a presentation that promised to be eventful. 

<P>
Two weeks earlier, a cry of dismay had risen from the loan market, when first-time borrower KPN made the unusual choice of Goldman Sachs &#173; not recognized as a top arranger of syndicated loans for European corporations &#173; to lead the jumbo Fl2.25 billion takeover financing to support its agreed acquisition of Australia-based TNT.

<P>
KPN's decision to award a sole mandate to the US investment bank would by itself have caused commercial bankers' emotions to run high. But by also opting for Goldman's innovative Dutch auction technique, the borrower caused more of a stir than it could possibly have expected. It quickly aroused an unprecedented show of commercial bank solidarity and intense irritation. 

<P>
The proposal Goldman originally put to the market, defended with vigour by KPN treasury officials at the meeting, asked 10 banks to bid on price for underwriting commitments of Fl320 million each on the loan. The sixth most competitive bid would price the deal. That would be enough to subscribe the loan, assuming Goldman also kept an underwriting of Fl320 million. The four widest bidders would be left to consider joining a later sell-down in junior roles.

<P>
Goldman Sachs itself had fully underwritten the loan, but was not prepared to tell the market at what level it had done so &#173; although this was eventually rumoured to have been 13 basis points over Libor, not particularly aggressive for a highly rated telephone company. 

<P>
Of the 10 banks approached &#173; ABN Amro, Citibank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Dresdner Bank, Generale Bank, ING Bank, JP Morgan, Rabobank, SBC Warburg and Union Bank of Switzerland &#173; many felt outraged both by the structure and at being spurned by a client with which they had close commercial banking relationships. 

<P>
With Goldman Sachs acting as financial adviser to KPN for the acquisition, normal practice would be for one or two top commercial banks to be appointed arrangers and underwriters for the senior debt portion of the financing. Goldman apparently talked KPN into mandating it alone to underwrite the loan with a view to further reducing the cost to the company by holding the auction. No doubt Goldman suggested that this was the best way to keep the entire transaction under wraps and ensure no last-minute pre-merger leaks. News of the deal came like a bolt of lightning to KPN's relationship banks.

<P>
The structure pays Goldman full fees for arranging and underwriting at the back-stop price. The benefits of tighter pricing resulting from the auction pass to the borrower. Competition between banks for assets and desire to protect relationships would likely produce a deal comfortably inside 13bp over Libor. Angry bankers ask why, if Goldman is such a top-flight loan arranger, it could not immediately price the deal at the market level and syndicate it. They were in no mood to lend their balance sheets in the form of Fl320 million underwriting commitments to an investment bank yet to establish a reputation as a leading arranger of finely priced syndicated bank finance.

<P>
Market talk suggests that Goldman has proposed this auction structure, without success, to several other European corporate clients. At least one treasurer confides that he rejected the concept out of hand as a cumbersome and expensive way to raise money from banks whose price limits he already knows extremely well. 

<P>
KPN, as a debutante in the syndicated loan market, clearly did not appreciate all these sensitivities. To date, its main experience had been three bilateral standby facilities worth some Fl750 million in total. The scene was set for a fiery meeting. 

<P>
According to those who attended, KPN's chief financial officer and treasurer gave a polished performance explaining the benefits of the TNT deal to the KPN group and its shareholders. But the audience was far less impressed when it came to their potential roles in the financing. The atmosphere turned aggressive when KPN officials scolded the banks for the unflattering publicity the deal was receiving. 

<P>
Commercial banks wanted answers to tough questions on pricing and syndication strategy. The KPN officials turned the platform over to Goldman Sachs, which failed to give comprehensive answers and said it would report back to banks individually later. KPN officials must have looked on in alarm. Goldman was suggesting that eventual pricing should be well below 10bp over Libor. Just what comparable companies did Goldman think they had been lending to at such rates, bankers shot back.

<P>
By the end of the week, KPN decided to act decisively to defuse the tension. The 10 banks were told that the structure was being revised. The auction would still take place but the six co-arrangers would not be chosen solely on price. Relationship factors would come into play and additional co-arranger slots might be available if deserved. Perhaps best of all from the banks' point of view, Goldman would no longer be sole arranger. Its position atop the deal would have to be shared with a joint arranger and bookrunner from the 10 commercial banks. 

<P>
Citibank secured the role of co-arranger, presumably by making the lowest bid. ABN Amro was agent. The three-year loan was priced at 10bp over Libor and bankers say that KPN is probably over-paying. They had expected 8bp over Libor. One banker says: "Goldman united the banks instead of pitching them against each other. KPN should easily have got a single-digit margin."&#009;<B>Nigel Pavey</B>

<B>AUSTRALIA</B>
</H4>
<H2>
<B>St George advances</B>
</H2>
<P>
Australia's largest corporate merger, New South Wales-based St George Bank's agreed bid for Advance Bank, may herald a wave of consolidation in Australian banking, drawing in international as well as local participants. 

<P>
The A$2.65 billion ($2.1 billion) deal is the latest and largest in a series of mergers and acquisitions Australian regulators have supported to ensure the big four national banks &#173; National Australia Bank (NAB), Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Westpac and ANZ &#173; face adequate competition in each state. 

<P>
The new St George Bank will be the largest regional bank. It will have a bigger share of deposits in South Australia (25%) than its nearest rival, CBA with 18.3%. In New South Wales, it will rank third with 17%, after Westpac (18.9%) and CBA (18.2%).

<P>
Overall, it will rank as the country's fifth-largest bank, with A$43 billion of assets, compared to ANZ, smallest of the four national banks with A$71 billion. NAB, the largest, has A$92 billion of assets. In certain market segments, St George clearly stands comparison with the national banks. Its A$16.6 billion of mortgage lending, ranks above ANZ with A$14.9 billion. 

<P>
The scale of bank mergers is growing. Last year St George wanted to buy the former state-owned BankSA, but lost out to Advance Bank, which paid A$730 million. With this deal, it neatly swallows up its earlier prey. 

<P>
The combination of the former building societies is a full-blooded in-market merger, predicated on combining the two banks' networks, cutting costs and eliminating jobs. Investment bankers in Australia had been pitching the idea to St George chief executive Jim Sweeney for months but he appeared to resist a deal that may cost 1,000 jobs. The arrival as St George chairman of Frank Conroy, former chief executive of Westpac, pushed the deal forward. 

<P>
The management target for the new bank is to take out A$140 million of the combined costs before tax, with 80% of that to be realized in two years. Much of this will come from closures among the 169 overlapping branches within the combined banks' 607-branch networks. 

<P>
Australian bankers are impatiently awaiting the report of the government-sponsored Wallace commission into the future of the country's financial services. This may bring sweeping recommendations. Meanwhile the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is not shy about its views. Chairman Allan Asher describes the St George/Advance Bank merger as potentially "pro-competitive" and adds that "banks, especially the majors, are shielded from a lot of potential competition because of restrictions in the Bank (shareholding) Act and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act".

<P>
Bankers in Australia interpret such comments as a warning to NAB, which owns 6.8% of St George, not to make a counter bid for Advance Bank. That raises the question of what NAB will do with its stake. 

<P>
Before the ink is dry on this merger, bankers are already thinking of future deals. Other takeover candidates include Bank of Melbourne and Colonial Bank. St George may itself be swallowed up. "It would be a logical fit for an international bank interested in expanding into the Asia Pacific region. It now has the critical mass to be the start of a new Australian national bank," says Alastair Walton, director, financial institutions group, at CS First Boston, which advised St George. Its articles of association will prevent a full acquisition for five years, but a potential buyer could take a strategic stake. 

<P>
European banks might be tempted into Australia as part of a longer-term effort to build up in Asia. It was with this in mind that Bank of Scotland last year acquired 51% of Perth-headquartered BankWest from the government of Western Australia, paying 1.8 times book value. This was the first time an overseas bank has been allowed to acquire an established retail banking franchise in Australia.  

<P>
Australian regional banks have inherent attractions, being generally well run, with strong returns on equity and transparent financial reporting. Now, with the regional sector apparently being transformed by mergers, bankers wonder whether Bank of Scotland will sit on that investment, add to it or even dispose of it. 

<P>
Rumours of foreign potential takeovers are rife. There has been talk of a possible combination between Standard Chartered and ANZ, perhaps through some joint shareholding scheme rather than a full takeover, though a spokesman for Standard Chartered says: "There is nothing in it at the moment, we are totally unaware of anything." 

<P>
High valuations are being applied to regional banks. In mid-1995, Advance paid 1.6 times book value for BankSA. This merger values Advance Bank at 2.1 times book value, the same as Westpac recently paid for Perth-based Challenge Bank. 

<P>
St George applied some thought to bid financing, which mainly takes the form of St George shares. The bank is offering A$2.10 in cash plus A$0.20 from a special dividend, with the rest of the indicated price of A$7.30 per Advance Bank share made up of St George stock. The final price may fluctuate with St George's share price &#173; A$8.69 at the time of the bid. To protect itself from paying too much, St George worked out a pricing mechanism that reduces the number of shares it offers if its own share price rises, so capping the bid price at A$7.30. If its share price falls, it offers more shares up to a specified limit. Advance Bank shareholders only receive less than A$7.30 if the St George share price falls below A$8. This puts a collar on the bid price, making it effectively a fixed-price offer. &#009;<B>Peter Lee</B>

<B>ASSET-BACKED EUROBONDS</B>
</H4>
<H2>
<B>Asset-backed gets up steam</B>
</H2>
<P>
Asset-backed issues finally came of age in the Euromarkets in 1996. Total volume of non-mortgage asset-backed Eurobonds will comfortably top $20 billion in 1996, up from $2.6 billion in 1994 and $3.8 billion in 1995. The UK government can indirectly claim much of the credit.

<P>
When the government privatized British Rail, three companies, known as Roscos, were set up to own, maintain and lease the trains; one, Angel, was bought by the GRS consortium, which includes Babcock &amp; Brown and Nomura. The current leases with train operating companies (TOCs) run for between seven and 10 years from April 1994, and are 80% guaranteed by the government. They are operating leases, split into a maintenance element and a capital element.

<P>
In January, Nomura raised &#163;550 million towards a &#163;700 million total acquisition price by securitizing the government-guaranteed part of the capital element of Angel's leases. 

<P>
Aimed at asset swap investors, the securitization took the apparently unwieldy form of 98 zero-coupon bonds: one for each payment that Angel would receive from the TOCs. This structure took full advantage of the positive yield curve: Guy Hands, head of Nomura's principal finance group, estimates that by hugging the curve so closely Angel saved about five basis points compared with the cost of a quarterly obligation. This, he says, offsets any reduction in liquidity compared with a more conventional securitized floating-rate bond.

<P>
It is difficult to imagine a less liquid structure than this. But banks were attracted by the government-guaranteed bonds because they can take full advantage of the 20% risk weighting. "Banks prefer to do their own internal swaps," says Hands, explaining why Nomura did not swap the bonds into floating-rate notes itself. "They offset the bond swap against the rest of their positions and often come out better off after internal risk accounting."

<P>
This is fine if you're offered zeros and you're a bank. But a less well rated investor unable to do an internal swap would end up having to pay a lot of money for swap counterparty risk. 

<P>
One banker calls it "the stupidest way imaginable: it's almost as though they set out to maximize illiquidity and swap counterparty risk. On top of that, because it was structured as a series of zeros, they had to be completely inflexible in the way they allowed Angel to structure their leases."

<P>
Yet demand was strong. The yield was 15bp over Libor &#173; a big saving on 100bp bank loans. There were few asset-backed benchmarks to compare it with. Even so, bankers asked whether Nomura might not have got a bit closer to the government's own cost of funds &#173; between 15bp and 20bp below Libor.

<P>
Spurred on by its success, Nomura decided to attempt what had been unthinkable a few months earlier: the securitization of the 20% of the leases that did not carry a government guarantee. This involved getting shadow credit ratings for the TOCs. Two of the four bonds, together worth &#163;130 million, had triple-A ratings, and came at less than 20bp over Libor. The other two were of &#163;25 million each. One was triple-B, at about Libor plus 100bp; the final double-B tranche (effectively a first-loss tranche, as it was lower than the shadow credit ratings of the TOCs paying the leases) was 300bp over. In all, they saved Angel an extra &#163;20 million.

<P>
At about the same time as Nomura's second securitization, British bus company Stagecoach won the franchise for South West Trains, the first TOC to be privatized. From its beginnings as a ruthless Perth-based bus company, Stagecoach has in less than a year become a highly successful international passenger transport business with an eye for expansion through cheap acquisitions. Rather than bid ever-higher prices for TOCs, it started looking abroad &#173; and at Roscos.

<P>
It bought Porterbrook, the most aggressive of the Roscos, in August 1996, knowing that Angel's experience showed the securitization could be done.

<P>
Of the &#163;825 million Stagecoach paid for Porterbrook, &#163;520 million came in the form of a bridging loan from Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), to be refunded with a securitization.  Just &#163;77 million was paid in cash; the rest came through a very advantageous rights issue. 

<P>
UBS had long been Stagecoach's stockbroker, and the two had built up a strong relationship since UBS floated the company in 1993. "We used UBS because it was a one-stop shop. It made sense to keep everything in the same house," says Stagecoach's finance director Keith Cochrane. 

<P>
Nomura got a lot of very positive press for its securitization, and had privately hinted that no-one else was capable of doing such a thing. UBS picked up Nomura's gauntlet by saying in Stagecoach's acquisition prospectus that it was "highly confident that it will be able to complete the debt securitization". More accurately, it snatched the deal from Goldman Sachs, which had been mandated by Porterbrook for the securitization before Stagecoach came along.

<P>
UBS's deal, when it came, was impressive. Nomura had spent seven months putting its deal together. UBS did it in less than two. Nomura started with 80% of the receivables; UBS did 100% in one go. It raised &#163;545 million.

<P>
The UBS deal is also a lot more elegant than Nomura's 98 zeros. UBS didn't quite achieve the perfect structure of one floating-rate note for the government-guaranteed 80%. It did it with five of differing maturities. The swap was performed in-house. The maturities range in price from 4bp to 14bp over one-month Libor. There are also two bonds for the other 20% of the receivables: a triple-A tranche at 16bp over and a triple-B tranche at 50bp over. This is a lot better than Angel's funding. 

<P>
But there is still argument over whether Nomura has come out in front of UBS in the securitization wars. Angel certainly paid quite a bit more than Stagecoach for its funds. And UBS's floaters are prettier than Nomura's zeros. But, admits Keith Ballantine, assistant director and part of the securitization team at UBS, "asset-backed spreads have come in a lot over the past 12 months". A series of high-profile issues, such as Morgan Stanley's $4 billion GPA airplane refinancing and the Ffr40 billion Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais deal, have awakened a previously dormant appetite for securitizations. And just before the Stagecoach deal, Nomura brought Annington Homes &#173; another UK government-backed issue &#173; to the market at 6.25bp over, tightening to 3.5bp over in a relatively <BR>
illiquid secondary market.

<P>
Given that the Annington Homes deal had a five-year <BR>
average life, compared with just over four for Stagecoach, it seems Nomura has proved itself once again. (There are quibbles about the effect of paying off three-month Libor as opposed to one-month Libor, and paying monthly rather than quarterly, but not even UBS suggests that Stagecoach got a better deal than Annington Homes.)

<P>
With the experience of the Angel funding under its belt, Nomura felt that it could go out beyond 10 years with Annington and tap fixed-rate demand from UK pension funds. Here, the spread is over gilts, not Libor, and can work out cheaper than seven- or eight-year floating-rate funds.

<P>
The dip in the cost of funds over 10 years "is completely counter-intuitive", says Nomura's Hands. "But a pension fund needs to match its [long-term] liabilities, so from its perspective, short-term assets have greater risk than long-term ones. At the time of Angel, we tapped the banks, because they're deep and liquid. But if I were doing a Rosco deal tomorrow, I would be tempted to issue one long fixed-rate bond and sell to the pension funds and insurance companies."

<B>MTNs</B>
</H4>
<H2>
<B>Citicorp's new constellation</B>
</H2>
<P>
Even the sharpest-eyed MTN dealer might have missed a L20 billion ($13.12 million) one-year zero coupon issue at the end of September. It was unlisted, not syndicated and apparently unremarkable. But dealers will very soon become familiar with the borrower. It will be one of the biggest and best in the market. 

<P>
Centauri Corp has just signed $20 billion worth of debt programmes. It will raise funds in four markets, issuing commercial paper and MTNs in the US and European markets through four programmes, each with a ceiling of $5 billion. 

<P>
Centauri Corp is the latest structured investment company to be designed and managed by a 25-strong team at Citibank Credit Structures (CCS). Since the late 1980s, this team has managed the funding and debt investments of two other specialist companies, Alpha and Beta, often called credit arbitrage vehicles. The companies are designed to maintain triple-A long-term debt ratings from both major agencies and produce returns to equity investors by locking in a credit spread between borrowings and investments in a range of instruments. These are mainly asset-backed debt, and issues of financial institutions, governments and a few corporates. 

<P>
Centauri, like its predecessors, relies for its triple-A rating on its layer of equity, which may rise to $1 billion; on a hedging strategy designed to eliminate interest rate and currency risk, and on deft use of funding markets, committed credit lines and liquidity reserves to minimize refinancing risk. It will borrow short-term and invest in a mix of longer-term debt. That maturity mismatch will contribute a fair portion of earnings.

<P>
The CCS team is regarded as among the best users of the MTN markets, praised for its speed of response and willingness to buy back its own paper. That helps it to achieve aggressive funding of below Limean on the typically short-dated debt that the investment companies issue.

<P>
For Alpha and Beta, average life of assets is between four-and-a-half and five years. Borrowings range from three months to six years with an average life of one-and-a-half years. 

<P>
On the investment side, credit rating guidelines are strict. Fully 70% of Centauri's investments will be rated Aa/AA or higher and at least 50% of its investment portfolio will comprise Aaa/AAA rated debt. Assets are swapped into floating-rate dollars. 

<P>
The sternest challenge for managers of the new fund will be finding investment opportunities. Credit spreads between different rated bonds have narrowed in recent months, making the search for yield more challenging. Fund managers have found good value in securitized debt, particularly credit card receivables. But returns are shrinking. Two or three years ago, spreads on credit card deals were between 40bp and 45bp over the risk-free rate. Now they are less than 20bp. 

<P>
Clever investors revelled in the confusion that followed the unexpected rise in interest rates at the start of 1994. Many investment and commercial bank trading desks mispriced bonds in the months of panic that followed, allowing fund managers to pick up attractive assets. The Beta fund bought large volumes of busted structured notes &#173; typically collared notes issued by banks that had been designed to sell in a falling interest rate market and which now underperformed badly. CCS unwound the interest-rate caps and floors embedded in these notes and found itself holding bonds of well-rated issuers yielding twice what they might pay on plain vanilla debt.

<P>
Now Charles Covell, managing director at CCS, says: "It is hard to see credit spreads getting any tighter from here, but we and the markets have been saying that for two years. We must spend more and more time thinking very hard about how to source pockets of good value." 

<P>
Centauri has been designed to cope with this tougher market. It uses new methods of measuring portfolio configuration risk and allocating capital against risk. For example, Beta uses a weighted average of the credit quality of bonds in its investment portfolio to calculate a leverage ratio. An average quality of AA+ dictates it can borrow no more than 7.5 times its equity capital. But that approach has its limitations.

<P>
Centauri, by improving its portfolio risk measurement, can often leverage more and take larger positions than Alpha or Beta could in the same investments. So, even if credit spreads remain obstinately narrow, it should be able to improve earnings. The trick, according to Covell is that "when we see value, we take it early and we take it in size".

<P>
CCS staff have spent much time with rating agency analysts exploring the effects of portfolio diversification. When fund managers find value in a sector of the capital markets, they can derive an additional benefit by spreading investments over more issues, more names, more industry sectors. By reducing portfolio configuration risk, Centauri can increase its leverage. 

<P>
For Beta leverage is capped at 10 times the capital allocated against an investment. Centauri can sometimes leverage up to 25 times. As Covell stresses, "a portfolio can be 20-times leveraged, but still not be as risky as an eight-times leveraged portfolio of inherently riskier assets".

<P>
Centauri should also benefit from CCS' strong relationships with leading investment banks. Investment banks in the asset-backed new issue business have been grateful for the Alpha and Beta funds. They stood behind the growth of seven- and 10-year floating-rate credit-backed securities last year, allowing issuers to launch deals that were essentially underwritten. CCS has also bought large private placements from issuers at times when these had greater difficulty borrowing in the public debt markets. 

<P>
CCS has a list of 20 investment banks, transacting most of its business with the top half dozen. "We cover these suppliers of assets, almost as one would clients. We make it abundantly clear what we want. We don't leave it to them to guess. We want our phone to ring before anyone else's."

<P>
Equity investors in Centauri are typically financial institutions seeking a floating-rate Libor-based return. Many are themselves funded investors, subscribing largely with borrowed money. They enjoy the benefits of CCS' standing among MTN dealers and its size and muscle with banks' trading and sales desks, but they do not have to consolidate their investments. Citicorp earns fees for managing the investment companies. It is not an investor itself, being fearful that US banking regulators might classify funds as Citicorp balance sheet risk. Most investors are Citicorp clients, some no doubt hoping to learn how to manage similar operations for themselves. <B>&#009;Peter Lee</B>

<H4>
<B>GERMANY</B>
</H4>
<H2>
<B>Votes in custody</B>
</H2>
<P>
At last, there is a real prospect of reform for Germany's ineffectual system of corporate governance. In legal amendments drawn up by a parliamentary committee, the most interesting proposal is to prohibit banks from using their custody clients' voting rights if they already own more than 5% of the company.

<P>
The committee responded to retail investors' disquiet that their shares were being abused to bolster the "power of the banks", a perenially emotive subject. 

<P>
Losing their clients' voting rights would indeed be a blow for powerful corporate shareholders like the big private-sector German banks. They have substantial shareholdings in a number of companies and have traditionally augmented that influence by exercising their clients' voting rights as well. Deutsche Bank's shareholding of at least 5.2% in Bayerische Vereinsbank, for instance, tells only half the story. Add to that a couple of percent worth of voting rights culled from institutional and retail clients, plus several more percent owned by Deutsche Bank group companies such as fund manager DWS and insurer Deutsche Herold. 

<P>
Vereinsbank is conducting a survey of other banks to try to find out the extent of these custody voting rights, but is still waiting for replies. But it seems a fair assumption that Deutsche Bank already controls at least 10%, and perhaps 15%, of its Bavarian competitor. 

<P>
Formally, Deutsche Bank would need far more than that to gain control of Vereinsbank. But corporate shareholders rarely try to use naked voting power to press a point; influence is usually expressed in negotiations with management and at supervisory board meetings. Perceived clout is mostly more decisive than actual voting strength.

<P>
Only the largest institutional investors in Germany bother to attend annual general meetings of DAX companies. Most smaller &#173; and foreign &#173; investors not only entrust their votes to a custodian bank, but let the bank decide how to vote. While some retail investors use shareholder clubs to exercise their votes, institutional investors have no time-saving alternative; most are content to trust their banks. 

<P>
The possible loss of that trust concerns custodians. Deutsche Bank is the largest custodian bank in Germany and has grown to the fourth-largest global custodian in the world over the past couple of years. Peter Grafunder, global head of international custody services, says it is time-consuming and expensive to provide a free voting service for clients, but concedes that the bank must do so before it can offer more lucrative value-added custody. Grafunder admits that if the bank were unable to offer basic voting representation to a client, the entire account might be removed to a rival custodian.

<P>
One solution, Grafunder says, might be to establish independent voting companies. That would enable banks with major corporate shareholdings to shed the responsibility of voting, but preserve their custody business. Banking lawyers believe it would be out of the question for banks to own voting companies, since that would preserve their control over clients' votes. But it is difficult to see who else might offer that service. There appears to be no interest from major institutional investors. Law firms would be unable to market a voting service properly while they are banned from advertising and publicising their activities. 

<P>
Another proposal might be more feasible. The annual convention of German lawyers recently passed a motion that banks should be obliged to disclose any voting rights in excess of 5% which they exercise on behalf of clients. Banks would still have the power, but it would at least be public knowledge.

<P>
Banks now worry that they will lose influence from early 1998, when the amendments are scheduled to become law. They could accelerate the restructuring and mergers that are now regarded as inevitable. One banker attacks the amendment as "a back-door attempt to oblige the banks to reduce their participations". German banks would pay over 60% in capital gains tax if they sold their corporate participations, so banking lawyers suggest it would be anti-constitutional effectively to force them to do so. &#009;<B>Laura Covill</B>

<H3>EDITORIAL</H3>
<H2>Japan back on track </H2>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
After five years of prolonged slump, 1996 may be the year when things in Japan get moving again.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
True, the economy is unlikely to boom. Independent economists think the government's official forecast of 2.5% real GDP growth for financial year 1996/7 is pie in the sky. Most economists would be surprised if growth much exceeded 1%. The real estate market still looks dodgy too. Analysts believe land prices still have a further 20% or 30% to fall - which will delay the recovery of the banking sector. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But Japan's financial markets will at last start to modernize. A senior official at a Japanese securities house comments: "1996 will be a benchmark year for deregulation in the capital markets in Japan." 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The consequences of that deregulation will be that opportunities for foreign borrowers to issue bonds and equities in Japan will further increase and big Japanese institutions will start to buy foreign securities in large sums again. Even the stock market could be on the rise. Some analysts believe the Nikkei index, which was testing 20,000 in December (having risen from below 15,000 in July), could continue to climb as Japanese retail and foreign institutional investors increase their exposure.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What deregulation is likely? The restrictions on which foreign borrowers can issue public bonds in Japan were significantly eased from January 1. Issuers of samurai bonds (or publicly-offered Euroyen bonds) no longer have to have a BBB or better credit rating. This will open the way for lesser-rated sovereigns such as Romania, Bulgaria or eastern European cities to come to the market. Household-name companies (such as the big three US auto-makers, PepsiCo or Daimler-Benz) will also tap the Japanese retail market in greater numbers in 1996. Expect also more Eurobonds from Japanese companies when the 90-day seasoning period for such issues is reduced to 40 days (in line with the US) sometime during this year.  
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Potentially even more significant is a complete overhaul of the Japanese government bond (JGB) market. JGBs have missed out on the modernization that most other government bond markets, particularly in Europe, have implemented during this decade. Settlement is slow, no true repo market exists, one benchmark bond dominates trading (there are dozens of small illiquid off-the-run issues), and the yield curve is patchy - the government does not issue five-year paper, for example. The ministry of finance (MoF) is said to be looking at sweeping reforms. It probably has no choice. Japan's budget deficit will reach 7.7% of GDP next year: it is increasing by more than &#165;20 trillion ($200 billion) annually.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The compartmentalized nature of Japanese finance (with banks, securities houses and trust banks separated) will begin to crumble this year too. A recent proposal to allow the creation of financial holding companies is likely to become law soon. It will allow banks to own securities houses and <I>vice versa</I>. Until now, this has been permitted only in exceptional circumstances. It will also make bank mergers easier. Now, when a major bank takes over a smaller institution, the two have to merge into one entity. The acquirer is forced to raise the salaries of the acquired staff to the level of the bigger bank. In future, the acquired institution can become a subsidiary, retaining its identity - and cost structure.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For these and other reasons, more banks will merge in 1996. The trust banks, particularly Yasuda Trust, look vulnerable. Some have (publicly-admitted) non-performing debt equal to more than 15% of assets. One or two will probably be bought by city banks. The top city banks, Sanwa, Sumitomo and Fuji, will also look for merger partners to compete against the newly-created giant Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi (to give it its clumsy official English name). A shock jumbo merger is not impossible either. The most extreme rumour in Tokyo links Fuji Bank, Yasuda Trust and Long-Term Credit Bank. Smaller securities houses will also be bought up. Below the big four (Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi), few brokers make money. Most are connected to big commercial banks, which will try to take them over once the holding company law is passed.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Longer term, the biggest shift is the coming revolution in the pension fund industry. Japan's large, but backward, life companies and trust banks (which until five years ago had a monopoly of managing pension money) are losing ground to new asset management firms. These now run &#165;4 trillion of Japan's &#165;38 trillion of private-sector pensions.  This year, when the life companies and trust banks lower their guaranteed annual return from 4.5% to 2.5%, money will flood into the asset management companies. The pension fund trustee at one of Japan's big trading companies told <I>Euromoney</I> he now has 10% of his pension fund placed with these firms (up from zero three years ago): he expects the percentage to grow to 40% within a few years. Even the public Pension and Welfare Corporation recently appointed four foreign asset management firms.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Why this is significant is that the asset management companies are much more sophisticated in their investing strategies. The traditional pension fund managers have only about 6% of their assets in foreign bonds (and almost nothing in foreign equities), 60% of their money is tucked away in low-yielding JGBs and as much as 15% is in cash. As pension money shifts towards the more adventurous fund managers, expect to see Japanese capital once again flowing into foreign bond and equity markets. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Finally, don't rule out really radical change in Japan this year. Japan has been a slow-moving society for 50 years. But signs are this is changing. Fundamental values - religion, Japan's role in the world, employment practices - are being challenged. Moving the capital out of Tokyo is being seriously considered, for example. <I>Euromoney</I>'s<I> </I>long-shot prediction for 1996? That the MoF will be split up. Politicians will finally recognize that the ministry was responsible for the economic disaster of the past five years and that it is too powerful and all-encompassing to allow a free-market economy to develop. It will be divided into: the ministry of economics, government budget office, banking supervisory commission, securities and exchange commission, and tax agency - all independent and all based outside Tokyo. <p>

<H3>KERR'S PEOPLE - <I>Ian Kerr</I></H3>
<H2>Hans-Peter Bauer</H2>
<B>head of global fixed income and derivatives, UBS, London</B><BR>
<BR>
What would you expect from someone whose CV includes &quot;studies and final
degree from the humanistic gymnasium in Basel&quot;? A trainee social worker
adept on the high parallel bars, perhaps? You would be wrong. Forget &quot;humanistic&quot;
in its usual meaning of a system or process which puts human interests and
the mind of man before all else. Humanism also applies to literary culture
and, in the case of Hans-Peter Bauer, means the study of classical Latin
and Greek. And what about the gymnasium and images of parallel bars and
triple somersaults on a wooden horse? The reality is less exciting. This
gymnasium simply means a school. <BR>
<BR>
But there is little else which has been simple about the career of Hans-Peter
Bauer, who recently arrived from Zurich to become one of the overlords of
the burgeoning fixed-income, sales, trading and derivatives business of
UBS in London. While he would be loath to refer to himself as a rocket scientist
or a quant, he has all of the personal attributes and qualifications. Progressing
from classics in Basel, Bauer read mathematics at university in Zurich and
then took a PhD in mathematics and a thesis in algebraic topology at the
Federal High School of Technology (FHTZ). <BR>
<BR>
On his arrival at UBS in 1984, such quantitative skills were ideally suited
to the new booming market in swaps and the development of new products in
the capital markets area. Five years later Bauer, still only 36, became
head of all swaps and new capital markets products in Zurich. The UBS top
management quickly added derivatives to his portfolio and by 1992 he was
appointed the bank's head of derivatives worldwide. <BR>
<BR>
Why did he move to London? Did the London office need him to bolster its
fixed-income business which in 1994-95 had started to lag seriously behind
arch-rivals CS First Boston and Swiss Bank Corporation which had just acquired
SG Warburg? In fact Bauer took the initiative to move to London himself
and the decision was not part of a rescue or supporting operation. &quot;The
Zurich base was already established, efficient and profitable with around
100 employees. However, to grow the business, London, with 500 sales and
trading staff and its time-zone advantages, was the natural centre,&quot;
comments Bauer. <BR>
<BR>
Nor is the UBS London office any more a lame duck after substantial reorganization
under former chairman Rudi Mueller and present CEO David Robins. Bauer sees
greater immediate profit potential in New York, where UBS has recently been
embarking on a major hiring spree, and Tokyo. <BR>
<BR>
While the east Asian operations, centred on Hong Kong and Singapore, have
been very successful, results from Tokyo have been consistently disappointing.
<BR>
<BR>
Bauer has a formidable arsenal at his disposal, not least the worldwide
UBS office network, its legendary private-client base and the bank's rock-solid,
triple-A credit rating. The credit rating is especially valuable in the
derivatives sector where UBS is one of the most prized counterparties in
any transaction. The focus of Bauer's attention may now be leveraging that
credit standing for securitization, credit enhancement and also repackaging
products. <BR>
<BR>
Bauer and his wife Marcella are expecting their third child. Apart from
skiing, his main interest outside UBS is the study of Islamic history and
culture (he is fluent in Arabic). However, if that gets boring, he also
speaks German, English, French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. Contrary
to UBS tradition, Bauer is not an officer in the Swiss army but then neither
is Mathis Cabiallavetta, the new chief executive or Werner Bonadurer, head
of sales and risk management, to whom Bauer reports in Zurich. Times are
changing - even at UBS . <BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H2>Tinny Hasendonckx </H2>
<B>head of Euromarket trading - Kredietbank Brussels </B><BR>
<BR>
Speaking of Tinny Hasendonckx's probable election of the board of the International
Securities Market Association (Isma), Charles Treuhold, a former partner
at Arnhold &amp; Bleichroeder in New York says: &quot;In the early days
it would have been rather like Mrs Pankhurst trying to join the Hellfire
Club&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Tinny Hasendonckx's knowledge of Sir Francis Dashwood's licentious 18th-century
gatherings at Medmenham Abbey in Buckinghamshire thankfully may be vague,
but as head of Euromarket trading at Kredietbank, she is set to break down
the barrier of a 28-year-old club this May. At Isma's 1996 AGM to be held
in Cannes, she is one of five candidates standing for election to the main
board. If successful, she will be the first female board member in its history.
<BR>
<BR>
For the self-assured Hasendonckx, joining the Isma board, doesn't represent
anything more than a natural, although long overdue, progression in the
capital markets industry. Nor does the extra attention she will receive
if she's elected to the board especially concern her. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Women have been both extremely active and effective on the Isma regional
and sub-committees for years,&quot; she says. &quot;Look at the contribution
made by Milvia Groff of Banca Euromobiliare, whose work is recognized by
everyone.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Once on the Isma board - election is virtually guaranteed for all candidates
and Hansendonckx will carry the full support and votes of the powerful Low
Countries region - she will immediately feel at home. The original Association
of International Bond Dealers (AIBD, now Isma) was founded in 1968 by an
influential but opportunistic group of bond traders to protect their own
interests. Some 28 years later the trading influence is still strong. Current
chief executive John Langton was once head of trading at Orion Bank. Deputy
chairman William Watt made his name as a floating-rate note trader with
Citicorp and Kidder Peabody. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Progress by performance</B> <BR>
<BR>
As head of Euromarket trading at Kredietbank's HQ in Brussels, Hasendonckx
won't be intimidated by her new (all male) Isma colleagues. Now 35, she
has been with Kredietbank for the whole of her working career since she
won a scholarship from the bank to study oriental languages in Japan. She
claims her once-fluent written and conversational Japanese is now rusty,
but she speaks Dutch, English, French and German. <BR>
<BR>
Returning from Asia in 1987 she was told that there were vacancies on the
trading desk. She didn't hesitate. &quot;Prospects of advancement in the
traditional commercial and lending areas of the bank were gradual but in
the trading room progress was measured by performance,&quot; she says. The
only alternative career she considered was to stay in east Asia with one
of the multinational industrial corporations, and she briefly contemplated
joining Honda. <BR>
<BR>
The Isma connection began two years ago with election to the Belgian regional
committee where Kredietbank, Generale and BBL are the most powerful representative
banks. When it came to the nomination for the main Isma board Hasendonckx
was proposed to the regional members by Ludwig Coppens, manager of fixed-income
operations at Generale Bank, where she was also supported by veteran Euromarket
trader, Roland Organe. Coppens comments: &quot;The fact that she might be
the first lady member of the Isma board didn't really concern the selection
process, she was simply the best person and the best candidate to represent
the interests of our members.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
If the current Isma board is expecting the arrival of a softie they are
likely to be disappointed. Away from the office, Hasendonckx finds time
for sheer-face rock climbing, mountaineering and long-distance cycling.
On a board which makes little secret of its weakness for long and lavish
dinners, she may encourage a new Spartan health regime. <BR>
<BR>
On a recent trip to Morocco with some friends she covered 2,500 kilometres
by bicycle and also climbed the 4,000 metre high Mount Toubkal. Does such
an accomplished woman have any weaknesses? &quot;I'm not sure whether she
can cook,&quot; says Coppens. <BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H2>Thomas Keller </H2>
<B>head of asset/liability management - L-Bank, Germany </B><BR>
<BR>
Karlsruhe, the capital of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg in Germany doesn't quite
have the same tourist pull as the fleshpots of Berlin or the fast-vanishing
decadence of Hamburg. But Karlsruhe's answer to &quot;The Magic Kingdom&quot;
is the Schloss, built by the Duke of Baden in 1715. Some say the duke fell
asleep under a tree and was told in a dream that he should build a castle
where he lay. Others say he was simply taking a well-earned rest after running
away from his wife. Today there is a regular flow of lawyers to Karlsruhe
who come to the constitutional court. Middle-aged visitors, remembering
a different era, come to take photographs of the special air-raid-proof
courts built for the trial of the Bader-Meinhof terrorists. Visiting bankers
from abroad, however, inevitably make a beeline for <BR>
Karlsruhe's largest financial institution, Landeskreditbank Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg,
which is known everywhere as L-Bank. <BR>
<BR>
Seven years ago L-Bank was virtually unknown outside Germany. Owned by the
state of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg, it had little reason to look beyond the
national borders. Cash-rich and ultra-conservative, the bank found that
its infrequent calls for funding were easily satisfied by the domestic markets.
During the late 1980s the bank's first external borrowings in yen and Swiss
franc private placements gave little indication that it would become one
of the more professional and innovative Euromarket issuers. &quot;I don't
think that the yen and Swiss franc liabilities were even hedged,&quot; recalls
former head of funding John Howell. Howell succeeded Bert de Kock (now with
BNG in Holland) and his colleague Gertraud Foos Ollson, who initially widened
the horizon of L-Bank's external funding and established the name as an
important new triple-A rated borrower. <BR>
<BR>
The capital markets group at the bank includes vice-chairman Christian Brand,
head of funding Stephen Tribull (who succeeded Howell) with his colleague
Helmut Sternman, and the head of asset/liability management, the 30-year
old Thomas Keller. Howell continues as outside adviser. Keller controls
all of the bank's asset/liability activities, derivatives, including all
futures, swaps and swaptions, and the domestic Bund trading operations.
He has been responsible for changing the asset/liability management strategy
from micro-hedging to a more global view of risk management. The new macro-hedging
philosophy provides greater transaction flexibility and a clearer view of
the bank's overall risk positions. The goal of Keller's revised risk management
strategy is to have detailed information and knowledge of L-Bank's cash
flows available at all times. A reporting system has now been developed
which enables senior management to have daily updates on all of the bank's
trading and other risk liabilities. To put icing on the cake, Keller's group
has become an important profit centre for the bank by expanding margins
between asset income and liability expense. <BR>
<BR>
Although Tribull is the popular public figure behind L-Bank's funding requirements
in the international capital markets, he and Keller work closely together.
Keller will specify the forthcoming funding requirements and the target
price expressed in net sub-Libor cost of funds to the bank. Tribull and
Sternman are the accomplished deal arrangers who will invite bids and are
in regular contact with the syndicate desks of the main international investment
banks. <BR>
<BR>
With outstanding debt now denominated in 14 currencies, L-Bank has come
a long way from the early unhedged private placements. Keller and Tribull
are opportunistic borrowers receptive to competitive offers in any recognized
currencies. Even if there is no immediate financing requirement, attractively
priced deals will be completed and then parked by Keller until the funds
need to be drawn down. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Loan engineering</B> <BR>
<BR>
In the close-knit community of top derivatives specialists, Keller's reputation
is spreading. Through the bank he is a major derivatives customer with volume
rumoured to be around Dm50 billion a year. While that makes him a major
player, he has also refined and improved a number of derivative products
and has published several studies on exotic swaps and swaptions. His most
recent eye-catching work introduced &quot;loanly options&quot;. Through
the introduction of loanly options Keller has redefined L-Bank's approach
to making loan commitments to customers. Typically, a customer in Germany
will receive a firm loan commitment from the bank at a fixed price. However,
the customer does not have to commit himself to the loan for a period that
may last up to six weeks providing him, in effect, with a free option. The
underlying risk to the bank is the price risk of the bank's refinancing
if interest rates move against it. By developing a hedge through a complex
pricing formula the loanly options have been imbedded in the firm's loan
commitments and remove or reduce the bank's risk. <BR>
<BR>
Banking won out over Keller's other career option - joining the family business
which operates Ford Motor sales franchises. His preferred taste in cars
is Formula One and before the next challenge to loanly options he is trying
to find time to finish his doctoral thesis. Not surprisingly, the thesis
includes the study of option-pricing formulae. p>

<H3>TELECOMS</H3> 
<H2>Banks ring up telephone number deals </H2>
<H4>Telecoms deregulation has hit the land-of-the-free local call. Danielle
Robinson reports on the rich pickings for bankers from the freeing-up of
US telephone and broadcasting services as the players fight for a share
of integrated markets </H4>
The US congress has rarely made Wall Street investment bankers as happy
as it did when it passed the telecommunications bill on February 8. A competitive
free-for-all in long-distance and local telephone services, as well as in
the cable, broadcast and radio industries, has been unleashed by the legislation.
That means a lip-smacking fee bonanza for investment bankers. <BR>
<BR>
Until this liberalization, the seven Baby Bell local telephone companies,
created after AT&amp;T's break-up in 1984, were excluded from the $60 billion-plus
long-distance market and from local markets outside their designated regions.
Conversely, long-distance service providers such as AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint
were barred from the $100 billion local phone market and had to pay the
Bells access fees to offer their customers long-distance services. <BR>
<BR>
Now the barriers are down and no telecoms market is off limits to any company.
Bells can offer long-distance services outside their home regions immediately
on cellular networks and by purchasing them at a discount from long-distance
providers and onselling them with a mark-up to their customers. They will
also be able to offer long-distance calls on networks within their own regions
once they have satisfied the authorities that these have been opened to
competition. <BR>
<BR>
Long-distance companies can provide local telephone services, either by
buying from existing providers at a discount and onselling, by developing
their own wire lines or by using wireless systems such as cellular-phone
networks. <BR>
<BR>
Once technology glitches have been ironed out, cable companies and electricity
and gas utilities will also be able to carry local and long-distance telephone
services. Long-distance and local phone companies and cable operators will
be able merge in certain cases, forge alliances or take strategic investments
in one another to offer every form of communication, information and entertainment
that can be beamed or wired into homes and offices. The legislation also
substantially lifts restrictions on broadcast TV and radio ownership. <BR>
<BR>
As a result, billions of dollars worth of M&amp;A, advisory business and
underwriting has been announced or is in the pipeline. It includes joint
ventures for long-distance operations between Bell giants Nynex and Bell
Atlantic, and a $10.8 billion acquisition in cash, stock and accumulated
debt of Continental Cablevision by US West Media Group. Broker's analysts
have even suggested that MCI will eventually be taken over by a Bell. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There is a belief among industry players that they have to have an
integrated strategy, offering a bundle of telecoms, information and entertainment
products delivered through wireless and wire-line transport mechanisms to
be a major player in the future,&quot; says Michael Price, managing director
and head of telecoms investment banking at Lazard Fr&egrave;res. &quot;If
you subscribe to that view, the question then is: in offering these packages
to consumers and businesses, do you need to acquire, partner or rent to
get there? And in what combination?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The expectation is that ultimately all US domestic and global communication
wireless and wire-line networks transmitting voice, data and video products
will be controlled by a handful of mega-communication/entertainment conglomerates.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What you are seeing in the US is an attempt by the Bells and the long-distance
phone companies to build a nationwide system; to create a brand name under
which they will try to sell a bundle of local, long-distance, cellular,
cable-TV and internet services all on the one bill to homes and businesses,&quot;
says Mark Maybell, co-head of telecoms, media and technology investment
banking at Merrill Lynch in New York. Adds Price: &quot;Ten years from now
in the US, we will have five or six major integrated companies that will
have local, long-distance, wireless and broad-band products.&quot; These
will be built around names like Bell Atlantic/Nynex, AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint.
<BR>
<BR>
These giants will also attract partners in peripheral sectors, such as software
developers, satellite-broadcast providers, and internet access and on-line
service companies. Microsoft, for example, has aligned itself with MCI,
which in turn has taken a strategic investment in News Corporation and entered
a joint venture with that company to develop a satellite television and
communications system in the US similar to the UK's BSkyB. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Buying in expertise</B> <BR>
<BR>
Control of access to the internet is also up for grabs. In February AT&amp;T
signalled its intention to seek a dominant position in consumer internet
access by giving its long-distance customers five hours of fee-free access
each month and 1-800 (freephone) dial-up at all times. Any internet access
providers that are able to survive such an onslaught will probably be acquired
by telecom giants. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It wouldn't surprise me if the Bells were to pick up some major internet
access providers or some smaller companies,&quot; says an internet company
analyst. &quot;They'll just buy the expertise and forget about developing
it. I'd say that within two years, internet access as we now know it won't
exist. It will come with call forwarding, call waiting, voice mail or other
conventional services. Internet access will be just another option in standard
household services.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The fear of being crushed by the biggest players has already spurred acquisition
activity. US West Media Group (the cable arm of the Baby Bell US West) acquired
Boston-based Continental Cablevision for $5.3 billion in cash and stock
and the assumption of $5.5 billion in debt in what is so far the biggest
M&amp;A announcement since the Telecommunications Act 1996 became law. <BR>
<BR>
The deal creates the third-largest cable company in the US and gives US
West the ability to encroach on the territory of its fellow Bells by using
the cable distribution network in other regions for telephone services.
For Continental, however, the move was a do-or-die effort: &quot;It's going
to be a waltz of elephants, and you want to be sure you don't get stepped
on,&quot; says its chairman, Amos Hostetter. <BR>
<BR>
The trend is global. &quot;I think you will see four or five global carrier
networks emerging out of all of this international deregulation of the telecommunications
industries,&quot; says Ian Clark, managing director of telecom and media
investment banking at JP Morgan in London. <BR>
<BR>
Already the biggest telecom companies have banded together. Unisource, a
consortium of Dutch, Spanish, Swedish, and Swiss telecoms companies, has
affiliated with AT&amp;T World Partners, which is AT&amp;T's global carrier.
MCI and British Telecom announced a strategic alliance, called Concert,
several years ago and Sprint is affiliated with France T&eacute;l&eacute;com
and Deutsche Telekom in a venture called GlobalOne. &quot;These sorts of
groups will ultimately dominate the end-to-end global communications business,&quot;
says Clark. &quot;That doesn't mean the local carriers will disappear, but
it does mean that they will be affiliated in some way with these global
carrier groups. As you get competition in the local markets you will see
tighter affiliations.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This US and international consolidation provides Wall Street with two huge
revenue components: domestic and cross-border M&amp;A and advisory work,
and the financing of the tens of billions of dollars to upgrade and extend
distribution networks. Asset sales by combined entities will also be a major
source of revenue for the banks. <BR>
<BR>
Currently the US market is in a frenzy of alliance and merger activity as
would-be major brand names look to secure comprehensive wireless and wire-line
networks and the associated voice, data and video telecom, information and
entertainment products that are transmitted along them. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are many pieces of the puzzle,&quot; explains Maybell. &quot;You
are seeing companies like AT&amp;T, Sprint and US West moving quickly to
secure the local and long-distance pieces, as well as the the cable, satellite
and PCSs [personal communication service licences for cellular services].&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The objective is to put together a larger &quot;footprint&quot; of consumer
reach across the nation and then to provide the customers within that footprint
with a bundled package of products. Much of the investment banking advice
devoted to telecommunications currently centres on analyses of the different
opportunities to expand footprint and provide a bundled package of products
and how best the strategy might be executed. &quot;You buy that which is
strategically critical to control, which is customer ownership,&quot; says
Price. &quot;You partner or establish strategic investments for that which
is probably too expensive to buy and you rent things like software and programming.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Some of the combinations under consideration border on the bizarre. Long-time
foes AT&amp;T and MCI, for example, are talking about joining forces against
the Bells by sharing the cost of building local telephone wire-lines. Bankers
say the talks are as much as anything a scare tactic on the part of AT&amp;T
as it files applications to provide local services in all 50 states and
begins negotiations with Bells to buy discounted local phone capacity to
on-sell. <BR>
<BR>
Other alliances under consideration are potentially huge. Two Bells, Bell
Atlantic and Nynex, are negotiating a joint venture to enter the long-distance
business and possibly execute what would be the biggest merger in history,
creating a $50 billion giant dominating more than a third of the long-distance
traffic in its combined regions. <BR>
<BR>
To ensure it has all distribution bases covered, AT&amp;T has announced
a $137.5 million strategic investment in US digital satellite service DirecTV.
Cable companies TCI, Comcast, Cox and Continental are all investors in Primestar,
a competitor to DirecTV. Recently, TCI has held talks with the Direct Broadcast
Satellite (DBS) venture between MCI and News Corp, which plans to launch
its own direct-broadcast satellite service in the US. <BR>
<BR>
Many smaller deals in the telecom and media industry are being forged. Among
them are Dallas-based Chancellor Broadcasting Co's $395 million purchase
of 19 radio stations from Shamrock Broadcasting Inc and the $770 million
buy-out of media company Citicasters Inc in Cincinnati by Jacor Communications,
another Cincinatti-based company. <BR>
<BR>
Wall Street firms reaping the rewards include Salomon Brothers, Goldman
Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and
Lazard Fr&egrave;res. They have distinct approaches to this business and
can boast various client-winning attributes. Salomon is a formidable competitor
in the domestic telecoms M&amp;A sector and is ranked the domestic leader
by Securities Data Corp. <BR>
<BR>
Goldman Sachs is often considered the largest international player. Merrill
Lynch, apart from having one of the biggest global investment banking teams
dedicated to telecommunications, media and technology, is also clearly an
underwriting giant and the firm which has managed more international telecoms
equity mandates than any other house. Morgan Stanley also has a very strong
reputation in the telecoms industry for its M&amp;A and financial advisory
services and is co-lead with Goldman Sachs in the $3 billion initial public
offering of AT&amp;T's technology arm Lucent Technologies this month. <BR>
<BR>
Lucent is being spun off to reduce conflicts of interest it foresees arising
in the provision of new and old AT&amp;T rivals with telecoms equipment.
That deal alone will generate more than $150 million in fees for syndicate
members. <BR>
<BR>
Lehman has a strong client list, including a co-financing advisory role
with Merrill Lynch for Sprint Spectrum, the wireless joint venture between
Sprint and cable companies TCI, Comcast and Cox. Originally Sprint Spectrum
was to have developed the four partners' wireless network as well as a local
telephone system nationwide so that Sprint could provide the ultimate package
of local and long-distance wireless, wire-line video and data products under
its brand name. The financial and managerial complexities of such a deal,
and the wider range of deal opportunities now open to all four partners,
forced Sprint to alter its plans in February. <BR>
<BR>
Although the joint venture's notion of providing every service under the
Sprint name is still intact, Sprint Spectrum will now only develop a wireless
network. Rather than forging one agreement to upgrade cable lines for telephony
with each of the three cable partners, Sprint will now come to three individual
agreements with them. <BR>
<BR>
Lazard Fr&egrave;res has also become a major telecoms and media M&amp;A
house, having quietly amassed an impressive client list. This included MCI,
which it advised on its strategic investment in News Corp to provide information
and entertainment services to business and consumers. The new venture will
use MCI's newly won DBS spectrum, which MCI bought for $682 million. Lazard
also advised Continental on its merger with US West. US West was advised
by Lehman. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fee bonanza</B> <BR>
<BR>
The advisory business in telecoms and media has been hot for several years
in anticipation of liberalization. Deals announced in the past two years
include Walt Disney's $19 billion acquisition of Capital Cities/AB (approved
just a day after the telecommunications legislation was signed), Time Warner's
$7.5 billion acquisition of Turner Broadcasting System and Westinghouse
Electric's $5.4 billion purchase of CBS. <BR>
<BR>
Investment bankers expect the next five years and beyond to be even more
lucrative. &quot;With the advent of this bill we think 1996 and 1997 are
really going to take off,&quot; says Maybell. <BR>
<BR>
Any one of the biggest billion dollar plus M&amp;A deals might generate
a $25 million to $30 million fee to an investment bank. <BR>
<BR>
Total telecom equity proceeds in 1995 were $13.8 billion. Although it varies
from deal to deal, the rule of thumb is an average gross spread of 3% for
deals above $1 billion, an average gross spread of 5% to 6% for deals in
the $150 million to $1 billion range and an average gross spread of 7% for
an initial public offering or deals under $150 million in size. <BR>
<BR>
Eduardo Mestre, head of investment banking at Salomon Brothers, says telecoms,
media and technology should provide at least 20% of investment banking revenues
for the firm into the next century. <BR>
<BR>
At Merrill Lynch the telecoms, media and technology investment banking group
accounts for more than 20% of the firm's foreseeable investment-banking
revenues. It has 85 bankers worldwide and expects to have a 100-strong group
by the year-end. <BR>
<BR>
Last year telecoms, media and technology generated $250 million in financing
and investment banking revenues for Merrill Lynch. And Merrill generated
more than $30 million of investment banking revenue in the media industry
alone in the first five weeks of this year. <BR>
<BR>
Jeff Williams, Morgan Stanley managing director and head of global telecom
investment banking, says he is always on the look-out for investment bankers
to expand his 40-strong global telecommunications team. &quot;There are
just not enough qualified people to fill demand. Every year has been up
in terms of deal volumes and financing volume, so it's been a good growth
business for us.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Maybell's team at Merrill follows about 175 telecoms companies globally
and more than 300 technology companies and several hundred media companies
as potential acquirers, M&amp;A targets, recipients of financial advice
and firms eventually needing to come to the capital markets for funds. Maybell
calculates that about 65 telecoms companies globally are potential equity
issuers of a total of $87 billion over the next three years. In the same
period it is estimated that 35 to 50 telecoms firms will be potential issuers
of high-yield debt in deal sizes greater than $200 million. High-yield fees
per deal are in excess of 3%. <BR>
<BR>
Each alliance carries with it a wide variety of financing needs, as the
Sprint Spectrum deal demonstrates. Sprint and its partners purchased PCS
licences covering a population of 180 million to build a national wireless
network. &quot;We are now in the process of building the network, which
in round numbers is a construction project that will cost in excess of $5
billion over the next three to five years,&quot; says Robert Neumeister,
chief financial officer of Sprint Spectrum. The four partners committed
$4.2 billion of equity into Sprint Spectrum and now it is in the process
of organizing about $2 billion to $3 billion of vendor financing to support
the build-out phase over the next few years. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are looking at all of the capital markets, but the critical initial
start-up phase is being financed by raising funds from our vendors,&quot;
says Neumeister. Vendors' capacity to supply financing for constructing
networks is taken into account when they bid for the supply contracts. Sprint
Spectrum vendors Lucent Technologies and Northern Telecom will raise funds
from the loan and capital markets and provide Sprint Spectrum debt similar
to a loan. Telecoms companies prefer vendor financing over bank loans for
the initial phases of construction because lenders are intimately involved
in developments and are more sympathetic to the many complexities of the
process. <BR>
<BR>
Vendor financing is also a much cheaper form of borrowing than the high-yield
market. &quot;We expect vendor financing to be somewhat cheaper than the
high-yield market would be for us right now, which would be an all-in cost
of somewhere in the range of 10%,&quot; says Neumeister. Vendor financing
will finance a substantial portion of capital expenditure over the next
five years and will be drawn upon in that period as needed. <BR>
<BR>
Neumeister is also trying to secure bank lines of credit. A mixture of about
$2 billion of bank lines of credit and high-yield debt will be sought to
finance Sprint Spectrum's start-up expense, a sizeable portion of which
will be for an intense marketing phase. Much further down the track the
company may consider a public offering to realize some of the value of its
investment, but an equity issue is not in its plans at the moment. <BR>
<BR>
Wall Street bankers will do favours for the major players in the hope of
snaring much more lucrative mandates in the future. &quot;The way to work
this business is to try to service an appropriate number of clients so as
to be involved in what they are doing strategically,&quot; says a banker.
&quot;Frankly in the best situation we rarely do business on a fee scale.
It's all negotiated because, in the best relationship, you do some work
for free in anticipation of getting an adequate share of other business
to make it worthwhile.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
To the delight of bankers, telecoms firms need very little arm-twisting
to see the benefits of aggressively pursuing growth, whether it be from
scratch or through M&amp;A or alliances. Studies of the market show that
the more products a company bundles together on one bill, the less a consumer
is likely to flit from one carrier to another. <BR>
<BR>
Bundling products cannot be done without alliances or acquisitions. &quot;Each
Bell has a different viewpoint on what they have to do to get into the long-distance
market,&quot; says Gordon Rich, managing director and head of telecoms investment
banking at CS First Boston. &quot;There's no unanimous view but alliances
in one way or another will have to be formed.&quot; Also, both the local
and the long-distance companies have no choice but to develop multiple revenue
streams to compensate for loss of market share as competition increases.
<BR>
<BR>
Although telecoms sector players don't dispute the need to grow, it is debatable
whether outright acquisitions will be the dominant strategy. There are managerial,
dividend and cultural problems peculiar to the industry that could complicate
and possibly deter many from seeking mergers. Many of the Bells, for example,
need to determine how best to transform themselves from yield stocks paying
high dividends to aggressive, highly leveraged growth stocks paying relatively
low dividends without causing a plunge in their share values. &quot;Some
Bells have huge payouts in dividends,&quot; says Stephanie Comfort, telecom
equity analyst at Morgan Stanley. &quot;Measured as a percentage of their
cash, Pacific Telesis's dividend payout is more than the cash it generates.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Bells' problems are exacerbated by the fact that in some cases more than
half their stock is held by retail investors wanting a yield stock rather
than by institutions and mutual funds. &quot;Many of these people are either
retired or relying heavily on the dividend income that they get from their
phone stocks,&quot; says Williams. &quot;It's logical to assume that the
prices of these stocks are supported by people buying the stock to get the
dividend and if you cut your dividend your stock price is likely to reflect
that.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Mergers and acquisitions</B> <BR>
<BR>
The maintenance of a good stock price is crucial if the Bells are to expand.
&quot;People that have a highly valued equity will have a distinct competitive
advantage,&quot; says Price. &quot;A strong stock price is critical because
you need to use it as acquisition currency.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The Bells have other distinct problems that lessen acquisition opportunities.
&quot;The free cashflow of the Bells after dividends and capital expenditures
is small relative to the apparent might of their market capitalizations,&quot;
says Price. &quot;Further, given their historical desire to have strong
credit ratings their willingness to take on significant leverage is limited.
Those that prosper will figure out how to deal with the dividend, likely
through some restructuring such as US West has done.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
About six months ago US West dealt with the dividend problem by splitting
itself up into two publicly listed companies - US West Media Group, the
no-dividend, agressive-growth stock and US West Communications, the dividend-paying
local-telephone yield stock. &quot;US West never could have contemplated
the Continental deal without the availability of a targeted stock [US West
Media Group],&quot; says Price. <BR>
<BR>
Another impediment to mergers is the fact that the Bells have been independent
for only a short time and have young chairmen unlikely to want to give up
control. Morgan Stanley's Williams says the bank merger between Chemical/Manufacturers
Hanover is an example of a way of getting around the problem. In that merger
the chairman of Chemical stepped back, even though Chemical was clearly
the surviving group, and became chief operating officer of the merged company.
The head of Manny Hanny became chairman and chief executive officer but
agreed that two to three years later he would retire and hand over the reins
to the Chemical chairman. <BR>
<BR>
There are also cultural problems that could hamper some mergers. Take for
instance a Bell buying MCI, which some analysts consider a possibility.
Bells have been luxuriating in a competition-free environment since their
inception and are often accused of having a bureaucratic, public utility
style of management. MCI, meanwhile, is reckoned to be one of the US's most
aggressive entrepreneurial firms and is now the biggest threat to AT&amp;T
after having clawed its way back from near death in its early years. <BR>
<BR>
Telecoms analysts such as Salomon's Jack Grubman argue that the complexities
of some mergers could result in such lengthy approval procedures by the
authorities that they would not be worth the time and effort. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;A merger of the magnitude of Bell Atlantic and Nynex would take a
minimum of two years to be approved,&quot; he says. &quot;We frankly believe
more shareholder value could be created at Nynex from simply continuing
its impressive rate of change versus distracting management time on a very
lengthy merger process.&quot; <p>

<H3>FINANCIAL LAWYER </H3>
<H2>All mapped out</H2>
<H4>
One financial lawyer is crusading to change the face of international banking
law - by colour coding it. By Christopher Stoakes </H4>
Philip Wood, head of banking at UK law firm Allen &amp; Overy, has just
mapped the world's jurisdictions to determine which are creditor-friendly
(i.e. bank-friendly) and which favour the debtor (borrower). Far from revealing
one homogeneous mass, the maps highlight the fundamental differences of
approach - which can have a direct impact on where and how banks do business
- of the world's jurisdictions. <BR>
<BR>
This in itself is not new to lawyers like Wood who is regarded as the doyen
of international financial lawyers - he wrote the first book on the subject
in 1980 and chaired <I>Euromoney'</I>s first international financial law
conference a decade ago. But by illustrating these differences on a series
of maps, Wood has produced a manual which a dealer on a trading floor can
use. The maps are colour coded to reflect each country's approach to legal
issues such as bankruptcy, security, set-off and trusts. As Wood says: &quot;A
trader doesn't have time to read a massive legal opinion. What he wants
to know is whether, given the law of the counterparty's country, he should
do the deal or not.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We have been instructed by global financial institutions taking collateral
over investment securities in over 40 jurisdictions,&quot; says Wood. &quot;Just
think of the cost if each local law firm charges &#163;10,000 ($15,300)
to reply to a thirty-page questionnaire. That's almost half-a-million quid.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Banks have in the past banded together to share the cost of legal R&amp;D,
either informally or through associations such as ISDA and IFEMA, but these
attempts have been either piecemeal or have taken too long. <BR>
<BR>
<B>W</B>ood's maps reveal at a glance which countries are likely to be problematic
and best avoided. &quot;Take netting,&quot; says Wood. &quot;It's a small,
obscure and arcane field but get it wrong and instead of a netted position
of zero, you've got a massive gross exposure. That's a legal risk which
is unacceptable. Take security for a project financing. If the project is
in Chile or Thailand, or even Greece, the security is much less than that
in Indonesia or Malaysia - which affects a project's bankability.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Like all the best inventions, Wood's seems obvious in retrospect. &quot;That's
the way we make advances,&quot; he says. &quot;Costly efforts which produce
simple truths on which everyone can build.&quot; The idea occurred to him
while he was updating his book - now a six-tome library entitled <I>Law
and Practice of International Finance</I>. As he likes to put it: &quot;The
keys to the cupboard of international financial law are very simple and
reveal a set of old bones you can understand.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>T</B>he principal key is insolvency law. Why? Because insolvency law
involves making a difficult choice between favouring the individual creditor
or maximizing the debtor's estate for the benefit of all creditors. There
are other keys, such as how much security a bank can take, whether netting
(offsetting payments which cancel each other out) is allowed, whether directors
can be liable on a corporate insolvency, whether insolvency can be retroactive
by overturning preferences (payments made to certain but not all creditors
prior to insolvency) and whether title finance (asset finance) arrangements
can be broken. <BR>
<BR>
These keys serve as a surprisingly ac-curate litmus test of where a jurisdiction
stands on creditors' rights. Put all of these together and jurisdictions
can be scored and grouped according to their prevailing attitudes. Some
groupings are obvious: for example, England and Australia. Others such as
Denmark and Turkey, or Japan, Swaziland and Liechtenstein are less obvious.
Most significantly, France and England are diametrically opposed. These
two countries have exported their legal systems to more countries - 80 each
- than any others; followed by Germany which has influenced vast swathes
of Asia including Japan, Korea and China. <BR>
<BR>
Thirty per cent of the world by population consists of emerging markets
which are only now making up their minds - partly because communism destroyed
their traditional legal systems. Instead of selecting the best of existing
systems, they are adopting a single model wholesale. For example, the United
Arab Emirates and Kuwait have just imported France's legal system and the
Dutch have just exported their legal system to Russia. &quot;These competing
jurisdictions represent immensely powerful traditions,&quot; says Wood,
&quot;which makes all talk of harmonization in Europe so much hot air unless
it deals with the basics - which it should.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The maps explode the myth that a jurisdiction's status - as civil (code-based,
usually deriving from Roman law) or common law (no code but a succession
of cases and statutes refining previous interpretations) - is relevant.
Wood regards the common-law trust concept as crucial since it separates
actual from legal ownership. &quot;If a securities custodian goes bust,
the securities it holds should not be treated as its property, but in many
countries that is the case. In Belgium, they had to push through legislation
recognizing the trust for securities, which is what Euroclear is,&quot;
he says. Japan's group is unusual in having the Roman tradition (via Germany)
but containing the trust concept - in Japan's case, imposed by the Americans
after the war. The obstacle to the trust concept is the historic fear of
&quot;secret ownership&quot; - a creditor dealing with the debtor on the
basis of the debtor's apparent assets, only to discover that those assets
are owned by others. <BR>
<BR>
<B>W</B>ood's point is that the law should function for those who use it.
Instead of being a spanner in the works, it should oil the machinery. His
fear is that because this degree of comparative analysis has not been undertaken
before, countries are not making informed decisions about the way they develop
their commercial and financial legal systems, and this is leading to horrifically
high cross-border transaction costs and legal uncertainty. Global harmonization
will be driven by countries' realization of which group they belong to and
by a questioning of whether their group's approach is for the best. <BR>
<BR>
Wood hopes his maps - which bankers and admiring lawyers are vying for -
will begin this process. His books are good too and read in some places
almost like John Grisham's legal thrillers. Wood has a wonderful knowledge
of legal and financial history and like the best experts, writes simply
and with enthusiasm. He dispenses with footnotes and tables of cases and
statutes. The six volumes took Wood only one year to write - the volume
on insolvency, just 11 days. <BR>
<BR>
Of his colourful maps, he says: &quot;I wanted them to look like the medieval
stained glass you find in cathedrals. International financial law is like
that - beautiful but completely out of date.&quot;<p>

<H3><B>FINANCIAL LAWYER </B></H3>

<H3>
<B>Cover and the capital markets</H3></B>

<H4><B> Much has been said about convergence between the insurance and capital markets.
But what legal issues are involved?</B>
<BR>
<B>By Christopher Stoakes</B>
</H4>

<P>
Investment bankers have been eyeing up the insurance market for some time. The small size of the reinsurance market &#173; estimated at no more than a few hundred billion dollars &#173; means it lacks the capacity to absorb a succession of catastrophic risks. If the capital markets, whose capacity runs to tens of trillions of dollars, can be tapped, there is money to be made by intermediating bankers. Some have invested in the development of suitable financial products, including research of the legal issues, to determine what they can sell the insurance industry.


<P>
The starting point is to look at insurance companies as asset managers. Insurance, like banking, is a regulated industry. Regulators consider it their duty to protect policyholders. They restrict the assets that insurance companies can value for solvency purposes, to prevent mismatches with liabilities and ensure that assets are prudently managed. Before the implementation of the EC Third Life and Non-Life Directives in July 1994, derivatives were not widely used by insurance companies because they could not generally include them when determining their solvency margins. The directives recognize that insurers can benefit from limited and prudent use of derivative products and provide that the value of derivatives held "in so far as they contribute to a reduction of investment risks or facilitate efficient portfolio management" can be used to cover liabilities.

<P>
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) &#173; the authority that supervises insurance companies in the UK &#173; has issued detailed guidance on the interpretation of these terms, which does not necessarily correspond with that of other regulators. Other tests also have to be satisfied. The intermeshing of EU and UK law means that insurers' use of derivatives is heavily regulated, down to the types of derivative that can be valued, when they can be valued and the value they can be given. Admissibility rules are intended to ensure investment diversification. The underlying asset must itself be admissible. "Gold, for example, is not, so a forward contract for the delivery of gold may not be taken into account," explains Alison Matthews, a solicitor in the insurance group at Freshfields who was previously at the DTI. The derivatives must satisfy liquidity tests designed to ensure that the insurance company could, if necessary, close out its position rapidly. 

<P>
The DTI imposes stringent reporting requirements and has issued guidance for systems of control that insurers are obliged to follow as part of the "sound and prudent management" principles laid down by the Insurance Companies Act 1982. In addition, s35A ICA requires insurers' liabilities to be covered by assets "of appropriate safety, yield and marketability" having regard to the classes of business carried on; and their investments to be appropriately diversified. 

<P>
Banks have examined the possibilities of securitization, using a special purpose vehicle (SPV) established in a tax-neutral jurisdiction to buy insurance risk on the back of which the SPV issues bonds. Here there are two related issues. Is the SPV, in buying risk, acting as an insurance company? If so, the need to be regulated as such would make the deal uneconomic. Secondly, in issuing the bonds, is it acting as a reinsurer? Again, if so, the need to register as such would be too costly. In the UK, the Bank of England recognizes that securitization can remove assets from balance sheets but it is unclear whether the DTI would take the same approach.

<P>
In the case of life companies, securitization could be used to reduce new business strain, the mismatch between accounting for the liability upfront and the inflow of premiums over the contract's life. However, an assignment of the direct right to part of the premiums may contravene s28 ICA, which requires insurers to keep a separate account for their life business and records identifying both the assets and liabilities attributable to that business. Section 29 ring-fences long-term funds of life companies. The release of embedded value by way of a securitization could amount to a breach of the prohibition on transferring assets out of the long-term fund. 


<P>
Turning to insurance companies as risk managers, bankers have tried on and off to develop financial products that would increase the insurance market's capacity. Among the earliest examples were the earthquake bonds launched by issuers such as Electrolux in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These carried low coupons but could be redeemed by the investor if, say, an earthquake occurred in Japan. These bonds were aimed at insurance companies, which in effect were buying reinsurance cover (or at least liquidity) for their risks. Other examples include exchange-traded products, such as the CAT futures on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), and catastrophe bonds. Catastrophe bonds may be created to back liability to an insurer where it responds to a catastrophe, meaning that investors risk losing a corresponding part or the whole of their principal in that event. Similar legal issues arise relating to valuation for solvency purposes (for example, CBOT CAT futures could not be counted in the UK), sound and prudent management, s35A ICA (suitability of assets) and s16 which provides that an insurer may not undertake activities which are otherwise than for the purposes of, or in connection with, its insurance business. In the US, each state has its own investment requirements but, generally, insurance companies with assets of a certain value and type can count derivatives.


<P>
The third area on which bankers have been focusing is the development of financial products as a substitute for insurance. The legal issue is whether risk is really transferred because, if not, the premiums will not be tax-deductible. Finite risk involves a capped (or finite) pay-out under a multi-year contract. The premiums paid fund the pay-out, together with an agreed profit for the insurer. In effect, the insured is merely provisioning by way of an insurance policy since it is bearing the full risk of the loss via the premiums. The benefit is that the insured can spread the risk over the contract period and get a current deduction for the premiums which provisioning for the same risk would not provide. Two questions arise. First, is the contract one of insurance? Secondly, does it comply with Financial Reporting Standard 5, which requires companies to report the substance of transactions? Both are difficult questions, the first because there are general definitions of an insurance contract in English case law but their application to particular types of contract is not always clear; the second because accountants and regulators are aware of finite risk contracts &#173; indeed the Financial Reporting &amp; Auditing Group of the ICAEW (the principal accountants' body in the UK) has issued a detailed technical release on the application of FRS5 to non-life insurance transactions.

<P>
The more sophisticated transactions ensure deductibility by treating part of the premium as a true premium, ie, devoting it to buying insurance cover rather than contributing to the provisioning fund. "You have to slant that blend between tax-efficient provisioning and tax deductibility," says Stephen Revell, a capital markets partner in the insurance group at Freshfields. 

<P>
The insurance company, for its part, is concerned that that receipt of the premium does not amount to deposit-taking &#173; which it would if the contract is not one of insurance &#173; otherwise it will fall foul of banking regulations.

<H3>A SUPPLEMENT TO EUROMONEY/JUNE 1996</H3> <BR>
<H2>The rush to finance Latin energy<BR>
</H2>
<H4><A HREF="#private-sector">Private sector powers ahead <BR>
</A><A HREF="#assets">Taking assets to market</A></H4>

<H2><A NAME="private-sector"></A>Private sector powers ahead </H2>
<H4>As Latin American governments turn to private capital to finance <BR>
the energy sector, opportunities for foreign investors are matched <BR>
only by those in Asia. And when Brazil hits the market, all that <BR>
went before will pale in comparison. Michael Marray reports </H4>
The Latin American energy sector is going through a period of unprecedented
change. In the oil industry, the long-standing taboo against foreign involvement
has been broken - even Venezuela recently signed exploration joint
ventures with the big western oil companies. And in power generation and
distribution, a wave of privatizations is sweeping the region, not only
bringing in players from the developed world but, at the same time, resulting
in growing links between the regional power utilities. <BR>
<BR>
The primary force behind all this is the recognition by Latin American governments
of a pressing need to utilize private sector capital in infrastructure development.
This theme was spelt out during a visit to Chile in May by German foreign
minister Klaus Kinkel, accompanied by a delegation of German businessmen.
During a meeting with Kinkel, Chilean president Eduardo Frei reiterated
his policy of involving the private sector in the development of infrastructure
and stressed the importance of freeing state resources for investment in
social projects. <BR>
<BR>
Similar thinking now prevails in almost all of Latin America. Programmes
to eradicate poverty are getting priority in government spending plans and
the state is leaving areas such as electricity generation and telecommunications.
<BR>
<BR>
The result is opportunities for foreign investors on a scale matched only
in Asia. Developers, financiers and equipment manufacturers from North America,
Europe and Asia are devoting more attention to Latin America than ever before.
<BR>
<BR>
Latin American countries are fortunate in that the export credit agencies
(ECAs) from Europe, Japan and North America see the Latin power sector as
the battlefield for exports of heavy equipment. Support for Latin power
deals from institutions such as US Exim Bank and Overseas Private Investment
Corporation (OPIC) is aggressive and complements support from regional development
institutions such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Latin America has always been the strongest part of the OPIC portfolio:
we are doing more business in Latin America than anywhere else in the world,
with Asia in second place,&quot; says Ruth Harkin, president and chief executive
officer of OPIC, the federal agency that supports private US investment
around the world by lending and providing political risk insurance. &quot;We
are specifically interested in the power sector,&quot; she says. Latin power
projects were targeted in 1993, when she was brought in to head OPIC. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;With all the privatizations, the power sector is ripe for American
investment,&quot; says Harkin. She points out that power projects in developing
countries are seen by the US as the best way to improve the lives of the
people living there. <BR>
<BR>
So far OPIC deals include a 1,320MW Argentine hydroelectric plant for CMS
Generation Corp of Michigan, a 216MW natural gas project in Bolivia for
Energy Initiatives of New Jersey, a 14MW hydro facility in Costa Rica for
General Electric together with the Energy Investors Funds of Massachusetts,
and a 78MW hydro plant in Guatemala for Teco Power of Florida. <BR>
<BR>
Although OPIC raised its finance and insurance limits in 1993 to $200 million
per project, they were almost breached by Colombia's Termobarranquilla project:
OPIC provided $200 million-worth of insurance as well as $150 million in
direct lending. Since then Colombia has been struck from the list of countries
eligible for OPIC support as a result of a diplomatic dispute with the US.
Nonetheless some deals already completed are regarded as models of successfully
financing projects in Latin America. <BR>
<BR>
With a total cost of around $755 million, the Termobarranquilla gas-fired
power station is the biggest independent power project (IPP) so far in Latin
America. Its use of a variety of ECA and commercial credit sources points
the way forward for other projects. The project involves building a 750MW
gas-fired combined-cycle power plant, plus refurbishing an existing 230MW
thermal plant. As usual in IPP deals, the project is underpinned by a long-term
power sales contract bought by state-owned Colombian electricity company
Corporacion Electrica de la Costa Atlantica (Corelca). In spite of state
ownership, the lending banks wanted some sort of guarantee concerning obligations
under the power sales contract. The finance co-arrangers, Paribas and UBS,
were able to bring in Financiera Energetica Nacional (FEN), a division of
the ministry of energy, to back up the Corelca contract. Along with Corelca,
the other sponsors are ABB Energy Ventures, Energy Initiatives and Lancaster
Distral. <BR>
<BR>
The involvement of both OPIC and US Exim were important elements in the
transaction. US Exim stepped up with political risk cover for the $153 million
construction loan and, once construction is completed, will replace the
banks' loans with a $162 million 12-year loan. Meanwhile OPIC is taking
the construction risk, through a $150 million construction loan, and has
also put up $200 million-worth of guarantees. <BR>
<BR>
Bankers agree that although multi-sourcing makes deals more complex, it
also points the way forward. &quot;For the larger deals, there is no one
source of funds that is deep enough,&quot; says Ralph Scholtz, vice-president
of project finance at Paribas in New York. <BR>
<BR>
In the oil sector, US Exim was also a key player in one of the biggest recent
projects in Colombia, in its eastern oil fields. Last December, Ecopetrol,
Colombia's state oil company,<B> </B>signed a 10-year, $566 million syndicated
loan to help finance an 800-kilometre pipeline transporting oil from the
Cusiana and Cuipiagua fields to Covenas on the Caribbean coast, from where
it will be exported. The total cost of this pipeline, which will begin operations
next year, is estimated at $2 billion. A syndicate comprising ABN Amro,
Bank of Tokyo, Paribas, Chemical Bank (now Chase), Deutsche Bank and Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale is involved in the latest financing. The first $270
million tranche is a 10-year commercial loan, while the second five-year
$296 million tranche carries US Exim guarantees. <BR>
<BR>
These high-profile deals were completed before the US decertified Colombia.
The question now being asked in the markets is whether projects can move
forward without big US players such as US Exim and OPIC. Chris Teague, managing
director for project finance for Latin America at Citicorp Securities in
New York, comments: &quot;We believe projects can still get done in the
Colombian market. It will depend on the project: projects which have a substantial
amount of local currency cash flow may, in some circumstances, require some
sort of insurance support to make them viable, but we do not see a problem
for projects which are export-related, such as oil and other natural resource
projects.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Scholtz comments: &quot;The effect of the decertification has been to delay
some projects with equipment to be supplied by US companies, but European
and Japanese exporters are ready to step in and take advantage of opportunities
in Colombia.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Elsewhere in Latin America, Chile is a major source of power generation
business, as the country attempts to keep infrastructure development in
line with its high economic growth. Recently General Electric and Mitsui
successfully bid for a turnkey contract for a natural gas-fired cogeneration
plant supplying the Santiago Electric Company. <BR>
<BR>
The deal centres on the coal-powered Renca plant on the outskirts of the
city, which serves as a backup to be brought online at peak demand periods.
The facility is a contributor to the smog that affects Santiago, and the
building of a gas facility at Renca is viewed as a positive environmental
step. The sponsors of the Renca plant, the first natural gas-fired cogeneration
facility in Chile, include Chilgener, Duke Power of the US and Novacorp
of Canada. Operations will start late in 1997. <BR>
<BR>
More gas-powered projects are anticipated in Chile, where pipelines are
under construction to bring in gas from Argentina. &quot;In Argentina, they
have a balanced generation sector, with gas, oil and hydro-electric,&quot;
notes Pablo Salcedo, head of research at ING Barings in Santiago. &quot;But
in Chile, new development is definitely going to be gas, since it is a good
idea to reduce reliance upon hydro-electricity from current levels of around
80%.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Argentina has many new power projects on the drawing board, though they
tend to be relatively small-scale - generally in the $75 million to
$150 million range. At the Inter-American Development Bank meeting held
in Buenos Aires in March, the IDB signed a $44 million loan for the Consorcio
de Lineas de Transmission, which is building a second 587-kilometre transmission
line linking consumers to its hydro-electric plant in Yacyreta. <BR>
<BR>
Brazil and Bolivia are cooperating in the cross-border transport of natural
gas, a project worth $1.8 billion that could result in a number of gas-fired
power stations in the state of Sao Paulo, the heart of Brazilian industry.
<BR>
<BR>
Brazil remains the country in the region with the most potential for new
power projects. So far it has failed to live up to its promise. Foreign
developers want to see changes in the legal framework before proceeding.
&quot;But when Brazil hits the market it will make everything else look
pale,&quot; is a typical comment from one banker. <BR>
<BR>
Scholtz at Paribas views inside-the-fence deals - power plants supplying
a single industrial host - as a potentially important part of the Brazilian
power sector. &quot;Brazil is moving in that direction because it has a
lot of very high quality industrial companies,&quot; he says. These will
attract investors, particularly as many of them already have close relationships
with foreign banks. <bR><BR><BR>
<H2><A NAME="assets"></A>Taking assets to market </H2>
<H4>As state electricity utitlities come up for sale, buyers from North
America, Japan and Europe are expected to lead the bidding. Within the region
Chilean companies have been fastest of the blocks in the region's privatization
game
</H4>
ING Barings estimates suggest that the amount of private sector financing
(both for new capacity and the privatization of existing assets) in the
years 1996 to 2000 will be 10 times the $5.7 billion seen from 1992 to 1995.
&quot;From Mexico in the north to Argentina in the south, more than 70%
of the electricity sector is still owned by the state,&quot; notes Pablo
Salcedo, head of research at ING Barings in Santiago, &quot;so the opportunities
are huge.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Privatizations in Brazil alone support the ING Barings forecast. At the
end of last month the government sold a controlling stake in Light Servicos
de Electricidade (Light), a distribution company with annual sales of 21,200
gigawatt hours (GWh), to a consortium led by Electricit&eacute; de France.
In 1997 another six distributors are expected to be put up for sale, totalling
another 24,300 GWh. And these do not include Electropaulo, which serves
Sao Paulo - by some estimates the world's largest city. Electropaulo
has annual sales of 54,700 GWh and is expected to be sold by Sao Paulo in
stages between 1997 and 1999. <BR>
<BR>
Buyers for these assets are expected to come from Latin America, as well
as North America, Japan and Europe, with Chile leading the way among the
regional bidders. Chile's own privatization programme is almost complete.
Most power generation assets were sold off in the late 1980s, at which time
foreign ownership was discouraged. But more recent sell-offs have featured
foreign buyers. <BR>
<BR>
Earlier this year the Chilean state-owned copper mining company Codelco
sold a controlling 51% stake in electricity-generating unit Central Termoelectrica
Tocopilla. It was bought by Inversora Electrica Andina, a consortium formed
by Powerfin of Belgium, Iberdrola Energia of Spain and Distribuidora de
Gas Enagas of Chile, for $178 million. With 90% of generation assets in
private hands, Chile's focus is now on building new capacity. <BR>
<BR>
One last major privatization remains in Chile: Colbun, the third-largest
generator in Chile, with nearly all capacity produced from hydro-electric
plants, is down to be sold before the end of the year. The winning bidder
for the initial 37.5% stake will also acquire an option to take a controlling
stake. Colbun is the last big electricity utility to be privatized, and
the Chilean government has stipulated that the buyer must not already control
more than 5% of supplies to the central grid - effectively excluding
both Chilgener and Endesa. Substantial foreign interest is expected. <BR>
<BR>
Other Chilean companies are looking to their regional neighbours to expand.
Endesa and Enersis registered in the bidding process for the privatization
of Rio de Janeiro's electricity utility Light Servicos de Electricidade
before deciding not to participate. At present only 4% of electricity sales
in Brazil are made by private distributors: the privatization process is
expected to be the major source of electricity assets between now and the
year 2000. <BR>
<BR>
Chilean companies have also been among the bidders in neighbouring Argentina,
where some $2.2 billion-worth of generation assets have been sold off so
far, taking the level of private participation in the electricity generation
sector to 60%. Central Puerto was acquired by Chilgener and Chilquinta,
while Piedra Del Aguila was bought by a consortium including Chilgener and
Duke Energy of the US. Chilean companies have also featured strongly as
buyers of distribution companies: in Argentina, Enersis, Chilectra and Chilgener
have acquired assets. And Peruvian distribution company Edelnor was bought
by a consortium including local investors, plus Endesa of Spain and Chilectra
and Enersis of Chile. <BR>
<BR>
Salcedo at ING Barings expects to see more Chilean involvement, since Chilean
companies have strong balance sheets and access to deep domestic capital
markets. &quot;I don't think the limit is capital; one of the challenges
of these companies is management,&quot; he says. &quot;Chile will continue
to export capital and management, but this also means taking additional
risk.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Electricity generation and distribution may form the bulk of sales in the
energy sector, but there is also a high level of activity in oil and gas.
Free market rules do not always apply in this sector, since most governments
remain committed to maintaining a major role for the state in oil exploration,
or at least keeping control of oil companies in local hands. Nonetheless
there are still plenty of opportunities, particularly in joint ventures
with profit-sharing exploration agreements. <BR>
<BR>
The most significant development of 1996 was in Venezuela, which until its
recent bout of economic troubles had a commitment to state ownership. Earlier
this year foreign companies were invited to bid on contracts involving exploration
and profit-sharing with state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela.
The contracts run for 29 years once production gets under way, and allow
foreign companies to conduct exploration within 4.5 million-acre blocks,
with a minimum investment of $40 million per block. The bidding process
was judged a success, with a total of eight fields auctioned off. The successful
bidders included Mobil, Amoco, British Petroleum, Dupont, Elf-Aquitane and
Enron. <BR>
<BR>
Elsewhere in Latin America, in January Colombian state-owned oil company
Ecopetrol disposed of its 39% stake in Promigas; Enron purchased the Promigas
shares for $100 million. Next to be sold in Colombia is Ecopetrol's stake
in Gas Natural, a gas distributor in Bogota. In Peru the government is also
privatizing many state-owned companies, including some in the energy sector.

<H3>EDITORIAL</H3> 
<H2>The feel-bad factor </H2>
Business is booming for Wall Street investment banks. Most had a record
first quarter; many are forecasting that 1996 will be a bumper year, perhaps
even on a par with 1993. <BR>
<BR>
But the mood among a lot of investment bankers is one of gloom. The past
two months have seen more finance professionals switching jobs that at any
time we can remember. There is a general dissatisfaction among investment
bankers with the size of their compensation, particularly with the meagreness
of the bonuses many received in March and April to reward them for their
efforts last year. <BR>
<BR>
There are times when, almost unconsciously, <I>Euromoney</I> reflects the
mood of the financial markets by a coincidence of the subjects we choose
to cover. Many of the articles in this month's <I>Euromoney</I> reflect
the upheaval of personnel in New York and London. <BR>
<BR>
A number of factors have come together to produce the current mood. Investment
banks are probably more tightly managed than ever before. After the down-turn
in 1994, when profits plummeted, many banks cut staff drastically and pared
bonuses. Employees found it hard to complain: they could see the poor profitability
and, besides, had nowhere else to go. But the banks continued to pay poorly
in 1995, even though profits recovered. Having long wanted to bring the
financial industry's compensation back to a more realistic level, many saw
a chance to cut costs. <BR>
<BR>
The (mostly well-merited) cost-cutting clashed with a dash by a number of
firms - mostly European banks - to build up their businesses.
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, UBS and SBC Warburg have all been spending heavily
to hire the best traders and corporate financiers. <BR>
<BR>
As a result the investment banking industry is probably more competitive
than ever. In the bond issues market, for instance, until recently the top
tier comprised fewer than 10 players. Now, even those firms between numbers
15 and 20 (BZW, HSBC Markets or Dresdner-Kleinwort Benson, for example)
can be considered world-class houses. It is hard to think of any field in
which competition has not dramatically increased in the past 12 months.
<BR>
<BR>
The shakeout will come. While markets remain strong - and while the
interest-rate environment stays stable - this bloated lead-group can
probably stay profitable. But, when the next major correction in world stock
markets - or a significant jump in interest rates - hits, there
will inevitably be retrenchment, pull-outs and collapses. <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>
<H2>Regulatory hit-squads </H2>
What's the missing link that explains all the financial disasters of the
past 10 years? Is it failure to appreciate the redemption rates of principal-only
mortgage tranches; the mispricing of interest rate caps or over-the-counter
bond options; over-aggressive arbitrage between Nikkei futures contracts?
According to the latest thinking on risk management, it was none of these
things. Misunderstanding the numbers game is not the answer. The wild card,
in each case, was homo sapiens - and the key to pre-empting more positional
disasters is not bigger and better risk management systems, although they
might help, it is ensuring the character and competence of the man or woman
in charge. <BR>
<BR>
This sounds like a truism. But in fact the armies of risk management consultants,
supervisors, dealers, and senior managers can offer no better safeguard
against another Barings, Daiwa, Kidder, than to ensure that the responsible
manager is ethical and competent and pro-active. The UK Banking Act's concept
of a &quot;fit and proper person&quot; does not quite fit the bill. The
Bank of England might well have regarded the top managers at Barings as
fit and proper, but what the supervisors and top managers failed to check
out in the Barings case was the relationship between the fit and proper
persons at home and the lean and mean operator in some far-flung outpost,
so small and understaffed that it hardly bore thinking about. <BR>
<BR>
The supervisors of global firms, far from despairing at their impossible
task, are attempting to chip at it through harmonization of capital standards,
global accounting practices, and liaison with their counterparts in other
jurisdictions. But this may prove to be little more than displacement activity.
Global firms are riding the tiger while supervisors catch at its shadow.
<BR>
<BR>
The answer to their dilemma may be to pass their responsibilities to the
private sector. What is so absurd about hiring a team, or better, competing
teams of vigilante supervisors? These globe-trotting hit-squads would have
sweeping powers to seek out and destroy systemic risk. Their reward would
be a proportion of the burden that they save those punchbags, the lenders
of last resort. How would this work? Charles Taylor, former G30 Wunderkind
and now associate partner at Andersen Consultants, can surely work out the
details. <BR>

<H3> PHILIPPINES </H3>


<H2> <B>Private sector looks to the markets  </B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>The Philippine
government is recruiting the private sector to develop and upgrade the country's
infrastructure. But how will the private sector raise the financing it needs on
the international capital markets? By Maggie Ford</B> </H4> 

<P> At the corner of
Ayala Avenue, the main street in Manila's central business district of Makati,
stands a small library containing historical books, photographs and documents. As
the former control tower of an American military airport, the library premises
are themselves a curious relic of the past. The avenue, now lined with the
headquarters of the biggest Philippine corporations, started life as the
airport's runway.

<P> Fifty years on, the Philippines is obsessed again with trains, boats and
planes, not to mention telephones, power stations and roads. A massive campaign
to upgrade the country's infrastructure is under way, with $50 billion worth of
projects on the drawing board.

<P> It is not before time. Manila has thoroughly outgrown its 1960s-vintage
infrastructure. (Years of dereliction and cronyism under the Marcos government
before 1986 stifled planning.) Traffic jams are ubiquitous, water pipes date back
to the late 19th century and in 1992 electricity shortages almost brought the
economy to a complete halt.

<P> Those "brownouts" galvanized the government. The private sector was mobilized
and the power shortage was cured within months. Four years later, the Philippines
has emerged as a major destination for private-sector investment in
infrastructure &#173; one of only two developing Asian nations reckoned by the
World Bank to have grasped the complexities of attracting private firms into this
arena.

<P> In 1995 the Philippines and Indonesia between them raised almost $4 billion
worth of international financing &#173; for two power station projects &#173; out
of a total of only $5 billion committed to private infrastructure projects in
Asia. This is just the start, according to Philippine financial secretary Roberto
De Ocampo.

<P> "We have already privatized the main power supplier Meralco, along with
Philippine Air Lines and the Manila port company," he says. "One third of our
power is supplied by independents and that will rise to 100% by the end of the
decade. Around 35 private-sector projects worth $5 billion are almost or fully
complete."

<P> The involvement of the private sector has been so successful that it is now
being extended to road building, railways, water supplies and telecommunications.
Financing will come from syndicated lending, multilateral and other concessional
loans, equity and bond issues on the local and international markets, and further
privatizations.

<P> The biggest push involves transport, with a complex range of projects to
capitalize on the infrastructure the Philippines inherited from the US military.
When the American troops pulled out of the Subic Bay naval base and Clark air
base north of the capital, they left behind some of the best facilities in the
country.

<P> The government established the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA)
to develop a plan to maximize the benefit of the two bases, each of which
occupies 2,000 hectares of land. Subic Bay is already attracting substantial
foreign investment to its export industry zone, while Clark Air Force base is to
become Manila's new airport. Fort Bonifacio, another military base in central
Manila occupied by the Philippine army, has also been integrated into an
ambitious scheme to transform the capital.

<P> Fort Bonifacio is to be developed into a new 440-hectare city and transport
hub, with offices and residential apartments for 300,000 residents and one
million workers, hotels and entertainment centres, hospitals and a new university
campus. Surrounded by 214 hectares of parks and golf courses, the city will be
linked by conventional high-speed trains to Clark City and to the existing
international airport. Travellers will go by underground light rail to the Makati
business district nearby. Road access to an existing ring-road and to the new
Manila Skyway toll road, now under construction, will be built.

<P> The BCDA holds a 45% stake in the Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation,
owned by a consortium of 17 companies. Its controlling shareholder is the listed
Metro Pacific Corp, local subsidiary of First Pacific, the Hong Kong-based arm of
Indonesia's giant Salim conglomerate. Metro beat prominent rivals to buy the
Bonifacio site for $1.6 billion a year ago at Ps33,000 per square metre. It has
already sold on 16 hectares at Ps180,000 per square metre, raising $1 billion to
finance initial clearing costs.

<P> Phase one of the development is a two-stage plan &#173; known as the North
Rail Project &#173; to build the link from Fort Bonifacio to the planned new
airport. The high-speed rail line will eventually mean a journey time of 55
minutes from Bonifacio to Clark. A spur line will later connect Clark to Subic
Bay. "The runway at Clark is very strong, built to take the Challenger space
shuttle," says Jaime Ladao, chief financial officer of the BCDA. "Two-thirds of
the cost of an airport are the land and the runway. What we need now is the
terminal and the transport links to the capital."

<P> Costing $400 million, the first stage is being funded by Spanish supplier
credits and the government, which already owned the railway land. The heavy rail
line will initially terminate north of Manila. Construction of the stretch to
Fort Bonifacio is estimated to cost $1.5 billion, including tunnelling costs.

<P> North Rail is being developed by a joint venture whose shareholders include
the Bases Authority, Spanish rail, DMCI, a locally-listed property developer and
the developers of Fort Bonifacio.

<P> Jos&eacute; Noel de la Paz, vice-president at Bankers Trust, which advised
the consortium on the Fort Bonifacio bid, says the developers will be seeking to
raise $1.4 billion for North Rail. The mix looks like $600 million in export
credits, $400 million in bonds, $400 million in onshore and offshore syndicated
loans, and the rest in multilateral loans.

<P> "This is a very high-profile project with strong government support," says de
la Paz. "Of course lenders will be looking for guarantees, direct and indirect.
But this should be a quality project, very well planned with good services."

<P> Also planned is another rail link to the existing Ninoy Aquino International
Airport, where a consortium of six local ethnic-Chinese Filipino companies,
challenged to contribute to national development by president Ramos, are to
construct a new terminal. The existing facility, which is small, overcrowded and
dingy, is a source of great shame to the Filipino business sector.

<P> The Fort Bonifacio project is planned over 20 years and may need that amount
of time to avoid creating a massive property glut. It will be the fourth business
district in Manila, with both Makati and the newer Ortigas business districts
continuing to put up new towers. The old Manila Bay area is being developed into
a convention, tourism, leisure and exhibition centre.

<P> Makati was originally developed as a residential area by Ayala Land, the
prominent listed company which missed out on the Bonifacio contract with a 30%
lower bid. Makati established itself as the main central business district but
was challenged by the Ortigas family in the 1980s. Its development in Manduluyong
attracted the new Philippines Stock Exchange, the Asian Development Bank
headquarters and the head office of San Miguel Corp, along with a giant mega-mall
shopping centre, a five-star hotel and residential accommodation.

<P> Ayala Land's profitability has not, however, been dented by Ortigas, which is
located only a few kilometres from Makati but can take more than one hour by car
to reach in heavy traffic. The popularity of the Ortigas mega-mall is creating
its own traffic problem.

<P> <B>Investing in infrastructure</B>

<P> Analysts believe that tight competition in the property sector could slow
down Fort Bonifacio's development, but they also think it could benefit from a
flight to quality in the event of a glut. The developer will spend Ps24 billion
on infrastructure for the city and plans to develop parts of the project &#173;
such as water supply, a hospital and the city management &#173; through joint
ventures.

<P> The project's main private-sector shareholder, Metro Pacific, is also a
shareholder in Smart Communications, a telephone company which controls both land
and cellular telephone line concessions in the district containing the project,
offering potential access to communications which Makati cannot provide.

<P> Bonifacio Development Corp will fund two high-rise towers internally and sell
the rest of the sites to developers, which must follow its master plan. Metro
Pacific launched a $135 million convertible bond earlier this year, but the
future financial strategy for Fort Bonifacio is still being discussed with the
wide selection of international investment banks now seeking advisory mandates in
Manila. A further bond issue and an initial public offering of shares next year
are likely.

<P> The government is watching over the private-sector involvement in
infrastructure carefully, both to minimize its own risks and costs, and to
promote synergy in order to reduce the competition for scarce financing.
Unbundling risks and allocating them according to ability to pay is the aim,
according to finance secretary De Ocampo.

<P> "For instance, on road or rail projects we can give a guarantee of toll-fee
or fare levels, and compensation in case of political problems," he says. "But
traffic volume is a risk to the developers. If we allow the private sector to
transfer risks to the government, we're just kidding ourselves."

<P> An official "swat team" was sent in to look at a $650 million mass rail
transit project by a local consortium. It was able to identify<B> </B>savings
through technical cooperation between departments. The consortium was then able
to raise financing from the capital markets without a mooted government subsidy
of $100 million.

<P> On foreign exchange convertibility the government will give guarantees, but
on <I>force majeure</I>, such as earthquakes, to which the Philippines is prone,
only large damage levels are likely to be covered.

<P> The government's challenge next year will be the privatization of the
Metropolitan Water and Sewerage System, a build-operate-transfer project under
which Manila will be divided into two districts. Private-sector companies will
bid for the concession to operate and upgrade the system. Foreign companies and
the World Bank, plus other multilateral agencies, are expected to take part. Also
on the drawing board is the privatization of the electricity grid.

<P> To help clear the funding logjam, De Ocampo is pushing foreign governments to
reconsider their policies on lending to the Philippines. Regulators in some
European countries and Japan require their commercial banks to make loan-loss
provision for up to 35% of lending to the Philippines.

<P> The regulations are a hangover from the early 1980s when Manila was forced to
reschedule all its foreign debt. Japan is owed around $11.6 billion of the
Philippines total foreign debt of $39.4 billion. De Ocampo has asked Tokyo to
drop the regulation before 1998, when it is due to expire, since it is a major
disincentive to Japanese banks considering loans to the Philippines.

<P> He notes that the Japan Investment Credit Agency has already rated the
Philippines as investment grade and the Philippine government issued a successful
samurai bond raising &#165;40,000 ($370 million) in July.

<P> But he also believes that local markets need to be further developed to
provide more capital. Among the planned improvements are  the expansion of mutual
funds and regulatory changes  &#173; such as longer-term treasury bills &#173; to
boost the local bond market.

<P> The shortage of local capital is forcing companies to be more creative in
accessing international markets for capital. Infrastructure companies are leading
the way, both in equity offerings on the newly-revitalized Philippine Stock
Exchange, which is dominated by foreign institutional investors, and in bonds,
mostly on the US market.

<P> "Financial advisers are generally telling companies that are already listed
that they should raise their international profile by issuing international
bonds," says de la Paz of Bankers Trust. Philippine companies, still often
dominated by families, are frequently averse to diluting ownership through stock
sales or rights issues.

<P> Those with big expansion plans have to go to the international markets, as
locally available funds are no longer adequate. "Companies are aiming to
diversify funding sources, so as to keep local money free for short-term
borrowing," says Valentine Araneta, operations manager of the Philippine National
Bank (PNB), which was recently privatized.

<P> Apart from Metro Pacific, other infrastructure companies like Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co (PLDT), Philippine Telephone Corporation (Piltel),
Filinvest Land, Ayala Corp and Bauang Private Power have sought funding from bond
issues over the past year. A total of $1.5 billion has been raised this year
&#173; with initial public offerings, mainly from cement companies in a weak
market, reaching only $425 million.

<P> <B>Project finance tempts investors</B>

<P> Ayala International Finance launched the Philippine's appearance in the
convertible market last year with a $100 million five-year Eurobond led by
Jardine Fleming. Although it was launched at a difficult time, it was a success
and was followed by the highly successful $150 million Euromarket high-yield bond
issue by National Power Corp. The issue had a government guarantee and was rated
BB by Standard and Poor's. It carried a coupon of 9% with a seven-year tenor and,
as the first bond from the Philippines to achieve this, it was heavily
oversubscribed.

<P> National Power has set up a medium-term note programme, a scheme also
favoured by PLDT and the Philippine National Bank. These shelf programmes give
broad documentation to the company, reducing listing, legal and other costs for
individual issues. National Power has a $500 million Euro-MTN programme, while
PNB has a $400 million programme.

<P> So far the international markets have viewed Philippine infrastructure
project financing deals favourably. The $1.35 billion deal for the 1,200-megawatt
power station at Sual in Pangasinan province, one of Asia's largest, was arranged
in record time in 1995.

<P> The project's sponsor was Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA), a
subsidiary of Hong Kong tycoon Gordon Wu's Hopewell Holdings, which has a 25-year
build-operate-transfer deal to supply power to the National Power Corporation.
The deal was syndicated in only four weeks, despite the involvement of numerous
participants and export credit agencies from Britain, France and the US. The deal
encouraged some European commercial banks which had shunned the country since
1983, to resume lending to the Philippines.

<P> Other companies are expected to capitalize on this success later this year
and next. Smart Communications, the Metro Pacific subsidiary, may be first off
the mark with an initial public offering on the PSE later this year, raising $200
million.

<P> The local firms developing the new terminal at Manila's present airport,
grouped in a company called Asia's Emerging Dragon Corporation (AEDC), will be
seeking $450 million in primarily debt financing and may seek a public listing
later.

<P> Also likely to be seeking funds is a consortium which includes Ayala Land and
Penta Capital. It is to construct a light rail system down the middle of Manila's
famous Edsa Boulevard &#173; the scene of the "people power" demonstrations which
toppled the Marcos regime in 1986. As a key artery, Edsa is frequently jammed
with traffic. Unclogging it will be a powerful symbol that the Philippines can
achieve economically what has already achieved in politics.

<H3> <B>DEAL INSIDER</B>  <br><I>&#009;Sophie R&ouml;ell </I> </H3> <H3> <B>Speed was of the
essence</B> </H3> <P> <B>Issuer: People's Republic of China</B><br>

<B>Amount: $1 billion</B><br>

<B>Launched: June 28/July 1 1996</B><br>

<B>Lead managers: CS First Boston and &#009;&#009;Morgan Stanley</B>

<P> It is not as if the People's Republic of China (PRC) has a glittering track
record in global bond issuance. Only two years ago a $1 billion 10-year global
led by Merrill Lynch widened from 85 basis points at issuance to a high of 160bp
in the secondary market. So it was only natural to expect investors to be
sceptical  when the PRC came to market again in June.

<P> As it turned out, the $700 million five-year global &#173; led this time by
CS First Boston and Morgan Stanley &#173; was three times oversubscribed, setting
the scene for a further $300 million 10-year issue within a matter of days. About
half of the five-year bond was sold in Europe, 30% in Asia and 20% in the US.

The formula was straightforward. According to one banker:
"It was the easiest deal we've ever done." There aren't many China issues
available and the roadshow &#173; which took place as sovereign analysts were
arguing that the PRC should be rerated from A3/BBB to mid to weak A &#173;
convinced investors that the Chinese economy was in good shape.

<P> The lead managers were impressed by the sophisticated approach to the deal by
China's finance ministry. Key figures were senior vice-minister Liu Jibin, who is
in charge of the national budget and international activities, and Gao Jian,
director of the ministry's state debt management department.

<P> The ministry's first priority was to raise the profile of PRC debt among
European investors.  Although in the past three years China has issued a Euroyen
bond, a dragon bond, a global and several samurais, plus a yankee in January,
"they never felt they had dedicated sufficient attention to expanding the
European investment base," says Carl Walter, director and chief representative of
CSFB in Beijing. A global directed at Europe seemed the best way to do this, and
still involve US and Asian investors. "To some extent it was a transition ... to
a European focus," says Gao. "I think in future the European capital market will
play a more important role than ever before."

<P> The ministry of finance had been talking to investment banks since the end of
1995 about targeting European investors, but an issue could not be arranged until
the 1996 budget was formally approved by the National People's Congress, China's
parliament, in March. According to Gao, ministry officials believed that in terms
of market conditions "the first half of the year would be better than the second
half &#173; so we had a very short interval of time for preparation".

<P> Morgan Stanley and CSFB were mandated in mid-May. "We selected Merrill Lynch
and JP Morgan for the [January $400 million] Yankee bond deal," says Gao. "It's
not pure rotation but we will give each leading firm a chance." The PRC already
had a shelf listing with the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission &#173; with
$1.1 billion left on it &#173; from the January yankee. That had only to be
updated and legal documentation was in place.

<P> The lead managers set a target to finish the deal before the US July 4
holiday weekend. To  achieve this, the roadshow was split in two. On June 17, Liu
Jibin kicked off the Asian roadshow in Seoul. Gao led the team to the US and the
two teams met up in London on June 20 for the European presentation (which
included a trip to Luxembourg, where the bond was to be listed). The five-year
$700 million issue was launched on June 26 and priced the following day.

<P> The roadshow had started without a very clear idea of the deal structure
&#173; beyond its being a US dollar global. "When we went in and did a
presentation we didn't say 'welcome to the roadshow for a five- and 10-year
tranche of a PRC global bond, the pricing ranges x, y and z'," says CSFB's
Walter. "Then people think 'well if that's what it is, is there any value
there?', and they don't really focus on the China story so much. We wanted to
avoid that, and let them focus on what the minister and Dr Gao were trying to
convey about China. Our advice to them was that, if you want to get a good deal,
you develop momentum for the deal and let the market tell you what it wants." The
deal size was also to depend on how well it went down.

As it happened, the paper was snapped up, particularly by
Asian investors: $700 million was launched at 80bp over US treasuries and was two
to three times oversubscribed. Even the underwriters were taken by surprise.
"People in the syndicate were thinking it was going to be a hard sell," says one,
"because of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Sino-US relations."

<P> PRC finance ministry officials were also pleased. "I myself did not expect
such strong demand for the five-year," says Gao. "But I met a lot of US investors
and I think they had a good memory of the yankee bond deal. I think the
successful yankee issue really paved the way for the successful global &#173; it
gave the investors confidence."

<P> But not enough confidence to let finance ministry officials off without a
grilling during the roadshow. "They asked a lot of questions," says Gao. Some
were "good" questions, he adds; in others, investors displayed "their own logic"
&#173; a rather cryptic way of saying that investors, particularly outside Asia,
have some peculiar ideas of what is going on in China.

<P> Political questions &#173; regarding Sino-US relations and the crisis in the
Taiwan Strait in February &#173; came mainly from US investors. "They're more
politically sensitive," says Gao. But the officials did not find the questions
awkward. He says investors were told: "We are confident that the country is
moving forward. We believe the reform and open-door policy will be continued in
the future, even with the political succession, because it is in the interests of
the majority of the people. And that is not just political propaganda."

<P> Still, the biggest selling point was the economy. Inflation has been brought
under control, GDP growth is slowing but strong and foreign exchange reserves
(over $80 billion) are among the highest in the world. "The economic fundamentals
all look terrific," says CSFB's Walter.

<P> Demand was strong but not sufficient to warrant a 10-year tranche to the
deal, another objective the finance ministry had in mind. Then on June 28
treasuries rallied dramatically. Combined with the momentum built up by the
five-year, a 10-year tranche suddenly became possible.

<P> The lead managers phoned the ministry team, who were still in Europe. "The
lead managers were still very suspicious about the demand for a 10-year maturity,
but they wished to try," says Gao. By midday Liu Jibin had told them to proceed
with the 10-year. Pre-marketing began that day, and a $300 million deal was
launched and priced &#173; at 110bp &#173; on July 1. This issue was also two to
three times oversubscribed &#173; US investors took 80%, 10% went to Europe and
10% to Asia.

<P> The rapid response to market changes won the finance ministry &#173; a
relative newcomer to international capital markets &#173; a lot of respect. After
a first deal in 1987, it began issuing regularly only in 1993. "Over the past
three years the ministry has become more sophisticated in how it approaches the
market and how it responds to the market," says CSFB's Walter. "The fact that the
vice-minister and his team were able to respond so rapidly to a change in market
conditions to launch the 10-year is really an indication of that."

<P> Ministry officials say the main lesson they have learnt since 1994 is the
need to "establish a long-term relationship with investors". Gao says: "We have
to give confidence to the investors that the Chinese government is a responsible
participant in the market." It is not just about "raising capital but
establishing market status". Not pushing too hard on pricing is an important
aspect of that and the ministry is keen to be relatively "generous".

<P> The speed of the 10-year launch meant that the syndicate missed out on
potential profits from trading. The lead managers decided they should receive
underwriting fees but not be allocated any bonds. Walter says: "We had a very
large syndicate; we knew if we were going to do 10 years, we had to do it all in
the US and we had a very short period of time to get the deal done in. We wanted
to simplify the whole procedure, so Morgan Stanley and we just did it. Given the
time constraints we had, we didn't have a choice."&#009;

<B><H3>FRONT END - <I>Edited by Steven Irvine</I></H3><BR>
</B>
<H2>No bulls, but a few polar bears </H2>
Julian Johnson, downing a pint of beer as part of his training, says going
to the magnetic North Pole will make a change from sitting in a windowless
basement trading US government bonds. The manager of the London office of
Aubrey G Lanston, a subsidiary of Industrial Bank of Japan, says the six-week
trek, beginning in April, will be aided by two skidoo vehicles, three airborne
food drops, and the expertise of the team leader, David Hempleman Adams,
one of the UK's foremost experts on Arctic expeditions. <BR>
<BR>
Johnson made the last 10 of this novices' challenge, which will be filmed
by the BBC, from an original 400 applicants who saw an advert in the newspaper.
During the six-month selection process the Cambridge University rugby blue
underwent a host of physical tests including a two-hour spell in a freezer
in London's Smithfield market. His 14 years of experience in the bond markets
will not be totally useless either. &quot;You've got to take risks and put
up with mental and emotional pain on a trip like this,&quot; he smiles,
noting temperatures get as low as -50 degrees Celcius. <BR>
<BR>
But before departing on their 300-mile journey to Ellef Ringes Island, the
current site of the magnetic North Pole, the team must spend a day on a
police rifle range. Team leader Hempleman Adams is taking three rifles,
and no chances. He woke up on a previous trip in 1984 to find a polar bear
peering into his tent. <BR>
<BR>
Johnson, while doing the expedition for &quot;the adventure&quot;, hopes
also to raise money for Children in Crisis. He is looking for sponsorship
from institutions in the City of London. The money will go towards the charity's
work in Chernobyl. <B>Steven Irvine<BR>
<BR>
</B><HR> 
<H3>An unusually liquid investment </H3>
Inside London's St Paul's Tavern, Billy Whitbread sups his first pint. He
thinks it highly hopped and attenuated - a process whereby you get as much
alcohol out of the sugar solution as possible. &quot;It's Gales or Pedigree,&quot;
he concludes, verging finally on the former, because Pedigree &quot;has
more of an effect on my head&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately Whitbread - a member of one of the UK's leading brewing families,
and now a consultant to a new specialist fund, the Taverners Trust, dedicated
to investing in public houses - is wrong. The brew he was tasting was Shepherd
Neame, a distinctive beer made in Faversham in Kent. <BR>
<BR>
Whitbread and Christopher Fishwick, a fund manager at Aberdeen Trust, which
is arranging the new fund, were participating in <I>Euromoney</I>'s special
beer challenge, launched to commemorate the first beer fund in the UK. The
trust has already raised &#163;15 million from those who love beer all over
the City. <BR>
<BR>
Whitbread learnt how to brew from Peter Scully, the master brewer of Ipswich-based
Tolly Cobbold. His father, Colonel Whitbread, ran one of the UK's top four
brewers, Whitbread, until 1968. Billy Whitbread's financial expertise was
gained running the Whitbread Investment Company, which obtained 16% annual
net asset growth over 10 years. <BR>
<BR>
Billy spent much of the 1980s negotiating with regional brewers, and says
a lot of the people he was negotiating with are now running the companies.
He has been instructed to visit two or three pubs a week, to gain market
intelligence. Did you know, he says, that the trend towards bars with large-windowed
facades is aimed at attracting women, who prefer to see inside a pub before
entering? Women buy higher-margin drinks, he adds. <BR>
<BR>
Back in the tavern, he judges that the second pint is Adnams, a mild East
Anglian beer, not highly hopped. Wrong again, it's Brakspear. On the third
pint he detects a highly sulphurous smell and deduces it must be Pedigree
- his favourite tipple - before changing his mind as a result of the yeast.
<I>Euromoney</I> awards half a point for being so close - it was Pedigree.
<BR>
<BR>
He explains the trust will also invest in regional brewers, of which there
are around 60 in the UK. Only 25% of the portfolio will be in illiquid stocks.
<BR>
<BR>
The final beer is 6X, he says, because of its rounded taste and combination
of hops. In fact, it's Fuggles. At that point he laughs, he's scored half
a point out of five, and says that he will not choose his stocks by &quot;drinking
the beer&quot;. He is very much a &quot;fundamentals man - reports and accounts&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
The challenge ends. Fishwick, the fund manager - who says the fund is part
of Abtrust's strategy of &quot;getting more and more specialized&quot; -
scores a straight zero.<B> SI<BR>
<BR>
</B><HR> 
<H3>Deutsche Merrill Grenfell </H3>
More high-profile ructions at the London office of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell
(DMG). Senior debt-origination director Abigail Hofman walked out the door
into Leadenhall Street for the last time in March, disillusioned at the
direction the bank is taking. She will be missed, especially as she has
a particularly strong relationship with Deutsche's most important client,
the World Bank, and also the Inter-American Development Bank. A key part
of the three-strong debt funding group headed by Roy Boecker, she had yet
to accept other job offers at the time <I>Euromoney </I>went to press. <BR>
<BR>
Two days after she handed in her resignation on March 18, Edson Mitchell
was in London and tried to persuade her to change her mind. Having arrived
from Merrill Lynch four years ago to join a &quot;European bank&quot;, she
was said to be upset by her feeling of <I>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</I>. In
the past nine months, 43 Merrill staff have followed their old boss, now
DMG's head of global markets, Edson Mitchell. One German newspaper recently
referred to the Edson Mitchell &quot;sect&quot;, which has formed. <BR>
<BR>
The latest recruit is John Winter, recruited by Mitchell as a Merrill graduate
trainee in the 1980s, and brought over from his position as head of German
capital markets at Merrill's Frankfurt office. He will head Deutsche's debt
capital markets in London, and will report to joint global heads of debt
Grant Kvalheim in New York (ex-Merrill) and Hans Werner Voigt in Frankfurt
(not ex-Merrill). <BR>
<BR>
Winter's appointment has unsettled the power structure in London. The debt
funding group, of which Hofman was a part, felt particularly worried by
the change, and the new approach to origination strategy it might involve.
<BR>
<BR>
However, a DMG spokesman says the influx of Merrill people must be looked
at in perspective. Since the beginning of 1995 the bank has recruited 185
people globally, so &quot;in the scale of things, it is not huge&quot;.
<B>SI<BR>
<BR>
</B><HR> 
<H3>Comic move for Barings boss </H3>
One of the UK's rudest magazines,<I>Viz</I>, has recruited the services
of ex-Barings Securities boss, Peter Norris. The blue-blooded banker has
moved to a magazine whose comic strip characters include Sid the Sexist,
the Fat Slags and Biffer Bacon, the last of whom spends most of his time
doing bodily harm to his parents. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Viz</I>, which is one of the profanest and funniest publications in the
UK, sells about half a million copies and was started by two brothers in
Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1979. It is not supposed to be sold to little children.
<BR>
<BR>
Norris joins as a non-executive director of the magazine's holding company,
John Brown Publishing, and will work two days a week to cast a fresh eye
on the business. <BR>
<BR>
Nor will it be Norris's first stint at the company. When it was founded
in 1987 by John Brown, he worked there temporarily as a non-paid company
secretary. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Viz </I>editor Chris Donald says the appointment does not surprise him
because John Brown &quot;likes to employ old friends and failed bankers.
For some reason, John thinks investment bankers are good at running smutty
magazines.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Adds Donald: &quot;John would give Nick Leeson a job if he was available
- as his personal financial adviser.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Does Norris reads <I>Viz</I>? &quot;He has to now. He gets one free,&quot;
replies Brown. <B>Steven Irvine<BR>
<BR>
</B><HR> 
<H3>Cynical attack on central banker </H3>
Russian assassins do not generally fire six shots without hitting anything.
Russia's killing industry, at least, is world class. For this reason, Moscow
police were inclined to see the amateurish March 18 attack on central bank
chairman Sergei Dubinin's apartment as a coincidence. <BR>
<BR>
High state officials have so far been immune from the murder wave sweeping
finance and industry, and apparently feel confident about remaining so.
The government apartment block which Dubinin recently moved to had no visible
security, despite a recent near-fatal attack on a legislator who also lives
there. <BR>
<BR>
Yet neither the method nor the object of the attack quite added up. Russian
gangsters like to hit at their targets directly, leaving women and children
out of range. The standard warning mechanism is to destroy a car. By firing
wildly from the street into a fourth-storey window, while Dubinin's family
awaited his return, his attackers hardly advertised their seriousness. <BR>
<BR>
Consequently an arrest warrant was issued on the uniquely Russian charge
of &quot;malicious hooliganism distinguished by its content of exceptional
cynicism&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
It is also hard to think what the assailants might want from the affable
central bank chief. Rumours immediately circulated that powerful Moscow
region boss Konstantin Shor had also been assaulted twice in recent weeks,
though his spokesman insisted that he was &quot;not aware of any concrete
attempts&quot; against his boss's life. Killing to reduce interest rates
or reserve requirements struck observers as a more abstract goal than the
Mafia usually sets itself. <BR>
<BR>
The business daily <I>Commersant</I> leapt in with an elaborate theory about
Chara Bank, a boutique investment fund for the Moscow/St Petersburg intelligentsia.
This collapsed in late 1994 with debts of $200 million, but the paper pointed
out that its licence was finally revoked only days before the shooting.
<BR>
<BR>
But Moscow security circles remain unimpressed. &quot;Sometimes a guy like
this will stage the event himself to increase his political standing,&quot;
growls Sergei Stepnov, a veteran homicide detective who now heads the Lions
detective agency. <BR>
<BR>
Sources close to the laid-back Dubinin, who was vice-president of Bank Imperial
before being drafted back into public service, found this version of events
less than credible. <B>Craig Mellow </B><p>

<H3>A SUPPLEMENT TO EUROMONEY - DECEMBER 1995 </H3>
<H2>Latin America becomes a buyer's market </H2>

<A HREF="#survival">THE HIGH COST OF SURVIVAL</A><BR>
<A HREF="#search">THE SEARCH FOR INNOVATION</A> </H4>
<H2>

<A NAME="hangover"></A>When will the hangover end? </H2>
<H4>Despite a pent-up demand for capital, the outlook for Latin American
equity issuers is not promising. Companies' share prices remain depressed
and investors - who have learned to look more closely at the prevailing
political and economic climate - need further convincing. David Pilling
looks at whether a number of key privatizations can revive Latin America's
equity markets </H4>
Anyone who claims he can accurately predict the amount of capital Latin
America will raise through international equity placements next year will
also be able to determine the exact &quot;length of a piece of string blowing
in the wind&quot;, says Armen Kouyoumdjian, a Chilean-based analyst with
Mexican brokers Interacciones. Estimates are near meaningless, he adds,
given the daunting array of unpredictable variables, including the political
situation in Mexico, the direction of US interest rates and the success
of Brazil's nascent privatization programme. <BR>
<BR>
Crystal ball gazing is not an exact science admits Michael Atkin, director
of the Latin American department at the International Institute of Finance
(IIF), a Washington-based research group funded by US banks. Nevertheless,
the IIF predicts that next year net equity flows to Latin America will increase
to $21.7 billion from an estimated $17 billion this year. This would still
be well below the $28 billion tapped in 1994 and the $30 billion raised
in 1993, the years when confidence was high and privatization programmes
were in full swing. That Latin American companies may be able to tap the
equity markets to even this extent has surprised many analysts, given the
depth of negative sentiment earlier this year. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are pleasantly surprised by the recovery that we foresee in 1996,&quot;
says Atkin. He believes that in spite of the tremors sent through the continent
by Mexico's clumsy devaluation in early 1995, the region as a whole -
with the possible exception of Argentina and Mexico itself - looks
as economically solid, if not more solid, than before. &quot;The overall
story in the region is one of progress. Brazil is looking stronger than
it did 18 months ago. Chile is doing very well, Colombia is doing well,
Peru is doing well. And capital flows will respond accordingly,&quot; he
says. <BR>
<BR>
However, the IIF's 1996 prediction is not as clear-cut as that. Equity-related
inflows comprise not only portfolio investments, international offerings
and privatizations but also foreign direct investment (FDI). This last category
will account for a good deal of next year's net capital transfers, according
to Atkin, with Mexico alone expected to attract about $8 billion in FDI.
<BR>
<BR>
Argentina is a good example of what went on for much of 1995 and what may,
to some extent, be the pattern of 1996. Worries over the sustainability
of Argentina's currency board and fixed exchange rate, plus subsequent concern
over political wrangling within the governing Peronist party and the future
of economy minister Domingo Cavallo, caused portfolio investors to stay
away in droves. Nonetheless, direct flows continued unabated, as multinationals
in the auto, hydrocarbon and manufacturing sectors bet on Argentina's long-term
economic progress. <BR>
<BR>
The situation is mirrored throughout the continent where there was a &quot;big
fall-off&quot; in portfolio investment followed by &quot;not a whole lot
of recovery&quot;, according to Atkin. Latin American stock markets in the
main are small and shallow and &quot;their ability to absorb large amounts
of funds is limited. Mexico's exchange, one of the relatively big exchanges,
has taken a battering, which tends to drag down the others,&quot; Atkin
adds. <BR>
<BR>
A quick glance at the region's exchanges reveals how tough times have been.
By mid-November all the major bourses had lost ground, with Mexico down
32.5% on the previous year, and Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru
all showing losses. Only Venezuela, which had the advantage of reaching
basket-case status in 1994, bounced back this year - but only when
gains are calculated using the questionable official exchange rate. Small
wonder then that what was a flood of new ADR issues and secondary equity
offerings in 1993 and 1994 has slowed to a trickle this year. <BR>
<BR>
There are signs nevertheless that companies are again gingerly dipping into
the international equity markets, following a number of ADR listings by
Brazilian and Chilean companies in the second half of 1995. In the months
that followed the Mexican debacle, many companies that had nurtured hopes
of raising capital through a primary or secondary placement, quietly dropped
their plans and concentrated on surviving. Those that needed cash quickly
raised it through syndicated loans and the odd bond placement - often
collateralized with export earnings. But by mid-1995, equity placements
became possible for a few booming Brazilian retail stores - thanks
to pent-up consumer demand released by the country's price stabilization.
<BR>
<BR>
Brazilian wholesaler Makro was the first of the year with a $102 million
issue led by SBC Warburg. Funds were used to modernize existing stores and
to build eight new ones. Makro was followed by issues from retail outlet
Pao de Acucar with a $112 million IPO (initial public offering) underwritten
by Merrill Lynch, and another from Lojas Arapua - also a retail chain
- which raised R80 million ($83 million). Arapua's IPO was coordinated
by Brazilian banks Icatu, Patrimonio, Bradesco and Fenicia. Other retail
groups, including supermarket chain Bompreco, are also considering international
flotations in the coming months to finance expansion while Brazil's consumer
boom lasts. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The market continues to be receptive to the Brazilian story because
of its stabilization and tremendous growth,&quot; says an analyst at JP
Morgan. But such are the difficult international conditions for Latin American
companies - all to some extent tarred with the same Mexican brush -
that even an exceptional story like that of Brazilian retailers is not easy
to sell. Laurie Higgitt, managing director of Steven Rose and Partners,
a broker specializing in Brazilian and Argentine securities, says the Brazilian
issues were &quot;not an unqualified success&quot; being &quot;placed at
the bottom-to-middle end of the price range. The market is still under a
cloud.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A handful of issues from other countries were also placed - though
some of these were discounted or fell in price shortly after completion.
Gone are the days when companies merely had to hint at an ADR issue for
their share price to leap. Nevertheless, the Chilean supermarket chain Santa
Isabel raised $95.4 million through an ADR placement in June, and other
Chilean issues from Banco Osorno, energy holding company Enersis, and sugar
producer Iansa followed. Meanwhile, Banco Industrial Colombiano, the sixth
largest Colombian bank by assets, launched an international IPO of $50 million,
underwritten by JP Morgan, thus becoming only the second Colombian company
to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. <BR>
<BR>
Many analysts expect companies encouraged by such placements to be lining
up in 1996. &quot;What you have is a significant amount of pent-up demand,&quot;
says Nicolas Carlisle, vice president of JP Morgan in Buenos Aires. &quot;A
lot of Latin American companies have put some of their plans on hold because
they were unable to access the capital markets at all in 1995.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The requirements for financing are very high,&quot; agrees Juan Carlos
Garcia, head of Latin American research at Santander Investment. &quot;Many
companies in Latin America will be eager to bring deals to market because
this year has been more or less lost,&quot; he says. &quot;The real question
though is not whether companies want to raise capital, but are they going
to be able to? It is going to be very difficult for most companies to come
to the market until the second half of next year.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Garcia believes that, before Latin American issuers can be confident of
a decent reception, &quot;we need to see stability in Mexico. I don't care
if the peso goes to 10 [against the dollar], but it has to stabilize so
the investor can say: 'Now I understand the conditions'.&quot; Garcia's
assessment is not good news for countries and companies that have been trying
desperately to distance themselves from Mexico's travails. But the upside,
he says, is that &quot;as soon as Mexico stabilizes, investment will pick
up&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Even when investors are again prepared to subscribe to equity issues, they
are not likely to do so with the same naive abandon as before. &quot;It
is now a buyers' market,&quot; says one broker. Furthermore, the buyer will
be using different criteria than in the pre-Mexican crisis days. &quot;We've
noticed some change in the kinds of questions we get asked by clients,&quot;
says Atkin. &quot;There will be a lot more attention paid to macroeconomic
considerations. A lot of investors who bought an individual company story
were wiped out by macroeconomic disturbances.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In a note on Latin American equity strategy entitled &quot;Top Down/Bottom
Up&quot;, Garcia writes: &quot;Post Mexican devaluation, foreign sentiment
has changed: investors who were becoming more bottom-up-oriented (sectoral-
and company-driven) reverted to a top-down style, where economics and politics
prevailed.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
For example, the &quot;experience of Mexico has convinced people that exchange-rate
issues are very important and that you cannot always assume that what has
prevailed in the past will prevail in the future&quot;, says Atkin. Investors
are also particularly sensitive to &quot;political noise&quot; - of
the sort that so upset Argentine markets in the third quarter of 1995 -
and to the health of banking systems. National elections, debt levels, growth
prospects and interest-rate policy are all likely to play a greater role
in investors' calculations. Good companies in weak countries will probably
suffer. <BR>
<BR>
As well as examining the economic and political framework in which companies
operate, potential issuers are also going to find analysts scrutinizing
them far more closely than before. &quot;People are looking at much more
serious stress tests,&quot; says Atkin. &quot;They are concerned that companies
should be resilient to possible economic shocks and are looking at issues
like exposure to local interest rates, diversification of markets, and balance-sheet
strategies with respect to exchange-rate shocks.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Such strict examination, plus the inherent cost of launching an international
equity placement, may be enough to put off some issuers. &quot;Equity issues
can be a flop and a very public flop at that,&quot; says Kouyoumdjian. &quot;Rather
than mounting a road show and convincing all and sundry of the value of
one's company, it is often easier to sweet-talk a few banks into a syndicated
loan,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
Garcia says investors, who now have the ability to pick and choose, must
&quot;understand that one of the most important issues when looking at Latin
America is liquidity. Illiquid stocks are not much good if you want to get
out in a hurry&quot;. He also believes that equity analysts should pay closer
attention to an obvious but often neglected issue: &quot;whether the company
is going to survive and whether it can pay its debts&quot;. Many analysts
argue that blue-chip stocks with ADRs are unlikely to go under and that
the real issue is profits growth. But Garcia insists: &quot;Even if you're
an equity analyst - in fact, especially if you're an equity analyst
- your first question should be: will the company survive? Because
if it doesn't, you will be the last to be paid.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Given that successful equity placements are likely to be relatively rare,
issuers will need &quot;excellent stories&quot;, says Garcia. &quot;They
will either be monopolies or they will have a unique product or an important
competitive advantage. These are the companies that will tap the international
markets.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In the case of Mexican companies, those with &quot;significant export earnings&quot;
are likely to be the most successful issuers, according to Larry Goodman,
Latin American strategist at Salomon Brothers in New York. Such companies
are not only well placed to take advantage of Mexico's newly competitive
exchange rate, but also have a natural hedge against exchange-rate fluctuations.
<BR>
<BR>
Potential issuers, as well as being scrutinized by investors as never before,
may also be dissuaded from going to market by the depressed nature of their
share price. Solid companies in Argentina or Brazil trading at only seven
times earnings may well decide that now is not the best time to go to the
equity markets. Better to bide their time or try a debt issue. Conversely,
investors - many of whom are &quot;looking for big winners in order
to offset earlier losses&quot; - are unlikely to be overly interested
in defensive stocks, says Kouyoumdjian. In this respect, Chile and Peru
both look expensive. &quot;Why should I pay 22 times (earnings) for Santa
Isabel, when I can buy a similar stock in Buenos Aires at four times.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
If the recovery in international equity issues is likely to be only gradual,
analysts are more hopeful about the prospects for privatization in 1996.
Biggest of all, and potentially the key event in Latin American equity issues
next year, is the proposed sale of 51% of Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD),
Brazil's huge natural resources group. The privatization, which could raise
up to $5.5 billion, would be the largest in Latin America's history, outstripping
even that of YPF, the Argentine oil and gas group sold off in 1993. &quot;CVRD
is the flagship issue of 1996,&quot; says Atkin. <BR>
<BR>
But the sale of the conglomerate, the world's biggest iron ore producer,
raises several problems, any one of which could postpone the whole process.
It has not yet been decided for example, whether CVRD should be sold in
its entirety or split into separate divisions comprising iron, gold, steel
and forestry. Many Brazilians think that the conglomerate, which ploughs
back part of its profits into social programmes, should remain a single
entity. If it is split up, they fear it will lose its developmental role.
On the other hand, if Brazil insists that a private operator maintains the
company's social role, then the sale is bound to be made at a discount.
<BR>
<BR>
Neither is it clear whether the privatization would be undertaken in one
fell swoop. It may be difficult for international markets, still cautious
after Mexico, to absorb a single issue of such proportions. Staggering the
issue over two or more tranches seems more likely. Furthermore, Brazil will
have to decide whether it favours a trade sale or prefers to float the company
among institutional investors. If it is sold to a myriad of institutions,
CVRD could lose the managerial coherence that makes it one of the best-run
companies in Latin America. &quot;A jewel&quot; is the description used
by one analyst. Conversely, a sale to a single foreign firm might prove
an unacceptable blow to Brazil's national pride. <BR>
<BR>
Some analysts say the CVRD sale &quot;is the key equity deal of 1996&quot;.
But others are keen to dampen what they see as unrealistic expectations.
Higgitt doubts whether the privatization will go ahead at all next year.
He is more optimistic about the sale of Rio de Janeiro power company Light
in early 1996, which could raise $2.5 billion. Before Light can be privatized,
it will need to be split into two companies to separate out its 47% stake
in Sao Paulo power company Eletropaulo, as well as the debt owed to it by
Eletropaulo. <BR>
<BR>
Next year may also see the sale of Brazil's huge ports, railroads and some
banks. The privatization of Light and CVRD will prepare the ground for the
sale of electricity company Eletrobras, and eventually, telephone company
Telebras. Such is the excitement being generated by Brazil's privatization
process that many security houses - including Bear Stearns, Kleinwort
Benson, Lehman Brothers, Oppenheimer and Goldman Sachs - have opened
new offices in Sao Paulo. But Garcia predicts that Brazil's privatization
process will go ahead far more slowly than some hope. It will continue to
be on a &quot;case by case basis&quot;, dogged by political wrangling. <BR>
<BR>
Given investors' generally negative sentiment about Venezuela, there is
surprising interest in its privatization plans - through which it hopes
to raise $6 billion in 1996 and 1997. First on the block will be heavy industries
holding company Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) which comprises
aluminium groups Venalum and Alcasa, bauxite company Bauxilum, iron and
steel business Sidor, carbon company Carbonorca, ferrosilicon group Fesilven
and the gold enterprises Minerven and Minorca. According to Santander Investment:
&quot;Assuming economic progress, the privatization process may spread to
other sectors and produce a considerable amount of government revenue.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Peru also has a fair amount left to sell. &quot;They have already opened
their economy, but the biggest sectors are not yet privatized,&quot; says
Garcia. &quot;Once it sells PetroPeru and the fishing industry - the
largest in the world - they will increase liquidity and excite more
clients.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
According to a report by ING Barings, sales of PetroPeru, state mining concern
Centromin and the remaining government stake in Telefonica could raise more
than $4 billion next year. &quot;Privatization has been the key to the revival
of capital inflows (to Peru), as it has been a major source of funds in
its own right, as well as a catalyst to further direct investment,&quot;
says the report. <BR>
<BR>
Bolivia is also expected to privatize several assets in 1996. Its so-called
&quot;capitalization&quot; programme got off to a strong start this year
with the $610 million sale of 50% of long-distance/international telecoms
company Entel to STET of Italy. Of particular interest is oil company Yacimientos
Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB). But notwithstanding investors'
admiration for Bolivia's &quot;aggressive liberalization process&quot;,
it remains by Latin American standards &quot;a small, exotic market&quot;
according to one analyst. &quot;Bolivia is interesting and things are happening,&quot;
says Atkin. &quot;But it's not on the same scale - we're not looking
for big, dramatic transactions.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Argentina and Mexico will also continue to sell off assets, but neither
is offering anything likely to create much excitement. In November, Argentina
demonstrated that its privatization process was not completely dead with
the sale for $357 million of a petrochemical complex to a consortium of
Dow Chemical and YPF. But all that is left now are minority stakes in previously
privatized electricity companies and the controversial sales of three nuclear
plants and two hydroelectric dams. To sell the latter, Argentina will have
to overcome opposition from Paraguay and Uruguay, with whom the dams are
jointly-owned. <BR>
<BR>
Mexico is to sell railways, ports and 61 petrochemical plants belonging
to Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex). The latter is expected to raise $1.5 billion.
However, Mexico will continue to ban foreign investment in the oil industry
itself. <BR>
<BR>
Investors will have no shortage of privatization options in 1996 but the
level of activity should be put in perspective. &quot;The real surge in
privatization revenue came in the early 1990s and then tailed off pretty
rapidly,&quot; says Atkin. Apart from Brazil, where progress may be less
dramatic than many expect, &quot;there are no more YPFs left&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
For Latin American equity markets, next year is likely to be a far cry from
the heydays of the early 1990s. &quot;Investors are very cautious. On the
one hand Latin American funds are not prudent by nature. They're not for
the widow and orphan,&quot; says Kouyoumdjian. But on the other hand, investors
- many of them burned in the Mexican conflagration - &quot;are
worried they are going to lose their shirt again. They are inhibited by
not wanting to get it wrong. The last thing they want to do is throw good
money after bad,&quot; notes Kouyoumdjian. <BR>

<H4>A year after Mexican devaluation triggered near-meltdown of the Latin
American debt market, the region is again issuing bonds abroad. But access
is severely curtailed, available funding has shrunk and investors demand
much higher spreads. Norman Peagam examines the prospects </H4>
After a wrenching year for Latin American borrowers, issuing activity should
pick up in 1996, especially if interest rates stay low in the US, Europe
and Japan, according to bankers surveying the wreckage of last December's
Mexican crisis. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm moderately optimistic that the noise level will die down [in the
New Year],&quot; says Hugo Verdegaal, managing director and head of the
Cross-Border Finance Group at Citibank. &quot;I expect a positive year,
not an easy year, but a good year in which there will be more liquidity
available based on a more tranquil economic and political environment and
the strong economic growth opportunities in Latin America.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Despite this year's difficult conditions, there have been notable advances,
including several jumbo sovereign issues in the yen and Deutschmark sectors,
increased use of the US commercial paper market and penetration of the US
private placement market. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, Chile has continued to demonstrate its superior fundamentals,
enabling its leading companies to obtain financing on increasingly favourable
terms. This year, Compania de Telefonos de Chile borrowed $275 million for
five years at Libor plus 85 basis points (bp) while electricity producer
Endesa privately placed a $170 million fixed-rate 10-year bullet note issue
at 110bp over US treasuries, for an all-in cost of 7.25%. <BR>
<BR>
Fuelled by sliding US interest rates, Latin American bond issues climbed
to a record $27.4 billion in 1993 from $12.6 billion in 1992 and $7.2 billion
in 1991, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But the market
experienced prolonged turbulence the following year due to sharply rising
US rates and regional instability. Then, on December 20 1994, Mexico suddenly
abandoned its longstanding policy of maintaining a predictable exchange
rate, which had induced foreign investors to buy large amounts of peso-denominated
government debt, and devalued its currency. <BR>
<BR>
Investors reacted with outrage. Capital flight quickly consumed most of
the country's foreign reserves and Mexico faced the imminent prospect of
defaulting on its external debt, thereby destroying the confidence of investors
which it had worked hard to cultivate during the previous five years. <BR>
<BR>
Mexico was rescued from this fate by a US-organized $52 billion emergency
aid package, which has allowed the country to repay $41 billion of maturing
obligations this year. But the loss of confidence and stiff conditions attached
to the bailout have contributed to a deep recession, falling living standards
and rising unemployment. The Mexican peso's value has collapsed from 3.45
to the dollar a year ago to 7.9 recently (greatly boosting exports, the
only bright spot in an otherwise grim picture), while foreign reserves remain
close to zero, if liabilities to the US and the IMF are deducted. Moreover,
the crisis had a ripple effect on confidence elsewhere in the region, especially
Argentina, causing a further flight of capital. <BR>
<BR>
The short-term debt markets bore the initial brunt of the crisis, borrowers
being unable to roll over maturing debt as it came due. Mexican banks are
thought to have issued between $5.5 billion and $8 billion of certificates
of deposit abroad in recent years, for example, while Mexican private and
public companies had tapped the Eurocommercial paper market for perhaps
$3 billion (including about $2.5 billion to the public sector). Many of
these unsecured facilities are no longer available. &quot;There was a tremendous
impact on the short-term market,&quot; one banker says. &quot;Volumes are
down substantially, even now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In contrast, Latin American participation in the US commercial paper market
has actually expanded. This is because these one-year renewable programmes
are backed by letters of credit from major international banks; investors
and rating agencies rely solely on the credit of the bank providing support
(known as the fronting bank) which typically syndicates the risk among other
major banks. In return, the issuer pays a hefty risk-participation fee to
the syndicate members on top of its basic cost of funds. As of last month,
a select group of 18 Latin American borrowers had established programmes
totalling $3.2 billion. <BR>
<BR>
For Mexican issuers, the cost has increased substantially since the crisis,
with fees more than doubling in some cases, and covenants in some Mexican
programmes have also been tightened. A $125 million programme for Multibanco
Comermex arranged by Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale was abandoned.
But most Latin American programmes have been renewed and expanded, and several
new ones have been established this year, according to Bank of America,
a leading arranger. Recent new arrivals include Banorte and Bancomer from
Mexico, [with Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior (Bancomext) also in the
market last month], Banco de Galicia from Argentina [soon to be joined by
Banco Rio de la Plata] and Banco Boavista from Brazil. <BR>
<BR>
The longer-term market for Latin American debt began this year in &quot;total
paralysis&quot;, one banker recalls. Bond prices slumped and yields soared
as volatility increased dramatically and liquidity vanished. New issues
could not be launched. However, sentiment began to improve in the spring
and there were several confidence-building transactions. <BR>
<BR>
In April, Citibank arranged a $1 billion three-year floating-rate note (FRN)
issue for the Republic of Argentina with a coupon of Libor plus 300bp. Placed
initially with banks, the notes can be used to capitalize an investor's
operations in Argentina and can be credited against Argentine taxes owing,
if interest or principal are not paid. In July, Citibank and Credit Suisse
organized a $1 billion two-year FRN issue for Mexico at Libor plus 537.5bp.
The sweetener in this case was the ability to redeem the notes at par in
order to acquire shares in a Mexican bank or a Mexican company being privatized.
Targeted at international banks, the offering was heavily over-subscribed.
<BR>
<BR>
It was followed by the first Latin American yankee bond issue of the year,
a $250 million 7.375% five-year bullet arranged by Merrill Lynch for Corporacion
Andina de Fomento (CAF), a regional development bank based in Caracas which
is owned by five Latin American governments. The notes were priced at 145bp
over US treasuries, reflecting CAF's supranational status and the fact that
it is one of the region's few investment-grade credits. Brought to the US
market at a difficult time, it &quot;showed that dollar demand was not dead&quot;,
a New York banker notes. <BR>
<BR>
The success of these placements opened the door for the resumption of new
issues. But, except for Brazilian banks, borrowing has been dominated by
a few sovereigns and well-known state enterprises. Not a single private-sector
Mexican company has been able or willing to issue straight public debt this
year - although cigarette maker Empresa La Moderna was hoping to launch
a $100 million three-year offering in late November - and only a handful
of other Latin American corporate names have done so. Nevertheless, when
viewed in the context of the recent crisis, Paul Tregidgo, director, capital
markets, at CS First Boston, describes this year's market as &quot;very
resilient, in terms of the volume, quality and diversity of issues. Last
January, a lot of people said the market was going to disappear, but it
clearly hasn't&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
According to preliminary CSFB estimates, the year-to-date volume of new
Latin American bond issues totalled about $14.6 billion in mid-November,
compared with $15.7 billion in all of 1994, excluding private placements.
But in breaking down these figures, the bank shows big changes in the pattern
of borrowing from previous years. Most significantly, US dollar issues accounted
for only 41% of the latest total (compared with around 85% in past years)
while yen and Deutschmark issues combined accounted for nearly 55% (compared
with 10% in the past). <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The US institutional sector took a major step back from the Latin
American markets this year, and is only now putting its toes back in the
water selectively,&quot; says Tregidgo. He attributes the increase in demand
among yen and Deutschmark investors to low Japanese and German interest
rates, the limited availability of high-yielding instruments in their domestic
markets and the dollar's recent weakness. <BR>
<BR>
High-yield Deutschmark and yen investors are mainly second-tier institutions
and retail accounts interested in buying and holding paper, rather than
trading. They prefer bonds issued by sovereign and public-sector names,
rather than unfamiliar corporations, with tenors of less than five years.
These preferences help to explain other trends uncovered by the CSFB data:
<BR>
<BR>
* the average maturity of Latin American issues this year fell sharply with
one- to three-year notes accounting for almost 70% of the total (35% in
1993) while seven- to 10-year notes accounted for only 5% (22% in 1993);
<BR>
<BR>
* public-sector borrowers represented two-thirds of total issuance this
year, compared with less than 50% last year. <BR>
<BR>
Since the Mexican crisis, investors seem to have drawn a clearer distinction
between credits. Chile and Colombia increasingly are regarded as being in
a class of their own, for example. Both are rated investment-grade by Moody's
and Standard &amp; Poor's and can borrow without undue difficulty (although
Chile discourages external borrowing and political developments in Colombia
make it unattractive to some investors). Last month, Colombia was even rumoured
to be considering a 20-year bond offering. <BR>
<BR>
In contrast, other major Latin American countries have been penalized since
the Mexican crisis, as shown by the secondary-market spreads between their
dollar-denominated Brady bonds and US treasury bonds. These spreads, which
represent the risk premiums demanded by investors, have widened dramatically
since December 1994. As of November 1995, the risk premium on Mexican Brady
bonds was 700-900bp higher than pre-crisis levels (depending on the instrument),
while it was 500-600bp higher for Argentina and 200-400bp higher for Brazil.
In absolute terms, the spread on Mexican Bradys was still the lowest of
the group by a small margin at the end of October, at 1,222bp over treasuries
(for the par bond), compared with 1,286bp for Brazil and 1,425bp for Argentina,
according to Salomon Brothers. <BR>
<BR>
While Mexico may have lost its pre-crisis status as the Latin American benchmark,
Brazil is increasingly being judged on its own merits. Latin America's largest
country has been relatively insulated from the effects of the Mexican devaluation
and its private-sector banks have continued to launch a steady stream of
small, short-term Eurobond issues this year (mostly recycling Brazilian
money) with spreads sometimes falling below the levels that comparable Mexican
and Argentine names could command. (Brazil sets a minimum maturity of one
year for refinancings and two years for new issues. It also recently imposed
a tax on the proceeds of foreign bond issues with a maturity of less than
eight years. Hoping to get around this rule, or at least defer the tax payment,
some Brazilian borrowers have begun issuing eight-year bonds with two-year
put or call options.) <BR>
<BR>
At the other extreme, Venezuela continues to be shunned by most portfolio
investors, appalled at the country's political and economic disarray and
mismanagement - the spread on Venezuela's par bonds was recently more
than 1,900bp. In September, official statistics showed that the government
had paid only 56% of the $4.3 billion in foreign debt service due this year;
reportedly it was asking official creditors to reschedule some of their
debt and was hoping to cover other payments with the proceeds from Eurobond
issues. Venezuela last month successfully placed a Dm500 million three-year
note issue through Commerzbank, priced at 559bp over German government bonds,
with investors presumably taking comfort from the $14 billion Venezuela
earns per year in oil revenues. <BR>
<BR>
Several other Latin American sovereigns tapped the Deutschmark sector this
year. Brazil raised Dm1 billion for three years at 385bp; Mexico borrowed
Dm1 billion for five years at 407bp and Argentina obtained Dm1 billion for
five years at 344bp and a further Dm750 million for seven years at 438bp.
Some bankers thought the groundbreaking seven-year tenor would be too long
for retail Deutschmark investors but the bonds placed steadily and the issue
size was increased from Dm500 million. Uruguay also borrowed Dm200 million
for five years at 236bp and in late November Colombia raised Dm150 million
(Dm200 million was planned) for five years at 200bp - above the forecast
165bp. <BR>
<BR>
Sovereigns and large state enterprises were the only Latin American borrowers
able to gain access to the Euroyen market this year, apart from the investment-grade
supranationals CAF and Banco Latinoamericano de Exportaciones (Bladex),
a Panama-based institution owned by Latin America's central banks and others.
These borrowers took advantage of the opening, despite the fact that several
of them have lost their swap lines since the Mexican crisis and were stuck
with the yen proceeds. Brazil raised &#165;80 billion for two years at 6.0%.
Mexico issued &#165;100 billion for three years at 5.0%, &#165;30 billion
due March 1997 at 2.85% and &#165;13 billion for two years at 3%. Argentina
obtained &#165;100 billion for five years at 5.5% and a further &#165;45
billion for 3.3 years at 5.0%. Colombia launched the only Latin American
samurai of the year, placing &#165;12 billion in Japan for seven years at
4.1%. It was the first Latin seven-year issue in yen for well over a decade
and, despite pre-launch underwriter nervousness, was described as a blowout.
<BR>
<BR>
The big Brazilian oil and electricity companies mounted Euroyen offerings
on the same day in October. Petrobras placed &#165;15 billion of three-year
notes at 5.375% (scaled back from &#165;30 billion), while Eletrobras placed
&#165;10 billion of three-year notes with a two-year put at 5.2%. Bladex
launched Latin America's first dual-currency Euroyen offering, a &#165;10
billion one-year issue at 5%, repayable in dollars at a pre-set exchange
rate, arranged by Nikko Securities. Technically, this was also the first
public offering in Japan by any foreign commercial bank, since it was registered
with the Japanese authorities. <BR>
<BR>
Sovereigns were largely absent from the dollar sector of the market, other
than special redeemable issues placed with international banks by Argentina
and Mexico, until a $1.5 billion one-year dollar/peso dual currency bond
from Mexico in late November. Apart from Brazilian bank paper and a couple
of other Brazilian and Colombian issues, the main public offerings were
from three blue-chip companies in Argentina. MetroGas launched a $120 million
five-year offering at 550bp over US treasuries; Telecom Argentina raised
$200 million for seven years at 625bp (to the four-year put option) and
Banco de Galicia borrowed $50 million for two years at 525bp. The Telecom
transaction was the third, and probably last, Latin American yankee bond
issue of the year (following one by CAF and a structured financing by Argentine
oil and gas company YPF) and reportedly was difficult to place. At the launch,
a previous five-year Telecom issue was trading at 660bp, offering investors
a more attractive alternative (while the YPF four-year average life structured
yankee, launched the previous week, was priced at only 200bp). <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Basically, the investor base has shrunk,&quot; says Mark Hall, vice-president,
Latin America Capital Markets, at JP Morgan, referring to the all-important
dollar sector of the market. &quot;You're left with a hard core of dedicated
funds and dedicated Latin American investors. A lot of the investor money
has pulled out and a lot of the corporate money has pulled out; they've
taken the money and realigned their portfolios to exclude Latin America.&quot;
Another banker says that more sophisticated investors &quot;have come to
accept Brady bonds as the vehicle for their investment in the region, because
of their yield and liquidity, so Eurobonds are now mainly limited to retail
markets, [non-US dollar] currency markets and short-maturity instruments&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
Brady bonds also influence the new-issue Eurobond market in another way.
&quot;The biggest problem is that Brady bonds set such an unacceptable benchmark
for so many of these borrowers,&quot; remarks Victor Maruri, head of Latin
America investment banking at Paribas Capital Markets. &quot;It's difficult
to issue long-term Eurobonds when investors can buy comparable duration
Bradys with yields of over 1,000bp and an impressive degree of liquidity.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
In an effort to get around this and other obstacles, some Latin American
borrowers have turned to the US private placement market this year, either
on a stand-alone basis or, for the first time, with the backing of the International
Finance Corporation (IFC). In addition, there has been a jump in bond issues
backed by receivables arranged on a quasi-private placement basis this year,
in which debt service payments typically are derived from a predictable
stream of export revenues. Tapping another pocket of demand, JP Morgan and
Merrill Lynch in September organized the first Latin American convertible
bond issue since the Mexican crisis, a $130 million five-year 8% placement
sold at par with a 20% conversion premium for the Mexican company Alfa.
<BR>
<BR>
For the moment, the need for long-term funding by Latin American companies
may have been reduced by the economic slowdown in much of the region. Companies
are reluctant to issue debt under present conditions, preferring to wait
for better terms. But John Hartzell, vice-president for emerging markets
corporate debt research at Salomon Brothers, predicts a large and growing
demand for debt capital, fuelled by capital spending requirements put on
hold this year, a rising tide of maturing Eurobonds issued in recent years
(which will need to be refinanced) and low stock market values which make
equity capital an unattractive alternative. (In late 1994, the IMF estimated
that maturing bonds issued by borrowers in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico
will amount to about $7.7 billion next year, $6.2 billion in 1997 and peak
at $9.4 billion in 1998.) <BR>
<BR>
Hartzell also points out, &quot;the devaluation has accelerated the need
for [Mexican] corporate financial management teams to restructure the terms
of their liabilities from short-term floating to longer-term fixed&quot;,
to avoid potential liquidity problems caused by an asset/liability mismatch.
So far, there have been only a few defaults, near-defaults and restructurings
on the large volume of Latin American debt issued abroad between 1989 and
1994. Going forward, says Hartzell, the best-positioned companies will be
those with sustainable export earnings, foreign assets, cash flow and strong
working capital. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The demand for capital is certainly going to be there,&quot; Hartzell
continues. &quot;What's uncertain is the volatility. If there's reduced
volatility and the fundamentals look okay, growing confidence could lead
to a lot of issuance.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Mark Hall says he thinks continued credit differentiation will benefit the
region's prime borrowers - &quot;a group of between five and 15 names
[in each country] that are considered top-tier, stable companies in well-known
international industries&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
This year's focus on non-dollar currencies and credit-enhanced deals is
likely to continue in early 1996, says Tregidgo, noting that the challenges
are to lengthen maturities, widen investor demand to private-sector issuers
and revive dollar-based investor interest. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;As long as there's a reasonable scenario on the political and economic
fronts, we'll continue to see what's been an encouraging performance by
the market in the second half of this year, with the same themes and a steady
return of the dollar sector,&quot; says Tregidgo. <BR>

<H2><A NAME="search"></A>The search for innovation </H2>
<H4>Latin American borrowers and their bankers, embattled by loss of investor
<BR>
confidence since the Mexican devaluation, have sought to develop innovative
<BR>
techniques raising capital abroad. </H4>
Most of the new techniques for raising money tried in Latin America are
based on structures designed to enhance the injured credit status of the
issuer, typically by securitizing offshore dollar receivables or by providing
support from a foreign official agency. <BR>
<BR>
According to JP Morgan, almost $3 billion of securitized transactions had
been completed for Latin America as of mid-November, or roughly triple the
volume in previous years. These are quasi-private placements, usually rated
investment-grade regardless of the borrower's home-country ceiling, which
provide issuers with longer tenors and lower funding costs than they could
achieve with plain-vanilla bond issues. Recent offerings have been backed
by future receivables, such as credit-card payments and future export receivables
based on the production and shipment of steel, iron ore pellets, aluminium,
pulp and paper, oil, orange juice and even automobile parts. <BR>
<BR>
Earlier this year, for example, Banco Nacional de Mexico (Banamex) raised
$206.5 million through a four-year note issue (with an average life of 2.5
years) at 300 bp over US treasuries, in a deal arranged by JP Morgan, by
securitizing its exclusive right to receive US dollar remittances sent to
Mexico from the US and Canada via First Data Corporation, the leading US
electronic money transfer firm. Total remittances range from an estimated
$2.2 billion to as high as $5 billion annually, and Mexico's largest bank
is thought to handle at least $1 billion of these payments through its far-flung
branch network, in effect providing vast implicit over-collateralization
for the note issue. <BR>
<BR>
The US market has long provided cheaper funds to below-single-A credits
compared with the Euromarket, in part reflecting its extra sophistication
in analyzing credit risk. One banker estimates current savings in the US
private-placement market for a conventional triple-B foreign credit at 90-100bp,
and the advantage seems to have widened for Latin borrowers since the Mexican
crisis. <BR>
<BR>
But these borrowers are often &quot;good companies located in bad zip [postal]
codes&quot;, as one US banker puts it, and must provide extra comfort to
investors, building structures that are &quot;bullet-proof to the explosion
of the company&quot;. These financings, which revolve around performance
and structure rather than underlying credit quality, tend to be complex,
difficult to construct and document, time-consuming and expensive. <BR>
<BR>
They are designed to minimize sovereign risk effects, usually by establishing
an offshore trust account through which all export revenues flow and where
a certain amount of money is kept on reserve to meet unforeseen contingencies.
The amount of reserves varies with each deal; one banker says it commonly
ranges from six months' interest to six months' debt service. The notes
are amortizing (principal is repaid in instalments, often on a monthly basis),
reflecting that the structure revolves around cash flow and that investors
want to receive the revenues as they come in. <BR>
<BR>
Since these transactions are driven by export revenues, only Latin America's
big exporters can access the market. Mexican companies have been the most
active issuers to date, reflecting Mexico's export-oriented economy, but
borrowers from other parts of the region are expected to make greater use
of the technique in future, including Peruvian and Colombian companies.
There are two types of investor: the traditional US private placement universe,
consisting principally of insurance companies, and international (mainly
European) banks, which are prepared to invest in Latin American paper without
currency risk - when they can obtain waivers from their home central
banks so they do not have to set aside reserves to cover possible losses
on the investment. <BR>
<BR>
Seeking to reduce costs and compete for this growing business, leading banks
have been working on what one spokesman calls &quot;new levels of asset-backed
technology&quot;. For example, in another JP Morgan deal, the Colombian
subsidiary of US oil and gas producer Triton Energy issued $125 million
of five-year notes with two years' grace and a 3.8-year average life at
220bp over treasuries by securitizing crude-oil export revenues. But, in
this case, the transaction was structured as a forward sale of crude rather
than a securitization of future receivables, which was &quot;slightly more
beneficial for the company from a tax and accounting point of view and more
favourable legally for investors&quot;, says Dominique Lemaire, vice-president,
securitized finance, for JP Morgan. <BR>
<BR>
Recently, CS First Boston even brought a structured financing to the public
yankee bond market, on behalf of YPF, the Argentine oil and gas developer,
with the company issuing the notes directly to investors rather than using
a special-purpose offshore trust as the legal borrower. Through CSFB, YPF
has raised $800 million this year in two securitizations: one private placement
of $400 million for five years (average) at 250bp and the public offering
of $400 million for four years (average) at 200bp, illustrating the fact
that even Latin America's top companies are obliged to use securitization
to achieve their financing targets. (YPF is Argentina's largest company,
accounting for 1.5% of the country's GDP and 25% of its stock-market capitalization,
but its credit rating on conventional debt is constrained by Argentina's
relatively low country ceiling.) <BR>
<BR>
Both the YPF issues are backed by a long-term contract under which it exports
oil from Argentina by underground pipeline across the Andes to Chile's state-owned
oil company. The notes were rated investment-grade, allowing the first issue
to be placed with US insurance companies and most of the yankee issue to
be placed with high-grade US corporate buyers. The rating was based on the
strength of the two companies, the receivables to be generated under the
mutually-beneficial contract, a three months' debt service reserve in an
offshore collection account, over-collateralization and an oil-price hedge
(provided by JP Morgan in the first deal and CS Financial Products in the
second). <BR>
<BR>
One recent change is that rating agencies and investors are now willing
to look at securitizations that do not revolve around specific export contracts
but depend on cash flow generation and the borrower's track record, providing
the export commodity can be sold easily in a spot market. The additional
risk is addressed by heavy over-collateralization, sometimes involving as
much as four or five times the amount of debt service, as well as various
covenants and payment accelerators. Foreign parents and major banks have
also begun to offer themselves as export buyers of last resort. Alcoa of
Brazil recently issued $190 million of five-year (average) notes at 180bp,
compared with 250bp in a similar transaction last year, in a deal arranged
by Citibank which is backed by an assurance from the company's foreign parent
that it will continue to export aluminium. <BR>
<BR>
In the latest wrinkle, Chemical Bank has arranged a two-tranche financing
of more than $100 million for a Brazilian exporter of agricultural products,
using a sovereign indemnity provided by the issuer's foreign parent-company
to eliminate political risk during the five and seven years' average life
of the notes. As a result, the offering obtained an investment-grade rating
and achieved probably the finest terms yet in one of these deals, a spread
&quot;in the 150-ish basis point range&quot;, according to Ron Keenan, head
of the global private placement group at Chemical, even though the transaction
does not use an offshore trust account or reserves. &quot;The market demands
a substantial premium for traditional asset-backed debt,&quot; he says.
&quot;With these new structures, we can reduce that by 100bp or so.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
A few select Latin American borrowers have obtained medium- or long-term
financing on extremely advantageous terms by enlisting the explicit backing
of a foreign government or official agency. For example, the US Export-Import
Bank provides loan guarantees where the borrowed funds are used to buy US
goods and services. In one recent transaction, Venezuela's state-owned oil
company, Petroleos de Venezuela, borrowed about $145 million for nine years
(4.6 years average) for just 40bp over US treasuries, because the US Eximbank
guarantees timely payment of 100% of the interest and principal, eliminating
all country risk. <BR>
<BR>
Other companies have been able to obtain support from the International
Finance Corporation (IFC), which has arranged bank loans and equity investments
for its clients. This year, it has broadened its activities to include a
form of securitization. In July, the IFC unveiled an innovative co-financing
structure which aims to tap into the huge US private placement market, dominated
by institutional investors with a taste for long-term, investment- grade,
fixed-income securities. <BR>
<BR>
The IFC agreed to lend $100 million for 12 years at 9% a year (315bp over
US treasuries) to Apasco, a Mexican cement company which is 55%-owned by
Holderbank of Switzerland. The IFC provided $15 million directly to Apasco
and transferred its interest in the remainder to a Delaware trust which
raised the funds by issuing $80 million of 12-year 9% certificates to four
US life insurance companies and $5 million of certificates to the IFC, using
Swiss Bank Corporation and Banamex as placement agents. <BR>
<BR>
The securities were rated investment-grade. In addition, the investors can
take comfort from the fact that the IFC, which is considered a preferred
creditor that is virtually immune from default, remains the lender of record
for the entire $100 million loan to Apasco (although its participation does
not in itself ensure timely debt service). For its part, the borrower was
able to obtain unusually long-term financing at relatively low cost. The
IFC hopes this mechanism will become an important new source of long-term
funding for its clients in developing countries and last month was believed
to be working on similar deals for Bimbo, a Mexican bakery company, and
Bridas, an Argentine oil and gas company. <BR>

<H2>Pay row flares again as ING slams Deutsche's 'poaching' </H2>
<h4>
DEUTSCHE MORGAN Grenfell found itself at the eye of the storm again this
week as its recruitment of a 44-strong Latin American equity team from ING
Barings drew a furious response from its Dutch rival.
</h4>
ING Barings' chief executive Hessel Lindenbergh said his bank had made
a formal complaint to Deutsche Bank chairman Hilmar Kopper about &quot;poaching&quot;
competitors' staff -- especially in teams -- and bidding up pay in the investment
banking industry to ridiculous levels. <BR>
<BR>
It is the second time that a rival has turned on Deutsche Morgan Grenfell,
which has taken an aggressive stance towards hiring in its drive to develop
a full-service <BR>
global investment bank. <BR>
<BR>
Shortly before its takeover by SBC, SG Warburg directors publicly accused
Deutsche of &quot;targeting&quot; the bank in its effort to build up a global
equities operation. <BR>
<BR>
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell officials yesterday adopted a sanguine stance in
response to Lindenbergh's complaint, saying they would not be drawn into
a public war of words. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The suggestion from competitors that Deutsche Morgan Grenfell is somehow
disrupting the investment banking recruitment market is totally hypocritical,&quot;
said one insider. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are doing nothing different from what everyone else has been doing
for years and the notion that we are doubling people's salaries and guaranteeing
bonuses for two or three years is nonsense.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He added: &quot;As a rule, we do not offer guaranteed bonuses for longer
than one year and all pay is subject to performance. This firm has always
had a reputation for controlling costs and we are doing nothing that is
not standard in the industry.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Executives said the hiring of the ING Barings' Latin American equities team
had been initiated by the recruits themselves -- principally Jonathan Beatson-Hird,
who had left ING Barings shortly before the rest of his colleagues and who
becomes head of Latin American equities. <BR>
<BR>
Given the scale of ING Barings' anger after the recruitments were made public,
there was some surprise among rivals that the firm had not done more to
keep its staff after Beatson-Hird had left. <BR>
<BR>
Rick Haller, head of emerging markets at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said
the move would transform the firm from being a niche player in Latin American
equities to being an acknowledged leader in the field. <BR>
<BR>
The acquisition of a substantial equities capability would give the bank
a more diversified revenue base within its overall integrated investment
banking operation in the Latin American markets. <BR>
<BR>
While conceding that the loss of most of its Latin American equities team
would harm the bank's activities in the short term, ING Barings director
Peter Geraghty said the bank's commitment to the Latin American region was
unchanged. <BR>
<BR>
As a group, ING was known as a leader in all aspects of Latin American finance
and investment banking, he said, and that would not change. &quot;While
Latin America is very important to us, Latin American equities is a relatively
small piece of the jigsaw,&quot; he said. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This gives us an opportunity to rethink and rebuild and to develop
a new product group that is the best thing in the market.&quot;

<H3> <B>Le noeud de vip&egrave;res</B> </H3>
<H4> <B>Last month the second biggest bank in the world, Cr&eacute;dit Agricole, bought 53% of Banque
Indosuez for Ffr6.3 billion. In theory this is its first down-payment for a
passport to global investment banking. But don't hold your breath. Cr&eacute;dit
Agricole is a slow mover and Indosuez is not so much an investment bank, more a
nest of vipers. David Shirreff reports</B> </H4> 

<P> Ask Richard Sandor or Wendy de Monchaux whether they think Banque Indosuez is a useful addition to
Cr&eacute;dit Agricole's financial fire-power. Their answer might be a short
expletive.

<P> Both of them quit Indosuez after a brief, but initially successful, attempt
to turn the conservative <I>banque d'affaires</I> into an Anglo-Saxon-style
derivatives powerhouse.

<P> Jean-Claude Gruffat, at that time in charge of Indosuez in New York, hired
Sandor and de Monchaux in April 1990 from a defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert, where
they had just successfully unwound a $25 billion swap book.

<P> Their brief at Indosuez was to develop a derivatives trading operation to
expand the bank's client base and enhance profits. By the end of two years they
had done both, although Sandor quit after a year. Indosuez was regarded as
<I>the</I> French house in New York for derivatives and structured products, and
1992 trading profits soared to $90 million, according to former members of the
swap team. This was done without taking excessive risk. Sandor preferred
arbitrage to open-position trading. The team was also active in Paris, London and
Hong Kong.

<P> But within a year, things began to go wrong on the personal front. Indosuez
International Capital Markets, as the group was called, was on a 35% profit
share. As profits soared, the French bankers in Paris &#173; notably head of
capital markets<B> </B>Alain de Korsak &#173; began to think the investment
bankers were getting too much. They attempted to renegotiate the deal. Sandor
quit in early 1991 and de Korsak brought in Luxembourg-born Marc Schmitt from
Dresdner Bank as a replacement. De Monchaux refused to report to Schmitt and was
finally fired, according to a former colleague, in June 1993. When the bonuses on
1992 profits were announced in February 1993, "15 to 20 traders" were deeply
disappointed and walked out. Schmitt and Philippe Gautier &#173; brought in from
BNP Capital Markets &#173; soldiered on for two more years. Derivatives profits
in 1993 and 1994 were still respectable but the commitment from above, and
possibly the financial incentive, had gone. Indosuez's foray into front-line
financial engineering was in tatters. "We were victims of our own success," says
a former member of the Sandor team. Gautier left in May 1994, and Schmitt a year
later. Of the Indosuez swap alumni, Schmitt is at Merrill Lynch, Gautier at
brokers Prebon Yamane. De Monchaux took some of her team to Bear Stearns and
Sandor runs Centre Financial Products, an insurance derivatives joint venture.

<P> Gruffat recalls the decline of Indosuez's swaps operation as purely a
function of credit rating: "We went from AA down to A minus. But the downgrading
of our short-term debt by Standard &amp; Poor's to A2 was the real killer."

<P> <B>Downscaling</B>

<P> Since that episode, little has changed at Indosuez to suggest it is any more
committed to international capital markets. In fact, the key figure in Indosuez's
plans for expansion in this field, deputy chairman Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lepetit,
left the bank in January. Lepetit had supported Gruffat in New York, the Sandor
team and its profit share, but was outmanoeuvred by the man below him, de Korsak.
Last year he lost out in his bid, along with then Suez chairman G&eacute;rard
Worms, to combine Suez with the financial forces of BNP and UAP (Union des
Assurances de Paris). Worms was forced out in July 1995. But the last straw for
Lepetit came in January, when Indosuez, with the help of consultants McKinsey
&amp; Co, announced a downscaling of its global investment banking ambitions. "It
was the admission that we can't be everything to everyone," says an Indosuez
source. "Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois [Lepetit] always had an ambition that was perhaps
too big for our resources." Lepetit is now working as an adviser to BNP. Gruffat
(the closest Indosuez has to a senior investment banker) has been sent to the
vital outpost of south-east Asia.

<P> Competitors recognize that Indosuez has a historical franchise, but that
operationally it is only good in parts and is riven with internal jealousies. One
bank treasurer recalls visits from consecutive Indosuez bankers, each saying:
"Don't tell my colleague that I've been here." Indosuez is the bank the treasurer
would like his staff not to emulate.

<P> But the curbing of its ambitions may signal a change. Last month, Indosuez
confirmed that its strategy, approved by new majority shareholder Cr&eacute;dit
Agricole, was to concentrate on Europe and Asia. That includes developing "strong
capital markets activities in the Asian Pacific region as well as enhancing our
position in core corporate banking," said Christian Maurin, Lepetit's replacement
as CEO and now chairman. Maurin is a commercial banker, having headed Suez's
consumer finance and credit card subsidiary Banque Sofinco for 10 years. "He's
very French and very domestic," says a French bank analyst. "He's not a merchant
banker, he's a civil servant," says another. For Indosuez, a lot rides on the
ability of Gruffat to attract a new team of high-calibre people in Asia.

<P> "We've been hiring people for debt capital markets," says Gruffat, "mostly to
develop sales and trading in Asian currency bonds."

<P> "Indosuez has always had the ability to attract people," says a former
employee, "but it has lacked the ability to keep them." If it balks at high
incentives and profit-share mechanisms, it will find the job even more difficult.

<P> However, with its new parent, Cr&eacute;dit Agricole, Indosuez has a
significant new strength &#173; a better rating. Rating agencies won't yet give
it the AA+ rating of the mother bank, but IBCA, the London-based rating agency,
last month upgraded Indosuez's medium-term debt from A to AA-. That takes into
account the liquid resources likely to be available from the parent and the
bank's reduced cost of funding. It was the deteriorating credit rating of
Compagnie de Suez, Indosuez's former parent, after a downgrade from IBCA last
December, which finally forced the sale, according to Suez chairman G&eacute;rard
Mestrallet. Only last August he had said the bank was an integral part of the
Suez group and not for sale.

<P> But uncertainty about the bank's future and its main shareholder ate into
client confidence. "At meetings we'd spend the first half hour reassuring the
client that we'd still be around in a year's time," recalls an Indosuez
mandate-hunter. "It didn't help us win business. But that's all behind us now."

<P> "We're already feeling an improvement in our borrowing margins," says a
source at Indosuez's Hong Kong-based broker WI Carr. An improved rating also
makes a bank a more attractive workplace for dealers in derivatives and
off-balance-sheet products, because of the activity's sensitivity to credit.

<P> With these enhanced prospects, Indosuez may be steaming ahead in Asia, but
Europe is another matter. There is quite an overlap with Cr&eacute;dit Agricole
in capital markets and equity brokerage. In the worst case there will be a clash
of capital markets philosophy; while in corporate finance and the equity business
Indosuez is still weak at home. Indosuez sources recognize that Cr&eacute;dit
Agricole has some capital markets expertise, but whether it understands
investment banking is still an open question. "All I can say," says an Indosuez
source, "is that they have studied Banque Indosuez as a target for several years.
And they were well advised by Goldman Sachs. They went into this with their eyes
open."

<P> The Cr&eacute;dit Agricole group comprises a central Caisse Nationale de
Cr&eacute;dit Agricole (CNCA) serving 60 <I>caisses regionales</I>. It has 20% of
the French retail market. Its wholesale business has grown in response to the
needs of the <I>caisses regionales</I> and their huge exposure to interest rate
risk as takers of more deposits than they can lend. CNCA has made forays into the
corporate lending market, but its corporate lending unit, Unicredit, has been
described as a disaster. It has a successful operation in Hong Kong, doing trade
finance, and lending to small and medium-sized companies. But this is hardly a
base on which to build a global investment bank &#173; if that were to be its
aim.

<P> CNCA had an experience in the swap market similar to that of Indosuez. In
July 1990 it hired a team from Elders, which had successfully wound up the Elders
swap book after the parent got into financial difficulties. But again the capital
markets culture was not easily absorbed. The swap dealers had trouble getting
credit lines to expand their business, while they saw billions of francs of
exposure being written in traditional loans. According to analysts, in the late
1980s CNCA lost more than Ffr8 billion through aggressive capital markets
expansion. Since then CNCA has pulled in its horns but built up useful expertise
in its own asset and liability management. Even today, capital markets activity
at CNCA makes a small contribution to profits &#173; "perhaps 10% in a good
year," says a ratings analyst.

<P> "If you want to do something successful with Cr&eacute;dit Agricole," says a
former employee, "do it as a joint venture." Otherwise, he explains, "the
important day-to-day decisions never get made."

<P> One example of this is CNCA's 50:50 derivatives joint venture with the three
Lazard houses &#173; Cr&eacute;dit Agricole Lazard Financial Products (CALFP).
Based in London, CALFP uses the CNCA balance sheet and Lazard expertise to
construct high-margin deals usually in equity derivatives, mostly with Lazard's
top quality clients. The business is successful and profitable but probably adds
little to Cr&eacute;dit Agricole's in-house expertise.

<P> CNCA has a number of trading subsidiaries and joint ventures. The Banque de
Gestion Priv&eacute;e (BGP), with Ffr700 million ($140 million) in capital and
around Ffr10 billion in assets, specializes in asset management and proprietary
options trading through its 53% subsidiary Transbourse, on the German, Swiss and
French futures exchanges. The Banque de Financement et de Tr&eacute;sorerie (BFT)
does much the same but in short-term money markets. BGP takes little credit risk,
since it deals mostly in exchange-traded products, not over the counter. It
recently sold its leveraged buyout portfolio to CNCA. Insiders say the culture
clash already apparent between BGP and CNCA doesn't bode well for relations with
Indosuez.

<P> There are two other brokers, Dynabourse, the third biggest in Paris, with a
6.5% to 7% market share, and Hayaux du Tilly, a small retail broker. Dynabourse
employs 155 people and has a 100% subsidiary, CA Securities in New York, and an
office in Frankfurt. According to outsiders, a lot of its business is with
members of the Cr&eacute;dit Agricole group.

<P> These subsidiaries are run as separate fiefdoms. Their officers argue that as
long as they continue to make a profit there is little reason to integrate them.

<P> Cr&eacute;dit Agricole may treat Banque Indosuez in the same way &#173; for a
while. But once it has completed its consolidated credit and market risk analysis
&#173; it must report consolidated results and risk positions quarterly under the
EU's capital adequacy directive &#173; there will be clear arguments to integrate
some activities such as treasury and capital markets.

<P> McKinsey &amp; Co, which completed a study on Banque Indosuez in January, is
now doing one on the Cr&eacute;dit Agricole group. For the moment, Cr&eacute;dit
Agricole management itself does not appear to have a clear vision of where it
wants to take the group, judging by its reluctance to talk on the subject. Having
made the Indosuez acquisition, it is likely to carry on for a while as if nothing
had happened, analysts predict.

<P> <B>Stockbroker glut</B>

<P> Indosuez staff congratulate themselves that there appears to be so little
overlap with Cr&eacute;dit Agricole. In Asia, Indosuez's strong franchise in
equities, foreign exchange and corporate banking impinges little on Cr&eacute;dit
Agricole's business with small and medium-sized clients. In European commercial
banking it may be a different story. Both groups have corporate clients, although
those of Indosuez are more international, and both compete in the French capital
markets in trading and origination.

<P> Indosuez owns the biggest stockbroker in France, Cheuvreux de Virieu.
Although its clients are more international than those of Dynabourse and
Transbourse, there is plenty of overlap. Some analysts have already indicated
that it makes sense for Cheuvreux de Virieu to be sold, although insiders say it
would be ridiculous to sell the premier stockbroker in Paris. "It's obvious that
five stockbrokers are too many for Cr&eacute;dit Agricole," says a member of the
CNCA group. The fifth, not yet referred to, is Compagnie Parisienne de
R&eacute;escompte (CPR), 29.5% owned by Banque Indosuez. Although CPR operates
independently, Indosuez is the reference shareholder, responsible for CPR's
solvency.

<P> But it would be foolish to imagine that the CNCA/Indosuez relationship will
progress like the integration of SBC Warburg, ING Barings and Deutsche Morgan
Grenfell. CNCA doesn't necessarily have global ambitions. It has a history of
attempting to expand its retail base in France, adding the products of mutual
funds, and life and general risk assurance. Its forays into corporate banking and
international finance have been tentative add-ons.

<P> Nor do the personalities at the top of CNCA and Indosuez convey much
commitment to global investment banking. "Thierry Coste [board member responsible
for capital markets at CNCA] has a clear vision," says a former colleague, "but
he's too French." At Indosuez, former colleagues remember de Korsak having once
said: "The French don't know anything about investment banking, we need
Anglo-Saxons." But most of the Anglo-Saxons have left. The exception is WI Carr,
Indosuez's Asian subsidiary acquired in 1986, which last month won
<I>Euromoney</I> awards for best foreign securities firm in Pakistan and
Thailand: it is stuffed with Anglo-Saxons. A bid to integrate it more closely
with Indosuez under the name Carr Indosuez Asia in 1992 had "mixed results", says
a WI Carr source. But now Indosuez is again determined "to work more closely with
WI Carr as an integrated merchant bank in Asia", the source says. WI Carr is seen
as an integral part of the new strategy devised by Indosuez and McKinsey, and
given a stamp of approval by Cr&eacute;dit Agricole.

<P> In Paris any rapprochement between CNCA and Indosuez is likely to produce a
clash at the highest level. Indosuez, despite calling itself a merchant bank, is
as deeply riven with politics as the biggest French banks, say former employees.
The people who run French banks "are all from the same class", explains a French
investment banker. "Very few of these people have projects for their banks, they
have projects for themselves. They're all fighting for their own position."

<P> The same phenomenon has been observed at BNP and Paribas, says the banker:
"The domestic power-base fights back to take over international." Only
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, with a more eclectic approach to
recruitment and risk-taking, has to some extent exorcised this French curse, the
banker says.

<P> CNCA/Indosuez is perhaps the only big act of consolidation that can possibly
go ahead in a French banking sector which is crying out to be rationalized. With
strong trade unions and powerful labour laws, it would be almost impossible for
two big banks to combine, lay off staff and achieve economies of scale as they
have in the US and the UK. The big banks are looking at Cr&eacute;dit Industriel
&amp; Commercial (CIC), but big layoffs are unlikely to be part of any deal.
"There's only room for complementary acquisitions," says a French bank analyst.

<P> The French commercial banks are in no state to make acquisitions anyway. The
Association Fran&ccedil;aise des Banques (AFB) has complained of the unfair
advantages enjoyed by the mutual and savings bank sector, and by the Poste and
Cr&eacute;dit Agricole. Mutual and savings banks can offer customers tax-free
deposit accounts, Cr&eacute;dit Agricole and the Caisse des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts
et Consignations (CDC) are the only institutions allowed to take deposits from
notaries (in the course of notarized transactions such as house purchases). The
commercial banks, members of the AFB, are subject to much stricter labour
agreements, including a 1937 decree preventing them from opening at weekends.
(Other classes of banks can open at weekends.) Also, unlike the mutual and
savings banks, commercial banks have to answer to shareholders, the AFB argues.

<P> Banque de France governor Jean-Claude Trichet last month warned about
competitive distortions in the French banking sector. He expressed concern that
"certain types of commercial activity become dangerous when the cost of
resources, general overheads and the risk fail to provide enough return on
capital to ensure the strength of financial institutions".

<P> The governor "has declared open war on the mutualists, the Poste, the caisse
d'&eacute;pargne..." wrote a correspondent jubilantly in <I>Le Monde</I>. But
those in the banking sector are sceptical that Trichet or anyone else is willing
to dismantle any distortions in the short term. French treasury officials have
warned Cr&eacute;dit Agricole that its exclusive right to notary deposits may not
be renewed, according to press reports. But these deposits are not crucial to
Cr&eacute;dit Agricole. They amount to around Ffr17 billion and, though they
command only 1% interest, they are costly to administer, the bank says.
Nevertheless the AFB claims the deposits allowed Cr&eacute;dit Agricole to build
up Ffr15 billion in additional capital over the last 20 years.

<P> "It's unlikely Cr&eacute;dit Agricole will be penalized while it's helping
the government to subsidize failing French farmers," says a ratings analyst. The
real competitive advantage of Cr&eacute;dit Agricole is that it is "a really good
bank", says a French banking supervisor.

<P> Its purchase of Banque Indosuez was made after "kicking the idea around for
four or five years", say insiders. Cr&eacute;dit Agricole is like a "slow
steamroller". It took years to decide that acquisition was the way into the
corporate market. Now competitors are watching impatiently for the bank to make
its first strategic mistake with Banque Indosuez. They may be watching for a
while.&#009;

<H3>DEAL INSIDER  </H3>
<p>
<H2>The arranged marriage </H2>
<I>STEVEN IRVINE</I><BR><BR>
<B>Issuer: EBRD</B> <BR>
<B>Amount: Dm1 billion</B> <BR>
<B>Maturity: 5 years</B> <BR>
<B>Launched: Monday January 29</B> <BR>
<B>Lead managers: BZW, Nomura</B> <BR>
<BR>
<font size=3>
&quot;You want to make sure your leads are awake, sweating at night, and
we knew they would be.&quot; This was how Mark Cutis, treasurer of the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) justified picking a decidedly
odd couple of banks to launch its benchmark foray into five-year Deutschmarks,
its first benchmark for two years. As speculation grew about the EBRD move,
few expected the names of BZW and Nomura, houses with little Deutschmark
track record, to appear <I>together</I> on the winning ticket. No-one was
more surprised than the banks themselves. And, like parties to an extreme
form of arranged marriage, they did not discover their partner's identity
right up until a final planning conference call on the Friday evening before
the Monday night launch into Asia. <BR>
<BR>
At first, Nomura's syndicate head, Andrew Asbury, suspected a Swiss house
would be involved to provide a mix of Asian institutional buying and European
retail. When his opposite number at a Swiss firm said nothing much was going
on, his curiosity grew. Meanwhile, BZW thought a German house would be involved,
if only for political reasons. But with an American sitting at the EBRD
treasurer's desk, and one who had spent 10 years at Merrill Lynch and a
year in Germany, a gutsy rather than political approach arose. But as Cutis
commented to the leads: &quot;It <I>will</I> be political if the deal is
a failure.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>I</B>n fact, Cutis picked Nomura and BZW because these houses needed
to establish a presence in the Deutschmark sector and so had a lot at stake.
He, too, had a lot at stake, the issue being his debut benchmark as treasurer
following the departure of Ren&eacute; Karsenti to the European Investment
Bank (EIB). This way he could rely on total commitment - of both firms'
balance sheets - as well as highly attractive terms, including a promise
to ensure liquidity by making a bid/offer spread of one basis point (in
yield) on institutional trades of over Dm25 million for the first six months.
<BR>
<BR>
But, as with every deal, personal relationships were as crucial to the birth
as the technical details. Although Nomura and BZW were not familiar with
each other, the EBRD had a long-standing relationship with Nomura. And while
BZW had never won an EBRD mandate before, its did have its foot in the door.
Last summer, two BZW executives - origination head, Yann Gindre, and Jean-Louis
Ebelin, a director in the bank's origination group - were part of a yachting
crew, together with Jean-Marc Debricon, one of the EBRD's four-strong funding
team. Their joint efforts on that occasion proved rather less than successful;
they came in third in a three-boat race. Six months later they fared much
better in what turned out to be a fully-sold deal, coming in flat to a recent
EIB offering that in the previous two weeks had widened out to 25 basis
points over the Bobl 116, the German government five-year benchmark. Un-like
most five-year Deut-schmark deals, spreads on the EBRD issue did not widen.
The action began on Thursday morning, January 25, when Ebelin spotted a
swap opportunity, provided the credit was of high enough standing to be
noticed in the overcrowded area of five-year Deutschmarks. He asked Rob
Jolliffe, BZW's joint head of syndicate, what he thought of five-year Deutsch-marks.
The market being heavily oversold, Jolliffe gave the appropriate reply but
asked who the issuer was - at which point he became interested. &quot;Any
other name with the market in this shape, I would probably have dismissed
out of hand,&quot; says Jolliffe. <BR>
<BR>
The EBRD'S borrowing programme is relatively small at Ecu 1.5 billion, giving
it rarity value. So, the next thing was to convince the EBRD. Ebelin and
Jolliffe put the proposal to Debricon, who took it to Cutis and the head
of funding, Ayesha Shah. Cutis was understandably cautious and became even
more nervous as, over the next couple of hours, the EIB spread widened a
further 2bp. EBRD told BZW &quot;thanks but no thanks&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Next morning, however, swap spreads widened and Cutis began to have second
thoughts. But, when he picked up the phone to sound out market opinion,
his first call was not to BZW. Instead, he talked to Ian Annand, the senior
origination officer at Nomura, a bank with which EBRD had often dealt. Coincidentally,
Nomura had been suggesting a similar Deutschmark deal - the idea being to
launch into Asian hours. &quot;We knew Nomura could handle this transaction,&quot;
says Cutis. <BR>
<BR>
By contrast, BZW was something of an unknown quantity so Cutis and former
Nomura swaps trader, Shah, wanted to meet the team. Debricon invited them
to make a presentation the following Monday afternoon. That wasn't soon
enough for Ebelin and Jolliffe who could see the deal slipping away from
them. On Friday afternoon at 3.30 pm they said they would visit straight
away. <BR>
<BR>
At EBRD'S offices, Cutis said to Jolliffe: &quot;I'm an Asian central bank.
Sell this bond to me.&quot; Jolliffe, a former salesman, had no trouble
giving a pitch. At the end, Jolliffe, who along with Steve Hones had joined
BZW in the summer from JP Morgan, asked Cutis if he would he buy these bonds
if he were an investor. Cutis said yes. Nomura was told about the decision
and that the two banks would get together on a conference call at 6pm. Then
came a surprise over what Cutis admits was a &quot;non-traditional&quot;
combination of leads. But Jolliffe and Asbury were soon on the same wavelength.
Another conference call was agreed for 2pm on Sunday. Both lead managers
drew up a preferred syndicate list and found, once again, that the EBRD
team was interested in market suc-cess not politics. Shah said: &quot;They
asked us if we had any political considerations and we asked them to define
what this meant.&quot; On Monday morning, the EBRD told the leads to arrange
the whole thing and fax them what was going to be put on the screens - a
spread of 27bp over the Bobl was announced at 11am. <BR>
<BR>
<B>T</B>he deal got off to a slow start on Monday afternoon, but overnight
the Asian demand went crazy. Cutis came in at 7am on the Tueday morning
and was &quot;pleasantly surprised&quot; by the numbers. Nomura had predicted
60% placement in Asia which seemed bold. <BR>
<BR>
But this prediction was more than realized: Nomura had placed 70% and BZW
positioned 35% of its allotment overnight, with one ticket alone being for
Dm50 million. Then Europe &quot;kicked in&quot;. At the close on Tuesday,
Nomura had sold well over its allotment of Dm375 million; by this time,
too, BZW also had very little paper left. <BR>
<BR>
Unlike most five-year Deutschmark deals this one did not widen, indicating
that the pricing was correct. Cutis had turned down the tempting offer of
one of the leads to take some punishment and price at 25 over the Bobl.
In fact, the issue subsequently tightened to trade at 26bp over, and on
the day following the payment date it was bid at 25 over.

<H3> PAKISTAN </H3>


<H2> <B>Power to the people proves a costly wager</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>Pakistan's
successful private power initiative has helped overcome an electricity shortage
but has created a foreign exchange burden. The government is gambling on
increased capacity leading to greater consumption and higher productivity. But
will this be sufficient to pay for imported fuel and the tariffs charged by the
foreign-owned power stations? By Philip Eade</B> </H4> 

<P> Senior officials from
Enron arrived in Islamabad earlier this year expecting to see the avenues covered
with red carpets. The US energy company clicked its corporate finger at everyone,
including prime minister Benazir Bhutto, to ensure that all necessary doors would
be opened &#173; and fast. "The kind of support they were demanding was
ludicrous," says a Pakistani power company executive. "They expected the prime
minister to run around with them shouting 'do this, do that'."

<P> Enron, though, had not reckoned on the equally swollen egos of some Pakistani
politicians. In the end the company's plan to build a 750MW thermal power plant
collapsed amid disagreement with the government about the cost of the imported
naphtha fuel.

<P> More galling for Enron was the fact that Pakistan was not prepared to bend
over backwards to revive negotiations. The country's private power initiative has
been so successful<B> </B>at attracting investment that there are already more
than enough plants under construction &#173; the government does not need to bow
and scrape to arrogant multinationals.

<P> Pakistan's power policy is no longer about wooing investors. It has
progressed way beyond that. Put in place in March 1994, it includes a package of
incentives, including a generous bulk power tariff of 6.5 cents per KW and
foreign currency guarantees, reckoned to be among the most attractive in the
world. When the policy began, Pakistan faced a shortage of 2,000MW during peak
load hours and extremely low annual per capita consumption of electricity of
around 300KW.

<P> A conservative projection for the annual increase in demand at that time was
8% for the next 25 years, which called for 44,000MW of additional capacity by
2018.

<P> Such an ambitious programme could not, it was decided, be financed in the
public sector because of IMF ceilings, hence the emphasis on making conditions
for private investors as attractive as possible.

<P> The initial target of 7,000MW has now been revised down to 4,000MW. This is
because the response from private finance, well beyond the forecast of the
policy's chief architect, Shahid Hassan Khan, has narrowed the focus to the
investment that can go forward now. Projects worth close to $4 billion &#173;
more than the total amount of foreign investment in Pakistan since partition
&#173; have secured financing. All this is against a backdrop of the breakdown of
law and order in Karachi, and generally lukewarm interest in emerging markets.

<P> So successful has Pakistan's power policy been that other developing
countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have copied its terms almost to the
letter. Only China has been too proud to duplicate it, while India bloodied its
nose because of clumsy dealings with Enron last year.

<P> <B>Buying power from foreign sources </B>

<P> Power, say some analysts, is the one sector in Pakistan showing much life.
The new power plants, they argue, will be the country's saviour, by promoting
economic growth and increased prosperity.

<P> "If you look at historical data,<B> </B>per capita GNP is very closely linked
to per capita consumption of electricity," says Syed Akbar Kazim, the finance
director of Southern Electric Power Company (Sepcol), whose 117MW thermal plant
is due to begin operating next year. "If you accept the correlation, the 40%
increase in electricity capacity ought to lead to a 40% increase in GNP, which is
enormous by any standards."

<P> But in the meantime the government will need to find large amounts of foreign
exchange to import fuel and &#173; given that most of the financial backing is
foreign debt and equity &#173; convert private operators' electricity payments
into dollars. By reserving incentives for projects with more than 100MW capacity
the government has effectively ruled out large-scale local involvement and may
have sown the seeds for a balance of payments crisis on a scale beyond Pakistan's
capabilities.<B> </B>

<P> "The government should have given permission to, say, 20 Pakistani companies
to build 20MW to 30MW plants which are manageable within national resources,"
says one Islamabad-based entrepreneur. "That way they could have got between
400MW and 500MW within 14 to 16 months. Instead, the government's insistence on
100MW-plus projects eliminated 90% of Pakistani entrepreneurs. Larger plants
should have been built by Wapda [the Water and Power Development Authority] or
the world's leading power companies, after competitive solicited proposals.
Unfortunately, the private power policy was just a money-making exercise for the
government. On a micro level it's a beautiful policy &#173; in terms of
attracting investors. But when you implement it at a macro level, the loopholes
become only too apparent."

<P> The biggest dangers &#173; so far as investors are concerned &#173; appear to
be posed by the poor financial state of the distribution companies, Wapda and
Karachi Electricity Supply Company (KESC), and slender foreign exchange reserves.

<P> <B>Price rise dangers</B>

<P> As things stand, the chances of the distribution companies defaulting on
their obligations to independent power projects (IPPs) appear to be quite high.
"Wapda's finances are in a terrible state," admits Sepcol's Kazim. "They have
huge arrears from government departments, which may cause a cash crunch." The
poor financial state of both Wapda and KESC is also a result of transmission and
distribution (T&amp;D) losses, which have increased sharply in recent years. For
KESC, for example, such losses amounted to 31% of electricity supplied in 1995,
compared with 27% in 1994.

<P> The 1995 annual report states: "The existing T&amp;D system is overloaded and
inadequate to cater to the maximum demand of consumers, which requires major
augmentation and rehabilitation."

<P> KESC, for which NatWest Markets is seeking a strategic investor for partial
privatization later this year, hopes that expansion and rehabilitation of the
transmission system &#173; with the help of loans from the Asian Development Bank
&#173; will reduce such losses. Wapda and KESC will also benefit from bringing in
new consumers. Some 60% of households in Pakistan are without electricity. "Even
if these just use a single light and fan, it would mean a tremendous boost to
revenue," says Sepcol's Kazim.

<P> Hamid Butt, head of investment banking at Citibank in Karachi, adds: "The
only reason Wapda might be unable to pay for the power is if they can't sell it.
The only question is whether people will buy the power, and I think the answer is
yes. There is a shortfall of 2,000MW now which will soon rise to 3,000MW."

<P> But both distribution companies will still have to cope with the problem of
customers not paying their bills, meters not being read because of urban
disturbances, and the theft of electricity using <I>kundas</I> &#173; metal hooks
used to tap into electricity supply lines.

<P> The IPPs are fully aware of threats to their income streams. A team from
Hubco, whose first plant came on line earlier this year, is training staff at
Wapda in better collection methods. An official at the Karachi headquarters of
Hubco points out that it received its first large payment for electricity &#173;
$22 million &#173; from Wapda on August 1. "They paid very promptly," he says.
"They realize it's serious business." The Hubco official commends the government
for changes in this year's budget, which mean that electricity allowances for
provincial governments are now paid directly to Wapda, easing its cashflow
difficulties. But Hubco is only the first power supplier that will need to be
dealt with. The real problems will begin when the rest of the IPPs come on line
over the next year or two.

<P> Wapda and KESC will meanwhile have to find ways of striking a balance between
investor returns and politically sensitive consumer needs. Industry analysts are
already predicting electricity price rises of about 15% in Karachi by the end of
this year and much more in the years to come. The price of electricity in
Pakistan is currently around PRs3.5 (10 cents) per KW and households already
spend on average PRs500 of their PRs3,000 monthly income on electricity. It is
hard to see where they will get the money to pay for electricity if its price
rises by 50%, as some analysts are forecasting. Price rises sufficient to enable
the distribution companies to fulfil their obligations under the power purchase
agreements with IPPs will be hugely unpopular and damaging to Pakistan's
competitiveness.

<P> IPPs derive comfort from the fact that the distribution companies'
obligations are guaranteed by the government under a specific agreement. Perhaps
more important, it is a government that has never defaulted or requested a
moratorium on its external debt.

<P> The availability of foreign exchange is problematic. According to Javed Noel,
joint secretary at the finance ministry, "initial estimates are that between
4,000MW and 5,000MW would not imply balance of payments constraints". Yet such
assertions are at least partly based on an act of faith that extra power will
enable the production of sufficient extra exports to offset the foreign exchange
costs of buying fuel and paying the IPPs under their power purchase agreements.

<P> Power plants under construction are already sucking in capital-equipment
imports. As they start generating power over the next year or so, a sharp
increase in fuel imports will add to the strain. In March the government capped
the number of projects that rely on imported fuel &#173; hence its reluctance to
entertain the Enron project &#173; and stipulated that in future proposals would
only be considered if they tapped indigenous resources.

<P> Khalid Nazir, director at AKD Securities in Karachi, calculates that as more
power stations come on line, fuel import costs will rise from $104 million in
1996-97 to $414 million by 1998-99. He further estimates that the annual cost of
servicing the debt associated with the projects, which the government has
guaranteed in dollars, will rise from $68 million to $439 million over the same
period, based on interest rates of 10%.

<P> Meanwhile the foreign exchange cost of paying dividends, based on guarantees
of around 20% returns on equity, will rise from $34 million to $239 million.
Nazir estimates that combining these with existing external debt-servicing costs
and dividends to shareholders in privatized companies, Pakistan's dollar
requirements by 2000 will be $3.6 billion. He says this will place "extreme
pressure on the government reserves and the currency situation".

<P> Others are more sanguine. Citibank's Butt says: "Obviously there is concern
that the balance of payments will come under strain, but our estimate is that an
additional $700 million to $800 million would not be unmanageable. There should
be a big spurt in GDP and the additional growth should take care of the extra the
government has to pay."

<P> <B>Balance of payments crisis</B>

<P> Even without the extra burden imposed by the IPPs, there is already concern
about the government's increasing reliance on short-term foreign currency debt in
excess of its exchange reserves, which leaves it vulnerable to external shocks
such as rising interest rates. Another worry is that foreign currency deposits in
Pakistani banks amount to some $7.4 billion, whereas foreign exchange reserves
stood at just $1.7 billion at the end of July, indicating that most of the money
held on account has already been spent. A large and sudden outflow from these
accounts, which could result from a loss of confidence in government policies,
would trigger a balance of payments crisis. Some observers have even suggested
that the country could be heading for a Mexico-type crisis.

<P> Syed Shahid Husain, former senior executive vice-president of the World Bank,
wrote recently: "The slightest crisis in confidence and the run on these funds
could wreck the national currency, and cause high inflation and depression." A
Karachi-based economist adds: "If there is a $1 billion outflow, Pakistan's
economy will at least slide. If it exceeds $2 billion, the economy will crash.
The US government had to arrange $10 billion in hard cash and $18 billion in
guarantees to bail out Mexico. Where will Pakistan find that sort of money?" A
run on foreign deposits almost occurred last November when it was rumoured that
the government would freeze convertible accounts. The panic subsided only after
the government reassured depositors.

<P> Allegations that between $5 billion and $6 billion has been siphoned from the
economy during the past two-and-a-half years through official corruption do
little to ease worries about the balance of payments. Stories abound of expensive
overseas properties being bought by influential members of the government. A
recent survey of international businessmen carried out by the Berlin-based
publication <I>Transparency International</I> suggested that only Nigeria is more
corrupt than Pakistan. And according to some newspaper reports, even IMF board
members are demanding that the organization goes public on the level of
corruption in Pakistan.

<P> "Corruption stands in the way of some of the good foreign investment and much
of the domestic investment," says Karachi-based journalist Sultan Ahmed. "It
retards industrial growth and hurts the industries already functioning. It
slashes the revenues of the state, inflates public expenditure, reduces the
efficacy of public spending and cripples the social sector, because corruption is
large in the educational and health sectors as well." Husain adds: "Pakistan is
inexorably moving towards its worst economic crisis." He describes Bhutto's
government as one "with its political authority on the wane and moral authority
lost".

<P> <B>Tough budget to satisy the IMF </B>

<P> Pakistan's balance of payments situation has recently been adversely affected
by large budget deficits &#173; last year around $4 billion &#173; which have
tended to be financed by increases in the current account deficit through
increased imports. Pakistan's current account deficit last year amounted to some
$3 billion, despite $8.6 billion of exports &#173; the highest it has ever
achieved. The country remains overly reliant on cotton and textile products which
make up two-thirds of exports. According to the finance ministry's Noel, the
higher-than-normal level of imports not only sprang from increased purchases of
machinery for power plants but also increased fertilizer orders. "We're hoping to
reap the benefit by way of higher agricultural growth and fewer imports of food
and edible oils," he says. "The imports of machinery for the power sector are not
a permanent feature. They should gradually fade out."

<P> During the first half of last year, Pakistan's exports were priced out of the
market because of currency devaluation among competitors and high domestic
inflation (around 11%) because of a rising budget deficit. The government took
various measures to correct this situation in October 1995, including devaluing
the rupee by 7% and levying a 10% duty on non-essential imports. As a result,
exports, which had fallen by 5.3% in the first half, rose by 14.9% in the second
half (to June 1996). Meanwhile, imports, which had risen 23.2% in the first half,
grew by just 4% in the second half.

<P> Conscious of the need to raise revenues and reduce the budget deficit, the
government passed a tough federal budget on June 13, imposing $1.1 billion of new
taxes for 1996-97, including an across-the-board sales tax on imports and
manufactured goods. The budget was an about-turn from that of a year ago and a
return to an IMF-guided programme of structural reforms. The primary aim was to
reduce the overall budget deficit to 4% of GDP from an estimated 5% in 1995-96.
This was in compliance with IMF wishes, which held back on the third tranche of
its $600 million standby arrangement until after the budget, so that it could
gauge the fulfilment of its targets as well as the government's specific
budgetary measures.

<P> As <I>Euromoney</I> went to press the IMF mission had still not visited
Pakistan. It therefore remained unclear whether the Pakistan government would
succeed in securing the next standby arrangement tranche and be able to
renegotiate a medium-term extended structural adjustment facility.

<P> The government has had little room to squeeze expenditure. Defence spending
will always be a high priority while the dispute with India over Kashmir remains
unresolved. According to figures produced by the finance ministry, defence
expenditure as a proportion of total government expenditure fell from 26% in 1988
to 23% last year.

<P> However, defence expenditure and debt servicing still make up almost half
government expenditure. As a proportion of current expenditure (excluding capital
projects), they amount to over 70% and together they swallow up more than 100% of
total tax revenues. Meanwhile, spending on the social sector, including education
and health, remains low at 14.9% of total expenditure. Several "low priority"
development projects have been slashed recently.

<P> <B>Tax reform needed</B>

<P> The constraints on cutting expenditure intensify the need to make the most of
taxation. Pakistan's tax system suffers from a weak collection system and a very
narrow base. Just a million people out of a population of 130 million pay direct
tax. Fewer than 20% of these declare annual incomes in excess of PRs100,000
($3,000).

<P> The general sales tax has broadened the base, but it has also been widely
criticized by the business community as likely to lead to inflation and
recession. The Karachi Stock Exchange KSE-100 index fell 5.2% in the two days
after the announcement of the budget. "This budget has killed business
confidence," says AKD's Nazir. "My own tax rate went from 16% to 33% in one day.
I had several people phone me to ask where to send their CVs for jobs abroad."

<P> "The imposition of a general sales tax is a sensible long-term measure," he
adds. "But the hike in rates is highly inflationary and probably
counterproductive. By increasing the rates from 15% to 18% and from 20% to 23% in
a tax-unfriendly country, the government is virtually encouraging tax fraud. A
more realistic policy would have been to reduce the rate and concentrate on
efficient collection &#173; rather than simply squeezing the existing taxpayers
and thereby increasing tax-evasion incentives."

<P> The budget review of Karachi stockbroking firm BMA Capital Management broadly
agrees: "The absence of any major concrete measures to stimulate investment, make
taxation more equitable and cut non-developmental expenditure, along with a poor
track record in achieving budgetary targets, will limit the macroeconomic impact
of the budget. The GDP growth target of 6.3% appears to be rather ambitious given
the harsh fiscal and monetary measures that are associated with the current
budget, which is inherently recessionary in nature."

<P> Urban resentment at the budget has been increased by the absence of any
measures to tax income from agriculture in an effective way. The benefit of such
a tax to revenues has perhaps been exaggerated: although over half of the
population are farmers, agriculture accounts for only 24% of GDP. "Most farmers
would not meet the tax threshold," says Citbank's Butt. "Even rich
agriculturalists aren't as wealthy as your average multinational executive."

<P> Nevertheless, not only is such a tax a priority for the IMF, its absence
almost certainly hinders collection of other taxes. "Those who are paying their
taxes know full well that no-one in agriculture or in government is paying," says
AKD's Nazir. "So long as people recognize that it is one rule for one and another
rule for another, then the system won't work. You shouldn't underestimate the
earning power of small businessmen here in Pakistan. Many of them earn perhaps $5
million per year and yet for tax purposes they don't exist. What is called for is
radical tax reform. The IMF recipe is disastrous. You can't go around prescribing
the same medicine to everybody. Instead of telling the government to raise the
level of taxation, they should tell them to widen the net."

<P> Taxation can go only part of the way to solving balance of payments problems.
As the IPPs come on line the government is pinning its hopes on a spurt in GDP
sufficient to produce exports to offset additional forex requirements.

<P> The growth in GDP for 1995-96 was a satisfactory 6%, but it was very much the
product of a good cotton crop of 10.5 million bales. The performance of
manufacturing remains disappointing. The growth of large-scale manufacturing
&#173; which accounts for 70% of manufacturing output &#173; slowed dramatically
from an average of 7% between 1982 and 1993 to only 0.5% in 1994-95 and 1.5% in
1995-96. Too many spinning plants lie idle because they cannot produce yarn at
competitive prices &#173; the result of historical protection and lack of
investment. Carpet exports have also tapered off, perhaps because importers are
becoming careful about not purchasing carpets that may have been made by child
labour.

<P> The government is relying on the increase in the country's power supply to
reinvigorate such industries and avert a balance of payments crisis. Whether the
goal can be reached is very much an open question.

<H2> <B>Floating-rate funding</B> </H2> <P> The government of Pakistan has become
increasingly reliant on commercial banks to meet its foreign currency borrowing
requirements. Such loans amount to around 15% of Pakistan's total external debt
of $24 billion. But given the country's credit rating and perceived risk, banks
are unwilling to lend much beyond 12 months. So the country's first floating-rate
note (FRN) issue at the end of June, led by Citibank and worth $150 million, is
an important step towards diversifying the government's funding sources.

<P> The after-market performance of Pakistan's debut sovereign $200 million
Eurobond, issued in late 1994, has been rather disappointing, although it is now
trading at a slight premium. The FRN was favoured as a means of achieving
longer-term funding at a lower cost. "With fixed-term securities, investment
funds tend to prefer investment-grade credits," says Javed Noel, joint secretary
at the finance ministry. "The floating-rate note seemed a sensible way of
controlling the cost of our funding as well as extending the tenor." The FRN was
sold at a weighted average of 210 basis points over Libor compared with 350bp
over Libor for the Eurobond. With put options at 18 months and 36 months, the
tenor of the security can be extended to a total of four-and-a-half years.

<P> The FRN not only provided a means of going beyond the one-year tenors
available in the syndicated loan market, it also enabled the government to make
use of investors that had already been granting the country short-term commercial
bank loans. According to Sumant Sinha, vice-president of capital markets at
Citibank in London, the attraction to investors who already hold short-term
non-tradeable Pakistani paper is that much of the risk is now on price rather
than on default. "Investors feel they can get out at whatever time, depending on
their comfort levels."

<P> Because the FRN is traded through Euroclear, which is fairly opaque, the
government cannot look and see what investors are doing, and therefore cannot
exert any pressure. The put options are anonymous, but it is not expected that
they will be exercised unless there is a major calamity.

<P> So far as the government was concerned, the other plus was expanding its
investor base, in particular into the Asian market. Asian investors tend to be
very FRN-oriented and Pakistan has never borrowed in Asia before &#173; even by
way of syndicated loans.

<P> Buoyed by the success of its debut FRN issue, the government is keen to
access the market more regularly, possibly starting with another FRN issue of a
similar size this autumn. According to Noel at the finance ministry, the
government plans to have outstanding international issues totalling between $500
million and $600 million. But the government will almost certainly have to wait
until the conclusion of talks with the IMF, whose mission was due to visit the
country this month, and the subsequent reaction of the rating agencies. &#173;

pricing could damage your liberty</B> </H2> <H3> <B>Pakistan's Privatization
Commission has earned a reputation for professionalism and efficiency. But
despite the government's desire to speed up the sale of state companies, the
process has become bogged down. Especially problematic is the sale of telecoms
company PTCL, which has been hampered by regulatory problems and unrealistic
pricing  </B> </H3> <P> Across the road from the government secretariat in
Islamabad stands the gleaming white Bhutto House. The building was conceived in
the 1980s as a museum to celebrate Pakistan's state-owned industries. But by the
time it was completed the original purpose was deemed outmoded. It is now a
shrine to private enterprise, home to a shopping arcade and a collection of
private companies. Its next-door neighbour is the Privatization Commission.

<P> Established in 1991 while Nawaz Shariff was prime minister, the Privatization
Commission's staff have come and gone with each successive change of government.
But its divestment strategy has remained more or less constant, along with its
objectives &#173; to improve production, reduce government debt, develop capital
markets and introduce a shareholder democracy. Over the years, it has also gained
a reputation with foreign bankers and investors for its professionalism and
efficiency, in stark contrast to some of the more chaotic corridors of
bureaucracy over the road.

<P> The commission oversaw the privatization of three banks and 90 industrial
units between 1991 and 1994. The sale of the cement industry in particular proved
a tremendous success, with production now up 40% in most units.

<P> The task of involving domestic investors more in the process is being tackled
by the $100 million Privatization Fund, launched earlier this year by James
Capel's office in Islamabad. The fund will initially consist of shares in 12
unlisted and 12 listed companies which the government has partly privatized; it
will be listed on the London Stock Exchange as well as the three local stock
exchanges. This year probably the most successful privatization in the programme
has been carried out &#173; the sale of a 26% strategic stake in the 1,600MW Kot
Addu power plant to UK company National Power for $215 million.

<P> "All four bidders [National Power, British Gas, AD Consortium and Southern
Electricity] agreed afterwards that the process had been very transparent," says
Mudassar Malik, a director of Karachi firm BMA Capital Management, which advised
on the sale. "The proof is that the losers have come back to bid for [another
state-owned power plant] Jamshoro. The government can now proceed and divest the
remainder of the equity."

<P> The government will be hoping that the successful conclusion of the Kot Addu
sale, albeit a year or so later than planned, will speed up programme as a whole.
The shortlist of bidders for Jamshoro is now expected to be drawn up in
September. Other privatizations in the pipeline include the Karachi Electricity
Supply Company, for which NatWest Capital Markets is currently seeking strategic
bidders, and the Faisalabad Electricity Board.

<P> The total size of the privatization programme is well over $20 billion, but
at the recent historical rate of progress it will take around 20 years to
complete. Progress has become rather bogged down with the attempts to sell
strategically important entities such as Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation
Limited (PTCL), the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) and United Bank
Limited (UBL). The IMF is among those calling for an acceleration that will
enable the government to reduce its debt service charges and meet the future
dollar liabilities of its private power programme.

<P> In some cases, speed can introduce flaws, as has happened with the UBL
strategic sale for which the government was accused of allowing insufficient time
for due diligence earlier this year. The Privatization Commission refused to
allow a second potential buyer &#173; Faysal Islamic Bank of Bahrain &#173; more
time to check UBL's financial health, leaving Saudi Arabia's Bisharahil group as
the only prequalified bidder.

<P> Abdullah Yussuf, secretary of the Privatization Commission, explains it as a
case of simply accepting an unconditional bid over one that was conditional.
"Besides," he adds, "if you look at just one of Faysal's conditions, that the
government deposit PRs20 billion [$601 million] in UBL without interest for five
years, you can see that theirs was effectively a negative bid." Nevertheless,
with the Bank of England rumoured to be among those voicing their concerns about
Bisharahil, it remains unclear whether management control will be transferred to
the successful bidder.

<P> But despite concern over the way the UBL sale has been handled, most analysts
seem to agree with the IMF that the programme as a whole needs to be speeded up.
In this context, most eyes are on PTCL (known as PTC until its incorporation on
January 1). It is valued now at around $5 billion and completion of its sale will
be of immense symbolic importance, besides providing much-needed opportunities
for the retirement of the government's most costly liabilities. It will also have
a huge impact on the Karachi Stock Exchange, where it already accounts for half
of turnover and around one-third of total market capitalization.

<P> The PTCL privatization has been fraught with difficulties ever since 1992
when the government appointed Bear Stearns to advise on the sale of a 26%
strategic stake. Four years later, with a new financial adviser (Morgan Grenfell)
in place, there is still no shortlist of bidders. Deadlines have come and gone,
but still the government appears to be scarcely nearer to offloading its most
valuable asset. "It has taken a lot longer to generate enthusiasm than we had
thought," admits Ian Logan, assistant director in the emerging markets division
of Morgan Grenfell in London. "And we're not there yet."

<P> Some of the reasons for the difficulties encountered by Morgan Grenfell are
obvious enough. For example, it must appear rather odd to many investors that the
new, supposedly independent regulator &#173; the head of the Pakistan
Telecommunications Authority &#173; is none other than the chairman of PTCL, Mian
Javed. By law, Javed was supposed to have resigned from PTCL when becoming
regulator but he has failed to do so. One can read all sorts of reasons into why
he has stayed put.

<P> Another concern is that the telecoms law setting the framework for the sale
has still not been put before the National Assembly. An ordinance &#173; similar
to a presidential decree &#173; was promulgated last November and was supposed to
be put before the National Assembly in the first quarter of 1996. Unfortunately
this hasn't happened. Ordinances can be changed every four months in their
renewal phase. Potential investors are therefore unsure of the legal environment
they are dealing with.

<P> But progress has also been hampered by the government's failure to seize the
moment and sell its strategic stake back in 1994, since when the world markets
have become rather swamped with telecoms issues.

<P> According to the government's initial pledge, the strategic sale was
originally supposed to go ahead immediately after the sale of an initial 2%
tranche to domestic investors in July 1994. Flushed with the success of the
domestic voucher sale, however, the government decided to sell a further 11% to
foreign investors through a global depositary receipt (GDR) issue in September.
Having sold the first tranche of vouchers for PRs30 each, the government achieved
a price of PRs55 for the GDRs, raising an additional $900 million.

<P> By any reckoning this was a good price, not least because the offering came
just before the Mexican crisis and the subsequent downturn in emerging markets.
However, when investors discovered that the sale documents prepared by Jardine
Fleming had overstated by 30% the number of telephone lines in operation, the
price of the GDRs slumped. Jardine Fleming, which had replaced Union Bank of
Switzerland just 10 days before the sale, mistook the number of lines installed
for the number in operation.

<P> <B>Avoiding old mistakes</B>

<P> In its haste to raise the money to meet specific debt repayments, the
government had insisted the sale of the second tranche go ahead without due
diligence. The original prospectus was therefore used again with a disclaimer as
to the accuracy of its information. The end result was a rather sour taste in the
mouths of many international investors.

<P> The extent to which all this has contributed to subsequent delays in the sale
of the strategic stake is debatable. But many feel the inflated price may have
raised the government's expectations to unrealistic levels. "The whole programme
here suffers from the problem that the government thinks its companies are worth
more than they are," says a foreign banker in Islamabad. "Compare that with what
happened in the UK where the government said we want to privatize utility
<I>x</I> and we'll see what the market will give us. Because they were realistic,
the programme was very quick."

<P> Two years on, for whatever reason, the PTCL strategic sale has still not
happened. The government eventually lost faith with Bear Stearns, which it felt
had undervalued PTCL, and appointed Morgan Grenfell in August 1995. But the new
financial adviser has found it equally hard to find investors willing to stump up
the required sums.

<P> All the original vouchers were converted into shares on August 6 following
the listing of PTCL's shares on Pakistan's three stock exchanges. Of these 74%
are class A shares (12% are traded on the stock exchange while 62% are still held
by the government). The remaining 26% are class B shares with enhanced voting
rights which Morgan Grenfell is attempting to sell. The revised target of June
has come and gone and still the formal prequalification phase has yet to begin.

<P> The conditions of the sale have now been radically altered to boost interest.
The original intention was to sell all 26% to a single operator or a group
controlled by the operator. But given that operators appeared unwilling to go it
alone while at the same time it was evident that there was interest from
financial investors, particularly project-finance funds in the Middle East and
South East Asia, the requirements were relaxed in April. "The intention was to
marry the two by allowing financial investors to form a bidding group with an
operator locked in under the terms of a management contract," explains Morgan
Grenfell's Logan. "There is no obligation on the operator to take any stake at
all, but many will want at least a small share."

<P> The contract will tie the operator in for seven years &#173; the same length
of time as PTCL's monopoly period. The operator will be obliged to provide
day-to-day management control for which he will be remunerated on a
performance-related basis. Logan says a number of groups are now looking at this
structure and making plans to visit Islamabad to meet the Privatization
Commission and, in effect, begin due diligence.

<P> Logan expects the mistake in the 1994 GDR prospectus to have little bearing
on the strategic sale, which is targeted at a completely different set of
investors. Besides, he explains, while Morgan Grenfell will be setting up a data
room for use by potential investors, the onus for due diligence this time lies
very much with the buyer.

<P> The list of interested bidders is thought to include various consortia led
respectively by General Electric, Mitsubishi, Deutsche Telekom, Indonesia Telkom,
British Telecom and Singapore Telecom. AT&amp;T has publicly stated that it will
not bid.

<P> Price remains a sensitive issue. Following the GDR issue, the voucher price
fell rapidly, reaching a low in November 1995 of around PRs27. It then proceeded
to rise to the mid-40s but has since come off again. As <I>Euromoney</I> went to
press, Morgan Grenfell had not completed its valuation report, and the price
expectations of the government remained something of an unknown quantity. "There
have been some ludicrous figures bandied around in the last year as to the value
of the whole company," says Logan. "Figures of $10 billion for it are quite
absurd. I think the government is now becoming more realistic."

<P> Over two years have elapsed since the initial domestic public offering, but
there would still be immense difficulties in presentation were the government
forced to let the class B shares go for less than PRs30 &#173; the price
Pakistani investors paid for their vouchers. Indeed, there are grounds for
arguing that the price should be considerably higher, because the company has
increased lines in operation and profits.

<P> The senior officials of the Privatization Commission cannot afford to slip up
and be deemed to be selling off the family silver cheaply. Incoming governments
in Pakistan have a habit of treating their predecessors harshly. The former
Privatization Commission chairman during the Nawaz Shariff government, General
Saeed Qadir, has been under house arrest since Benazir Bhutto came to power. The
current chairman, Naveed Qamar, may well think he has to tread carefully to avoid
suffering the same fate when the political tables are next turned.&#009;*

<H2> <B>Efficiency upgrade</B> </H2> <P> The success of Pakistan's privatization
programme relies heavily on the efficient working of the local stock market. So
the speed with which the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) has developed its central
depositary will come as a relief to the government and investors. The law
allowing for the electronic book entry of shares is expected to be passed within
the next couple of months.

<P> The Central Depositary Company (CDC) was first incorporated in January 1993
and it awarded the contract for the design and implementation of the central
depositary to an IBM-led consortium in November 1994. Since then it has taken
under two years to complete the project &#173; a far shorter time than in many
other countries &#173; at a cost of around $5 million. The CDC is owned 30% by
the KSE, 20% by Citibank, 10% by the IFC, 10% by Muslim Commercial Bank and 5%
each by six other Pakistani financial institutions, including the Lahore and
Islamabad stock exchanges.

<P> Based on an initial design by consultants Price Waterhouse, the central
depositary is a hybrid system tailored to the Pakistani market which allows for
both scripless and physical transfer. It should help to improve settlement
procedures substantially. The need for such a system has become increasingly
urgent, with 775 companies listed and average daily turnover now worth around
PRs1 billion ($30 million), compared with PRs136 million when the country's
economic reforms got under way in 1991. As the government proceeds from the
strategic to the public offer stages of its sell-offs, these figures should rise
considerably.

<P> The current settlement system is expensive, laborious and often protracted.
"Registration is one of the biggest problems for foreign investors in the
Pakistani equity market," says Javed Hassan, equity sales manager at ING Barings
in London. "I've know situations where it has taken up to a year. If you don't
get the certificate back you can't sell the shares. This is one of the major
disincentives of this market for foreign investors. With the central depositary I
expect the potential investor base to increase by 50% to 60%."

<P> The old system can also be risky: the physical handling of shares providing
ample opportunity for fraud. From now the transfer will be instantaneous by way
of an electronic book entry system.

<P> "The central depositary provides a platform for further development and
increases investor confidence," says CDC chief executive Najam Ali. "Foreign
brokerages, many put off by the present system, are enthusiastic. Foreign
investors tend to be long-term, so their presence should lend the market
stability. They also act as a catalyst for local investors. On the domestic level
the impact will be felt over the next two to three years."

<P> The central depositary will become operational in phases. To begin with there
will be a gradual depositing of all eligible securities with the CDC, starting
with 80 to 100 of the most actively traded stocks in the first year. The most
liquid stocks, such as Hubco, ICI, MCB, Sui Southern and Enro will be brought
into the system as soon as it has been proven. Eventually it will become
mandatory for all new issues to be with the CDC.

<P> The central depositary is also expected to have a major impact on
secondary-market trading of domestic debt instruments, for which there is
virtually no market at present. "It will facilitate their settlement,
registration and trading," says Ali.

<p>
<H4>BONUSES </H4>
<H2>The Forrest Gump phenomenon </H2>
<font size=3>
Banking is a nasty, brutish business, in which kindness is a scarce commodity.
There is a time, however, which comes but once a year, when a spirit of
giving pervades the air. That time is bonus time. As bankers begin to salivate,
<I>Euromoney</I> attempts to spot who the big winners will be. <BR>
<BR>
One thing is certain: the absolute amount of the payouts is enormous. Indeed,
the payment of bonuses in the Square Mile is enough to skew the UK's national
wage average for March by a third of a percentage point, according to Derek
Bird at the UK's Central Statistical Office. <BR>
<BR>
So which bank employees will have the most to celebrate? Sterling and Ecu
bond dealers at BZW are set for a windfall. The gilt-edged market-making
operations of the bank generated pre-tax profits of over &#163;30 million
last year - making it the most profitable of all the City's gilt market-makers.
The Bank of England estimates that the total profit of all 20 gilt market-makers
was &#163;13 million last year, which suggests that many other firms suffered
large losses. <BR>
<BR>
A close eye is being kept on the newly-merged investment banks. For the
first time Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG) employees have
the same employment contracts. In theory, harmonization means that Deutsche
staff in London should do rather well compared to their counterparts based
in Germany. <BR>
<BR>
But DMG has strayed into a compliance minefield, with staff formerly employed
by Deutsche Bank, ranging from board level directors to associate directors,
facing surprise bills for national insurance and income tax payments. Payouts
could be slashed by thousands of pounds. <BR>
<BR>
Initially, Deutsche staff members were told that their bonus payments would
take the form of preference shares in the parent bank, immediately convertible
to cash. This method of payment allowed staff to defer tax liabilities for
up to a year and dodge national insurance contributions outright. Early
in February, however, Deutsche's compliance department realized that senior
directors, due to be paid in advance of the announcement of Deutsche's final
results, could end up dealing in bank shares during the closed season. Consequently,
DMG will be forced to pay some former Deutsche staff their bonuses in cash.
Adding insult to injury, former Morgan Grenfell staff, unaffected by the
changes, will receive their bonus payment on March 6, nine days earlier
than Deutsche staff. <BR>
<BR>
Although it wasn't a record, 1995 was a bumper year for Wall Street firms.
The second half of the year saw huge returns in equities and M&amp;A, while
returns from fixed-income trading began to pick up in the final quarter.
Smiles were broadest at Goldman Sachs, where 1995 proved a relief after
the trauma of 1994. Sentiments were mixed at Morgan Stanley and Salomon
Brothers, while staff at Lehman and Merrill Lynch are the most likely to
be drowning their sorrows on bonus day. <BR>
<BR>
There will be a large discrepancy between bonus increases for top management
and those awarded to more lowly staff. &quot;We've seen increases of between
30% to 40% for the high flyers, but only 5% to 10% for the processors,&quot;
says Joan Zimmerman, an executive vice-president at recruitment consultancy
GZ Stephens. <BR>
<BR>
Fearless traders were kept in check by fearful managers, imposing stricter
risk management regimes. Traders are being charged for the inventories of
stocks and bonds they keep on the firm's books, with the risks incurred
factored into individual profit and loss accounts. <BR>
<BR>
The move towards awarding a bigger share of bonuses in stocks and stock
options will continue this year. More and more firms require their senior
staff to hold a minimum amount of stock. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Despite the declining tax advantages of awarding bonuses in the form
of stock, it's seen as way of ensuring the loyalty of staff,&quot; says
Raphael Soifer, banking analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
<BR>
<BR>
But for many staff, time spent at a bank remains a dash for cash, with no
loyalty and no long-term perspective. &quot;Banks have toyed with the notion
of adjusting for risk and volatility, but most still opt for the easy option
of paying bonuses purely on the basis of return,&quot; says Mark Rodrigues,
a principal at AMS Management in London. <BR>
<BR>
Rodrigues refers to this as &quot;the Forrest Gump phenomenon&quot;. The
scriptwriters of Forrest Gump, Eric Roth and Ernest Thompson, agreed a cut
of the net revenue generated by the film, while leading man Tom Hanks negotiated
a cut of gross revenue. But the studio claimed that the film made no net
return, limiting the scriptwriters' payment to a $100,000 advance. Meanwhile,
Hanks pocketed tens of millions of dollars for his work on the film. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Banks should follow the example of the studio and pay a performance
bonus out of net returns, including an estimate of risks incurred,&quot;
concludes Rodrigues. <BR>

<H3>EVENT RISK </H3>
<H2>Hanson provokes bondholders </H2>
Bond investors in the industrial conglomerate Hanson plc recently learned
the meaning of event risk - a half-forgotten term dating from the buyout
binge in the late 1980s - when at the end of January the group announced
a demerger designed to split it into four parts. Worried about the credit
quality of the demerged entities, investors sharply marked down the price
of Hanson bonds. As a result, spreads over UK gilts widened by some 30 basis
points (bp). <BR>
<BR>
Event risk is a technical term describing a situation in which the credit
rating of a corporate bond is affected - generally downwards - by an unforeseen
special event, such as a takeover, restructuring or demerger. It first came
to prominence nearly a decade ago during the US leveraged buyout boom, when
bondholders complained bitterly about deals in which companies were either
taken over by highly-leveraged vehicles or were forced to assume leverage
themselves as part of restructuring plans in order to shore up their defence.
<BR>
<BR>
Hanson bondholders were particularly concerned by the company's announcement
that the bond obligations of Hanson plc would remain with the rump Hanson
group after the demerger, while leaving open the question of allocating
the bank debt. This, it said, would depend on the cashflow characteristics
of the new companies. &quot;Bond investors hate uncertainty,&quot; says
Shira Cornwall, head of bond research at BZW. &quot;This has left a lot
of unanswered questions.&quot; Investors were also worried about the fundamental
creditworthiness of the new Hanson, which will contain construction and
aggregates businesses, as well as the group's regional electricity interests.
This makes it a far more cyclical business than the existing Hanson group
and therefore likely to be accorded a lower credit rating. <BR>
<BR>
The Hanson demerger is just one of a number of corporate deals in recent
months which have left bondholders grumbling about their interests being
sacrificed for those of shareholders. Granada's highly-leveraged takeover
of Forte was one bugbear, causing bonds in the latter to be downgraded and
spreads to widen from pre-bid levels of 85bp to around 140bp now. Another
was the fall last autumn in the prices of many regional electricity company
(REC) bonds, prompted by a wave of bids in the summer from lower-rated US
utilities. <BR>
<BR>
Now investors are beginning to take defensive action. Following the Hanson
announcement, prices fell in the bonds of what the market perceived to be
&quot;unbundling&quot; candidates - conglomerates such as BAT Industries,
Pearson and Grand Metropolitan - as institutions switched their funds into
safer areas such as financials and debentures. &quot;Event risk is definitely
coming back as an issue for investors,&quot; says Martin Wade, a fixed-income
fund manager at Sun Life of Canada. <BR>
<BR>
The market's current bout of jitters is much more marked than it was in
the late 1980s, largely because of the recent growth of the sterling bond
market. Since 1990, when the UK's decision to join the ERM encouraged international
investors into the market, new issues have soared. In addition, falling
interest rates and the economic upturn emboldened investors to open the
market to issuers of lower credit quality, attracted by the prospect of
higher yielding paper. Some are now ruing their former enthusiasm. <BR>
<BR>
Investors first woke up to event risk at the end of 1994 when the engineering
and construction conglomerate Trafalgar House launched a bid for Northern
Electric. &quot;This alerted the market to the attractions of a cash-generative
utility to a lower-rated corporate,&quot; says Andy Evans, head of bond
research at SBC Warburg. Trafalgar House was ultimately beaten off by Northern
Electric, but only at the cost of a scorched earth bid defence which substantially
increased the company's debt. This, says Evans, &quot;indicated the extent
to which utility companies could release value to shareholders to the detriment
of credit quality&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Other deals followed in the REC sector, including a series of bids from
lower-rated US utilities. The net result was that spreads in the sector
widened to take into account the possible downgrading of typically AA-rated
utilities to single-A range. <BR>
<BR>
Now, investors are beginning to demand that tighter covenants be built into
bond agreements in order to give them better protection against event risk.
<BR>
<BR>
They are uncomfortably aware that in recent years bond covenants have been
pared away by hard-nosed issuers, giving companies pretty much unfettered
freedom of action to leverage themselves and undertake what restructurings
they see fit without giving bondholders a cash exit. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's been a function of supply and demand,&quot; says Sun Life's Wade.
&quot;There has been growing demand for sterling bonds - lots of funds chasing
limited opportunities - enabling companies to issue bonds with extremely
limited covenants.&quot; This was particularly true in Hanson's case. &quot;Basically,
the company was free to do what it liked,&quot; moans one investor. <BR>
<BR>
But what covenants to ask for? Warburg's Evans is unconvinced that there
is much investors can do to increase their own protection. &quot;If you
look at the classical covenants, specifying gearing and interest cover,
these are generally so undemanding as to offer investors little real cover,&quot;
he says. &quot;The other mainstay, which makes it a puttable event if a
bond issue falls below investment grade, may be of value if you're dealing
with a single A credit, but with higher-rated companies, you've already
lost so much by the time you get to put your bond back to the issuer that
it hardly offers real protection.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He may well be right, but investors are beginning to reward companies which
offer tighter covenants. A recent 10-year &#163;100 million issue by the
AA-rated REC, East Midlands Electricity (EME), contains two covenants designed
to deal with event risk. The first makes it a puttable event should an acquirer
take over the company and transfer the electricity licence from EME to itself
- a covenant pioneered by another REC, SWALEC, in a 20-year deal launched
last year. The second ring-fences the electricity company, to prevent a
new owner from stripping out EME's retained earnings. <BR>
<BR>
Analysts are sceptical about the value of these covenants but investors
seem to like them. The EME issue, led by SBC Warburg, was launched at a
spread of 67bp over the relevant gilt, broadly in line with where the better-rated
credits in the sector, Yorkshire Electricity and London Electricity, were
trading. &quot;There was no need to offer a price incentive,&quot; says
a Warburg spokesman. The market reacted favourably to the deal. <BR>
<BR>
The EME issue may well provide a pointer for the future, at least while
the current wave of restructurings in the UK equity market continues. &quot;I
think you will see investors getting tougher and tougher on covenants in
future,&quot; says one fund manager. <BR>

<H3>CONVERTIBLE BONDS </H3>
<H2>Borrowers' market </H2>
For months, investment banks have been pleading with corporate borrowers
to consider the Euroconvertible bond market. Conditions for issuers have
rarely been so favourable. Falling interest rates allow borrowers to lock
in record-low fixed-rate coupons and fund well below government borrowing
levels. With equity markets at or near all-time highs, issuers can also
be aggressive in setting conversion premia at implied share prices way above
where they could hope to sell new equity. <BR>
<BR>
Above all, convertible bonds are in scarce supply. In 1993 and 1994 many
specialist convertible bond funds were established in France and the UK.
Neither these, nor other traditional institutional and retail buyers of
convertibles have had much opportunity to invest recently. &quot;Many UK
companies sold convertibles in 1993. They have had to wait three years before
returning to the market,&quot; says Rupert Hume Kendall, equity syndicate
manager at UBS. This is because of limits on the amount of equity capital
UK companies can issue without either special shareholder approval or offering
pre-emption rights to existing shareholders. A rule of thumb in Euroconvertibles
is that a regular issuer is one which comes to the market every three or
four years. <BR>
<BR>
Many outstanding Euro-convertible bonds are approaching maturity. Others
are now so far in- or out-of-the-money on the equity component that they
are trading in the secondary market either like simple bonds or like pure
equity. <BR>
<BR>
In February UBS re-opened the sterling Euroconvertible primary market with
a 10-year &#163;260 million ($395 million) deal for airport services group
BAA. Demand was so overwhelming that UBS closed its book of orders after
just one-and-a-half hours. The bonds traded up to 102% of issue price in
the secondary market, despite offering a coupon of just 5.75% and a high
conversion premium of 17.9%. The coupon does offer a pick-up over the 2%
dividend yield on the company's shares. Nevertheless the AA-rated company
is borrowing at 200 basis points (bp) cheaper than the UK government. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Investors are desperate for newly-issued convertible bonds launched
at a decent premium, offering some yield in a low interest rate environment,&quot;
agrees Beno&icirc;t Bout, equity syndicate manager at Banque Indosuez in
Paris. &quot;We and other investment banks are talking weekly to candidate
issuers.&quot; Last month, continental European companies finally heeded
the call. In France, water utility Lyonnaise des Eaux launched a ffr3 billion
($595 million) deal, closely followed by media group Havas with a ffr3.9
billion issue. That's two deals in two weeks compared with just three French
convertibles of any size during the whole of 1995. Both deals were well
placed, with French and British fund managers and Swiss retail investors
prominent. <BR>
<BR>
Unconverted French convertibles are redeemed at a premium to issue price.
This guarantees investors a decent yield to maturity, even if the company's
share price doesn't rise to make conversion worthwhile. The Lyonnaise des
Eaux bonds carry a coupon of 4% with a conversion premium of 13.8% to the
share price at launch. That coupon is a shade higher than the 3.8% dividend
yield on the company's shares. But the redemption formula guarantees an
annual yield to maturity of 5.65%. That, plus strong name recognition, particularly
attracts Swiss retail investors. Even with that yield to maturity, the company
is borrowing at 65bp lower than the French government. Bankers say that
French borrowers can lock in costs of between 50bp and 90bp below French
government bond yields and that attractive growth companies might command
conversion premia in the high teens. <BR>
<BR>
Some potential issuers are holding back due to concerns over their gearing
- convertibles count as debt, not equity - either because their shares trade
on high dividend yields, so convertible buyers will require high coupons,
or because they fear shareholders will disapprove of potentially dilutive
convertible deals. Other issuers are waiting for conditions to be perfect.
&quot;Some leading French companies have just announced weak earnings,&quot;
says one banker. &quot;So even though share prices are high, they would
prefer their convertible issues to coincide with some good news and may
wait until after their half-year results.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Bankers are now knocking on the doors of Total, G&eacute;n&eacute;rale des
Eaux, LVMH and Accor hoping to persuade them to follow. In the UK, any FT-SE
company with moderate gearing of between 25% and 40% and a dividend yield
of under 5% is now in the gunsights of mandate-hunting bankers. There are
still hopes that the Italian government will launch a bond exchangeable
into shares of electricity utility INA. Swiss corporates are also candidates
to issue. Bankers say that European companies could issue dollar-denominated
convertibles and achieve spectacularly low coupons. Competition is fierce,
as reflected in the 2% fee on the BAA deal, lower than the normal 2.5% for
convertible bonds. Meanwhile Asian capital markets are enjoying a convertible
bond binge of their own. <BR>
<BR>
Recent deals have shown that a wide range of international buyers will now
take up Euroconvertible bonds. These include specialist convertible funds;
equity funds with certain income targets; retail investors; large dedicated
bond funds in France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland which cannot buy equity
but which use convertibles as a speculative addition to their portfolios;
and hedge funds which buy convertibles and sell equity. BAA also sold a
hefty portion of its deal in the US. <BR>
<BR>
It would be fanciful however to expect convertible bonds to start appearing
as frequently as conventional bonds. &quot;This is not a commodity product,&quot;
warns Hume Kendall. &quot;It is demand-driven.&quot; <BR>
<BR>

<H3>ASIAN CONVERTIBLE BONDS </H3>
<H2>Return of the Asian issuers </H2>
The Asian convertible bond (CB) bonanza is back, with new issue volume predicted
to be in excess of $3 billion for the first quarter of 1996. A total of
54 Asian corporations issued only $3.43 billion in CBs during 1995, largely
because of poorly performing regional bourses and an uncertain interest
rate environment. Investment bankers are now predicting a return to the
primary market glut of 1993 and early 1994, when $12 billion of Asian convertible
paper hit the market. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The market is about to explode,&quot; says Carson Cole, head of convertible
research at UBS Securities in Singapore. &quot;There is an almost limitless
supply of large Asian corporations with very aggressive expansion plans
which, mainly for reasons of credit, are denied access to the international
straight debt markets. In an environment of very low interest rates and
bullish regional stock markets, convertibles offer the easiest route and
lowest cost of funds for most of these companies.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
With echoes of the 1993 boom, when Morgan Stanley opened up the Asian convertible
market with a $402.5 million issue for Wharf Capital, Hong Kong has again
got the ball rolling. A $130 million exchangeable deal for property group
Paliburg Holdings was jointly led by Jardine Fleming and UBS in late January
and was quickly followed in early February by a five-year $175 million issue
for Sino Land led by Jardine Fleming. <BR>
<BR>
Investors will be hoping that the comparisons with 1993 stop here. Emboldened
by regional stock market gains of over 100% in that year, corporate financiers
fell over themselves in efforts to bring Asian CBs to the market. &quot;No
attention was paid to the needs of the investment community. Credit concerns
were non-existent with the result that a number of dubious names entered
the market. And by early 1994, when interest rates began their rise, pricing
had become farcical,&quot; says the director for international equity syndication
at one US investment bank in Hong Kong. <BR>
<BR>
Aware of their poor track record, investment bankers are keen to stress
that things will be different this time and that the market is more mature.
&quot;You will only be seeing quality names, and deals are being much more
carefully structured,&quot; says Colin Hermon, director of capital markets
at Jardine Fleming. &quot;Competition for mandates is as fierce as ever
but there is an all-round awareness that a more level-headed approach is
required.&quot; The blue chip standing of issuers including Indonesia's
Indocement (which road-showed a $150 million transaction led by Morgan Stanley
in mid-February) and Taiwan's Winbond (which offered a $250 million CB jointly
led by Salomon Brothers and SBC Warburg) suggests that close attention is
indeed being paid to the calibre of borrowers. <BR>
<BR>
Bankers note the emergence of a more sophisticated investor base. &quot;Previously
there was a feeling that anything with an Asian name would fly,&quot; says
the US syndicate chief. &quot;But after two years of tight markets and a
greater familiarity with Asian products, we know that investors will be
more selective.&quot; The relatively strong performance of the secondary
CB market in the past year has also provided investors with a series of
benchmarks upon which to judge the new issue market. &quot;We continued
to champion Asian convertibles throughout 1995,&quot; says Cole, &quot;because
they appeared unusually cheap relative to share valuations. Most convertible
issues had little room to fall further because their yields were high enough
to attract fixed-income investors, and a substantial drop in US interest
rates further increased convertible valuations.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Hong Kong issues recorded the best absolute performance, increasing by an
average of 14.8% in 1995. And the best relative performer was India, where
convertibles rose 2.4%, while their underlying shares fell 38.7%. &quot;An
increasing number of fixed-income buyers were buying the issues which have
been at high yields, regardless of the fact that their underlying equity
valuations were declining [in 1995]. Even today, the average Euroconvertible
in India is yielding 7.6%, which is 220 basis points (bp) over the 7-year
US Treasury yield,&quot; says a Hong Kong banker. <BR>
<BR>
Early investor reaction to the 1996 crop of Asian CBs has been largely favourable.
The Paliburg issue, which is exchangeable into the shares of group subsidiary
Regal Hotels International, was increased from $125 million to $130 million
because of strong demand and was nearly three times oversubscribed. A $100
million offering for top-rated brokerage house Finance One of Thailand in
early February was also well-received and oversubscribed seven times. The
five-and-a-half year deal was priced at par with a 2% coupon and an 8% conversion
premium. <BR>

<H2>The quiet birth of a new jumbo issuer </H2>
<H4>The French government has found a novel way of paying off its social
security debt - a bond issue that will be paid for out of an earmarked tax.
It's not exactly state-backed but there is an implicit guarantee. It may
prove popular when investors get a clearer idea of the details. Daniel Evans
reports </H4>
Cades. Heard of it? You will have soon. By the middle of this year, Cades
is set to become one of the biggest French issuers of international bonds.
&quot;It's going to be the best credit in France after the government,&quot;
reckons Arnaud Gremont, an executive director at Morgan Stanley. <BR>
<BR>
For an organization that plans to raise up to Ffr140 billion ($27 billion)
in syndicated loans and bonds this year, Cades has a remarkably low profile.
Standard &amp; Poor's has no rating for it; Moody's has never heard of it.
The switchboard at the French treasury says it doesn't exist, even though
the treasury is responsible for setting it up. <BR>
<BR>
The Caisse d'Amortissement de la Dette Sociale<I> </I>(Cades - pronounced
<I>Kad-ess</I>) is part of a package of measures introduced by the French
government to eradicate the increasingly unwieldy social security debt.
Spending cuts will reduce future borrowing and Cades will take on what has
already been spent: the deficit accumulated since 1994 (approximately Ffr60
billion a year) and that projected for 1996 (Ffr17 billion). It aims to
pay this off within 13 years. So far the money has been raised in the form
of a Ffr140 billion loan from the Caisse des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts et Consignations,
due June 28. This month, Cades is expected to announce the timetable for
refinancing this debt through a combination of syndicated loans and bond
issues. <BR>
<BR>
A corollary of Cades is a new tax, the <I>remboursement de la dette sociale</I>.
Pegged at 0.5% of virtually all revenues, it will be levied alongside current
social security contributions until the debt is repaid. Half the revenues
from the tax will be used to meet Cades's interest and redemption payments
over the next 13 years. The other half will repay the debt accrued between
1990 and 1993. <BR>
<BR>
Cades will not have an explicit guarantee from the state. Instead, its financial
situation will be regulated by parliament, though it is unclear precisely
what responsibility the legislature will have. Cades's board of six is appointed
by decree, five of the members being acting civil servants from the ministries
of finance and social security. The board's president is to be a &quot;professional&quot;
- &quot;a person with a track record in bond issues,&quot; says an adviser
at the French treasury. Even though there is no formal guarantee, this degree
of official supervision should make it easier for Cades to raise money.
&quot;The relationship and the strong links between Cades and the state
are attractive to investors,&quot; says Henri Kuppers, head of new issues
at the Caisse Nationale de Cr&eacute;dit Agricole. &quot;The fact that parliament
is charged with maintaining its financial stability is a big plus.&quot;
The government has been careful to make the guarantee issue implicit. As
one banker says: &quot;Whether it is written or carved in stone doesn't
really matter - the issue <I>is</I> associated with the government.&quot;
The lack of guarantee means that Cades will have to offer wider spreads.
This, together with the strong state backing, Kuppers says, is likely to
ensure that investors regard Cades bonds almost as &quot;OATs [French government
bonds] with a small margin&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
However, there are potential problems. Finding the large amounts Cades requires
may not be easy this year. There are already a large number of French triple-A
issuers and the government itself will be looking for Ffr520 billion for
its OAT and BTAN [short-term government bond] programmes. Some are cautious,
one banker says that while the market &quot;can absorb Ffr30 billion to
Ffr40 billion, anything above that is more difficult&quot;. Others are more
optimistic but stress that timing will be crucial. &quot;The domestic market
<I>could</I> absorb between Ffr50 billion and Ffr70 billion,&quot; says
Arnaud Gremont at Morgan Stanley, &quot;but only spread over the year, not
in one shot.&quot; Should the bond issues run into problems, the amount
raised through syndicated loans (which many estimate at between Ffr50 billion
and Ffr75 billion) will probably rise. <BR>
<BR>
It is hard to predict Cades's precise impact. Repeated delays in the announcement
of the Cades timetable have done nothing to reduce uncertainty. For example,
board members were still unnamed at the end of March. Indeed, until the
formal decree is published, Cades does not even technically exist - the
money raised so far has been borrowed in the name of Acoss, an agency of
the French social security system. The French treasury has been secretive
throughout, making an accurate assessment difficult. &quot;We still know
practically nothing,&quot; says Bruno de Pamplone, head of debt at Merrill
Lynch in Paris. &quot;We have so little information - we don't know the
proportion of bonds, the proportion of loans, whether there will be a lot
of foreign currency or none at all.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Why has the announcement of the programme been so delayed? The treasury's
indecisiveness has clearly frustrated many observers. It informally consulted
around 25 banks and primary dealers (SVTs) at the start of February, asking
for suggestions. &quot;Since then,&quot; says Morgan Stanley's Gremont,
&quot;the French treasury has essentially kept very quiet&quot;. The flow
of opinions would appear to be strictly one-way. &quot;The treasury is now
just thinking it over and over,&quot; says Christophe Duval Kieffer, economist
at Banque Indosuez, &quot;they are not keen on answering questions.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Most observers - and the treasury - ascribe the delay to bureaucratic procedure.
&quot;It's nothing to do with the market,&quot; says de Pamplone of Merrill
Lynch. &quot;This is a complex <I>dossier</I> with many political implications.
A big reform takes a bit of time.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Cr&eacute;dit Agricole's Kuppers agrees, noting that &quot;securing the
agreement of parliament has taken a little longer [than expected]&quot;.
Most of the paperwork is now complete and a senior treasury adviser confirms
that &quot;things will now happen as quickly as possible - very quickly
indeed&quot;. One possible timetable is as follows. Assuming the board is
named at the beginning of this month and has its first meeting a couple
of weeks later, as many expect, &quot;they may even come to the market as
soon as the end of the month [April]&quot;, Gremont says. The situation
is still very uncertain though. Jean Arthuis, French finance minister, announced
just last month that the first issue would be &quot;very soon&quot;, only
to have his remarks clarified by the treasury the next day. &quot;Soon&quot;,
it seems, does not mean the same for bureaucrats as it does for politicians.
<BR>
<BR>
Whatever its origins, the delay has not been to Cades's advantage. Left
so long in the dark, some bankers are beginning to have doubts. &quot;Three
or four months ago I would have said it was going to be a great success,&quot;
says Duval Kieffer. Now, however, &quot;people seem less confident in French
Eurobonds&quot;. The decline in confidence is partly because of the turbulence
in the market over the last couple of months which has seen many spreads
suffer. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Foreign disenchantment</B> <BR>
<BR>
The underlying trend may be even more worrying. Foreign investors are relatively
uninterested in French franc bonds at present levels. &quot;The spread [over
German Bunds] is too narrow in any paper,&quot; explains one portfolio manager
at Deutsche Bank. &quot;Many international funds would sell, but they can't.&quot;
Some international funds are finding the French franc market as a whole
expensive. &quot;Foreign investors are currently holding very few French
bonds in their portfolios,&quot; says Eric Muller, chief economist at Cr&eacute;dit
Commercial de France. He estimates that the foreign share of French government
debt (OATs and BTANs) may be as low as 18%. Foreign portfolios are generally
underexposed in other state-backed and public-sector securities. &quot;Most
international funds preferred liquidity in 1995, especially with the tightening
of spreads,&quot; Muller says. Many found the Bund/OAT spread tight even
at 40bp or 50bp. At 20bp as <I>Euromoney</I> went to press, it is tighter
still. Demand in the market has been almost entirely sustained by domestic
investors, in particular insurance companies. <BR>
<BR>
Other concerns, more specific to Cades, are perhaps more damaging in the
long term. Many are unhappy that the government has not given Cades an explicit
guarantee. It has instead chosen to hand over the debt to a separate agency,
albeit one with implicit state backing. &quot;This kind of funny accounting,&quot;
says a foreign banker, &quot;is very much the typical French way of doing
things.&quot; But why set up a separate body to deal with the debt in the
first place? Several reasons have been put forward, the most cynical that
the government wishes to get Ffr140 billion off its hands. However, as Morgan
Stanley's Gremont points out, &quot;the social security system has never
been a French state problem. It has always been managed <I>outside</I> the
state.&quot; A useful technicality when the sums involved are so large.
<BR>
<BR>
Another reason has more to do with the politics of taxation. By separating
out the debt in this way the government is drawing attention to the problems
in welfare funding and making the repayment of the social security debt
an issue of collective responsibility. The existence of Cades means taxpayers
will see exactly where their money goes. &quot;It is important in order
to justify the new taxes,&quot; says Olivier Rousseau, head of origination
for French issuers at BNP. The government wants the problem to be self-regulating.
In this context the lack of guarantee is intended as &quot;a strong signal
to the social security organizations&quot;, says Duval Kieffer at Indosuez,
a signal warning them to &quot;avoid future deficits&quot;. In market terms,
though, the lack of a guarantee makes the paper &quot;much less interesting
to investors&quot;, says Marc Schaeffer, a portfolio manager at Cr&eacute;dit
Mutuel. <BR>
<BR>
With only an implicit guarantee, Cades may also suffer from investors' wider
disenchantment with French quasi-state and public-sector securities. According
to a portfolio manager at Deutsche Bank, international investors &quot;have
been left with a bad image, a suspicion of quasi-state [issuers]&quot; after
Cr&eacute;dit Foncier had its rating downgraded and the spreads on its debt
of over Ffr200 billion widened from 20bp over OATs to as much as 200bp.
&quot;Important funds that were long in Cr&eacute;dit Foncier&quot; have
had their fingers burnt, says the fund manager, and are &quot;now careful
with state-associated names. Even in other currencies it might be very difficult
to place abroad&quot;. The portfolio manager stresses that the connection
between Cades and Cr&eacute;dit Foncier is &quot;illogical&quot; given their
different set-ups, but he argues that it is a connection that buyers may
perceive. Cades is an establishment of public administration, while Cr&eacute;dit
Foncier is a specialized finance institution, a private bank whose governors
are appointed by the state. However the distinction for those not completely
<I>au fait</I> with the arcane legal niceties of French public finance may
be a slender one. As one banker acknowledges, for foreigners the state and
semi-state sector &quot;can seem at times like French porridge&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Gremont believes that &quot;investors who understand [how Cades works] feel
extremely comfortable&quot;. Cades is unlikely to face the same problems
as Cr&eacute;dit Foncier or Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais for example. It is not
involved in business or property, the root of the current banking crisis.
It will simply collect taxes and service debt. &quot;From the investors'
standpoint it is simple to understand, much simpler than business, it is
just a cashflow,&quot; believes Gremont. Nevertheless confusion does exist.
&quot;There is a problem with the transparency of the name,&quot; says an
international portfolio manager. If the issue is to be a success with international
investors the government will have to do a better job on publicity than
it has managed up to now. The role of the bookrunners will be important,
believes Cr&eacute;dit Agricole's Kuppers. &quot;They will have to roadshow
it,&quot; says Gremont. <BR>
<BR>
However, even domestic investors may be concerned by recent economic indicators
which suggest the new tax may prove a less secure financial base for Cades
than expected. The treasury estimates that revenues will be around Ffr25
billion this year. Some believe this target will not be reached. Duval Kieffer
of Indosuez considers that &quot;investors in general are doubtful about
the amount budgeted and with reason&quot;. With projected GDP growth &quot;slower
than expected&quot; and potentially as low as 1% to 1.3%, what the treasury
believes will be raised looks &quot;generous, if not optimistic&quot;. Others
point out that there is still some room for manoeuvre; Cades will take priority
over other borrowing when tax revenue is shared out. <BR>
<BR>
There are also concerns that Cades may have to borrow more. The Ffr17 billion
budgeted for this year's social security deficit will be &quot;substantially
surpassed&quot;, believes Indosuez's Duval Kieffer. This means that the
current estimate of borrowing, Ffr147 billion, &quot;will have to be revised
upwards&quot;, possibly by as much as Ffr8 billion to Ffr10 billion. This
raises the question of what will happen if future deficits continue to be
large. The treasury has not given any clear indications to the market. &quot;They
didn't really talk about that, I don't think anything clear has been decided,&quot;
says a banker, &quot;I think they are aiming for close to a wipe-out.&quot;
A treasury adviser says that Cades is &quot;ring-fenced&quot;, the government
will deal with deficits after 1996 if and when they occur. However, some
investors are clearly worried, one fears that financing welfare debt could
prove a &quot;bottomless cup&quot;, though concedes this is unlikely. A
lot will hinge on the credibility of the government's austerity measures.
Investors will be looking carefully for evidence of a dramatic reduction
in spending. A Cades 2 is a prospect the market does not relish. <BR>
<BR>
In general, though, the investment community is optimistic. International
demand may be doubtful, but many domestic investors are looking forward
to the issue. &quot;The market is ready,&quot; confirms Arnaud Serougne,
head of the long-term desk at Compagnie Bancaire. &quot;We have known the
sums involved for some time now&quot;. The delays do not appear to have
dampened enthusiasm too much. Cr&eacute;dit Agricole's Kuppers considers
that &quot;the market will welcome [Cades], it has been waiting for it for
some time - almost six months&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
<B>All about the spread</B> <BR>
<BR>
The way Cades is received will ultimately depend on its pricing. Duval Kieffer
acknowledges that the market has sufficient depth to absorb the volumes
Cades is seeking but emphasizes that this must be in the right context,
with &quot;the right maturities and the right interest rates - a spread
more generous than OATs&quot;, possibly by as much as 25bp. One fund manager
said that while some of his clients &quot;believe 12bp to 15bp is good,
others think that over 20bp is not enough&quot;. They may be disappointed.
Straight government-guaranteed bonds generally trade at between 3bp and
8bp above OATs, public-sector company bonds (EDF or SNCF, for example) at
between 10bp and 20bp. Cades will probably fall in between, even without
a government guarantee. As Muller of Cr&eacute;dit Commercial de France
points out, &quot;the fact that it is backed [by a tax] offers enormous
security&quot;. In some ways its future is more secure than that of the
utilities, it is in no danger of being privatized, for instance. <BR>
<BR>
The numbers involved may force the spread higher than this though. &quot;The
size of the transactions are maybe a little too much for the market,&quot;
says Gremont of Morgan Stanley, &quot;so the Cades may have to pay a little
bit more than the theoretical rate.&quot; On the other hand the size of
the issues may actually count in Cades's favour when it comes to pricing.
The liquidity they guarantee will be attractive to investors. <BR>
<BR>
Patrick Artus, head of economic studies at Caisse des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts
et Consignations, believes that banks that already have large holdings of
OATs and BTANs are likely to show a strong interest. He thinks Cades is
likely to issue what the market wants, pointing out that &quot;life assurers
and savings funds are currently looking for longer maturities. They are
buying nothing but bonds.&quot; Cades is likely to ensure that &quot;the
issues match demand&quot;. Indeed, the treasury is understood to have already
&quot;prepared&quot; the main buyers in the insurance market in order to
find out. A senior treasury adviser has no doubt that demand will be high
- &quot;the SVTs [primary dealers] have all responded positively, the demand
is there&quot;. Treasury studies have indicated that the &quot;issue is
eagerly awaited&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The arrival of Cades will certainly have an important effect on state and
public-sector securities. &quot;It will accentuate the selective side of
the market&quot; says Serougne, &quot;competition will be sharper&quot;.
Cades may attract investment that would otherwise have gone elsewhere. Bruno
Lescoeur, deputy head of finance at EDF, one of the largest triple A public
borrowers, concedes that &quot;Cades will represent a competitor&quot; but
is largely unworried, French franc issues represent only a fifth of total
borrowing. The public-sector issuers' perspective is &quot;vigilant rather
than worried&quot;, confirms Jacques Gibert, head of finance at SNCF. He
acknowledges though that &quot;we will have to be flexible and reactive&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
The prospect of competition may already have jolted some into action. Kuppers
believes that &quot;we have seen a number of issuers hurry to get in ahead
of Cades&quot;. Cr&eacute;dit Local, for instance, by far the largest French
issuer, has already floated Ffr2 billion. An official there thinks it &quot;unlikely&quot;
that it will come back to francs for the rest of the year. <BR>
<BR>
Should Cades paper prove popular, the treasury may find it has established
a rival to its OAT programme. Serougne suggests there is a possibility that
Cades paper &quot;will be preferred to OATs&quot;. In portfolios with a
set percentage allocated to state-backed debt, managers may choose to drop
government bonds in favour of the wider spread Cades is expected to offer.
This situation could arise if investors consider that Cades bonds &quot;are
practically OATs&quot;, says Schaeffer, the portfolio manager at Cr&eacute;dit
Mutuel. <BR>
<BR>
This possibility can, however, be overstated. Investors may well take Cades
paper in addition to their current positions, rather than switching. &quot;I
am not sure we will see an eviction effect,&quot; says Muller, &quot;investors
may see this as an opportunity to add a name with a high level of security.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The success of Cades will be decided by how flexible it is. Given the amount
to be raised, most observers expect a blend of currencies and maturities,
with around half the total funded through syndicated loans. Cades may well
prefer to borrow short rather than risk overloading the issue programme.
&quot;They will not be hurried, the issues will reflect the position of
the market,&quot; believes Rousseau at BNP. <BR>
<BR>
However, political considerations may restrict its options and make it difficult
for Cades to finance the debt as cheaply as it would like. Some people are
uncomfortable with the use of foreign-currency issues to settle what they
consider a domestic problem. While the Ecu market may offer some possibilities,
other choices may prove more controversial. &quot;It would look a bit strange
if they issued in Deutschmarks or yen to fund the social security deficit,&quot;
comments an analyst at one investment bank. Others are more sanguine and
see the currency issue as &quot;neutral&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The Jupp&eacute; government has a lot invested (both financially and symbolically)
in the success of its social security debt programme. Last November the
prime minister declared that the establishment of Cades and its tax would
bring &quot;a new legitimacy to our welfare system&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Domestic demand is probably assured, international investors will no doubt
wait a while longer before committing themselves. Whatever the outcome,
further delays in the programme will be unlikely to increase investor confidence.
When the sums involved are so large, bankers want details, and soon. &quot;It
is effectively a very large sum - announced as a straight figure, Ffr140
billion can seem alarming,&quot; concedes Muller of Cr&eacute;dit Commercial
de France. &quot;However, the multiplicity of tools and options available
to finance the debt means that it will be far more easily absorbed than
foreign investors fear.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Some bankers, such as de Pamplone at Merrill Lynch, are even more confident.
&quot;It's only Ffr140 billion,&quot; he points out laconically, &quot;it's
not difficult to raise that kind of money internationally.&quot; <p>

<H3>REVIEW</H3> 
<H2>Varied as a kilim </H2>
<H4>Dervish: The Invention of Modern Turkey </H4>
<I>By Tim Kelsey<BR>
Hamish Hamilton, &#163;18 <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reviewed by Davina Cameron</B></I><B> </B><BR>
<BR>
After more than 70 years of a secular government, Turkey is currently facing
the possibility of a fundamentalist Islamic party holding office. Such a
dichotomy is, according to Kelsey, entirely in keeping with its recent history.
Turkey is a country which sits uneasily with the one-nation secular state
Kemal Attaturk imposed in the '20s in an attempt to modernise and westernise
it. Lying at the crossroads of east and west, it has become a melting pot
of nationalities, religions and cultures and, for all Attaturk's attempts
to create a new, westward-looking country, this old, more diverse Turkey
has refused to die. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Arabesk&quot; music, a symbol of the old Turkey and once banned by
officials for its tragic appeal, &quot;lives on and prospers&quot;. Its
romantic lyricism contrasts starkly with Ankara, the grey and artificial
city Attaturk promoted as the new capital. This antagonism between old and
new conceals a mass of tensions beneath a surface culture created and fostered
by the bureaucrats, rendered all the more explosive by the state's obstinate
refusal to admit to them. <BR>
<BR>
As one of Kelsey's friends laments in the book: &quot;Attaturk told us we
are all Turks, but we all lived for centuries as different people&quot;.
The author's unstated quest in the book is to find these different people,
the people that Attaturk's state refuse to account for. Through the extraordinary
accounts of his journeys through Turkey and his meetings with these people
- from outlawed dervishes to whorehouse guards and left-wing radicals
- we discover a country as rich and varied as a kilim rug, a complex
network of minority nationalities, cultures, religions and political groups.
<BR>
<BR>
Kelsey has travelled throughout Turkey, from sophisticated Istanbul to the
depths of south east Anatolia and the remote villages hit by the Kurdish
war. Meetings were not always easy to arrange. Kelsey and his companion
faced fear, suspicion and occasional aggression from the bodyguards of heroin
dealers and implacable officials who refused to admit western journalists
even when they brandished government permits. <BR>
<BR>
The number and variety of people they did eventually manage to talk to,
and the frankness of some of the opinions ventured despite the risk to freedom,
reputation and even life, is remarkable. One senior policeman, for example,
admits to Kelsey that he is a fan of banned left-wing poets and musicians
yet keeps a copy of the conservative newspaper on his desk for the benefit
of colleagues. A driver asserts that the fearsome Kurdish fighters of the
PKK &quot;do not kill civilians. They are good people&quot;, yet he fears
death for his words. An archbishop who pays protection money to the PKK
is terrified of the Turkish forces: &quot;The army will burn us.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Kelsey's stories invariably lead into an explanation of the historical backcloth
to the individual being portrayed and the group to which he belongs. While
he is unsentimental to the point of brutality and while his narrative is
undeniably engrossing, the cumulative effect of all this somewhat anecdotal
information does not always make clear his central thesis. <BR>
<BR>
Kelsey's considerable experience as a journalist (he now works for the British
weekly newspaper <I>The Sunday Times</I>) ensures that he has an unerring
eye for detail which will shock, amuse or illustrate a delicate point. Thus
he offers the glimpse of a young prostitute's bedroom, whose only decoration
is a torn poster of poppy fields, or the heroin dealer's assertion that
watermelons brought wealth to his rural village. His years as a journalist
have left their mark in another way: his writing is dominated by short,
almost staccato phrases. They may mirror the nature of what he writes, but
at times one longs for the fluency and fullness of a more connected and
developed argument. <BR>
<BR>
The overall effect of the book is as uneasy as the country itself. What
would have made a enthralling television documentary or series of articles
makes for a confusing book. Until this documentary is made, however, <I>Dervish</I>
will remain one of the most enlightening insights into the country, a must
for travellers wanting to understand the Turkey that lies behind the beaches
and the Blue Mosque.<BR><BR>

<H3>Here be dragons </H3>
<H4>Fire in the Mind: Science, Faith and the Search for Order </H4>
<I>By George Johnson<BR>
Viking, &#163;18.00 <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reviewed by Tony Quinlan </B></I><BR>
<BR>
In his introduction to <I>Fire in the Mind</I>, George Johnson remarks that
while writing this book he found himself in &quot;the wilderness the mapmakers
call terra incognita&quot;. Those same areas were often marked with the
legend &quot;Here be dragons&quot;: these days, he finds the dragons of
20th century science far more formidable than the mythical monster. <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, that science itself may be a modern-day myth is precisely the point
the author has to make. Not that he believes science to be untrue, but rather
that it may not be the path to absolute truth that it so often purports
to be. <BR>
<BR>
Where science and religion overlap is in the need to perceive an order in
everyday reality. Whether Christian, Navajo, Hindu or Islamic, all peoples
have beliefs that reassure them that the world is as it is for a reason.
Creation myths are just one example of these. Indeed, Johnson's description
of particle physics couched in creation-myth terms highlights the similarities
between science and religion. <BR>
<BR>
But the need for such myths arises from mankind's ability to discern patterns,
something familiar to anyone who has seen a face in the random picture of
a tree trunk or overhead cloud. We all share the faith that there is a basic
pattern or simplicity underlying the world, if only we could see it. For
some this faith is represented by religious belief, for others it is manifest
in a constant search for a grand unification theory or definitive statement
of the universe's make-up. <BR>
<BR>
Some justification of this quest is provided in a radical area covered here,
the strange attractors of complexity theory present in systems like the
human genome. Until now they have been seen as random. The speculation that
<I>homo sapiens </I>may not result from random mutations over millions of
years is a giant step away from the Darwinism popular today. <BR>
<BR>
Johnson applies the theory of strange attractors from complexity theory
to the gradual development of more and more sophisticated life forms, arguing
that certain features such as bilateral symmetry (that is to say two legs,
arms, eyes, ears) and a spinal column may be inevitable as time progresses:
&quot;Eyes are not random accumulations of accidents but patterns that arise
'as waves and spirals arise naturally in water' as [James] Goodwin once
put it. Or, to use a more technical term, eyes and other organs are attractors
in a dynamical system.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The most radical concept Johnson presents, however, is that of information.
Not the idea of information as a facet of matter and energy but as a building
block of reality, ranking alongside matter, energy, space and time. He is
clearly attracted to the concept for here he suspends his critical faculties,
preferring instead to opt for lucid but mildly evangelical descriptions
of the new &quot;physics of information&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;To all but the handful of initiates, it sounds impenetrably mysterious,
this notion that information and energy could be somehow intertwined...
one must become submerged in a way of thinking and carving up the world
that has its origins in the late 19th century,&quot; he writes. From there
Johnson begins with Maxwell's imp, a fantastical creature that seems to
out-think the second law of thermodynamics, that entropy will always increase
in an irreversible process. Taking this through probability theory, he argues
that even the demon is deceptive - its intelligence costs energy, preserving
the status quo - never getting something from nothing. This then leads
to discussion of the possibility of information itself being physical, implying
that it is at least as fundamental as matter or energy. <BR>
<BR>
Having so conscientiously pointed out flaws and alternatives to other theories,
it is disappointing that he does not do so here. Given that all current
mainstream science is an alternative argument to this new concept, it may
be that any critique was thought unnecessary. Nevertheless, his ability
to show potential flaws would have served him better. <BR>
<BR>
Even so, by this point readers will have developed the habit of re-examining
suggested theories. His arguments in favour of a new approach to information
are well-argued, if a little shaky in places. For example, the case he makes
for saying that &quot;an ordinary object like a marble has mass, colour,
size&quot; while &quot;an electron is mass, spin, and charge&quot; is more
an argument of semantics than one of physical concepts. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, as science editor of <I>The</I> <I>New York Times</I>, Johnson
is well-placed to lead readers through the outer frontiers of 20th century
science. Covering quantum and particle physics, cosmology, chaos and complexity,
evolution, the creation of life and the physics of information, he lucidly
outlines historical developments and recent thinking, both controversial
and mainstream. <BR>
<BR>
Recent years have seen a glut of science books explaining advances in layman's
terms. Despite the wide-ranging subject matter, however, all have had one
thing in common: in their authors' eyes, the advances were right. Where
Johnson differs is in his insistence on constantly casting doubt on the
fundamental exercise of science. <BR>
<BR>
Ultimately, however, the book succeeds not by providing answers but by laying
out clearly the map scientists currently have of the universe we live in.
By emphasising throughout that the map is not the territory, Johnson reinforces
the notion that while current theories explain behaviour we see today, they
may not continue to do so. Here may well be dragons, but Johnson is arming
us to deal with them. <BR><BR>

<H4>Socialist Unemployment: The Political Economy of Yugoslavia 1945-1990
</H4>
<I>By Susan Woodward<BR>
Princeton University Press, &#163;42.50/$55 <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reviewed by Evan Kraft</B></I><B> </B><BR>
<BR>
Yugoslavia, that large collection of southern Slav peoples which brought
them into complex cooperation until they started fighting each other again
a few years ago, has always been fascinating and unfathomable for observers.
<BR>
<BR>
It has long been a land of complex historical antecedents, extensive ethno-national,
cultural and religious diversity and enormous economic disparities. In this
respect, it is unlucky that it was also the land of self-management, for
any evaluation of that unusual economic model now has to be made within
the context of its complicated history. <BR>
<BR>
Susan Woodward has undertaken this task in her <I>Socialist Unemployment</I>,
providing a rich account of how the self-management system was born, evolved
and ultimately died with Yugoslavia. The model is worth a look, if only
because for a long stretch in the '60s and '70s it was considered a fashionable
&quot;Third Way&quot; alternative to the centralised market economies of
the Soviet bloc and the western free market. <BR>
<BR>
Yugoslav self-management devolved large chunks of economic power to local
authorities but kept the market within defined enclaves, so creating a decentralised
statism. This helped prevent the sort of organisation of labour seen in
western European social democracies and channeled economic and political
energies into fragmented entities, discouraging any all-Yugoslav identity
and encouraging wasteful duplication. <BR>
<BR>
Her study starts from the apparent incongruity of widespread, open unemployment
in a socialist economy. Drawing on studies of European social democracies,
she argues that in the long term unemployment is determined by political
choices about the kind of economic model prefered and the nature of adjustment
to world market changes. <BR>
<BR>
Woodward carefully studies the origins of the model, arguing that the Yugoslavs
laid the foundations of their approach even before the 1948 split of the
maverick communist leader Josef Tito with the Soviet Union. Far from being
devout Stalinists, the Yugoslavs were dedicated to preserving independence
while pursuing a form of socialist development aimed at avoiding the poverty
and dependency of the first, inter-war Yugoslavia. <BR>
<BR>
The author sees self-management as part of the regime's attempt to transfer
responsibility for cost-cutting and efficiency onto the local level, and
in particular onto the workers themselves. It was part and parcel of the
never-ending struggle to satisfy balance of payments constraints in the
postwar era, when the country built up large international debts. <BR>
<BR>
The breakdown of the system is relatively clear as well. By the '80s the
old buffer mechanisms no longer functioned. Migration from the countryside
was no longer easily reversible, the private sector remained too small to
absorb growing numbers of unemployed and after the '70s there was a fall
in demand for <I>Gastarbeite</I> in western Europe, once an important escape
valve for the Yugoslav economic system. The unemployed became increasingly
young, urban and educated. When private lending to eastern Europe shrivelled
in the '80s, the country found itself back with the problems of the '40s:
balance of payments pressure and a lack of reliable external support. <BR>
<BR>
What does all this tell us about self-management and the Yugoslav model?
Woodward disputes the relevance of standard neo-classical models of the
labour-managed firm to the Yugoslav experience. Her explanation of the origins
of self-management suggest that it would be difficult to draw strong conclusions
about the model in general from the weaknesses of Yugoslav firms. <BR>
<BR>
Less clear in this account are the causes of Yugoslavia's economic failings.
Without this it is impossible to understand why the constant struggle to
raise efficiency, so amply chronicled by Woodward, did not give better results.
Problems like low agricultural productivity, high import dependence for
inputs and capital goods and continual excess domestic absorption were never
solved. In addition, soft-budget constraints limited productivity advance,
a factor oddly discounted by Woodward, while political influence over both
investment and banking hampered more effective capital allocation. <BR>
<BR>
Intertwined with these problems was the territorialisation of economic policy.
As Woodward emphasises, with republic and commune governments set up as
key organisers of economic life, resource competition was politicised often
on ethnic lines. Decentralisation did not defuse ethnic conflict; it encouraged
it. The consequences are visible today. <BR>
<BR>
In short, Woodward's work is worthwhile reading both for those seeking to
understand the economics behind the current conflict in former Yugoslavia
and for those interested in knowing whatever happened to self-management
as an economic model. <p>

<H4>Europe faces fundamental change. This survey looks at some of the 
uncertainties. Will the single currency collapse? How will Europe's 
central bank work? And can bureaucrats bridge the gap between 
rich and poor countries? Introduction by Nigel Dudley </H4>
During a recent speech at Louvain University in Belgium, Germany's chancellor
Helmut Kohl warned that the debate about Europe's economic and political
future was nothing short of a &quot;question of war and peace in the 21st
century&quot;. He told his audience that &quot;if there is no momentum for
continued integration, this will not only lead to standstill but also to
retrogression. Nationalism has brought great suffering to our continent;
just think of the first 50 years of this century.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The chancellor has held these views for many years and they have provided
the touchstone for the policy initiatives of the European Union's (EU) most
powerful economic power during Kohl's 15 years in office. By restating them
in such apocalyptic terms, he was demonstrating his determination that his
vision of Europe would be the one to prevail. <BR>
<BR>
But he will not win without a fight. Although a substantial majority of
Europe's governments are in favour of further political and economic integration,
the case for federalism has yet to be accepted by voters, and some governments
remain reluctant to subordinate national interests to those of the EU as
a whole. <BR>
<BR>
Kohl will try to force the pace in coming months as decisions are taken
which will determine the structure of the union for the early years of the
next century. The results are likely to be a further step towards the chancellor's
blueprint for an EU extended to eastern European states, a single currency,
a common foreign policy and enhanced powers for its institutions, including
the European Court and the Parliament. <BR>
<BR>
The precise direction and speed of the changes are harder to predict. The
next three months will be critical as the deadline approaches for crucial
decisions which have to be taken on the single currency and ministers start
to hammer out an agreement on a new Maastricht treaty. <BR>
<BR>
Monetary union has effectively become a battle between political will and
economic reality. In the past year it has become clear that, Luxembourg
aside, few if any countries feel confident of meeting the convergence criteria
for the single currency in time. To do so, governments would have to impose
tough economic medicine by removing social benefits that are regarded as
an inalienable right in much of the community and by cutting state spending,
which could jeopardize Europe's fragile economic recovery from recession.
The issue has been further complicated by the Bundesbank's public insistence
that it would resist any attempt to ease the entry conditions for monetary
union. <BR>
<BR>
Supporters of full monetary union took some comfort from the May assessment
of the European Commission - the most optimistic for some time -
which predicted that Europe's economy would recover sufficiently for seven
countries (Germany, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and Finland,
plus Denmark if it chose to opt in) to meet the criteria. <BR>
<BR>
There will be a political price to pay, though. In Germany, there have been
a series of public sector strikes in reaction to attempts to keep the lid
on wage settlements and France has been brought to a standstill several
times in recent months as workers protested against cuts in social security
and health budgets. <BR>
<BR>
Only a minority will lock their exchange rates and establish a central bank
with sole control over monetary policy by the start of 1999. The failure
of other states to meet the economic conditions has not diminished their
determination to be in the second wave. <BR>
<BR>
Italy, under a new left-of-centre prime minister Romano Prodi; Spain, under
a new right-of-centre prime minister Jos&eacute;-Mar&iacute;a Aznar; and
Belgium, under their long-serving arch federalist Jean-Luc Dehaene, have
proposed measures to make substantial budget cuts in the face of considerable
unpopularity and threats of industrial action. Even Britain, which has an
opt out, is close enough to the targets to be able to join early next century
if it wishes. Other states argue that once a majority of states has achieved
monetary union, Britain will be forced to follow suit. <BR>
<BR>
This more flexible approach to European integration is likely to be one
of the principal elements to emerge from the intergovernmental conference
(IGC) on the next stages forward for the Union. Europe's leaders have spent
several months trying to find a way around Britain's growing intransigence
on EU matters and ensuring that, in Kohl's words, &quot;the convoy does
not go at the speed of the slowest ship&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The idea would be that an inner EU bloc of federalist states could be established.
Alongside them, a second group, possibly consisting of Euro-sceptic states
such as Britain, less efficient economies such as Italy and Spain, and new
members such as Poland and Hungary, could co-exist with the federalist core.
<BR>
<BR>
One of the key battlegrounds of the IGC is likely to be the extent of the
national veto. Germany and France want to extend the number of issues decided
by qualified majority voting - a weighted system that enables a minority
in certain circumstances to block decisions that have majority support.
There will also be calls to bring justice and home affairs under the community
umbrella: at present they are decided intergovernmentally. And there will
be argument over whether the power of the European Court should be extended
or constrained. <BR>
<BR>
One of the most contentious battles will be over proposals to extend the
role of the European Parliament in the way it monitors the activities of
both the Commission and the Council of Ministers. Germany, as the strongest
proponent of a united Europe, and itself a federal country, wants to extend
the supranational control of the parliament. Britain and France argue that
national parliaments should be the real focus of power. <BR>
<BR>
The EU also has to reform the way it conducts its business. It has to adapt
its institutions - initially designed for a community of six -
so they can cope with a membership of more than 20. For example, if the
present system of revolving six-month presidencies were to remain, each
state would hold the post only once every decade. <BR>
<BR>
Policies need to be reformed as well. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
already takes the lion's share of the EU's budget. Unless substantial cuts
are made in the way it operates, the CAP would be put under an intolerable
burden if it had to fund the agricultural economies of eastern Europe. That
will be difficult to achieve as the farm lobby, although an increasingly
small element of the European economy, has been extremely vocal in protecting
its interests and financial support. <BR>
<BR>
There is no doubt that the community will have more members early in the
next century. Cyprus and Malta can be absorbed relatively easily. The problems
come with Turkey and other countries with association agreements. <BR>
<BR>
Turkey, which has upgraded its relationship to a customs union, is unlikely
to be offered full membership for at least 20 years. Its parlous economic
state, large population, dispute with Greece and the European view of its
human rights record ensure considerable opposition to a membership application.
<BR>
<BR>
There have also been membership applications from eastern European states
including the four Visigrad states - Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic
and the Slovak Republic - and other former communist states such as
Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. These states
have already negotiated association agreements with the EU but negotiations
for membership will not start until some unspecified time after the completion
of the IGC and, even then, will take some years. <BR>
<BR>
The strongest support for widening the EU to include eastern Europe comes
from Germany. Its proximity to the former communist bloc has made it very
conscious of the need to bind these states into western democratic structures.
But, if these states joined the EU, which has included Austria, Finland
and Sweden as members since the start of last year, the focus of the union
would change dramatically. The geographical centre, which in the community
of 12 states was Paris, would be moved irrevocably to Berlin. <BR>
<BR>
This has alarmed France and the other southern European countries which
see not only a shift in political focus but also competition for funds redistributed
from the rich member states to the poorer ones. This fear is behind the
desire to boost links between the EU and the Mediterranean states, which
is reflected in the partnership agreement reached in Barcelona last November.
<BR>
<BR>
After two days of negotiations between the EU states, 11 Mediterranean countries
(Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey,
Cyprus and Malta) and the Palestinian Authority, agreement was reached on
developing economic, political and social cooperation. <BR>
<BR>
A free trade area between the 27 states will be completed by the year 2010.
Tariff and non-tariff barriers on manufactured goods will be gradually removed,
and trade in farm products and services will be steadily liberalized. <HR>
<H1><A NAME="fasttrack"></A>The case for the fast track </H1>
<H3>Peter Sutherland, chairman of Goldman Sachs International, puts his
case for deeper political and economic union <BR>
</H3>
I write as an unashamed pro-European. I am deeply and personally convinced
of the need to press forward towards ever greater political and economic
union within Europe. What is more, I believe that further integration is
very much in Britain's interest and Britain's positive involvement is also
in the European Union's interest. <BR>
<BR>
My starting point is that the European Union (EU) and the institutions which
preceded it - the European Coal and Steel Community in 1961 and subsequently,
the EEC - have made an unimaginably positive contribution to the well-being,
security and prosperity of Europe's people. Europe, throughout history a
cockpit of conflict between warring states, has enjoyed decades of unprecedented
peace and prosperity. This is not in spite of the EU's institutions -
but in significant measure because of them. <BR>
<BR>
The EU is now the longest-established and the most successful of the world's
growing number of free trade areas. Britain has played a central role in
promulgating this reality. The EU's exports to the rest of the world are
growing rapidly and the growth in the EU's trade in goods is being matched
by a powerful surge in services, especially financial services. It is simply
inaccurate to present the European economy as being in serious decline or
as a stagnating failure - although, of course, some significant adjustments
to social welfare systems and to labour flexibility are required. <BR>
<BR>
The EU has evolved to the position it enjoys today precisely because individual
nation states have been prepared to share sovereignty. Shared sovereignty
was what the European Community was all about from its inception and European
countries' willingness to share sovereignty has invariably paid dividends
for Europe as a whole. Look at the impotence of the EU where its members
have not created the mechanisms for it to speak with one voice. Europe has
proved itself utterly incapable of dealing with the horrors of war in former
Yugoslavia. <BR>
<BR>
By contrast, the recent Uruguay trade round could not have been concluded
successfully if Europe had not spoken with one voice throughout the protracted
negotiations. The EU, represented exclusively by the Commission, acted as
a vital counterweight to the US and other powerful trading blocs. The resulting
agreement will give a major fillip to world trade: in primary goods alone,
the boost to world trade is likely to be in the region of $500 billion on
an annual basis from the year 2000. <BR>
<BR>
Increasing trade is one sign of an international political economy in a
state of flux. The collapse of the iron curtain has added some 3.5 billion
people to what I would broadly define as a free market economy system. Technology
is accelerating the process. Money moves at the flick of a switch across
continents, not merely countries. Companies are no longer defined by where
they have their head offices: today half of all equity raised by European
companies is raised outside their countries of origin. Just as company managers
have to pursue strategies which reflect the reality of global markets, governments
cannot afford to conduct their economic policy in splendid isolation from
the rest of the world. For example, the effects of the markets place constraints
on fiscal and monetary policy today which make a nonsense of arguments about
maintaining national sovereignty in absolute terms. <BR>
<BR>
So much change packed into so short a time is, of course, unnerving, especially
for political elites which everywhere find their traditional powers eroded.
But the reaction to all this change should not be to hark back nostalgically
to comforting but outdated models of the nation state - or to protectionism,
the economic concomitant of nationalism. The way forward is to recognize
the realities of increasing interdependence in political and economic affairs,
and to develop the institutional framework accordingly. <BR>
<BR>
For Europe, this means greater political and economic integration. In the
political sphere, we need to ensure that the powers of the supranational
institutions of the EU work effectively, rather than seek to undermine them.
We need to have more majority voting within the Council on a wider range
of issues - particularly in view of the fact that there are 12 countries
queuing to join the EU. <BR>
<BR>
On the economic front, we must pursue a single currency within the time-frame
envisaged by the Maastricht Treaty. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, there are risks associated with this project, but I believe it
is essential to take an imaginative and positive leap forward. <HR>
<H1><A NAME="against"></A>... and against </H1>
<H3>David Marsh, director of European strategy at Robert Fleming, argues
that postponing Emu until members are ready will avoid chaos in the markets
<BR>
</H3>
The monetary Cassandras have got it wrong. An important part of the case
for enacting economic and monetary union in 1999 rests on the argument that
a postponement beyond the date planned in the Maastricht treaty would lead
to chaos. However, a delay to the Emu timetable, provided it were still
accompanied by credible policies to restore economic growth and rein back
budget deficits, would have a salutary effect. It would provide Europe with
a greater chance of genuine economic convergence and relative exchange rate
stability than if the present timetable were maintained. And it would raise
the credibility of Emu by making the Maastricht targets more feasible for
the weaker EU states which could join a modified form of monetary union
in the early years of the next century. <BR>
<BR>
Those in favour of sticking to the timetable, of course, argue along different
lines. Pro-Emu politicians and bankers state that postponement would plunge
Europe into political instability. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has even hinted
that an end to the Maastricht process could cause war. On the economic front,
there are fears that postponement could set off currency turbulence and
recession, and reverse the drive towards a single market. However sincerely
some people may hold these beliefs, constant repetition of such over-dramatized
anxieties represents little more than propaganda. <BR>
<BR>
Admittedly, the political momentum towards Emu in 1999 has lately picked
up as the result of Germany's desire for stable exchange rates to combat
unemployment. At the same time, worries about German jobs have led to a
watering down of previous German insistence for significant progress towards
political union as a condition for monetary union. As a way of railroading
through Emu on time, Germany also seems to be moving towards interpreting
the fiscal convergence criteria (targets for budget deficits and government
debts) far more generously than seemed likely at the end of last year. Yet
launching the euro in 1999 on the basis of significantly softened convergence
criteria risks confronting Europe with the worst of all worlds. <BR>
<BR>
If the criteria are bent, through the exercise of Franco-German political
will, the new European currency will lose credibility in the eyes of financial
markets. This would confront the European Central Bank with the unenviable
prospect of either a weak euro or higher interest rates - or possibly
both - during the ECB's first year of existence. A hastily-conceived
euro would not even guarantee German companies the exchange rate stability
they so desire. A significant number of larger EU countries - almost
certainly including the UK as well as Italy and Spain - would stay
outside Emu during its initial phase, so that European currencies, in reality,
would be only a little more stable than they are at present in the core
group of the admittedly imperfect exchange rate mechanism. <BR>
<BR>
The arguments against postponing Emu, on careful analysis, are less water-tight
than they often appear. It is sometimes alleged that delay could cause the
complete collapse of Maastricht. There is clearly a risk that this could
happen, especially if postponement caused the entire treaty to be renegotiated.
However, an orderly retreat - say, sometime next year - would
have more credibility than one conducted under the pressure of financial
market panic. Another assertion is that Emu delay could cause governments
to pursue fiscally irresponsible policies. In fact, to avoid the opprobrium
of financial markets, governments will continue to show self-interest in
pursuing budget deficit reductions. They will have a better chance if, through
relaxing the time constraints on reaching the Maastricht fiscal targets,
EU growth can be improved after a fall in average annual GDP expansion from
3.3% during the period 1986 to 1990 to 1.5% during the period 1991 to 1995.
<BR>
<BR>
Another view often heard is that an Emu postponement would send more speculative
funds into the Deutschmark adding to downward pressure on domestic German
investment and jobs. In fact, even after the recent correction to last year's
over-valuation of the Deutschmark, the economic justification for a further
run into the currency looks very slender. Emu delay would pave the way for
a more sensible valuation of the Deutschmark by allowing markets to assess,
in a more orderly way, the prospects for the French franc and other seemingly
vulnerable currencies. <BR>
<BR>
By stretching the timetable for monetary union, governments would increase
the prospects of securing both jobs and stable money in the new millennium.
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="singlemarket"></A>The key to a single market </H1>
<H3><BR>
If the financial markets have accepted monetary union, they have yet to
realize the implications. By Graham Bishop, adviser on European financial
affairs at Salomon Brothers <BR>
</H3>
The capital markets appear to have decided that Emu will start on schedule
and will endure - judging by current prices in large and active bond
markets. The spread between three-month French and German interest rates
in January 1999 should be a good indicator of market expectations of the
Emu start date, because the spread should be minimal when Emu commences.
Derived from today's yield curve, that forward spread fell to zero in March
1996. <BR>
<BR>
Moreover, the 10-year bond yield spread for these two countries has now
disappeared - implying that the market does not expect any particular
shift in the exchange rate between the French franc and Deutschmark during
the next decade. <BR>
<BR>
Even so, the convergence of the French and German yield curves does not,
by itself, prove that investors believe Emu is certain. But many investors
expect Emu to start on schedule because politicians are taking actions which
back up their strong statements of commitment. However, and remarkably,
few investors believe that 1997 budget deficits, for example in France,
will hit the Maastricht Treaty reference value of 3%. Instead, recognizing
the economic slowdown, investors have demonstrated that they believe that
a robust Emu can start with deficits above 3%. After all, the EU's aggregate
budget deficit peaked in 1993 at 6.2% of GNP and has only fallen to about
4.5% this year. Yet inflation has declined steadily from 4.1% in 1993 to
about 2.5% this year, despite these deficits. <BR>
<BR>
It is a natural and legitimate function of these markets to avoid risk and
investors' power to discipline errant governments has been demonstrated
several times in recent years. The build-up of financial assets, and thus
the size of markets, was driven in part by the need for citizens to save
for retirement. An ageing population, combined with the pressure on public
pension systems, makes it certain that the scale of retirement savings will
increase enormously in the years ahead. Such savers - whether individually
or via financial institutions - are keen to preserve the value of their
financial assets and are likely to use the new economic freedoms of the
Single European Market to move their capital anywhere within - or outside
- the European Union. <BR>
<BR>
Mature funded pension systems, together with individual long-term savings,
can exceed 100% of GNP. So the EU - with a current GNP close to Ecu7
trillion - can eventually look forward to a colossal pool of liquid
financial assets. <BR>
<BR>
Emu preparations are now urgent: in just 30 months' time participants must
have completed the construction of the euro capital market. The scale of
this new market may surprise some investors. As at April 1996, tradeable
US treasury bonds stood at Ecu1.6 trillion - an EU-wide Emu would have
about Ecu2.1 trillion of bonds outstanding. However, it is not clear yet
whether EU governments will convert the stock of public debt - as the
French government has said it will - or merely issue new debt in euros.
<BR>
<BR>
Government debt managers have a clear incentive to be at the leading edge
of market developments so that there are no artificial barriers to establishing
the lowest credit spreads versus other EU governments. Once such perceptions
are formed they are hard to shift. <BR>
<BR>
The establishment of the lowest possible European benchmark yields to serve
as the reference rate for credit spreads is crucial. The rapid creation
of a highly-liquid capital market should appeal to global investors and
help debt managers achieve their key objective of reducing their funding
costs. <BR>
<BR>
This process will give a further twist to the veto power of the markets
over an unsound Emu. Once Ecu2 trillion of highly-liquid government bonds
are distributed among global investors, potential capital flows may be large
relative to the foreign exchange reserves of EU central banks if investors
become nervous about the direction of fiscal policy. Central bank reserves
stand at Ecu400 billion but, in Emu, more than Ecu100 billion will cease
to be <I>foreign </I>exchange. Once Emu has started, a particular Emu member
state that chooses to move away from fiscal rectitude could find the markets
automatically extract a substantial penalty in interest charges, if those
unsound policies are sustained and the no-bail-out rule proves credible.
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="east"></A>Bringing in the East </H1>
<H3>Expanding eastwards may bring political stability, but can Europe afford
it? William Gasser and Armin Guhl find that economic arguments for enlargement
are less clear cut than the politicians think <BR>
</H3>
At its 1993 Copenhagen summit the European Union (EU) committed itself,
in principal, to enlarging to the east. Although no clear timetable has
been set, integrating the former communist countries of central and eastern
Europe into the capitalist west has already raised important questions over
the structure of the EU. <BR>
<BR>
Negotiations for entry of the most advanced eastern and central European
countries are likely to begin after the conclusion of the intergovernmental
conference. Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and perhaps the Slovak
Republic, can expect to join early in the next decade, although transition
periods will be long and financial transfers will be much smaller than those
that accompanied the southern expansion of the European Communiy in the
1980s. <BR>
<BR>
Transfer payments for agricultural and regional support already account
for 80% of the EU's annual budget. Without cuts, enlargement to the east
will dramatically raise the cost of integration. If entitlements are reduced,
today's main recipients - the EU's southern members and Ireland -
would bear most of the financial loss. Moreover, transfer payments strongly
distort market forces. Pressure from consumers, international trade partners
and cash-strapped finance ministries will reinforce the drive to reform
these subsidies. Fiscal solidarity of the richer EU countries will be limited
by their own employment problems and budget constraints. <BR>
<BR>
Despite incomplete liberalization of central and eastern Europe's economies,
trade with the EU has expanded significantly. Between 1989 and 1994, total
trade grew by almost 26% per year. Nevertheless, trade with central Europe
remains a small fraction of the EU's overall trade (about 2.5% in 1994)
and is still less than its trade with the Middle East (see chart 1). <BR>
<BR>
The EU has already replaced Russia as the most important trading partner
for reforming eastern nations. The EU's share of the combined trade of the
largest prospective members - Poland, Hungary, and the Czech and Slovak
Republics - increased from 26% in 1988 to 60% by 1995. <BR>
<BR>
But gains from liberalizing trade and market integration are likely to be
unevenly distributed within the EU. Germany, Italy, France and Austria now
account for three-quarters of EU trade with the east; Germany alone accounts
for nearly half of the total (see chart 2). Machinery, transport and telecommunications
equipment are the most important EU exports to the east, while imports consist
mainly of raw materials, semi-finished goods and components for further
manufacturing. <BR>
<BR>
Economic relations between the EU and the east have developed beyond mere
trade. Direct investments by western firms in eastern industry are helping
to build an integrated production structure. By 1995, foreign-owned companies
already accounted for 70% of all Hungarian exports. <BR>
<BR>
But southern European countries do not share the complementary economic
structures enjoyed between the more developed northern member states and
reforming eastern countries. Industry in Greece, Spain and Portugal remains
strongest in traditional, labour-intensive sectors. Thus industries in southern
and eastern Europe tend to rival rather than complement each other. <BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, the east has lower labour costs and therefore an edge in attracting
investment capital. Industrial wage costs in Hungary, the highest in the
east in 1994, amounted to only 58% of those in Portugal, which has the lowest
overall wages in the EU (see chart 3). <BR>
<BR>
The crucial question that EU expansion poses for less developed southern
member states is whether they can restructure their industry towards more
capital- and technology-intensive products quickly enough to avoid serious
and long-lasting economic disruption from eastern competitors. Income redistribution
from richer to poorer EU countries could help compensate potential losers
but risks introducing costly distortions. <BR>
<BR>
Integration into western Europe's market will also pose problems for eastern
economies. Abolishing tariffs and quotas in the west will give eastern producers
access to a market of 370 million consumers but, in turn, will expose them
to stronger competition (from western companies) in their own back yard.
<BR>
<BR>
Western firms have abundant capital, technology and marketing know-how to
succeed in competitive markets, while many newly-privatized and newly-formed
eastern companies do not. But how well these companies can compete will
depend more on their own governments' policies to promote internal competition
in labour, capital and output markets than on the size of transfer payments
from Brussels. <BR>
<BR>
A key objective of the Maastricht Treaty was to bridge the gap between rich
and poor member states. But eastern enlargement will require serious reforms
to the redistribution mechanisms. The present scheme rests on two pillars:
the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the structural funds. Including
central and eastern European countries in both mechanisms would require
substantial income transfers, which taxpayers in existing member states
are not likely to accept. <BR>
<BR>
Most eastern economies are more agricultural than today's EU members: 25%
of Poland's labour force, for example, is still employed in agriculture.
To extend agricultural price supports under present CAP criteria would encourage
expanded farm output and strain the present system to breaking point. Conservative
cost estimates for a CAP extension to Hungary, the Slovak Republic, the
Czech Republic and Poland would, by the year 2000, add nearly 20% to the
agricultural support budget planned for that year. Not surprisingly, western
European farm lobbies are among the most outspoken critics of eastward expansion.
<BR>
<BR>
Even greater problems would arise from extending the present regional development
policy to the east. Under current practices, new member states would receive
large net structural and regional assistance funds. <BR>
<BR>
The regional development system allows a region to claim subsidies if its
GDP per capita is less than 75% of the EU average. In 1994, eastern European
countries' average GDP per capita was less than 25% of the EU's average
(see chart 4). It is unlikely that these gaps will be closed quickly. Even
based on the optimistic forecast that eastern nations will grow three percentage
points faster than the EU average, they would need between 25 and 50 years
to reach 75% of the average income for the rest of the Union (see chart
5). <BR>
<BR>
Under present rules and practices, the total annual costs of EU enlargement
to Poland, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Hungary alone could
reach more than $65 billion a year by the year 2000 - most of it from
structural funds. This implies a 60% increase in the EU budget, and suggests
that the enlargement must focus less on transferring income to the east
and more on improving market access for eastern goods and services. <BR>
<BR>
The EU is entering rough waters. Eastward expansion is just one of the daunting
challenges it faces. The intergovernmental conference is likely to result
in further internal reforms but will fall short of fully resolving the problems.
<BR>
<BR>
The cost of inaction or rigidity would be large, and the very diversity
and complexity of the political issues at stake make compromise possible.
Even in politics, trade is not a zero-sum game. <BR>
<BR>
Difficulties reforming agricultural and regional development policies are
likely to leave eastern applicants facing lengthy transitions before they
can participate fully in these schemes. Most importantly, more EU decisions
will be made by qualified majorities. <BR>
<BR>
This will produce an EU with a variable geometry that allows groups of member
states to proceed at different speeds. One club - the Schengen group
- will have their borders fully open to each other, while a core Emu
group will be the first to introduce the single currency. Other groups will
pursue closer defence cooperation or participate in particular police actions
outside the community. <BR>
<BR>
Economic and political integration will continue well beyond the year 2000,
even if the all-or-nothing pattern of integration since the 1950s is abandoned.

<H1><A NAME="centralbank"></A>Creating a central bank for Europe </H1>
<H3><BR>
Europe's central bank will be responsible for the new currency. But arguments
persist over its role in monetary policy and the implications for national
central banks. <BR>
By Tessa Read </H3>
If European monetary union (Emu) goes ahead as planned on January 1 1999,
the countries in the euro currency area will irrevocably lock their exchange
rates and the euro will become the sole medium for settling wholesale transactions.
<BR>
<BR>
The European Central Bank (ECB) will formulate a unified monetary policy
which independent national central banks will implement. The role played
by these central banks will change dramatically. Those that are, to varying
extents, under the thumb of national governments will gain a formal independence
they did not formerly enjoy. Those that are now independent will effectively
lose authority to a Europe-wide collective decision-making process. Europe's
retail and investment banks will face severe costs and challenges in adapting
to Emu. These changes will affect all countries in Europe, whether they
enter into currency union or not. <BR>
<BR>
The ECB will be fully independent in its decision-making, which means it
will not be answerable to any EU institution, legislative body or national
government. Indeed, unlike many other independent central banks, it will
not be obliged to follow targets set by democratically-elected bodies and
its key personnel will be dismissable only on grounds of extreme personal
incapacity or misdemeanour. <BR>
<BR>
The ECB's decision-making body, the governing council, will be made up of
the heads of the national central banks and an executive board. The executive
board will consist of a president, vice-president and four directors, appointed
for (non-renewable) eight-year terms by agreement of the national governments
in the same way EU commissioners are appointed. The heads of the national
central banks will be appointed for five-year terms. <BR>
<BR>
It is too early to predict who will be proposed for these crucial posts,
but as Emu draws nearer, this will be a matter of great debate. Representation
of national central bank governors will enable countries' individual views
to be expressed. Indeed, because decisions in the governing council will
be taken on a simple majority basis, without weighted voting, the larger
European countries have argued that smaller countries will be afforded disproportionate
power. <BR>
<BR>
In fact it is far more likely that the executive board will usually have
the whip hand since it is the most natural substantial power bloc on the
governing council. This will be particularly the case if only a few countries
qualify for Emu. The ECB executive board members will be the six most powerful
economic policy decision-makers in Europe, with power to affect the economies
of countries both inside and outside Emu. <BR>
<BR>
The decision-making structure of the ECB is effectively identical to that
of the Bundesbank, where executive power is held by central appointees and
regional central bank governors play a lesser role. This approach has clearly
worked for Germany's relatively homogeneous economy, but there is no guarantee
that it would be as successful for a Europe-wide monetary union covering
a far more diverse economic environment. <BR>
<BR>
One of the major issues at stake here is the tension between the promise
of stable low inflation if executive board members have tight control, and
the possibility of severe structural unemployment in depressed countries
and regions of the monetary union if national central bank governors' powers
are reduced to such an extent that they are not able to institute effective
countermeasures. <BR>
<BR>
The prime objective of the system of central banks (the ECB plus the national
central banks) will be the maintenance of low inflation. This goal is not
in dispute, but intermediate targets and the instruments used to achieve
low inflation are a different matter because different policy tools are
used in different EU member states. <BR>
<BR>
One bone of contention is over whether or not targeting money supply should
be the prime control method, as it has been in Germany. The disagreement
among leading European nations over this issue has not yet been resolved,
and so the ECB's statutes currently allow for money supply and more direct
approaches to inflation control. The European Monetary Institute (EMI),
set up to create the ECB and headed by Alexandre Lamfalussy, announced last
month that further analysis of different monetary policy strategies was
required and that it intends to carry this out this year. <BR>
<BR>
The specific monetary policy instruments to be used to achieve low inflation
are also still under discussion. Minimum reserve requirements are an aspect
of this that could profoundly affect the competitiveness of Europe's commercial
banks. European heads of state have given their consent to a central bank
that may conduct open market operations, may stipulate that banks hold minimum
reserves with itself or with national central banks, and may use other instruments
of monetary control. <BR>
<BR>
Minimum reserve requirements have long been used by European countries where
markets for treasury bills and other debt instruments are less deep and
liquid than in sophisticated centres, to assist central banks in managing
short-term interest rates. Since reserves held at the central bank usually
pay no interest or interest below market rates, there is an incentive for
banks to raise their lending rates if their business expands faster than
the central bank wishes and this puts a brake on monetary growth. Minimum
reserve requirements are in force in nine EU states, including France, Germany,
Italy and Spain, so there has been strong support for their use by the ECB.
<BR>
<BR>
The UK does not use minimum reserve requirements to control liquidity in
the banking sector since they amount to a differential tax burden on banks,
which distorts the market. And this fact has been recognized elsewhere in
Europe, as witnessed by the progressive lowering of rates in other EU countries.
If reserve requirements are not harmonized across Emu countries, banks in
countries with the lowest rates will be at a competitive advantage. Indeed
a recent report by the British Bankers Association noted that if the UK
were not in Emu &quot;this could be to the City's advantage and the knowledge
of this should act as a moderating influence on thinking within the EMI&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
The Maastricht Treaty decrees that open market operations - the method
by which the central bank sets the interest rate through the banking sector
- will be conducted through repurchase tenders only. This is the method
currently used by the Bundesbank, but is not the exclusive method used by
other central banks such as the Bank of England. <BR>
<BR>
While the Maastricht Treaty rests control over monetary policy with the
ECB (and independent national central banks), there are no provisions in
the ECB statutes for control over fiscal policy, implying that it will continue
to rest with governments. The Delors Report recommended binding rules for
the conduct of fiscal policy and penalties on nations which break them.
This has been followed by the proposal of the Waigel stability pact which
argues for the imposition of automatic penalties on countries whose budget
deficits exceed 3% of GDP. <BR>
<BR>
Economists often argue in favour of an element of fiscal harmonization under
Emu in order to avoid the danger that some countries will seek to free-ride
with expansionary Keynesian policies on the back of a steady exchange rate
and interest rates which reflect others' caution. But the Maastricht Treaty
specifically states that Emu countries should stick to fiscal restraints,
but that it is acceptable for targets to be missed in exceptional and temporary
cases. In any event, strict restrictions on national autonomy could cause
a backlash against the European project in depressed countries and regions.
<BR>
<BR>
Central to this debate is Germany's desire to ensure that its economy is
not dragged down by less inflation-averse partners, as against the desire
of less robust economies to retain the means to deal with shocks to their
economies. <BR>
<BR>
Although the Maastricht Treaty does not specify that Europe's central banks
should have control over fiscal policy, it is possible that in practice
the independent and empowered central banks will play more of a role in
this. This would mean a delegation of the power to tax from elected to non-elected
bodies. <BR>
<BR>
This shift would be significant both practically and conceptually. Independent
central banks currently withhold interest rate cuts until they are satisfied
that prudent fiscal policies are in place. An extension of these sorts of
powers will vary from country to country. If, for example, the UK were in
Emu, the UK government would probably resist transferring any control over
fiscal policy to the Bank of England - but it might be pressured to
do so if the credibility of its economic policy was under question. <BR>
<BR>
Arrangements for prudential supervision and the lender-of-last-resort role
are important for all banks. No specific objective of sustaining the health
and effective functioning of the banking and financial systems is stated
in the statute of the European system of central banks. Nor is the ECB pinpointed
as a lender of last resort, although it is not specifically ruled out either.
It is likely, though, that this role can be maintained by national central
banks, but with the European central bank having the power to overrule if
a two-thirds majority of the governing council votes that a national central
bank's actions are interfering with the objectives and tasks of the European
system of central banks. <BR>
<BR>
How this is likely to work in practice is not at all clear and its importance
to Europe's banking community means that it is an issue that needs to be
resolved. The delegation of this role to national central banks is supported
by an odd alliance. The Bundesbank believes a lender-of-last-resort function
for the ECB could entail moral hazard and might encourage inflation. Heads
of EU governments who are Euro-sceptics are equally opposed to it, but because
they wish to maximize subsidiarity. <BR>
<BR>
The Maastricht Treaty has left open the possibility that the ECB will be
involved in supervision of banks and other credit institutions. But as it
has not set down any rules by which it would operate this supervision, it
is likely that national central banks will continue to undertake this function,
on an increasingly passported basis, following the Second Banking Coordination
Directive and the Investment Services Directive. Once a bank or other credit
institution is licensed to operate and carry out a range of functions in
one EU country, it has the right to set up an operation in any other EU
country. Again, supporters of delegation include the more Euro-sceptic nations
on grounds of subsidiarity - this time in alliance with banks labouring
under relatively costly regulatory regimes which seek a level playing field.
In any event, this delegation of responsibility to national central banks
might change if the ECB were to take on the function of the lender of last
resort. <BR>
<BR>
Europe's central banks also have to prepare for managing exchange rate policy
in a multi-speed Europe. On the assumption that not all EU countries will
advance to monetary union at the same time, the central banks and governments
of states yet to accede to Emu will have to decide on an exchange rate policy
- whether or not to peg to the euro. <BR>
<BR>
Some countries, principally Germany, argue that the <I>outs</I> would have
to peg to the euro. The more sceptical countries, which are likely to be
out, among them the UK, argue in favour of flexibility for national economies.
The governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, has publicly argued for
this on many occasions, in direct opposition to the views of Bundesbank
president Hans Tietmeyer. <BR>
<BR>
It is probable that resolution of the debate for each country will be influenced
by whether it wanted to join but did not meet the convergence criteria (wannabes)
or met the criteria but did not want to join (don't wannabes). The result
could be a tripartite Europe with some countries engaged in full monetary
union - most likely Germany, France, Benelux, and possibly Ireland
and Portugal; the wannabes attempting to peg to the euro in an ERM2 -
most likely the southern European countries plus Sweden; and the don't wannabes
leaving themselves free to float - most likely the UK and Denmark.
Although the fear, on the part of the <I>ins,</I> of competitive devaluations
by the <I>outs</I> might lead them to blackmail the <I>outs </I>to enter
an ERM2 on pain of being excluded from the single market. The new east European
EU members will be an unknown quantity. <BR>

<H2><A NAME="pageant"></A>Investors' pageant </H2>
When it comes to attracting overseas investors, most of Europe's diverse
business communities seem to rely on the same main selling point. Almost
every region between Birmingham and Bologna claims to be located at the
heart of Europe. <BR>
<BR>
Yet the regional development industry admits that it is not location, nor
even cost, that sways companies from the Americas and from Asia to set up
shop in a particular part of Europe. If price were all that mattered, labour-intensive
producers like Goodyear would scarcely have considered manufacturing in
Luxembourg, one of the most expensive business locations in Europe in terms
of labour costs and taxation. <BR>
<BR>
The US-based tyre manufacturer has recently extended the production of truck
tyres at its Luxembourg factory, thanks to a legal change that allowed Sunday
working for the first time. Likewise, TDK of Japan has decided to begin
manufacturing CDRs - a new type of compact disc - at its Luxembourg
plant. <BR>
<BR>
Like most European investment locations, Luxembourg will never be able to
compete with Asia or most of the Americas in terms of costs, deregulation
or flexibility. Romain Foarges, a commercial attache at the Luxembourg Board
of Economic Development, says that it lobbies overseas companies only when
they have already decided to invest in Europe. So Luxembourg is competing
with France, Germany and Belgium, but not with Taiwan, Hong Kong or Mexico.
<BR>
<BR>
Inward investment for many European governments is a priority. The figures
suggest, however, that the battle may already have been lost, as more domestic
companies decide to invest overseas where costs are lower and business regulations
more flexible. <BR>
<BR>
Recent figures from the German ministry of economics show that in 1995 German
companies invested Dm48 billion abroad, while less than Dm14 billion was
pumped into the German economy by foreign companies. The deficit would have
been even greater if investment in Germany's medium-cost neighbours -
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and others - had been as substantial
as economists predicted in 1989. <BR>
<BR>
Attracting foreign investors is so difficult that most development corporations
rely on repeat investments. Jean-Daniel Tordjman, France's ambassador for
international investment, says that the Japanese automotive manufacturers'
huge investments in Britain are an accepted fact which cannot now be reversed.
Nevertheless France still has the chance to establish itself as a manufacturing
location for automotive components and has seen several large investments
recently by General Motors, Ford and Mitsubishi. <BR>
<BR>
Most countries use tax breaks to market themselves - but that may be
an illusion. According to Jeannot Erpelding, a strategist at TDK in Luxembourg,
local tax breaks and investment incentives have made scarcely any difference
to the company's latest venture. <BR>
<BR>
In fact, Luxembourg was chosen because it was predictable. &quot;It's an
enormous advantage that the lines of communication are very short in Luxembourg.
If there's a problem we can solve it quickly,&quot; Erpelding explains.
&quot;We just go straight to the minister.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
That suggests inward investment is even more difficult for large countries.
The UK, which attracts one-third of all world investment in European Union
countries, is beginning to stress its competitiveness in terms of labour
costs. The largest foreign investment in Britain this year, in terms of
jobs, involves labour-intensive manufacture of electronics components. The
venture by Chunghwa Picture Tubes of Taiwan has created over 3,000 jobs
in Scotland. <BR>
<BR>
Yet future overseas investors who make their choice on the basis of cost
will be dealing with slimmer differences as wage costs converge. In theory,
that means that nations with highly-skilled workforces (such as Germany
or Ireland) have most to gain, but economies which are still developing
(such as Poland and Hungary) run the risk of deterring foreign investors
if wage costs rise too quickly. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Of course, the emerging economies of eastern Europe are bound to attract
investment in years to come. However, people should be very cautious of
ascribing a competitive advantage to low labour costs. Other issues, particularly
skills and infrastructure, are also critically important,&quot; says Andrew
Fraser, chief executive of the Invest in Britain Bureau. <BR>
<BR>
Fraser does not believe that investors have been deterred by the uncertainty
over Britain and Europe, and whether the UK will adopt the single currency:
&quot;In many ways the UK has led the EU in the development of the single
market agenda on behalf of business interests. For example, in terms of
deregulation and privatization, the rest of Europe is having to catch up
with the considerable lead the UK has established in areas such as telecomms,
utilities, steel and airlines.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But it is only in the financial services industry that Britain's lead is
undisputed. Banks, brokers and investors have settled in London or Edinburgh
regardless of location, costs, an uncertain future in the EU or any other
factors. They have relocated to join the rest of their market and that is
probably the strongest card which Europe has to play in attracting investment
beyond the year 2000, whether in high-tech manufacturing, services or finance.

<H3>THE MOORGATE SAGA </H3>
<H2>Banking on a Swiss roll </H2>
<h4>Grand Hotel Baur au Lac, Zurich, Switzerland</h4>
Only Holey Buckett can roll into my office with the notion that a Swiss
bank is in play, and even Holey only after lunch, and as to the notion that
he and I can pick it up and play with it, well, it just goes to show how
salesmanlike Holey can be, but how I wish he saves this for the customers.
<H1></H1>
He plunks these certificates down on my desk, with a design on them featuring
cuckoos and gnomes and gothic lettering which makes me figure it is German,
then he waits for me to look impressed, this (he says) is the stock of the
Union Bank of Switzerland, my friend Martin collects it, and if we help
him fill his hand he remembers who his friends are. <BR>
<BR>
Sure, he is welcome to bet on his chances but if he hopes to scoop up UBS
he must have a better chance of scooping up the Matterhorn, I figure if
anyone attempts this Switzerland declares war, with the top UBS guys in
command of the army, for them the bank is just a day job. <BR>
<BR>
Never mind, Holey says, this is just a civil war or maybe an inter-cantonal
conflict, Martin is Swiss and runs an investment fund there, he skirmishes
with UBS for years, all about special votes for Swiss citizens and the status
of the bearer stock, but now he figures he can see the winning-post, old
Senn is standing down as chairman and Robert Studer prepares to step up,
but Martin can think of a far better chairman, meaning him. <BR>
<BR>
Then Holey begins to tell me how compared with Citi or Barclays or whatever
UBS underperforms, I figure the fact is it underreports, like they teach
us in banking college, to analyze a Swiss corporation do not waste time
on the published accounts, these are apt to be kinda conservative, just
look at the price and assume the market gets it right. <BR>
<BR>
Even so, there must be gold in them thar hills, and also in the vaults,
not to mention some strategic holdings that are in UBS's books at their
historic costs, from 1931, like maybe a few reinsurance companies and private
banks, and if we can get our hands on some of these and make a turn, it
helps us pay the rent in Moorgate. <BR>
<BR>
Besides, I figure if there is one place where our bank needs a beachhead
it is Switzerland, the only triple-A country in Europe and maybe the world
and the big winner from the European single currency, on account the Swiss
guarantee not to join it, already the funk money comes pouring in from Germany,
the Swiss banks must think it is just like the old days. <BR>
<BR>
I tell Holey we must not let the guys at UBS think our bank is trying to
undermine them, or not until it happens, otherwise they cross us off their
Christmas card list and other lists we need to be on, if we hold all this
stock surely we have to declare it, I seem to recall there are rules about
this. <BR>
<BR>
So there are, Holey says, so here is what we do to keep them, Hillboot Intergalactic
quietly extends its market making operations to include UBS, then we can
take the stock onto our back book and no-one has to know about it, or not
until it suits us to come out and swing a deal, this is known as the Swiss
Bank gambit, it takes one to know one, says Holey. <BR>
<BR>
Well, we rig up an extension to the warehouse and take some of Martin's
stock on board, under plain cover, and I book myself into the Baur au Lac
for a late skiing holiday which just happens to coincide with UBS's meeting,
but what do I find when I get there but a message to call Rainer Gut at
Credit Suisse, Herbie, he says, they tell me you take an interest in UBS,
maybe you and I need to talk turkey. <BR>
<BR>
Mom, I know Rainer from the days before CSFB when his bank is still married
to White Weld, and his market intelligence is always good, but all the same
this shakes me, I face an instant choice between straight denial and playing
it his way and decide to play it his way. <BR>
<BR>
We fix up to meet on the steamer that does rundfahrts round the lake, where
Rainer opens some of his hand to me: in strict confidence, he says, UBS
is getting flustered, they figure Martin may have enough stock to take over,
so old Senn comes pattering along to me in secret, saying howsabout a nice
friendly merger, which sets up a giant Swiss bank to tower over the Swiss
Bank and dominate the world? <BR>
<BR>
Naturally I stall him, Rainer says, on account if word gets out how UBS
prepares to trade its independence, then it is put into play, and stays
there, no way ever gets found to push that toothpaste back into the tube,
as Warburg learns to its cost, so do not tell anyone, Rainer insists, and
at this point his eyelid develops a twitch. <BR>
<BR>
So I am sure he is as shocked as I am when this story is spread in full
detail all over the blatts, UBS's stock price jumps and leaves the UBS guys
struggling to engage reverse gear, this is all premature, they say, UBS
is as sound as a cowbell and does not need to merge with anybody, or if
it does, it can join up with the Swiss Bank and tower over Credit Suisse,
and on this the price jumps again, and our rent is covered for another week.
<BR>
<BR>
After this all is set for the grand climax at UBS's meeting, the contested
election for chairman, with the board backing Robert while Martin proposes
himself, in a crammed hall he makes his pitch, he wraps himself up in the
national flag and proclaims it is in the highest traditions of Swiss banking
for this bank to make even more money, and its stockholders to be even richer,
and he is the guy they need, vote early, vote often. <BR>
<BR>
Mom, I do say he sounds confident, right up to the moment the poll is delivered,
tho' not afterwards, Robert romps home, he benefits from a late swing in
the vote and guess who swings it his way, Hillboot Intergalactic Nominees.
<BR>
<BR>
Martin is kinda vexed with us, but we figure we are better off for now with
Robert remembering he owes us one, we just hold the stock on the back book
and wait for the bid to come along, much love from <BR>
<BR>
Your playful son <BR>

<H3>EDITORIAL</H3>
<h2>Just awards </H2>
They don't quite have the sparkle of Hollywood's Oscars. No glamorous actresses
turn up in <I>risqu&eacute; </I>dresses. There are no crass speeches. But,
in their five years of existence, <I>Euromoney</I>'s Awards for Excellence
have become, in a way, the Oscars of the financial world. <BR>
<BR>
A word of explanation is due on why we believe the awards are important.
<BR>
<BR>
For users of the financial markets - particularly more infrequent users
- each transaction is of vital importance. This is true whether the
deal is an acquisition, an IPO, a first bond issue for an emerging country,
an infrastructure project, even a plain-vanilla capital raising. Get it
wrong, and your company's (or country's) future can be jeopardized. <BR>
<BR>
But, for users, the financial markets often appear hard to understand and
tricky. Bankers do not make the process easier by talking in a marketing
speak that often obfuscates the truth. Users find it hard to differentiate
between hype and real capability. Choosing a lead manager (or adviser, or
arranger) for the first time can be a baffling experience. <BR>
<BR>
It was this thought process that led us to institute the Awards for Excellence
in 1992. The intention was to identify systematically which banks showed
genuine excellence in which areas of the business. We believed our own experience
- and an exhaustive research process - would enable us to discriminate
between the excellent, the mediocre and the bogus in a way many users would
be unable to. <BR>
<BR>
We can't say we've always got the right answers. But, by always being conservative
in our picks (and avoiding the temptation to choose a racier, but less reliable,
firm for the sake of a more newsworthy story), we believe we have been wrong
very rarely. <BR>
<BR>
What has changed over five years? The vicissitudes of the markets have tended
to throw up one clear winner among the investment banks each year. In 1993
it was Goldman Sachs; in 1995 Merrill Lynch. This year, Morgan Stanley has
taken a disproportionate number of awards. Among the commercial banks, Citibank
has always won a lot of awards, partly because it has a strong presence
so many countries. <BR>
<BR>
The increasing consolidation of the industry is also plain. Our short-lists
for each category have got shorter each year. In many businesses now, just
two banks comprise the top tier. In mergers and acquisitions, for instance,
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs stand way above their rivals. In only a
few areas - usually those undergoing major change - is this not
true. Examples are project finance, Euro-MTNs and derivatives. <BR>
<BR>
The growing importance of emerging markets has forced us to expand the number
of countries in which we give awards. Countries such as Peru, Romania or
Vietnam are becoming part of the global marketplace. If anything, we should
probably look at more such countries. We don't yet make awards in countries
such as Ukraine, Bangladesh or Uruguay. We ignore central Asia. We plan
to remedy that next year. <HR>
<H2>The temptation of the regulators </H2>
Every time a scandal hits the international financial markets, politicians
and the press scream for tighter regulation. <BR>
<BR>
This happened most vociferously with the spate of derivatives losses in
1994, culminating in the case brought by Procter and Gamble against Bankers
Trust. For a time, it looked as though, in the US at least, laws would be
introduced to clamp down on the use of derivatives. <BR>
<BR>
That threat passed. Indeed, the derivatives market has proved that it works
very efficiently, given all the risks inherent in it. Large losses by end-users
have been surprisingly rare. <BR>
<BR>
The regulators' eye has now turned to the commodities market, in the light
of the losses incurred by Sumitomo Corporation in copper. A consensus has
already formed that the London Metal Exchange lacks transparency, is riddled
with dodgy practices and, therefore, needs to be regulated. <BR>
<BR>
But the regulators, before they act too hastily, need to remember what is
the purpose of regulation. It is, most obviously, to protect inexperienced
investors, particularly individuals. But second, more controversially, it
is to <I>encourage </I>the growth and efficiency of markets by stamping
out inappropriate practices. An exchange which users are wary of because
its methods are inefficient or untrustworthy, will wither away. <BR>
<BR>
But that cannot be said of the LME. Its copper trading has grown to overtake
its US rivals in the past decade. Some of its conventions - such as
allowing roll-overs at historical prices - probably are a deterrent
to users. But regulators should resist the temptation to impose the sorts
of rules, such as position limits, that constrain the growth of US exchanges.
They do not help the process of price formation or protect investors. They
merely the regulators' desire to reduce volatility.<BR>

<H3>A SUPPLEMENT TO EUROMONEY/JUNE 1996</H3> 
<H2>Spain keeps Europe in its grasp <BR>
</H2>

</A><A HREF="#sell-off">Spain's great sell-off </A></H4>

<H2><A NAME="gov-tasks"></A>The tasks of government </H2>
<H4>By conceding power to regional parties, Spain's government may find
it more difficult to make it into European monetary union. Jules Stewart
reports </H4>
On the day Spain's centre-right government took office, it found out the
hard way the high cost of shooting from the hip. Even before he was sworn
in, foreign minister Abel Matutes said in an interview that if Spain failed
to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria on time, the clock should be
stopped to allow it a chance to catch up. <BR>
<BR>
The market scratched its head and pondered the implications of this Eurogaffe.
But it reacted swiftly and mercilessly the following day, when finance minister
Rodrigo Rato, pressed for a comment on his colleague's remarks, said he
believed the foreign minister's statement to be &quot;realistic&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
In two hours the benchmark 10-year Bono was down half a point and the Deutschmark
exchange rate fell from 83.4 to 83.85. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;They [the new government] have spent the last 13 years in opposition
saying whatever was politically expedient and knowing that it would have
no impact abroad,&quot; says a Spanish banker. &quot;Now they've learned
that it's a different ball game. It was a painful lesson.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Prime minister Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Aznar, a former tax collector, is
determined to convince the world at large that Spain will not slacken until
it becomes a fully-fledged partner in an integrated Europe. But the Popular
Party's victory in the general election last March was narrower than forecast
and the markets gave a sceptical reaction when Aznar negotiated an alliance
with Catalan and other regional nationalist parties to ensure a clear parliamentary
majority. The new government was forced to concede fiscal and economic powers
to regional supporters in exchange for votes - an arrangement similar
to the one former socialist prime minister Felipe Gonz&aacute;lez struck
with the Catalans to hold onto power until last month. Commenting on this
uncomfortable relationship, strategist Kit Juckes at NatWest Markets in
London says that economic austerity measures and regional autonomy make
for &quot;uneasy bedfellows&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
But Aznar is committed to Europe and to domestic reform. He has stated that
all government policies, whether economic or political, will be aimed at
reducing the budget deficit. <BR>
<BR>
Two days after taking office the government announced Pta200 billion ($1.6
billion)<B> </B>in spending cuts for the current year and expressed confidence
that Spain could reduce its budget deficit from 5.7% to 4.5% of GDP in the
current fiscal year and meet the Maastricht target of 3% in 1997. <BR>
<BR>
One of Aznar's most enthusiastically-applauded appointments was that of
Jos&eacute; Barea, the man directly entrusted with the task of controlling
the state budget. The 73-year-old professor of economics has served Spanish
leaders from the late General Franco to socialist Gonz&aacute;lez. Barea
heads the newly-created Office of Budget Control and reports directly to
the prime minister. <BR>
<BR>
Barea has never been known to mince his words. His initial assessment calls
for Draconian measures that include the removal of tax breaks, closure of
public companies and a freeze on the civil service payroll and wages. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Pta200 billion in spending cuts is not enough,&quot; says Barea.
&quot;It has to go beyond that - and in this year. The social security
deficit alone was forecast at 0.3% of GDP this year but the final figure
will be 0.8%. Spending has to be reduced by at least another Pta400 billion.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Barea says that a certain degree of imagination is required to achieve this
goal. For example the knife has to be taken to subsidies to state-owned
companies which soak up about Pta1.2 trillion a year. Barea's programme
also calls for immediate privatization or even closure of loss-making public
companies. <BR>
<BR>
Voters who believed the Popular Party's election promises of tax cuts -
Spain's top rate is 56% - will be less enthusiastic about Barea's programme.
He has ruled out any chance of reducing taxes this year or next, although
he says there is scope for restructuring the system. <BR>
<BR>
Aznar's new team is at pains to give the impression that it has come in
swinging an axe through the corridors of overstaffed government ministries.
But not everybody is convinced there is enough fat to trim to make the stated
deficit targets. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The budget deficit is bigger than those of most other EU countries
but the public sector is also relatively smaller,&quot; says C&eacute;sar
Molinas, chief economist at Spanish stockbroker FG Inversiones, which was
recently acquired by Merrill Lynch. &quot;We cannot cut back on social services
to the degree that would be possible in Germany, for instance, and we have
about half the number of civil servants per inhabitant as Britain. So it
is no easy task to reduce public spending.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Molinas is even less optimistic about the government's chance of success
in reducing unemployment. The official jobless rate is 22%. &quot;I don't
see the solution,&quot; he says. &quot;Unemployment has become institutionalized
in Spain. We have the lowest level of worker participation in Europe. There
are thousands of jobs that nobody wants to do and labour is far from cheap.
It's a case of a missing link in our economic development which has led
to a marginalized generation of workers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But Spain's new government has entered office at a favourable time for the
economy: interest rates are clearly on a downward trend, inflation is forecast
to decline to 3.0% this year from 4.3% in 1995 and was well within the Bank
of Spain's target of 3.5% to 4.0% for the first quarter for this year. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The economic base is sound,&quot; says Jorge Calvet, managing director
of SBC Warburg in Madrid. &quot;Equities are cheap and banks and industrials
are fantastically healthy. The government's determination to shrink the
public sector is a cause for optimism.&quot; <bR><BR><BR>
<H2><A NAME="necessary"></A>&quot;Cut whatever is necessary&quot; </H2>
<H4>Crist&oacute;bal Montoro, Spain's secretary of state for the economy,
is the new government's key figure in matters of economic policy. His task
is to &quot;subordinate all political and economic policies to the reduction
of the deficit&quot; </H4>
<B>What are your most urgent economic priorities and how do you propose
to achieve them?</B> <BR>
<BR>
There are basically two challenges facing Spain. In the first instance we
must consolidate our recovery because Spaniards have been living with an
economic crisis for too long. The economy is growing but most Spaniards
do not perceive this growth. So we need to encourage growth and especially
employment. The other side of the same coin is to ensure Spain's successful
integration into European Monetary Union within the stipulated deadline.
<BR>
<BR>
In Spain's case, stimulating growth and meeting the criteria for Emu are
one and the same. Growth will be achieved by lowering interest rates, creating
a favourable environment for investment and laying the foundations for economic
stability in order to boost business confidence. We need to contain inflation
to remain competitive and we must not defend our position with exchange
rate manipulations. There is no future for us if we fail to bring about
a stable economic environment and stimulate domestic savings. As far as
Spain is concerned, we would have to achieve these goals even if Maastricht
did not exist. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Doubt has been cast on Spain's ability to meet the Maastricht convergence
criteria on time. What are your views?</B> <BR>
<BR>
It will not be easy and we have already lost a lot of time, but I am convinced
that it is possible to meet the criteria on inflation and the budget deficit.
The fundamentals provide hope and it is a task the government has taken
on board from the very first day. I am optimistic that we will achieve convergence.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Where do you see the budget deficit this year and next?</B> <BR>
<BR>
We will cut back on whatever spending is necessary to bring it below 4.5%
of GDP this year and our budget proposals for 1997 will set a target of
3% of GDP. <BR>
<BR>
<B>So tighter control on spending is the primary weapon for combating the
budget deficit?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Yes, but it is not the only one. We also intend to further deregulate our
economic structures and key sectors. We will open a dialogue with business
and the unions on a social pact aimed at introducing greater efficiency
into the labour market. This is crucial in a country where a high level
of unemployment and job instability are undermining confidence and holding
back consumer spending. We want to modernize the labour market and we believe
that wage settlements should be set in line with productivity. Above all
we want to eliminate any apprehensions about labour relations. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Do your plans for deregulation call for speeding up the privatization
programme?</B> <BR>
<BR>
This is very much on the government's agenda. Privatization is a way to
improve the efficiency of key sectors such as transport, telecommunications
and energy. But we do not look upon privatization as a one-off source of
financing. It is part of our efficiency drive which is reflected in this
ministry, where we have eliminated overlapping departments and cut back
on the number of high-ranking offices. We have simplified the public administration
structures and we will introduce extremely severe controls on public spending.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Can you give any specific examples?</B> <BR>
<BR>
We plan to submit a new budget law that will impose strict restrictions
on this or any future government by subordinating increased spending to
parliamentary approval. <BR>
<BR>
We also plan to rationalize the system of financing for Spain's 17 autonomous
regional governments by setting up a system of fiscal co-responsibility.
The basic underlying idea is to ensure that public spending is a reflection
of the country's need to modernize its economy. <bR><BR><BR>
<H2><A NAME="growth"></A>Banks search for growth </H2>
<H4>Spain's top five banks reported first quarter operating profit increases
of between 14.5% and 59%. But question marks hang over the future <BR>
of some of the major players </H4>
Speculation about Argentaria's future is greeted with sepulchral silence
by staff still recovering from the shock of seeing their chairman, Francisco
Luz&oacute;n, summarily sacked by the new government to make way for stockbroker
and political appointee Francisco Gonz&aacute;lez. &quot;He has close links
to power in the new government and he was after a high-profile job,&quot;
says a Spanish banker. <BR>
<BR>
Prime minister Aznar is under pressure to reward his major backers with
political favours and heads are expected to roll at public companies. The
problem is that for the outside world, at least, Argentaria is not thought
of as a public company. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Luz&oacute;n sold the first three tranches of Argentaria's privatization
on the strength of his personal professionalism,&quot; says a London analyst.
&quot;I find it bizarre that the government believes its 25% stake entitles
it to sack the chairman - US and British investors are not going to
like this.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Banco Popular, the smallest and historically most profitable of the big
five, is seen to have reached a strategic crossroads. The market believes
it needs to achieve significant short-term growth to keep up with its rivals
and that the most logical way forward is via acquisition. Looking about
for a likely target, the finger points to BCH. The banking sector's hottest
rumour is denied by Banco Popular's general secretary Manuel Martin. &quot;It
is out of the question - for now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Banco Popular is under severe pressure to deliver value to its shareholders.
While still well ahead of the pack in terms of net interest margin, operating
profitability and return on equity, people are beginning to wonder how long
it can continue to squeeze useful business out of its niche of small and
medium-sized corporate lending, and its middle-income retail client base.
<BR>
<BR>
Analyst Mariano Colmenar at BZW in Madrid says the rumours of a merger with
BCH are overdone. &quot;It wouldn't be logical,&quot; he says. &quot;There
have been talks with BCH but Banco Popular doesn't have experience in disposing
of non-performing assets. It would do better to go after one of the vulnerable
regional banks.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
As for BCH, the market seems confident that it has weathered the worst of
a traumatic merger between two ailing giants and is on a recovery track.
&quot;The Banco Central-Banco Hispano Americano merger five years ago cost
us Pta800 billion ($6.3 billion), of which up to Pta480 billion was for
non-performing loans,&quot; says BCH's director general Emilio Novela. &quot;The
two banks were also brought together on the eve of one of Spain's worst
recessions in memory.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The two sector leaders, Banco Santander and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV),
after years of chasing the same business with similar strategies, are beginning
to move in different directions. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;With [BBV's] base in Spain, we will export our expertise to higher
growth and less mature markets,&quot; says BBV's director general Luis Bastida.
&quot;The political, social and economic improvement those markets are showing
is not a temporary phenomenon. They are pursuing serious economic reforms
and we want to be part of that growth process.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Bastida says the emphasis will be on shareholder value rather than size.
&quot;There is no need to be the biggest,&quot; he says. &quot;Nowadays
there is little margin for error in Spanish banking and size is no guarantee
of success.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Banco Santander is not uncomfortable with its position as Spain's biggest
bank in terms of total income. &quot;We are a universal bank with 35% of
our assets located outside Spain,&quot; says deputy chairman Mat&iacute;as
Rodr&iacute;guez Inciarte. Banco Santander is also active in Latin America.
More than 20% of its income comes from shareholdings in First Union in the
US and Royal Bank of Scotland, with which it has focused on the European
market through its IBOS (Interbank Online System)<B> </B>cross-border electronic
payments system. At home, Banco Santander fighting to hold its market has
introduced an array of new products such as telephone banking. <bR><BR><BR>
<H2><A NAME="sell-off"></A>Spain's great sell-off </H2>
<H4>Spain's new industry minister Josep Piqu&eacute; is determined to speed
up the government's privatization programme </H4>
&quot;Privatization is probably the biggest challenge facing this ministry,&quot;
says Piqu&eacute;. &quot;My initial idea is to privatize all public companies
during the current term of office and I am considering setting up a privatization
office to implement this programme. As for (state industrial holding) T&eacute;neo,
in the medium term, it should cease to exist.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
T&eacute;neo includes a mix of assets - from the highly profitable
electrical utility Endesa, which has the largest market capitalization of
all companies listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange, to chronic loss-maker
Iberia. The entire holding has a book value of Pta750 billion ($5.9 billion).
Taken separately, the market value of the government's 66.8% stake in Endesa
is valued at Pta1.2 trillion. Piqu&eacute; favours an international public
offering for Endesa via share tranches small enough to avoid flooding the
market . <BR>
<BR>
Piqu&eacute;'s enthusiasm for privatization is shared by Jos&eacute; Barea
(responsible to prime minister Aznar on matters of budgetary policy as director
of the newly-created budget office). <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We have to privatize right now and not only those companies which
are in profit,&quot; says Barea. He says that most loss-makers have suffered
from poor management, are simply a drain on the state budget and would benefit
from private ownership. If the government failed to find a private sector
buyer for loss-making companies, Barea would favour shutting them down.
&quot;The government should not relinquish control of companies in strategic
sectors, but this can be retained through a small shareholding like in the
French model,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
The banks were quick to catch the scent of privatization in the air. In
the past few weeks, savings bank La Caixa, along with Banco Santander and
Argentaria, spent Pta46 billion to acquire significant shareholdings in
oil and gas company Repsol as well as Endesa, both prime privatization candidates.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It looks like the government's strategy is to privatize the larger
state-owned assets through IPOs and find buyers for the smaller ones that
need to be restructured,&quot; says SBC Warburg's Jorge Calvet.<p>

<H3> BRAZIL </H3>


<H2> <B>It's time to bite the bullet</B> </H2> 

<a href="em.96.09.16b.html"> Cost-cutting takes a private road </b></a>

<H4> <B>Brazil's finances are
being taken in hand. But fiscal reform depends on constitutional changes, and so
far president Cardoso hasn't fulfilled any of his promises. The team implementing
the Real Plan for recovery believes some measures can be taken without a battle
in congress, but these ideas are still on paper. Although inflation is down,
external investment is up and privatization has sped up, the markets will give
Brazil only so long. Danielle Robinson reports</B> </H4> 

<P> Brazil's Real Plan
celebrated its second birthday in July, but still without the constitutional
fiscal reform needed to achieve sustained strong economic growth in a low
inflationary environment. Is it time to panic?

<P> The answer is no &#173; at least not for some time. Although the 1995 fiscal
balance was a shocker &#173; there was a deficit of 5% of GDP, compared with
1994's 1.3% operational surplus &#173; president Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
economic team began preparing years ago for a long battle with congress.

<P> The team say the government's top priority is a reduction in the fiscal
deficit, now that it has successfully reduced monthly inflation to below 1.5% and
is on target for annual inflation this year of between 13% and 14%. This is
Brazil's lowest in 39 years &#173; it was 23.2% in 1995 and 941.3% in 1994.

<P> Reducing the fiscal deficit is possible, the team argues, even without
constitutional reform. They claim to have a list of more than 30 measures that do
not involve constitutional change that can be taken to reduce wage and social
security costs. These, in combination with a visibly accelerated privatization
programme and a new series of IMF-style contracts with state governments, should
reduce the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) operational deficit to
around 3% of GDP this year, compared with 3.5% in the first half of 1996, and
continue reducing it thereafter. The forecast for this year's nominal GDP is
around R740 billion ($748 billion).

<P> But so far this year Cardoso has failed to get any significant constitutional
reforms through, and there's precious little he can do in the next few months,
given municipal elections in October and November. The social security reform has
advanced the furthest through congress this year, but it has been watered down to
the point of irrelevance in the lower house. It is being debated in the senate
again, but it is expected that senators will try to amend changes made in the
chamber of deputies and return it to the lower house for another round of votes.
Presidential elections in 1998 mean Cardoso only has 1997 in which to count on
the full attention of congress. But it will probably take years of incremental
moves towards constitutional reform before he will be able to cross the bulk of
items off his wish list. That's understandable, given how big the task is.

<P> "There are many things that could be done at the federal, state and municipal
levels without constitutional reform," says Gustavo Franco, director of
international affairs at the central bank of Brazil and one of the principal
architects of the Real Plan.

<P> Many of the measures are hardly worth mentioning, say economists, because of
the barely perceptible dent they would make in Brazil's projected R250 billion
net public sector stock of debt this year. But although their efforts are not
likely to grab headlines, they could have an impact on market sentiment. A
crucial objective is to show markets that every effort is being made to rectify
the imbalance. "The passing of a constitutional amendment, or even an ordinary
law, issues a political blueprint for everyone doing things that have a political
cost, but also a good alibi. Constitutional reform works much more as political
agenda setting," says Franco.

<P> Now the onus is on the economic team to come up with the goods, but they must
face the fact that not all of their measures will see the light of day.
Nevertheless, they argue that even with a modicum of success they will be able to
keep the fiscal deficit under control and so buy themselves more time to
implement constitutional change.

<P> "I am confident that even without constitutional reform we will have fiscal
accounts under control and on a downward trend," says Murilo Portugal, treasury
secretary. "It's just that if we have constitutional reform we can have a much
more effective fiscal policy. Then you will see a much higher rate of growth in
Brazil &#173; like 6% a year. Without reform we cannot achieve this." The
economic members' expectations are that, in the medium term, Brazil can grow in
the 3% to 4% range without reform.

<P> A return to 50% a month inflation and widespread indexation is not in the
picture, says Jose Roberto Mendonca de Barros, the government's highly respected
secretary of national economic policy. "I am not a public servant. I used to be a
consultant of the financial sector and I came to the government because I believe
this plan has every chance of stabilizing the country," he says. "Quite frankly,
I am much more confident now than in the beginning; I am absolutely sure, even
from a political point of view, that we are past the point of no return. Every
economic agent in this country is past the point of no return. Even if their
particular interest groups are suffering from the adjustment process they know
that we have to go forward; we cannot go back."

<P> Independent surveys indicate that the vast majority of Brazilian businesses
support the Plan and are highly critical of congressmen who obstruct
constitutional reform. The most recent state elections showed that the most
successful governors at the polls were those who supported the Real Plan or
austere fiscal and monetary measures. However, there's clearly a long way to go
before such political rhetoric turns into more congressional votes for president
Cardoso's proposals.

<P> Putting a positive spin on things is obviously in the economic team's
interest, but it seems bankers and corporate investors are also confident that if
the team members keep the fiscal deficit, inflation and the trade balance under
control over the next few years the markets will be willing to finance shortfalls
until more sweeping constitutional fiscal change is enforced.

<P> <B>Cautiously bullish</B>

<P> The feeling is that Brazil is gaining the confidence of the world's leading
corporates, and this is supported by a record R4.96 billion of direct foreign
investment inflows in the first half of 1996 &#173; 51% up on a year ago and up
from all of 1995's R2.97 billion. Expectations are that direct foreign investment
will hit R8 billion by the year-end.

<P> "Although we believe fiscal concerns are well taken ... we assess these risks
to be much smaller than what some think," says Dan Dorrow, manager of Latin
American economics at Merrill Lynch in New York. "Our view is that the hurdle to
fiscal stability is much lower than is commonly believed and that Brazil is
moving towards rather than away from a stable debt-to-GDP ratio."

<P> No-one expects Brazil to hurtle towards a Mexico-style currency crisis.
Although the real is overvalued, overvaluation is probably of the order of 15%
&#173; not the 40% that has been suggested by some economists. Brazil also has a
3% current account deficit, compared with Mexico's 8%, and at $58 billion its
international reserves are more than three times its monetary base.

<P> "We know there will be some bumps along the road ahead," says Jack Purnell,
chairman and chief executive officer of Anheuser-Busch International, which this
year established a joint venture with Antarctica, Brazil's leading beverage
producer. "However, the beer and soft-drink industries have shown reasonable
historical stability in their profits, and our partner's profits should grow as
we exchange best practices with Antarctica." Like others, Anheuser-Busch is
betting that the huge returns possible in Brazil can exceed the effects of even
worst-case exchange rate and inflation scenarios. With vibrant sectors like
telecoms &#173; where demand for product is so huge that phone lines sell for
R2000 each on the black market &#173; fears of a Mexico-style collapse have been
pummelled in the rush.

<P> "We think they will get further constitutional reforms through over the next
few years and keep things on track in the meantime," says William Romary, Latin
American economist at UBS Securities in New York. "We believe that constitutional
reforms are key to realigning their fiscal imbalance. Brazil's policy mix is
ill-conceived, but the adverse consequences of that mix are more likely to be
felt over the medium or long term, rather than in the near term. We're not ready
to throw in the towel yet."

<P> As a result, investors have this year changed their own deadline for Brazil's
success. At the beginning of 1995, when Cardoso began his term, the general
expectation was that he would push through at least some significant
constitutional reform in his first year in office. If he did not, it was felt,
surely things would quickly unravel. But 18 months later there have been no major
constitutional changes, apart from a sudden rush of amendments last year that
opened up sectors such as waterways, telecommunications, ports and petroleum to
private competition.

<P> Indeed, some observers harbour vague feelings that Brazil's stabilization
plan could jump off track within, say, two years if sufficient fiscal reform
cannot be accomplished. Although the debt to GDP ratio at 33% is low compared
with OECD standards, Brazil's short history of economic stability makes markets
more unforgiving of even the slightest signs of deterioration.

<P> Without fiscal reform the Real Plan is only half complete &#173; as the
economic team have been at pains to stress all along. "We don't need any foreign
professor telling us the importance of fiscal balance," snaps Gustavo Franco,
referring to MIT's professor Rudiger Dornbusch, who believes the real is
overvalued by as much as 40% and predicts a Mexico-style crisis. "It's something
we emphasized even before we started with the Real Plan."

<P> One of the essential economic problems is that the current combination of
tight monetary policy and loose fiscal policy is ultimately unsustainable. The
economic team have kept the mix thus far only because they have had no choice.
Real interest rates have dropped from a 1995 annual 30% to around 15%. And,
judging from futures prices, the rate is expected to fall to between 12% and 14%
by the end of 1996. Even so, rates are still cripplingly high. Apart from the
effects on the private sector and GDP growth, high interest rates mean servicing
public-sector debt is more expensive &#173; which is all the more dangerous in
the absence of fiscal restraint. "If you do nothing to reduce the fiscal deficit
and it continues to increase, then interest rates will increase further; you
could fall into a debt trap where the debt and the interest rates feed on one
another," says Marcelo Carvalho, an economist at JP Morgan in Sao Paulo. "To
avoid this is one of the challenges right now in Brazil."

<P> Interest rates have to stay high in Brazil because together with a strong
real they are the main anchors of inflation, but this also means a high GDP
growth rate cannot be achieved without bumping into inflationary concerns and
worsening trade deficits. If the government could get through constitutional
reform &#173; in particular administrative reform so it can cut its wage bill,
retrench public workers and overhaul its public-sector social security system
&#173; it would be able to purge Brazil of inflationary expectations and make
room for lower interest rates.

<P> The market consensus for Brazil's GDP growth rate this year is between 2.75%
and 2.8%. Unemployment, although officially at 5.9% and expected to remain stable
for the rest of the year, cannot be eased further because of stifled economic
growth. Union estimates, which include the informal economy, indicate that
unemployment in the city of Sao Paulo is closer to 16%.

<P> <B>Ways to trim the deficit</B>

<P> With fiscal restrictions imposed by the constitution, the markets have been
at a loss to know what the government can do to improve the so-called primary
balance, which collates all (PSBR) expenditures, not including real interest
payments on debt.

<P> The net public-sector stock of debt in Brazil was R207 billion in 1995 and is
forecast to be at least R250 billion in 1996; it will increase so long as the
flow of debt continues. Although the government recognizes that it cannot wipe
out fiscal deficit without constitutional reform, it claims that it can slow the
deficit's growth rate, keeping it within the European average of 4% to 5% nominal
deficit. Brazil's public-sector nominal deficit was a little over 7% in 1995 and
is expected to be between 5% and 5.7% in 1996.

<P> Owing to its long history of high inflation, Brazil always refers to its
deficit in operational terms. The PSBR operational fiscal deficit includes all of
the costs of the states and municipalities, the federal government (including the
treasury, central bank and the general social security system), the state and
federally owned enterprises and real interest payments on debt. Take off the real
interest payments and you have the so-called primary balance.

<P> The government is working in three areas that do not involve constitutional
change to reduce the fiscal deficit: raising revenues and cutting expenditures to
cut its own central government costs; speeding up privatization of state and
federally owned enterprises; and encouraging privatization at the state and
municipal government level and gaining at least some control over fiscal
behaviour at these levels by getting the states to sign separate IMF-style
contracts. Treasury secretary Portugal has concentrated for the last few years on
trying to bring Brazil's 26 state governments into such contracts with the
federal government. So far about 19 have committed themselves, says Portugal.

<P> The PSBR operational fiscal deficit blew out in fiscal year 1995 because of a
jump in payrolls and pension costs, mainly at central government level. These
were caused by increases in the minimum monthly wage from R70 to R100; this in
turn increased the general population's social security benefits, which are tied
to the minimum wage. There were also increases in public servants' wages, and the
number of people in the federal public service applying for retirement soared in
1995 in expectation of reforms: applications to retire from the federal public
service increased from 21,765 in 1994 to 36,918 in 1995.

<P> The reason for this jump, therefore, was a spending spree rather than a
revenue shortfall. Real interest payments accounted for about a quarter of the
fiscal deterioration in 1995.

<P> For the federal government, primary-balance deterioration was about double
the increase in real interest payments, whereas for the state and local
governments these two elements contributed about equally. Although the federal
government was the largest source of 1995's fiscal deterioration, state and local
governments were by far the greatest contributors to the overall operational
deficit in 1995: they accounted for about 56% as against 27% from the federal
government and 17% from state companies.

<P> This year the federal government is estimating a substantially improved PSBR
deficit of around 3% of GDP. Market estimates are for a 3.6% deficit for 1996,
decreasing to around 3% by the end of 1997.

<P> The reason for this year's significant improvement is almost entirely the
halving of real interest rates in 1996 over 1995. Although the drop is welcome,
the heat is now on for the economic team to find ways of cutting huge chunks of
cost out of the total public sector's primary balance. JPM's Carvalho explains:
"We saw real interest rates drop from 30% to 15% this year. You obviously cannot
further reduce interest rates by another 15% in real terms going into 1997, so
further improvements in the fiscal deficit must come from a reduction in the
so-called primary balance."

<P> That means raising revenues and cutting expenditures at state and federal
levels.

<P> Brazil's total tax take is historically very strong, at around 30% of GDP in
1995. Federal revenues rose about 10% in 1995, but expenditures at this level
increased faster, at 17%. The federal government's payroll surged 16% in 1995 in
real terms over a year ago: at about R3 billion monthly on an accrual basis, the
payroll last year ran at about 45% of revenue. For some state and local
governments, this ratio was as high as 80%.

<P> Revenue-raising is limited, given that the tax take in Brazil is already
quite high. However, Portugal says there are measures already approved that will
have a fiscal impact, albeit small.

<P> In December, congress approved a change in corporate income tax. The full
gain is estimated at R5.4 billion: the government will get about R2.4 billion in
1996 and R3 billion in 1997. Secondly, through a provisional measure it has
established a 12% social tax on the pensions of retired federal civil servants:
this will show in the fiscal accounts in September and will ultimately contribute
an annual R1.8 billion. Congress has also unified the tax rate between
self-employed workers and other workers; now the self-employed contribute 20%
rather than 10% of their monthly pay as social security payments. This will raise
about R1.2 billion a year. Finally, congress has approved a financial levy called
the CPMF tax, which will raise $4.8 billion a year.

<P> In other revenue measures, state-owned enterprises have increased some public
tariffs such as petrol, gas, electricity and telecommunications, which are
effective immediately.

<P> Further measures are planned. The government hopes to rule that tariffs
should be indexed to future, rather than past inflation, so that tariffs will
rise in real terms.

<P> <B>Crackdown on slow payers</B>

<P> The government will also try to limit the legal right to delay tax payments,
which is a very popular strategy during periods of high inflation. By achieving
this it hopes to recover unpaid taxes amounting to about R8 billion. "Even if we
can recoup a small part of this it will be a good result," says Mendonca de
Barros. He adds that attempts will be made to do away with similar
payment-delaying tactics in the social security system. "The legal structure is
pretty much the same," he explains. "There are a series of procedures which in
practice can enable an enterprise to delay its contribution to the social
security system for his employees by more than five or six years."

<P> The impact of these revenue measures, however, is tiny compared with
expenditure. And many of the revenues will be subject to transfer to the states.
Portugal says the impact will be around a 1% real rate of revenue growth in 1996
compared with 1995, rising to about 6% in 1997.

<P> The economic team's challenge is more to downsize the public sector, which
will improve the fiscal figures at the state level. "That's why privatization is
so important," says Mendonca de Barros. "We can significantly reduce the size of
the public sector [in the absence of constitutional reform] only through
privatization, and that's why we are pushing very strongly in that direction."

<P> Privatization can have enormous benefits in reducing the wage bill. Take, for
example, the federal railway privatization currently under way. The government
has already leased two federal railway network concessions and will have leased
all five by March 1997, by which time it will have reduced the railway public
servant workforce to just 400 from 45,000. "We also expect that the real cost of
transportation will be reduced, and that is extremely important in improving the
efficiency of our export industries, especially agriculture and mining," says
Mendonca de Barros.

<P> Apart from privatization, the economic team has defined 30 measures that can
reduce the wage bill without constitutional reform. The team would not divulge
the contents &#173; unsurprisingly given the imminence of the municipal
elections. However, it's believed they are generally aimed at encouraging
voluntary retirements, reducing the hours worked per day, and reducing the
so-called vegetative growth of the wage bill caused by such factors as automatic
promotion through the ranks.

<P> <B>Cutting down on non-lifers</B>

<P> Not all public servants, for instance, fall under the 1988 constitutional
stipulation that public employees get lifetime job guarantees. That applies only
to those who had been in a government job for at least five years before the
constitution's enactment.

<P> It is estimated that about 55,000 of the central government's 600,000
employees are not covered by this guarantee. If the government were to begin
voluntary retirement programmes for these employees it could cut its wage bill by
5%. That might not sound much, but its effect is considerable, because the
federal government's wage bill is about half its total expenditure. A far greater
number of these "non-lifers" are employed by the states, and the government is
providing certain states with funds to pay for voluntary retirement programmes.

<P> The government cannot cut wages, but it can erode them by not awarding new
wage increases. "We did not give any pay rises in January this year. If you take
inflation from January to June at 21% and factors such as the vegetative growth
in the wage bill, you will see that it will cost us 17% less in wages in January
1996 compared with January 1995. Over a year the gains equate to about 9.7%,
taking into account an estimated inflation rate of 13% by the end of this year."

<P> In terms of current expenditures &#173; those costs associated with the
day-to-day running of federal government &#173; the team claims it can find ways
to ensure that ministries spend R10 billion less than the R26 billion congress
approved in the 1996 fiscal year. And by cutting down primary expenditures the
public sector will also reduce its interest charges.

<P> Portugal adds that the effects of fiscal policy take longer to show even than
monetary policy, often running years into the future. This also means that
further interest rate reductions this year will still have some effects in 1997.

<P> There are reasons to believe that other elements that caused a blowout in the
wage bill will not persist. The number of public servants applying for retirement
should decrease to normal levels and there will not be such large payout
adjustments to account for inflation. Another way to cut the wage bill is to
reduce the bonuses civil servants are awarded when they retire, which can be as
high as 20% of their salary.

<P> The government is also drafting a bill which includes measures it can
implement to cut the general social security bill without constitutional reform.

<P> Brazil's governments are constitutionally prohibited from sacking public
servants except in extremis, cutting nominal wages, cutting social security
payouts, changing the retirement age or reducing the level of revenue transfers
to the states.

<P> As a result it has public servants with lifetime job security and
public-sector retirees  receiving their full salaries on retirement. In the
general social security system, where the employer pays a certain percentage to
the government and then the state provides retirement funds, certain retirees can
pass on their pensions &#173; which can be the same as their final salaries
&#173; to their spouses if they die; and if the spouse dies the children then
receive the pension until they reach the age of 20.

<P> The retirement laws are so generous that after 30 years of service for males
and 25 years for females, private-sector workers can opt for early retirement
with pensions of 70% of the average of their last 36 monthly salaries, plus 6%
extra for every year they have worked beyond that before they hit the normal 35
years, and 30 years of service to be eligible for 100% of the average.

<P> That means that someone who started working at 14 can retire at 39 (females)
and 44 (males) on 70% of a full salary or at 44 and 49 years for females and
males respectively on 100% of full salary. Teachers and professors can always
retire after 30 years (male) and 25 years (female) and get pensions equal to 100%
of their salaries. Those working in stipulated harsh jobs, such as coal-mining,
can retire at full salary after 15 years' service. Although the law should cover
only those who do hard labour, office-bound engineers are also retiring early,
claiming they are working in a harsh sector.

<P> Brazilians can also retire at 65 (males) and 60 (females) in urban areas and
60 and 55 in rural regions on the same average of their last 36 monthly salaries
if they have been employed for the last seven years. In other words, they can get
their full wage as a pension even if they have only contributed to the social
security system for the previous seven years.

<P> <B>Cultivating the system</B>

<P> These rules include everyone, regardless of whether they make R1000 or
R10,000 a month. Anyone who has at any time lived in a rural area can add those
years on as years of service  even though they didn't contribute to the social
security system at the time because they were sons and daughters of farmers doing
the usual family household chores. Around 70% of Brazil's population has lived in
a rural area at some point and the government has found 300,000 pensioners who
have spuriously counted their early days on the family farm as years of service,
even though they are doctors, politicians, lawyers and other professionals with
no connection to rural work.

<P> Although there's little the government can do, there are some ways of
reducing the anomalies. For instance, although it cannot change the age of
retirement or the length of service required for retirement without changing the
constitution, it can propose legislation reducing the 70% of full salary early
retirees receive as pensions. Although the effect would be small &#173; about
R300 million to R600 million a year &#173; it would reduce the incentive for
early retirement. There are also moves to set up a team of 300 specially trained
doctors to audit claims of permanent incapacitation: more than R6 billion a year
goes on social security benefits to people claiming they are unable to work for
the rest of their lives, and preliminary audits have suggested that about 20% of
these are spurious claims.

<P> The social security ministry is also moving to crack down on evasions of
social security contributions by Brazil's top corporates, which preliminary
audits suggest could be as high as 25% per year among about 1.5 million
companies.

<P> <B>Cutting with kindness</B>

<P> The government is also pushing public enterprises to embark on their own
downsizing. Petrobras for instance, has cut its workforce by almost 10,000, from
58,000 to 49,000, in the past two years. However, because of their very nature,
actions that downsize the government and cut general and public service pensions
will not be something the team will be anxious to publicize, in deference to the
unions.

<P> The most complicated effort involves introducing fiscal austerity measures at
the state and local government level. Treasury secretary Portugal and the
economic team have been trying to strike agreements with the states ever since
they came to Brasilia. They strengthened the process last January by introducing
lines of credit agreements similar to the IMF's own country agreements, whereby
the government offers states three different lines of credit in return for their
meeting certain fiscal targets.

<P> The first line of credit gives the states funds with which they can pay
arrears in their wages bills; the second provides them with funds for
retrenchment programmes of public servants not covered under the lifetime
employment guarantee; and the third provides them with medium-term funding
enabling them to pay off extraordinarily high short-term loans they receive from
their state banks in lieu of future revenues.

<P> The process is a formal one and the federal government sends what is called a
treasury mission to the state that wants to join the programme. The team is led
by treasury and administrative representatives who determine how the state can
cut its wage bill. Representatives from national development bank Banco Nacional
de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social (BNDES) also join the mission to determine
what can be privatized and how. After 10 days in the state, the mission prepares
a report recommending measures that could be taken to improve the fiscal
situation.

<P> "The aim is to have, in a three-year period, the state generating a primary
surplus, which in turn helps it achieve an operational balance," says Portugal.
"So far we have signed agreements with 19 of the 26 states. We have given them
R2.2 billion. Of course, like all human action, it will not have a 100% success
rate, but I don't think it will have a zero success rate, either: some states are
doing very well, such as Rio Grande do Sul. We gave them finance to begin
voluntary retrenchments. They had already laid off 15,000 employees by last May,
which is 6% of their total public workforce. Four other states have also begun
similar programmes and are receiving lines of credit under their agreement [with
the federal government] to pay for the severance cost."

<P> The federal government is enticing the states to take up many other measures.
Sometimes these have small fiscal effects, but they are important because they
sow the seed of fiscal reform at the state level. Another example is CESP, the
Sao Paulo electricity utility, which earlier this year made its debut in the
Deutschmark Eurobond market after receiving a guarantee on that issue from the
Republic of Brazil. The aim of the issue was to improve the company's debt
profile ahead of privatization &#173; by using 100% of the proceeds of the issue
to pay off debt it owed the federal government.

<P> Ultimately, the bet investors have to take with Brazil is whether Cardoso
will be able to push through constitutional reform. Some commentators argue he's
not screaming loud enough: "It's all too much a process of trying to accommodate
different interests, which is the typical way of Brazil," says Francisco Gros,
chairman of Morgan Stanley Brazil and the former Brazilian central bank president
during president Fernando Collor de Mello's administration. "The states are not
being given any really hard choices. It's all just carrots and no sticks."

<P> Gros was referring in particular to the federal government's recently
announced rescue plan for ailing state-owned banks. This will provide 100% of the
financing needed to restructure debt of banks being privatized, liquidated or
turned into development banks. It also offers to refinance up to half the debt
held by state banks whose governments decide to keep control of their banks.

<P> Although Gros and many others have criticized the plan for sending an all-too
lenient message to the states, the deal is realistic and goes some way to
breaking the stand-off between the states and the government over the future of
their state banks. Sao Paulo's state bank Banespa, for instance, is owed R20
billion by its state owner, but in spite of its collapse it has still not been
privatized or taken out of the state's hands.

<P> After the announcement of the new measures, the state of Minas Gerais reached
an agreement with the federal government to receive nearly R700 million in loans
needed for the privatization of its state bank, Credireal. The Rio de Janeiro
state government is also going to participate in the plan for privatization of
state bank Banerj. Taking the state banks out of the hands of the state
governments will take away one of the biggest sources of fiscal corruption in
Brazil.

<P> The plan may not have a 100% success rate, but these days in Brazil, you grab
what you can get.

<H3> BRAZIL </H3>


<H2> <B>Cost-cutting takes a private road</B> </H2> 

<a href="em.96.09.16a.html"> It's time to bite the bullet </b></a>

<H4> <B>Brazil's
privatization programme has been given a new lease of life. With no fiscal
constitutional reform in sight, the government has accelerated the sale of the
biggest public utilities as the best way to downsize the public sector. And
that's vital if the Real Plan is to stay afloat</B> </H4> 

<P> "Privatization is
so important because downsizing the government is the only way we can reduce our
debt and improve the fiscal situation," says Jose Roberto Mendonca de Barros, the
secretary of national economic policy and one of the most senior members of
president Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic team. "We continue to have
constraints imposed on us constitutionally, and congress continues to make it
difficult for us to get through constitutional reforms."

<P> The privatization law came into force in 1990, but only industrial sectors
&#173; the "easy" privatizations &#173; have been sold off. Brazil has yet to
sell any utilities.

<P> So far 45 companies have been sold, for total values of anything between R8
million ($8.1 million) and &#173; in the case of Light Sesa, the Rio de
Janeiro-based electricity distribution company auctioned in May &#173; R2
billion. About 66% of the amount paid for Light Sesa was in cash, the biggest
cash amount of any Brazilian privatization so far. So far, privatization proceeds
total R12.3 billion, but only a small proportion has been paid in cash. The
figure rises to R16.8 billion if the transfer of debt from the public to the
private sector is included.

<P> Privatization proceeds have soared this year in particular (R2.73 billion in
the first five months, compared with a record R2.6 billion in all of 1993). But
this is small compared with the tens of billions of dollars that could be raised
if the utilities owned by the states and the federal government were sold off.
For instance, mining conglomerate Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), is alone
worth about R10 billion.

<P> Moreover, for a debt-laden country the fiscal effects of selling parts of the
public sector is significant. A small example is the leasing of the federal
government's five railway network concessions. Already two have been leased to
private companies to manage and operate. The concession to operate the
south-eastern section of the network, whose minimum price has been set at R888.9
million, will be auctioned on September 20. The sale of the entire concession
will be completed by March next year. At the end of 1994 the federal railway
system employed 45,000 people and recorded an annual loss of R350 million, with
accumulated debt of R3.3 billion. "By March 1997, when we expect the entire
railway privatization process to be completed, we will have only 400 public
servants working in the federal railway system, just in an administrative
capacity to receive the rents from the new operators leasing the networks," says
Mendonca de Barros. The rents will be about R1.5 billion a year. "The new
operators will invest another R1 billion, at present value, in track and
equipment."

<P> About 20 thermal and hydroelectric generating plants owned by Eletrobras are
scheduled for privatization in late 1996 and 1997. Also in 1997 the government
will tender for consultants to advise on how best to sell Eletrobras's four
regional subsidiaries: Furnas, Eletrosul, Chesf and Eletronorte. Moves to sell
Furnas will begin in late 1997, with a view to selling it in 1988. By the end of
the privatization process the government is expected to have sold off all its 48%
stake in Eletrobras. Based on market estimates, that could raise about R8 billion
to R9 billion.

<P> The government has also included 31 port concessions on the privatization
list, which are due for sale in 1997 and 1998.

<P> <B>Cellular consultation</B>

<P> Before the end of 1996 national development bank Banco Nacional de
Desenvolvimento Economico e Social (BNDES) will have issued the terms and
conditions of the bidding process for consultant tenders on the first of about 10
B-band cellular telephone leases due for sale in 1997. The privatization process
to sell Telebras-controlled A-band cellular licences will also begin late next
year with a view to beginning their sale in 1988. As far as the restructuring and
privatization of Telebras is concerned, the corporate restructuring should also
gain momentum in 1997. The privatization of Telebras might take more time because
the government doesn't want to be aggressive in privatizing other basic services,
and so it will initially focus more on the cellular side.

<P> By far the biggest upcoming privatization is CVRD, the federally owned mining
conglomerate. In February 1997, 45% of its voting shares held by the government
will be sold to a controlling consortium, and 10% will be sold to employees
immediately afterwards. In June the government's remaining 20% stake will be sold
as part of a global offering. This is expected to be the biggest privatization
deal in Latin America since Argentine oil and gas company Yacimientos
Petroliferos Fiscales' (YPF) $3 billion initial public offering in 1993.

<P> The accelerated privatization plans follow a genuine change in the minds of
the public and politicians. "In the past people criticized the very fact that we
were privatizing," says Irima da Silveira, assistant chief of privatization at
BNDES. "A lot of political parties and unions are against privatization. The
criticism now is that we are not going fast enough. People accept it and want it
to be done quicker."

<P> Optimism that things are definitely picking up speed on the privatization
front has been raised not just by the announcement of the CVRD and Eletrobras
sales, but also by the fact that after years of preparation and passage through
various committees the government has legal frameworks in place for concessions
which it can transfer far more quickly to other sectors.

<P> The government is also moving to develop regulatory blueprints, as well as
regulatory bodies, to govern utilities and sectors such as telecoms and
electricity. BNDES has hired consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand to help the
central government decide on further regulatory and operational changes in the
electricity industry. It's likely that Brazil will define market rules based on
UK experience, since this is the best model for electricity privatization, rate
reduction and improved services and competitiveness.

<P> A law known as the minimum regulation for telecommunications has already been
passed by congress, but it touches only on satellite and cellular services. The
creation of a regulatory body for the telecoms industry as a whole is under
consideration. Only two years ago the federal government could not even mention
Telebras and privatization in the same breath. Now the possibility of privatizing
the telecoms networks, including Telebras subsidiaries such Telerj and Telesp, is
at least being discussed.

<P> A proposal on how the telecoms regulatory body will be structured has already
been drafted, and this is currently being considered by congressional
commissions. Regulatory bodies for both electricity and telecoms are expected to
be set up by mid-1997. These will be essential to the reduction of sector risk
and will make it easier for would-be buyers of state-owned entities to predict
future earnings flows.

<P> "The process is gaining momentum and will continue to gain pace because we
have seen developments on the regulatory side as well as the general framework
for concessions law being put in place," says Marcelo Audi, head of equity
research at Patrimonio, a Sao Paulo brokerage affiliated with Salomon Brothers.
"These things can take many years &#173; it took more than two years for the
federal railway concession sales to get going, for instance &#173; but now it is
in place. We have the blueprint for other sectors."

<P> Also, for the first time in many years politicians are, as a matter of
self-interest, politically motivated to speed up the process. They realize now
that growth lies in boosting the private sector. The public sector's flabbiness
is hindering private-sector growth, and waving the privatization flag is
politically advantageous. "This is the first time in more than a decade that
publicly run infrastructure is becoming a bottleneck for sustainable growth in
the country," says Audi, "so it's in the political interest to attract growth in
the next few years." It's estimated that the electricity sector and the telecoms
sector will require respective investments totalling R30 billion and R40 billion
between now and 2000.

<P> Quite apart from the need for growth, state governments and federal
politicians are realizing that they won't be able to afford to pay for their past
excesses without privatization. The state governments saw concrete evidence of
the benefits of selling assets in May when BNDES sold Light Sesa. "In the wake of
the Light auction, state governments in Brazil seem increasingly interested in
selling their utility assets," says Paul Parshley, equity analyst at Lehman
Brothers. "During our meetings in Brazil with utility companies and state
government officials, we found intense interest in learning more about
international utilities and IPPs [independent power producers] that might want to
invest funds in Brazilian utilities."

<P> <B>Energy sales</B>

<P> Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro have gone farthest down this road. Sao Paulo is
selling four energy companies: CESP, Eletropaulo CPFL and Fepasa. Those four will
be split into 18 subsidiaries by activity: generation, transmission and
distribution. CPFL is expected to be sold first, followed by some of CESP's
unfinished installations. The proceeds will be used to pay off the companies'
debt. The advisory mandates for CPFL and Eletropaulo were due to be opened for
bidding and the state government is keen for the first sales to occur in the
second quarter of 1997.

<P> Rio is privatizing its state bank under the new federal government bank
privatization incentive programme, as well as six other state-owned companies:
CERJ, CEG, Conerg, Flumitrens, Metro and Cedae. Gas company CEG is one of the
biggest to be sold off. It will be evaluated by December this year and ready for
privatization in March. Capitaltec Consultoria Economica, a Rio-based firm, and
investment bank Deutsche Morgan Grenfell have the advisory mandate.

<P> Others up for concessions sales, or partial or full privatization for 1997
and 1998 include CRT (in Rio Grande do Sul), Coelba (Bahia); Cosern (Rio Grande
do Norte) Celguge Cachoeira Dourada (Goias); Energipe (Sergipe); Cemar (Maranhao)
Cemat (Mato Grosso); Enersul (Mato Grosso do Sul); Celpa (Para) and Ceron
(Rondonia).

<P> BNDES is also pushing certain states to speed up privatization programmes, by
advancing funds to state governments and state utilities for investment and debt
reduction. In return it expects the states to move forward with plans to sell
utility assets or shares of state-controlled utilities. "A condition of these
loans enables the BNDES to take control of the privatization process if the state
drags its feet, which is a contingency the states would try to avoid," says
Parshley.

<H3>FOREIGN EXCHANGE</H3> 
<H2>Gearing up the tandem </H2>
<H4>The combination of Chase and Chemical always held the prospect of creating
a foreign-exchange giant able to challenge Citibank's number-one position.
But for the former Chemical managers - who dominate the new operation
- the tough challenge will be to integrate the two banks' very different
styles: can the old Chase's customer-oriented salesmen pedal at the same
speed as Chemical's traders? By Steven Irvine </H4>
<B>April 9, 1996.</B> Dawn is breaking over London. Down by the Thames in
Vintners Place, weary technicians, who've worked 28 hours non-stop, are
coaxing into normality the last of a bunch of temperamental computer feeds.
Eight months of planning and a four-day Easter weekend of frenetic activity
are about to reach their climax. <BR>
<BR>
The trading-room is switched on almost without a hitch. Worldwide, the integration
of 28 trading centres of the former Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank passes
off smoothly as foreign-exchange dealing starts. By 8 am the most serious
remaining problem involves two traders who find themselves sharing an intercom.
And chief economist Robin Marshall discovers that the logo on his wall -
the important backdrop for television interviews - is from pre-merger
days. This is the new Chase, reborn in the old Chase Manhattan's London
foreign exchange headquarters. <BR>
<BR>
But observers might be forgiven for thinking they had stumbled into the
former Chemical Bank operation. That's because most of the bosses in London
now are Chemical alumni. Few former Chase Manhattan personnel are left on
their old trading-floor. Many of the traders and salespeople had gone before
the Easter break, some of their own volition, others victims of the cost-cutting
exercise that had driven the merger. The combined front-office staff of
800 has been cut by one-fifth. A poster placed on the men's toilet door
before Easter and featuring a forlorn-looking giraffe - a spoof of
a British Airways advertisement - summed up the situation with the
question: Where is everyone? <BR>
<BR>
It was never going to be simple to put together two foreign exchange operations
so different in their styles. Chemical was the trader-driven top player
in the interbank market, Chase a sales-driven outfit dedicated to corporate
relationships. Nevertheless, the opportunities for the combined businesses
are huge and Citibank now has a forex competitor worthy of the name. The
markets can look forward to a battle royal between these two powerhouses.
<BR>
<BR>
The trend in foreign exchange markets is toward ever bigger one-stop shops
able to service customers in everything from dollar/yen to four-year Polish
zloty options. By the millennium only a handful of megabanks are predicted
by many in the industry as likely to have survived the unrelenting pressure.
Chase-Chemical has positioned itself to be one of those survivors, bringing
together the corporate client list of the white-shoe Chase and the high-volume
trading abilities of what even Chemical's rivals grudgingly have acknowledged
as the world's greatest liquidity machine. Chase also brings with it a global
custody franchise that generates - via dividend repatriation, for example
- a steady stream of forex revenue that pre-merger was estimated to
account for around 40% of the whole. <BR>
<BR>
The merged institution, as can be seen from the <I>Euromoney</I> forex poll
(starting on page 62), puts it with Citibank in a super league of two that
leaves the competition trailing. For the new Chase, there's also the carrot
of overturning Citi's 18-year reign at the top. <BR>
<BR>
But heads of foreign exchange at other institutions appear not to be quaking
- at least, not yet. Some even see an opportunity created by what they
describe as the indistinct client bases of the merged US money-centres banks.
<I>Euromoney</I>'s poll shows that 25% of those who voted for Chemical also
voted for Chase. &quot;People keep asking me if I'm scared,&quot; says one
rival forex chief. &quot;I say, 'Sure, it's going to be a megabank, but
I think we should all wait and see how things fall together'.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
That coming together is down to two men who, reassuringly for the new bank,
have seen it all before: Don Layton and Don Wilson. They managed the 1992
merger of the forex operations of Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical. In
that merger, the two banks also had different foreign exchange strengths,
Manufacturers Hanover, like Chase, having better corporate relationships.
Headhunters retain vivid memories of that time: &quot;Within six months,
99.1% of the trading floor was Chemical,&quot; says one. <BR>
<BR>
Wilson and Layton have brought to the latest venture the knowledge that
in terms of integration, speed is of the essence. &quot;We've both done
this before and I see no reason why we can't make it work again but you
try not to make the process destructive,&quot; says Wilson, who has been
with Chemical Bank since 1973 and keeps in the new set-up the title he held
at Chemical: head of global trading. This means he's also head of forex.
<BR>
<BR>
The merger, it seems, is an educational, integrational, organizational,
psychological and behavioural event. &quot;You give people a notion that
the pain of the merger delivers big gains in success,&quot; says Layton,
who entered Chemical via Manufacturers Hanover and is head of capital markets
in the new venture. &quot;You do off-sites to get the merger angst out on
the table and get some of the myths out of the way. Yes, it's difficult
now but it is very much worth it - that's the theme.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Wilson, who trained as a corporate banker, says the trading rooms are the
only places in the new Chase that would know just one week after the merger
how they performed. &quot;Very quickly you get a sense of shared economics,&quot;
he says. &quot;And you get that team beginning to mould itself together
pretty quickly.&quot; So how did they do after week one? &quot;Just fine.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The two institutions, says Wilson, have complementary strengths. &quot;On
the margin, the former Chemical had a stronger emphasis on market-making,
and professional and semi-professional users. On the margin, former Chase
had a much better link to the custody product line, the private banking
side, and on the margin a bigger emphasis on sales as opposed to trading.
But, naturally, both banks could not have achieved what they had independently
without successful emphasis on trading and sales.&quot; In other words,
the potential is large if the two sides can be brought to work in harmony.
<BR>
<BR>
On the Chase side the merger came as a huge surprise. In London, the night
desk was the first to see it come over the wire. A joke, the night deskers
thought, and not a very pleasant one. In New York, so the story goes, Chase
chairman and chief executive officer Tom Labrecque was booed out of the
dealing room a couple of weeks after the announcement. Perhaps with the
Manufacturers-Chemical merger still fresh in the mind, Chase's traders had
the feeling they would not have their seats for long. &quot;Chemical FX
survives in all but the name,&quot; says one now. Soon after the reported
incident, Labrecque moved into Chemical Bank's old Park Avenue headquarters,
now head office for the new operation, as president and chief operating
officer of the merged institution. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Chemical imbalance</B> <BR>
<BR>
Most of the senior positions have gone to former Chemical managers, starting
at the top with Layton and Wilson. The London head is Thomas Hoppe (Chemical).
The head of trading in London is Marc Rimmer (Chemical). The head of New
York is David Puth (Chemical). The head of Tokyo is Yukuo Takahashi (Chemical).
The head of international treasury and general management for Europe -
described by one headhunter as &quot;the matrix head of everything that's
going on in London&quot; - is Bruce Hannan (Chemical). The New York
and London business managers, whose duties include co-ordinating the front
and back offices, are from Chemical. And when the senior middle-management
positions were announced, of the New York trading room's five heads of desk,
only one was from the old Chase. <BR>
<BR>
Not a single member of Chase Manhattan's senior forex management team received
a promotion. David Adamson, former head of global forex in London, was made
head of options and sales co-ordination, a greatly reduced portfolio for
the man to whom everyone reported in the former Chase. In New York, former
US head James Borden was made head of New York sales, reporting to Puth.
He previously had been global head of foreign exchange before Adamson. Kris
Dasgupta, former Chase New York head of sales, is now in charge of the US
multinationals desk. Yoshinobu Hashimoto, former Tokyo head, was given options
trading and sales in Asia. Bashir Gazla, former Chase head trader in London,
became the new combine's deputy forex trading manager but left, taking a
team of five to Scotia Capital Markets. <BR>
<BR>
Adamson's reduced role, announced last October, was the biggest shock. A
legendary, cigar-smoking spot trader, he had been at the centre of the Chase
Manhattan culture, summed up by a customer as: &quot;It seemed like they
enjoyed working in that place and with each other.&quot; Ex-Chase staff
express great personal loyalty toward Adamson, described as a good man-manager.
Now in his late forties, he has been at Chase since he was 16 and would
find it hard to leave - if only because of new UK pension contributions
legislation. <BR>
<BR>
The number of former Chase Manhattan people who have gone suggests a none-too-happy
ship. London accounts for more foreign exchange turnover per day than New
York and Tokyo combined. Chase had 75 front-office staff in the City: 40
traders, 35 sales. Post-merger, the former Chemical trading machine dominates.
Of the current traders, say sources, just seven are from the old Chase operation.
And only 12 remain from the sales team. <BR>
<BR>
On the sales side, it was expected that Chase would dominate, although Wilson
says: &quot;The notion was never to populate the trading side exclusively
with Chemical people, the sales side with Chase people.&quot; Nevertheless,
when the sales team leaders were announced, three out of five in London
were former Chase Manhattan staffers. But the senior appointees did not
stay long. Team leader Brian Dobson, who was to run the flow desk (incorporating
custody and some central banks), went to Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and Guy
Zabelle, another senior corporate sales person, went to Morgan Stanley.
Both must have been flooded with <I>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</I>: both had
left Manufacturers Hanover after its merger with Chemical. Others to leave
the new Chase were Sara Sullivan, who ran options sales, Mel Mayne, who
ran European sales and John Gillies, who reported on a &quot;dotted line&quot;
basis to softly-spoken sales head Warren McLeland but decided to retire.
The only appointed team leader on the sales side to remain from the former
Chase is Julie Jakobek, who runs UK corporate sales. <BR>
<BR>
Global custody sales - the key Chase franchise in both the old and
new operations - is run in New York and London by former Chemical people.
&quot;I would be surprised, at the end of the day, if there are any Chase
people left,&quot; says one headhunter. Lehman Brothers and Smith Barney
are known to be on the prowl for sales heads. <BR>
<BR>
A retention rate of 32% of the salesforce in a big global hub is not encouraging
- especially as the former Chase Manhattan sales people supposedly
are an asset. If a commercial bank bought an investment bank and produced
such a number, analysts would be sending out research notes warning of goodwill
write-downs. <BR>
<BR>
In New York the personnel situation overall has not been as difficult as
in London. From a total of 68 former Chase Manhattan people only 25 have
left, and they are thought to be mainly on the trading side, though among
the departees have been some high-profile personalities, including Mark
Veale - described by a rival salesperson as a &quot;top corporate producer&quot;
- who went to BZW. <BR>
<BR>
Wilson is realistic about the staff situation: &quot;We know. We're in a
trader's world. One of the challenges in the new Chase is that we will be
a preferred shopping centre for jobs.&quot; But he adds: &quot;Some locations
have been less lucky.&quot; He means London. <BR>
<BR>
Susquehanna, the Philadelphia-based options group with which the former
Chase entered into a partnership in March 1992, is another casualty. The
partnership was forged by Mark Grier, now long gone from Chase Manhattan
but then head of global risk management. The move was designed to boost
the bank's presence in both plain-vanilla and exotic options. It did just
that. Overnight, Chase became a major player. The salesforce was keen on
Susquehanna because its eight traders in London and six in New York were
able to offer tight prices in very large volumes. <BR>
<BR>
But Susquehanna was expensive to run. It had, for example, about 10 people
dedicated to systems, all Chase employees, working with traders and required
to look after their specialized technology. And though never disclosed,
Susquehanna's cut of profits, negotiated with Grier, was rumoured to be
in the region of 50%, not dissimilar to the deal that derivatives house
O'Connor had when linked to First Chicago before subsequently being bought
by SBC. A former Chase Manhattan staffer says that Susquehanna was brought
in at a time when the Chase options effort was in such disarray that the
game plan was to create a presence rather than make extraordinary money
- the true fear being that spot FX clients might defect if they could
not get the &quot;full service&quot;. Despite this, he says, profits displayed
healthy growth. <BR>
<BR>
<B>New philosophy</B> <BR>
<BR>
Susquehanna had begun negotiations with David Adamson to renew the agreement
for a further five years when the Chase-Chemical merger was announced. The
negotiations shifted from London to New York and were soon taken over by
Layton and Wilson. But both had other priorities and Susquehanna appears
to have become frustrated by an increasingly drawn-out process. It was not
short of offers and eventually signed up with Bank of New York in a five-year
deal. <BR>
<BR>
This means new head of options Adamson will be managing Chemical traders
with whom he has not previously worked and who certainly have not enjoyed
the same profile as Susquehanna. The Chase options sales team (reputedly
given a guaranteed bonus to stay) will have to adapt too. <BR>
<BR>
Of the epidemic of departures, a New York banker who used to work at Chase
proffers the following reasons: &quot;The salespeople don't feel comfortable
with the new philosophy. It's no longer a customer-friendly pricing machine,
so much as 'this is the price - take it or leave it'.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
About 80% of income at Chase Manhattan was generated through customer business.
Trading was less dominant. In trading-orientated Chemical, however, much
of the customer business was connected with hedge funds and investment banks.
Chemical had a much bigger middle office, almost three times the size of
that at Chase Manhattan - high volumes in the interbank market meant
that Chemical's traders needed a lot of input and error-checking support.
At Chase, the salesforce was also involved in reversals and cancellations
- typically middle-office functions and mundane tasks but very important
to the customer, who preferred the salesperson doing it quickly as opposed
to the process becoming bogged down elsewhere. Chase Manhattan regarded
this activity as part of the customer service. Some of the new Chase's trading
centres adhere to this system, some do not. <BR>
<BR>
Chemical's traders, widely recognized as among the finest in the business,
are said to see salespeople as providing customer flow to aid their own
position-taking. This does not always lead to a spirit of co-operation between
the two groups. The opposite was true at Chase, where the traders and salespeople
were part of the same profit centre and a trader's bonus was based only
in part on financial performance. Trust between traders and salespeople
generated efficiencies too. For example, rather than the salesperson shouting
for a price from a trader, getting that price, recording it in his own responsibility
account then transferring responsibility to the trader to allocate the trade
to his book electronically, as at Chemical, the Chase system allowed the
price to be agreed and for the salesperson to allocate it directly to the
trader's book. <BR>
<BR>
(Even Chemical's system wasn't foolproof. Only days before the trading floors
merged, Chemical had one of its traders arrested for fraud on 12 counts
of making false entries in bank records, which he allegedly had done to
ensure he received his $105,000 bonus. The trader allegedly lost $70 million
in December 1994 on the Mexican peso.) <BR>
<BR>
The reason that many sales staff left was that without the Chase traders
they found it much harder to operate. But at least in the merged operation
there are more salespeople than in the former Chemical team, which surely
signals a change in direction. <BR>
<BR>
At old Chase the strategy was sales, sales, sales. The goal was to become
a top-three bank for any given client, because, on average, the three leaders
took as much as 75% of that client's business. Individual salespeople drew
up business plans because they were encouraged to think of their area as
a Chase franchise. One such plan ran to 65 pages. Clients were visited six
times a year - at the very least - and bonuses were linked to
intangibles such as the level of input on a project finance deal and the
ideas generated to win the mandate, such as structuring currency options.
<BR>
<BR>
A rival head of sales says that while Chemical appears to have taken over
Chase Manhattan, the reverse might seem more appropriate: &quot;Personally
I think Chase is a better bank today. Chemical's been struggling to keep
in the top six in recent surveys. It's not in the top three like it used
to be.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Chase revenues had been growing rapidly in recent years and when figures
for forex profits at both banks were produced it appears that neither institution
had been markedly ahead of the other. But at the old Chase, Adamson did
not have responsibility for generic derivatives - short-term interest-rate
swaps and such like - which for the past seven years Chemical has grouped
with forex. Their inclusion boosted Chemical's figures, especially since
the bank has been very good at trading them. New Chase organizes itself
like Chemical. It no longer has a head of global forex, only a head of global
trading: the Chemical structure which incorporates generic derivatives.
<BR>
<BR>
Wilson, the head of global trading, will be based in New York and will visit
London six times a year. This decision apparently is based on the fact that
New York is where he lives; it is denied that New York will be the global
centre. There isn't one, it seems. <BR>
<BR>
Certainly the new management structure is less &quot;global&quot; than before
and also less global than that of competitors such as Citibank where everyone
reports to Guy Whittaker in London. In new Chase, major hubs report direct
to Wilson while the likes of Frankfurt and Milan do not - they report
to Bruce Hannan, who is general manager of branch and representative office
functions in Europe. As a result, the geography of a trade's execution is
an issue. Suppose, for example, a corporate has a branch in London and Madrid.
In the old Chase it would not have mattered where the trade was booked.
In the new Chase, the head of London foreign exchange, Hoppe, gets the trade
for his profit centre if it is booked in London but Hannan gets it if it
is booked in Madrid. <BR>
<BR>
Despite this, Layton made the decision in November to use Chase's global
settlements and payments technology, probably because it is cheaper and
Chemical did not have a unified system, instead using technology that varied
around the world. However, New York and London already are entering their
trades differently - London in the old Chase way and New York in the
manner of the old Chemical. The system is most cost-effective when it is
used uniformly and though it can cope with being adapted, that rather defeats
the point. <BR>
<BR>
But the new management is not guilty of complacency. Wilson is frank about
the challenges: &quot;If we put these two institutions together properly,
if we rededicate ourselves to aggressive market-making, if the customer
stays as important in the new institution as the old, if we continue to
invest in technology and if we can manage and lead ourselves properly, then
we've got a very good chance of being exceptionally good at what we do.
But, the last thing I would want to do is set a number one ranking as a
goal. This will follow from exceptional professional execution of our strategy.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
What emerges from this year's <I>Euromoney</I> poll is that the new Chase
and Citibank have very different strengths. Chase wins London; nobody comes
close to it in New York; in Tokyo it is the top non-Japanese bank. Citi
is much better in Asia and Latin America and eastern Europe. In the main
&quot;liquidity&quot; currencies - dollar/Deutschmark, dollar/yen,
sterling/dollar, Deutschmark/yen - Chase wins. It also comes top in
lira, peseta and Ecu. Citi leads in emerging-market currencies: Mexican
and Argentine peso, Czech koruna, Brazilian real, among others. Indeed,
Chase does not appear higher than Citi in a single emerging currency. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Size will out</B> <BR>
<BR>
Citibank's dominance in emerging markets is the result of its presence in
94 countries, almost three times the number in which the combined Chase-Chemical
is found. Nor is Citi's $1.1 billion-plus of forex revenues anywhere near
matched by the new Chase, which unfortunately does not publish a figure
for pure forex trading revenues. The nearest approximation, according to
a Chase source, is about $700 million but this includes the contribution
of short-term derivatives. <BR>
<BR>
In the longer term, perhaps, size will be more important than short-term
teething problems such as a departing salesforce. Independent research published
in March by George Salem of Gerard Klauer Mattison, a US brokerage, offers
hope. Salem spoke to 21 treasurers among the leading 150 <I>Fortune 500</I>
companies. He found that 67% of companies would do materially more business
with the new Chase (i.e. one plus one equals more than two) and the remainder
would do approximately the same amount as at present. A sample of the treasurers'
off-the-cuff comments was included, perhaps the most remarkable being: &quot;Before
the merger, Chase was our number two bank and Chemical number four. Now
they will be tied with Citibank for number one. Corporations must now turn
to Chase and Citi as their top banks.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<I>Euromoney</I> conducted its own series of interviews on the same theme.
We asked whether one and one made two. That is to say, whether the votes
cast in our poll for the separate Chase and Chemical would have been cast
in exactly the same way for the new Chase. The bulk of the corporates who
responded, from an oil major to a computer multinational indicated that
they would do less. In the worst case, one plus one equalled 1.25 and on
average 1.5. <BR>
<BR>
A European corporate commented: &quot;We used Chase more, but after the
merger Chemical were very keen on pricing. I could tell they were touting
for more customers.&quot; He continued: &quot;Chase felt more or less like
the underdog. But Chase were better overall. It seemed like the Chase people
enjoyed working in that place, and working with each other.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Many respondents did reply that their relationship was with the institution
- the former Chase - and not with the sales people who have left.
Many, at the time the poll was conducted, were still talking to the same
salespeople. But this should give Layton and Wilson grounds for optimism
and suggest that in the short term, not much will change. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Large corporations and institutions strategically like to direct their
business to strong, surviving, growing, creative wholesale banks,&quot;
says Layton. &quot;They don't want to deal with guys on the C-list or B-list.
Last time [after the Manufacturers Hanover-Chemical merger] we immediately
moved up in people's estimation as a survivor and now it's happening again.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What'll make it easier for Don Wilson's business to grow, in particular,
is one of our strategic thrusts,&quot; says Layton. &quot;We have put an
added emphasis on multinationals that we did not have historically, designating
them as a special industry group.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The end,&quot; he says, &quot;is the marriage of first-rate market-making
around the world with a diversified clientele and the ability to understand
well what's going on in the markets, to take a proprietary view.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Both men favour the middle ground, which they define as &quot;great market-making,
and strong client focus, where the objective is both to serve the client
and the shareholder.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The new bank's ambitions are posted on the sidewalk outside the Park Avenue
HQ - a 20-foot Chase logo, chiselled in granite, presumably for lasting
qualities. Curiously, next to it is a garbage bin which the bank has chosen
to sponsor. Surely there are no self-doubts here? <BR>
<BR>
Not to hear Wilson and Layton. &quot;You can have both,&quot; says Wilson
of the two very different qualities that Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank
bring to the merger. &quot;You can be very good at making prices and be
very good at satisfying customers. I don't think they are mutually exclusive.&quot;
Adds Layton: &quot;There's absolutely nothing that says you can't be great
at market-making and great at sales in FX.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
It is clear that what both mean is that Citibank has not stayed on top for
such a long time without excelling at both activities. <BR>

<H3> KOREA </H3>


<H2> <B>Share hunger that feeds on scandal</B> </H2> 

<a href="em.96.09.17a.html">Living the sham of a free market </b></a>

<H4> <B>Foreign investors
are piling into Korea's stock market. But why? The country seems to have lost its
competitive edge, the stock index has plummeted, and the country's corrupt
practices have been exposed with the guilty verdicts on two former presidents.
Overseas investors, however, are undeterred. They believe profits are there for
those who can stomach the roller-coaster ride</B> </H4>

 <P> On August 3 the share
price of Daesung Resources, a company in the normally underperforming mining
sector on the Korean Stock Exchange (kse), stood at w171,000 ($209.82) &#173;
about nine times its low for 1995.

<P> Daesung shares had been climbing furiously between July 23 and August 2,
hitting the daily permissible upper limit every single trading day. And just
three weeks later, they had slid 35% from their peak. The rush on the shares was
prompted by rumours that the government would permit the coal company to turn its
mine sites into casinos. By mid-August, though, it became clear that the rumours
had been just that. Moreover, analysts began to refer to Daesung as a
<I>chakcheonju</I>, literally a "strategy stock" &#173; strategy in this case
being an imaginative tale spread in order to drive up share prices and hoodwink
gullible investors. In other words, Daesung had been the object of an
old-fashioned ramp.

<P> The Daesung caper is only the most recent indication that transparency is not
one of the Korean stock market's strong points, in spite of highly publicized
official promises to rid the market of unsavoury practices. In fact, on the eve
of South Korea's hoped-for entry into the oecd, the Korean equity market still
appears to maintain a high degree of tolerance for questionable standards of
investor protection, unusual reporting practices by listed corporations, and
capricious interference by bureaucrats.

<P> But the bad news doesn't stop there. This year, Korea's key export industries
were hit by a cyclical downturn, a sudden unfavourable change in exchange rates,
as well as labour unrest. Late last year stock prices plummeted on news that the
country's major business conglomerates had been funnelling hundreds of millions
of dollars in off-the-book payments to two former presidents. And, as if that was
not bad enough, in August the Kospi  (Korea Shares Price Index) was down 20% from
this year's high. The decline is, in large part, the result of too many new
issues hitting the market.

<P> One would think that, given such potential for downside risk, foreign
investors would be dumping their Korean shares at any price. On the contrary, in
spite of the deluge of bad news, foreign investors have increased their
portfolios of Korean stocks by $2.6 billion since April 1, when the ceiling on
foreign shareholding was raised to 18%. For the first six months of the year,
foreign investors increased their net holdings on the kse by $3 billion.
Moreover, in mid-August, many foreign institutions eagerly went bottom fishing
while others lined up to pay premiums as high as 80% for the newly floated
American depositary rights issue of Korea Mobile Telecom, even after the firm's
shares declined by more than 16% over three successive trading days in Seoul,
hitting the maximum permissible decline on each day.

<P> Such bad news was by no means limited to Korea Mobile Telecom. The kse has
been so illiquid that the Korean government has had to postpone plans to
privatize Korea Telecom, the domestic phone carrier. All the same, foreign
analysts and investors still want to accentuate the positive about Korea.

<P> "Korea's problem is that its products are no longer the cheapest but they are
not yet at the top end, so Korean firms have to compete in the middle where
competition is the toughest," says Ed Merner, a Tokyo-based senior executive of
fund-management firm Atlantis. "The fact is that in the end you can count on
Korea to get things right," says Merner, who has managed several Korean funds in
the past. "If you bought Korean stocks in the early 1980s, in the deep recession
that followed the assassination of president Park Chung Hee, you'd be doing very
well now. There'll be some rough ups and downs, but you have to know how to ride
the waves if you want to do well in the Korean market."

<P> <B>Led by electronics</B>

<P> It is this kind of optimism that has been driving foreign investors toward
purchasing shares in Korean telecommunications manufacturers, non-life insurers
and banks, as well looking for bargains in the depressed semiconductor industry.

<P> Suh Sung-won, electronics analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's Seoul office,
is among the most optimistic observers of the Korean market today: "Although the
economy is experiencing a slowdown, the government is committed to spending w45
trillion over the next 20 years on the Korea Information Infrastructure Project."
Suh adds that more than $12 billion of the total $55 billion has been set aside
for a fibre-optic cable network to link every town and village in South Korea in
faithful imitation of us vice-president Al Gore's information superhighway
concept. An immediate beneficiary of this announcement has been Sungmi Telecom,
Korea's largest manufacturer of fibre-optic transmission equipment. In contrast
to the general collapse of share prices in the rest of the Korean electronics
industry, Sungmi's shares climbed from w70,000 earlier this year to a peak of
w220,000 won earlier this summer. In mid-August Sungmi shares were changing hands
at w189,000. lg Information and Telecommunications is another firm expected to
benefit from the Korean telecoms boom. Counting the effect of a 10% bonus issue,
lg's shares have almost doubled in six months at a time when the Kospi index as a
whole slipped to 780 from a high of 980. One indication that the Korean
government is committed to keeping up with the rest of the world in telecoms was
its sudden decision earlier this year to grant licences to 27 telecoms carriers.

<P> Analyst Suh is upbeat even about Samsung Electronics. The company raked in a
record $3.1 billion in profits last year, thanks to high demand for dram computer
memory chips. All that changed when Samsung reported profits of $558 million for
the first six months of 1996. Given the decline in dram prices, some analysts
have begun to worry whether Samsung may actually break even next year. Samsung's
shares plunged from a high of w111,000 on April 25 to w65,100 on May 30 &#173; a
41.3% loss. Although a senior Samsung executive told <I>Euromoney</I> in July
that the firm has developed alliances with Intel and Motorola to diversify into
high-value-added non-memory chips, Suh is recommending Samsung because of the
company's position as the undisputed world leader in drams. "The secret of
survival in the dram market is to keep on investing in bad times," says Suh.
"Samsung can afford to do so while its Japanese and Taiwanese competitors are
showing signs of pulling back." There is an added incentive for those foreign
investors with nerve to buy on weakness: for the first time in years, foreigners
can purchase Samsung Electronics shares without having to pay a premium.

<P> Analysts also expect non-life insurers, such as Dongyang, Dongbu, Samsung and
Hyundai, to increase profitability in the second half of this year. This is
because government-mandated motor insurance premiums are being raised. The
government also provided some good news this year for Korea's otherwise weak
banking sector by lowering the reserve requirement ratio for bad loans from 9.4%
to 7.4%. Although an analyst at a branch of a foreign securities company in Seoul
called the move "a cynical book-keeping measure aimed at improving the declining
profitability of Korean companies as a whole", lowering the reserve requirement
raised the average loan spread of the country's seven major commercial banks to
3.69% for the first six months of 1996. The government has also made it clear it
would encourage mergers in the banking sector in preparation for the increased
competition from foreign banks that are expected to move into Korea once Seoul's
entry into the oecd is approved.

<P> In a recent report, analysts at Coryo Securities list Kookmin Bank, Korea
Exchange Bank (keb) and three provincial banks &#173; Pusan, Daegu and Kyungki
&#173; as likely players in merger and acquisition scenarios. It is widely
believed that Kookmin and keb are complementary institutions: the former, once
designated by the government to handle small company loans, has an extensive
domestic network, while keb, a specialist in foreign exchange, has overseas
experience but a less developed domestic base. The provincial banks are seen as
potential providers of branches for Seoul-based commercial banks. Indeed, in the
first six months of 1996, of the six most popular stocks among foreigners, five
have been bank issues.

<P> But the reason for the flurry of foreign buying in the banking sector is not
so much desirability as availability. Earlier this year, among more than 700
stocks on the kse, only 88 had reached the 18% ceiling put on foreign investment.
This is because listed companies are capitalized at low levels, making them
unattractive for purchases by large foreign institutional investors. Worse still,
as the Daesung caper indicates, lack of transparency and poor supervision make
the majority of small-cap stocks a dangerous place for foreigners to tread. In
late July, for example, the weekly stock market report in the<I> Korea Herald</I>
pointed to "news of possible investigation of stock price manipulation of small-
and medium-cap stocks that had shown a rapid rise recently" as a reason for a
decline in stock prices. It is interesting to note that once the government made
clear that there would be no investigation, share prices recovered, at least
temporarily.

<P> But the Daesung caper is more than just a minor blemish on the reputation of
an otherwise active market. As indicated by kse figures, in terms of turnover the
Seoul market ranks ninth in the world at $185 billion per year. But given the low
level of market capitalization and the large number of small- and mid-cap issues,
what these figures seem to indicate is that this high turnover is achieved
through frequent trades, often aimed at speculative short-term gains. In other
words, in spite of the highly publicized elimination of false-name transactions
&#173; by president Kim Young Sam in August 1993, a move that did much to drive
undeclared grey funds managed by wealthy individual investors from the stock
market &#173; the kse has yet to rid itself completely of its past reputation as
a speculation-driven market where anything goes.

<P> At the moment, however, it would appear that the kse's imperfections
accurately reflect the business standards of a large number of Korean companies.
Earlier this year, Yu Han-soo, president of the prestigious posco Research
Institute, raised serious questions about the accuracy of corporate reporting in
Korea. Writing in the <I>Seoul Economic Daily</I>, Yu recalled that after the
introduction of real-name financial transactions in 1993, the press began to
report a sudden increase in gold imports; this was interpreted as meaning that
underground funds had at long last surfaced and begun to move into other areas of
business activity in Korea. It turned out that the gold imports were part of a
ruse engineered by Korean trading companies to artificially inflate their trading
volumes. Once the companies had succeeded in driving up their trade volume they
resold the gold abroad. Yu also pointed to the same practice among department
stores, which "just before the end of each year artificially inflate their sales
by using the credit cards of store employees. Once the sales are recorded, the
charges are cancelled". According to Yu, the same is true on the kse where
securities firms regularly inflate the volume of transactions by selling and then
buying back shares in their custody. Yu concludes: "For these reasons, data on
the volume of securities transactions are generally unreliable."

<P> Korea's biggest scandal of this year has been the trial of former presidents
Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo in connection with maintaining huge slush funds,
obtained through shakedowns of Korea's powerful business conglomerates, the
<I>chaebol</I>. One fallout from this has been a focusing of public attention on
the accounting practices of Korea's listed corporations.

<P> It turned out that contributions, such as Samsung's $33 million into the
coffers of ex-president Roh, did not appear on any corporate balance sheets
&#173; at least none presented to shareholders. Roh admitted taking several
hundred millions in unreported contributions from Korean companies. kse chairman
Hong Inkie has pointed to the "crippling political scandals involving two former
presidents' secret funds" as one of the major reasons for the bearish mood of the
Korean stock market since last year.

<P> <B>Towards transparency</B>

<P> The kse under Hong is considering taking action to assure a greater degree of
transparency for individual investors. An aide to Hong told <I>Euromoney</I>
recently: "If you have holdings of 3% in a company you will have the right to
demand to see the books." But, given the relatively tight cross-holdings of
<I>chaebol</I> companies and the tiny portions of individually held shares, one
wonders just how far such a 3% rule will go to further the cause of transparency
in corporate reporting.

<P> In July the ministry of finance and economy (mofe) did make an attempt to
respond to popular indignation over financial hanky-panky. The mofe unveiled what
officials called the "Korean Big Bang", a package of reforms aimed at
guaranteeing a higher quality of ipo issues. The move was in response to the most
recent scandal to hit the kse, the arrest on June 2 of Paik Won-ku, chairman of
the Securities Supervisory Board, for receiving bribes from corporations wishing
to have their shares listed on the kse.

<P> But the view of at least one commentator in Seoul is that while the mofe will
have decreased the arbitrariness of the ipo process that allowed Paik to accept
bribes, the new rules for listing have been tightened to such a degree that of
the 200 companies waiting to be listed some two-thirds will no longer qualify. In
other words, what mofe gave with one hand, it took away with the other.

<P> It is too early to gauge investor response to this Big Bang. mofe's decision
to combine the unveiling of the reforms in ipo regulations with an announcement
of measures aimed at placating oecd negotiators resulted in a sudden drop of 2.6%
in the Kospi. Among the measures announced together with the Big Bang was a
pledge to suspend use of the Stock Market Stabilization Fund, a pool of capital
the government delved into in the past to prevent prices from dropping too low.
The incident illustrates a special cultural feature of the Korean market, in that
individual investors, who account for 40% of stock ownership, continue to exhibit
a strong faith in government action to help prop up the market in bad times.

<P> <B>Moral force of officialdom</B>

<P> Among many reasons for the persistence of this attitude are: the
traditionally strong role of government officials in Korea; the fact that the
recent dramatic growth of the kse has been the result of government guidance; and
the traditional belief that officials should exert a moral force to ensure
fairness in the market. These differences in expectations between Korean
individual and international institutional investors came to a head two years ago
when prices of Korean blue-chips, such as Samsung Fire and Marine, Samsung
Electronics and Korea Mobile Telecom, soared, while small- and mid-cap shares,
the preferred investment instruments of local individuals, languished.

<P> At that time the government actively intervened to help small individual
shareholders, creating a spate of new regulations by fiat which made purchases of
large-caps expensive and inconvenient. Although the attempt to appease local
investors backfired, because foreign institutions temporarily became net sellers,
it remains to be seen whether Korean officials will be able to resist local
pressure to intervene in the market. One question being asked is why the Stock
Market Stabilization Fund is being suspended &#173; as Korea is waiting for a
response from the oecd on its membership &#173; and not totally disbanded, as
might be expected if the mofe were truly serious about turning over a new leaf.

<P> For the most part, however, watchers of Korea's stock market are putting the
blame for the present downturn less on Korea's regulatory environment than on the
crisis facing the economy as a whole. "The most important indicator for how the
stock market does is the current account balance," the kse's Hong told
<I>Euromoney</I> in a recent interview. Hong said the kse commissioned a study in
which it found a 0.88 positive correlation between movements in the current
account balance and the Kospi: "That's almost as good as one to one." Put simply,
this means if Korea's exports rise, so does its stock market. In the case of the
Samsung <I>chaebol</I> alone, profits from Samsung Electronics' dram exports
accounted for more than 80% of profits for the group as a whole.

<P> Earlier this year, however, the performance of <I>chaebol</I> exports &#173;
which as recently as 1994 accounted for 57% of Korea's total exports &#173; began
to show serious signs of deterioration. In May and June of this year, Daewoo
Motors, which recorded a 150% increase in exports in 1995, was unable to meet
monthly targets<B>.</B> Orders and prices were declining from all corners, in
semiconductors, automobiles and ships. To compound the difficulties of Korea's
cyclically vulnerable industries, the Japanese yen, which had soared high enough
in early 1995 to cripple many of Korea's Japanese competitors in overseas
markets, suddenly declined by 25% against the us dollar. The change in currency
values greatly restored the competitive edge of Japanese exporters.

<P> But the low yen was not Korea's only problem. The majority of Korean business
leaders appear to think that the deterioration in the competitive abilities of
Korea's industries goes much deeper. Of 1,000 corporate executives surveyed by
the Korean International Trade Association, 38% said the quality of Korean
products falls below that of the competition, some 61% said they are dependent on
foreign technology and an equivalent proportion said that they had made no
provisions for after-service of their export products. In this present recession
it has become clear that Korean companies lag behind their Japanese competitors
in two key areas: r&amp;d expenditure and labour-management relations. As a
proportion of outlays, South Korean firms spend less than half of what their
Japanese competitors do on r&amp;d.

<P> As for labour, in spite of average annual wage increases of 15% since 1990,
South Korean workers staged walk-outs at major motor and auto-parts manufacturers
this year. Korea's contentious labour climate has been seen as the main reason
for the mass migration overseas of major Korean corporations. Daewoo, for
example, has recently invested in car plants in Poland and India; and Kia,
another car maker, has pledged to sink $1 billion into a car plant outside
Moscow. But the problem is not simply a matter of labour cost. As far back as two
years ago, when Korea's three export jewels &#173; cars, ships and semiconductors
&#173; were still glowing brightly, a team of reporters from <I>Weekly
Choson</I>, a magazine published by Korea's largest newspaper, pointed out that
Korean car makers were 15 years behind their Japanese competitors in technology;
that a Korean car worker produced less than half the number of cars per year that
a Japanese worker does; that Japanese shipyards produced the same kind of ships
as Korean yards in less than two-thirds of the time; and that Korean
semiconductor makers faced trouble ahead because they failed to make investments
in non-memory chips.

<P> The consensus among analysts monitoring Korean industries is that the kse
will recover only when Korean industry has addressed issues of quality, labour
and efficiency. To add to the difficulties of Korean industry, bank interest has
risen. Korean corporations are heavily leveraged and as a result are
capital-hungry, even in bad times. The rise in corporate bond rates from about
10% to more than 12% in the past six months has also exacerbated the kse's
liquidity problems as investors transfer their money from a risky market into
safe bank deposits.

<P> But for those who want to accentuate the positive, there are at least three
factors which could help propel the Kospi upwards, albeit for technical reasons.
First, a double taxation agreement is expected to be signed between Japan and
Korea later this year. This will make it possible for Japanese investors to
participate in the Korean market far more easily than before. Given the
unimpressive performance of Japanese stock markets in recent years, a fair number
of Japanese investors can be expected to diversify into Korea. More funds can
also be expected from other overseas sources as the kse will raise its ceiling on
foreign participation by 2% later this year and then by 3% per year from 1997 to
1999, finally eliminating the quota altogether in 2000.

<P> Every time the ceiling has been raised so far, foreign funds have poured in
by the billion &#173; in both good times and bad.<B>&#173; <I>AH</I></B>

<H3> KOREA </H3>


<H2> <B>Living the sham of a free market</B> </H2> 

<a href="em.96.09.17b.html"> Share hunger that feeds on scandal </b></a>

<H4> <B>Korea has been
negotiating to join the OECD. But the country's financial structure is still
partly shackled, despite reforms in recent years. And president Kim's call for
Korea to accept globalization has not been welcomed by many of his compatriots
involved in finance and business. They believe opening the country's fragile
financial markets to foreigners too quickly will create instability. Andrew
Horvat reports </B> </H4> 

<P> This summer, while oecd officials considered
Korea's application for entry into the Paris-based organization of advanced
free-market economies, huge gaps began to emerge between Korean promises of open
financial markets and actual policy. Perhaps nothing highlighted this discrepancy
more clearly than the rude welcome home that awaited the record number of Korean
tourists travelling overseas this year. Even as mandarins at Korea's ministry of
finance and economy  (mofe) were busy drafting assurances to the oecd that Korea
was committed to unrestricted capital flows, prosecutors in Seoul were engaging
in a highly publicized crackdown on Korean tourists who had dared to put more
than $5,000 on their credit cards in purchases overseas.

<P> The prosecutors made no secret of having requisitioned confidential credit
card records of hundreds of thousands of Korean travellers in order to bring to
justice some 15,000 culprits. These may face up to five years in jail for having
helped push the country's balance of payments into the red this year, adding
perhaps a few million dollars to the deficit.

<P> Korea's balance of payments deficit had surpassed $9 billion by July 29,
greater than the total for all of 1995, and the campaign against spendthrift
tourists was clearly intended to intimidate travellers from taking any more money
out of the country.

<P> To make matters more interesting, the campaign came just two months after the
government had unveiled one of many deregulation packages in the financial sector
aimed at giving a favourable impression to oecd officials considering Korea's
application. That package, announced in May, raised the amount South Korean
tourists could take abroad in cash from w3 million ($3,800) to <BR> w8 million.
The government apparently did not count on a record number of Koreans going
overseas to purchase clothing and household appliances. Because of a highly
regulated Korean economy, these are cheaper in neighbouring Japan than in
department stores in Seoul. Hence the rush for bargains in Japan &#173; not
exactly a shoppers' paradise for Americans or eu residents &#173; and hence the
sudden crackdown on those who violated spending limits.

<P> Such inconsistency in stated goals and actual practice was evident almost
everywhere in Korea's financial markets on the eve of the oecd decision &#173;
and could be seen even in the promises mofe negotiators were handing to their
oecd counterparts. For example, although Korea had pledged to open the
fund-management market, it turned out that there were huge hurdles for new
entrants. Moreover, a "market need" clause would make it possible for Korean
officials to turn down any application which, in their view, might lead to
disorder in the marketplace.

<P> Likewise, a pledge to open the blue-chip bond market was conditional on the
difference between domestic and foreign interest rates narrowing to 2% &#173; and
interest rates are more or less set by the Korean government. Korean officials
would not be pinned down as to when that interest rate differential might be
reached.

<P> But deep down the argument between Paris and Seoul was about far more than
just corporate bonds. It was about how far the government of president Kim Young
Sam would be willing to go in its campaign to bring about what Kim has called
<I>segyehwa</I>, or globalization. Successful entry into the oecd was both the
symbol and the substance of a highly publicized programme that has sought to
bring Korean economic behaviour more in line with that accepted in advanced
industrialized nations. This is no mean feat in a country that has an unenviable
reputation for closed financial markets, non-transparent regulations, meddlesome
bureaucrats, and a generally xenophobic climate.

<P> To make matters more difficult for Kim and his internationalist advisers,
negotiations on oecd entry focused primarily on Korea's financial sector which,
in contrast to the thriving steel, auto and shipbuilding industries, has lagged
far behind foreign competitors in efficiency and profitability.

<P> But that is not to say that financial liberalization would have no impact on
industries in which Korea enjoys a competitive advantage. Removing barriers to
cross-border capital flows would limit the ability of Korean bureaucrats to
influence the won/dollar exchange rate, thus forcing Korean manufacturers to make
products that compete not just on price but also on quality, technology and
service.

<P> By last month progress had at least been made in obtaining firm assurances on
a full opening of the Korean securities market by  2000, and some adjustment of
Korean and oecd views had been achieved in negotiations on labour. But in key
areas, such as the domestic debt market, serious questions remained. The fact
that oecd officials were far from satisfied with Korean assurances was evident
from a remark by an official to a Seoul-based correspondent to the effect that
"political considerations" would be taken into account when passing judgment on
the Korean oecd entry bid.

<P> <B>A challenge to idealism</B>

<P> Moreover, the decision in July of oecd officials not to engage in a third
round of negotiations with their Korean counterparts, but to request responses in
writing from the mofe to questions, clearly indicated that the oecd was no longer
interested in talking. oecd officials wanted to have pledges in writing from the
Koreans on how far they were willing to go back on 30 years of protected
financial markets in order to gain entry.

<P> It is hard to imagine any application to the oecd for membership, posing more
of a challenge to the organization's free-trade ideals than Korea's. Its
commitment to free markets is probably one of the most questionable in recent
history. Its economic miracle in the late 1960s and early 1970s was created
through state-directed allocation of meagre financial resources &#173; a process
one World Bank report later characterized as "financial repression". In other
words, commercial banks were nationalized and turned into cogs in the machinery
of what amounted to a command economy.

<P> As for its foreign exchange market, Korea was identified by the us as a
"foreign currency manipulator" on three occasions (October 1988, April 1989 and
October 1989). Shortly after that us-Korea tiff, the value of the won
mysteriously rose by some 25% against the dollar, and Korea's only years of trade
surpluses became but a memory.

<P> As recently as two years ago, the Swiss-based International Institute for
Management Development found Korea's financial services to be the least free
among the 13 Asia-Pacific countries and territories it rated. South Korea's
markets ranked at the bottom in seven of 10 categories ranging from "level of
market sophistication" to "appropriateness of legal regulation of financial
institutions".

<P> On the other hand, Korea has been swept up by the globalization campaign in
recent years. At the forefront of the mass movement to harmonize Korean economic
practices with those accepted in the advanced industrialized world is none other
than president Kim, who as early as 1992 put oecd entry on his election platform.
A month after becoming Korea's first civilian president in 35 years in March
1993, he outlined his vision for a new Korean economy. The cornerstone of the
domestic part of what was dubbed the New Economy package was the elimination of
unnecessary regulations and the reining in of the arbitrary powers of
bureaucrats. Membership of the oecd, an organization committed to the free
market, would be a fitting complement to Kim's vision.

<P> Even though Korea clearly lags behind other countries in the openness of its
capital markets, Kim and his advisers have at least opened a few doors in the
past two years. For example, the limit on foreign ownership of Korean stocks has
steadily been raised from an initial 10% in 1992 to 18% as of August this year.
mofe officials have promised to eliminate the ceiling on foreign equity ownership
altogether by 2000.

<P> <B>Naming names</B>

<P> Perhaps Kim's most dramatic effort to eliminate arbitrary non-transparent
market behaviour came on August 13 1993 when he issued a declaration abolishing
"false name" financial transactions. Hitherto, the government had looked the
other way while thousands of wealthy corporations and individuals (often corrupt
politicians and officials) put their undeclared funds into the stock market and
into the semi-legal high-interest loan market based in Myongdong, Seoul's
entertainment district. The flow of illicit funds into these two markets had been
the result of distortions caused by over-regulation: as, for example, in the case
of the huge bribes that bank presidents in Korea regularly accept in order to
bend government regulations limiting the allocation of loans.

<P> Kim's introduction of a "real name" financial system has largely been a
success. Although the stock market initially plunged, after undeclared funds
invested in false name accounts suddenly left the market, within a few weeks the
index recovered as ordinary individuals realized the potential benefits of more
transparent practices.

<P> Later that same year Kim unveiled his <I>segyehwa</I> campaign. In short, he
urged Koreans to wave goodbye to economic nationalism and say hello to the fact
that Korea needs the world more than the world needs Korea. <I>Segyehwa</I>
countered the fact that while economic nationalism may have helped Korea pull
itself up by its bootstraps, the xenophobia it fostered also discouraged foreign
investment.

<P> Moreover, as government officials explained, an absence of foreign investment
meant an absence of technology transfers. Korean labour costs were rising (thanks
in part to the return of the military to their barracks), and the country had
high interest rates (thanks in part to the huge volume of non-performing loans
banks had been saddled with during the days of financial repression). So Korea
had no choice but to open its doors to foreign investment and foreign technology,
without which Korean products would be unable to compete successfully in overseas
markets.

<P> It was because of <I>segyehwa</I> that government officials, such as Ha
Dong-man, a division director in the former Economic Planning Board, could alert
Koreans to the effect that restrictive policies and a hostile domestic climate
had on foreign investment in Korea: it amounted to a mere $5.5 billion between
1988 and 1992, compared with inflows into China, Malaysia and Thailand which in
the same five-year period had totalled $87.6 billion, $24.7 billion and $30.4
billion respectively.

<P> But just in case the importance of <I>segyehwa</I> was missed by the general
public, the government for the first time took steps to make ordinary Koreans
aware of the strongly critical feelings of foreign business people about working
in Korea.

<P> One example was a government-commissioned survey, the results of which became
the lead front-page story of the <I>Choson Ilbo</I>, South Korea's largest daily.
Of the 349 American, Australian and European resident business representatives
surveyed, 47.1% singled out "various government regulations applied to business"
as the most trying aspect of working in Korea. The next largest group rated
xenophobia, both in business and in ordinary life, the biggest hurdle. Perhaps
not surprisingly, the survey quoted a majority of respondents as requesting
president Kim to genuinely internationalize the Korean economy.

<P> Though the survey might smack of a government campaign, <I>segyehwa</I> has
served the interests of international business and finance far better than
previous government campaigns, which had urged Koreans to stop smoking foreign
cigarettes, refrain from spending lavishly on weddings, and generally lead frugal
lives. Invariably frugality meant staying away from "foreign luxuries". One form
of quasi-legal discouragement consisted of sudden tax audits of anyone with a
taste for foreign cars. This resulted in wealthy Koreans removing the numerical
designation badges from their Mercedes-Benz cars, or else having the numbers
modified downward so that a Mercedes 600 series would be disguised as a Mercedes
320.

<P> <B>A cap on xenophobia</B>

<P> <I>Segyehwa</I> also put an end to spontaneous outbursts of anti-foreign
activity. For example, when us film distributors attempted to import Hollywood
films in the late 1980s for the first time, Koreans opposed to foreign
participation in the film market released snakes in crowded cinemas. Likewise,
managers of Control Data, an American electronics manufacturer, were forcibly
held by Korean employees until they gave in to wage demands. Control Data was
among a number of foreign companies that closed their factories in Korea, never
to return. Since the government's <I>segyehwa</I> campaign, no such anti-foreign
outbursts have been reported.

<P> Seen in this light, president Kim has been nothing less than an
internationalist. Indeed, at least one official has argued that for the oecd to
refuse to accept Korea as a member now would be to humiliate Kim and to turn the
clock back to an unpleasant past.

<P> On the other hand, there has been plenty of room to raise serious questions.
Korea's suddenly deteriorating balance of payments had clearly made Korean
policymakers at all levels more cautious about free capital flows. As Song Hee
Young, business editor of the <I>Choson Ilbo</I>, puts it: "Koreans see entry
into the oecd as evidence of having gained advanced-country status. The problem
is that right now we are headed into a recession. So some people want to slow the
entry process down."

<P> If evidence was needed for this change of heart among the Korean elite, there
is plenty of it in the form of imaginative doomsday scenarios linked to Korea's
oecd entry. For example, if Korea were to accede to the wishes of the oecd and
fully open its financial markets, the sudden influx of foreign funds would be so
great as to trigger a financial crisis of the magnitude that shook Mexico in
December 1994.

<P> As Shim Sang Dal, mofe's chief spokesman puts it: "There are people in Korea
who see Mexico as an example of what can happen to a country when money is
allowed to enter and leave quickly. If the fundamentals of the economy are not
sound, the process weakens competitiveness." (This refers to short-term portfolio
investment &#173; South Korea has a 30% plus savings rate, and most overseas
borrowings are long-term bank loans.)

<P> For those afraid of a confrontation with North Korea, if the South Korean
government were to accede to the liberalization demands of oecd negotiators, it
would be surrendering important fiscal tools necessary in the event of a national
emergency. It is argued that foreigners, unlike patriotic Koreans, will not
hesitate to pull their money out of Korea quickly should communist North Korea
threaten national security in the future. As mofe spokesman Shim puts it: "The
government has been cautious for both fiscal and geopolitical reasons."

<P> Finally, there is the Japanese version of doomsday. This envisages the inflow
of foreign funds precipitated by the opening of Korean financial markets leading
to a high won, which would then usher in years of spiralling domestic land and
stock prices. And, like the Japanese bubble, the Korean version would soon burst,
leaving the economy in a shambles.

<P> The doomsday scenarios all have something in common. They focus on the
single-most serious gap in thinking between the oecd and Seoul, one that is
likely to remain unresolved for years, regardless of which way the oecd votes.
The bone of contention is the blue-chip bond market.

<P> Paralleling the bond market, and equally significant for foreign financial
institutions, is the present ban on foreign borrowing by Korean corporations.
Since the late 1980s these have been barred from borrowing abroad (except when
engaged in overseas projects) and Korean banks must obtain official permission
before obtaining a loan from a foreign bank. This is in spite of the fact that
Korea's industrialization was achieved through direct foreign bank loans, which
at one time reached almost $50 billion,

<P> The reason for such a cautious approach to investment comes from the fear
that huge and sudden inflows of foreign capital will result in a rise in the
value of the won and that exchange rate instability will destroy Korea's export
competitiveness.

<P> <B>Bond warnings</B>

<P> Perhaps the most eloquent spokesman for Korea's cautious approach to opening
the bond market is Cho Yoon Je, a former World Bank and imf economist, at present
a senior fellow at the Korea Institute of Public Finance. To begin with, Cho
stresses that Korean corporate bonds are guaranteed: "If you allow risk-free
Korean bonds to be bought by foreigners, you are giving them an opportunity to
make arbitrage windfalls."

<P> As of early August the yield on blue-chip corporate bonds stood at 12.36%.
Corporate bond yields have been rising because of a 37% decline in the profits of
Korea's listed companies &#173; a 55% decline in the key manufacturing sector.
Korean corporations are heavily leveraged and need to borrow in both good times
and bad. (In this same period, the us treasury bill rate stood at just above 5%.)

<P> A peculiarity of the Korean corporate bond market is that some bonds are
issued with stamped bank guarantees. Recently, when a Korean construction firm
was on the brink of bankruptcy, it was the shares of its main bank, not the
firm's own shares, that took a beating on the stock market. If the construction
firm were to become insolvent, the bank would have had to reimburse the firm's
bondholders. Cho stresses that if, as the oecd has apparently insisted, South
Korea fully liberalizes its bond market, investors from all over the world will
make a mad rush for such corporate blue-chip bonds.

<P> "There are many things the government can do," says Cho. "If they do nothing,
the sudden inflow will increase the money supply, which then will result in
inflation. In response the Bank of Korea can buy up the domestic liquidity by
issuing stabilization bonds."

<P> But Cho argues that such constant mopping up of funds would result in a
vicious circle in which domestic interest rates would continue to increase and
foreign funds would just keep on coming in.

<P> "Already about w30 trillion worth of stabilization bonds have been issued,"
says Cho. This amount is more than the total monetary base of the country (cash
in hand plus deposits from Korean banks and banking institutions at the Bank of
Korea.)

<P> The government does have another option, according to Cho. To help control
inflationary pressures, it could opt for strong fiscal restraint, but public
investment is badly needed. "The government cannot stop spending now because the
country is facing severe social infrastructure bottlenecks," says Cho. He points
to the Seoul&#173;Pusan freeway on which it used to be possible to travel between
the country's two main centres in six hours: "That trip now takes 10 hours."

<P> Korea's harbours are also inadequate, leading to increased costs of exports
because of the long waiting time for ships to be loaded and unloaded. There is
little room to make cuts, so Cho advocates "gradualism in the opening of the debt
market".

<P> <B>Crumbs from the table</B>

<P> In August, it was difficult to know if oecd negotiators would be swayed by
arguments such as those offered by Cho, one of a number of economists who have
close connections with Korean officials negotiating with the oecd. One thing is
certain: in Seoul representatives of foreign securities houses were less than
amused by what they saw as "crumbs" being thrown to them in a recent series of
measures ostensibly designed to open financial markets to them.

<P> In the corporate bond market, for example, mofe officials have pledged to
raise the ceiling on unsecured and non-guaranteed corporate bonds issued by small
and medium-sized Korean firms from 30% to 50%. This part of the bond market is
high in risk and low in liquidity, and hence not very popular with investors of
any nationality.

<P> In Seoul, where government regulation of both domestic and foreign financial
houses is all-pervasive, it is difficult to find many financial market players
willing to go on record criticizing the policies of mofe officials. Nonetheless,
there is no shortage of privately voiced dissatisfaction over one particular
market-opening package aimed clearly at satisfying formal criteria for oecd
membership. In November 1995 mofe announced a plan to open the money management
field to foreign companies. In the view of one foreign securities analyst,
however, the package was "an opening in name only". Eligibility requirements for
100% foreign-owned investment management businesses included "assets under
management totalling the equivalent of $18 billion".

<P> Questioned as to why such huge qualifying requirements were to be imposed
solely on  foreign firms, mofe spokesman Shim replied: "That is to insure that
only companies with good financial standing will come."

<P> But the foreign analyst also points to the requirement that foreign fund
management companies spend $6 million in operating expenses &#173; yet another
hurdle set up to discourage foreign financial houses from setting up shop in
Seoul.

<P> "The purpose of the package is to help foreign fund managers come to the
conclusion that it is cheaper to make a few visits a year to Seoul than to stay
around," says the analyst. This same package also called for a "needs test": the
criterion for which would not be disclosed, but it would be administered by mofe
officials. Apparently as a result of foreign pressure, the government dropped the
words "needs test" and promised a new criterion to be announced later.

<P> If the sticking points in the negotiations with the oecd have tended to focus
on finance, it is because the financial sector is without a doubt the most
underdeveloped part of Korea's economy, and one that suffers most from the
crippling legacy of past industrial policy.

<P> Even though Korea today has an economy that is the 12th largest in the world,
is the world's 13th-largest trading nation, has the world's fifth-largest car
industry and the largest backlog in shipbuilding orders, it does not have a
single bank which is rated among the top 100 in the world.

<P> A World Bank discussion paper published just last year points to other
weaknesses in the financial sector. It states that in the long period when Korean
banks were under government control "their managerial efficiency and the quality
of their services were sacrificed".

<P> <B>Black market skills base</B>

<P> Karl Moskowitz, a Seoul-based management consultant, has drawn attention to
the fact that in its heyday Myongdong's black market in money was considerably
more advanced in credit-rating skills than Korea's commercial banks: "It is the
only debt market in Korea where credit decisions and risk premiums are based on
creditworthiness and the likelihood of repayment, not on fixed-asset collateral
or guarantees &#173; a skill the commercial banks have yet to display."

<P> Moskowitz praises the resourcefulness of the private credit bureaux in
Myongdong, whose staff "obtain information from the records of commercial banks,
tax offices, and similar confidential sources through informal methods".

<P> In contrast, South Korea's major banks are classic cases of overemployment
and inefficiency. Moreover, South Korean labour practices make it extremely
difficult to dismiss surplus employees, and so mergers cannot be counted on to
bring about increased efficiency.

<P> To make matters worse, rivalry between the government and Korea's huge
business conglomerates, the <I>chaebol</I>, has resulted in the passing of
legislation aimed at preventing any Korean bank from being taken over by a
<I>chaebol</I>.

<P> There may be understandable social reasons for a bank being prevented from
falling into the hands of a large capital-hungry conglomerate. But the result is
that once Korea has truly been integrated into the oecd, relatively weak Korean
banks &#173; whose average efficiency has been rated at roughly half the level of
the typical Swiss bank &#173; will have to be able to fend for themselves in an
increasingly sophisticated and highly competitive open environment.

<P> The fact that mofe negotiators have made no attempts to protect the banks
from the foreign competition that is likely to arise might just indicate that
somewhere in the bowels of the mofe building there are Korean officials who
really would like to see a part of their country's financial industry gain
strength through open competition.

A deceleration, evident since the last quarter of 1995, has begunlater than in the other main European countries and growth is expected toremain subdued. The slowdown of economic activity is due to the slackeningof import demand of Italy's main trading partners. On the whole in 1996,GDP growth is projected to be 1.8%. After rapidly accelerating from thefirst quarter of 1995, inflation returned to a downward path from the startof 1996. In March, it dropped to 4.5% year on year; this compares with amaximum of 6% in November 1995. Inflation is expected to fall to 3.3% bythe end of 1996. <BR><BR>Last year, despite the downward trend in interest rates in the main industrialcountries, the Bank of Italy maintained a restrictive anti-inflationarymonetary stance. In the first months of 1996, the sharp decrease in inflationand the appreciation of the lira caused short-term interbank rates to dropbelow the fixed term advances rate (10.5%). <BR><BR>In the next few months, a decline in interest rates should be made morelikely by the further reduction of inflation and the prospects of anothercut in German interest rates. The prerequisites for a cut in interest ratesappear to be the slowdown of inflation to 4% for 1996 and further progressin the budget deficit consolidation. <BR><BR><B>Yield forecasts and the shape of the yield curve</B> <BR><BR>Yields on 10-year treasury bonds (BTPs) have outperformed the decline inBunds from October to December 1995. They have fallen from a high of 13.2%in March 1995 to a minimum of 10% in January this year, and have now risento 10.5% on the back of the rise in United States and German long term interestrates. The yield spread over German 10-year bonds has sharply decreasedfrom a high of 620 basis points in April 1995, to 405 basis points one yearlater. The closing of the gap between the Italian and the German rates isexpected to continue during 1996. <BR><BR>The Italian yield curve has flattened: at the beginning of April the differencebetween a three month and a ten year yield was around 1.1%, while six monthsago it was 1.5%. The flattening of the curve (even more evident in February)is due to the perspectives already mentioned about inflation and economicgrowth and the high possibility of a cut in official rates in the next future.We expect that, toward the end of the year, the curve will steepen a little(around 1.3%) according to the scenario of lower short-term rates in thesecond part of 1996 and the possibility of a more cautious reduction inlong-term rates. <BR><BR><B>Budgetary considerations and funding pressures</B> <BR><BR>Since 1992, Italy has embarked on a virtuous path of fiscal consolidationwith effective action to improve public finance, including a thorough reformof the state pension system. In 1995, the public sector borrowing requirementhas been held down to 130 trillion lire as targetted by the 1995 FinanceBill. <BR><BR>According to the medium term plan (1996-98), the Italian government envisageda reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement from 9.5% of GDPin 1994 to 7.4% in 1995 and to 5.9% by 1996. The 3% Maastricht requirementshould be met in 1998. In absolute terms, the public sector borrowing requirementshould be cut to 109.4 trillion lire in 1996. The primary budget surplusshould rise to about 80 trillion in 1996 from 65 trillion lire in 1995,while the debt service bill should remain around 190 trillion lire. <BR><BR>According to updated projections about the state sector requirement resultsfor the first three months of 1996, a supplementary package (about 10 trillionlire) is likely to be decided to meet the 1996 deficit target. The 1996Finance Bill includes a clause which requires an automatic correction onthe side of expenditure cuts in the case that updated forecasts are higherthan those anticipated. <BR><BR>In 1996 the pressure on the bond market will be similar to that of lastyear, when the deficit was financed primarly with net issues of BTPs andto a minor extent with CTZs (Zero Coupon Certificates) and BOTs (OrdinaryTreasury Bills). <BR><BR>We do not expect major changes in the managing of the debt by the Treasuryin 1996: this means that the new deficit will be mainly financed by issuesin BTPs and CTZs, while we expect very small &shyp; if not negative &shyp;net issues in CCTs (Treasury Credit Notes) and BOTs. <BR><BR><B>Market history and structure</B> <BR><BR>Important changes have characterized the managing of public debt by theTreasury since the beginning of the 1980s. That period was characterizedby the predominance of short-term bonds, while the medium- and long-termbonds were largely made up of variable rate CCTs. Beginning in 1983, investors'interest in CCTs made it possible to cut down the proportion of BOTs issuedand thereby extend the average maturity of the debt. In 1986, medium-termfixed-rate issues again assumed an important role with the introductionof BTPs. This tendency continued through the following years, and culminatedin 1993 with the 30-year BTP issue, which signified an increase in the averagematurity of the debt (at present 3 years and 3 months, compared to 2 yearsand 10 months in June 1993). <BR><BR>Since the late 1980s, treasury policy has been characterized by the introductionof market criteria into government security management. The most importantactions have been the adoption of an auction system through which the marketdetermines prices; the creation of the Secondary Telematic Market (MTS)for government bonds; and the care taken to ensure sufficient liquidityfor bonds in the MTS via the provision of adequate volumes of bonds foreach individual issue. <BR><BR><B>Bond auctions</B> <BR><BR>Traditionally, government bond options were based upon the system of sealedenvelopes. Now, a computerized method is used. The market subsequently benefitsfrom shorter auction times and more rapid diffusion of the results. <BR><BR>Italian government bonds can take varying forms: <BR><BR>BOTs (Ordinary Treasury Bills) are short-term bonds initially introducedto compensate temporary Treasury imbalances and have become one of the mostpopular forms of family savings. The bonds are zero-coupon with maturityranging from three to six and twelve months, expressed in days. They areissued fortnightly, through competitive price auctions and without a baseprice indicator. Requests (ranked by bid prices) must be in hundredths ofa percentage point for 3 and 6 month bills and in five hundredths for one-yearbills and are met at the bidding price until all bills on offer are allocated.If there are many requests for bills at the stop-out price, they are allocatedon a pro-rata basis. There also exixts a mechanism to prevent speculationwhich excludes bids far under market prices. <BR><BR>CTZs (Zero-coupon Treasury Credit notes) were issued in February 1995 forthe first time: their maturity is 24 months, expressed in days. They areissued fortnightly through a marginal auction, without a price indicator.Requests must be in five hundredths of a percentage point. A mechanism toexclude speculation similar to that for the BOTs is used. As the issue ofa given bond is re-opened through auctions of successive tranches, the referenceprice for taxation purposes is the price fixed for the first tranche. <BR><BR>BTPs (Medium-Long Term Treasury Bonds) are fixed-rate government bonds withsemi-annual dividend coupons. They played a limited role in financing statedeficits during the 1970s and the early 1980s, but now their net issuesfinance almost all the deficit. At present they are issued with 3, 5 and10 years maturities. The characteristics of the auctions (that take placeevery beginning and mid-month) are the same as for the CTZs. The same bondis re-issued until it reaches a large flotation (usually at least 10 trillionlire). <BR><BR>CCTs (Treasury Credit Notes) are variable-rate, medium-long term bonds,with semi-annual dividend coupons (or annual for some old issues), indexedto BOT yields. They played a major role in the 1980s, but now are beingprogressively substituted with BTPs. <BR><BR>At present, they have a 7-year maturity and are issued twice a month viamarginal auctions, like the CTZs and BTPs. They, too, are re-issued untilthey reach a large flotation. The CCT indexing mechanism has changed withtime. Currently, it is as follows: the simple gross yield-at-issue of six-monthBOTs in the last auction which precedes the due date of interest is dividedby two and rounded off to the nearest five hundredth.

While the brunt of the selling has been borne by the US andsome other dollar block countries &shyp; notably Australia and New Zealand&shyp; a number of European bond markets have recovered all or most of theirinitial falls. <BR><BR>The message is that some decoupling of European and US interest rates hasbeen in progress, along with a convergence of yields within Europe itself.<BR><BR>Given its timing, the sudden break in the market in January had echoes ofthe early-1994 sell-off, prompting fears that history was about to repeatitself. But world bond markets were nowhere near as overbought as they werein early 1994. Then the average underweighted yield to maturity of the 21bond markets included in Zurich Investment Management's database was barely5.7%. <BR><BR>This January it was a full percentage point higher, yet inflation expectationswere significantly lower than they had been two years earlier. The technicalbackdrop was also markedly different. The magnitude of the price collapsein early 1994 owed much to the role played by hedge funds and other highlyleveraged investors. <BR><BR>A cheap money bubble was simply waiting to be pricked. Despite the availability,this time around, of plentiful Yen finance at 1% or less, its impact appearsto have been minor. But what most distinguishes the price action over recentmonths is the marked divergence in the performance of the main markets,in contrast to the largely uniform collapse in prices witnessed in the firstquarter of 1994, when the selling was more or less indiscriminate. <BR><BR>The worst performers have been New Zealand, the US and Australia, followedclosely by the UK. By contrast, the strongest markets have been those ofSpain, Portugal Switzerland and Italy, where, in some cases, the March/Aprilrally more than restored the losses suffered in February. As it is, theaverage rise in yields across the 21 markets is just 40 basis points &shyp;hardly the stuff of which panic sell-offs are made. <BR><BR>In the process, European yield spreads over German Bunds have narrowed significantly&shyp; an example of convergence at work for which European government ministerswould doubtless like to take some of the credit. Certainly, economic policy-makingin these markets remains firmly focused on sound Maastricht principles.<BR><BR>But the reality is that markets have simply been adjusting to equilibriumvalues &shyp; and to the quite dramatic compression in the range of inflationexpectations across Europe. On the fundamental valuation criteria employedby the ZIM bond valuation model, the premium status of Dm paper remainshard to justify. <BR><BR>The process of yield alignment in Europe has doubtless been aided by theweakness of the Deutschmark against the dollar, providing encouragementfor funds to diversify out of Bunds and into other European government bonds.So where does the value lie now? Three markets appear particularly attractive:New Zealand, the UK and Australia. <BR><BR>The UK has been the poorest performer in Europe. Its political problemshave been well chronicled but are probably discounted at current levels.Sterling does not look overvalued at present, government borrowing is ona downtrend (albeit a low one), and the long-term budgetary outlook is unclutteredby the big pensions overhang that clouds the outlook elsewhere in Europe.The bear case stresses the real possibility that UK fiscal policy couldyet be subverted by political pressures ahead of the general election. <BR><BR>But were is this to happen, we could probably count on a swift correctionfrom whichever party forms the next government. Australian and New Zealandgovernment bonds have been caught in the backwash from the US market wherethe resilience of the economy has destroyed any consensus on the likelynext move in short-term interest rates. <BR><BR>The result is that both markets now offer very high real returns. In Australia,long bonds offer yields of 9%, compared with inflation expectations of around3.5%. This is in the context of a newly elected government keen to resistthe wage push that was seen as inevitable under its predecessor. <BR><BR>In New Zealand, long-term yields, now at the same level as in Australia,contrast with inflation of just over 2%, and which the admirable Don Brash,the Reserve Bank Govenor, is intent on bringing back within a 2% ceiling.A strong currency provides added comfort. Outside these three markets, theZIM model anticipates little or no capital appreciation in world bond marketson a six-month view. By and large, markets now look fair value and no more.<BR><BR>The message is that while the first half of the 1990s has been uncommonlykind to international bond portfolios &shyp; producing double digit returnsin four of the last five years &shyp; the second half is looking a tougherproposition. The process of adjusting to a low inflation environment hasrun its course: the challenge now will be to squeeze anything from the bulkof markets. <I>Gordon Johns </I><p></td></tr></table><br><nobr><a href="em.96.05.23.index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Back a Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt1.gif" alt="Back"></a><a href="../../../../../services/faqs.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Help';return true"><img width=22 height=22 hspace=90 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt2.gif" alt="Help"></a><a href="#top" onMouseOver="window.status='Top of the Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt3.gif" alt="Top"></a></nobr><br><br><nobr><a href="../../../../../alert/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='ALERT - Discussion Groups, Latest News, Site Updates, Sponsors and Events Diary';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav1.gif" alt="Alert"></a><a href="../../../../../search/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SEARCH - Keyword and Structured Searches';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav2.gif" alt="Search"></a><a href="../../../../../services/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SERVICES - FAQs, Feedback, Problems and EMWL Team';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav3.gif" alt="Services"></a><a href="../../../../../contents/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='CONTENTS - Publications, World Map, Product Sections and Data';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav44.gif" alt="Contents"></a></nobr></font><br><br><font size=2>All material subject to strictly enforced copyright laws. 1996&copy; <a href="MAILTO:pbrady@pobox.com">Euromoney Publications PLC.</a></font><br></center></body></html>

A spread of 30bp is considered normal, due to the factthat the Austrian market is not as liquid as its German counterpart. Currentlythe spread amounts to only a few basis points. <BR><BR>International investors obviously consider Austria a natural participantin the coming European monetary union. The primary reason for this judgmentis, of course, the fact that the Austrian schilling has been pegged to theGerman mark for years, which means Austria has successfully, if unofficially,participated in the former European Monetary System. There was a significantinterest and yield premium paid by Austria when it began its hard currencypolicy in the seventies. Since that time key figures for the Austrian economyhave made impressive progress, closely matching those of Germany. <BR><BR><B>Low growth, inflation and interest rates</B> <BR><BR>Current forecasts for economic growth have again been lowered. Real GDPgrowth of 1% is expected this year, and growth of somewhat over 1% is expectednext year. In particular the domestic demand components comprising privateconsumption and investments have lost much of their dynamism; foreign demandis now the driving force behind economic growth. This situation will improvewhen there are clear signs of economic recovery in Europe (particularlyin Germany). Austria's budget consolidation program, which will reduce thefederal deficit in line with the Maastricht criteria from 5% of GDP (1995)to 3.8% (1996) and then to 2.7% (1997), will be one of the decisive factorsaffecting 1996 and 1997. The rate of inflation has declined considerably:it amounted to 2.2% in 1995 and is expected to total 2.1% this year. Yetin view of first quarter developments, it could actually fall below 2% thisyear. The inflation rate in 1997 will be less than 2% in any event. <BR><BR>The Austrian National Bank - like the German Bundesbank - has reduced keyinterest rates to the spectacularly low level of 2.5% at mid-April 1996.Recent steps taken by the Bundesbank to lower interest rates were somewhatsurprising in view of the fact that M3 is exceeding both expectations andthe central bank's target corridor. <BR><BR>Thus the Bundesbank&#180;s actions are to be viewed as measures designedto stimulate economic growth and investment. The former goal can only beachieved, however, if the bond market reacts favorably to the measures reducinginterest rates. This was attempted by leaving the repo rate in Germany unchangedat 3.3%. Due to this decision, the spread between German discount and reporates widened to 80 basis points. This means that investors still expecta further decline in the repo rate, which is an important factor for performanceon the bond market. Thus future developments on Deutschmark as well as Austrianschilling bond markets may very well be viewed positively in light of themonetary measures implemented last month. <BR><BR>The Austrian money market continues to show a high level of liquidity, whichrecently led to rates falling below Deutschmark reference rates. Money marketrates in Austria will decline further following possible repo rate cutsin Germany, but the negative differential with German rates will not necessarilyremain. Bond yields, which peaked at the beginning of March, have fluctuatedstrongly on a day-to-day basis but the trend has clearly been toward loweryields. <BR><BR>As in Germany, bond yields in Austria face a further decline on accountof the money market's continued expectation of interest rate cuts. Onlytoward the end of 1996 will this be replaced by upward movements, assumingthat the current vague expectations of economic growth become more concrete.<BR><BR><B>A solid currency</B> <BR><BR>The Austrian schilling/Deutschmark currency risk remains negligible. Regardlessof the status of Euro discussions, the Austrian National Bank will continueto pursue its present foreign exchange policy. <BR><BR>Austria's participation in Emu at the earliest possible date seems assuredin view of the government's planned fiscal measures. Given the Austrianschilling/Deutschmark linkage, the US dollar will continue to appreciaterelative to the schilling this year, before levelling out within a twelve-monthperiod. <BR><BR>The expectation that the short-term dollar/Deutschmark interest rate spreadwill again expand, is an important factor determining the development ofthe dollar. As long as this situation continues, exchange rates in Europewill be relatively stable, leaving aside any potential turbulence relatedto the Euro discussions. <BR><BR><B>A bond market of record size</B> <BR><BR>Bonds are the most important instruments on the Austrian capital market.The outstanding volume of bonds has increased dramatically during the lasttwo decades to stand at Sch1.401 trillion at the end of 1996, about 59%of estimated 1995 GDP. Central government is the largest single issuer ofbonds, with 44% of the outstanding volume. The annual gross issue volumeof central government bonds has increased steeply in recent years and reacheda peak of Sch115 billion in 1995. The Austrian Federal Financing Agencyintends to place Federal bonds totalling between Sch110 billion and Sch120billion in 1996, so that a new record is likely to be set. <BR><BR>In order to increase market liquidity, it will issue as much debt as possibleby re-opening existing issues, taking account of the redemption calendarand the permitted band of 98-102 when setting the average price.<p></td></tr></table><br><nobr><a href="em.96.05.23.index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Back a Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt1.gif" alt="Back"></a><a href="../../../../../services/faqs.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Help';return true"><img width=22 height=22 hspace=90 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt2.gif" alt="Help"></a><a href="#top" onMouseOver="window.status='Top of the Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt3.gif" alt="Top"></a></nobr><br><br><nobr><a href="../../../../../alert/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='ALERT - Discussion Groups, Latest News, Site Updates, Sponsors and Events Diary';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav1.gif" alt="Alert"></a><a href="../../../../../search/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SEARCH - Keyword and Structured Searches';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav2.gif" alt="Search"></a><a href="../../../../../services/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SERVICES - FAQs, Feedback, Problems and EMWL Team';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav3.gif" alt="Services"></a><a href="../../../../../contents/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='CONTENTS - Publications, World Map, Product Sections and Data';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav44.gif" alt="Contents"></a></nobr></font><br><br><font size=2>All material subject to strictly enforced copyright laws. 1996&copy; <a href="MAILTO:pbrady@pobox.com">Euromoney Publications PLC.</a></font><br></center></body></html>

Robust employment growth over the last quarter, together withsigns of a pick-up in the US economy, point to accelerating GDP growth overthe second half of this year and into 1997 (Chart 1). While fiscal policywill continue to act as a major drag on domestic spending, there shouldbe sufficient momentum from exports, and stimulus from monetary policy,to support 2.0% growth in real GDP this year and 3.1% in 1997. <BR><BR>Structural changes in the economy, which have held back the expansion, bodewell for the future performance of Canadian debt markets. There is a hugefiscal drag &shyp; the contractionary imact on the economy of governmentspending cuts &shyp; which we estimate will chop roughly 1.5 points thisyear from growth. But fiscal deficits are shrinking rapidly. Finance ministerMartin will continue easily to better his targets for deficit reduction&shyp; and, in the process, eliminate net federal financing requirementsby fiscal 1998/99. <BR><BR>That would mark the first time in almost three decades that the federalgovernment will not undertake net new borrowing. Provincial deficits havebeen halved over the past four years, with eight of Canada's 10 provincesexpected to post balanced budgets or small surpluses this year. What remainsof provincial deficits is now the target of aggressive deficit-cutting agendasin Ontario and Quebec. <BR><BR>The fiscal adjustment, coupled with weak domestic demand and a cheaper Canadiandollar, has in turn whittled down Canada's other chronic deficit &shyp;an historically large current account imbalance. Spearheaded by a successionof record merchandise trade surpluses, Canada's current account deficithas melted from a G7-leading 4% of GDP only three years ago to less than1% of GDP this year. Although the trade surplus faces some erosion witha healthier domestic consumer next year, fiscal drag has slowed the risein foreign debt to a crawl. Large interest outflows which have historicallyundermined Canada's balance of payments position will soon be stemmed. <BR><BR>Lastly, fiscal discipline has made a major contribution to price stability.Canada should continue to outperform the US on the inflation front, boththis year and next, with CPI inflation running anywhere from a full pointto a point and a half lower than the US. Next year will mark the sixth consecutiveyear in which Canadian inflation will remain below the US. <BR><BR><B>Market outlook</B> <BR><BR>Judged on the merits of its own fundamentals, there is a compelling caseto be made in favour of Canadian debt markets, as evidenced by the recenttightening of Canada-US spreads. However, in the near term, the Canadianfixed-income market will remain a casualty of an ongoing correction in theTreasuries market. A further sell-off at the long end of the US Treasuriescurve, with prices dropping 5%, should elevate 10-year Canada yields tothe 8.5% range. The prognosis for the Canadian fixed-income market shouldbrighten considerably next year once US long Treasury yields stabilize andultimately decline. Backed by strong domestic fundamentals, long Canadayields should drop nearly 100bp over the course of 1997 with the yield onthe 10 year benchmark falling to about 7.5%. <BR><BR>At the short end of the yield curve, latent support for the Canadian dollarhas permitted the Bank of Canada to ease independently from the FederalReserve. This has driven Canadian bill yields to levels lower than the equivalentTreasuries. We expect flat to slightly negative bill spreads to persistuntil the autumn. <BR><BR>This posture could become a liability for the Canadian dollar when US moneymarket yields rise in Fed tightening later this year. Faced with much moreeconomic slack and no inflation threat, the Bank of Canada should initiallylag behind Fed tightening, leaving the exchange rate with the US dollarvulnerable. We expect a return to the $1.39 range by year-end. However,building domestic demand should gradually sway the Bank of Canada to a tighterstance, with the Canadian dollar rallying through most of next year to $1.34once the Bank lets go of short-term rates. <BR><BR><B>How government bonds are issued</B> <BR><BR>The Government of Canada issues marketable bonds in its own name. Theseare underwritten by the primary distributors &shyp; investment dealers andCanadian chartered banks. There is now only one method of issuance: theauction system. (Prior to late 1991 the government also employed the allotmentmethod for some issues. Here, primary dealers were paid a commission todistribute bonds at a fixed price, set by the Bank of Canada.) <BR><BR>The Bank of Canada's auction mechanism is very similar to the US system.At the beginning of each calendar quarter, it announces the quarterly auctionschedule, setting out the dates of the auction, the settlement date andthe maturity terms to be auctioned. Currently there is at least one auctioneach quarter in the following terms: 2-year, 3-year, 5-year, 10-year and30-year, along with the inflation-linked Real Return Bond. <BR><BR>The auction system continues to evolve, reflecting the Bank of Canada'sannounced goal of improving the liquidity of the domestic market. This goalis to be achieved by increasing the amount outstanding of the individualbenchmark issues. This implies a strategy to issue and re-open benchmarkissues. <BR><BR>Auctions will be held for a particular benchmark bond repeatedly, with C$1billion to C$2.5 billion sold at each auction. For example, in March 1996the government raised its targets for the benchmark bonds. The ranges nowset for 2-year and 3-year benchmarks are C$5 billion to C$7 billion, andfor the 5-year, 10-year and 30-year benchmarks the targets are C$7billionto C$10 billion. <BR><BR>On the Thursday prior to the actual auction date on the following Wednesday,the Bank of Canada announces the maturity and size of the issue. At thatpoint, active open market trading begins on a yield basis in the When Issuedmarket. The details announced to the market include the term, the amountto be auctioned, the maturity date and, if the bond is being re-opened,the coupon level; for a new bond, the coupon level is set the followingWednesday at the auction based on the average yield at the auction. On theauction date, bids are submitted to the Bank of Canada and dealers receivebonds &shyp; up to 20% of the total issued &shyp; based on the competitivenessof their bids. <BR><BR><B>Yield calculation and the shape of the yield curve</B> <BR><BR>Yield calculations on all domestic Canadian dollar government bonds aresemi-annual with accrued interest calculated on an actual/365 day basis.Following a completed trade, good delivery for Canada bonds less than threeyears in maturity must occur on the second clearing day. Government of Canadabonds greater than three years maturity, and all provincial, municipal andcorporate bonds, must be delivered within three business days. <BR><BR>Over recent years, liquidity in the Canada market has continued to improve,resulting in a narrowing of bid-offer spreads. Currently, bid-offer pricespreads are typically 2&#162; for 2-year bonds, 5&#162; for 5-year bonds,7&#162; for 10-year bonds and 10&#162; for 20-year and 30-year trades. Currently,individual institutional transactions in the government market are typicallyin the C$25 million to C$50 million range. However, C$100 million to C$200million tickets are reasonably common, with C$250 million to C$500 milliontrades being done on occasion. <BR><BR>Chart 2 shows the slope of the Canadian yield curve (the spread between2-year and 10-year yields) since 1980. The chart shows that currently thecurve is quite steep. This reflects the Bank of Canada's aggressive loweringof interest rates, to below those in the US, in light of Canada's slow growthand low inflation. However, the curve has been steeper in recent years,particularly during the bull market of 1993. <BR><BR><I>By Jeffrey Rubin and Daniel Kelly <BR><BR>Tel:(416) 594-7357 7371</I> <BR><BR><I>CFA (416) 594-7371</I> <BR><BR><I>Fax: (416) 956-6117</I><BR><BR> <B>For further information,please contact youraccount officer in: <BR><BR></B>London 44 171 234 7163 <BR><BR>Institutional 44 171 234 7119 <BR><BR>Non-institutional Toronto 1 416 594 8513 <BR><BR>New York 1 212 856 6608 <BR><BR>Singapore 65 538 9177 <BR><BR>Tokyo 813 5512 8900 <BR><BR>Hong Kong 852 284 16111 <BR><BR>On Bloomberg Type WG <BR><BR>On Reuters Type WGBA <p></td></tr></table><br><nobr><a href="em.96.05.23.index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Back a Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt1.gif" alt="Back"></a><a href="../../../../../services/faqs.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Help';return true"><img width=22 height=22 hspace=90 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt2.gif" alt="Help"></a><a href="#top" onMouseOver="window.status='Top of the Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt3.gif" alt="Top"></a></nobr><br><br><nobr><a href="../../../../../alert/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='ALERT - Discussion Groups, Latest News, Site Updates, Sponsors and Events Diary';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav1.gif" alt="Alert"></a><a href="../../../../../search/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SEARCH - Keyword and Structured Searches';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav2.gif" alt="Search"></a><a href="../../../../../services/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SERVICES - FAQs, Feedback, Problems and EMWL Team';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav3.gif" alt="Services"></a><a href="../../../../../contents/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='CONTENTS - Publications, World Map, Product Sections and Data';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav44.gif" alt="Contents"></a></nobr></font><br><br><font size=2>All material subject to strictly enforced copyright laws. 1996&copy; <a href="MAILTO:pbrady@pobox.com">Euromoney Publications PLC.</a></font><br></center></body></html>

We expect the dropfrom high to low growth to remain at least until early 1997. Private consumptionwill be hurt by deteriorating consumer confidence and only a small risein real disposable income. The poor export performance in 1995 will continuein 1996. In 1997, however, higher international economic growth and lowerdomestic wage increases may result in a considerable rise in exports. <BR><BR><B>Inflation and budget deficit fulfil the convergence criteria</B> <BR><BR>Tougher conditions on the labour market and weak domestic demand will keepinflationary pressures in check. Inflation is expected to average only 2.1%in 1996 &shyp; the same level as in 1995. This meets the Maastricht convergencecriterion on inflation. The Danish public sector deficit is still amongthe lowest in the EU. In 1995, the deficit was only 1.5% of GDP and in 1996,the deficit is expected to rise to only 1.7% of GDP, thus comfortably exceedingthe Maastricht convergence criterion of a deficit below 3% of GDP. The publicsector deficit does not fulfil the convergence criterion of a debt ratiobelow 60% of GDP, though. The consolidated gross debt of the public sectorseems set to be 68% of GDP in 1996. However, this does represent a sharpfall from the 80% figure in 1993. <BR><BR><B>Denmark - the only solid alternative to Germany</B> <BR><BR>Although the Danish population rejected the single currency in May 1993,the lion's share of the Danish parliament is in favour. Hence, fulfilmentof the Maastricht criteria is a primary politico-economic goal. Consideringthe uncertainty surrounding the realisation of a single currency, coupledwith the success of the Danish monetary and fiscal authorities in achievingthese goals, we expect further narrowing of the yield spreads between Denmarkand the other hard-core currencies (see table 1). <BR><BR>Add to this a stable currency as well as converging yields and Danish bondsoffer a significant pick-up in expected holding-period returns comparedto other European hard-core currencies. After the convergence of the Frenchand German yield curves, Denmark is the only solid alternative to Germanyamong the hard-core currencies. <BR><BR><B>Gross domestic borrowing requirement significantly down</B> <BR><BR>The gross borrowing domestic requirement, reflecting the issue of Danishkrone-denominated government bonds, is rapidly falling; from a high of Dkr138billion in 1995 to Dkr103 billion in 1996, with a level of Dkr70 billionexpected in 1997. The sharp reduction in gross supply lends support to ourprojections of lower interest rates. All securities issued by the Danishcentral bank are issued on a tap basis. <BR><BR><B>Mortgage bonds an interesting alternative to government bonds</B> <BR><BR>Roughly 58% of the total outstanding volume in the Danish bond market ismade up of callable mortgage bonds. Of this share, 22% is represented bythe 10, 15, 20 and 30-year annuities with a coupon of 6%. In early 1996,foreign investors held 4% of the mortgage bonds corresponding to Dkr36 billion.As European yield curves continue to converge, investors are expected tolook for other markets offering a yield pick-up, without compromising onthe credit and liquidity risks. As Danish mortgage bonds meet this demand,we anticipate that the share of Danish mortgage bonds held by foreign investorswill grow in the next 12 months. The yield pick-up on these bonds, illustratedin the graph, is significant considering the high liquidity, the low prepaymentrisk as well as the low credit risk. <BR><BR><I>By J&oslash;rgen C Hansen and Frank Velling</I>  <BR><BR></B><B>Table 1: Key economic indicators(change in %)</B> <TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=1> <TR ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP="."><TD></TD><TD></TD> <TD>1995</TD> <TD></TD> <TD>1996e</TD> <TD></TD> <TD>1997e</TD></TR><TR ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP="."><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Private consumption</TD><TD COLSPAN=2 >2.3</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >1.6</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >3.0</TD></TR> <TR ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP="."><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Gross fixed investments</TD><TD COLSPAN=2 >11.0</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >3.3</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >2.3</TD></TR> <TR ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP="."><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Exports</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >1.0</TD><TD COLSPAN=2 >1.8</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >5.0</TD> </TR> <TR ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP="."><TD ALIGN="LEFT">GDP</TD><TD COLSPAN=2 >2.6</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >1.3</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >1.8</TD></TR> <TR ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP="."><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Current account/GDP</TD><TD COLSPAN=2 >0.8</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >0.7</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >0.7</TD></TR> <TR ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP="."><TD ALIGN="LEFT">PSBR/GDP</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >2.6</TD><TD COLSPAN=2 >1.3</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >1.8</TD> </TR> <TR ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP="."><TD ALIGN="LEFT">CPIaverage</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >2.1</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >2.1</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >2.3</TD></TR> </TABLE> <HR><B>For information on Carnegie's fixed-income products,please contact:</B> <BR><BR><B>Overgaden neden Vandet 9B</B> <B>DK-1414 <BR>Copenhagen K</B> <B>Denmark</B> <BR><B>Tel: +45 32 88 02 44</B> <BR><B>Fax: +45 32 96 10 22 <BR>Reuters codes: CARN12-14</B> <BR><BR><I>A member of the Copenhagen Stock Exchange</I> <p></td></tr></table><br><nobr><a href="em.96.05.23.index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Back a Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt1.gif" alt="Back"></a><a href="../../../../../services/faqs.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Help';return true"><img width=22 height=22 hspace=90 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt2.gif" alt="Help"></a><a href="#top" onMouseOver="window.status='Top of the Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt3.gif" alt="Top"></a></nobr><br><br><nobr><a href="../../../../../alert/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='ALERT - Discussion Groups, Latest News, Site Updates, Sponsors and Events Diary';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav1.gif" alt="Alert"></a><a href="../../../../../search/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SEARCH - Keyword and Structured Searches';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav2.gif" alt="Search"></a><a href="../../../../../services/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SERVICES - FAQs, Feedback, Problems and EMWL Team';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav3.gif" alt="Services"></a><a href="../../../../../contents/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='CONTENTS - Publications, World Map, Product Sections and Data';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav44.gif" alt="Contents"></a></nobr></font><br><br><font size=2>All material subject to strictly enforced copyright laws. 1996&copy; <a href="MAILTO:pbrady@pobox.com">Euromoney Publications PLC.</a></font><br></center></body></html>

Much of it is an opposition of principle. The averageGerman does not object to the concept of Emu so much as its practical implementationand the effect that this would have on the value of his or her savings.We believe these concerns are not valid. Furthermore, bond markets are nowfully pricing in the early advent of Emu and perhaps are not giving fullconsideration to the many uncertainties that remain about Emu's bond marketimplications. <BR><BR>The root of fears about the future value of the Deutschmark lie in the observationthat the Dm/Ecu exchange rate has fallen by about 10% over the last fiveyears. In other words, if the Deutschmark is part of Emu, it will be replacedby a currency that is much weaker than itself. A secondary aspect of theseworries is that the European Central Bank (ECB) will not be as vigilantabout maintaining price stability as the Bundesbank has undoubtedly beenand that real bond returns have once again become uncertain. <BR><BR>The problem with the fear that the Ecu is an unworthy successor to the Deutschmarkis that this belief is based on comparing apples with oranges. <BR><BR>The Ecu that has fallen so much in value against the Deutschmark over thelast 5 years is a basket currency. Among the twelve currencies includedin that basket are a number that are hardly renowned for their strength,such as sterling, the lira, the peseta, the escudo and the drachma. Betweenthem these currencies only account for up to some 23% of the current weightingof the Ecu, but as the accompanying chart clearly shows, they are responsiblefor 100% of the depreciation of the current basket Ecu against the Deutschmarksince 1990. <BR><BR>When Emu takes place, the currency that would replace the Deutschmark willnot even be called the Ecu, and it would differ in a number of crucial andfundamental ways from the currency that we now call the Ecu. The Euro willno longer be a basket currency at all, but the legal currency of a numberof countries; and the Maastricht criteria are there precisely to ensurethat only the strongest countries in Europe are included in that group.As a result, the Euro that the Deutschmark would turn into would have little,if any, of the weakness associated with the current basket currency Ecu.A '&quot;strong basket&quot;, consisting only of the Deutschmark, the Frenchfranc, the Dutch guilder, the Belgian and Luxembourg Francs, the Danishkroner and the Irish punt, would have depreciated by an average of lessthan 0.2% per annum, or a total of just over 1%, since January 1990 whenthe Ecu was last recomposed. <BR><BR>In the six-and-a-half years since then we have witnessed episodes of hugetension within the ERM, particularly in September 1992 and August 1993,yet the Deutschmark value of the &quot;strong basket&quot; never deviatedby even as much as 2% from the value of the Deutschmark. Even more surprisingto those who have blindly accepted the arguments of Emu opponents, the &quot;strongbasket&quot; has spent over 80% of the time since January 1990 being strongerthan the Deutschmark. Only episodes of extreme speculation against the ERMhave prevented this &quot;strong basket&quot; from tracking the value ofthe Deutschmark even more accurately. <BR><BR>What does all of this mean? In a nutshell, neither the German investor northe German population has any legitimate reason to fear the conversion ofthe Deutschmark: the Ecu that is talked about as having depreciated by some10% against the Deutschmark over the last five years is not the Euro proposedfor Emu. The &quot;strong basket&quot;, which is the closest approximationwe can construct for the post-Emu Ecu, has in fact behaved much benignlyand should not be held up as a dangerous successor to the Deutschmark. (Itis worth noting as an aside that the Ecu's composition was frozen when theMaastricht Treaty was ratified in early 1992. Hence the currencies of thethree currencies which have since joined the European Union - the Austrianschilling, the Swedish krona and the Finnish markka - will never be partof the Ecu basket.) <BR><BR>While worries about the Euro's value are not founded on any correct analysisof recent history, past performance is, of course, no guarantee of futurebehaviour. This brings up the second concern about Emu: that the ECB willnot have the same control over the Euro that the Bundesbank is widely believedto exercise over the Deutschmark. <BR><BR>The external value of the Deutschmark is not actually part of the Bundesbank'sresponsibilities, but its price stability certainly is. The general structureof the ECB is known, and the Bundesbank was instrumental in designing itin the months of work that led to Maastricht. <BR><BR>The Bundesbank's view about the results is contained in its 1991 annualreport. Just a few months after the Maastricht conference the Bundesbank'sverdict on the proposed ECB was quite clear: &quot;The Bundesbank too, isof the opinion that the provisions of the Treaty, and the Statute of thefuture....ECB, largely meet the requirements of monetary policy geared tothe goal of price stability. In some respects..... the provisions of theTreaty actually extend beyond what is included in the Bundesbank Act. Inaddition, the Statute of....the ECB affords better protection in legal termsthan the Bundesbank Act.&quot; <BR><BR>Of course it is not just the structure of the institution which will actuallydetermine whether or not the ECB is successful in maintaining price stability,but structure is a crucial component and it is impossible to speculate onthe other important factors. We do not know how the ECB will react to politicalpressure (which will never be direct), or how it will resolve internal disagreementsat a council level. These are questions that cannot be answered in advance,but they are also questions we could ask about the Bundesbank. Perhaps itwould have been better to leave the previous system alone, in the post-warera when the Bundesbank was founded, on the grounds that we did not yethave answers to these questions. Or was it right to take a risk then? No-onecan tell what will happen in the council of the ECB, or whether the monetarypolicy adopted in the age of the Euro will be optimal (or even just good).All we know is that the most independent experts on central banking thinkthat the framework is right; and if that is what the Bundesbank thinks,we should be willing to take the risk. <BR><BR>In addition, Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, has helped to focusthe debate on post-Emu economic policy by insisting that the Maastrichtcriteria be maintained beyond the introduction of the Euro. In fact it hasalways been the case that the criteria would continue to apply, both forcountries using the Euro, and those which have not yet adopted it, but Waigel'sinsistence on the matter is welcome. <BR><BR>He has also suggested tightening the deficit criterion, pointing out that3% should be a maximum, not an average. This suggestion has not yet beenapproved by the EU's Council of Ministers, but it is sure to be a topicof debate during the inter-governmental conference which began on March29 and will run for the next year or so. It should be noted that Waigel'ssuggestions for penalties against countries that persistently breach theMaastricht limits are actually already contained in the Maastricht Treaty, and therefore do not need any further approval. But it is always helpfulfor a politician to underline the fact that countries will remain underclose scrutiny even after Emu. <BR><BR>The antagonism to Emu expressed by the popular European press is not evidentin the market performance of Ecu bonds, as the chart above shows. Not onlyhas the spread between actual and theoretical narrowed to parity, but alsothe government market spreads of many of the most likely, and some of themost unlikely participants in Emu have converged dramatically. The bet inplace: political will to overwhelm popular worry. <BR><BR>The road to Emu must surely hold a few surprises which will arise from thedisparity between popular and political views, and a few shocks for bondinvestors. Fundamental questions surrounding harmonization and implementationof economic and monetary policy severely limit our ability to simulate apost-Emu bond market environment. <BR><BR>There is no true comparison for government markets whose only point of differentiationis their credit standing. History offers no parallels. The opportunity anddiversification benefits across markets, and the development of these overtime, remain shrouded by the uncertainty of details not yet debated or agreed.This uncertain background and its political nature should command a higherrisk premium, a higher compensation for volatility than is currently evidentin the government securities markets of the most likely participants. <BR><BR><I>By Chris Golden and Con Keating, Fixed Income Research</I><BR><B>Fixed Income Research</B> <BR><BR><B>Chris Golden 171 521 2006</B> <BR><BR><B>Bonds Sales Management</B> <BR><BR><B>Mark Goldman 171 521 2036</B> <BR><B>Sandy MacKenzie 171 521 2161</B> <BR><B>Mark Tate 171 521 2052</B> <BR><BR>Nomura International plc, <BR>Nomura House, <BR>1 St Martin's-le-Grand, <BR>London EC1A 4NP <BR><BR>Nomura International plc is regulated by the Securities and Futures Authorityand a member of the London Stock Exchange <p></td></tr></table><br><nobr><a href="em.96.05.23.index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Back a Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt1.gif" alt="Back"></a><a href="../../../../../services/faqs.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Help';return true"><img width=22 height=22 hspace=90 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt2.gif" alt="Help"></a><a href="#top" onMouseOver="window.status='Top of the Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt3.gif" alt="Top"></a></nobr><br><br><nobr><a href="../../../../../alert/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='ALERT - Discussion Groups, Latest News, Site Updates, Sponsors and Events Diary';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav1.gif" alt="Alert"></a><a href="../../../../../search/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SEARCH - Keyword and Structured Searches';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav2.gif" alt="Search"></a><a href="../../../../../services/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SERVICES - FAQs, Feedback, Problems and EMWL Team';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav3.gif" alt="Services"></a><a href="../../../../../contents/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='CONTENTS - Publications, World Map, Product Sections and Data';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav44.gif" alt="Contents"></a></nobr></font><br><br><font size=2>All material subject to strictly enforced copyright laws. 1996&copy; <a href="MAILTO:pbrady@pobox.com">Euromoney Publications PLC.</a></font><br></center></body></html>

Although there are parallels in valuations andinvestor structure, inflation rates and money market rates are much lowerthan two years ago and there is still scope for Fed easing, while priorto the 1994 bond crash the Fed had signalled rising interest rates. <BR><BR>The yield curve, which in 1994 had been inverted up to about 3 years, isvery steep, and investors generally are less exposed than in 1994. Againstthis background, we see German bonds at the beginning of a fairly calm period.Yields temporarily have matched our year-end forecasts; thus we expect volatilityaround present levels but with no clear cut trend for the remainder of thisyear. <BR><BR>We forecast money market rates to remain nearly static around current levelsand 10-year bond yields to be range-bound between 6% and 7%; there willbe only moderate yield rises in 1997. In the year ahead, it is not so muchdirectional views that will be rewarded, but riding the curve and the adeptexploitation of the fluctuations in yields, the yield curve shape and sectorspreads. <BR><BR><B>Main determinants of German bond yields</B> <BR><BR>The most important determinants of German bond yields are &shyp; in thefollowing order &shyp; international (mainly US) yield developments, Bundesbankpolicy and the outlook for Emu. <BR><BR>Whereas the short end of the curve is nearly exclusively Bundesbank-drivenand thereby reflects domestic fundamentals, the long end primarily reflectsUS yield developments. Intermediate maturities are sensitive to talk aboutthe prospects for Emu. <BR><BR><B>International economic outlook</B> <BR><BR>The US has overcome an inventory correction, setting the stage for at leasttwo more years of low-inflation growth. Japan is finding its way out ofa long recession and emerging markets continue to boom. <BR><BR>World growth will be 4% in 1997, the strongest since 1988. Recovery in Europewill be limited by further fiscal tightening. The nemesis of bond markets,inflation, is generally of no concern. <BR><BR><B>German data still soft, turn in the second quarter</B> <BR><BR>The current mini-recession in Germany is a mid-cycle stock adjustment, aggravatedby fiscal tightening. (As the next electoral test is not before October1996, the government is busily pushing through a spending cut package ofDm50 billion so that Germany meets all the Maastricht convergence criteriafor Emu in 1997). <BR><BR>Recovery should set in during the second quarter of the year, however, basedon low interest rates, low inflation and the recent small drop of the Deutschmark.Private consumption will provide the main impetus for growth, on the backof tax changes and high pay increases in the preceding year. <BR><BR>Unemployment remains a grave problem. Bond investors should not place toomany hopes on this lagging indicator. CPI inflation will fall to 1.2% bymid-year. If VAT is raised by 1% in January, inflation will straddle the2% mark again; otherwise it will remain below 2% throughout 1997. <BR><BR><B>Bundesbank: loose talk, little action</B> <BR><BR>The Bundesbank will leave the discount rate unchanged through 1997 and makeonly cosmetic cuts in the repo. It will still try to foster rate cut expectations,however, to calm the long end. <BR><BR><B>Can Germany decouple from the USA?</B> <BR><BR>Despite an ever-increasing correlation of Bunds to US Treasuries, the yieldspread between Germany and the USA has moved so far this year from +30bpto &shyp;30bp. Bunds will continue to outperform Treasuries, but generallymove in the same direction as T-bonds. Major yield divergences have happenedonly twice in the past 25 years. <BR><BR><B>Yield curve</B> <BR><BR>Most comforting for Deutschmark bonds is the steepness of the yield curve.Historically, a 300bp spread between 10-year yields and money market hasbeen all but insurmountable. <BR><BR>The carry allows for yields to rise by 50bp at the long end, and considerablymore in the shorter and intermediate segment due to roll-down effects (capitalgains from moving down the yield curve). <BR><BR><B>Domestic investors reliable</B> <BR><BR>Besides the Bundesbank, domestic investors are putting a lid on a potentialyield rise. They have always been reluctant buyers at yield levels below6.5% and sellers at levels below 6%; but on the way up, they give strongsupport again to the market at yields between 6.5% and 6.75%. <BR><BR><B>Impact of Emu</B> <BR><BR>Doubts have arisen in the market whether Emu will start on time. If theschedule regains more credibility, the likely results are higher yields,an even steeper yield curve and a weakening of the Deutschmark. The newEuropean central bank, the European Monetary Institute, will have to earnthe confidence the Bundesbank already enjoys and domestic investors willbe very reluctant to extend into maturities beyond the Emu start date. <BR><BR><B>Relative value</B> <BR><BR>German bonds show relative value compared to JGBs and US Treasuries. Againsthigher-yielding Europe, the period of underperformance that started in thespring of last year will probably extend into the third quarter of thisyear due to ongoing portfolio adjustments. <BR><BR>As a result of the safe haven status of the Deutschmark, sound fiscal policyand the Bundesbank's credentials as an inflation fighter, foreign holdingsof Bunds have risen to about 50% of the outstanding total, while they stillremain below 1992 levels in the other European markets. <BR><BR>Yet history has shown that as soon as everybody talks of convergence, probablytowards year-end, it will be time to get back into the Deutschmark. Theyield disadvantage of Bunds versus high-yielding markets in the past hasusually been compensated for by the Deutschmark's appreciation. <BR><BR>In periods of uncertainty, Deutschmark paper tends to outperform. Spreadsto high yielders are within 80bp of historical lows, against the Europeanhard core within 20bp. <BR><BR>French forward swaps starting in 1999 yield less than the equivalent Germanswaps: this can hardly be sustainable even if Emu happens. <BR><BR><I>Reiner Back</I> <I>Kleinwort Benson Research GmbH</I> <I>A member ofDresdner Group</I> <bR><B>Monetary forecasts Germany (end of quarter)</B><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=1> <TR><TD> </TD> <TD COLSPAN=3>1996</TD><TD></TD> <TD></TD> <TD></TD> <TD></TD> <TD></TD> <TD></TD> <TD></TD> <TD></TD><TD COLSPAN=3>1997</TD> </TR> <TR ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP="."><TD></TD> <TD></TD><TD></TD> <TD>Q1</TD> <TD></TD> <TD>Q2</TD> <TD></TD> <TD>Q3</TD> <TD></TD><TD>Q4</TD> <TD></TD> <TD>Q1</TD> <TD></TD> <TD></TD> <TD>Q2</TD> </TR><TR ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP="."><TD ALIGN="LEFT">3m eurodeposit (%)</TD> <TD></TD><TD COLSPAN=2 >3.4</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >3.2</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >3.2</TD><TD COLSPAN=2 >3.3</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >3.3</TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >3.4</TD></TR> <TR ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP="."><TD ALIGN="LEFT">10yr Yield (%)</TD> <TD></TD><TD COLSPAN=2 >6.4</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >6.3</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >6.5</TD><TD COLSPAN=2 >6.5</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >6.75</TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >6.75</TD></TR> <TR ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP="."><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Inflation (West) (%)</TD><TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >1.5</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >1.2</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >1.3</TD><TD COLSPAN=2 >1.3</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >1.9</TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >2.0</TD></TR> <TR ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP="."><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Dm/$</TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >1.48</TD><TD COLSPAN=2 >1.57</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >1.50</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >1.45</TD><TD COLSPAN=2 >1.40</TD> <TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN=2 >1.35</TD> </TR> </TABLE><p></td></tr></table><br><nobr><a href="em.96.05.23.index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Back a Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt1.gif" alt="Back"></a><a href="../../../../../services/faqs.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Help';return true"><img width=22 height=22 hspace=90 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt2.gif" alt="Help"></a><a href="#top" onMouseOver="window.status='Top of the Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt3.gif" alt="Top"></a></nobr><br><br><nobr><a href="../../../../../alert/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='ALERT - Discussion Groups, Latest News, Site Updates, Sponsors and Events Diary';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav1.gif" alt="Alert"></a><a href="../../../../../search/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SEARCH - Keyword and Structured Searches';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav2.gif" alt="Search"></a><a href="../../../../../services/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SERVICES - FAQs, Feedback, Problems and EMWL Team';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav3.gif" alt="Services"></a><a href="../../../../../contents/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='CONTENTS - Publications, World Map, Product Sections and Data';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav44.gif" alt="Contents"></a></nobr></font><br><br><font size=2>All material subject to strictly enforced copyright laws. 1996&copy; <a href="MAILTO:pbrady@pobox.com">Euromoney Publications PLC.</a></font><br></center></body></html>

According to the EFFAS methodology,the total return (measured in Deutschmarks) for a bond portfolio with maturitieslonger than 1 year amounted to 18.1%. <BR><BR>Although we are not yet half way through 1996, it is already certain thatthe fixed income investor will not be heading for a fantastic year, certainlywhen compared to 1995. Investors and analysts are even asking themselvesapprehensively whether history (1994) will repeat itself. We do not sharethis opinion. The differences with 1994 are so great that an increase ofthe 10-year bond yields to more than 7% appears to be quite out of the questionfor the coming twelve months. On the other hand, a decrease to less than6% appears to be equally unlikely, so that the space within which interestrates can fluctuate will be rather limited. We expect that in 12 months,10-year bond yields in the Netherlands could decline to 6.25%. <BR><BR><B>Structure of the Dutch bond market</B> <BR><BR>The primary Dutch bond market is strongly dominated by the Dutch government.But there has been increasing activity on the Euroguilder bond market, withsovereigns, supra-nationals, banks, insurance companies and corporates apparentlyable to rate the primary guilder market at its true value, an assessmentwhich is justified in our opinion. Investors as well are increasingly interestedin guilder paper from debtors other than the government, although the majorityof the fixed income portfolios will consist of plain vanilla governmentbonds. The vast majority of government bonds are 10-year bullets, althoughbullets with other tenors (15 years and 30 years) have been issued in thepast years. On the secondary market, the dominance of government bonds iseven stronger; they account for more than 90% of daily turnover. Thereforewe will confine our attention to government bonds. <BR><BR>The demand side of the bond market is much more varied. Institutional investors(pension funds and life insurance companies) are the most important party(representing 50%), although banks and private investors have a respectableshare of the issued government bonds in portfolio (27%). The quite significantrole of foreign parties in the absorption of the bond supply is striking(23%). The Agency of the Ministry of Finance (the Ministry of Finance bodywhich issues government bonds and which is responsible for the managementof the public debt) has played an important role in the internationalizationof the Dutch bond market. By means of various innovations (see box 1) theliquidity of the Dutch bond market has increased substantially. <BR><BR><B>Macro-economic background</B> <BR><BR>One of the most important characteristics of the Dutch economy is the lowlevel of inflation. From 1985 to 1994, only the Japanese CPI was on averagelower than the Dutch CPI. This excellent performance was mainly achievedby means of the monetary policy pursued by the Dutch central bank (DNB),which is directed towards the full pegging of the guilder to the Deutschmark.Germany and the Netherlands have agreed to guarantee the original 2.25%ERM bandwidth, while the other countries in the ERM switched to a 15% bandwidthafter September 1993. <BR><BR>By pegging the guilder to the Deutschmark the Bundesbank's anti-inflationpolicy is imported. Economic developments in Germany and the Netherlandsare reasonably synchronous, except for that the cyclical swings are greaterin Germany than in the Netherlands, because of the larger share of the cyclically-sensitiveindustrial sector in Germany. <BR><BR><B>The essentials of the spread</B> <BR><BR>It appears that the absolute level of Dutch long-term bond yields is actuallydetermined in Germany. In other words, there is a perfect coupling betweenGerman and Dutch interest rates, with about 95% of Dutch long-term interestrates being determined by German fundamentals and the remainder (the DutchGerman spread in practical terms) by the Dutch fundamentals. It appearsfrom graph 1 that this spread has moved within a fairly narrow band duringthe past few years: -20 to +20 basis points. One question which immediatelyarises is: what sets this spread in motion? <BR><BR>Experience has shown that the inflation differential between both countries,government finances, political and social stability, as well as the supplyand demand ratios on the bond market are the essentials of the spread. Bundsoften traded under DSLs in the past because in the perception of investorsthe Dutch bond market was less liquid than the German bond market. It shouldbe pointed out that there is no longer any question of this at present,partly on account of the above-mentioned innovations by the Agency of theMinistry of Finance (see box 1). <BR><BR><B>Economic outlook and yield forecasts</B> <BR><BR>Since the absolute interest level is actually determined in Germany, economicdevelopments in that country should be analysed in order to make a well-foundedjudgement about the future direction of Dutch interest rates. <BR><BR>Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that developments on the Germanbond market are strongly influenced by developments in the US, notwithstandingthe decoupling since the beginning of April of 1996. The ING growth andinflation estimates for both economic superpowers are substantially lowerthan the consensus estimates. A strong rise in bond yields is thereforeunlikely. On the other hand, we do not see any room for a substantial declinein bond yields either. In the US, monetary policy will remain on hold forthe time being (which is a major difference with 1994, when monetary policywas tightened), while a budget agreement will not be concluded in the shortterm. In Germany, investors continue to desire a 'risk premium' on accountof the uncertainty with regard to the Emu. <BR><BR>The starting point for the Dutch bond market is therefore neither favourablenor unfavourable. Given the economic fundamentals in the USA and Germany,we expect Dutch 10-year bond yields to decline to 6.25% in 12 months time.<BR><BR><B>PSBR is the key</B> <BR><BR>Of all the factors which influence the Dutch-German spread, the decisivefactor for the coming twelve months will be the development of the PSBR.As shown in graph 2, the PSBR falls considerably in 1996 and 1997. Thisis partly because of a reduction of the budget deficit, but particularlyon account of the decrease of the redemptions. The reduction of the budgetdeficit is mainly connected with the grossing operation on public housing,which was basically a balance sheet reduction, which inflated the budgetdeficit in 1995. The significant decline in redemptions is connected withthe fact that few government loans were issued ten years ago. <BR><BR>The result of all this is a substantial fall in the PSBR in 1996 and 1997,and thus a relative scarcity of Dutch government bonds both this year andnext. Since the government has already covered more than 50% of the PSBRthis year, the Agency of the Ministry of Finance decided not to issue anew loan in the second quarter of this year, but only to allow a tenderfor an existing loan. In the medium term, this relative scarcity will resultin Dutch 10-year bonds being traded under German 10-year bonds (Dutch yieldslower than German yields), as has been the case since March of this year.<BR><BR>Dutch government bonds are issued via a tap (Dutch auction) or a tender(the reopening of an existing loan). In this way, the Agency of the Ministryof Finance increases the liquidity of individual loans. While a seize ofFl 1 billion was considered to be a substantial loan 10 years ago, nowadaysa seize of Fl 15 billion is no longer an exception. The emphasis lies inthe 10-year area, although loans with a longer life have been issued. Thisfits within the Agency's strategy to extend the life of funded public debt,besides realizing the funding as cheaply and as smoothly as possible. Itshould also be noted that the Agency publishes an issue calendar at thebeginning of each quarter. <HR><B>Technical aspects</B> <BR><BR>In the Netherlands, there is an annual coupon, with the coupon date normallyfalling on the 1st or the 15th of the month. The interest is calculatedon the basis of a 30-day month / 360-day year, while the price of a bondis always quoted exclusive accrued interest. Settlement takes place threeworking days after the transaction date.

Spanish yields may fall to as low as 8% to 8.25% at 10 yearsas a result of this process in 1996, representing a narrowing of the yieldspread over Germany towards 200bp this year and 150bp next. What is importantis that this conclusion is not dependent on the limiting assumption of Spainjoining Emu as early as 1999. <BR><BR><B>EMU in 1999 Looks Ambitious for Spain</B> <BR><BR>Spain will most likely be excluded from the first round of Emu. Its publicdeficit is still some way from the 3% of GDP target and, perhaps more ofa problem in Spain's case, its public debt is not only above 60% of GDP(65.1% currently, see chart 2), but is still rising. Even inflation, at3.4% vastly improved from the 5.2% registered 12 months ago, nonethelesswould still leave Spain outside of Emu on inflation grounds. <BR><BR>But in terms of finding value in Spanish fixed-income securities, this isprobably of little importance. The forward curves currently price in a convergenceprocess which stops dead in its tracks after 1999. There is no limitingassumption of monetary union underpinning the prices of Spanish assets.Therefore, room for disappointment if Spain does not make it into Emu atthe start is limited. And yet Spanish policy and politics remain clearlyoriented to the Maastricht goal. This policy priority shows every indicationof surviving the passage of power from Felipe Gonzalez's Socialists to aright-dominated government under the leadership of Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;aAznar. <BR><BR>The political determination to achieve monetary union, even at the expenseof a growth cycle shortened by the necessary fiscal and monetary rigour,means that Spain's participation in a single currency should be viewed largelyas a question of time. <BR><BR><B>A New Look ERM</B> <BR><BR>In the meantime, the Spanish convergence programme will be smoothed by theparticipation of the Spanish peseta in a revamped exchange rate mechanism(ERM) after 1999. <BR><BR>Potential participants in the Euro currency consider the avoidance of competitivedevaluation by the non-Euro currencies to be a priority in the post-Emuworld. One means of discouraging such damaging devaluations would be forEuro members to offer an insurance policy to the high yielders, taking theform of unlimited and guaranteed bilateral currency support, excercisableonly in the case of a currency crisis. The premium paid on such an insurancepolicy by countries such as Spain would be the renouncement of devaluation.The degree of exchange rate cover received would depend on an assessmentof the depreciation risk for the Spanish peseta and each of the non-Eurocurrencies. This would determine the size of the new fixed, but revisable,ERM fluctuation bands. <BR><BR>The Spanish peseta has already demonstrated its ability to maintain a tighttrading range around Deutschmark within the current ERM framework. In theworst-case scenario, where Spain fails to join Emu in the initial phase,its ERM central rate is unlikely to be very different from its central ratetoday. Recent pressures on the Peseta/Deutschmark exchange rate have beento the downside not the upside and the peseta remains some 4% undervaluedrelative to purchasing power parity. There is strong justification for themaximum permissible fluctuation of the peseta to remain 15% from now untilSpain is finally ready to join the Euro. <BR><BR><B>Limited currency risk will narrow yield spread to target 150bp </B><BR><BR>If the exchange risk for Deutschmark/Peseta were to be bilaterally guaranteedat a maximum of 15%, fair value Spanish yields at 10 years should be nohigher than 150bp above Bunds. This compares with 290bp currently. Thisconclusion holds true independently of the size of the short-term inflationdifferential between the two countries, since the impact of higher inflationon currency movements would henceforth be restricted in this system. <BR><BR>But the importance of the above conclusion stretches beyond the potentialcapital gains which would therefore be on offer in long-dated peseta-denominatedassets. It would feed back into the whole economic convergence process.<BR><BR><B>Convergence Becomes More Credible</B> <BR><BR>By reducing the yield spread of Spain over hard-core Europe, the cost ofservicing outstanding Spanish public sector debt would fall significantly.Interest charge cuts of over 0.5% on the totality of Spanish debt, the consequenceof a limited Deutschmark/Peseta risk, would immediately reduce Spain's deficit/GDPratio by some 0.3%. This would simultaneously give credibility to the eventualattainment of the Maastricht deficit criterion and facilitate the stabilizationof debt/GDP. <BR><BR>As credibility in the Spanish fiscal convergence programme grew, additionalcapital flows would then be attracted into peseta assets and a virtuouscircle of lower yields, greater economic convergence and therefore greatermonetary convergence would be set in motion. Such a virtuous circle couldrender Spanish participation in Emu a reality after only a short delay.<BR><BR><B>Inflation Oriented Down</B> <BR><BR>Underpinning this process of exchange rate stability and fiscal and monetaryconvergence is an inflation trend which remains oriented downwards. Subduedfinal demand, and the need to maintain competitiveness in the face of astrong peseta, places a cap on the extent of consumer price increases. Costpressures are also subsiding, the result of diminishing capacity utilizationand important structural adjustments such as the ending of many public servicemonopolies and widescale privatizations. Labour reforms enacted in 1994have also enabled unit labour costs to sharply contract, by some 3.5% inreal terms over the past two years. With growth now slowing towards 2% in1996 and spare capacity increasing, the government target of 3.5% inflationthrough 1996 looks increasingly realistic. <BR><BR>This favourable inflation trend should gradually narrow the differentialwith Germany and the rest of the hard core towards 1.5% by early 1997. Spainwould then satisfy not only the exchange rate requirement for participationin the single currency, but also the inflation requirement. The attainmentof the Maastricht yield target, average European hard-core yields plus amaximum of 200bp, should then follow naturally. <BR><BR><B>Conclusion</B> <BR><BR>Spain's participation in the single currency can by no means be guaranteedfor 1999. The dynamics of its debt and deficits suggest that a little moretime may be necessary to fully achieve stabilization of public finances.But with the help of lower yields, as a result of both limited exchangerate risk which is bilaterally guaranteed by the members of the new Euroand a convergent inflation trend, debt stabilization could be achieved withonly a short delay after the start of Maastricht phase 3. <BR><BR>The convergence of Spanish long-term yields on the European hard-core couldbe very rapid through this process. We have forecast a 10-year yield spreadof 150bp for early 1997. The risk is that this target will be achieved morequickly than even we are forecasting. <p><H3>The European bond specialists </H3>Brussels Andr&eacute; Habay 322 505 9284 <BR>Copenhagen Merete Hyldmar 45 33 77 88 01 <BR>Madrid Patrick Daries 341 432 7808 <BR>Milan Andrea Cecchini 392 72 303 354 <BR>Paris Bertrand Sauzey 331 53 76 50 00 <BR>Stockholm Anders Wilson 468 454 5909 <p></td></tr></table><br><nobr><a href="em.96.05.23.index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Back a Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt1.gif" alt="Back"></a><a href="../../../../../services/faqs.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Help';return true"><img width=22 height=22 hspace=90 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt2.gif" alt="Help"></a><a href="#top" onMouseOver="window.status='Top of the Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt3.gif" alt="Top"></a></nobr><br><br><nobr><a href="../../../../../alert/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='ALERT - Discussion Groups, Latest News, Site Updates, Sponsors and Events Diary';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav1.gif" alt="Alert"></a><a href="../../../../../search/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SEARCH - Keyword and Structured Searches';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav2.gif" alt="Search"></a><a href="../../../../../services/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SERVICES - FAQs, Feedback, Problems and EMWL Team';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav3.gif" alt="Services"></a><a href="../../../../../contents/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='CONTENTS - Publications, World Map, Product Sections and Data';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav44.gif" alt="Contents"></a></nobr></font><br><br><font size=2>All material subject to strictly enforced copyright laws. 1996&copy; <a href="MAILTO:pbrady@pobox.com">Euromoney Publications PLC.</a></font><br></center></body></html>

Ona monthly basis, the correlation between 10-year Swiss and German governmentbond yields has been 82% in the period from 1987 to 1995. However, the Swissmarket continues to exhibit sufficient divergent behaviour for Swiss bondsto be an important and profitable diversification vehicle for internationalfixed income portfolios, particularly in periods of heightened internationalrisk. In the 1994 bear market, Swiss 10-year government bonds posted themost favourable performance of the major government bond markets in bothlocal currency and dollar terms, underlining Swiss bonds' value as a defensiveinvestment. In 1995, as global inflation expectations fell and bonds rallied,Swiss 10-year government bonds again posted the strongest performance ofthe major markets in dollar terms, suggesting that the Swiss market couldbe viewed by international investors as offering more than just a safe-haven.<BR><BR>While the Swiss government bond market is modest in size, the inclusionof Swiss bonds in the Salomon Brothers global bond index is a testamentto their importance. In January 1996, the Swiss franc denominated bond marketcomprises something over 2,000 issues which total, on a nominal basis, anoutstanding value of around Swfr 305 billion. Of this total, 60% can betermed domestic issues, with the remainder foreign. The most important issuerin the domestic market is the Swiss government. Central, cantonal and municipalgovernment bonds outstanding total Swfr55 billion, around 30% of total domesticoutstandings. <BR><BR>Tax is deducted in Switzerland from the interest or dividend payments onall domestic bonds. The nominal rate of taxation deducted at source is 35%.However, Switzerland has established double taxation treaties with a numberof countries resulting in the effective rate of tax deducted often beinglower. A summary of Switzerland's double taxation arrangements is providedin Table 1 (opposite). <BR><BR>Swiss Government bonds are tendered by Dutch auction. Since 1996, the tenderschedule has been bi-monthly (odd months). Normally, in auction months theterms of the issue are published in the morning of the third or fourth Tuesdayof the month. The subscription period then runs until the following Thursdayat 11.00 CET. The result of the auction is published shortly after 12.00CET. All of the paper auctioned is allocated at the last considered price.The Treasury has total discretion over the characteristics of the bond offeredat auction. The modest size of Switzerland's bond market is a reflectionof its public sector debt to GDP ratio which, at 50%, is low by internationalstandards. However, it should be noted that since 1991, when the ratio wasjust 30%, the trend has been upward. The cause for this rise can be tracedback to a bout of atypical fiscal profligacy at the end of the 1980s. Despitethe current economic weakness, however, efforts are underway to overhaulthe federal government's finances. The parliament approved a spending freezein 1995 which requires a qualified majority for additional spending overSwfr10 million, and the new finance minister is proposing a universal freezeon spending. This would involve incorporating the goal of reducing the deficitto a &quot;reasonable&quot; level into the Swiss constitution, with thistarget to be reached within six years. In addition to such general steps,specific measures to bring down spending over the medium term are also inthe pipeline. <BR><BR>Switzerland is a confederation of 23 &quot;sovereign&quot; cantons withits construction embodying the principles of subsidiarity and collectivedecision making. These principles have two important implications for bondmarket valuation. Firstly, the dispersion of fiscal responsibility to cantonaland community level has encouraged fiscal self-responsibility. Secondly,Switzerland has enjoyed an extremely stable political environment by internationalstandards. <BR><BR>Despite the rise of the public sector deficit, the Swiss Treasury is ina very comfortable financial position. The 1994 deficit was Swfr1.4 billionless than budgeted, allowing the Treasury to build a net-cash position forthe second year in a row. As a consequence, the government revised downits net borrowing target for 1995 from Swfr4.5 billion to Swfr3 billion.In fact, just Swfr2.01 billion net of new bonds were issued in 1995. Itshould be noted that the auction in November 1995 counted for the 1996 period,where the Treasury's net target has been set at Swfr2.8 billion. The pressureon yields from government issuance in the near term is therefore likelyto remain modest. <BR><BR>Like its bond market, Switzerland's economy is modest in size but well developedand sophisticated. The trend growth rate of productivity in Switzerlandis around 2% on an annual basis. However, Switzerland's growth has beenlacklustre throughout the nineties, allowing an output gap to develop. Giventhis estimate, and our forecast that the Swiss economy will again expandat a rate below its potential this year (0.7%), it is expected that theSwiss economy could sustain a period of above trend growth before capacityconstraints impose upward pressure to prices. The lack-lustre outlook forgrowth and absence of inflationary pressures suggests that official interestrates will remain low for some time, supporting the short end of the curve.<BR><BR><I>Paul Lambert, Senior Analyst</I> <BR><BR><bR><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=1> <TR><TD COLSPAN=4><B>Table1: Countries with double taxation agreements with Switzerland</B></TD> </TR> <TR><TD></TD><TD>Country</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2>Interest payable</TD> </TR> <TR><TD></TD><TD>Australia</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">10%</TD> </TR> <TR><TD></TD><TD>Netherlands</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">5%</TD> </TR><BR><TR><TD></TD> <TD>Austria</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">5%</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>New Zealand</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">10%</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>Belgium</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">10%</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>Norway</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">nil</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>Canada*</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">15%</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>Pakistan**</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">15%</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>Denmark</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">nil</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>Portugal</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">10%</TD></TR><BR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>Finland</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">nil</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>Singapore</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">10%</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>France</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">10%</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>South Africa***</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">35%</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>Germany</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">nil</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>Spain</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">10%</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>Ireland</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">nil</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>Sweden</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">5%</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>Italy</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">12.5%</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>United Kingdom</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">nil</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>Japan</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">10%</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>USA</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">5%</TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>Malaysia</TD> <TD></TD> <TD ALIGN="DECIMAL" DP=".">10%</TD></TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=4>*Total exemption for interest on government bonds</TD></TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=4>**Only for Pakistani companies</TD> </TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=4>***Norefund of Swiss tax at source as long as interest derived from foreign sourcesis not taxed in South Africa</TD> </TR> </TABLE> <HR><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=1><TR><TD COLSPAN=7><B>Table 2: Swiss government bond yield forecasts</B></TD></TR> <TR><TD></TD> <TD>Sep 96</TD> <TD>Dec 96</TD> <TD>Mar 97</TD> <TD>Jun97</TD> <TD>Sep 97</TD> <TD>Dec 97</TD> </TR> <TR><TD>10-Year</TD> <TD>4.25%</TD><TD>4.50%</TD> <TD>4.70%</TD> <TD>4.80%</TD> <TD>4.90%</TD> <TD>5.00%</TD></TR> <TR><TD>5-Year</TD> <TD>3.40%</TD> <TD>3.60%</TD> <TD>4.15%</TD> <TD>4.25%</TD><TD>4.45%</TD> <TD>4.65%</TD> </TR> <TR><TD>2-Year</TD> <TD>2.45%</TD> <TD>2.60%</TD><TD>3.00%</TD> <TD>3.60%</TD> <TD>3.80%</TD> <TD>4.30%</TD> </TR> <TR><TD>3-Month</TD><TD>2.10%</TD> <TD>2.10%</TD> <TD>2.40%</TD> <TD>3.00%</TD> <TD>3.50%</TD><TD>3.70%</TD> </TR> </TABLE> <p></td></tr></table><br><nobr><a href="em.96.05.23.index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Back a Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt1.gif" alt="Back"></a><a href="../../../../../services/faqs.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Help';return true"><img width=22 height=22 hspace=90 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt2.gif" alt="Help"></a><a href="#top" onMouseOver="window.status='Top of the Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt3.gif" alt="Top"></a></nobr><br><br><nobr><a href="../../../../../alert/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='ALERT -

<a href="wl.96.06.17.html"><H3> EGYPT </H3> </a>



<H4> A pivotal presence on the regional stage, Egypt has yet to give the majority
of its people a political voice </H4> 

<H3> Peace at the right price </H3> 

<P>
<I>By Jon Marks</I> 

 <P> Most people are surprised when President Hosni
Mubarak gets angry. He got very angry this summer as Arab fears that Benjamin
Netanyahu's Israeli government would derail the fragile Middle East peace process
were confirmed.

<P> As one of Mubarak's ministers said soon after the president threatened to
cancel the November 12-14 MENA summit: "There were times when we didn't know what
was happening, when the <I>rais</I> [president] was so clearly angry with Israel
[that] it might even outweigh our need to mobilise new investment through the
Middle East peace process. All we could do was continue working and watch."

<P> During his 15 years as president, Mubarak has rarely been known to play to
the crowd. Haunted by the memory of his predecessor &#009;Anwar Sadat's murder by
Islamist militants during an army parade in 1981 and an assassination attempt as
he arrived for last year's Organisation of African Unity summit in Addis Ababa,
Mubarak has overseen only the most cautious of political openings at home.

<P> During the first years of his presidency, the press was allowed to flourish
and opposition leaders and intellectuals released from jail. But when police
rioted over pay and conditions in 1986 and the Islamist-dominated opposition took
100 of 444 seats in parliamentary elections the year after, the scope for
opposition began to shrink once more.

<P> Since 1992, when the Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group) launched its violent
struggle to overthrow the regime, considerable resources have been devoted to
beating back a low-level but persistent insurgency. Islamist underground groups
have killed nearly 1,000 people, according to press reports. Their grievances are
largely domestic: it is no surprise that the Gama'a heartland is poverty-stricken
Upper Egypt.

<P> But the continuing cancer of political turbulence in the wider Middle East
region also exacerbates internal problems. This point was made in April, when 18
Greek tourists were slaughtered at a hotel near the Giza pyramids. They had been
mistaken by radical Islamists for Israelis. Otherwise Egypt and its capital
remain remarkably peaceful compared with the majority of other big countries,
despite the millions living in poverty.

<P><B> Islamist threat diminishes </B> <P> The threat posed by armed Islamist
groups has lessened this year. Most violence is focused on a small area of Upper
Egypt between Minya and Assiut.

<P> Pressure is telling on the Gama'a, whose offer of a ceasefire last spring was
ignored by the government. "There will be no dialogue with killers and
assassins," interior minister Hassan al-Alfi declared in May.

<P> In its conflict with radical Islam, the state has become preoccupied with
outflanking the proscribed Muslim Brotherhood in its strategy to become Egypt's
main parliamentary opposition. "The Muslim Brotherhood is the key to the whole
problem," Al-Alfi has said. "It has deep roots in Egypt and it has tried and is
still trying to reach power through legal or illegal means." The Brotherhood
started modern Islamic revivalism in Egypt in 1928, but has been banned since
1954.

<P> Successive governments turned a blind eye to its activities, until pressure
from the Gama'a and Jihad (Holy War) movements and a wave of pro-Islamist
sentiment forced a response. The government then argued that the Brotherhood was
little more than a political front for hardline Muslim groups.

<P> The crackdown on Egypt's best-funded and organised movement intensified in
January 1995, when large numbers of its leaders were jailed following military
trials on the eve of parliamentary elections.

<P> Most intriguing for those waiting to see a new political configuration emerge
has been the government's reaction to Al-Wasat, a new and ostensibly liberal
"centre party" whose programme espouses <I>itjihad</I>, the modernisation of
Islamic law and practice. This modernisation, Al-Wasat argues, is essential to
deal with changes unforeseen by the Prophet. Another novelty is that Al-Wasat's
74 founder members include women and several Coptic Christians, the community
most often targeted by groups such as Gama'a.

<P> However, the majority of Al-Wasat's founder members are young Islamist
activists seen by analysts close to the government as being more of a threat than
the Muslim Brotherhood's relatively conservative leaders. The movement's leader,
engineer Abul-Ala Madi, has been jailed for allegedly heading a conspiracy to
overthrow the regime.

<P> There are fears that unless the government reaches some accommodation with a
diffuse Islamist revivalist movement and begins to distinguish between dissent
and terrorism, opponents who could work within the system and make a vital
contribution to Egypt's economic and social development will be alienated or even
driven underground into the estimated 40,000 unlicensed mosques.

<P> To reduce pressures and produce a more responsive polity, liberals are
arguing for a more rapid opening to democracy in a system shaped by Sadat.
Parliamentary elections held in November last year saw the ruling National
Democratic Party (NDP) win 416 of the 444 seats contested. The NDP posted a
better performance than in 1990, when most of the country's 13 opposition parties
boycotted the poll.

<P> The Muslim Brotherhood's attempt to translate its social and trade union
influences into parliamentary representation raised the temperature markedly.
Some 51 people were killed and more than 800 injured during the election when
polling was preceded by waves of arrests. The Brotherhood was banned and its
Cairo headquarters closed.

<P><B> Into the next century </B> <P> A critical question is whether, and how
much, the majority of Egyptians actively want political change. Analysts predict
that Mubarak, seen as a guarantor of political stability, will win a fourth
presidential term in 1999. By declining to name a vice-president or signal his
successor, Mubarak shows every sign of carrying Egypt over the threshold of the
21st century.

<P> A rare opinion poll on regional and domestic political issues conducted by
Al-Ahram Weekly and the Almishkat Centre for Research and Training in late 1994
showed a high degree of apathy. The author, Nader Fergany, was persuaded that
most people remain at the margins of political life, with ideas that contrast
markedly to the results of the general election held one year later.

<P> The poll's findings show that the official mass media represents the most
important information source for more than 95% of Egyptians and that political
participation was nearly a complete monopoly of men, with party membership
concentrated among males aged 30-50. Voters for opposition parties showed "a
stronger representation of higher levels of educational attainment and a more
balanced representation of voters on age and gender brackets".

<P> One finding will have caused deep concern to the authorities. The poll showed
that those who were unemployed were more likely to believe that "violent Islamic
groups work for the benefit of the people". At the other end of the social scale,
the survey revealed a notable aversion to politics among the highest occupational
categories.

<P> The survey also showed a high degree of enmity towards Israel, especially
among older voters. The government knows this only too well. One reason for
Mubarak's anger this summer was that the Netanyahu government's behaviour
undermined Egypt's argument that solid adherence to the peace process is in
everyone's interest.

<P> According to foreign minister Amr Moussa, "to fulfil our economic objectives,
peace and stability must prevail". With peace, he says: "Egypt will become a
regional centre for economic development." But peace at any price is not
acceptable, especially if it means sacrificing Palestinian and other essential
national rights.

<P> Cairo's decision to remove the kid gloves with Israel seems to have been
finely judged to mobilise Arab sentiment behind the president and add to pressure
on Netanyahu, without overturning the peace process. Following Mubarak's decision
to let the MENA summit go ahead, Cairo is ready to reassert the central position
in the Arab world it held during the 1990-91 Gulf War, when it took the role of
broker between Arab states, the US and Israel.

<P> Mubarak's directness in threatening to cancel the MENA summit should have
rung alarm bells in the US and Israel. It came from a statesman whose consistent
and open-minded approach to the area's problems was reflected in a speech before
Netanyahu was elected. "I don't want to be rushed to give my impression before we
wait and see what Netanyahu's policies are," Mubarak said then. "Since we have
been able to work with Begin and Shamir, I see no reason why we can't work with
Netanyahu." Since then events in Israel have forced him to be less charitable

<P> When the going gets tough Egypt always moves back to centre-stage in the
Middle East. It is now for its leaders to consolidate this dominant position by
developing the political system to involve more people in the internal decisions
that affect their future.

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
The banking sector has been at the leading edge of economic reforms throughout
the economies of central Europe. For most of the more developed markets,
striving to join the European Union has given them a focus to get their
banking sectors in order, and fast. The majority of countries in the region
have created sound legislative frameworks based on international banking
principles and double-tier banking systems around the core of a broadly
independent central bank. However, the hard work is by no means over. The
difficult task has been to make sure that the banks that have been created
are able to survive and operate according to commercial principles and,
ultimately, to stand on their own feet. <BR>
<BR>
Consolidation has been the main theme over the past year for the more developed
central European markets as banks try and get their balance sheets in order.
For instance, while laws dictate BIS capital adequacy ratios of 8% be enforced
in most central European countries, these norms are still a long way off
for many banks. <BR>
<BR>
Having opted for a programme of extensive state support for restructuring
banks balance sheets, Hungary is furthest down the track in many ways. The
experience of handling several problems in the banking sector in the first
four years of reform, in part brought about by 1992's bankruptcy laws and
changes in accounting procedures, has left the supervisory mechanism more
robust. A two-phase consolidation programme is now nearing completion. Mergers
among the smaller banks continue apace, meanwhile, several of the larger
banks have reduced their capital base and have been restructured, allowing
them to announce sizeable profits last year. The restructuring programme
brought with it an actual increase in the state's ownership of the banking
sector and Hungary's banking privatization programme for the larger banks
has only developed serious momentum over the past year, with three of the
big five now at least partially owned by the private sector. In August,
49% of Hungary's largest commercial bank Orszagos Takarekpenztar (OTP Bank),
was sold to private investors. GECC took a 60% stake in the second largest
bank, Budapest Bank, in December and in January the state offered to sell
its 24.7% stake in Hungary's foreign trade bank, Magyar Kulkereskedelmi
(MKB), to its existing foreign shareholders. And the state is also reducing
its holdings in smaller banks. In late March, Hungary's state privatisation
agency APV announced a one-round public tender to sell its 50% stake in
Altalanos Ertekforgalmi Bank, which is capitalized at Ft1 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Like Hungary, banking in the Czech Republic is dominated by a few large
banks. The big four control over three-quarters of the market for loans
and deposits. The state is beginning to divest itself of some of its holdings
in these banks. In the second quarter of 1996 an offering of global shares
of up to 10% of the state's holding in Ceska Sporitelna, the largest Czech
savings bank is planned. Sales of global depositary receipts (GDRs) could
be the forerunner of other sales of bank stock to foreign investors. The
state's stake, which comprises a shareholding of over 45% in the bank, is
held by the National Property Fund (NFP). <BR>
<BR>
The need for central bank approval for any foreign acquisition of shares
in a Czech bank, up to a maximum 10%, is widely expected to be waived in
the second half of this year, attracting foreign investors and clearing
the way for GDRs to be converted back into publicly traded shares. <BR>
<BR>
The Czech Republic's fourth largest bank Investicni a Postovni Banka (IPB),
is the next candidate for privatization, and may be sold off entirely. Already,
the share of the state has been watered down through rights issues to one-third.
IPB has said it would like to issue GDRs to dilute the state's stake even
further. Selling the state's shares in the other two large banks, Komercni
Banka, the country's largest commercial bank, and Ceskoslovenska Obchodni
Banka, would be more difficult because Slovakia still has minority holdings
or claims in both. Komercni Banka, for one, has been one of the best performing
stocks in the Czech Republic, buoyed by a favourable earnings outlook for
1995 and a good pre-tax profit record in 1994. <BR>
<BR>
The Czech Republic's privatization programme was initiated in 1992, and
alongside that programme came a policy of rapid liberalization. Unlike in
Hungary, foreign banks were allowed to open branch offices in the country
as early as 1992. With so many smaller commercial banks, however, the Czech
Republic is widely considered to be overbanked, and as a result, the central
bank has clamped down on issuing new banking licences. Three banks have
collapsed since 1993, but they were set up at a time when licencing requirements
were considerably more lax than is the case now. Czech financial institutions
are in a better situation than they were as little as two years ago. Nonetheless,
analysts estimate that a further $1 billion in support for the system as
a whole may be necessary to help banks improve their balance sheets. <BR>
<BR>
In Poland, the state has been relatively more hands off in terms of propping
up the banking system and state support for consolidation has been limited
in comparison with the Czech Republic and Hungary. That decentralized approach
to the banking sector may now be changing, however. One aspect of the consolidation
plan currently being implemented by the Polish government on the fragmented
banking sector is driven by the desire to concentrate state-owned banking
assets into four main banking groups from the &quot;Big Nine&quot; in operation
last year. At the heart of this will be the two giants Bank Handlowy w Warszawie,
the trade-related bank that is also Polands largest bank, and Bank Pekoe
SA, both of which may be partially privatized over the next two years. Meanwhile,
the largest state savings bank, PKO BP and BGZ (Bank Gospodarki Zywnosciowej),
the food economy bank which groups together 1600 cooperative banks, will
be likely to remain in the state's hands for some time to come. Consolidation
within smaller banks is likely to continue, and foreign banks in particular
will be instrumental in this, especially as foreign competition is restricted
by the fact that the central bank will not give new banking licences unless
the foreign bank buys smaller troubled banks. A recent trend has been for
overseas investors, such as GECC and General Motors, to take the opportunity
of acquiring banks as a way of supporting their sales in Poland. Ford and
Daewoo are also seen likely to support their car sales in the country in
the same way. By 1999 local banks will have to face the additional competition
from abroad as the sector becomes fully liberalized. <BR>
<BR>
For those banks that have survived 1993 and 1994, the outlook is generally
more positive. Most banks that were in trouble have already received additional
capital to deal with their problems, and special laws were created to encourage
banks to restructure their debts. Polish banks have tapped into the retail
credit market very effectively, and in the first two months of 1996 alone,
retail lending grew by around 8%. While the corporate credit market is not
considered to be as safe, Polish banks have been at an advantage in infrastructure-related
loans for large projects. <BR>
<BR>
Banking reforms in Estonia have also been radical and have been undertaken
with an eye to conforming to EU standards by the turn of the century. Minimum
reserve and capital requirements imposed by the central bank have had dramatic
effects on Estonia's banking system and the resultant mergers and bankruptcies
have brought down the number of banks to 15 at the beginning of this year
from the 42 commercial banks in existence three years earlier. The entire
banking sector has assets approaching $1.3 billion. The five largest banks,
Hansabank, Estonian Savings Bank, Union Bank of Estonia, North Estonian
Bank and the Bank of Tallinn now control three-quarters of the local banking
market. Several of the larger banks have already attracted international
capital through GDR issues last year. <BR>
<BR>
Reforms to the banking structure of other central European economies are
generally less advanced. In Bulgaria, for instance, banking reforms have
been at the leading edge of reforms to the economy but progress is still
limited. Control of the central bank was transferred to Parliament at a
very early stage after the fall of communism, and it was given the responsibility
of managing financial stability and conducting exchange rate policy. The
Bank Consolidation Company was set up in 1992 and took control of all state
banking assets. Consolidation within the segmented state bank sector resulted
in over 20 small state banks being brought under the same roof as the United
Bulgarian Bank in 1993. Banks created after the fall of communism still
have many problems, most notably the legacy of bad debts from the communist
era, estimated to be around $3 billion. Private commercial banks do not
yet play a significant role (there were 28 such private banks in the local
market last year), many are still unsophisticated and direct investment
and participation from abroad is still limited. Most commercial banks have
had little contact with banks from abroad, and many are members of the Commercial
Banking Association, which does not permit foreign membership. Even so,
a privatization programme is planned, and several incentives for investors
such as tax allowances are under discussion. <BR>
<BR>
In the guide which follows, structural changes to the banking sectors of
the countries of central Europe are analyzed in depth. In addition, the
bond markets of the Slovak Republic and Russia are scrutinized with an eye
to foreign investor participation. <BR>

<H3>A special report by ING Bank Eurasia </H3>
<H2>RUSSIA</H2>
<H3>FIXED-INCOME INSTRUMENTS </H3>
Both rouble and dollar-denominated fixed-income instruments have been enjoying
increasing attention from Russian and foreign investors alike. The main
fixed-income instruments and markets and the practical elements are outlined
below. 
<H3>ROUBLE BONDS </H3>
GKOs are rouble bonds issued by the Russian state with maturities of three
and six months sold at a discount. The market for GKOs has been in existence
since May 1993. Longer-term federal loan bonds with tenors of between one
and three years are issued at variable rates and are called OFZs. <BR>
<BR>
In mid-March there were around $18 billion worth of GKOs and OFZs in circulation.
The majority of rouble bonds outstanding, 63% at the end of 1995, are GKOs
issued with maturities of three months, with six-month GKOs making up 21%
of the market. The remaining 21% of the local currency bond market is accounted
for by OFZ bonds. <BR>
<BR>
GKO bonds have appealed to investors because of their relatively high yields
compared with the limited devaluation in the rouble over the past 12 months.
A combination of the slowdown in the rate of inflation (prices rose 4% in
the month of January, down from 4.1% in December) and the effective management
of the rouble by the monetary authorities contributed to investor interest,
though yields have shown a downward trend. Yields have fallen to 50% in
mid-March from the 200% prevailing at the beginning of the year. However,
GKOs are volatile and yields can swing widely. <BR>
<BR>
The outlook for GKOs is seen by the market as being favourable given the
trust that is being placed in the maintenance of the rouble corridor by
the Russian monetary authorities. The potential downside for the rouble
is also limited by the fact that foreign exchange reserves are relatively
buoyant. <BR>
<BR>
Even with the risk of rouble depreciation, investors can hedge exposure
to the local currency by selling roubles forward. This possibility also
exists for foreign investors via their &quot;I&quot; accounts. These are
rouble accounts that can be opened by investors with Russian banks such
as ING Bank Eurasia. &quot;I&quot; accounts can be used for investments
in a selective number of securities. Forward rates are typically based on
an interest rate differential of between 20% and 30% a year and the market
is fairly liquid for tenors of up to three months. Excellent returns are
still achievable for those investors with confidence in the outlook for
the rouble, access to the right instrument and trust in the regions with
which they are doing business. <BR>
<BR>
However, GKOs are typically used to finance the state budget deficit and
in the run-up to June's presidential elections bigger volumes of supply
are expected to come to auction as the government has decided to pay wages
in arrears. This fear of increased supply and political risk from the elections
is likely to remain one of the most important factors keeping a floor on
yields for the next quarter. 
<H3>DOLLAR-DENOMINATED BONDS </H3>
Ministry of Finance (MinFin) bonds are dollar-denominated bonds issued on
May 14 1993 as a result of a freeze on dollar deposits placed with Vnesheconombank
in 1991. Four tranches of MinFin bonds with a total value of $7 billion
are outstanding. Since their issuance, an increasingly liquid market in
MinFin bonds has developed because they are easy to access, they can be
used as collateral or in repo transactions and forwards and options and
they do have relatively attractive yields. <BR>
<BR>
Strategies involving straddles (selling put and calls on tranches III and
IV, the most volatile tranches), spread trading (long one tranche and short
another), and portfolio diversification between tranches can all be employed.
<BR>
<BR>
While MinFin bonds carry less spectacular yields than do GKOs, yielding
between 14% and 17% in mid-March 1996, MinFin bond yields have been falling
because of the positive developments in Russia's economy. They are subject
to similar influences on their yields as GKOs such as domestic political
factors, economic factors and the fact that Russia is an emerging market.
<BR>
<BR>
However, there is also the addition of risk from players' perceptions of
the market's infrastructure, for instance, the acceptance of Vneshtorgbank
as a custodian and the threat of potential dilution (the Ministry of Finance
has the potential to issue a further $1.5 billion into tranche V and an
equivalent sum into a sixth tranche). 
<H3>SECONDARY MARKET </H3>
GKOs can be freely bought and sold by Russian legal entities and private
individuals and any income generated from GKOs is exempt from tax. Foreign
investors that are not legal entities in Russia find it difficult to participate
in the GKO market, however, and less than 5% of the GKO market is held by
foreigners. To date, the only way of investing in short-term bonds is via
agents of the Russian central bank outside Russia. <BR>
<BR>
In contrast, Russian government debt with maturities in excess of one year
can be bought by foreign investors if they open a rouble &quot;I&quot; account
with a Russian bank. Primary auctions for GKOs take place every Wednesday,
the amount and tenor of each auction is announced a week in advance by Micex.
<BR>
<BR>
There are two types of bid applications within the primary auction; competitive
and non-competitive. Micex reveals the limitations on non-competitive bids
at the same time it announces the auction details. 
<H3>TRADING AND SETTLEMENT </H3>
The distinguishing feature of the GKO market is that the bonds are not traded
over the counter and they are settled in roubles. Between $350 million and
$500 million in GKOs are traded every day on the Moscow Interbank Currency
Exchange (Micex), the only bond trading exchange. Registered investors can
only trade GKOs on Micex via the system of primary dealers which includes
ING Bank Eurasia. <BR>
<BR>
Secondary market trading is on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays
between 11:00 and 13:00 local time. GKOs are in book entry form with Micex
as custodian and settlement is T-1 for buying and T+1 for selling. There
are no derivatives yet available on GKOs. <BR>
<BR>
MinFin bonds, meanwhile, are bearer bonds and cannot be taken out of Russia,
though they can be traded outside Russia while a custodian bank keeps the
bonds. Vneshtorgbank in Moscow is the main custodian for MinFin bonds. Between
$150 million and $200 million MinFin bonds are traded OTC each day in a
market that is open 24-hours. <BR>
<BR>
As there are no restrictions for non-resident participants, foreign players
are very active in the MinFin market, making up around half of the market
holdings. Settlement is T+7 calendar days. <BR>
<BR>
Unlike GKOs, MinFin bonds can be used in repo transactions and can be lent
or borrowed on, they also have collateral value. Forwards and options can
also be traded on MinFin bonds. 
<H3>ROUBLE PROMISSORY NOTES </H3>
Promissory notes, known as Veksel in the local market, are sold by a very
limited number of Russian legal entities, such as ING Bank Eurasia. They
can be denominated both in roubles and dollars and can be bought freely
either by foreign parties with an &quot;I&quot; account with a local bank
or by Russian entities. <BR>
<BR>
Promissory notes have terms which vary between three days and one year.
Although the promissory note has a similar function to a bank deposit, it
has several advantages over deposits and other money market instruments,
such as the fact it can be redeemed for cash roubles and there are full
re-endorsement rights. <BR>
<BR>
Promissory notes have the advantage over GKOs in that they can be used as
repo instruments or as collateral. They also mitigate the disadvantages
of GKOs as gains can be repatriated and they do not have as many restrictions
of refinancing, as long as proper credit risks can be found. Interest on
rouble promissory notes is lower than on Russian bonds as they are subject
to 15% withholding tax if bought by a non-banking institution (18% for banks).
This tax on interest bearing promissory notes is substantially less than
tax on interest earned through bank deposits. <BR>
<BR>
There is also a reserve requirement effect on promissory notes. Foreign
currency promissory notes are subject to a 1.5% reserve requirement and
rouble notes reserve requirements vary between 10% and 20% of principal
depending on the term of maturity. <HR><B>MinFin bonds outstanding</B> <TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=1>

Spain still worethe &quot;emerging market&quot; label as late as 1988; the public debt marketsdid not offer any satisfactory liquidity in periods beyond three years whenthe withholding tax for non-residents was abolished in 1991. In the followingthree years, the Spanish bond market was able to offer a wide range of liquidinstruments in all maturities from six months to 15 years and also developeda series of reliable hedging instruments (futures and derivatives). <BR><BR>The question remains whether this spectacular rate of development will survivethe changing trends in the fixed-income markets if interest rates rise throughoutEurope? There are strong reasons to believe that the fixed-income marketrally of the last three years, which allowed such rapid developments, hasenabled Spain to join the &quot;modern markets&quot; club. <BR><BR>The first signs of change came with the announcement in late 1990 that thewithholding tax for non-residents would be abolished, as from the January1 1991. That set off a chain reaction. Strong expectations of interest ratefalls in Spain and a record period of peseta stability - the pesetaspent the best part of two years at the top of the former EMS currency grid,which required constant interventions by the Bank of Spain in the sterling/pesetato control the situation - drove non-resident money into Spain. <BR><BR>The proportion of total public debt in the hands of non-residents jumpedfrom 27% in early 1991 to more than 34% two years later, and to more than40% if the speculative buying by hedge funds, especially during 1993, isincluded. The Spanish treasury, in order to be able to respond to such anincrease in demand, began to adapt its auction rhythm in late 1991 by issuing10-year paper once a month instead of once every two months. At the sametime, the Spanish monetary authorities, realizing that non-resident inflowswould not last forever, decided to encourage stronger domestic demand. Somefiscal advantages were implemented to promote the new <I>fondos de inversion</I>(mutual funds which also offer low fees), which started to capture domesticsavings, thus increasing institutional investors' already strong appetitefor Spanish treasury bonds. Today, these mutual funds represent Pta13 trillionworth of bonds, ie 40% of total government debt. This has proven to be agreat success as the treasury is now guaranteed to channel its debt throughthese type of funds. The recent launch of another type of fondos de inversioncalled fondos garantizados should also increase investors' appetite. <BR><BR>The chain reaction continued: in a bullish market of this kind, the bulkof demand moved to the long end of the curve, which made it essential tocreate appropriate hedging instruments to assist the domestic banks in theirmarket-making role and, furthermore, enable them to stand up to their London-basedcompetitors. In late 1991, and shortly after the introduction of three-and five-year futures contracts which are no longer traded, the 10-yearfutures contract was born. In addition, the need for short-term hedginginstruments resulted in the creation of the three-month Mibor-90 and one-yearMibor-360 contracts. All this was met with overwhelming success. Not onlywas the Spanish bond market responding better than expected to the surprisinglystrong worldwide demand, but it also caused the Spanish treasury to intensifyits auction programme, issuing regular and sizeable amounts in various maturities.During 1991 and early 1992, before the Danish rejection of the Maastrichttreaty, the average amount issued was approximately Pta1 trillion per monthin letras (T-bills) and around Pta500 billion per month in bonos, up tofive years, and obligaciones, up to 10 years. This was about twice the averagemonthly amount issued prior to this period. As a direct result of this increasedliquidity and the wider range of hedging instruments available, Spanishmarket-makers became accustomed to quoting for larger amounts. Also, thetreasury started issuing 10-year paper on a regular basis. The climax ofthis rapid development was reached in December 1993 with the launch of anew 15-year bond, which was the treasury's most notable response to thegrowth in demand for long-term paper and at the same time provided themwith another opportunity to lengthen the duration of its debt. <BR><BR>In little more than three years, Spain had managed to turn an emerging bondmarket into a mature, reliable and professional one. But after the firstthunderblast of the rise in US interest rates signalled in February 1994,global bond markets started to shake and the &quot;high-yielders&quot; tumbled.<BR><BR>Although the Spanish treasury had quickly seen the importance of developinga domestic market in order to counterbalance the excessive weight of non-residentholding of public debt, the amount issued on long-term maturities to respondto such aggressive non-resident demand was much more than natural 10-yearSpanish buyers would ever be able to absorb. The Bund/bono 10-year benchmarkyield spread reached a low of 200bp by the end of 1993, having reached anall-time high during the Maastricht crisis of 650bp. Spanish institutionallong-term investors, in the form of pension funds and insurance companies,were hardly able to absorb more than 11% of the amount issued in 1993 inthe 10-year and 15-year maturities. The rest was distributed among non-residentinvestors and resident mutual funds. This meant that in the case of a changingmarket, 85% of the long-term paper issued in 1993 (mainly in hands of internationalspeculators), such as hedge funds, could be immediately sold, only findingreasonable support with an additional and substantial risk premium. Thecorrection in the US market and its effects on Europe served to highlightthe fragility of this still young market. <BR><BR>The euphoria had reached such a high level during the &quot;one-way year&quot;of 1993 that investors in the Spanish market were under the false illusionthat the market was firmly established with the basis of a reliable, strongand powerful primary dealership framework. The real situation was different.The treasury and the Bank of Spain, although officially requiring the 12primary dealers to guarantee the liquidity of all the references of theyield curve, always tolerated a certain flexibility in this respect. Atthe first signs of a change in trend (March 1994), the quotation spreadsuddenly widened, and the liquidity on the 10-year futures contract decreasedsubstantially, and consequently so did that of the 10-year cash bonds. Ittook only three months to transform the Spanish curve, with more than 15different cash securities covering all maturities from one to 15 years,into a simplified curve where only reduced liquidity could be found forthree main areas: the three-year, five-year and 10-year benchmarks. <BR><BR>At the beginning of each year, the treasury announces its overall fundingrequirements, as set out in the official state budget, but it is not obligedto provide a strict timetable of its financing programme and is thereforeat liberty to choose the timing, pricing, size and currency of its issues.Indeed, since February 1994 and during the first half of 1995, the Spanishtreasury returned to using six-month and one-year T-bills leaving most ofthe bond auctions deserted. But since the second half of 1995, the treasurycommitted itself to issue bonds at the monthly auctions and introduced somepositive change with its financing programme after realizing that only throughregular bond auctions would it be able to attract investors and projecta more serious image. Every Friday prior to the bond auction, the treasury(after meeting the primary dealers) sets a minimum, maximum and desiredamount to issue in the three- and 10-year bonds (together) and in the five-and 15-year bonds (also together). Although the minimum amounts for eachthree-, five- and 10-year are Pta30 billion and Pta15 billion for the 15-year,the Spanish treasury has always issued what they have announced as theirdesired issuing amount. This guarantees that market participants can alwaysshort the bonds prior to the auction, thereby giving more liquidity anddynamism to the market. <H3>ECONOMIC OVERVIEW </H3>The recent improvements in its economic fundamentals are an indication thatSpain is well on its way to shedding its &quot;high-yielder&quot; label.<BR><BR>The commitment of the socialist government to meet convergence criteriaby 1999 has proved, if not yet successful, at least very encouraging. Budgetdeficit has dropped from 6.7% to 5.8% and is expected to drop close to 4.5%in 1996. For the first time in several years, inflation has dropped significantlyto reach 3.9% by January 1996 and should stabilize at around 3.5% this currentyear. The structural reforms implemented in the past to reduce social spendingwill be reinforced, together with some changes in the service sector. Hence,the peseta has gained stability against all major crosses and the spreadwith bonos has been reduced from 525bp in the beginning of 1995 to 320bptoday. <BR><BR>The uncertainty regarding general elections should not weigh too negativelyas the right wing PP will almost certainly be the winner with either anabsolute majority as suggested by the latest polls or at least a possiblecoalition with minor regional parties (including Catalan Ciu). Also investorshave suffered from socialist party corruption scandals throughout 1995.A change of government should be viewed as a positive factor for stabilizingthe political atmosphere. Finally, the PP has shown through its programmean even more austere attitude as regards to spending and as much commitmentto the monetary union as the socialist party. <BR><BR>Hence, the opening of the Spanish market is not only an undeniable factbut it is also a firmly established and on-going process. After abolishingthe withholding tax for non-residents, foreign exchange controls were rescindedin 1992 and the cut in reserve requirements to 2% (from 17% in 1989 and5% in 1991) reduced the difference between the Europe and domestic Pesetainterest rates to almost zero. <BR><BR>Special efforts were made by the international clearing systems, Euroclearand Cedel, to simplify the settlements procedures. The MEFF (Mercado Espanolde Futuros Financieros) daily average volume now reaches 60,000 contracts,which is still far from the 150,000 MATIF daily average with the same underlyingnominal amount, but represents twice as much as the 1993 average of 27,000contracts a day. <BR><BR>The development of the Spanish bond market will be slower from now on, althoughit is still catching up with the more sophisticated markets. The optionmarket is still far from being liquid and the strips market is non-existent.Also, the market still lacks a very long bond (30 year), while variable-rateinstruments have never been successful and the corporate bonds market maintainsits interest generally only in the primary market. <BR><BR>Nevertheless, what has been achieved so far in Spain is a solid basis uponwhich the financial authorities can continue to build a more efficient bondmarket. As time goes by and with the assistance of the fast-developing derivativessector, the bond market will soon offer the diversified investment and arbitrageopportunities found in more modern bond markets. <H3>MARKET STRUCTURE </H3>Outstanding government debt is approximately Pta32 trillion at February1996 with <I>bonos del estado</I> and <I>obligaciones del estado</I> issuescontributing significantly to this figure (60%). Bonos (three- and five-yearmaturities) and obligaciones (10- and 15-year maturities) have outstandingamounts of Pta500 billion to Pta1 trillion, but are regularly re-openedto around Pta1 trillion. The typical denomination is Pta10,000. <BR><BR>Spanish bonds are issued in book-entry form. About 40% of transactions areexecuted through a system of inter-dealer brokers instituted by the Bankof Spain. Minimum quotes on this system are for Pta100 million. The MadridStock Exchange does list bonds but the volume traded on it is negligible.Bonos are non-callable with bullet maturities while obligaciones are nolonger issued with put and call features. Bonds trade on a clean-price basisand there are no commissions or transaction costs. There is no tax on foreignersinvesting in bonds, except for residents of the 48 'tax havens' identifiedby the Bank of Spain. Issuance is through monthly auction, even for the15-year bonds which were auctioned every two months up until 1994. Three-and 10-year paper bids are submitted before 10:30 am on every first Tuesdayof the month whereas five- and 15-year is every first Wednesday of the month.Results are announced the same day around 12:30pm. Payment is two weekslater. <BR><BR>Settlement through Euroclear and Cedel, with recent improvements can takethree days while domestic settlement is still seven days. Settlement isdone on a delivery-versus-payment basis for all transactions between interbankmarket participants. Interest payment is on an annual or semi-annual basis,depending on the bond. Since March 1989, all new issues have carried annualcoupons. Interest accrues from the previous coupon (inclusive) to the settlementdate (exclusive), so value date equals the settlement date. Yield is calculatedon an actual/365-year basis, using ISMA, although a special modificationis used for bonds prior to their nominated date. <HR><BR><B>Bonds team</B> <BR><BR><B>Sales</B> <BR><BR>Patrick Daries, Pablo Llad&oacute;, <BR><BR>Mar&iacute;a Guzm&aacute;n, Patricia Martinez <BR><BR><B>Trading </B><BR><BR>Nicolas Linares, Jes&uacute;s Bartolom&eacute;, <BR><BR>Jose Angel Zabalegui <BR><BR>Tel: 34-1 432-7808 <BR><BR>Fax: 34-1-432-7503 <BR><BR>Reuter Code: ISMD, ISME <p></td></tr></table><br><nobr><a href="em.96.03.26.index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Back a Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt1.gif" alt="Back"></a><a href="../../../../../services/faqs.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Help';return true"><img width=22 height=22 hspace=90 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt2.gif" alt="Help"></a><a href="#top" onMouseOver="window.status='Top of the Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt3.gif" alt="Top"></a></nobr><br><br><nobr><a href="../../../../../alert/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='ALERT - Discussion Groups, Latest News, Site Updates, Sponsors and Events Diary';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav1.gif" alt="Alert"></a><a href="../../../../../search/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SEARCH - Keyword and Structured Searches';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav2.gif" alt="Search"></a><a href="../../../../../services/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SERVICES - FAQs, Feedback, Problems and EMWL Team';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav3.gif" alt="Services"></a><a href="../../../../../contents/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='CONTENTS - Publications, World Map, Product Sections and Data';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav44.gif" alt="Contents"></a></nobr></font><br><br><font size=2>All material subject to strictly enforced copyright laws. 1996&copy; <a href="MAILTO:pbrady@pobox.com">Euromoney Publications PLC.</a></font><br></center></body></html>

All through the currencyturmoil of the period between 1992 and 1993, Spain resisted leaving theERM and has maintained its wide 6% bands around a central Ecu parity, althoughthat parity has been devalued on four occasions since Spain joined the ERM.<BR><BR>Historically, the exchange rate has been dominated by periods of overvaluation.These happened after restrictive monetary policy designed to weigh downon inflation has sucked flows of short-term capital into the country. Thatwas certainly evident in the early 1990s when the peseta sat at the topof the ERM and market players, convinced there would be no adjustment incentral parities prior to monetary union, poured short-term flows into whatthey saw as a one-way bet. In the past, periods of overvaluation and uncompetitivenesshave been followed by devaluation. <BR><BR>There have been four devaluations in the past 15 years: a 7% cut in thevalue of the currency in September 1992 after the UK quit the system andthe lira floated, and a subsequent 6% devaluation in November of the sameyear. This was followed by an 8% devaluation in May 1993 and a 7% devaluationin March last year. The last devaluation was certainly more related to politicalfactors, namely the political scandals in the socialist administration,than to any other specific factors. <BR><BR>The value of the peseta against the Deutschmark has risen considerably sincethat last devaluation, appreciating by as much as 6%. While there has beensome retreat since early in the year, the currency has remained within arange of Pta84/Dm to Pta85/Dm for the first two months of the year. However,whether peseta strength will actually hit Spain's competitiveness is notbecoming an issue this time around. While the peseta is a lot stronger thanit was a year ago, the scandals of a year ago were at their peak and althoughthe peseta has recently been regularly topping the ERM grid, this is temperedby the fact its central parity is considerably lower than it was before.On most measures of purchasing power parity, the peseta is correctly valued.(Estimates vary on PPP between around Pta83/Dm to Pta86/Dm.) <H3>Economic background </H3><B><I>The Maastricht criteria</I></B> <BR><BR>As yet, Spain has not met any of the Maastricht criteria for eligibilityto become part of any monetary union. <BR><BR>One of the biggest hindrances has been the budget deficit, which has averaged6.6% of GDP since 1993. In 1995 the budget shortfall was almost double theproportion of GDP (3%) specified by the treaty. The targeted 4.4% of GDPfor the budget deficit doesn't look unrealistic, whichever party wins theelections on March 3. <BR><BR>Debt was 64.9% of GDP at the end of November 1995, and has been climbing.Around 50% of debt is made up of three-year and five-year government bonds(bonos), 30% in short-term treasury bills and 20% in foreign currency andother accounts. Of the key components of debt, by far the largest is thatof public debt, which rose 10.4% to Pta45.38 trillion in the first 11 monthsof 1995 against the same period in 1994. The debt of the 17 regional administrationsclimbed by 7.5% to Pta7.3 trillion in the same period, while central governmentdebt rose 11% to Pta3.77 trillion. <BR><BR><B><I>Inflation</I></B> <BR><BR>Economic growth is likely to remain subdued, a factor that has contributedto Spain's success in reigning in inflation. Inflation has been one extremelypositive factor for the currency, and Spain, in line with other westernEuropean economies, has been reaping the benefits of a benign inflationaryoutlook. In January, consumer price inflation slowed to 3.9%, the lowestannual rise since April 1988. The Bank of Spain is forecasting inflationwill remain in a 3.5% to 4% range in the first quarter of 1996, and thebottom end of that range looks achievable by the end of 1996. Underlyinginflation, which has been stubbornly high over the past year, is showingsigns of slowing, a factor which suggests the slowing inflation rate isnot just a result of lower food and energy prices and last year's valueadded taxation falling out of the index. This underscores the view Spainmay at last have made a breakthrough into a new era of lower inflation.<BR><BR>Wage growth has been muted, making a lower-than-expected contribution toinflation, and high levels of unemployment are likely to continue weighingdown on wages. The first collective wage agreement of 1996, for the bankingsector, secured a nominal rise in wages of 3.5%, falling to 3% next yearand 2.75% in 1998. Other sectors are likely to follow suit. Even so, forthe Bank of Spain to achieve its longer term official forecasts of inflationat only 3% in 1997, it will need to keep a tight grip on monetary policy.<BR><BR><B><I>Unemployment</I></B> <BR><BR>Spain's unemployment problem remains thorny. Rigidity in Spain's labourlaws has been blamed at least in part for the fact that 22.7% of the labourforce is jobless. If the centre-right Partido Popular does gain power afterthe elections it will be faced with the problem of balancing the need tocut Spain's budget deficit and the need to introduce measures to cut unemploymentin order to maintain its popularity. <BR><BR><B><I>Current account</I></B> <BR><BR>Spain's current account position has performed well in 1995, with the currentaccount of the balance of payments actually in surplus by 1.3% of GDP. However,much of this is technical because of Spain's net over-payments to the EU.When these were repaid, they added a massive Pta2 trillion to the country'sreceipts. Even so, the deficit for 1996 is unlikely to be very large, andat a likely 0.5% of GDP will mark a better trend than ever before. <BR><BR>The successive cuts in the value of the peseta since 1992 have helped Spain'strade position, and were an engine for growth. With the economic slowdown,however, export growth has slowed more rapidly than that of imports. Thetrade shortfall in 1995 as a whole widened by over 13% to Pta2.895 trillion.However, the trade deficit has been compensated for by current account flowsassociated with tourism, which plays a very important role in Spain's economy.The trade gap is likely to continue widening for the next six months, untilimports begin reacting more strongly to the slowdown. <H3>Risks for the exchange rate </H3><B><I>Political risk</I></B> <BR><BR>There are two medium-term sources of political risk for the peseta, bothof which emanate from March's elections. The first is if the centre-rightPartido Popular (PP), widely tipped to take power from the ruling socialists,does not achieve an outright majority. For outright control of the governmentthey need 176 seats in the chamber, but anything between 169 and 172 seatsshould secure them control. If they do achieve this it will be peseta supportive.Anything below 160 seats may be more unsettling for the currency as thePP will have to negotiate to form a government. <BR><BR>The second source of risk comes after the new administration comes intopower. In order to retain the confidence of the markets, it will need tohave begun delivering on some of its promises to cut the budget deficitand the public debt within its first 18 months in office. The PP has announcedstrict austerity measures but its manifesto hinges on its ability to spendless through more efficient public administration and privatization. Itis relying on the fact that if it creates the right environment, privatesector initiatives will spring up to boost economic growth. It is also dependenton raising the tax take while cutting tax rates. Its task will be made evenmore difficult if it does not achieve a working majority. <BR><BR>At present, the 1996 budget is merely a rollover of last year's budget,adopted by fast-track decree law. The new administration may decide to havea mini-budget, which would be the first real indication of its stance. <BR><BR><B><I>Yield curve</I></B> <BR><BR>Spain's yield curve has regularly been steeply positive, especially betweentwo-year and 10-year securities as the country is a net debtor to the financialmarkets. The shape of the curve from the overnight area to one-year mayvary depending on how restrictive the central bank is being at any one time.Recently the Bank of Spain has been keeping liquidity tight and interestrates at the very short end, of the money market high. Around Pta9.5 trillionof bonds are being funded through the forex forward market, and that waskeeping overnight rates above 9% in late February. <BR><BR>Most of the demand by Spanish corporations is centred around the very shortend of the curve, around three months, and is for variable rate instrumentsbecause of past interest rate volatility in the Spanish market. In addition,95% of individual loans (for mortgages) are for one-year floating-rate instruments.<BR><BR><B><I>Bond market risks</I></B> <BR><BR>One of the main driving forces of the currency market over the past fewmonths has been the bond market. This has been broadly peseta supportivesince November last year. With the likelihood of further downside for shortterm interest rates, the yield curve is likely to steepen further as investorsswitch shorter to take advantage of the move. In mid-February the slopeof the curve was around 100bp between two and 10 years. However, a significantnarrowing in spreads between bonos and Bunds through the 300bp area is notlikely over the medium term as Spain's participation in the first stageof European monetary union is uncertain. The gap between 10-year Bunds andbonos was 340bp in mid-February. <BR><BR>A big sell-off in European bond markets does remain one of the most significantthreats to the peseta, however. This could come with doubts that the Bundesbankwill cut rates further, forcing other European economies to reassess theirrate-cutting strategies. Political risks, particularly the worries aboutcutting the budget deficit, may also hurt the bond market. This promptedStandard and Poor's, the international credit rating agency, to lower itsoutlook for long-term foreign currency debt to stable from positive in February.<H3>Role of the central bank </H3><B><I>Independence assured</I></B> <BR><BR>The Bank of Spain gained its official independence in June 1994, which becameeffective at the beginning of the following year. It was given the mandateto pursue price stability, following the role model of the Bundesbank. Themain role of the Bank of Spain, apart from maintaining the smooth functioningof the financial markets and monitoring financial institutions, is to achievepublicly published inflation targets. This target range is currently between3.5% and 4%. The central bank also has the responsibility for managing thegovernment's exchange rate policy, which is explicitly geared around stayingin the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system. To thatend, the Bank of Spain has unpublished goals for the exchange rate. Thesevary throughout the year, but the central bank is believed to be quite strictin maintaining the peseta's ranges. Rather than having the exchange rateas a policy tool with which to manipulate the economy, as was the case indays before joining the ERM, the central bank has control over monetarypolicy. The Bank of Spain watches the French franc and the Deutschmark particularlyclosely as these two currencies form Spain's main trading partners. <BR><BR>Given the express target of staying in the ERM, the central bank was forcedto devalue the peseta in March 1995 after it no longer had enough ammunitionin terms of foreign exchange reserves to defend the currency during thepolitical credibility crisis. <BR><BR>The central bank has since won back a lot of its face lost after the devaluation.In early 1995 when the market perceived that the Bank of Spain was raisinginterest rates to defend the peseta, the market reacted by increasing currencysales. By contrast, after the municipal elections in May, the last ratehike in Spain actually enhanced the prestige of the central bank as it wasseen as an anti-inflationary move at a time when the peseta was stable.<BR><BR>Subsequently, the central bank has been very cautious in trimming rates,and has not always followed suit when the German Bundesbank cut its keyrates. The 10-day repo tender is the main instrument through which the Bankof Spain influences monetary policy. It has only made two cuts in this keyrate since May, of 25 basis points apiece, the first in late December 1995and the second in mid-January. This circumspection is paying off as notonly has it been supportive for the currency, but also the Bank of Spainhas now got plenty of leeway to cut key repo rates from their current 8.75%.<BR><BR>Last year the central bank spent considerable sums defending the currency,but as the peseta has regularly topped the ERM grid this year, the centralbank has used the opportunity of peseta strength to replenish its foreignexchange reserves. In January reserves climbed $1.2 billion to $39.44 billion.This gives the central bank a better cushion with which to defend the currencyin the future. <BR><BR>The Bank of Spain is likely to continue its cautious stance. Its independencefrom the ministry of economy is evident, and frequently statements fromthe central bank show it is not towing a party line. Governor Luis AngelRojo has asserted that there should be no relaxation of the Maastricht conditionsand has urged Spain to continue making the adjustments necessary to fulfilthe conditions. <H3>The Forex market </H3><B><I>Market structure</I></B> <BR><BR>The volume of activity on Spain's foreign exchange market has increaseddramatically since the market was deregulated and made fully convertiblein 1992. All operations in foreign currency are deregulated for Spanishresidents and there are no restrictions or withholding tax for foreignerseither in pesetas or in the bond market. <BR><BR>The central bank conducts regular surveys to determine the depth and scopeof activity within the financial markets. It is also a contributor to theBank for International Settlements reports. The Bank of Spain calculatesthat the average daily volume of trading on Madrid's foreign exchange market,net of double counting, was $18.26 billion in April 1995. That marks a 48%rise on the $12.4 billion average daily turnover recorded in April 1992,and a rise of more than 300% on the $4.5 billion average daily turnoverin April 1989. <BR><BR><B><I>Market players</I></B> <BR><BR>Foreign dealers are counterparties in 71% of average daily turnover, a figurethat has remained relatively stable since 1992. Spanish dealers are counterpartiesin 21% of trades, and other financial institutions are counterparties in5% of daily trades. However, this latter group have actually increased theirparticipation from an average $211 million a day in 1992 to $1 billion in1995, an increase of nearly 380% over the period. By contrast, trades withnon-financial clients have actually fallen both in absolute and percentageterms, from $672 million in 1992 to an average $610 billion per day lastApril. <BR><BR><B><I>Instrument composition</I></B> <BR><BR>In April 1995, 96% of all daily trades on an average basis were conductedin the swap or spot market, and only 4% were outright forwards. The swapmarket itself accounted for the lion's share of all trades, having overtakenspot trades in terms of importance on an average daily basis. In April 1995,an average day saw $10.4 billion of swaps change hands, 57% of the marketvolume. That's up from $5.4 billion in 1992 and has risen in proportionfrom 44% of the market volume. By contrast, the spot market had $7.2 billionof trades on an average day, around 39% of daily volume. The spot marketaccounted for over half, 51%, of the average daily volume in 1992. <BR><BR>The role of outright forwards has never been large in the Spanish market,and it is diminishing. Outright forwards comprised only 4% of average dailyvolumes in 1995, down from 5% in 1992. Outright transactions are generallylimited to exporters and importers hedging currency risk and the banks thendiversifying this risk by using instruments on the interbank market. <BR><BR><B><I>Swaps</I></B> <BR><BR>The most active areas of the swap market is at the very short end of thecurve, up to seven days. Swap trades of under seven days made up 56% ofall swaps on an average daily basis in April 1995, up from 51% three yearsearlier. 17% of swap trades were between seven days and one month, and 19%between one month and one year. Only 8% of swap trades in Madrid's foreignexchange market had a due date in excess of one year. <BR><BR><B><I>Interest rate futures and currency options</I></B> <BR><BR>There is an organized market for interest rate futures over the three monthMadrid interbank offered rate (Mibor) and 10-year futures are availableover the cheapest-to-deliver 10-year government bonds. However, standardizedcurrency futures contracts only had a short existence in Spain, with contractson the key currencies withdrawn on MEFF-SA in 1993 as interest was limited.There is a market in currency options, particularly plain vanilla optionson the peseta/dollar and peseta/Deutschmark crosses. Domestic institutionalinvestors are not legally allowed to short the market or use futures orOTC options. Options are frequently traded via offshore banks or subsidiaries,so official figures are not always representative. <BR><BR>There is a potential market for synthetics, but this is on hold as Spanishcompanies still lack the financial understanding and risk management systemsto use them effectively. <BR><BR><B><I>Currency composition</I></B> <BR><BR>In Madrid's currency market around three-quarters of all transactions areagainst the peseta, a figure that has remained stable since liberalization.The most actively-used currency is still the dollar, especially as swapand outright transactions are generally denominated in dollars. In April1995 the dollar was employed in 47% of swap transactions, 33% of forwardsand 25% of spot transactions on an average daily basis according to theBank of Spain. <BR><BR>However, the Deutschmark has become the key currency cross in the spot market,with around 62% of all spot trades involving the Deutschmark, as againstonly 48% in 1992. That, however, is mainly because of the increased importanceof dollar/Deutschmark trading. Even so, the Deutschmark/peseta cross remainsthe most significant commodity traded in the currency spot market, and isthe reference point for other cross rates. <BR><BR><B><I>Transaction size and spreads</I></B> <BR><BR>Trade sizes have been increasing in tandem with the development of the Spanishmarket. While the minimum amount that can be bought or sold on the interbankmarket is $5 million or Dm5 million, the amount traded generally rangesbetween $5 million and $10 million. Bid-offer spreads are similar to othermajor European currencies (Pta124.00-05/$ or Pta84.10-13/Dm). <H3>Currency outlook </H3>The peseta is likely to maintain a holding pattern until the general elections.After then the Bank of Spain will be in a good position to cut interestrates. It will be wary of maintaining too tight a monetary policy if fiscalpolicy is made more lax. The market is discounting key interest rates fallingto around 8% by the end of 1996, and the Bank of Spain may cut rates furtheras long as there is some kind of compromise on a fiscal package by the newadministration. <BR><BR>It will be difficult for the peseta to strengthen decisively beyond Pta83.50/Dmover the next three months as Spain could risk most of its competitive advantagegained by the devaluation last year if it did. In the same period, pesetastrength should be contained by Pta120/$. <BR><BR>Further out, the peseta may weaken along with other currencies in Europeagainst the Deutschmark, especially if there is a new bout of scepticismabout the second tier currencies as EMU approaches. On a one year view,the currency is likely to pull back slightly to Pta85/Dm and Pta132/$ respectively.<HR><BR><B>Pta/$ at end of month, 1995</B> <BR><BR><IMG SRC="images/em.96.03.26.3.1.gif"WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="133" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <HR><BR><B>Commonly watched indicators</B> <TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=1><TR><TD></TD> <TD><I>Indicator</I></TD> <TD></TD> <TD><I>Release date</I></TD></TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>Bank of Spain money market tender</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2>Every10 days</TD> </TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>Consumer Price Index</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2>Monthly,between 13th and 15th depending on holidays</TD> </TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>Unemploymentreport</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2>Monthly, on 10th,11th, or 12th depending on holidays</TD></TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>Trade figures</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2>Monthly, no fixeddate, generally around 20th </TD> </TR><BR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2>Budget deficit</TD> <TD>Monthly</TD> <TD></TD> </TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>Foreignreserves</TD> <TD COLSPAN=2>First five days of the month</TD> </TR> <TR><TD>GDP</TD><TD></TD> <TD>Quarterly</TD> </TR> </TABLE> <HR><BR><B>The peseta since 1991<BR><BR></B><IMG SRC="images/em.96.03.26.3.2.gif"WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="162" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <HR><BR><BR>For further information, contact: <BR><BR><B>Forex Tomas Antona Dealing code: BBVX Tel: +34 1 374 4528</B> <BR><BR><B>BBVT <BR><BR>Derivatives Luis Garcia Dealing code: BBVT Tel: +34 1 374 5107 (swaps) <BR><BR>Tel: +34 1 374 5119 (forex) <BR><BR>Bonds Ignacio del Amo Tel: +34 1 374 5104</B> <p></td></tr></table><br><nobr><a href="em.96.03.26.index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Back a Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt1.gif" alt="Back"></a><a href="../../../../../services/faqs.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Help';return true"><img width=22 height=22 hspace=90 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt2.gif" alt="Help"></a><a href="#top" onMouseOver="window.status='Top of the Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt3.gif" alt="Top"></a></nobr><br><br><nobr><a href="../../../../../alert/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='ALERT - Discussion Groups, Latest News, Site Updates, Sponsors and Events Diary';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav1.gif" alt="Alert"></a><a href="../../../../../search/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SEARCH - Keyword and Structured Searches';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav2.gif" alt="Search"></a><a href="../../../../../services/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SERVICES - FAQs, Feedback, Problems and EMWL Team';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav3.gif" alt="Services"></a><a href="../../../../../contents/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='CONTENTS - Publications, World Map, Product Sections and Data';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav44.gif" alt="Contents"></a></nobr></font><br><br><font size=2>All material subject to strictly enforced copyright laws. 1996&copy; <a href="MAILTO:pbrady@pobox.com">Euromoney Publications PLC.</a></font><br></center></body></html>
