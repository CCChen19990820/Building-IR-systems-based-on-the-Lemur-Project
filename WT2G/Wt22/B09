         approved by the Director of Insurance.

     b)  Credits.

         personal contents in any structure.  (Residential
         Property Insurance).

     c)  Net Participation.

         Net participation is equal to gross participation
         adjusted by voluntary credits.  There shall be no
         maximum applicable to net participation.

     d)  Market Penetration.

         FAIR Plan market penetration shall be based only on
         residential building and contents policies.  Residential
         contents policies will not be considered.

     e)  Credit Eligible Areas (CEA's)

          1)  As of the effective date of this Part Credit

              the Illinois Department of Insurance.

          2)  Beginning in July of 1981 and annually thereafter,
              the Department of  Insurance shall review all
              Credit Eligible Areas and determine which CEA's
              have a FAIR Plan market penetration (FAIR Plan
              policies divided by the total of FAIR Plan policies
              plus voluntary policies) which is 15% or greater.

 
Section 3301.40  Credit Formula
 
     a)  The FAIR Plan shall compute the gross participation for
         all companies as set forth in their formula filed with
         and approved by the Director.

     b)  Beginning with calendar year 1981 and each calendar year
         thereafter, companies shall report to the FAIR Plan on
         or before April 1st of the following year residential
         property insurance written premiums as follows:

          1)  All premiums written in CEA's during the year for
              which the immediate previous writer was the FAIR
              Plan.

          2)  All premiums written in CEA's where the FAIR Plan's
              market penetration exceeds 15% as determined in
              Section 3301.30(e) including new and renewal
              business as defined in (f) below.

     c)  Beginning with calendar year 1981 and each calendar year
         thereafter, the FAIR Plan shall compute residential
         property insurance written premiums written in CEA's by
         the FAIR Plan during the calendar year.  Such
         computation shall be made by April 1st of the subsequent
         year.

     d)  Companies shall receive credit on their participation as
         follows:

          1)  Credit for CEA voluntary written premiums as
              reported in (b)(2) above and determined by the FAIR
              Plan shall be allowed using the formula of 600% of
              Fire, Allied Lines and Homeowners written premiums
              so reported.

          2)  Credit for CEA voluntary written premium as
              determined in (d)(1) above shall be increased an
              additional 600% for that portion in which the
              immediate previous writer was the FAIR Plan.

          3)  A one time credit of 900% shall be allowed for
              voluntary written premiums on risks located in a
              CEA where the immediate past writer was the FAIR
              Plan and the risk does not otherwise qualify for
              credit under (d)(2) above.

     e)  The minimum level of net participation for each company
         shall be 50% of its  gross participation.

     f)  Only new policies on risks written on or after January
         1, 1981, or renewal policies which were first written by
         the company claiming the credit on or after January 1,
         1981, shall be considered for any credit.  A policy will
         not be considered a new policy for purposes of claiming
         a credit if the immediate previous writer was a company
         affiliated with the new company on the risk.

 
Section 3301.50  Severability Provision
 
If any Section or portion of a Section of this Part or the
applicability thereof to any person or circumstances is held
invalid by a court, the remainder of the Part or the
applicability of such provision to other persons or circumstances
shall not be affected thereby.

Section 3401.ILLUSTRATION A  Disclaimer and Summary Document
 
                                 ILLINOIS
                    LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE GUARANTY
                              ASSOCIATION LAW

    Residents of Illinois who purchase health insurance, life insurance,
and annuities should know that the insurance companies licensed in Illinois
to write these types of insurance are members of the Illinois Life and
Health Insurance Guaranty Association.  The purpose of this Guaranty
Association is to assure that policyholders will be protected, within
limits, in the unlikely event that a member insurer becomes financially
unable to meet its policy obligations.  If this should happen, the Guaranty
Association will assess its other member insurance companies for the money
to pay the covered claims of policyholders that live in Illinois (and their
payees, beneficiaries, and assignees) and, in some cases, to keep coverage
in force.  The valuable extra protection provided by these insurers through
the Guaranty Association is not unlimited, however, as noted below.

                             ILLINOIS LIFE AND
                   HEALTH INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION
                                DISCLAIMER

               The Illinois Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association
         provides coverage of claims under some types of policies if the
         insurer becomes impaired or insolvent.  COVERAGE MAY NOT BE
         AVAILABLE FOR YOUR POLICY.  Even if coverage is provided, there
         are substantial limitations and exclusions.  Coverage is generally
         conditioned on continued residence in Illinois.  Other conditions
         may also preclude coverage.

               You should not rely on availability of coverage under the
         Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Law when selecting
         an insurer.  Your insurer and agent are prohibited by law from
         using the existence of the Association or its coverage to sell you
         an insurance policy.

               The Illinois Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association
         or the Illinois Department of Insurance will respond to any
         questions you may have which are not answered by this document.
         Policyholders with additional questions may contact:

                      Summary of General Purposes And
                      Current Limitations of Coverage

    The Illinois law that provides for this safety-net coverage is called
the Illinois Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Law ("Law")
[215 ILCS 5/531.01, et seq.].  The following contains a brief summary of
the Law's coverages, exclusions, and limits.  This summary does not cover
all provisions, nor does it in any way change anyone's rights or
obligations under the Law or the rights or obligations of the Guaranty
Association.  If you have obtained this document from an agent in
connection with the purchase of a policy, you should be aware that its
delivery to you does not guarantee that your policy is covered by the
Guaranty Association.

     a)  Coverage:

               The Illinois Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association
         provides coverage to policyholders that reside in Illinois for
         insurance issued by members of the Guaranty Association,
         including:

          1)  life insurance, health insurance, and annuity contracts;

          2)  life, health or annuity certificates under direct group
              policies or contracts;

          3)  unallocated annuity contracts; and

          4)  contracts to furnish health care services and subscription
              certificates for medical or health care services issued by
              certain licensed entities.  The beneficiaries, payees, or
              assignees of such persons are also protected, even if they
              live in another state.

     b)  Exclusions from Coverage:

          1)  The Guaranty Association does not provide coverage for:

               A)  any policy or portion of a policy for which the
                   individual has assumed the risk;

               B)  any policy of reinsurance (unless an assumption
                   certificate was issued);

               C)  interest rate guarantees which exceed certain statutory
                   limitations;

               D)  certain unallocated annuity contracts issued to an
                   employee benefit plan protected under the Pension
                   Benefit Guaranty Corporation and any portion of a
                   contract which is not issued to or in connection with a
                   specific employee, union or association of natural
                   persons benefit plan or a government lottery;

               E)  any portion of a variable life insurance or variable
                   annuity contract not guaranteed by an insurer; or

               F)  any stop loss insurance.

          2)  In addition, persons are not protected by the Guaranty
              Association if:

               A)  the Illinois Director of Insurance determines that, in
                   the case of an insurer which is not domiciled in
                   Illinois, the insurer's home state provides
                   substantially similar protection to Illinois residents
                   which will be provided in a timely manner; or

               B)  their policy was issued by an organization which is not
                   a member insurer of the Association.

     c)  Limits on Amount of Coverage:

          1)  The Law also limits the amount the Illinois Life and Health
              Insurance Guaranty Association is obligated to pay.  The
              Guaranty Association's liability is limited to the lesser of
              either:

               A)  the contractual obligations for which the insurer is
                   liable or for which the insurer would have been liable
                   if it were not an impaired or insolvent insurer, or

               B)  with respect to any one life, regardless of the number
                   of policies, contracts, or certificates:

                    i)   in the case of life insurance, $300,000 in death
                         benefits but not more than $100,000 in net cash
                         surrender or withdrawal values;

                    ii)  in the case of health insurance, $300,000 in
                         health insurance benefits, including net cash
                         surrender or withdrawal values; and

                    iii) with respect to annuities, $100,000 in the present
                         value of annuity benefits, including net cash
                         surrender or withdrawal values, and $100,000 in
                         the present value of annuity benefits for
                         individuals participating in certain government
                         retirement plans covered by an unallocated annuity
                         contract.  The limit for coverage of unallocated
                         annuity contracts other than those issued to
                         certain governmental retirement plans is
                         $5,000,000 in benefits per contract holder,
                         regardless of the number of contracts.

          2)  However, in no event is the Guaranty Association liable for
              more than $300,000 with respect to any one individual.

An eligible employer seeking Assigned Risk Insurance will be
bound under the Illinois Assigned Risk Plan in accordance with
the following procedures:

     a)  Within sixty days prior to application the employer must
         have requested and been rejected for standard coverage
         by two insurance carriers, one of which shall have been
         the carrier, if any, with which the employer was last
         insured for Workers' Compensation or Occupational

         review the content of the application.  If the

         carrier's address indicated in the assignment letter, a
         certified check, cashier's check, or a check drawn on
         the agent or broker's Premium Fund Trust Account payable
         to the assigned carrier for either the full amount of

         25% of the estimated annual premium.  If installment
         payments are requested, the deposited submitted shall be
         the deposit required by Section 4801.100 of this Part.

     (Source:  Amended at 6 Ill. Reg.  7226, effective June 4,
         1982) 

 
Section 4801.70  Procedure for Immediate Binding of Coverage
 
An employer seeking Assigned Risk Insurance may be bound under
the Illinois Assigned Risk Plan in accordance with the following
procedures.

     a)  Within sixty days prior to application the employer must
         have requested and been rejected for standard coverage
         by two insurance carriers, one of which shall have been
         the carrier, if any, with which the employer was last
         insured for Workers' Compensation or Occupational
         Diseases Coverage.

     b)  The agent or broker of the employer must contact the
         Bureau and provide the necessary information for the
         Bureau to provide a quotation for the estimated annual
         premium.  After obtaining the quotation, the agent or
         broker shall submit an application for assignment in
         duplicate along with a certified check, cashier's check,
         or a check drawn on the agent or broker's Premium Fund
         Trust Account for at least 25% of the estimated annual
         premium or if installment payments are requested, the
         applicable deposit required by Section 4801.100 of this
         Part.

     c)  Upon application for the binding of immediate coverage,
         the Bureau shall bind coverage effective 12:01 a.m. the
         first day following the date of postmark of the
         application or if the application is hand delivered to
         the Bureau, coverage will be effective 12:01 a.m. of the
         date following receipt by the Bureau.  The Bureau shall
         then notify the assigned carrier in writing as to the
         effective date that coverage was bound.  The assigned
         carrier shall mail to the employer and agent or broker a
         notice as to the amount of any additional premium due
         within ten days of the assignment.  The employer or
         agent or broker shall remit the additional premium, or
         any additional deposit payment due where election is
         made under Section 4801.100 of this Part, within thirty
         days from the date that the notice of additional premium
         is mailed.  The assigned carrier shall maintain proof of
         mailing, on a recognized U. S. Postal Service Form, of
         the notice of additional premium.  Coverage will be
         cancelled by the assigned carrier for nonpayment of
         premium in accordance with Section 143.16 of the
         Illinois Insurance Code if the additional premium, or
         any additional deposit premium due under Section
         4801.100 of this Part, is not received by the assigned
         carrier within thirty days from the date of mailing of
         the notice of additional premium to the employer.

     d)  The Bureau will not bind coverage if the premium does
         not accompany the application.  If an application is
         submitted for the binding of immediate coverage which
         does not contain sufficient information to complete the
         assignment, the Bureau shall advise the agent or broker
         by telephone that the application is being rejected and
         return the application and check to the agent or broker
         with an explanation of the rejection.  Coverage shall
         not be considered bound on rejected applications.

         agent or broker, the agent or broker may deduct the
         applicable commission.

     b)  Where the payment of premium or premium installment is
         made by the employer directly to the assigned carrier,
         within ninety days the assigned carrier shall pay to the
         agent or broker of the employer the applicable amount of
         commission due.

     c)  If there has been no commission paid on an expiring
         policy or existing policy, and the employer desires that
         a commission be paid to an agent or broker, the employer
         shall notify the assigned carrier in writing, or the
         agent or broker may submit to the assigned carrier a
         letter of authority signed by the employer appointing
         the agent or broker as such for the insurance.  If the
         appointment is received by the assigned carrier after
         the date of renewal, the commission shall be paid on a
         pro rata basis for the remainder of the policy term.

     d)  If there has been a commission paid on a policy, the
         agent or broker of record may be changed upon the
         request of the employer effective upon the next renewal
         of the policy.

         40% of the estimated annual premium, and the balance to
         be paid in three (3) equal quarterly installments.

     b)  Where the estimated annual premium is $10,000 or more,
         installment payments will be available on a monthly
         basis.  Payment shall be made by a deposit of at least
         25% of the estimated annual premium, and the balance to

         expiration of the policy, submit to the employer and
         agent or broker a notice of premium for renewal of the
         policy.  If the renewal premium is not received by the
         assigned carrier thirty days prior to the expiration of
         the policy, the assigned carrier shall issue a notice of
         expiration.

     b)  If the renewal premium is received prior to the
         expiration date, the policy  shall be renewed without
         lapse in coverage.  If the renewal premium is received

         carrier may accept renewal premiums more than 30 days
         after the expiration of the policy, which renewal shall
         be effective 12:01 a.m. on the first day following the
         date of postmark on the payment envelope.

 
Section 4801.140  Policy Termination - General

Part as permitted by law.

     a)  Every assigned carrier issuing a policy of Workers'
         Compensation insurance pursuant to this Part shall

         sixty (60) days prior to the proposed termination date.
         A copy of the request must be sent to the employer, the

         policy is being cancelled or nonrenewed.  The
         termination request shall include the proposed date of
         termination, the reason or reasons for the termination,
         and all other information required by law.  The
         termination request shall notify the  employer of the

         request within 45 days, unless a hearing is requested
         pursuant to Section 4801.160 of this Part.

 
Section 4801.150  Policy Termination for Failure to Comply With Employee Welfare Laws

         for termination shall, within ten days after receipt of
         such notice of termination, mail or deliver to the
         Director of Insurance a written request for a hearing
         which shall clearly state the basis for the objection.
         This Section shall not apply to cancellations at the
         employer's request.

     b)  Within ten days after receipt of the request for a
         hearing and upon ten days notice to the parties, the
         Director shall convene a hearing.  Within twenty days of
         the conclusion of the hearing, the Director shall issue
         his written findings to the parties.  The policy will

     (Source:  Amended at 2 Ill. Reg. 29, p. 161, effective July
         17, 1978). 

 
Section 5501.20  Custody, Care and Disposition of Securities
 
     a)  Transfer, sale, assignment or disposition of any
         security belonging to any such company, other than upon
         the surrender thereof for payment at maturity or under
         an option of the maker thereof to repay the same shall
         first have been authorized by the Board of Directors, or
         by a committee thereof charged with the duty of
         supervising investments and loans.

     b)  Any instrument for the assignment, sale, transfer or
         disposition of any such securities and all checks or

         connection with the purchase of any such securities,
         shall require the signature of at least two officers or

         employees designated by the Board of Directors and such
         designation shall require that at least two of the
         persons so designated shall be present at the time of

     a)  All checks, except as hereinafter provided, issued for

         shall require the signature of at least two officers or
         employees of the company who shall have been so
         authorized by the Board of Directors of such company.
         Checks in amounts less than $5,000 may, if, and to the
         extent, authorized by the Board, be issued without such
         dual signatures if the procedure to be followed pursuant
         to such authorization requires an officer or employee,
         other than the authorized signer, to approve such
         payment prior to the issuance of such check.  This dual
         signature requirement shall not apply to drafts.

     b)  Facsimile signatures may be affixed to checks or drafts

         officers or employees other than those affixing such
         facsimile signatures, for supervision and policing of
         the machines or appliances used for affixing such
         signatures and for the recording of checks and drafts to
         which such signatures have been affixed.  Written
         control procedures shall be kept on file and available
         for review by examiners.

         *Note:  Illinois will not accept "bearer" securities as

         surety bonds on employees, officers or positions in an
         amount not less than the amount set forth in the column

         bond, whether by or at the request of the insured or by
         the underwriter, shall take effect prior to the
         expiration of 90 days after written notice of such
         cancellation or termination has been filed with the
         Illinois Department of Insurance unless an earlier date
         of such cancellation or termination is approved by said
         Department of Insurance.

Section 6101.40  Grievance Procedure
 
     a)  Every HMO shall submit for the Director's approval, and
         thereafter maintain, a system for the resolution of
         grievances concerning the provision of health care
         services or other matters concerning operation of the
         HMO as follows.  Each HMO shall:

          1)  Submit to the Director for prior approval any
              proposed changes to the system by which grievances
              may be filed and reviewed:

          2)  Maintain records of each grievance filed with the
              HMO until the grievance is resolved and for a
              period of at least 3 years to include:

               A)  A copy of the grievance, the date of its
                   filing,

               B)  The date and outcome of all consultations,
                   hearings and hearing findings,

               C)  The date and decisions of any appeal

               D)  The date and proceedings of any litigation;

          3)  Submit to the Director in a form prescribed by the
              Director, a report by March 1 for the previous
              calendar year which shall include at least the
              following:  the total number of grievances handled;
              a compilation of causes underlying the grievances;
              the outcomes of the grievances; the elapsed time
              from receipt of the grievance by the HMO until its
              conclusion and the number of malpractice claims
              filed and if such claims have been completely
              adjudicated, a compilation of causes, disposition,
              form and amount of any settlements.

     b)  Every HMO shall have a grievance committee which shall
         have the authority to hear and resolve by majority vote
         grievances submitted to it as provided in Subsection a)
         above.

          1)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
              Section, the grievance committee may, but is not
              required to, hear any grievance which alleges or
              indicates possible professional liability, commonly
              known as "malpractice."

          2)  The committee is not empowered to resolve
              grievances in any manner which, or prescribe any
              actions which, are in conflict with written
              policies of the HMO's Governing Body, but the
              committee may hear such grievances for the purpose
              of providing input to the Governing Body.

          3)  The grievance committee shall meet at the main
              office of the HMO, or such other office designated
              by the HMO where the main office is not within
              fifty (50) miles of the grievant's home address.
              Consideration shall be given to the enrollee's
              request pertaining to the time and date of such
              meeting.  The enrollee shall have the right to
              attend and participate in the formal grievance
              proceedings.  The enrollee shall have the right to
              be represented by a designated representative of
              his choice.

          4)  The filing of a grievance shall not preclude the
              enrollee from a filing complaint with the
              Department nor shall it preclude the Department
              from investigating a complaint pursuant to its
              authority under Section 4-6 of the Act.

     c)  The grievance procedures must be fully and clearly
         communicated to all enrollees and information concerning
         such procedures shall be readily available to the
         enrollee.

     d)  Every HMO shall have simplified procedures for resolving
         complaints.  Such procedures do not require review of
         the complaint by the grievance committee, but a log,
         file, or other similar records must be maintained to
         identify the general nature of such complaints.
         Resolution of such complaints shall not preclude the
         enrollees' rightful access to review by the grievance
         committee of a grievance.

     e)  The HMO shall institute procedures which would require
         grievances to have a determination made by the grievance
         committee within 60 days from the date the grievance is
         received by the HMO.  The determination by the grievance
         committee may be extended for a period not to exceed 30
         days in the event of a delay in obtaining the documents
         or records necessary for the resolution of the
         grievance.  All requests for documents or records
         necessary for the resolution of the grievance shall be
         maintained in the HMO's grievance file.

     f)  The grievance procedure shall provide the enrollee with
         a written acknowledgment of their grievance within 10
         business days after receipt by the HMO.

     g)  The enrollee shall be notified at the time of the
         hearing of the name and affiliation of those grievance
         committee members who are representatives of the HMO.

     h)  The HMO shall institute procedures whereby any
         documentation furnished to the members of the grievance
         committee shall also be made available to the enrollee
         not less than five days prior to the hearing of their
         grievance.  The HMO shall not present any evidence
         without the enrollee having been given the opportunity
         to be present.

     i)  Notification in writing of the determination of the
         grievance committee shall be mailed to the enrollee
         within five (5) business days of such determination.
         Notice of the determination made at the final appeal
         step of the HMO's grievance process shall include a
         'Notice of Availability of the Department'.

Section 6101.50  Contracts and Administrative Arrangements
 
     a)

          1)

               A)  All agreements or contracts under which any
                   Person is delegated management duties or
                   control of the Health Maintenance
                   Organization, or which transfer a substantial
                   part of any major function of the HMO
                   including, but not limited to, all reinsurance
                   treaties, agreements with Providers, IPA's and
                   administrative service contracts must be
                   submitted to the Department of Insurance for
                   prior approval and the HMO must file with the
                   Department any contract amendments, renewals,
                   addendums thereto, or any change from those
                   originally submitted for approval.

               B)  On a quarterly basis, each HMO must submit a
                   list identifying such IPA with which the HMO
                   has a current contract.  Such list must
                   contain the name, address and telephone number
                   of the IPA as well as the name of its
                   Administrator.

          2)  All types of written health care Provider
              agreements must contain provisions whereby the
              Provider shall provide, arrange for, or participate
              in the quality assurance programs mandated by the
              Act, unless the Illinois Department of Public
              Health certifies that such programs will be fully
              implemented without any participation or action
              from such contracting Provider.

          3)  All Provider agreements shall provide for at least
              30 days notice by the Provider for termination with
              cause, as defined in such Provider agreement and at
              least 90 days notice by the Provider for
              termination without cause.  The Health Maintenance
              Organization must inform the Department of
              Insurance immediately of any known or intended
              termination.

          4)  Subscribers must receive notice from the HMO at
              least 45 days in advance of any termination which
              would curtail or eliminate services to subscribers.
              However, in the event that the HMO receives notices
              of less than 45 days from any Provider for
              termination of any contract which would curtail or
              eliminate services to subscribers, the HMO must
              provide immediate notice to the subscribers.

     b)  The contractual agreement between the Provider and the
         HMO must contain evidence that the Provider has
         professional liability insurance and that such insurance
         coverage is effective as of the effective date of such
         contract.  Furthermore, the contract must set forth that
         the Provider will give at least 15 days advance notice
         of cancellation of such insurance.  In those instances
         in which the HMO will provide physician services
         directly through employed physicians and not through
         contractual arrangement with a Provider, the HMO shall
         provide evidence to the Department of Insurance that
         each individual physician has such professional
         liability insurance or that the HMO has such coverage on
         behalf of such employed physicians.

         submitted to the Director prior to the effective date
         and may be disapproved for specific reasons within 45
         days of the filing of supporting information in

     b)  The major cost components that constitute the aggregate

         documents followed by the HMO in determining the rate.

     a)  In the event that any portion of required initial
         minimum capital is provided through a subordinated
         indebtedness agreement, the terms of such indebtness
         must establish that the instrument shall constitute an
         enforceable liability only to the extent the HMO shall
         have surplus in excess of contingency reserves as
         reported in the most recent financial statement filed
         with the Department of Insurance and only after the HMO
         has obtained approval of the Director for any payments
         of interest or any repayments of principal.

     b)  Initial minimum capital or any contributed surplus may
         be used to meet requirements of special contingent
         reserves as mandated in Section 6 of the Act (Ill. Rev.
         Stat., 1981, ch. 111 1/2, par. 1406).

     c)  Dividends to shareholders may be paid only to the extent
         that the HMO shall have the surplus in excess of
         statutory minimums as reported in the most recent
         financial statement filed with the Department of
         Insurance and may be paid  out of only earned surplus.

Every entity possessing a Certificate of Authority to transact
the business of a Health Maintenance Organization shall report
the financial condition and results of its HMO operations in a
form, adopted for the reporting requirements of Section 7 of the

National Association of Insurance Commissioners, as revised, with
such modifications and additions to such form as the Director may
deem desirable and necessary to ascertain the condition, affairs,

         disclosure shall include:

          1)  A description of the obligations to be met by each
              party in accordance with any such arrangements;

          2)  A listing of the dollar amounts of the
              consideration to be paid each party in accordance
              with any such arrangements; and

          3)  A listing and description of any circumstances
              under which a director/principal officer is
              employed by or engages in a substantial commercial

Section 6101.100  Solicitation
 
     a)  No Health Maintenance Organization, or representative
         thereof may cause or knowingly permit the use of
         advertising, solicitation, or any form of evidence of
         coverage which is untrue, misleading or deceptive.

          1)  All information required to be disclosed by these
              rules shall set out conspicuously and in close
              conjunction with the statements to which such
              information relates under appropriate captions of
              such prominence that it shall not be minimized,
              rendered obscure or presented in an ambiguous
              fashion or intermingled with the context of the
              solicitation as to be confusing or misleading.

          2)  The format and context of a solicitation of any
              Health Maintenance Organization's plan or program
              shall be sufficiently complete and clear to avoid
              deception or the capacity or tendency to mislead or
              deceive.  Whether an advertisement has a capacity
              or tendency to mislead or deceive shall be
              determined by the Director from the overall
              impression that the advertisement may be reasonably
              expected to create upon a person of average
              education or intelligence within the segment of the
              public to which it is directed.

          3)  Solicitations shall be truthful and not misleading
              in fact or implication.

Words or phrases, the meaning of which is clear only by
employment or by familiarity with insurance medical terminology
or health care plans shall not be used unless such words or
phrases are otherwise explained in such solicitation.

          4)  No solicitation shall omit information or use
              words, phrases, statements, references, or
              illustrations if an omission of such information or
              use of such words, phrases, statements, references
              or illustrations has the capacity, tendency or
              effect of misleading or deceiving prospective
              enrollees as to the nature or extent of any benefit
              payable, loss covered, premium payable or health
              care service provided.

     b)  A detailed description of all training and educational
         programs provided to solicitors of the Health Care Plan
         or to any person providing Marketing activities shall be
         submitted to the Director upon application for a
         Certificate of Authority and any substantive changes,

         advertising materials which an HMO applying for
         Certificate of Authority plans to use must be filed with
         the Department of Insurance.  Such material must be
         filed before use and, in the event that such material
         can obviously not be filed, such as audiovisual
         presentations, a description of the solicitation
         activity must be filed.

     d)  A list of producers who will solicit the Health Care
         Plan, including the names and addresses of such
         producers shall be submitted to the Director with the
         Annual Report and any change, thereafter, in such list
         shall be submitted to the Director within 30 days of
         such change.

     e)  Any advertisement or solicitation shall not directly or
         indirectly make unfair or incomplete comparisons of
         policies, plans, or benefits or comparisons of
         non-comparable plans or policies of other HMO's or
         insurers, and shall not disparage competitors, their
         policies or plans, services or business methods and
         shall not disparage or unfairly minimize a competing
         method of marketing insurance or health care services.

     f)  No advertisement or marketing material of an HMO shall
         imply that certification by the Department of Insurance
         is an endorsement of the HMO.

     g)  Failure to comply with the requirements of this Section

     h)  The HMO shall include in its enrollee handbook or
         similar material a description of the HMO's grievance
         procedure, directions for filing a grievance, and
         "Notice of Availability of the Department."

Section 6101.110  Requirements for Group Contracts, Evidences of Coverage and Individual Contracts
 
     a)  Any group contract, evidence of coverage, individual
         contract, enrollment application or other form which
         affects the terms and conditions applicable to the
         subscriber or enrollee in the provision of health care
         services must be filed with and approved by the Director
         prior to use in accordance with the requirements of
         Section 6101.112 of this Part and Section 4-13 of the
         Act.  The HMO shall issue to each subscriber or enrollee
         a group contract, evidence of coverage, or individual
         contract.  Any such group contract, evidence of
         coverage, or individual contract shall provide for the
         rendering of health care services as defined therein for
         either a specific period of not less than twelve months
         from the date of issuance or for such period as is
         otherwise mutually agreed to by the HMO and the group or
         individual contractholder; and shall provide for renewal
         on a basis mutually agreed to by both parties, unless
         the HMO has given thirty-one days written notice of
         nonrenewal prior to the renewal date of the contract.

     b)  A detailed statement of any exceptions, exclusions or
         limitations shall be set forth in the group contract,
         evidence of coverage, and individual contract  for any
         type of health care service to be excepted.  Such
         exceptions, exclusions or limitations shall appear with
         the same prominence in the group contract, evidence of
         coverage and individual contract as any benefit.

     c)  The group contract, evidence of coverage, and individual
         contract shall set forth a detailed statement of the
         terms and conditions of maternity benefits and any
         related exceptions, exclusions, limitations, co-payments
         and deductibles.  However, such exceptions, exclusions,
         limitations, co-payments and deductibles applicable to
         prenatal and post-natal care shall be no different than
         other covered Health Care Services provided, however,
         that a limitation for coverage of routine prenatal care
         or delivery where the enrollee is outside the service
         area against medical advice, except where the enrollee
         is outside of the service area due to circumstances
         beyond her control, may be included in the group
         contract and evidence of coverage.

     d)  Entire Contract.  The group contract, evidence of
         coverage and individual contract shall contain a
         statement that the group contract evidence of coverage
         and individual contract, all applications, and any
         amendments thereto shall constitute the entire agreement
         between the parties.  No portion of the charter, by-laws
         or other document of the HMO shall be part of such a
         contract or evidence of coverage unless set forth in
         full in such document or attached thereto.

     e)  Eligibility Requirements.  The group contract, evidence
         of coverage and individual contract shall contain
         eligibility requirements indicating the conditions that
         must be met to enroll in a health care plan, the
         limiting age for enrollees and eligible dependents
         including the effects of Medicare eligibility, and a
         clear statement regarding coverage of newborn children
         as set forth in Section 4-8 and 4-9 of the Act.

     f)  Benefits and Services Within the Service Area.  The
         group contract, evidence of coverage and individual
         contract shall contain a specific description of
         benefits and services available within the HMO's
         designated service area.

     g)  Emergency Care Services.  The group contract, evidence
         of coverage shall contain a specific description of
         benefits and services available for emergencies 24-hours
         a day, 7 days a week, including disclosure of any
         restrictions on emergency care services.  No group
         contract or evidence of coverage shall limit the
         coverage of emergency services within the service area
         to those providers having a contract with the HMO.

     h)  Out of Area Benefits and Services.  The group contract,
         evidence of coverage and individual contract shall
         contain a specific description of benefits and services
         available out of the HMO's designated service area.

     i)  Deductibles and Copayments.  An HMO may require
         copayments of enrollees as a condition for the receipt
         of specific health care services. Deductibles and
         copayments shall be the only allowable charge, other
         than premiums, assessed enrollees.  Copayments shall be
         for a specific dollar amount.  Deductibles shall be
         either for a specific dollar amount or for a specific
         percentage of the cost of the health care service.  No
         single deductible or copayment for basic health care
         services may exceed 50% of the usual and customary fee
         of the service to the HMO and must be waived when in a
         calendar year, deductibles and copayments paid for the
         receipt of basic health care services exceed 150% of the
         premium paid by or on behalf of the enrollee.
         Deductibles and copayments applicable to supplemental
         health care services or pre-existing conditions shall
         not be subject to this annual limitation.

     j)  Pre-existing Conditions.  An HMO may impose deductible
         and copayment pre-existing condition limitations as a
         condition to receiving health care services.  A
         pre-existing condition shall not be defined more
         restrictively than a condition for which medical advice
         or treatment was recommended by a physician or received
         from a physician within a one year period preceding the
         effective date of coverage under the health care plan or
         the existence of symptoms which, in the opinion of a
         legally qualified physician, would have caused an
         ordinarily prudent person to seek diagnosis, care or
         treatment within a one year period preceding the
         effective date of coverage under the health care plan.
         Such condition may only be limited for a period not to
         exceed one year from the effective date of coverage.

     k)  Cancellation.  The group contract, evidence of coverage,
         and individual contract shall contain the conditions
         upon which cancellation may be effected by the HMO or
         the enrollee as set forth in Section 6101.111 of this
         Part.

     l)  Reinstatement.  The group contract, evidence of
         coverage, and individual contract shall contain the
         conditions of the enrollee's right to reinstatement.

     m)  Grace Period.  A group contract or individual contract
         shall provide for a grace period for the payment of any
         premium, except the first, during which coverage shall
         remain in effect if payment is made during the grace
         period.  The grace period for a group contract shall not
         be less than ten (10) days.  The grace period for an
         individual contract shall not be less than thirty-one
         (31) days.  During the grace period, the HMO shall
         remain liable for providing the services and benefits
         contracted for; the subscriber shall remain liable for
         the payment of the premium for the time coverage was in
         effect during the grace period and the enrollee shall
         remain liable for the payment of any applicable share of
         the premium, for the time coverage was in effect, as
         well as for any copayments owed.

     n)  No group contract, or evidence of coverage, or
         individual contract may be delivered in this state
         unless the subscriber and/or enrollee is provided
         written notice required by Section 143c of the Illinois
         Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 73, par.
         755c).

     o)  Right to Examine Contract.  An individual contract shall
         contain a provision stating that an enrollee who has
         entered into an agreement with a HMO shall be permitted
         to return the individual contract within ten days of
         receiving it and to receive a refund of the premium paid
         if the enrollee is not satisfied with the contract for
         any reason.  If the individual contract is returned to
         the HMO or to its representative through whom it was
         purchased, it is considered void from the beginning.
         However, if services are rendered or claims are paid for
         such enrollee or dependent by the HMO during the ten-day
         examination period, the enrollee shall not be permitted
         to return the contract and receive a refund of the
         premium paid.

     p)  Identification cards must prominently display the
         following information:

          1)  the words "Health Maintenance Organization" or
              "HMO"; and

          2)  disclaimer language concerning an enrollee's
              unauthorized use of providers not selected by the
              HMO; and

          3)  a current telephone number for the enrollees to use
              when health care services are required outside of
              normal office hours.

     q)  Enrollment Application.  No individual contract shall be
         issued except upon the signed enrollment application of
         the enrollee for whom coverage is being sought.  Any
         information or statement of the applicant shall appear
         on such application in the form of interrogatories by
         the HMO and answers by the applicant. The enrollee shall
         not be bound by any statement made within an application
         for health care coverage unless a copy of such
         application is attached to the individual contract.
         Group enrollment applications must be maintained on file
         by the HMO; otherwise, disputes arising from statements
         made within such applications will be resolved in the
         enrollee's favor.  Except for those instances involving
         fraud or material misrepresentation, an HMO's failure to
         investigate incomplete or conflicting answers on an
         enrollment application, shall estop the HMO from
         subsequently denying coverage on the basis of such
         responses.

     r)  Coordination of Benefits.

          1)  HMO's are permitted, but not required to adopt
              coordination of benefits provisions to avoid over
              insurance and to provided for the orderly payment
              of claims when a person is covered by two or more
              group health insurance or health care plans.

          2)  If an HMO adopts coordination of benefits, the
              provision must be consistent with the coordination
              of benefits requirements set forth in 50 Ill. Adm.
              Code 2009.

          3)  To the extent necessary for an HMO to meet its
              obligations as a secondary carrier under 50 Ill.
              Adm. Code 2009, and where an enrollee has
              established a credit within the reserve bank, the
              HMO shall make payments for services that are:

               A)  received from non-participating providers; or

               B)  provided outside their services areas; or

               C)  not covered under the terms of health care
                   plan.

     s)  Dependents-termination of coverage-disability and
         dependency, proof-application.  Every group contract,
         evidence of coverage, or individual contract which
         provides that coverage of a dependent person of an
         enrollee shall terminate upon attainment of the limiting
         age for dependent persons shall comply with the
         requirements of Section 4-9.1 of the Act.

     t)  Conversion of coverage.

          1)  The group contract and evidence of coverage shall
              contain a conversion provision which provides that
              each enrollee has the right to convert coverage to
              an individual or group contract in the following
              circumstances:  upon cancellation of eligibility
              for coverage under a group contract, or upon
              cancellation of the group contract.  The conversion
              contract shall cover the enrollee and his/her
              eligible dependents who were covered by the group
              contract on the date of cancellation of coverage.
              To obtain the conversion contract, an enrollee
              shall submit a written application and the
              application premium payment within 31 days after
              the date the enrollee's coverage is cancelled.  The
              HMO may require copayments and deductibles under a
              conversion contract that differ from the group
              contract.

          2)  A conversion contract shall not be required to be
              made available if:

               A)  The cancellation of the enrollee's coverage
                   occurred for any of the reasons listed in
                   Section 6101.111(a); or

               B)  The enrollee is covered by or is eligible for
                   benefits under Title XVIII of the United
                   States Social Security Act; or

               C)  The enrollee is covered by similar hospital,
                   medical, or surgical benefits under state or
                   federal law; or

               D)  The enrollee is covered by similar hospital,
                   medical, or surgical benefits under any
                   arrangement of coverage for individuals in a
                   group whether on an insured or uninsured
                   basis; or

               E)  The enrollee is covered for similar benefits
                   through individual coverage; or

               F)  The enrollee has not been continuously covered
                   during the three-month period immediately
                   preceding cancellation of that person's
                   coverage; or

               G)  The enrollee has moved outside of the service
                   area of the health maintenance organization;
                   or

               H)  The cancellation of the enrollee's coverage
                   occurred in relation to the HMO being placed
                   in rehabilitation or liquidation proceedings
                   pursuant to Section 5-6 of the Act; or

               I)  The group contract has been discontinued in
                   its entirety and there is a succeeding carrier
                   providing coverage to the group in its
                   entirety.

          3)  Benefits or coverage shall be considered "similar"
              if coverage is provided for at least 12 months
              under comprehensive type medical coverage.

          4)  Notwithstanding subsection (2)(C), (D) or (E), or
              (I) if the enrollee or any of his or her covered
              dependents has a pre-existing condition, and the
              enrollee is covered by similar hospital, medical or
              surgical benefits under any arrangement of coverage
              for individuals in a group, whether on an insured
              or uninsured basis, and such coverage does not
              cover pre-existing conditions, then such enrollee
              may continue conversion coverage for the individual
              with such pre-existing condition until the
              enrollee's or dependent's pre-existing condition is
              covered under the succeeding plan.

          5)  The conversion contract shall provide as a minimum
              to its enrollees basic health care services.

          6)  The conversion contract shall begin coverage of the
              enrollee and any dependents formerly covered under
              the group contract on the date of termination from
              the group or the former individual contract.

          7)  Coverage shall be provided without requiring
              evidence of insurability and shall not impose any
              pre-existing condition limitations or exclusions
              other than those remaining unexpired under the
              contract from which conversion is exercised.

          8)  Conversion charge shall be provided for a period of
              not less than 18 months.

     u)  Discrimination between individuals of the same class in
         the terms and conditions of such health care plan, or in
         the amount charged for coverage under a health care plan
         except where the rate differential is based on sound
         actuarial principles, or in any other manner whatsoever
         is prohibited.

Section 6101.111  Cancellation
 
     a)  No HMO shall cancel a group or individual contract or
         evidence of coverage except for one or more of the
         following reasons:

          1)  Failure of the enrollee to pay the amount due under
              the contract or evidence of coverage, for which the
              enrollee is legally responsible; or

          2)  Fraud or material misrepresentation in enrollment
              or in the use of services or facilities; or

          3)  Material violation of the terms of the contract or
              evidence of coverage; or

          4)  Failure of the enrollee and the primary care
              physician to establish a satisfactory
              patient-physician relationship if the enrollee has
              repeatedly refused to follow the plan of treatment
              ordered by the physician; it is shown that the HMO
              has in good faith provided the enrollee with the
              opportunity to select an alternative primary care
              physician; and the enrollee has been notified in
              writing at least 31 days in advance that the HMO
              considers such patient-physician relationship to be
              unsatisfactory; or

          5)  Such other good cause agreed upon in the contract
              and approved by the Director pursuant to Section
              4-13 of the Act.

     b)  A group contract, evidence of coverage or individual
         contract may not be cancelled for any of the following
         reasons:

          1)  The status of the enrollee's health;

          2)  The enrollee has exercised his or her rights under
              the HMO's grievance system.

              losses and loss adjustment expenses shall be
              presented on an undiscounted basis; provided,
              however, that a trust may present such reserves on
              a discounted basis in accordance with Section
              6201.75 of this Part.

          2)  A statement of income, expenses and fund balance.

          3)  A complete and detailed listing of each investment

              insurance companies.

          4)  A statement of cash flows.

     b)  With the exception of loss reserve discounting permitted
         by Section 6201.75 of this Part, the financial

         accounting principles permitted or prescribed for use by
         property casualty insurance companies.

     c)  In addition, each trust shall file audited financial
         statements audited by an independent certified public

         Section 6201.20 of this Part.  The auditing standards to
         be employed are those recommended by the American
         Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  In addition
         to any other information the Director may require to be
         disclosed, the audited financial report shall include
         the following:

          1)  Report of independent certified public accountant.

          2)  Balance sheet reporting assets, liabilities and

Section 6201.75  Loss Reserve Discounting
 
     a)  A trust may discount its reserves for incurred and
         unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, for the
         purpose of:

          1)  Reporting under Section 14 of the Act and Section
              6201.70 of this Part, and

          2)  Demonstrating its net worth and adherence to
              reasonable standards of financial solvency, subject
              to all of the following conditions:

               A)  The trust shall have been approved for
                   operation under the Act for not less than two
                   (2) full calendar years.

               B)  The trust instrument shall provide that each
                   beneficiary may be assessed for any funding
                   deficiency relating to any period in which the
                   beneficiary participated in the trust and that
                   each beneficiary shall be fully liable to the
                   trust for any such assessment; a beneficiary's
                   obligation for any such assessment shall be
                   enforceable regardless of whether the
                   beneficiary is currently a beneficiary of the
                   trust, unless the trust has expressly released
                   the beneficiary with respect to such
                   obligations.

               C)  With respect to each reporting year, the
                   assumed rate of return used to discount the
                   trust's reserves for losses and loss
                   adjustment expenses shall not exceed the
                   greater of:

                    i)   The trust's average annual portfolio
                         rate of return over the five (5) year
                         period (or such shorter period, in the
                         event that the trust has not been in
                         existence for five (5) years) ending
                         with the last day of the then-current
                         reporting year, less 1/2 of 1%; or

                    ii)  The assumed rate of return used to
                         discount the trust's loss reserves for
                         federal income tax purposes, for the tax
                         year corresponding to the then-current
                         reporting year.

               D)  In conjunction with the financial statements
                   required by Section 6201.70 of this Part, the
                   trust shall file with the Director a statement
                   of actuarial opinion by a qualified
                   independent actuary, setting forth his or her
                   opinion regarding the adequacy of the trust's
                   reserves for losses and loss adjustment
                   expenses, in such form and of such content as
                   specified in the National Association of
                   Insurance Commissioners Annual Statement
                   Instructions:  Property and Casualty.  For
                   purposes of this Section, the term "qualified
                   independent actuary" shall mean an individual
                   is either:

                    i)   A member in good standing of the

                         American Academy of Actuaries who has

                         casualty loss reserve opinions by the
                         Casualty Practice Council of the
                         American Academy of Actuaries.

               E)  With respect to each reporting year, the trust
                   shall present the following information in the
                   footnotes to the financial statements or as
                   supplemental information to the information
                   required by Section 6201.70 of this Part:

                    i)   The ultimate, undiscounted loss and loss
                         adjustment expenses reserves in
                         comparison to the reported, discounted
                         value of such reserves, with the
                         aggregate effect of the discount
                         reflected as a separate amount, reviewed
                         by a qualified independent actuary.  In
                         addition, the report of the trust's
                         certified public accountants, as
                         contemplated in subsection 6201.70(c) of
                         this Part, shall include a review of the
                         calculation of the discounted loss and
                         loss adjustment expense reserves.

                    ii)  An historical and projected loss and
                         loss adjustment expense payout schedule,
                         demonstrating the portion of incurred
                         losses and loss adjustment expenses paid
                         and projected to be paid in the periods
                         following the period in which the
                         underlying loss was incurred, reviewed
                         by a qualified independent actuary.

                    iii) A schedule of portfolio investments,
                         including scheduled maturities, and a
                         report of the trust's aggregate
                         portfolio rate of return for the year.
                         If the trust's investments are managed
                         by any third-party manager or trustee,
                         such portfolio rate of return shall be
                         verified by such manager or trustee.

     b)  A trust which does not comply with all of the conditions
         set forth in subsection (a), above, may discount its
         reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, but
         only upon receiving the express written approval of the
         Director with respect to each calendar year that the
         trust proposes to discount such reserves.  Any trust
         desiring the Director's approval under this subsection
         shall submit a written request therefor, prior to
         September 1 of the year to which the request relates,
         setting forth:

          1)  The terms upon which such discounting will be
              based,

          2)  an estimate of the anticipated effect of such
              discounting, and

          3)  the trusts' commitment to provide the specific
              information set forth in subsection (a)(2)(E),
              above.  The Director shall not approve any request
              to discount reserves under this subsection if the
              presentation of the trust's reserves for loss and
              loss adjustment expenses on a discounted basis
              would not accurately reflect the trust's financial
              condition and would be misleading to its
              beneficiaries or the general public.  The Director
              shall approve or disapprove any such request within
              thirty (30) days of receipt thereof.

     (Source:  Added at 18 Ill. Reg. 2282, effective February 1,
         1994) 

 
Section 6201.80  Liquidation
 
Each trust is required to adhere to reasonable standards of
financial solvency.  Should the Director, within his discretion
and based upon examination or investigation, determine that any
trust is no longer adhering to reasonable standards of financial
solvency, he may undertake appropriate proceedings in order to
liquidate the trust entity.

 
Section 6201.90  Amendments to the Trust Instrument
 
     a)  All amendments or modifications to the originally
         approved trust instrument shall be made in writing and
         filed in duplicate with the Director of Insurance and
         approved by the Director of Insurance to their taking
         effect.

     b)  All trustees selected as successors to the original
         trustees set forth in the application required by
         Section 6201.20 of this Part shall submit complete
         biographical data to the Director of Insurance within 14
         days of their appointment.  This requirement may be
         satisfied by the filing of such data by the trust or
         trust administrator and shall be kept as a part of the
         permanent records of the trust.

 
Section 6201.100  Pooling Among Several Trusts
 
     a)  No trust established and approved pursuant to the
         provisions of this Act shall enter into any written
         agreements with any other trust fund for the pooling and
         sharing of risks unless such other trust funds have been
         established and approved pursuant to the provisions of
         this Act.

     b)  No trust established and approved pursuant to the
         provisions of this Act shall pool or share risks with
         any other trust established by the laws of any state of
         the United States other than Illinois.  It is the
         specific intention of this provision to limit the
         pooling and sharing of risks among religious and
         charitable risk pooling trusts to trust funds approved
         pursuant to the Act and located in Illinois.

 
Section 6201.110  Administrators
 
     a)  Each trust approved pursuant to the Act may engage an

         operating the trust fund.  Such administrator shall be a
         resident of the State of Illinois with its principal
         office located within the State of Illinois.  Such
         administrator may be a natural person, partnership or
         corporate entity.

     b)  All persons administering a trust approved pursuant to
         the provisions of the Act shall be subject to the
         examination of the Director of Insurance in accordance
         with Section 132 of the Illinois Insurance Code and
         shall maintain all trust records within the State of
         Illinois.

     c)  All administrators of trusts approved pursuant to the
         provisions of the Act must adhere to all standards of
         fiduciary conduct required by the laws of the State of
         Illinois and must adhere to all standards of claims
         practices and procedures set forth in the Illinois
         Insurance Code and all Rules promulgated thereunder.

 
Section 6201.120  Severability

effect other provisions or applications of this Act which can be
given affect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions of the Part are severable.

Section 6301.10  Authority
 
This Part is promulgated by the Director of Insurance of the
State of Illinois pursuant to Section 22-501.1 of the Illinois
Pension Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 108 1/2, par. 22-501.1)
which empowers the Director "...to make reasonable rules and
regulations...as may be necessary for making effective and
implementing the provisions of the Pension Code..." The purpose
of this Part is to establish uniform procedures for examination,
compliance with examination, annual financial reports, hearing
and other matters.

 
Section 6301.20  Scope
 
This Part shall apply to all pension, annuity or retirement funds
or systems with less than 500 participants not financed in whole
or in part by funds of the State of Illinois.
 

Section 6301.30  Examinations
 
     a)  Each fund or system shall be subject to periodic
         examinations as provided for by Section 22-502 of the
         Pension Code.  Each fund or system shall provide all
         books, records, documents, files and other relevant
         memoranda to the persons conducting the examination upon
         request and shall assist in the examination as
         necessary.

     b)  Upon completion of the examination and prior to the
         preparation of the report of examination, each fund or
         system examined shall receive a letter signed by the
         examiner in charge of the examination detailing the
         procedures to be followed in publishing the report of
         examination and to obtain compliance with the Pension
         laws.  (Exhibit A-1 through A-4)

     c)  The procedure to be followed to publish a report of
         examination:

          1)  A copy of the examination report shall be submitted
              to the secretary of the governing board of each
              fund or system examined.  The governing board of
              the fund or system shall have 30 days from the date
              of receipt of the report to request, in writing, a
              hearing.  If a hearing is requested, it shall be
              conducted in accordance with Section 6301.40 of
              this Part.  The sole issue will be accuracy of
              facts contained in the report of examination.

          2)  If no request for hearing is made or after a
              hearing and the entry of an order, the report
              examination shall be filed and the contents are
              then public information.

          3)  Upon the filing of the report of examination, the
              Director shall enter an Order requiring compliance
              with the Pension laws, if necessary.  The Order
              shall set forth all areas wherein compliance is
              necessary and shall provide for a time period, not
              longer than 15 days, by which compliance must be
              made.  (Exhibit B)

     d)  The procedure to be followed for compliance, where
         necessary:

          1)  If compliance with the Director's Order is not
              accomplished in the time required, a Notice of
              Hearing shall be sent to each fund or system not in
              compliance.  (Exhibit C)

          2)  The hearing shall be held in Springfield and shall
              be conducted in accordance with the procedures set
              forth in Section 6301.40 of this Rule.

          3)  The Director as the result of the hearing shall
              Order compliance within 30 days of his Order in
              those areas found not to be in compliance.  Failure
              to comply or initiate an administrative review
              action within the 30 day time period will require
              the Director to assess a civil penalty against the
              governing body, officer or official of the fund or
              system in the amount of $50 for each day such
              noncompliance continues beyond the 30 day time
              period allowed for compliance.  In no event shall
              the amount of such civil penalty exceed $1,000.  If
              the Director receives, prior to the expiration of
              the 30 day time period, the certified statement of
              the governing body, officer or official, setting
              forth the steps to be taken to obtain full
              compliance and the expected date of full
              compliance, then the civil penalty shall be stayed
              until the specified date.  If full compliance is
              not obtained by that date the civil penalty of $50
              a day shall be assessed as set forth above.

          4)  If the Order of the Director is not satisfied and
              the fine not paid within  30 days of the
              assessment, the Director shall report the
              noncompliance to the Attorney General and request
              judicial action for compliance.

     a)  All hearings provided for in this Part or by Sections
         22-502 or 22-509 of the Pension Code shall be conducted

         Ill. Adm. Code 2402) of the Illinois Department of
         Insurance.

     b)  All hearings not governed by the provisions of Section
         6301.30(c) of this Part shall be governed by the
         following procedures:

              which noncompliance is alleged.

          2)  If the Director does not receive within a
              reasonable time not to exceed 15 days, evidence
              that compliance is being achieved, he shall issue
              an Order to Show Cause to the governing body,
              officer or official to appear and show good and
              sufficient cause for the noncompliance.

              cause for the noncompliance alleged he may issue
              orders and assess civil penalties as permitted by
              Section 6301.30 (d) (3) of this Part.

          1.  A draft of the report will be mailed to you, and
              you will then have 30 days to comply with any
              deficiencies noted in the summary or request a
              hearing if you disagree with the FACTS of the
              report.

          2.  If you request a hearing, a notice of the time,

                                      Very truly yours,


                                      __________________________

Section 6301.EXHIBIT B  Examiners Comments Letter
 
Enclosed is a copy of the report covering the recent examination
of your Pension Fund.

We wish to call your attention to the examiners' findings in the
summary of your report.  Particular attention should be given by
the Board to item(s) number              in the summary.

In reference to the examiners' comments made in the summary, a
letter should be directed to my attention no later than 30 days
from the date of this letter stating whether or not the Board
agrees with the findings of the examiners.  If they do agree
please state precisely how the Board proposes to implement the
necessary changes.  This letter should cover each item mentioned
in the summary.

If the Board disagrees or cares to object to these findings, the
Director of Insurance, upon request, shall grant a hearing to the
officers of Trustees of the Fund or their duly appointed
representatives before making public the enclosed examination
report.  If a hearing is requested, the facts of the report will
be the sole issue and the hearing will be conducted in accordance
with the Pension Division Rule.

If no comment is received within this prescribed period, the
report will be filed as public record as now stated.

Should you want to discuss any matter contained in this report,
we shall be pleased to make an appointment for that purpose or
you may feel free to call me personally in Springfield at (217)
782-7542.

In addition to the examination report, also enclosed is a
certificate which should be signed by each of the Fund's Trustees
and returned to this office along with a letter containing the
Board's comments.

Your cooperation in this regard will be appreciated, as we wish
to assure ourselves that all the Trustees have knowledge of the
condition of the Fund as disclosed by the report of examination.

examination of the                        Pension Fund of
              , Illinois, which now has been filed as an official
record of this Department.  Each Trustee is to receive a copy of
this report.

Since no response was received from the Board to my letter of
              , which was submitted along with the initial draft
of the report, it is assumed that the Board agreed with the
exceptions noted in the summary of the report and steps have been
taken to correct each problem area.  In this connection the
Trustees' attention is directed to the "compliance notice"
located just behind the Director's letter in the front of the
report.

Please respond in writing within fifteen (15) days from the date
of this letter to confirm that the Fund has complied with each
item listed in the "compliance notice."

If the Division has not received satisfactory evidence of
compliance within 15 days as required by the Director's order,
the Division may without further notice issue a Notice of Hearing
pursuant to Section 22-509 of the Illinois Pension Code.

                                      Very truly yours,

AUTHORITY:  Implementing and authorized by Section 22-501.1 of
the Illinois Pension Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 108 1/2,
par. 22-501.1).
<P>
SOURCE:  Adopted at 3 Ill. Reg. 15, p. 104, effective April 9,
1979; codified at 6 Ill. Reg. 14844; amended at 13 Ill. Reg.
3801, effective March 15, 1989.
<P><HR><PRE><WIDTH=70>
Section 6302.10  Authority
 
This Rule is promulgated by the Director of Insurance of the
State of Illinois pursuant to Section 22.501.1 of the Illinois
Pension Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 108 1/2, par. 22-501.1)
which empowers the Director "...to make reasonable rules and
regulations...as may be necessary for making effective and
implementing the provisions of the Pension Code..." The purpose
of this Rule is to define the word "salary" as used in Ill. Rev.
Stat. 1981, ch. 108 1/2, pars. 3-125 and 4-124.

 
Section 6302.20  Scope
 
This Rule shall apply to all pension, annuity or retirement funds
or systems with less than 500 participants not financed in whole
or in part by funds of the State of Illinois.

 
Section 6302.30  Salary Contributions and Pension Computations
 
If the municipality's appropriation ordinance assigns a salary to
a policeman's or fireman's rank, that salary, as regularly
received by the policeman or fireman, shall be used to determine
salary contributions and pension computations.  Otherwise, salary
shall include all regularly received salary attached to rank.
The word "rank" is not limited to civil service ranks but
includes all specialty ranks such as "Detective," "Juvenile
Officer," "Special Instructor," "Shift Commander," "Training
Officer," "Chief," "E.M.T.," "Paramedic," "Range Officer,"
"Mechanic," etc., as well as classifications devoting
compensation for education and other work-related achievements.

 
Section 6302.40  Items Not Included in Salary
 
The following shall not be included in salary unless established
by the appropriation ordinance:

     a)  Call-back pay or other salary earned as a result of
         working more than the regular working hours.

     b)  Holiday pay which is distinguishable as an addition to
         salary regularly received or is an additional  amount
         paid only to persons who actually worked on a designated
         holiday.

     c)  Temporary pay.  This is the additional salary earned
         while filling in on a temporary basis for an employee of
         a higher rank or position who is absent or otherwise
         separated from service.  However, where an employee has
         served in a temporary assignment continuously for more
         than one year, such assignment shall be considered the
         same as a "specialty rank" (see Section 6302.30 for
         examples of specialty rank) for pension contributions
         and benefits.

     d)  Reimbursements for particular expenses incurred such as
         food allowance or uniform allowance.

     e)  Lump sum payments which are in addition to regular
         salary attached to rank for such things as earned
         vacation, compensatory time, sick days or other personal
         leave days.

     f)  Lump sum bonuses of a non-recurring nature which may be
         paid for extraordinary deeds or accomplishments.

     (Source:  Amended at 13 Ill. Reg. 3801, effective March 15,
         1989) 

 
Section 6302.50  Longevity Pay
 
Longevity pay, whether paid concurrently with regular salary or
in a lump sum annually, is included in salary.  Where longevity
pay is paid in a lump sum annually, it should be prorated to
compute pensions of firemen or disabled policemen.

              fiduciary account in a financial institution
              located in this State, which account shall be
              designated as an "Administrator Trust Fund",

              preferred provider program may establish separate
              fiduciary accounts for each program, or may
              maintain a consolidated fiduciary account for such
              programs.  If a consolidated Administrator Trust
              Fund account is maintained the administrator's

              administrative fees due the administrator pursuant
              to a written agreement.

              disbursements.

          5)  If the ATF is interest bearing or income producing,
              the full nature of the account must first be
              disclosed to the principal, whether insurer or
              other payor of services under the preferred
              provider program, on whose behalf the funds are or

              this principal for the investment of money and
              retention of interest or earnings.

              bearing or income producing investments and retain

                   Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation
                   (FSLIC), so long as any deposit does not
                   exceed the maximum level of insurance
                   protection provided to certificates of
                   deposits held by such institutions.

                   paper is rated at least P-l by Moody's

               E)  Money Market Funds, provided the money market
                   fund invests exclusively in assets which are
                   allowable investments pursuant to subsection
                   A) through D) above for ATF funds;

               F)  Each investment transaction must be made in
                   the name of the administrator's ATF.  The
                   administrator must maintain evidence of any
                   such investments.  Each investment transaction
                   must flow through the administrator's ATF.

               B)  The detailed preparation, journalizing and
                   posting of such books and records must be
                   maintained on a timely basis and all journal

         be verified by the examiner.  The report must be made to

         upon expiration of the time period during which an
         administrator may request a hearing,  if the examination

Section 6602.10  Purpose and Scope

requirements for the specific information required to be reported
to the Director of Insurance by Section 1204 (A)-(D) of the
Illinois Insurance Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 73, par.
1065.904 (A)-(D)) and to establish the medium upon which such
information shall be transmitted to the Director.  The reporting
and medium requirements are contained in Appendices A-M.  This
Part shall apply to each company licensed to write property or
casualty insurance in this State pursuant to Section 4, Class 2

         business written separately for Illinois and
         country-wide (including Illinois) for each line, subline
         or class specified by this Part.  Where zip code
         reporting is required, each line, subline or class shall
         be reported separately for each zip code.  Zip code
         reporting shall be required for Illinois personal lines
         business only.

     b)  Submission of Data

          1)  Annual reporting of data shall be in accordance
              with Appendix C.

          2)  Semi-annual reporting of data shall be in
              accordance with Appendix D.

          3)  Companies required to report country-wide data
              shall be required to report detailed data on a
              country-wide basis if the insurer is in the 90th
              percentile of the total country-wide written
              premium for the business line within which such
              detailed classifications are found.

     c)  Methods of Compiling Annual Experience
         Experience for each class or type of business required
         shall be provided for the applicable statistical methods
         described in Appendix C.  The statistical period(s) for
         reporting each type or class of business shall be
         specified in the prescribed reporting formats.

          1)  Accident Year

              A comparison of the incurred losses on claims
              occurring in a given twelve month period with the
              exposures and premiums earned in that same period.

          2)  Policy Year

              A comparison of the incurred losses occurring under
              policies having inception dates in a given calendar
              year with the exposures and premiums on such
              policies.

          3)  Calendar Year

              A comparison of the incurred losses during a given
              twelve month period with the exposures and premiums
              earned in the same period.

     d)  Recording of Statistics

              Insurers may use any method for the recording of
              statistics, including any type of record format
              convenient to their statistical or accounting
              procedures, provided that statistics shall be
              reported by the insurer within the required time
              using the codes and record format provided in
              Appendix B and G-M.

     e)  Preparation and Completion of Reports of Statistics

          1)  Insurers may report statistics directly, or through
              an advisory organization.  Advisory organizations
              reporting data for more than one insurer shall
              report class data separately for each insurer
              represented.

          2)  The reports of premiums and the reports of losses
              and loss adjustment expenses shall be reported in
              the record formats prescribed in Appendix B.

          3)  The filing of statistics shall be accompanied by a
              transmittal letter showing summary totals for each
              line of business even if the amount is zero and
              shall be in agreement with the records of the
              insurer for the period covered.  The totals shall
              also include, by line of business, the amount net
              of corrections made in the quarter.

          4)  Prior to submission of statistics, the insurer
              shall audit the statistics being reported to detect
              and correct any errors in the assignment of
              statistical classifications.

          5)  Prior to requiring any supporting statistical data,
              the Director shall provide the insurer with a
              letter giving the details for special reporting.
              The request letter will be issued to the insurers
              on or before September 1 of each year.  The
              requested data shall be submitted within 90 days of
              the receipt of the request.

          6)  If an insurer finds that it has no data to report
              please use Appendix B.  "Additional comments if
              necessary for clarification:" to explain that the
              company has no data to report for this filing.

     f)  Reinsurance

         Reinsurance statistics shall be reported for direct
         business only.  Therefore, the reports of statistics
         shall not include premiums received from or losses paid
         to other insurers because of the reinsurance assumed by
         the reporting insurers; nor, shall any deductions be
         made by the reporting insurers for premiums ceded to or
         for losses recovered from other insurers because of the
         reinsurance ceded.

     g)  Correction of Errors

         Corrections of errors in the reporting of statistics
         shall be made by reporting the corrected data in the
         reporting quarter in which the error corrections are
         made.

     h)  Reporting Dates and Amounts

          1)  When reporting dates, use year and reporting
              quarter format (YYQ).

          2)  When reporting exposure, premium and loss amounts,
              all values shall be prefaced by a separate field
              for the sign ("+" = positive and "-" = negative).
              All numeric fields shall be right justified with
              leading zeros and contain all zeros if no amount is
              to be reported.

     i)  Reporting of Premiums

         The premium reported shall be the premium charged for
         the policies within each classification.  The premium
         for excess limits coverages shall be reported
         separately.  Premium for excess limits is defined as
         that premium charged for coverage in excess of the
         primary policy limits added by a different policy. For
         example, umbrella policy or through an endorsement to
         the policy.  Premiums shall be reported on both a
         written and earned basis.

     j)  Reporting of Exposures
         The number of written exposures shall be separately
         reported for each type or class of business required.
         If any reported exposure base differs from that
         prescribed by the Director, that exposure base shall be
         clearly defined.

     k)  Reporting of Losses

          1)  Separate fields shall be provided for both paid
              losses and outstanding losses.  Where required,
              fields shall be provided for paid allocated loss
              adjustment expense and outstanding allocated loss
              adjustment expense.

          2)  Special requests made by the Director pursuant to
              Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 73, par. 1065.904(D)
              shall contain detailed instructions for the
              submission, formatting and due dates of reports.

     l)  Reporting Excess Losses

         Losses covered by an excess policy shall be reported
         separately in the same manner as is described in
         subsection (k) of this Section. An excess loss is
         defined as a loss resulting in an incurred cost to the
         insurer in excess of the primary policy limits and
         covered by a different policy or an endorsement to the
         policy. For example:  umbrella policy or by an excess
         limits endorsement.

     m)  Definition of Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses
         Allocated loss adjustment expenses for the purpose of
         this Part represent the expenses of an insurer, in
         connection with claim settlements, that are directly
         allocated to a particular claim.

     n)  Three Year Prepaid Policies

         Premiums for three year prepaid policies shall be
         reported as three separate annual policies.

     o)  Other Prepaid Policies

         The procedures outlined in subsection (n) above apply to
         other policies not having a one year term with proper
         recognition of the policy term and using a pro rata
         allocation formula.  In all cases policy periods shall
         be annual or less.

     p)  Treatment of Installment Payments
         Premiums for policies written on an installment basis
         shall be reported as though they were prepaid policies.

     q)  Installment Charge Premium

         Additional premium resulting from the application of
         installment charges shall be reported as premium.

     r)  Divisible Package Policies

         Report premiums separately by each classification used
         in developing the total package premium.

     s)  Rounding Rule

         Rounding shall be accomplished by dropping 1 through 49
         cents, and by increasing and decreasing the dollar
         amount by 1 (depending on whether the amount is positive
         or negative) for 50 through 99 cents.

          2)  Diskettes shall conform to the recording procedure
		  contained in Section 6602.20.  Failure to comply with
		  these specifications shall subject the insurer to those
              penalties and procedures contained in Section 1204
              of the Illinois Insurance Code [215 ILCS 5/1204].

     b)  Guidelines for Data Collection

         Insurers are responsible for developing or obtaining any
         software required to convert and/or translate their
         internal file structures and formats to those prescribed
         by this Part.

     c)  Data Format Standards

         To simplify aspects of the data collection process, data
         and file formats for diskettes shall consist of common
         American Standard Code for Information Inter-Change
         hereafter (ASCII) representation.

     d)  File Description and Reporting Requirements

          1)  All amounts must be reported in whole dollars, with
              no reporting of cents.

          2)  Each line item required to be filed shall be a
              separate record.  Multiple records will be rejected
		  as edit errors and the entire filing will be returned
		  for correction.

          3)  The sign for all amount (numeric) fields shall be
              carried separately from the number.  The sign shall
              precede the number and shall be represented as
              positive (+) or negative (-).

          4)  All alpha and alphanumeric fields shall be
              left-justified.  Do not zero-fill blank characters.

          5)  All numeric fields shall be zero-filled and
              right-justified.

          6)  Fields which are not required for a line shall be
              zero-filled.

          7)  Rounding Rule - Rounding shall be accomplished by
              dropping, through 49 cents, and by increasing and
              decreasing the dollar amount by 1 (depending on
              whether the amount is positive or negative) for 50
              through 99 cents.

          8)  Filing Types - The initial filing is the first
              filing by an insurer for any of the three filings
              (February, August and November) for a year.  An
              amended filing is used when any portion of the
              initial filing was in error.  An amended filing
              must contain all information, not just the data
              that was in error.  A refiling is required when the
              insurer and/or software produced results that were
              not acceptable.  The refiling must contain all
              information required by this Part.  Refer to File
              Structures and Naming Conventions in subsection (h)
              and (i) of this Appendix.

          9)  Records due on February 1, August 1 and November 1,
              respectively, shall be submitted on separate
              diskette(s).

     e)  Diskette Size and Density

          1)  Diskette(s) submitted to the Illinois Department of
              Insurance shall be IBM compatible, 3-1/2 inch
              diskettes.  Diskette density shall be specified on the
		  external diskette label.  Diskettes will not be
		  returned.

          2)  The Department has developed and is making
              available an edit program for use on all PCs using
              DOS.  To request a copy of this program, contact
              the Illinois Department of Insurance Cost
              Containment Section.  Insurers shall run their
              ASCII file data against this edit program prior to
              submitting the diskette.

     f)  Insurer Responsibilities

         It is the responsibility of the insurer to meet all of
         the Illinois Department of Insurance guidelines for data
         submission.  The insurer shall be held accountable for 
         continued compatibility and compliance with the requirements
         of this Part.

     g)  Diskette File Structures and Naming Conventions

          1)  Each diskette submitted to the Illinois Department

<p>Hi, Ken Lee here with a wealth of information on how you can keep yourself safe, secure, 
and protected.  I'll give you tips about living safer -- in your home and on the road -- including common 
sense information, some surprising (and frightening) statistics, and security measures you can 
take.  I've also put together two safety related games.  The safer you live, the less chance you have of experiencing a loss, which means fewer claims filed, which means lower premiums for everyone.

<p>I guess you could call me the Frugal Gourmet of insurance, but the name's Paula Boyd.  
I'll dish out some great ways for you to save money on your auto and homeowners insurance.

<p>To begin with, there are lots of ways insurance companies will give you credit for being 
a policyholder.  I'll tell you about them, but keep in mind that not all companies give all 
the credits I'll mention.  And some credits may not be available in some states or may be 
slightly different from what I've described.  Talk to an independent agent to see which 
credits are available to you.

<p>Policy credits aren't the only way to save.  I'll tell you about other measures you can 
take -- from changing your deductible (the amount of money you agree to pay before your 
insurance kicks in) to fighting fraud.

<p>Hi, I'm Penny Herrington. As a personal lines product consultant, I receive a lot of comments from 
consumers. Most people are not always sure what's covered and what's not under their insurance 
policies. They know they need insurance, but they don't understand what they are buying.

<p>My job is to take the mystery out of insurance.  I'll do my best to simplify things so that 
you can become a better informed consumer.  I've put together mini-courses on some major 
personal insurance products, including Auto, Homeowners and Flood.  I've also found that the 
easiest way to understand what some insurance products will and won't cover is to use 
real-life examples.  These examples are a great way to test yourself on your new-found 
knowledge.

<p>

<p>Here's the full list of items I have to offer:<p>

Safety Tips for Your Business</h2>

<h3 align=left>
PROTECTING AGAINST THEFT</strong></h3>

<p>
No one likes to dwell on the unpleasant things that can happen to them.  But as a small business owner, you can't afford to close your eyes to the possibility of being burglarized.  If it happens, it can cost you hundreds -- even thousands of dollars.  You can't anticipate every possibility of theft, but by thinking and acting in the right ways, you can reduce your chances of being victimized.  Use our check list to help you evaluate and improve your security.

<ul>
<li>Depending on the size of your facility, issue IDs to your employees and check them daily.
<li>Check job applicants for credit references, police records and drug use.
<li>Number your office equipment for identification purposes and keep a record.
<li>If your facility is fairly large, require identification and log all visitors on and off the property.  Furnish visitors with passes and retrieve them when they leave.  
<li>Be alert to possible theft by delivery persons.  If feasible, have an employee accompany the delivery person at all times.
<li>Lights are a deterrent to both amateur and professional thieves.  Illuminate exterior doors and doorways and consider leaving the interior of your establishment lit after normal business hours.
<li>Use double cylinder deadlocks on your doors and check their working condition periodically.  
<li>Consider exterior door and window protection such as bars, screens, steel-lined doors, folding gates, roll-up grilles and others.  Don't overlook basement windows and skylights.
<li>If your business is subject to burglary, you may benefit from a local alarm system (sounds on the premises only) or a central alarm station (notifies a central station which sends someone to your premises and alerts police at the same time).  Consult an alarm system professional to help you determine what's right for your business.
<li>If the nature of your business makes armed robbery a possibility, teach employees how to protect themselves. Make sure they know what to do when danger has passed and whom to call. (Your local police department would be glad to advise you.)
</ul>

<h2>Claim Help</h2>



<h3>What should you do if you have an accident at your place of business?</h3>



<p align=center><img src="../images/box.gif" alt="">



<p>Almost every business will have a claim of some sort at some time.  Knowing what steps to follow when an accident or injury does occur can lower the overall cost of a claim. The following suggestions are aimed at helping you control your claim costs:



<h2>Handling a slip and fall injury:</h2>



<p>Conduct an initial investigation immediately following the report of an injury. The investigation should include an interview with both the injured party to establish the facts as known by them and with any other eyewitnesses to the accident. Key facts to gather include:



<ul>

<li>Time and location of the accident

<li>Physical condition of the area

<li>Complete description of the defect, obstruction or other condition that allegedly caused the fall

<li>Complete description of any guards, warning signs, roped-off areas or warnings of any other nature at the accident site

<li>Names and addresses of all injured parties

<li>Complete description of injuries and treatment given at the scene

<li>Names and addresses of all witnesses or bystanders on hand immediately before, during and after the accident.

</ul>



<h3>Other Tips:</h3>



<ul>

<li>Keep a camera handy at your place of business to take photos of any accident scene. If the accident was not witnessed, observe (when you can) whether the effects of a fall show on the injured party's clothing (e.g., dirt streaks or other marks, rips in clothing) or at the scene itself.</p>



<p><li>Report any and all accidents to management no matter how insignificant they seem. This allows for coordination and consistent handling and also ensures that the condition that caused the accident (e.g., crack in the asphalt, unattended shopping cart, wet floor) will be corrected immediately.</p>



<p><li>Help the injured person as best you can depending on the nature of the injury. Sometimes, to promote good will, it makes sense to offer the injured party a token item such as a free meal, a car wash, or a gift certificate.</p>

</ul>

<h2>COMPUTER COVERAGE ENDORSEMENT</h2>
<b>Your Business:</b>
<p>Eighty percent of small business owners use computers, and almost every business has some type of computer equipment, whether it's a stand-alone PC or a network system with dozens of users.  Many businesses rely on computerized cash registers, scanners, or control devices.  Software for word processing, billing, inventory, and shipping and receiving may also play a vital part in your business.  From mainframes to laptops, your hardware and software are valuable assets that need to be protected.<p>
<b>Some of Your Coverage Needs:</b>
<p>Special computer protection<p>
<em>The statements of coverage shown on this website are brief summaries and do not show policy exclusions.  All coverage is subject to policy terms and conditions.  For full details, see the policy itself.  Coverages may not be available in all states.</em>
<p>
<b>Computer Endorsement</b>
<br>This special endorsement can be added to your AE2000 business owners' policy to provide important protection for your valuable hardware and software.  This coverage features:

<h2>AUTO SERVICE BUSINESS<br> (EXCLUDING DEALERS)</h2>
<b>Your Business:</b><br>
As the owner of an auto service business, you have specific insurance needs that are very different from other businesses.  Whether your specialty is auto detailing, general automotive repair, sunroof or glass installation, oil and lube, rust proofing and undercoating, or emissions testing, you need special protection for your business.  Cars may be damaged or stolen while in your custody.  Customers or employees may be injured on your premises from slips, trips or falls, by bumping into equipment or from mishandling merchandise or chemicals.  Most businesses are becoming increasingly automated, and you may have extensive computer equipment and software for record-keeping, general office management, or auto analysis.   You also need coverage in the event of business interruption and may also need employee dishonesty coverage to protect you from the loss, forgery or alteration of checks and bills. <p>

<p><i>The statements of coverage shown on this website are brief summaries and do not show policy exclusions. All coverage is subject to policy terms and conditions. For full details, see the policy itself. Coverages may not be available in all states.</i>

<p><b><a name="pro">Property/Liability</a></b><br>
Our business owners' policy offers comprehensive property and liability coverage including coverage for damage to customers' property or injury to the public as a result of your operations.  The policy can provide coverage up to $5,000 per person for first-aid expenses, necessary ambulance and hospital expenses and other costs due to an injury arising from your operations.

<p><a href="#list">Return to List</a><p>
<b><a name="aut">Auto Service Endorsement</a></b>
<br>This endorsement is automatically attached to the basic business owners' policy and provides coverage for your property off-premises or in transit, and business income and extra expense coverage.

<p><a href="#list">Return to List</a><p>
<b><a name="gar">Garage Keepers' Insurance</a></b><br>
This endorsement covers damage that may occur to customers' cars while they are in your care, custody and control. 

<p><a href="#list">Return to List</a><p>
<b><a name="gla">Glass Coverage</a></b><br>
Window and sign glass coverage is automatically built in when your building is covered.

<p><a href="#list">Return to List</a><p>
<b><a name="too">Employees' Tools</a></b>
<br>You and your employees may own tools and equipment not only for daily automotive work, but also for maintaining your building and grounds.  Property such as lawn care equipment, parking lot sweepers, snow blowers, ladders, and miscellaneous tools are covered under your basic business owners' policy, but you can also choose to cover these items separately by purchasing a scheduled property policy.  Your agent can help you determine the type and amount of coverage that is right for your business.

<p><a href="#list">Return to List</a><p>
<b><a name="own">Owned or Leased Computer Hardware and Software</a></b><br>
Two optional endorsements provide $10,000 or $20,000 of basic hardware and software coverage, and cover laptop computers anywhere in the world.  We also offer a policy that provides up to $1 million in computer hardware and software coverage per location. We can help you select the amount of coverage that best fits your computer system.

<p><a href="#list">Return to List</a><p>
<b><a name="com">Auto Insurance</a></b><br>
Our Commercial Automobile policy insures your company vehicles against accident and theft.  This includes liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage to a third party. 

<p><a href="#list">Return to List</a><p>
<b><a name="wor">Workers' Compensation and Employers' Liability</a></b><br>
Our workers' compensation policy complies with all workers' compensation laws for providing coverage for injuries to your employees.  Our employers' liability coverage goes one step further.  It protects you from certain types of liability claims that can result from employee injuries, but that do not fall under workers' compensation laws.  

<p><a href="#list">Return to List</a><p>
<b><a name="lar">Large Lawsuit Protection (Umbrella)</a></b><br>
Any time you serve the public, you take the risk of being sued.  Our Commercial Umbrella policy gives you up to $5,000,000 of liability protection over and above the limits of the other policies in your business program.

<p><a href="#list">Return to List</a><p>
<b><a name="bus">Business Interruption (Business Income and Extra Expense)</a></b><br>
This coverage, which is included in the basic policy, helps you reopen your business in the event of an insured loss -- for example, if your building burned down, this coverage would pay for the cost to open your business in another location for 8 to 12 months, depending on the coverage you choose.  Not only does this cover the expense of opening and maintaining an alternate location, it also reimburses you for any reduction in business income or additional costs and expenses sustained as a result of the loss.

<p><a href="#list">Return to List</a><p>
<b><a name="emp">Employee Theft</a></b><br>
This optional coverage protects you from employee theft, a major source of loss for many businesses.  You can protect yourself with coverage amounts of $10,000, $25,000, $50,000, $100,000 or $150,000.

<p><a href="#list">Return to List</a><p>
<b><a name="mon">Money and Securities</a></b><br>
This covers your money and securities while in your place of business, at any banking location, while being conveyed by a messenger, or while in the home of that messenger.  Coverage in amounts up to $10,000 on premises and $2,000 off-premises are automatically provided on most policies, but you can increase these amounts up to $15,000 on premises and $13,000 off-premises with a special endorsement.

<p><a href="#list">Return to List</a><p>
<b><a name="add">Additional Multi-Coverage Protection Endorsements</a></b><br>
Our expansion endorsements offer you two ways to stretch your insurance protection.  Both are designed to complete your business owners' coverage package by providing additional amounts of insurance protection for your accounts receivable, fine arts, exterior signs, and more.  Ask your agent for more information.

<h2>BED & BREAKFAST</h2>
<p><b>Your Business</b>
<br>As the owner of a bed and breakfast, you have specific insurance needs that are very different from other businesses.  Guests may be injured on your premises due to slips and falls, by bumping into furnishings, or by tripping over carpets or uneven flooring in older establishments.  If your B&B is in a historic building, or if your accommodations feature  unique architectural details, you may need higher coverage limits in order to rebuild in the event of a fire.  Your B&B may also be furnished with valuable antique furniture, china, glassware or fine art, and these need to be protected.  Your guests may also be traveling with valuables or cash that may be lost or stolen.  Finally, your accounts, papers and billing records -- whether computerized or not -- need to be protected.<p>

<a name="burgler"> </a><h2>Business Owners Beware:<br>Look who could cost you your company!</h2>
<strong>By Phillip E. Norton</strong>

<p>It's the cruelest blow of all -- employee dishonesty.  Let's suppose you own a small and successful manufacturing company.  Harry, the head bookkeeper, is a loyal, trusted employee who is never out sick and rarely takes a vacation.  Unexpectedly, Harry undergoes surgery, requiring a lengthy period of recuperation.  While Harry is out on disability, a temporary accounting firm uncovers a phony payroll scheme that enabled the trusted and diligent Harry to embezzle more than $100,000.

<p>Too far-fetched? Not really! Unfortunately, employee dishonesty costs American business more money each year than fires.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that American businesses lose $50 billion a year to employee-related crimes.  Even more startling is the fact that the actual amount lost will never be known.  While more and more businesses are going public about employee theft, many businesses are loath to do so because of the negative publicity that may result.  And there is evidence that employee thefts and embezzlement schemes are on the rise.

<p>"In the past couple of years, the frequency of employee dishonesty claims among clients has increased," says Edmund Seibels, vice president of McGriff, Seibels & Williams, a 400-employee Birmingham, Ala., insurance agency doing business nationally.  "Maybe that's the result of rough economic times," he says, "but it certainly raised my awareness of the problem."

<p>Mike McClone of the McClone Agency, located on Lake Winnebago in Menasha, Wis., suspects there is more awareness of employee dishonesty today because it receives more news coverage.  "You read stories about the long-time employee who has been embezzling from the firm, and the employer just can't believe it," says McClone, a principal in the 25-year-old firm.

<p>Concurring is John Hampel, vice president of Marsh & McLennan's office in Atlanta.  "There are well-publicized cases where employee dishonesty caused the downfall of the company," he says.

<p><b>The enemy within</b>

<p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that one-third of all employees admit to stealing at least once during their employment.  Indeed, some 30 percent of all business failures are traced directly to employee theft.  The victims are usually small to medium-sized businesses with no outside shareholders to protect.

<p>Small businesses are often easy prey for embezzlers.  In most cases, the owner's focus is on building the business, not on examining every invoice or check that is written.  Smaller businesses are less likely to have in-house risk managers to spot exposures and more likely to have accounting departments without the proper checks and balances.

<p>Most employees are honest and dependable.  But there are exceptions.  "Most business owners believe that their employees can be trusted.  But those trusted folks are the very people who can steal because they've been given the keys to the vault," says Seibels.  He also believes that some companies that have reduced staff now combine certain accounting functions. "In larger companies, you have a division of duties.  Someone is directly responsible for checking those bank deposits.  Smaller companies may lack separation of accounting duties."

<p>Mike McClone adds that employee dishonesty generally happens over a period of time.  The schemes are known more for their longevity and severity, rather than for frequency, which is characteristic of other kinds of risk, such as fire.  "The principals in these companies can't believe that a trusted employee would devise a way to take a few hundred dollars each week," he says.

<p>Seibels  says, "People believe 'it can't happen to me.'" But it does, and that's created a special need among businesses that requires protection from employee dishonesty losses in the unfortunate circumstance of a breakdown in the internal control structure.

<p>Seibels' observations are confirmed by Phil Shafer, a 28-year veteran of our Bond Claim operation.  In handling employee dishonesty cases, Shafer frequently sees losses that exceed the fidelity bond limit.  "It is not unusual to see a $200,000 loss to the employer that is protected only by a $25,000 bond.  For a small business, that uncovered loss of $175,000 can be devastating," he says.

<p><b>A gap in coverage</b>

<p>While the U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates employee dishonesty costs businesses more than $50 billion a year, The Surety Association of America, a trade group of insurers, says its member companies had losses of $283 million for fraud and dishonesty in 1993.  That means that less than one percent of employee embezzlement losses were protected by a fidelity bond.

<p>Susan Drake, of our Bond's Commercial Risk market segment says, "Bond has always been in tune with the exposures a business owner faces from dishonest employees.  In the past three or four years, the number of fidelity bonds that Bond writes has grown by about ten percent a year.  There are two main reasons for this increase.  First is a growing awareness of the exposure by the producer and insured, and second, there's a realization on the part of first-time buyers that fidelity premiums are money well spent."

<p><b>Niche market emerges</b>

<p>Our small business endorsement Bond was introduced in 1993 as an enhancement to the AE2000 policy.  In addition to employee dishonesty, this offers coverage for excess money and securities, forgery or alteration, and pension and welfare fund fiduciary liability.  A client can select any one -- or all -- of four coverages, depending on their exposure.  The limits of the enhanced policy run from $10,000 to $150,000.

<p>"It is important that agents make clients aware of their fidelity exposures," says Drake.  "The 30,000 or so customers who have purchased this endorsement to date see a real need for the product and recognize that it provides a benefit to them at a reasonable price.  Even the best system of internal controls can break down and put business assets at risk.  Once people are pointed in the right direction, they recognize the value of a fidelity bond."

<h3>WHO STEALS, WHY AND HOW</h3>

<p>Any employee could be stealing an employer's assets. All it takes is:

<p>
<ul>
<li>Motivation: The employee with a real (or perceived) need for money to support a high lifestyle or an addiction to drinking, gambling or drugs;
<li>Opportunity: A loyal employee in a key position of trust; and,
<li>Rationalization: The worker who views stealing as borrowing money and fully intends to pay it back someday - but "someday" never comes.
</ul>

<p>Dishonest employees hatch devious schemes, such as padding payrolls and cash expenditures, and falsifying and altering time cards. Other plots involve billing goods at their real price, then entering a reduced price on the books and collecting the difference. They may also steal from the cash drawer, fail to enter cash sales or credit cash payment, and/or steal from incoming payments.<p>
Personal bookkeeping is a favorite ploy. For example, an employee may remove ledger sheets to hide shortages and keep a separate set of books.  Sometimes employees pay bills to fictitious firms, then cash company checks through a dummy account.  And some may even conspire with outsiders to fake a holdup.<p>
Employee dishonesty should be taken seriously.  According to a study by the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick, three out of four U.S. companies have been victims of fraud.  The most common types of fraud against businesses include check and credit card fraud, inventory theft and false invoices, with the average loss exceeding  $300,000.  This could cripple a small business.  The business owner's first line of defense should be a good system of internal controls.  But no system is perfect, and a fidelity bond with adequate limits can be a relatively inexpensive safety net.<p>
<b>Employee dishonesty -- a critical piece of the puzzle</b>
<p>Employee dishonesty coverage should not be treated as an afterthought.  The coverage is as important as property and casualty insurance.  For example, take a business that generates $2 million in annual revenues and has a net worth of $250,000.  The company is owned and managed by four siblings, each with a family to support.  They employ another 15 people, all with families of their own.  In total, more than 60 people depend on this business for their livelihood.<p>
The business pays $15,000 a year for property and casualty insurance, with varying limits between $1 million and $2 million, but decides not to spend an additional $1,000 for a $250,000 fidelity bond.  As luck would have it, one of their most trusted employees, like Harry the bookkeeper, has been systematically stealing from incoming customer payments for years.  By the time the scheme is uncovered, the business is on the brink of bankruptcy, and the owners are forced to lay off all the employees and dissolve the business.  For another 7 percent of insurance premium, they could have averted this tragic outcome.<p>

<a name="costs"> </a><h2>Controlling Costs </h2>
<br>What small business owners tend to want to know most about insurance is how they can 
control costs. </p>

<p>The best way is by preventing or controlling losses.  By stepping up loss control measures and 
cutting down on claims, a company can often reduce insurance premiums.  Installing sprinklers or 
security systems and conducting workplace safety programs are obvious - and effective - methods.  
But there are many less obvious ways a business owner can eliminate or reduce hazards to control 
losses, which an insurance agent or engineer can help identify. </p>

<p>A firm also can increase deductibles to reduce premiums.  A company with an excellent loss 
record, for instance, might want to increase deductibles and thereby take on greater risk.  The 
company should be sure, however, that it has adequate cash flow to cover the claims it will have to 
pay under the higher deductible. </p>

<p>Another potential cost-saving measure is a multi-year policy, in which the premium is set for 
several years, instead of one.  This option, which is not widely available, allows the owner of the 
firm to plan on a set premium for a number of years. </p>

<p>Finally, business owners should also look for low-cost or low interest payment plans for their 
insurance premiums. </p>
<p><a href="#index">Back To Index</a><p>

<a name="types"> </a><h2>Specific Issues Facing...</h2>

<p>Most businesses need some type of property, liability and auto insurance.  Many carry excess 
liability.  And most are required to carry workers' compensation.  But that's where the similarities 
end.  Each type of venture has specific issues it must address to maintain adequate insurance 
coverage. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Professionals </strong>  - They have to consider professional liability coverage and 
be aware that their liability has a long "tail" - meaning that it may extend many years into the 
future.  If a bridge collapses, for example, the engineer who designed it 25 years before might 
be sued.  Many professionals such as accountants and attorneys should carry errors and 
omissions coverage also called E&O - to protect against claims arising from errors or over-
sights.  For doctors and dentists, professional liability coverage in the form of malpractice 
insurance is a must.

<li><strong>Home-Based Businesses </strong> -  These businesses have insurance needs as well, 
but on a smaller scale than those of a traditional enterprise.  They should carry liability 
insurance for injuries to clients suffered on the property; business property coverage for 
inventory or equipment; computer coverage, if appropriate; and business auto coverage.  A 
homeowner's policy alone may not be adequate.  Home-based business owners can sometimes 
purchase an incidental business option rider on their homeowner's policy to cover their 
business exposures.

<li><strong>Restaurants </strong> -  Restaurant owners should have an insurance agent who 
understands their business and has written a number of restaurant policies.  A package policy 
specifically designed for restaurants will typically include coverage for the building and 
contents; general, liquor and product liability; window glass breakage; business interruption; 
crime insurance; and a boiler policy, which may cover food spoilage.  Workers' compensation 
and business auto would generally be written separately.

<li><strong>Merchants</strong>  - From the corner card shop to the high-rise department store, 
merchants have a wide range of insurance exposures.  They should look for a policy that 
covers their building and contents, signs and glass breakage.  In addition, they may want to 
add a peak season endorsement - in case the store burns the month before Christmas, for 
example - as well as business interruption protection.  General liability and product liability 
are also critical, as is adequate protection against crime, including employee theft and 
dishonesty.

<li><strong>Manufacturers</strong> -  The first concern of manufacturers is that their building 
and its contents be sufficiently protected.  Any assets not in the building (such as inventory 
stored at another location) or off-premises equipment also need to be protected.  Most 
manufacturers purchase business interruption insurance as well as extra expense coverage, 
which takes care of the extra expense that would be incurred in getting the business going 
again after a loss.  General and product liability coverage is also essential.

<li><strong>Construction Firms</strong> -  Construction is often a high-risk business.  
Construction contractors are best able to protect themselves through loss control measures and 
by transferring risk to another party, such as a subcontractor.  A contractor will probably want 
a builders' risk policy or an installation policy to cover property risks during the course of 
construction; general liability and umbrella liability; automobile and equipment coverage; and 
crime coverage.  Surety bonds may also be required.  Workers' compensation is likely to 
constitute a significant portion of the contractor's insurance premiums. 
</ul>

<h2>How to Buy Insurance</h2>

<p>Shopping for insurance isn't comparable to buying a new piece of equipment or a car.  First of 
all, you can't see it and second, you hope you'll never use it. </p>

<p>But because insurance is critical for a small business, you want to be sure you're buying the 
right insurance for your company. </p>

<p>If you're a franchisee, you may be able to buy insurance through your franchise organization at 
a reduced cost.  Or the franchiser may sponsor a program specifically tailored for your business.  
Trade associations, too, often offer insurance at a group discount. </p>

<p>The most prevalent method of buying insurance, however, is through an independent agent or 
broker, or through an exclusive agent.  Independent agents represent a variety of insurance 
companies, while exclusive agents work for just one. </p>

<p>Your insurance agent will analyze your business and its exposures, research coverage options, 
offer cost control advice and assist in the claims process.  In short, the agent is a key player in the 
insurance picture. </p>

<p>But how do you make sure you've chosen the right agent? </p>

<p>Other entrepreneurs are a good resource, as are trade groups, your local chamber of commerce 
and other professional organizations.  Look, in particular, for an agent who knows your industry.  
Some agents, for instance, handle primarily restaurants and know the exposures restaurants face 
and the coverages available.  Ask an agent for references, and then call them. </p>

<p>While agents will sometimes handle only commercial insurance or only life and health, try to 
keep all of your business with one agent or agency whenever possible. </p>

<p>You should select an agent or broker who works with strong, established insurance companies 
that have good claims records.  Insurance companies are rated by independent ratings agencies, 
and you should look for companies rated A- or better. </p>

<p>Also examine the agent's credentials.  Designations such as Chartered Property Casualty 
Underwriter (CPCU), Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC), Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU), 
Certified Insurance Counselor (CIC), Registered Health Underwriter (RHU) or Registered 
Employee Benefits Consultant (REOC) mean the agent has completed an intensive course of study 
in the field.  Agents who belong to trade groups and associations are more likely to keep their 
skills honed and their industry information up to date. </p>

<p>Once you've selected an agent or broker, be willing to invest the necessary time to work with 
that agent to come up with the proper coverage.  After you've received the policy, ask your agent 
to explain it to you in detail so you fully understand the parameters. </p>

<p>And don't let the relationship end there.  Keep your agent informed about any claims you file, 
or any developments in your business that may require a change in coverage. </p>

<h3 align=left>Accountants, Lawyers, Doctors, Nurses</h3>

<p>As a professional you have specific insurance needs that are very different from other businesses.  Your business is information-intensive, and this information -- accounts receivable, valuable papers and records, spreadsheets, worksheets and tax forms -- needs to be protected. If you are a medical professional, you may transport some medical equipment or supplies between your home and office, hospitals, clinics, or schools. These valuable materials require special coverage while being moved and while being stored in a location other than your own office.  In addition to this, most professional offices are becoming increasingly automated, and you may have extensive computer equipment and software for record-keeping and general office management. You also need coverage in the event of business interruption, and may also need employee dishonesty coverage to protect you from the loss, forgery or alteration of checks and bills.</p>

<h2>Retail and Wholesale Businesses</h2>

<h3 align=left>Stores, Warehouses, Grocers</h3>

<p>As a retailer or wholesaler, you have specific insurance needs that are very different from other businesses.  Customers may be injured on your premises due to slips, trips or falls, from bumping into displays, or from lifting heavy items or boxes.  As with all sales establishments, you face the risk of employee or customer theft.  Your business also has peak seasons -- typically the months leading up to Christmas and other holidays -- and you need extra protection should a loss occur at these busy times of year.  The computerized cash registers or other computer hardware and software used to run your business need protection, as well as valuable papers such as credit card receipts, or inventory, shipping and receiving records.</p>

<p align=left>
As the owner of a restaurant, you have specific insurance needs that are very different from other businesses. Fire and food poisoning are among the most severe types of losses you face, but slips and falls are the most common cause of injury to patrons. You should also be aware of the expense involved if you ever need to reopen after a fire or other damage to your building. Another thing to keep in mind is the Americans with Disabilities Act, which may require special reconstruction if you have to rebuild.</p>

<h2>Restaurant Coverage</h2>

<a name="prop-lia"><strong>Property/Liability</strong></a>
<br>
Our basic protection offers a choice of property and liability coverages specifically geared for your restaurant:
<ul>
<li>Building and business personal property, including your stock, appliances used for refrigerating, cooking or dish washing, fire extinguishing equipment, outdoor furniture, drive-through equipment, and playgrounds, are covered for loss due to fire, windstorm, water damage and many other causes of loss.

<p>
<li>In the event your restaurant closes due to damage from a covered loss, this policy will reimburse you for the resulting loss of income. Any additional expenses you incur to prevent or shorten the length of your shutdown are also covered.

<p>

Landlords</h2>

<h3>Apartments and Condominiums</h3>

<p>
As a landlord, you have specific insurance needs that are very different from other businesses. While fire is the greatest risk you face, slips and falls on your property are a common source of injury to residents and the public. You should also protect against damage to your property from theft or vandalism. Common property such as laundry rooms, tennis courts, or recreational facilities require special coverage, as well. Landlords may also be held responsible for injury to tenants from criminal activity if it is deemed they did not provide adequate safety precautions such as locks or extra lighting. Condo association directors and officers need protection should they be sued for mismanaging property or money. You should also consider the expense involved if you ever need to rebuild all or part of your complex after a fire or other damage, and bring it up to current handicapped-access standards.</p>

<i><b>"KEEPING-UP" WITH THE MANY SAFETY RULES CAN BE CHALLENGING </b></i><br>
The field of loss control and safety management is an ever changing, ever dynamic field. Every 
year, federal OSHA, EPA, DOT, CPSC, USDA, FDA, among other regulating agencies, and standards
organizations, such as NFPA and ANSI, identify annual agenda of safety priorities they plan to 
work on. Many of these items can affect your workplace... your people, your products, and your property. 
Every day, every week something new happens in the area of workplace safety and health... a new issue emerges, an old standard is amended. And, every year, the mass of rules and regulations may cause a surge of 
compliance questions. Today's safety manager, indeed, is challenged. We know that keeping up with 
the latest safety and health issues and rules, and controlling your loss exposures is a large responsibility.
We can help.

<P>

<i><b>WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF "KEEPING-UP" AND IMPLEMENTING THE RIGHT PROGRAMS </b></i><br>
We monitor standard-making activity and developments of a number of agencies dedicated to workplace
safety and health. We watch new and emerging issues and trends that could affect your loss experience.
We keep our network of safety and health specialists informed on safety issues and rule developments, including
rulemaking activity. We seek information and clarification, when appropriate, from state and federal 
regulating agencies and other safety organizations. Our safety specialists utilize new safety knowledge 
in the programs and services designed to meet your program needs. Our monitoring is available to you, too, and includes: 
<UL>

<LI><b>A monthly </b> <A  href="../topics/engp18.html">Engineering Issues Newsbrief</A>, which covers safety and health developments reported in publicly available media. This two-page brief objectively abstracts a number of "hot" and new developments each month which have the potential to affect your workplace loss experience and loss management programs.

<LI><b>A quarterly</b>, <A  href="../topics/engp17.html">Loss Control Topics &amp; Challenges,</A> which covers a range of hot topics and issues, including practical guidance and free resources for safety and health guidance on a range of subjects.  

<LI><b>Compliance consultation</b>, as part of our other safety services.

<LI>The opportunity to <A href="../topics/engp21.html">link</A> to some safety sites on the World Wide Web.</UL>

<b><i>PROPERTY DISASTERS HAPPEN... Even to companies who least expect them</i></b> 
<P>
<B><i>1990- Happy Land Social Club fire - New York</i></B> - One of the deadliest fires in recent history, 87 people die - property damage in the millions. 
<P>
<B><i>1991- Imperial Foods Processing Plant fire- North Carolina</i></B> - One of the deadliest fires in an industrial workplace in recent history- employees fatally trapped- property damage in the millions.

<B><i>1993- World Trade Center- explosion and fire- New York</i></B> - a city is paralyzed- many are injured - property damage in the millions.
<P>
Over 165,000 fires occur in businesses each year, resulting in well over $2 billion in loss to structures, equipment, raw materials, and finished goods, to say nothing of the loss to life. If you own, manage or lease property, you also know that property disasters could mean the cost of business interruption, lost production and possibly lost customers and markets.
<P>
<b><i>"BE PREPARED" is not just a Scout Motto... IT IS A CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR</i></b><br>
Fire/ life safety protection is as important as your marketing strategies. Both are investments in your
future. Our fire protection engineering specialists can survey your existing property and operations and recommend property controls to reduce your loss exposures. Some of our services include:
<UL>
<LI>Property risk assessment, hazard analysis, and written evaluations
<LI>Property loss control recommendations, including program development

<b><i>THE SINGLE LARGEST CATEGORY OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION INJURY</i></b><br>
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that cumulative trauma disorder (CTD), also known as repetitive
motion strain, is the single largest injury category driving workers' compensation costs in the United States. 
CTD also results in the longest absences from work. Carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, and back strain are 
among a few "CTD" disorders. These disorders translate into people and business costs. In addition to the 
impact on the physical well-being of employees, long absences may result in lost productivity and increased
workers' comp claim costs... all impacting your bottom line. 

<P>

<b><i>INSTIGATOR: IMBALANCE IN JOB TASK-DEMANDS AND THE HUMAN BODY</i></b><br>
When a job-task demands we use our body in a way that is not natural to its capabilities,
this can place "unnatural stresses" on body tissue, especially where the task is repetitive, prolonged,
and labor intensive. Demanding tasks are many, varied, and found virtually in every industry.
They also can result in injuries and disorders, including permanent disability.

<P>

<b><i>INTERVENTION: FITTING WORK TO HUMAN BODY CAPABILITIES</i></b><br>
Human Factors and Ergonomics is the science that focuses on the natural capabilities and limitations of the human body. It offers:
<UL>

<LI>A methodology for identifying job risk factors contributing to repetitive disorders  

<LI>Guidance for designing loss prevention strategies for work stations, machinery, tools, job processes, so that work better fits the capabilities and limitations of the human body

<LI>A risk management tool for mitigating the incidence and cost of repetitive disorders
</UL>

<p>

Our ergonomic specialists offer a range of services... from specific job task analysis and ergonomic interventions... to a comprehensive approach in designing a total ergonomic process as an integral part of your business operations. Our services include:
<UL>

<LI><STRONG> Ergonomic Process Implementation</STRONG><br>

<b><i>PROTECTING THEIR JOB-HEALTH... IS A SOUND ASSET-BASED INVESTMENT</i></b><br>
If your employees complain of headaches, itchy eyes, terrible odors... even if you think nothing's wrong... <STRONG>LISTEN</STRONG>. These could be signs of exposure of a specific toxic contaminant or of general poor air quality due to poor air ventilation and circulation. 

<P>

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has concluded that 53% of all sick building
syndrome-related complaints are the specific result of an inadequate or contaminated HVAC system. <A href="#airqual">Poor indoor air quality </A> <A NAME="return1"></A> is generally a minor problem. Depending on the <A href="#symptoms">symptoms</A> <A NAME="return2"></A>, minor adjustments to your ventilation and air circulation may resolve the problem. Or, in the extreme, you could, find yourself
contacting your state or local health department because of building-related Legionnaire's disease or histoplasmosis due to bacteria or fungi. 

<p>

<b><i>YOU ARE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT TO MANAGE WORKER HEALTH... and We Can help.</i></b><BR> 
Whatever the potential workplace health exposure- whether poor indoor air, lead, radiation, heat stress,  a confined space, noise, bloodborne pathogens, tuberculosis, toxic chemicals or minerals, to name a few, ... the health and safety of your employees is important. It affects personal lives and business productivity. It affects your workers' compensation experience... and, ultimately, your profits.  We can help:
<br>
<ul>

<H3>What are some of the causes of poor air quality?</H3>

<DL>

<DT><B>Indoor Air Pollutants:</B>
<DD>Asbestos from insulation and fire-retarding building supplies; formaldahyde from
pressed wood products, carpeting, and other finishing materials; air fresheners; paints,
adhesives; copying machines; fumigants, and bioaerosols.

<DT><B>Outdoor Sources:</B>
<DD>Pollen, dust, microbial aerosols, industrial pollutants, and vehicle exhaust.

<DT><B>Building Ventilation Systems:</B>
<DD>Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in
sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor air and by not carrying indoor
air pollutants outside.

<DT><B>Use of Buildings in Unanticipated Ways:</B> 
<DD>A building intended for one purpose is converted for another use. If not properly
modified during renovations, the ventilation systems can contribute to poor air quality.

</DL>

<P>

<H3>What are some health effects of poor air quality?</h3>

<DL>

<DT><b>Indoor Air Pollution (IAP):</b> 
<DD>Generally considered to be when an irritant is present, and perhaps concentrated, in 
the building. Inadequate ventilation and circulation rates prevent removal or dilution of 
these annoyances.

<DT><b>Sick Building Syndrome (SBS):</b> 
<DD>Generally characterized by non-specific respiratory complaints, such as a cold or 
flu. Usually results from and inadequate outdoor air supply and/or heating, ventilation, 
and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.

<DT><b>Building-Related Illnesses (BRI):</b> 
<DD>Clinically diagnosed illnesses caused by specific microorganisms, with Legionnaire's 
Disease and Pontiac Fever the most recognized examples.

</DL>
<P>

<br><br><br>
<br><hr><br>

<A NAME="symptoms"></A>

<H2>Specific symptoms suggest loss control actions you can take</H2>

<DL>

<DT><b>Thermal Discomfort</b>

<DD><b>Suggestion:</b> Check HVAC condition and measure temperature and humidity. Also check for 
drafts and stagnant areas.

<DT><b>Headache, lethargy, nausea, drowsiness, dizziness</b>

<DD><b>Suggestion:</b> In onset was acute, arrange for medical evaluation, because carbon monoxide 
poisoning my be the problem.

<DT><b>Congestion, swelling, itching or irritation of eyes, nose, or throat; dry 
throat or nonspecific symptoms.</b>

<DD><b>Suggestion:</b> May be allergy if small number of people affected. If many people are 
affected, look for sources of irritating chemicals, bio contamination, dirty HVAC system.

<DT><b>Cough, shortness of breath; fever; chills, and/or fatigue</b>

<DD><b>Suggestion:</b> Check for gross microbial contamination due to sanitation problems, water 
damage, or contaminated HVAC system.

<DT><b>Diagnosed Infection</b>

<DD><b>Suggestion:</b> May be Legionnaire's Disease or histoplasmosis, related to bacteria or 
fungi. Contact the state or local health department.

address your loss exposures and potential liabilities. This analysis and strategic action planning is part of the "continuous improvement" philosophy and mission of quality organizations.
<P>
<i><b>CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PLANNING RESTS ON GOOD DATA</i></b><br>
Good company data is important in understanding your risk exposures and your loss costs. The understanding derived from an analysis of your loss data, in turn, can be used to design safety and health programs for your workers, your processes, your products, your property... in order to better manage your loss potential and experience.
<P>
<i><b>"CARMA ON-LINE" IS AVAILABLE TO HELP YOU</i></b><br>

<b><I>IMMEDIATE INJURY INTERVENTION ... COMPASSION AND CARE... <br>All are Key to Your Workers' Compensation Loss Cost Experience</i></b><br>
When injured workers don't understand what to expect after a workplace injury and don't get the help or answers they need from their company management, they may feel the need to turn to an attorney for help. When they do, this can have an adverse affect on your workers' compensation loss experience.
<P>
<b><i>YOU ARE IN A POSITION TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE</i></b><br>
Many companies say that a post-injury management program, where injured employees are treated like partners... with respect, compassion, and care... can result in a significant decrease in attorney involvement and workers' compensation costs. It also boosts employee morale and productivity. 
<P>
<b><i>INTEGRATED INJURY MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS... <br>We can help to get you there</i></b><br>
Our injury management consultants can help you build partnerships with injured employees and medical providers through an integrated injury management approach. We can work with you to help you customize post injury management options to fit your specific business operations and company policies and programs. Our customized program services include:
<UL>
<LI>On-site situational assessment
<LI>Design of a post injury system
<LI>Designation of an injury coordinator and supervisor training
<LI>Employee communication strategies related to injury management 
<LI>System support through a helpline network
<LI>Design and implementation of transitional duty and other return-to-work programs
<LI>Development of a medical provider network, with a "sports medicine" philosophy
</UL>
<P>
<b><i>RETURN TO WORK PROGRAMS... FROM GROUND ZERO... TO FINE-TUNING</i></b><br>
Our injury management consultants also can help enhance an existing return to work program or work with you to design one from ground zero.
<p>
<b><i>MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORKS: FORGING QUALITY ALLIANCES</i></b><br>
Quality of medical care can greatly influence medical outcomes. Our injury management
consultants can evaluate the level of care available through existing providers, identify those providers who incorporate a "sports medicine" philosophy in treating work-related injuries, and provide an action plan to 
help you create business partnerships with key providers.

<p><br>

<EM><STRONG>... WE ALSO KNOW THE HIGH COST TO BUSINESS... IF THINGS GO WRONG</EM></STRONG><br>
Product defects, alterations, misuse, contamination, tampering... improper installation or repair: 
Every year, many different products are the targets of recalls or claims for bodily injury or property damage. 
Legal liability may arise around issues of defect in design, manufacture, and/or warnings and 
instructions. Manufacturers, sellers, distributors, importers may become the targets 
of a claim or lawsuit, whether or not the product is actually found to be defective. 
And, defective or not, the annual costs associated with such claims is staggering!
<P>
<EM><STRONG>A "PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE" APPROACH TO PRODUCT SAFETY &amp; QUALITY ASSURANCE</EM></STRONG><br>
We know how important it is to you to deliver safety and quality in your products. We also know how 
important it is to you to minimize your products loss potential. And, we can help. Our Product Safety 
Specialists have the skills, knowledge, and experience to help you identify and understand the current safety 
and liability issues associated with your product and its uses. We use a product <em><strong>
life cycle</em></strong> approach to help you address issues associated with your 
product at each of its life cycle stages, from pre-production, through production and post-production, 
including addressing processes, procedures, and recordkeeping, among other things. We can help you:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Identify potential hazards as they uniquely apply to your products
<LI>Understand <em><strong>life cycle</em></em> stages, including design, testing, disposal
<LI>Establish controls to help minimize loss potential and loss consts  
<LI>Establish a recordkeeping procedure to faciliate claim investigations and defense
</UL>
<P>
<EM><STRONG>YOUR REPUTATION IS ONE OF YOUR GREATEST ASSETS... PROTECT IT</EM></STRONG><br>
Product liability claims can be costly to you... not only in dollars, but also in terms of your credibility,
reputation... and public confidence. To help you minimize your potential product liability and 
loss exposures, our product safety specialists offer a number of services, including:
<P><UL>
<LI>Product Life Cycle Risk Assessment
<LI>Product Recall Plan Review

<UL>
<LI>proper packaging and vehicle placarding
<LI>hazardous materials training, including emergency response
<LI>hazard communication requirements.
</UL>

<P>

<p>Hi, I'm Penny Herrington. As a personal lines product consultant, I receive a lot of comments from 
consumers. Most people are not always sure what's covered and what's not under their insurance 
policies. They know they need insurance, but they don't understand what they are buying.

<p>My job is to take the mystery out of insurance.  I'll do my best to simplify things so that 
you can become a better informed consumer.  I've put together mini-courses on some major 
personal insurance products, including Auto, Homeowners and Flood.  I've also found that the 
easiest way to understand what some insurance products will and won't cover is to use 
real-life examples.  These examples are a great way to test yourself on your new-found 
knowledge.

<p>Do you have enough insurance to replace your home in case the unthinkable happened? For the typical homeowner, the answer unfortunately is <b>NO</b>. We're not talking about your home's market value here, we're talking about your ability to replace it. Unlike market value, which may drop, hold steady or rise, the cost to replace your home continues to climb. Why? Because material and labor costs are always going up. Also, if building codes and materials have changed since your home was built, rebuilding to new code (and with newer materials) could be more costly.

<p>As an aid to homeowners everywhere, Travelers has teamed up with E.H. Boeckh&#153; (a nationally acclaimed building cost consulting firm) to offer the Estimator tool. Completing this exercise will let you see if you have enough protection to replace the dwelling structures on your property (referred to as Coverage A in your  Homeowners policy). This is the amount of insurance that would be available to replace or rebuild your home and attached structures (like a garage, porch or pool enclosure). (If you're still not clear on the coverages available under your Homeowners policy, check out our <a href="./home101.html">Homeowners 101 course</a>.)

<p>Please remember, the intent of this tool is to give you a general estimate of the cost to replace specific types of construction. This is not a substitute for a detailed appraisal or a quantity survey where more specific detail and data are required.

<p>To begin, simply select one of the methods described below:

<p><em>We recommend use of the Netscape Navigator version 1.1 or higher in order to maximize your enjoyment of this tool. We can not guarantee the performance or quality of the tool with other Web browsers. If you would like to get a copy of the Netscape Navigator, it's available at <a href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape's Web site</a>.</em>
<br>
<br clear=all>

<p><b><a href="./squarefoot.html">The Square Foot Method</a></b> is the preferred industry standard when calculating replacement costs. It's more exact because it's based on the actual square footage of your home, thereby allowing less room for error. However, in order for this method to be accurate, you need to know and provide the exact square foot measurement of your home, as well as any additions. If this information is not readily available, we suggest you try the Unit Count Method.

<p><b><a href="unitcount.html">The Unit Count Method</a></b> is the quicker, easier option. You are asked to provide general information, including the number and types of rooms, additions, and items that are part of your home. It'll give you a rough idea of your home's replacement cost: it's more like a ballpark estimate. If you are looking for a more exact calculation, and if you know your home's square footage, you should try the Square Foot Method.

<p>Hi, Ken Lee here with a wealth of information on how you can keep yourself safe, secure, 
and protected.  I'll give you tips about living safer -- in your home and on the road -- including common 
sense information, some surprising (and frightening) statistics, and security measures you can 
take.  I've also put together two safety related games.  The safer you live, the less chance you have of experiencing a loss, which means fewer claims filed, which means lower premiums for everyone.

<p>I guess you could call me the Frugal Gourmet of insurance, but the name's Paula Boyd.  
I'll dish out some great ways for you to save money on your auto and homeowners insurance.

<p>To begin with, there are lots of ways insurance companies will give you credit for being 
a policyholder.  I'll tell you about them, but keep in mind that not all companies give all 
the credits I'll mention.  And some credits may not be available in some states or may be 
slightly different from what I've described.  Talk to an independent agent to see which 
credits are available to you.

<p>Policy credits aren't the only way to save.  I'll tell you about other measures you can 
take -- from changing your deductible (the amount of money you agree to pay before your 
insurance kicks in) to fighting fraud.

<h3>
Statement Of Understanding
</h3>

<p>
There is a standard 30-day waiting period for new applications 
and endorsements increasing coverage. The effective date of the 
new policy will be 12:01 a.m. local time on the 30th calendar 
day following the application and <b>premium payment date</b>. 
The exception is for insurance purchased as a condition for a 
mortgage loan or the revision of a flood map. If a policy is 
required for the closing of a loan, flood insurance is effective 
on the date of the closing. In the event of a map revision, the 
effective date will be 12:01 a.m. local time, following the day 
after the application date and the presentment of premium. Any 
changes to the information provided above may result in a change 
in premium. A company representative will contact me about the 
premium amount and payment method.

<h3>
Statement Of Understanding
</h3>

<p>
There is a standard 30-day waiting period for new applications 
and endorsements increasing coverage. The effective date of the 
new policy will be 12:01 a.m. local time on the 30th calendar 
day following the application and <b>premium payment date</b>. 
The exception is for insurance purchased as a condition for a 
mortgage loan or the revision of a flood map. If a policy is 
required for the closing of a loan, flood insurance is effective 
on the date of the closing. In the event of a map revision, the 
effective date will be 12:01 a.m. local time, following the day 
after the application date and the presentment of premium. Any 
changes to the information provided above may result in a change 
in premium. A company representative will contact me about the 
premium amount and payment method.

<p>Do you have enough insurance to replace your home in case the unthinkable happened? For the typical homeowner, the answer unfortunately is <b>NO</b>. We're not talking about your home's market value here, we're talking about your ability to replace it. Unlike market value, which may drop, hold steady or rise, the cost to replace your home continues to climb. Why? Because material and labor costs are always going up. Also, if building codes and materials have changed since your home was built, rebuilding to new code (and with newer materials) could be more costly.

<p>As an aid to homeowners everywhere, Travelers has teamed up with E.H. Boeckh&#153; (a nationally acclaimed building cost consulting firm) to offer the Estimator tool. Completing this exercise will let you see if you have enough protection to replace the dwelling structures on your property (referred to as Coverage A in your  Homeowners policy). This is the amount of insurance that would be available to replace or rebuild your home and attached structures (like a garage, porch or pool enclosure). (If you're still not clear on the coverages available under your Homeowners policy, check out our <a href="./home101.html">Homeowners 101 course</a>.)

<p>Please remember, the intent of this tool is to give you a general estimate of the cost to replace specific types of construction. This is not a substitute for a detailed appraisal or a quantity survey where more specific detail and data are required.

<p>To begin, simply select one of the methods described below:

<p><em>We recommend use of the Netscape Navigator version 1.1 or higher in order to maximize your enjoyment of this tool. We can not guarantee the performance or quality of the tool with other Web browsers. If you would like to get a copy of the Netscape Navigator, it's available at <a href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape's Web site</a>.</em>
<br>
<br clear=all>

<p><b><a href="./squarefoot.html">The Square Foot Method</a></b> is the preferred industry standard when calculating replacement costs. It's more exact because it's based on the actual square footage of your home, thereby allowing less room for error. However, in order for this method to be accurate, you need to know and provide the exact square foot measurement of your home, as well as any additions. If this information is not readily available, we suggest you try the Unit Count Method.

<p><b><a href="unitcount.html">The Unit Count Method</a></b> is the quicker, easier option. You are asked to provide general information, including the number and types of rooms, additions, and items that are part of your home. It'll give you a rough idea of your home's replacement cost: it's more like a ballpark estimate. If you are looking for a more exact calculation, and if you know your home's square footage, you should try the Square Foot Method.

<p>As I said, the unit count method is the easier option to use.  However, please remember that your estimate will be a ballpark, rough idea of your home's replacement cost. For a more accurate estimate, you should use the Square Foot method. To obtain your estimate, fill in the information below then press the "calculate now" button.

<p><b><em>NOTE</em></b>: The intent of the <b>Travelers Estimator - Unit Count Method</b> is to furnish the user with a guide for making general estimates of costs to replace specific types of construction. This guide is not to be construed as a substitute for a detailed appraisal or a quantity survey where more specific detail and data are required.

<h1>January 1996 </h1><br></ul><hr size=1 noshade><p><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/q.gif"> <ul>
 <p>I live in the recently battered and snow covered Northeast.
 The blizzard of 1996 continues to wreak havoc on our home and
 our neighborhood. For the first time since we've lived here, water
 trapped by the snow on our roof has leaked into our home. Our
 ceiling and walls are a mess. We consider ourselves lucky though...
 neighbors down the street had their roof collapse from the weight 
 of the snow! Is any of this covered by Homeowners insurance? -- Ken, Massachusetts.
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <P><b>Ken, Massachusetts. Re: Coverage for damages from
 recent blizzard?</a></b>
 <p>As a fellow New Englander, I know what you're going through. The
 effects of the blizzard are still being felt by many homeowners
 such as yourself. Luckily, this is just the type of unexpected
 situation for which you purchase Homeowners insurance. Most Homeowner
 policies have an all-risk feature, which states that unless a
 hazard is specifically excluded, you're covered. If your policy
 offers this higher level of all-risk protection, the damages you
 described are in fact covered.
 <P>First, let's discuss the coverage provided for your leakage damage.
 Your Homeowners policy should pay to repair or replace your damaged
 ceiling and walls. That includes the cost to install new sheetrock,
 paint and finish the ceiling, and repaint or re-paper the walls.
 Wall-to-wall rugs that might have been damaged are also covered.
 All this would first be subject to your Homeowners deductible.
 <P>Another important fact you should know is that basic all-risk
 Homeowners protection is only offered for the actual building
 and structure. Unless you have purchased a separate add-on coverage
 providing all-risk protection for your home's contents, your damaged
 personal possessions are not covered under these conditions.
 <P>Roof collapse is considered to have broader coverage than water
 damage/leakage. Your neighbors should receive coverage for all
 direct physical losses to their covered property <B>and</B> possessions.
 <P>If you haven't done so already, please contact your local independent
 insurance agency to notify them of your situation. I'm sure that
 your agent will be able to help you file a claim and settle your
 loss, as well as answer any other questions you might have.
 <P>Also, Ken's <a href="/market/travelers/html/safe/safesecu.html">
 Safe and Secure section</a> has some helpful safety
 tips on preparing for and surviving winter storms. Good luck.
 
 </ul><hr size=1 noshade><p><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/q.gif"> <ul>
 <p>I've noticed that you keep including statements to contact
 &quot;your local independent insurance agent.&quot; However, I
 know my agent is very busy... I don't want to bother her over every
 little thing. When should I <I><B>really</B></I> contact my agent? -- 
 Debbie, Kentucky.
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <b>Debbie, Kentucky. Re: When to call an agent?</b>
 <p>
 First of all, Debbie, your agent is in business to answer all
 your questions and concerns about insurance and is probably happy
 to help no matter how small your concern. It's your agent's job
 to be there for you, so please don't think that you're bothering
 anyone. As they say: there's no such thing as a stupid question,
 except the one not asked.
 <P>
 Generally, when something significant about your home, your car
 or your possessions changes, you should let your agent know. For
 example, if you add an addition or do major renovations to your
 home, you should call your agent so that your Homeowners coverage
 will include these additional investments. Let's say your home
 has $150,000 of <a href="/market/travelers/html/covered/coverage.html">Coverage
 A</a> (the cost to replace your home's
 structure should disaster strike). If a $20,000 add-on sunroom
 is not reported, you might not have enough to cover the costs
 to rebuild your home to its updated condition.
 <P>
 Also, certain high-ticket items (such as jewelry, computer equipment
 and artwork) are normally scheduled (or listed) on your policy.
 Often there are limits established on these items that can be
 increased. For example, the basic Homeowners policy usually allows
 about $1,000 for jewelry, but this limit can be raised for a small
 fee. Therefore, a new diamond engagement ring (worth $4,000),
 would exceed the basic limit on jewelry if it was stolen. By making
 your agent aware of this new possession, she could then recommend
 increasing the jewelry limits on your Homeowners policy. Or she
 might recommend you purchase a separate Valuable Items policy
 since other jewelry pieces might bring your totals beyond what
 can be covered under your Homeowners policy.
 <P>
 Agents should also be contacted when you purchase a new car, boat
 or other recreational vehicle. In some cases, limited coverage
 for small boats and recreational vehicles can be added to your
 Homeowners policy. Your agent can help you determine what works
 best for your needs.
 <P>
 Finally, some lifestyle changes can also create a reason for a
 call. A marriage or birth may prompt a review of your life insurance
 needs. Your agent can also help you determine the kinds of coverage
 needs you might have when you start a new business. The bottom
 line is that your agent is in business to make sure you have the
 protection you need. By being aware of the significant changes
 in your life, she will be better able to help you determine what
 coverages, if any, are needed.

 <p>What sort of insurance is available for my computer? --
 Justin, Oklahoma.<br><br><br>
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <b>Justin, Oklahoma. Re: Insurance coverage for computers?</b>
 <P>Hi Justin. Most homeowners insurance policies do offer protection
 for your home computer, but you must understand that this coverage
 is limited. Since computers are considered to be part of your
 home's contents (called <a href="/market/travelers/html/covered/coverage.html">C
 overage C</a>), coverage is only offered
 if your computer is destroyed or damaged by specified perils (like
 fire or theft). That means that if your computer is accidentally
 dropped or knocked over, you are not covered. You're also limited
 by the total amount purchased for your home's contents and are
 subject to a deductible.
 <P>Often, this basic coverage just isn't enough, especially if you
 have an expensive, state-of-the-art computer with other related
 equipment and associated software. Most insurance companies, however,
 do offer comprehensive, low-cost add-on coverage for home computers.
 These riders offer all-risk protection (which covers most situations except wear
  and tear and gradual deterioration) and can provide up to $10,000 in extra cove
 rage. In other words, if your computer is dropped or knocked over, or if it's da
 maged by a power surge or failure, you're covered! There's also no deductible re
 quired.
 <P>Justin, if you think you might need extra protection for your
 computer and related equipment/software, I'd recommend that you
 contact your local insurance agent. Your agent can work with you
 to determine the value of your equipment and related software.
 <P>
 Finally, if you own a small business and own computer equipment for that
 business, check out the information in our Small Business site for
 <a href="/marketplace/travelers/smallbiz/html/computer.html">protecting your
 computer equipment</a>.

 <p>Will my Homeowners/renters policy cover the belongings
 of my roommate, or for that matter, anyone else living with me? -- 
 Emma, Washington.
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <P>This is an excellent question, Emma. Unfortunately there aren't
 any easy answers. Most policies will only cover the belongings
 of the person (including spouse and children) in whose name the
 policy is purchased. These policies do not cover, and therefore
 will not pay for, losses suffered by uninsured roommates. You
 might suggest that your roommate purchase a separate, low-cost
 renter's policy to protect his or her own possessions.
 <P>In cases where you are not dealing with a &quot;traditional&quot;
 roommate arrangement, you might want to contact your agent. Perhaps
 your agent can suggest insurance options available to safeguard
 domestic partners.

 I've been an admirer of your site since it came up, you've got a lot of cool 
 stuff here! I've heard that there's been some sort of merger with Travelers. 
 What's going to happen to your site?--Tracy, Indiana 
 <p>
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <b>Tracy, Indiana</b>
 <p>
 The short answer, Tracy, is that this site won't change very much; in fact,
 we're looking to expand! We launched a 
 <a href="/marketplace/travelers/smallbiz/">small business </a> site this
 month and we've got some others in the works. We plan to take this opportunity 
 to provide even more services to you, the Internet consumer. As you know, 
 Aetna's Property/Casualty business has been sold to the Travelers Group. 
 However, you'll continue to see the same great service and the same informative content on the 'net. The only difference is that our company name will change. 
 With a purely Property/Casualty focus, we feel we can do an even better
 job of developing valuable material for families and businesses. 
 Penny, Ken, Paula and I (as well as the rest of out Internet Team) look forward to serving those needs in the future.

 My boat's engine wouldn't start the other day, so I took it to a shop to see

 Is this covered by my Boat insurance?  --Paul, Virginia 
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <P>
 <b>Paul, Virginia</b>
 <p>
 No Paul, your Boat insurance policy will not pay to overhaul your engine.  
 Unless your engine was damaged by a covered peril (such as lightning, storm 
 damage, vandalism) the cost to overhaul it is not covered.  Remember that wear 
 and tear is not a covered condition.  Insurance should not be confused with a 
 maintenance contract.  Insurance is only meant to offer protection in case of 
 accidental or catastrophic circumstances.

 My 12 foot inflatable tender (also called a Dinghy) with a 9 horsepower outboard
  motor (a total value worth $3,000) was stolen off my yacht last night.  I have
 Yacht insurance.  Am I covered?  If so, for how much?  --David, Rhode Island
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <P>
 <b>David, Rhode Island</b><p> 
 Well David, you're in luck!  Most insurance companies provide coverage for 
 dinghies under their basic Yacht policy (as long as they are under 16 feet and 
 less than 25 h.p.).  However, the amount of compensation you receive for your 
 loss depends on your policy.  For example, some companies 
 (including Travelers) offer lower deductibles (usually around $100) for this 
 kind of loss.  That means you will receive a check for $2,900.  However, other 
 insurance companies require that you pay the entire hull deductible (usually 
 1% of the cost of your yacht).  Obviously, if you have to pay the higher 
 deductible, you'll have to absorb more of the loss.

 I sit on the board of directors for a local non-profit agency.  It's a totally 
 voluntary position; I do not receive any compensation for my labors.  
 Unfortunately, times being what they are, employee layoffs are coming.  
 I've heard stories of other similar organizations (and their board members) 
 being sued by disgruntled workers.  Am I at risk?  Will my Excess Liability 
 policy provide coverage?  --Alan, Ohio
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <P>
 <b>Alan, Ohio</b><P>
 Great question, Alan!  Yes, your Excess Liability policy will cover you under 
 the situation you just described.  However, you might want to find out if your 
 organization has purchased Directors and Officers Liability coverage (the 
 insurance name for this is D&O).  D&O is special liability coverage that would 
 protect the entire Board in such instances.  Your Excess Liability would only 
 offer you individual protection.
 <p align=left>
 If the Board has D&O insurance in place, here's how things would work:  
 D&O would be treated as the primary insurance.  Your Excess Liability would 
 be a secondary coverage which would cover your legal costs and award judgments 
 that go over the limit provided by the all primary insurance (including D&O).
 <p align=left>
 Because there might still be confusion as to what Excess Liability might cover,
 here's another common example.  A lot of parents voluntarily serve on local 
 Parent Teacher Organizations or Associations.  Let's say private funds were 
 raised to add a playscape (slides, tunnels, climbing ropes, rubber tires, the 
 whole deal) to the school playground.  A number of parents might also have 
 volunteered to help construct the structure.  If a child was later injured while playing on the playscape, the parents and/or the organization might be sued.  
 In such cases, Excess Liability would also provide the needed individual 
 protection.

 I'm currently looking to buy a condominium.  Before I take on the 
 responsibilities and debts associated with home ownership, I thought 
 I'd better find out some information on insurance for condos.  I've been 
 told that most condo associations already have insurance coverage in place.  
 Does that mean I don't have to buy insurance for my unit?  
 --Samantha, Pennsylvania 
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul><P>
 <b>Samantha, Pennsylvania</b><p>
 Well Samantha, condominium owners need to think about insurance protection as 
 two pieces of the same pie.  One piece is called a Master Policy and is 
 purchased by the condominium association.  The Master Policy covers shared 
 property and common areas (like tennis courts, swimming pools, even the 
 actual building structure of the condo unit).  However, the Master Policy  
 <b><em>does not cover</em> </b> your personal property or legal responsibility.  That's where the second piece of the pie is needed.
 <p align=left>
 In order to complete your protection, you should seriously consider Condominium
 Owners Insurance.  This type of policy insures your furniture, clothing and 
 personal possessions (up to the limit purchased) against such hazards as fire, 
 lightning, windstorm, hail and vandalism.  Condo insurance also gives you 
 peace-of-mind liability protection.  You're covered for lawsuits and claims by 
 others for personal injury or property damage caused by you, members of your 
 family/household, or hazards on your property for which you are legally liable.
 <p align=left>
 The basic Condo Insurance policy also provides:
 <ul>
 <p align=left>
 <li><b>Theft protection:</b> worldwide protection against practically every type
  of theft loss.  That includes possessions that are stolen from a car.
 <p align=left>
 <li><b>Additional Living Expenses:</b> If your unit is damaged and you have to 
 move out while it's being repaired, you're covered.  The policy pays for 
 necessary living expenses (hotel, meals, laundry, etc.).
 <p>
 <li><b>Additions and Alterations:</b> You may be responsible for insuring 
 interior parts of your unit according to your condominium declaration and/or 
 bylaws. Condo insurance offers $2,500 of coverage on items which make up your 
 home (like window glass, walls and doors), if you are responsible for insuring 
 them. Additions, alterations and other improvements made to your unit are also 
 covered.
   <p>
 <li><b>Loss Assessment Coverage:</b>  Most condominium policies offer $1,000 for
  loss assessments.  This gives you protection against financial loss if damage 
 to commonly owned property exceeds the amount in the Master Policy.  If your 
 condo association is forced to assess all unit owners for the additional loss 
 (or for personal liability claims against the association), you're covered!

<h1>November 1995 </h1><br></ul><hr size=1 noshade><p><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/q.gif"> <ul>
 <P>I own a trail bike and go tooling around with friends on weekends.  I also 
 have what's called an Umbrella policy which protects me from all sorts of 
 legal responsibilities. Someone recently told me that trail bikes are not 
 covered under my policy.  I thought my policy covers me under every 
 circumstance.  After all, isn't that what an umbrella's for!  --Pete, Michigan 
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <b>Pete, Michigan</b>
 <p>Sorry to say Pete, but trail bikes are excluded in many Umbrella (also known
 as Excess Liability) policies.  In fact, the only Recreational Vehicles that are
  allowed are snowmobiles and golf carts.  Unfortunately, there's a lot of 
 confusion over what this policy covers.  Most people find out the hard way, 
 after something terrible happens.
 <p>As you know, Excess Liability increases your "umbrella" of liability 
 protection into the millions and it covers a huge range of circumstances.  In 
 fact, unless something is specifically excluded, it's covered under the 
 policy.  I suggest that you review your policy, especially the section on 
 exclusions.  Another option is to check out the
  <A HREF="../html/covered/excess.html">Excess Liability Insurance 101</A> section 
 that provides a clear explanation of the way this policy works, as well as 
 some policy benefits and exclusions.  Your local independent agent is also a 
 great resource and can help you with your coverage concerns.

 <P>I own a valuable stamp collection that's recently been appraised at over 
 $10,000.  I insured the collection with a Valuable Items insurance policy, 
 but after learning about how Homeowners insurance doesn't cover flood damage, I'm extremely confused.  If my home is flooded, is my collection covered or 
 not?  --Mary, Tennessee 
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <b>Mary, Tennessee</b>
 <p>
 Yes, Mary, you are covered.  A Valuable Items policy offers comprehensive 
 coverage for all sorts of perils, including fire, accidental breakage <em>
 and flood</em>!  Most Homeowner and Flood policies place limits on the amount 
 you can receive for the loss of valuab le possessions.  Since you've 
 safeguarded your stamp collection with a Valuable Items policy, you'd receive 
 full compensation in the event of such a loss.
 
 </ul><hr size=1 noshade><p><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/q.gif"> <ul>
 <P>I just bought a 22-foot runabout that I keep at Lake Winnipesaukee.  
 Can you tell me if this boat is covered under my Homeowners policy?  
 Or do I need special insurance?  I find this whole issue very confusing.  
 --Bob, New Hampshire 
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <b>Bob, New Hampshire</b>
 <p>
 Well Bob, you're not alone.  A lot of boat owners are confused by the limited 
 boat coverage that is available under the Homeowners policy.  The basic 
 Homeowners policy provides about $1,000 of physical damage protection for 
 small boats.  There's also an endorsement (add-on coverage to the Homeowners 
 policy) that offers <EM>some</EM> increased protection for boats under 26-feet
 in length and not over 15 years old .  also an endorsement (add-on coverage to 
 the Homeowners policy) that offers <EM>s ome</EM> increased protection for 
 boats under 26-feet in length and not over 15 years old .  the Travelers 
 Watercraft Hull Coverage endorsement, for example, offers up to $7 ,500 
 (in most states) for covered losses to your hull, furnishings, attached 
 equipment and trailer.  Insurance.  Your independent agent can help you 
 determine which option works best for you.  Also, check out next month's Are 
 You Covered site.  Penny Herrington is developing a number of articles on Boat 
 and Yacht insurance that should help clarify the many benefits and features of 
 these policies.

 <P>Please settle a debate that I'm having with my neighbor.  I own and 
 operate a <b>small business</b> from my home. I say that my business is 
 covered under my Homeowners Insurance,but my neighber disagrees.  Who is right?
 --Jill, Ohio.
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <b>Jill, Ohio:</b>
 <br>
 You both are.  Your Homeowners insurance will cover a <em>small</em> amount of 
 business property (up to $2,500), but in most cases, that's just <b> not enough 
 protection </B>!  You really need to consider some additional options.
 <P>
 your low-cost alternative is a special endorsement (add-on coverage to 
 your Homeowners policy) designed to meet the needs of business owners who 
 work out of their homes.  This Home Business Endorsement covers <b>all</b> 
 of the business property in your home, as well as business property away from 
 home (up to $10,000).
 <P>
 Plus, with this coverage you get additional protection for your business -- 
 protection that most business owners have to acquire through more expensive 
 commercial policies.  For example, you are covered for loss of income and 
 extra expenses that happen after a home loss (for up to 12 months).  You also 
 receive additional protection for general, product and advertising liability.  
 Check with your l ocal independent insurance agent for more specifics on this 
 program.
 <P>
 While we're on the subject, people who work out of their homes but are employed
 by someone else might want to check with their employers to see if the business
 equipment they use at home is insured by their company.  If not, they might want
  to consider expanding their Homeowners coverage.  There is now available an end
 orsement that lets these individuals increase the limits of coverage on business
  property in their homes.  For just pennies a day, they'll get coverage for all
 their business property, including portable cellular phones and protection for 
 damage to property belonging to others.  And, your local insurance agent can 
 help you determine what's best for your needs.
 <P>
 Travelers has a new Home Business Endorsement that's currently available in 
 Maryland, Connecticut, Illinois and Ohio.  I suggest you contact your local 
 independent insurance agent to see if you qualify for this new, important 
 coverage.

 <P>I've been fortunate not to have ever been involved in an auto accident.  
 However, as a former boy scout, I like to be prepared!  Just in case, <b>

 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <b>Alec, Georgia.</b>
 <br>
 Hopefully Alex, you'll never need to use this information.  But since you've 
 asked, here's what we recommend you do in the event of a traffic accident:
 <p>
 <dl>
 <dt><B>Help any injured parties first.</B>
 <dd>  Have someone call the police or highway patrol.  (Try to provide emergency
  folks with as much information as possible so that they can respond promptly 
 with medical support.)  While waiting for assistance, try to provide the 
 injured with whatever comfort is possible, but avoid moving them so that you 
 don't aggravate their injuries.  (Your scout training will come in handy here!)
 <p>
 <dt><B>Collect information.</B>
 <dd> Get names, addresses, license plate numbers of persons/vehicles involved, 
 including witnesses.  Do not discuss the accident with anyone except the police 
 or your insurance company.
 <p>
 <dt><B>Call the Police.</B>
 <dd>  Even if no one is hurt, the police should be involved if damage is 
 extensive or in case of theft.  In case of a "hit-and-run," you must report 
 the accident to the police as soon as possible (within 24 hours).  After 
 you've provided the police with the data they require, ask the investigating 
 officer where you can obtain a copy of the police report.  This report will 
 help support any claim submitted to your insurance company.
 <p>
 <dt><B>Protect the accident scene.</B>
 <dd>  Try to protect your car and property from further damage by setting 
 up flares.  Some states require that you get your car off the road so as not 
 to tie up  traffic, or cause additional accidents.  Other states don't want 
 you to move any cars until the police arrive so they can easily reconstruct 
 the accident and assign responsibility.  I suggest you call your local police 
 or Department of Motor Vehicles to determine which law is in effect in your 
 state.
 <p>
 <dt><B>Call your insurance company.</B>
 <dd>  Put your insurance to work by filing your claim as soon as possible.  Your
  agent or insurance company will let you know what information it needs and how
 to proceed with your claim.  Keep records of your expenses and copies of all 
 paperwork.

 <P>I don't own a house, <b>I rent</b> an apartment in the City.  Do I need 
 Homeowners insurance?  -- Marie, New York.
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <b>Marie, New York</b>
 <p>
 While you do not need Homeowners coverage Marie, as a renter you still need to 
 protect yourself and your personal belongings.  Many insurers offer a low cost 
 Renters Insurance policy that protects your furniture and personal possessions 
 against damage or theft (at home or away).
   <P>
 In addition to your possessions, Renters Insurance also provides financial 
 protection in case you are sued.  We can't always guarantee that our personal 
 activities (especially while playing most sports), children, pets or apartment 
 conditions won't cause accidents.  This way, if you accidentally hurt someone 
 or if you damage their property, you're covered.  Now, if stuff happens, you can breathe alittle easier because of this valuable Renters liability protection!
 <P>
 Also, if you're forced out of your apartment due to a covered hazard (
 such as a fire), your insurance will cover additional living expenses 
 (hotel, meals, laundry, etc.) while your damaged apartment is being repaired.
 <P>
 s you can see, Renters Insurance is a low cost way to achieve peace of mind and
  needed protection.  The beauty of Renters insurance is that it's very flexible
 to fit the many varying needs of renters.  Your local independent insurance 
 agent can help customize this coverage for you.

 Well Hector, although I'd like to say that our writers have been flexing their 
 overactive imaginations, we didn't just make up these FAQ's.  Travelers has 
 a long history of communicating with and responding to our customers.  
 We actually receive many questions through our more traditional interactions 
 with customers (800 numbers, claims processing, etc.).  What you see here are 
 some of the most commonly asked questions that we hear.  And now, with 
 this on-line service, we're getting the opportunity to communicate and respond 
 even faster.  Thanks for your question and feel free to contact me again through our Let's Talk e-mail capability.

 <P>My sister was recently involved in an auto accident -- her car was struck 
 when another vehicle ran through a red light.  Since the accident was clearly 
 not her fault, my sister wants to file a <b> third-party claim </b> directly 
 with the other driver's insurer.  I think her insurance company should handle 
 this, what if something goes wrong?  What should she do?  -- Deirdre, Colorado 
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <b>Deirdre, Colorado:</b><P>
 f the other driver is clearly at fault (you probably need corroboration from 
 the other driver, witnesses and/or police), a third-party claim would be a 
 very reasonable course for your sister (or her agent) to take.  In cases 
 such as these, third-party claims are quicker and more efficient.
 <P>
 By dealing with only one company, you eliminate all the extra time, effort, and
 resources that would have to be spent had your insurance company also become 
 involved.  Just think of the duplication of effort:  two adjusters, two claims 
 processers, two lawyers.  By eliminating the "middle men" you save your 
 insurance company time and money, which ultimately helps to keep auto 
 insurance rates down.
 <P>
 Your sister should contact her agent or insurance company to notify them of the
 accident and of her plans to pursue this type of claim.  This way, her agent and
  insurer have the facts on file and can intervene on her behalf if such actions
 prove necessary.

 <br>
 That's part of it, Joe.  In general, if you're a city dweller, your premiums may
  be higher than those of people who live in the suburbs or rural areas, because
 statistically, you are more likely to have an accident in city traffic.  But, th

  under the age of 25 are involved in more than one-third of all auto accidents a
 nd traffic fatalities.  Young females have fewer accidents than young males.  An
 d married couples have fewer losses than single people.  The way insurance compa
 nies price insurance reflects some of these facts.
 <P>
 There's also what we call "vehicle use" (how you use your car).  A car used for
 personal use (called a "pleasure" vehicle) will generally cost less to insure be
 cause it is less likely to be involved in an accident than a car driven to work
 and back.
 <P>
 The kind of car you drive makes a difference, too.  Higher-priced cars usually c
 ost more to repair than lower-priced ones.  Some models are more likely to be st
 olen, and certain models are involved in more accidents -- and more expensive ac
 cidents -- than others.  All of this is also taken into consideration when prici
 ng insurance.
 <P>
 Finally, there's the matter of your driving record.  If you have a history of "a
 t fault" accidents and moving traffic violations, you can expect your premiums t
 o be significantly higher than average because statistically, you're more likely
  to have future accidents.
 <P>

 pful.  By the way, for ways to save money on your insurance, hop on over to Paul

 <P>Last year I bought my first home and have been very concerned about making sure I have the right insurance.  I thought everything that's in my house is covered by my <STRONG>homeowners policy</STRONG>, but my father tells me that's not true.  Is he right? -- Ann, California.
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul> 
 <b>Ann, California:</B><br>
 Well, it depends, Ann.  There are some things homeowners policies generally don'
 t cover or there may be limits on the amount of coverage provided on certain typ
 es of things.  For example, some jewelry and valuable items are not included, or
  they may have coverage limits.  And most people don't know, for instance, that
 flood insurance is not included in their basic homeowners policy.
 <P>
 If you have jewelry and valuables, Ann, or if you live in an area where your hom
 e could be flooded, I would recommend that you review your homeowners policy wit
 h an independent agent to see if you need additional coverage or endorsements.

 <P>The economy has really hurt the value of my home.  From 1991 through 1994 its market value fell every year.  At the same time, my <STRONG>homeowners insurance premiums</STRONG> have continued to rise.  It's going to be a while before I can hope to sell my home and recoup my investment.  I understand that.  But, what's the story on my insurance? -- Ray, Connecticut.
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <b>Ray, Connecticut:</B>
 <br>
 You're not alone, Ray.  Many people believe their homeowners insurance coverage
 is based on their home's market value.  So, when their annual policy renewal arr
 ives in the mail, they can't understand why their insurance premium has increase
 d while the market value of their home has either decreased or remained stable.
 <P>
 In fact, your homeowners premium is not based on your home's market value.  It's
  based on your home's estimated replacement cost.  This is an important differen
 ce.
 <P>
 Ray, if your home were completely destroyed, you would want your insurance to co
 ver the cost of rebuilding or replacing your home, wouldn't you?  In today's eco
 nomy, a home's replacement cost is often higher than its market value.
 <P>
 Market value is the estimated price at which you could sell your home in today's
  market.  Replacement cost is the estimated cost of reconstructing your home.  R
 eplacement cost includes labor, materials, overhead, profit, permits, taxes and
 other fees, most of which continue to increase in cost every year.
 <P>
 Both market value and replacement cost are affected by economic conditions.  But
  market value is affected by the demand for housing, while replacement value is
 affected by the cost of materials and labor.  Market value conditions may be on
 a downward swing in some areas, while costs for labor and materials are increasi
 ng.  Those increases drive up replacement cost.  For example, as a result of Hur
 ricane Andrew, the cost of lumber has increased significantly, affecting replace
 ment costs nationwide.
 <P>
 Each year, Travelers upgrades the estimated replacement cost of your home based
 on current costs for labor and materials, to ensure you are fully covered (up to
  the limits outlined in your policy) in the event of a complete loss of your hom
 e.
 <P>
 If you have any questions about the amount of insurance you have on your home, b
 e sure to talk with an independent insurance agent.
 
 </ul><hr size=1 noshade><p><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/q.gif"> <ul>
 <P>A few years ago my husband and I bought a house near a small river.  The <STRONG>river has flooded</STRONG> in the past, though not since I've lived here.  Recently, a friend who was visiting told us we'd been lucky and urged us to get special flood insurance before there is a problem.  Aren't floods covered by my homeowners policy? -- Jean, Florida.
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <b>Jean, Florida:</B>
 <br>
 No, Jean, not the type of flood you're talking about.  If your home was flooded
 or had water damage that was caused by pelting rains or broken pipes, for exampl
 e, your policy would cover some or all of the damage. But basic homeowners polic
 ies don't cover flooding from rivers.  People in places like the Midwest, Califo
 rnia, Texas, and Louisiana have learned this the hard way.
 <P>
 And the federal government will not automatically bail flooded homeowners out wi
 th disaster loans either.  First, a community must be declared a federal disaste
 r area and even then federal disaster assistance may not happen.  This type of a
 ssistance has been awarded in less than 50 percent of flooding incidents.  Addit
 ionally, after an area has received federal assistance, it will not be eligible
 for assistance in the event of future floods.
 <P>
 Besides, the average cost of a flood insurance policy is almost always less expe
 nsive than paying off a federal disaster loan.  And getting flood insurance for
 your home is easy.  Talk to an independent agent for all the details -- but do i
 t soon!  There's a 30-day waiting period after you purchase a flood policy befor
 e the coverage is effective.
 
 </ul><hr size=1 noshade><p><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/q.gif"> <ul>
 <P>Recently I had to travel on business and I <STRONG>rented a car</STRONG> for the trip.  At the rental agency, they asked me if I wanted to purchase a Collision Damage Waiver as part of the rental package.  I thought my own auto insurance probably covered the rental car, so I decided not to buy the waiver.  But later, I worried about whether I was at risk.  Was I? -- Gwen, Ohio.
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <b>Gwen, Ohio:</B>
 <br>
 Many customers have asked this same question, Gwen.  And no, you were not at ris
 k if you have an Travelers auto policy in most states (as long as your travel wa
 s within the U.S., its possessions and territories, or in Canada).  But let me e
 xplain a bit about Collision Damage Waivers.
 <P>
 This waiver is not insurance.  It's a release from financial liability if you da
 mage the rental car.  That means that, for a fee, the rental car company will no
 t hold you legally responsible for damage to the car.
 <P>
 When you sign a rental contract, you agree to be legally responsible for damage
 up to the amount stated on the contract.  Generally speaking, your auto policy w
 ill cover you if you rent a car or passenger van (other vehicles may need specif
 ic protection available from the rental company), but if you're not insured with
  Travelers, check with your agent to be sure.  Also, your policy may cover you o
 nly in certain geographic locations.
 <P>
 By the way, ever wonder why you can't rent a car if you don't have a major credi
 t card?  Most rental agencies require your credit card number so the amount of d
 amage can be immediately charged to your credit card.  Then you'll get reimburse
 d by your insurance company.
 
 </ul><hr size=1 noshade><p><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/q.gif"> <ul>
 <P>I've noticed that Travelers makes a big deal about working with <STRONG>independent agents</STRONG>.  What's so special about independent agents? -- Ralph, Maryland.
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <b>Ralph, Maryland:</B>
 <br>
 Basically there are three ways insurance companies sell their products, Ralph.
 Some companies have their own agents who only sell that company's products.  Oth
 ers, like Travelers, sell their products through independent agents who represen
 t many companies. And finally, there are a few that sell their products using 80
 0-numbers so consumers can talk directly with a sales representative of the comp
 any.
 <P>
 From the consumer's point of view, independent agents mean choice.  If you talk
 with a telephone sales rep, or an agent who works exclusively for just one insur
 ance company, you'll be talking with someone who's job is to sell you their comp
 any's product.  An independent agent, on the other hand, represents many compani
 es and works with you to help you find the insurance company that best meets you
 r needs.  In the end, it's your choice to make.

 <P>My grandfather died last month and left me his collection of <STRONG>antique duck decoys</STRONG>, which are now proudly on display in my house. I have no idea what they're worth, but plan to have them appraised soon.  I'm wondering if my homeowners policy covers them and if not, what should I do? - Ted, Minnesota.
 </ul><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/family/images/a.gif"><ul>
 <b>Ted, Minnesota:</B>
 <br>
 An unusual, valuable collection like this may be limited in coverage, Ted.  Most
  homeowners policies have limitations on how much they'll cover (like $1,000 wor
 th of jewelry) and may cover only some of your home's contents -- not the very u
 nique.
 <P>
 Most insurance companies, however, offer coverage for valuable items which can b
 e purchased separately.  In fact, Travelers has one especially for decoys!

<h2>You don't have to be a millionaire to be sued like one!</h2>

So.  You are a fine upstanding citizen with a spouse, children, home, car and a dog.  Naturally you have Homeowners and Automobile insurance policies to protect you, your family and your possessions.  You feel secure knowing that in the event of some terrible situation where you are sued, you're covered.  Well, think again.

<P>Homeowners Insurance provides a minimum of $100,000 liability coverage (the coverage that protects you when people are injured or property is damaged due to circumstances in which you or your family are responsible).  Although it varies widely by state, the typical minimum liability protection for Auto Insurance is around $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident.  Let's face it, in most situations, this is just not enough protection.

<P>With both of these coverages you can purchase higher limits (or amounts) of liability protection...but the most that can be purchased is $500,000 for Homeowners policies or $250,000 per person, $500,000 per accident for Auto insurance.  Again, this may not be enough protection in today's lawsuit frenzied environment where million dollar judgments are fast becoming the rule rather than the exception, even for seemingly minor situations.

<P>The more your earning power and assets increase, the more you have at risk, and therefore, the more you need to protect.  If you don't have high enough coverage limits, your assets might be sold or your income might be garnished (a portion of your future earnings would be contributed) until your debt is paid.  There's an old saying that's appropriate here:  "He who has the deeper pockets pays!"

<P>If you think you need at least a million dollars of additional protection above your current Homeowners or Automobile liability limits, you can purchase something called Excess Liability.  To understand more about what this coverage is, and how it can help you, please review the following topics:

<h3>What is Excess Liability?</h3>
<P>
Often referred to as an umbrella policy, Excess Liability is the additional protection you need in case a judgment against you exceeds the liability limits of 
your existing Auto or Homeowners policy.  Available in amounts ranging from one to five 
million dollars, Excess Liability coverage increases your personal liability limits by adding 
protection to your current Auto, Boat or Homeowners policies.  Also, if something is not 
covered in your Homeowners policy (like libel), and it's not specifically excluded in the Excess 
Liability policy, you're covered.
<P>
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A name="benefits"></A>
<h3>Coverage Provided</h3>
<P>
Excess Liability coverage provides:
<UL>
<LI>protection for covered claims by others for personal injury or property damage caused by 
you, members of your family/household, or hazards on your property for which you are 
legally liable.
<LI>personal liability coverage for occurrences on or off your premises.
<LI>an additional layer of protection above your primary Auto policy against auto-related 
liabilities.
<LI>protection against non-business related personal injury liabilities such as slander, libel, 
wrongful eviction or false arrest.
<LI>legal defense costs for a covered loss.  Lawyer fees and associated court costs are 
covered.
<LI>World wide coverage.  You are covered around the globe, no matter where you go.  The 
only exception is for situations involving foreign ownership of dwellings or cars.  If you travel 
and rent, you're covered.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A name="works"></A>
<h3>How it works</h3>
Depending on the type of accident, your Homeowners, Auto or Boat policy liability limits are 
used up first, then the Excess Liability policy covers all remaining costs (up to the amounts of 
coverage you purchased).  For example, if your neighbor dove into your swimming pool and 
broke his neck, your Homeowners liability coverage would pay for the first $100,000 in 
damages.  Your Excess Liability policy would cover the rest (including associated legal fees) up 
to the one million dollar policy amount that you had purchased.
<P>
Most companies require that you carry certain limits on your primary insurance policies 
(Homeowners, Auto and Boat) in order to receive Excess Liability Coverage.  For example, 
a company may require the following primary liability limits:  $100,000 for Homeowners, $250,000 per 
person/$500,000 per accident for Auto and $300,000 for Boat/Yacht coverage.
<P>
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A name="definitions"></A>
<h3>Some Definitions</h3>
I know that insurance products tend to get loaded down with legal-sounding jargon, especially a 
product that specifically deals with circumstances for which you are legally responsible.  
Therefore, a few common definitions might help clear up any confusion:
<P>
<B>Personal Liability:</B>  Coverage for damages that you are legally liable (responsible) for.  This 
includes incidents occurring at your home and/or caused by you, residents of your household or 
your pets.  Here are some common examples: your dog bites someone, a guest falls down your 
front steps, your teenage son rough-houses with his buddy and accidentally breaks that friend's 
leg!
<P>
<B>Personal Injury:</B>  This all-inclusive definition covers many predicaments.  Personal injury can 
take many forms, including:  bodily injury, shock, emotional distress, mental anguish, sickness or 
disease, or death arising from any of the above.  Personal injury also means false arrest, 
detention or imprisonment, malicious prosecution, wrongful entry or eviction, humiliation, libel or 
slander, defamation of character or invasion of privacy.
<P>
<B>Property Damage:</B>  Accidental damage to the property of others caused by you, residents of 
your household, or your pets.
<P>
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A name="exclusions"></A>
<h3>Exclusions</h3>
Often, insurance policies are defined not by what they cover, but by what they don't.  This is 
especially true for Excess Liability products.  If something is not specifically excluded, you're 
covered.  Exclusions vary widely by company.  Here are some common exclusions:
<P><UL>
<LI>damages expected or intended by insured.
<LI>damages arising out of business or professional pursuits.
<LI>liability assumed under contract or agreement.
<LI>liability arising out of ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of aircraft.
<LI>liability arising out of ownership, maintenance or use of non-traditional watercraft such as jet skis, air boats or air cushions.
<LI>liability arising out of ownership, maintenance or use of most recreational vehicles.  Only snowmobiles and golf carts are covered.
<LI>damages to property you take care of, own or use.
<LI>damages covered under a Workman's Compensation policy.
<LI>liability arising out of war or insurrection.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A name="howmuch"></A>
<h3>How much is enough?</h3>
Obviously, determining how much coverage is right for you is a personal decision.  Much 
depends on the value of the current assets you have to protect.  However, there are also other 
factors to take into consideration.  What will the value of your future assets be?  Are you 
involved in activities that put you at greater risk?  Do you have teenagers?  Do they drive?  
Your local independent agent can help you determine the coverage amount that works best for 
you.
<P>
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A name="credits"></A>
<h3>Cost-saving Credits</h3>
Cost-saving credits are available in most states if your car, home or boat is already insured with 
the same insurance company.  Additionally, some companies are beginning to 
offer an endorsement (add-on coverage) to existing Homeowner policies that increases your 
liability limits to the millions!  Your independent agent can help you determine whether this 
endorsement is available, as well as help you determine the best money-saving coverages 
available.

<h3>Integration Objectives</h3>
<p>
Pete Bothwell, head of Personal Automobile has established one very simple objective for the integration effort:  "<i>make the transition as smooth as we can for our agents and insureds</i>". Charged with making this happen is Tom Gruber, Auto Integration Team Leader.
<p>
In order to achieve this goal, Gruber has identified three key elements.  First, we must minimize customer disruption as much as possible as a result of pricing and underwriting changes.  Second, we need to test before we implement and finally, we must constantly and consistently communicate with our agents and our customers through out the integration.
<p>
Communications is critical to our success.  As such, both <a href="mailto:peter_t_bothwell@travelers.com">Bothwell</a> and <a href="mailto:tom_gruber@travelers.com">Gruber</a> have internet email accounts for agents and customers to submit questions, comments and concerns about the integration process.
<p>
<a href="#top">[top of page]</a>
<p>
<a name="indiana"></a>   
<hr>
<h3>Indiana Pilot</h3>
<p>
One of the critical success factors for integration was to test before we implement.  As such, Indiana was selected as a pilot state.  The Indiana Pilot is moving toward an August 26, 1996 implementation.   In Indiana we are moving the Aetna Auto Program (AAP) business to Travelers programs,  policy forms and systems.  To help make this process less disruptive for the customer, we are introducing a new, Highly Preferred Program to the Travelers Product Line.  AAP Tier 1 and 2 business will be moved to the new Highly Preferred Program at annual anniversary.  Tier 3-4 policies will be moved to the Phoenix Preferred Program and Tiers 5-8 will move to the Travelers Indemnity - Standard Program.
<p>
We will underwrite the business in the Aetna Casualty and Surety Company using our current AAP program rules. If we decide to non renew a policy, it will be handled using our current - AAP - procedures and forms.  If we decide to renew, the policy will be "lifted and loaded" into the proper new program based on the renewal tier.
<p>
Travelers customers will be handled using current Travelers procedures.  The entire process will appear to be a normal rate change at renewal  (with a few coverage enhancements) for the Travelers customers.  Like the Aetna customers, we will apply the new rates and Coverages at the annual anniversary.
<p>
The new Highly Preferred Program will be opened to new business on August 26th.

<h3>Indiana Prototype Begins Conversions August 27, 1996</h3>
<p>
Beginning on August 27, 1996, we began the conversion of automobile business from the Aetna Insurance Company to the newly created Travelers products and programs in the state of Indiana.   All business with an Indiana rating address will be converted to one of three automobile programs  - a Highly Preferred Program written in the Travco Insurance Company, a Preferred Program written in the Phoenix Insurance Company, or a Standard Program written in the Travelers Indemnity Company.  These three programs, plus a special program called EDGE, will form the foundation of The Travelers automobile rating programs in Indiana and will be similar in most other states in the U.S. 
<p>
Policies are being converted on their annual anniversary and will take the new rates, rules and coverages that were filed for these new programs.   To help our agents and customers, we are calling our agents on renewals that may experience a rate increase of 10% or more.  While these are anticipated to be few, it will help us help our customers and allow us to determine if there are any errors or changes that could be causing such an increase.  Corrections can then be made before the policy goes out to the customer.  We will be building a reporting and correction process into our countrywide conversion procedure that will allow this "advanced look" and correction opportunity on all policies.
<p>
<a href="#top">[Top of Page]</a>
<a name="changes"></a>
<p><br><p>
<h3>Exciting New Coverages and Rule Changes to Be Implemented</h3>
<p>
As part of our integration efforts, we want to make sure that we have competitive rates and excellent coverage options which stand out from the competition.  To this end, we are working on introducing such coverages as Loan - Lease Gap Coverage and Waiver of Deductible for NonOwned Automobiles as part of our new Traveler Auto product enhancements.  New rule changes in many states will allow us to "forgive" the first at fault accident for our good long term customers.  New credits will be introduced in most states which will provide rate reductions for long term customers who have a good driving record.
<p>
Combined, we will be capitalizing on the best of both companies to bring our agents and customers a great product at a very competitive price.

<h3>Finding the Right Car</h3>

<P>As with any major purchase, you need to check out all of your options.  I suggest you visit some dealerships and search for the car of your dreams.  Or, if you don't feel like doing all that leg-work, a number of car companies (including GM's Saturn, Ford, Chrysler, Volkswagen and Toyota) are offering sites on the Net for you to visit.  It's now possible to flip through electronic brochures full of facts and figures, photos and prices in the comfort of your own home.  Once you've selected some candidates, take a test drive.  That should help narrow the field even more.

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>
 
<A name="research"></A>
<h3>A Little Research Goes A Long Way!</h3>

<P>Once you're down to the two or three vehicles that best fit your needs, I strongly urge you to research the actual cost of these cars (as opposed to the dealer's or manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price).  In other words, try to find out the cost that the manufacturer charges the dealer.  You'd be surprised by the mark up that is built into some vehicles.

<P>Obtaining this information isn't as hard as you think.  Most automobile clubs (as well as some popular consumer magazines) offer this information for a nominal fee.  I believe I paid about $18 dollars for the first car printout, and about $6 for information on each additional car.  Be sure to ask for a breakdown of the various options so you can determine if a package of options is better than selecting them individually.

<P>The printouts I received listed the base price of each car, followed by all of the options.  One column provided the manufacturer's cost of each item.  Right next to this first column was another corresponding column offering the dealer asking price (the ever popular sticker price).  Since the prices were listed next to each other, it's easy to see which items have a higher mark up and which are fairly valued.

<P>I went through the actual cost column and added up the base price of each car with all of the options I wanted.  (Don't forget to consider some of the options that can help you reduce your insurance bill, like air bags, anti-lock brakes and security features.  Ken Lee's Safe & Secure section offers tips on <A HREF="../safe/carshop.html">new car safety features and options</A>.  Check it out, if you haven't already done so.)  I also added up the corresponding columns representing the Dealer's List Price.  The difference between these two costs gave me a margin with which to negotiate.  I now knew how much each car actually cost and how much the dealer would ask.  Armed with this information, I was ready to deal.


<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<A name="makemove"></A>
<h3>Making Your Move!</h3>
<P>
A friend of mine who is a self-described "gear head" once told me that the absolute best time to 
make a deal on a new car is the last day of the year.  Barring that, the next best time to make an 
offer is the last day of the month.  He explained that sales people have all sorts of monthly and 
yearly quotas and incentives.  They are much more willing to give in on price if they think they 
can make up their loss in other ways.  Obviously you don't always have the luxury of waiting, 
but if you can, it might be worth your while to keep this in mind.
<P>
Although there were three cars that I felt were equally nice, I was truly in "love" with my 
favorite.  I decided to try to deal for my favorite first...I could always go to another dealer or 
make a deal on one of the other cars if my first experience didn't work out.  Here's what 
happened:
<P>
I sat down with the sales person and discussed the car plus all of the options I wanted.  The 
sales person then added everything up an came up with the price.  <EM><B>SURPRISE</B></EM>, it was the exact 
Dealer List Price I came up with on my printout!  I then revealed my printout and told the sales 
person what I was prepared to offer:  the actual cost of the car plus what I thought was a fair 
percentage for commission.  (This commission percentage is a personal choice and only you and 
the dealer can determine what's fair.)  After conferring with his manager, the sales person came 
back and accepted my proposal.  The whole experience was completely painless!
<P>
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<A name="tradeins"></A>
<h3>A Note about Trade-Ins</h3>
<P>
Again, knowledge is power.  During my research phase, I asked my local Auto Club for the 
value of my old car.  They provided (for free) the average trade-in price as well as the price I 
could expect if I tried to sell it on my own.  The price to sell independently was higher, but it 
would also require time and effort I didn't want to expend.
<P>
After I negotiated the price for my new car and everything was OK'd, I asked the dealer to 
offer a trade-in value.  By waiting, I didn't mess up my new car negotiations with other confusing 
variables...I kept it all separate.  In my case, my older car was in excellent condition and had 
low mileage.  Knowing the price of an average car gave me some leverage when negotiating 
what I thought was a fair trade-in agreement.
<P>
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<A name="thoughts"></A>
<h3>Some Final Thoughts</h3>
<P>
Obviously, I think I got lucky.  I waited for the best possible time to make my offer.  It was a 
slow sales month and frankly, I think my dealer was desperate to move some cars.  Also, one 
of the reasons I was so pleased with the experience was that I felt I paid a fair price for my new 
car.  I didn't try to cheat anyone, and by the same token, I don't think I got ripped off either.
<P>
Had my original dealer not been so quick to accept my bid, I could have shopped elsewhere.  I 
certainly had enough information to do so.  This entire experience reaffirms my belief that the 
best consumer is an educated consumer!  I hope I've been able to provide you with some 
helpful information here.  Good luck and have fun dealing!

<p>Today's cars have more and more safety features included as standard options, and many that can be purchased as options.  Deciding which features make sense, though, and which are worth buying can be challenging.  Many insurance companies offer discounts if these features are in your car.

<BR><HR><BR>
<A NAME="airbag"></A><P>
<H2>Air Bags</H2>
Air bags are important in a crash because they protect your head and face from striking your car's interior, especially the dashboard.  In a head-on crash, sensors take less than 1/20th of a second to alert the inflators that fill the bag.  Using air bags in conjunction with automatic safety belts provides a great deal more protection than using either one alone.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>   
<A NAME="brakes"></A><P>
<H2>Anti-lock Brakes</H2> 
<P>
Conventional brakes may lock and cause a vehicle to skid.  Anti-lock brakes prevent locking by automatically pumping the brakes many times a second.  If your car has anti-lock brakes, you'll need to adjust your braking style.  Conventional brakes require gentle pressure if you are stopping on slippery surfaces, but antilock brakes are activated by heavy braking.  It's a good idea to read your car's manual and talk to your car dealer if you have any questions.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>   
<A NAME="seats"></A><P>
<H2>Built-in Child Seats</H2>
<P>
Since built-in child seats are relatively new, I recommend researching the consumer protection magazines for test results and manufacturer recalls.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>   
<A NAME="headrestr"></A><P>
<H2>Head Restraints</H2>
<P>
All new passenger vehicles are equipped with head restraints that will prevent your head from being snapped back in rear-end crashes.  More and more vehicles are also equipped with rear-seat head restraints.  These restraints work only if they are positioned correctly to prevent your head from snapping back.  Check to see if the head restraints in your car are adjustable (some aren't) and adjust them as necessary.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>   
<A NAME="belts"></A><P>
<H2>Safety Belts</H2>
<P>
Most cars are equipped with manual or automatic safety belts and in some states their use is mandatory.  A lap/shoulder belt combination provides the best protection.  Lap belts should fit snugly across the pelvis, not across the abdomen.  Some shoulder belts can be adjusted to comfortably fit people of different heights.
<P>
Even if you're wearing a shoulder belt in a serious crash, it's possible that the belt may allow enough movement so that you strike the steering wheel or dashboard.  Two innovations, automatic crash tensioners and belt webbing grabbers, can help prevent this.  Webbing grabbers clamp the belt outside the reel, while tensions actually react to crash situations and tighten belts to prevent injuries. 
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A NAME="utility"></A><P>
<H2>Utility Vehicles</H2>
<P>
If you're considering buying one of these increasingly popular alternatives to passenger cars, you should know that smaller utility vehicles are more likely to roll over than cars.  Also, these vehicles don't have to comply with the same federal safety standards as cars.  
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A NAME="size"></A><P>
<H2>Vehicle Size</H2>
<P>
People are injured more often and more severely in small cars than in large ones.  And, it seems, accidents occur more often with small cars considering the higher number of  claims filed for passengers in small cars.
<P>

<h3>Hurricanes</h3>

<p>This hurricane season has been one of the most active in recent history.  We know the devastation that hurricanes can cause...remember "Andrew" in southern Florida or "Hugo" in South Carolina?  Obviously, we can't stop a hurricane from happening...but we can try to minimize the damage by being better prepared.

<P>Anyone living on the Atlantic or Gulf coasts should become familiar with the following ways to lessen the impact of a hurricane:

<p>
<UL>
<LI>When buying or building a home, hire a certified, knowledgeable home inspector who specializes in residential property.  Use a builder who knows the right material and building techniques required for high-wind areas.  Also, check with your local town government for zoning and building codes.
<LI>Discuss evacuation plans with your family, including who to contact or where to meet afterwards, in case you are separated.
<LI>Keep the wind out.  Once the wind penetrates your home, the damage is likely to be extensive.  Bolt 3/4 inch plywood over windows or use masking or duct tape on panes to prevent shattering.
<LI>Install window shutters that can be closed over windows.
<LI>Tie down or secure whatever can't be taken inside.  Lawn furniture can become dangerous projectiles!
<LI>Leave your home when evacuation is recommended.  And leave early to avoid jammed highways, high winds and poor driving visibility.
<LI>Shut off your home's main power switch before you leave.
<LI>Take special precautions for children (bring along a favorite toy or blanket), elderly family members (consider stress and mobility) and those who are on medication or restricted diets.
<LI>Protect your pets.  Remember that pets are usually not allowed at evacuation centers or hotels.  Leave them in a secured area with enough food or water to help them survive.
</UL>

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<a name="quakes"></a>
<h3>Earthquakes</h3>

<p>Most of us are all too familiar with the threat earthquakes pose to Californians.  We take for granted that these dangerous occurrences can't happen elsewhere...and certainly not in our own backyards.  While California remains the greatest risk, experts say that quakes could happen in many areas of the country.  In fact, every state in the country has been shaken by an earthquake.

<P>The U.S. Geological Survey recommends a number of things you can do to protect yourself before and/or during an earthquake.

<P><B>Preparations before an Earthquake</B>

<p>
<UL>
<LI>Determine your home's ability to withstand a quake.  Single-story, wood-frame homes that have been built in the last twenty years are relatively safe and should be able to withstand the horizontal movement of the earth.  However, homes built before the 1940's need extra attention:  wood frames should be bolted to the concrete foundation, so that the home doesn't literally slide off.  "Cripple" walls between the foundation and first floor should be reinforced and chimneys should be braced to prevent them from toppling.
<LI>Avoid fire damage.  Your gas water heater should be fastened to the wall studs and all gas appliances and heaters should be connected to the gas pipe through a short piece of flexible tubing.  Also, place a wrench near the gas shut-off in case it needs to be turned off in a hurry.
<LI>Put latches on cabinet doors to minimize damage from contents dumping onto the floor.
<LI>Check for falling objects.  Heavy items, such as pictures or mirrors, can fall on your bed while you're sleeping.
<LI>Securely fasten shelves to walls and add lips to shelves to prevent expensive items from sliding off.
<LI>Brace or anchor high or top-heavy furniture.  Secure cabinets, computers and machinery that may overturn.
<LI>Store potentially hazardous materials in secure containers.
<LI>Place larger and/or heavier objects on lower shelves.
</UL>

<P>
<B>If an earthquake strikes:</B>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Remain calm.
<LI>Stay away from windows, mirrors and chimneys.  Watch for falling plaster, bricks, light fixtures or other objects.
<LI>Walk for cover.  Get under a table, desk or bed, preferably in a corner away from windows, or in a strong doorway.
<LI>Stay inside.  It's best not to run outside.  Stairways may be broken and/or jammed, and elevators may fail.
<LI>If you are outside, stay in an open area.  Avoid high buildings, walls, power poles, trees and other objects that could fall.
<LI>If you are driving, pull onto a shoulder and stop the car.  Stay in the car until the shaking stops.
</UL>

<h1>Personal Auto</h1><img src="../../images/plauto.gif" align=left><h2>Shaping the largest writer of personal Auto insurance through independent agents</h2>       
<P><br clear=all>
 Bringing together The Travelers Indemnity Company and The Aetna Casualty and Surety Company has created the largest writer of personal automobile insurance through the independent agency system.
 While the companies shared similar target markets, their products, prices and systems were different.  Bringing them together will take some time and a lot of work.  
<P>
 &quot;<i>Our goal is make the transition as smooth as we can for our agents and our insureds,</i>&quot; said Pete Bothwell, head of Personal Automobile.  &quot;<i>There are three keys to making that
happen.  First, we will minimize disruption from pricing and underwriting as much as possible during conversion.  Second, we will test before we implement.  And last, but most important, we will maintain
good two-way communication with our agents.</i>&quot;
<P>
 For pricing, that means introducing a new highly preferred pricing track, in addition to the Travelers Edge product, and traditional preferred and standard products.  If either Travelers or The Aetna Casualty and Surety Company had a significantly more competitive rate in their preferred program, this new pricing track will allow them to maintain that rate without dilution.  On the underwriting side, the additional pricing track will allow agents to count on consistent renewal underwriting at conversion by allowing whole programs to move to their own pricing track without reunderwriting.  This will be especially important to insureds with Aetna Auto Product (AAP) policies.
<P>
 Testing before implementing will occur two ways.  First, before any policies are actually converted they will be re-rated using the proposed program.  The results will be used to modify the program to minimize the number and magnitude of any price increases.    When the program is final, reports will be provided to agents
to help them manage any remaining impact.  Second, the entire conversion process will be tested in a smaller state before being applied countrywide.  And the conversion itself will occur in waves - seven states in the second quarter of 1997, nine states in the third quarter, and the remaining states by year end.
<P>
 Communication is essential throughout.  Progress to date is the result of innumerable agent interviews and meetings.  In addition, there will be a regular flow of information from the company well in advance of any changes to Travelers auto programs to ensure there is plenty of time for agents and customers to respond.  Putting his money where his mouth is, Bothwell has established an internet email account so that customers and agents can <a href="mailto:peter_t_bothwell@travelers.com">email him</a> with any questions, comments or concerns.
<P>
 &quot;<i>Both Travelers and The Aetna Casualty and Surety Company were profitable and growing, but each had different strengths,</i>&quot; said Bothwell. &quot;<i>We want the new company to leverage the best of both in order to become the finest personal auto market our agents and customers have.</i>&quot;
<p>

<a name="property"></a>
<hr>
<P>
<img src="../../images/property.gif" align=left><h2>The future of Travelers Personal Property</h2>
<P>
 Personal Lines will market homeowners and other property products in a total of 49 states.  This includes three states where Personal Lines does business through domestic companies -- Massachusetts,
New Jersey and the Florida, where the newly-formed First Floridian will provide coverage.  
<P>
 The new company is currently maintaining separate product offerings under The Travelers Indemnity Company (Travelers) and The Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (ACSC) and will begin offering the first combined products during the third quarter of 1997.  
<P>
 &quot;<i>We will use the Aetna Casualty and Surety property product as a base, supplemented by Travelers programs for EDGE and Select (high-value homeowners product).  The homeowners contract will feature the ability to package related coverages including scheduled valuable/personal articles and umbrella liability,</i>&quot; says Brooks Clark, who heads Personal Lines Property.
<P>
Personal Lines will lead with its best products in every market. Plans are to choose the best of the two companies' product offerings to help ensure profitable growth while controlling exposure to catastrophic loss.  In addition, an expanded number of pricing tracks in which to place risks will avoid disruption that might
otherwise result due to sizable changes in premiums.  In fact, agents can expect to see as many as four pricing tiers, depending on their state,&quot; Clark said.  &quot;<i>We will offer our most competitive homeowners products in each market, while making changes as transparent as possible to our existing customers.</i>&quot;
<P>
 Discussing coastal management Clark remarks, &quot;<i>We do not take a simplistic approach to this issue.  We look very carefully at all factors prior to making market decisions. This includes reviewing our combined loss exposure and our capital position, our access to reinsurance, and the willingness of regulators to
work with us to preserve our financial integrity while meeting agents' and clients' needs.</i>&quot;  Clark said his group will continue to monitor coastal strategies on a regional basis and noted that agents should expect further evaluations over the next few months.

<hr>
<p>
<img src="../../images/plflood.gif" align=left><h2>Flood, Specialty Markets and Ocean Marine</h2>
<P><br clear=all>
 Specialty Markets head Pat Linton is excited about The Travelers Indemnity Company and The Aetna Casualty and Surety Company merger, especially the opportunity to build a Personal Lines powerhouse.
<P>
 Specialty Markets' products include Flood Insurance, Specialty Niche Markets and Ocean Marine products.  What does Pat see as a priority for consumers to focus on?  &quot;<i>Flood, Flood, and more Flood.</i>&quot;  
<P>
 All 'Write Your Own' (WYO) companies have been challenged by the federal government to produce 20% new business growth over their October 1994 policy count by Sept. 30.  This challenge reinforces the need to educate agents and customers about Flood Program benefits.  Linton says, &quot;<i>I believe information about Flood is not widely known.  Unfortunately, most insureds incorrectly believe their existing homeowners policy provides flood coverage.  As a result, we've made a good deal of <a href="../covered/flood101.html">information about Flood insurance</a> available within our Web site.</i>&quot;  
<P>
 A flood policy covers damage to structures and their enclosed contents, as well as utility connections, furnaces and other equipment normally located in basements.  A homeowners policy will not cover
these damages.  &quot;<i>Most of our insureds find this out too late,</i>&quot; says Linton.  Flood insurance may be required if policyholders have a mortgage on their home.  Some lending institutions are
reviewing their mortgage portfolios to identify properties without flood insurance.  If customers can't show proof of insurance, the mortgage company may arrange to provide the coverage--at significantly higher rates.
<P>
The program is administered through the Flood Insurance service center in Bethesda, Md.  The basic responsibility of a flood agent is to offer the coverage, complete the application and send it (with premium) to the service center.  Flood policies are effective after a 30-day waiting period, unless the insurance is being provided for a loan closing. 
<P>
 Linton wants to thank agents for their efforts to sell Ocean Marine coverage.  &quot;<i>Our results year-to-date are excellent.  We continue to look for growth in this business, especially in the Midwest and West Coast.</i>&quot;  All processing, underwriting, and servicing of boats under 30 feet will move to the Fall River, Mass., Business Center by year-end 1996 or early 1997.  Linton says the expertise in the Ocean Marine unit has increased as a result of the merger.  &quot;<i>We are very enthusiastic about the future and look forward to continuing our focus on boats and yachts,</i>&quot; says Linton.
<P>
Some Specialty niche markets include: <a href="../covered/folk101.html">American folk art</a>, <a href="../covered/glassware101.html">antique and contemporary glassware and ceramics</a>, <a href="../covered/antiquetoy101.html">antique toy collections</a>, antique boats, trains and cars and <a href="../covered/porcelain101.html">porcelain figurines</a>.  More information about our specialty products is available within the Personal Lines Web site.

<hr>
<p>
<img src="../../images/bcops.gif" align=left><h1>Business Center Operations</h1><br>
<h2>Six centers to divide business processing and underwriting</h2>
<P><br clear=all>
 The new company's Personal Lines organization has determined where business will be processed and underwritten for each given state, dividing the work among six underwriting and policy-processing Business Centers. &quot;<i>These centers will continue to provide agents with the same high level of service they've received in the past,</i>&quot; said Joe Gorman, head of customer service for Personal Lines.
<P>
 &quot;<i>All of the existing Travelers and former Aetna Casualty and Surety Company Business Centers will remain open and agents will continue to work with their current Business Center in the short term,</i>&quot; Gorman said.  
<P>
Over time, however, some agents' business will move to new Business Centers, before the implementation of an integrated Personal Lines product line.  Agents will receive at least three months advance notice before their business is moved, Gorman said.  
<P>
 The new company will continue to offer direct policyholder service (known as PSO at The Aetna Casualty and Surety Company and ISP at Travelers).  Direct policyholder service will remain optional, and will continue to be an important part of the new company's strategy.  The charge, guaranteed for three years, is 2 percent for agents who enroll in 1996.  
<P>
 Billing support will be integrated into the Business Centers beginning in June 1996.

<hr>
<p>
<img align=left src="../../images/billing.gif"><h1>Billing and Remittance</h1><br><br> <h2>No one buys insurance from us because we have a great billing and remittance operation.  But customers will leave us if they have a bad billing experience</h2>
<p><br clear=all>
The billing process -- the customer's most
frequent contact with our company -- is an experience the Billing
and Remittance (B&amp;R) area is making as positive as possible.
<p>  
&quot;<i>No one buys insurance from us because we have a great
billing and remittance operation.  But customers will leave us
if they have a bad billing experience</i>,&quot; said Mel Ollestad,
who oversees Billing Services Operations.  &quot;<i>We make the process
simple and fair for the customer while being cashflow-conscious
and cost-effective for the company.  Once underwriting accepts
a risk, it's our job to keep it.</i>&quot;  
<p>
B&amp;R will use the former Travelers Account Billing System (ABS) to bill for all policies
written under both companies.  After policies are converted to
ABS, which begins during the first quarter of 1997, all payment
processing will occur at the Remittance Center in Hartford. 
<p>
B&amp;R
plans to transfer former Aetna Casualty and Surety Company policies
into ABS on a state-by-state basis.  The premium balance of open
policies will be moved to the new system at that time, rather
than waiting for each policy to renew.  This accelerates conversion
and reduces the possibility of a customer receiving bills from
two systems. 
<p>
&quot;<i>We're trying to make as many changes as possible
before converting to ABS including moving the customer service
portion of our operation back to the various business centers.
 This way, the impact of the move to ABS will be minimized,</i>&quot;
said Ollestad.  Both the old and new policy issue environments
will be compatible with ABS.  &quot;<i>We will train field staff
and agents who are new to ABS to minimize problems and handle
the changeover</i>,&quot; Ollestad noted.  
<p>
Down payment requirements on new policies 
for the new company will be 25% in most states and for most products.
 If less than the entire down payment amount is received with
an application, the customer will be asked to catch up on their
first bill.  ABS has already implemented this practice for Travelers
business.   
<p>
Another change is that commissions can be paid to
agents by check or electronic fund transfer after conversion to
ABS.  This is new to former Aetna Casualty and Surety agents, and something which has
been popular among Travelers agents. 
<p>
Since commission is a part
of determining the income generated by an agency, agents prefer
to be paid full commission and then charged a separate fee for
company-provided service.  On the ABS commission statement, agents
will see the full commission and applicable charges for service
per item.       The format of activity lists, provided to agents
to monitor their clients payment activity, will be modified to
reflect all categories used by both Aetna Casualty and Surety and Travelers agents.
 After conversion to ABS, this list will be mailed three times
per week with regular agent mailings. 
<p>
ABS also supports a Voice
Response Unit at Travelers Personal Lines business centers to
handle routine agent billing inquiries.  Enhancements are being
made to the automated inquiry system to expand its use to all
Travelers and Aetna Casualty and Surety Personal Lines business centers and offer it
directly to customers after policies are converted to ABS.  Aetna Casualty and Surety
customers accustomed to The Aetna Casualty and Surety Company's &quot;Billing Information Network&quot;
will continue to have that service until their policy is converted
to ABS, then they'll have access to the new VRU.

<p>
<h1>Claim Operations</h1>
<img src="../../images/claim.gif" align=left><h2>By August 1997 we will have one, seamless Personal Lines
Claim organization</h2><p><br clear=all>
Customers with personal property-casualty coverage will be pleased
with the new company's dedicated nationwide Personal Lines Claim
operation.
<P>
&quot;<i>By August 1997 we will have one, seamless Personal Lines
Claim organization,</i>&quot; said Priscilla Koch, who has led Travelers'
Personal Lines Claim operation for the past two years and serves
in the same role in the new company.
<P>
&quot;<i>It makes sense to offer a focused Personal Lines Claim resource.
 We've developed a claim process that's more friendly to Personal
Lines customers and agents and gives our adjusters more depth
at handling personal claims.  We've also created technology that
helps us process personal claims more efficiently every step of
the way.</i>&quot;
<P>
The major benefit, Koch said, is that the company is more responsive
and more sympathetic to the needs of its individual customers.
 The approach has paid off, helping Travelers cut in half the
average time it takes to issue first payments on less-complex
personal claims.  &quot;<i>We're looking to carry this success through
as we merge operations with Aetna Casualty and Surety,</i>&quot; Koch
added.
<P>
<h3>Direct Loss Reporting</h3>
<p>
A major factor in that success - direct loss reporting - will continue
for both Travelers and Aetna Casualty and Surety personal claims,
she said. <a href="#box">(see box)</a>
<P>
Customers will begin seeing signs of the new company's combined personal
lines claim capabilities over the next few months.  By the end
of the third quarter, auto damage appraisers from each company
will be cross-trained and available to inspect all auto losses
from either company.  This will add flexibility to the new company's
auto appraising capability, offering each company's customers
quicker response through a larger network of staff appraisers
in more locations.  Also, by June 1, new large property losses
will be handled by a combined Personal Lines Claim General Adjuster
Program, and a single catastrophe response plan will be in place
before the tropical storm season arrives.
<P>
<h3>Managers and Unit Leaders Named</h3>
<p>
Koch reported that Personal Lines Claim Managers and unit leaders
have been named in 17 regional offices <a href="#offices">(see box)</a> to oversee claim
handling and related activities in more than 30 locations nationwide.
 Claim managers play an important role as part of regional marketing
teams, continuing a trend at both companies, she said.  In this
role, claim managers take part in key meetings with agents, customers
and prospects to develop customer-focused claim programs and to
promote the company's claim service as an advantage for customers.
 Claim staff also provides initial input to local strategies for
underwriting, product development and pricing. 
<P>
<h3>Claims Technology</h3>
<p>
On the technology front, the company will extend the Travelers
IMPACT workstation to handle Aetna Casualty and Surety claims.
 This system, which has helped Travelers Personal Lines Claim
reach challenging claim handling productivity and quality goals
in recent years, will be tested in late summer in the Washington,
D.C. area.  A similar system test for auto claims will take place
by year end.  The system will begin expanding countrywide in early
'97 for all Aetna Casualty and Surety auto and property claims.
<P>
<h3>Quality Service Consultant</h3>
<p>
To help make it easier for customers and agents to work with the
new company's Claim operations, a &quot;<i>quality service consultant</i>&quot;
position will be established in approximately 15 locations nationwide.
 Working with Personal and Commercial Lines Claim managers, these
consultants will be an additional resource for addressing agents'
and customers' claim service issues.  Quality service consultants
will also work with claim managers to measure agent and customer
satisfaction, set and monitor service standards and develop ways
to improve claim service.

<h2>Don't let your dreams get washed away!</h2>

<p>It's pop-quiz time.  The banks of Lake Pontchartrain in southeast Louisiana spill into your home after an excessive rainfall, causing severe damage to your home and its contents.  Your Homeowners insurance takes care of all related costs, yes or no?  Answer:  Not at all!  Why?  Because damages caused by floods are specifically excluded from all Homeowners policies.  You need to have a separate Flood Insurance policy in order to be covered.

<P>Flood insurance is a very necessary coverage for those who live in flood prone areas.  I'll try to explain this coverage as clearly as possible.  Before I begin, you need to be aware of one very important difference between flood and homeowners insurance.  Homeowners insurance is designed to bring your home and its contents back to the same financial condition it was in before a loss, but Flood insurance is meant only to get you back on your feet.  To understand more about how this coverage operates and what it covers, I've provided the following topics for you:

<A name="history"></A>
<h3>Background Information</h3>
<P>
In the not-too-distant past, flood insurance was unavailable because it was too costly for private insurers to offer.  The national response to flood disasters was generally limited to constructing flood control works such as dams, levees, sea walls, etc.  If you were a flood victim, the only recourse you had was the remote possibility of disaster relief.
<P>
In 1968, Congress established the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) with two objectives in mind.  The first goal was give property owners the opportunity to purchase insurance protection for flood losses.  The second goal was to encourage communities to implement and enforce measures to reduce future flood risks in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs).
<P>
Today, individuals who reside in communities that make the effort to reduce flood risks can receive insurance as a financial protection against flood losses.  And the government has been able to lower its financial risk by having local governments take responsibility and steps to limit the chances (and the resulting devastation) of floods.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A name="helps"></A>
<h3>How Flood insurance helps your community</h3>
<P>
By limiting development in areas of high flood risk and encouraging construction practices that help reduce the impact on structural damages, a community can protect its citizens against the high costs associated with flood disasters.  The entire community benefits from effective flood area management:  the risk of loss is lessened, the impact on property is decreased and property owners can purchase much needed insurance protection.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A name="nopart"></A>
<h3>What if my community chooses not to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program?</h3>
<P>
Flood insurance is not available to residents of communities that don't participate.  Also, if a presidentially declared disaster due to flooding occurs in a non-participating community, no federal financial assistance can be provided for the permanent repair or reconstruction of insurable buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs).  Your local insurance agent or community officials can inform you whether or not your community is participating in the NFIP.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A name="definition"></A>
<h3>What is a flood?</h3>
<P>
"Flood" is defined as a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
<UL>
<LI>overflow of inland or tidal waters,
<LI>the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source, or
<LI>mudslides caused by flooding.
</UL>
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A name="need"></A>
<h3>Do I need flood insurance?</h3>
<P>
Don't let the fact that you don't own beach-front property lull you into a sense of false security.  The fact is that beach-front structures only account for 3% of all flood losses.  Homeowners who live in high hazard flood areas should seriously contemplate purchasing Flood Insurance...especially when you consider that they have a 26% chance of having a flood loss over the course of a 30 year mortgage!  Often, flood insurance is required as a condition of granting a mortgage if your lender determines that your home is in a high hazard flood area.
<P>
Even if you live in a low hazard flood area your property may still be at risk.  Each year, about 35% of all flood claims paid are for property located outside high-risk areas.  The good news is that there is a Preferred Risk program that offers substantial premium discounts for homes located in low hazard areas.
<P>
If you think your home is at risk, you might want to consider contacting your local agent.  Or you can check out special flood insurance maps published by FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Agency).  These maps (which indicate a community's flood hazard areas and the associated degree of risk) are usually kept on file at your local town hall or county building and are available for your review.
<P>

<A name="gettingit"></A>
<h3>How can I get flood insurance?</h3>
<P>
About 85 private insurance companies participate in selling and servicing the National Flood Insurance Program for the federal government.  Flood insurance is available with a one-year or a three-year policy term, depending on the insurer.  I know I'm going to sound like Paula (our money-saving guru), but you should be aware that you can save more on a three-year policy.  Your local insurance agent should be able to provide you with all the necessary information.  If you'd like a quote on a flood policy, 
<A HREF="../../mail/flood.html">Let's Talk!</A>
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A name="waiting"></A>
<h3>Waiting Period Rules</h3>
<P>
Don't wait until the water's rising to decide that you need Flood Insurance!  There is a standard 30-day waiting period for new applications and endorsements to increase coverage.  The effective date of the new policy will be 12:01 a.m. local time on the 30th calendar day following the application and premium payment date.  The exception is for insurance purchased as a condition for a mortgage loan.  In that case, the flood insurance is effective on the date of the closing.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A name="limits"></A>
<h3>Coverage Availability/Limits</h3>
<P>
As I said earlier, Flood insurance is catastrophic insurance, meaning it's meant only to get you back on your feet again and not restore you to your condition before the flood.  There are limits as to how much insurance will be provided.  For example, residential buildings can only receive up to $250,000 in coverage, non-residential buildings only $500,000.  Contents within the home are also limited up to $100,000 for residential ($500,000 for non-residential) locations.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A name="covered"></A>
<h3>What's Covered?</h3>
<P>
Direct physical losses by flood are covered.  Also covered are losses resulting from flood-related erosion caused by excessive waters accompanied by a severe storm, flash flood, abnormal tidal surge or the like, which result in flooding.  Damages due to mudslides, if caused by flooding, are also covered.
<P>
Coverage is provided for flood damage to the building itself.  This includes foundation elements, as well as posts, pilings, piers or other support systems for elevated buildings.  Coverage is excluded for:
<UL>
<LI>most buildings located entirely over water (like boat houses),
<LI>structures other than buildings (such as fences, retaining walls, swimming pools, underground structures), and
<LI>items like walkways, decks, driveways and patios located outside the building.
</UL>
<P>
Coverage is also available on an actual cash value basis for the contents (your personal possessions) located inside the building.  However, it's very important that you know that coverage on valuable items (such as artwork, rare books, jewelry and furs) is limited to only $250.  And, coverage is not available at all for personal property used for business.  (A Valuable Items Policy will protect your most treasured possessions from many perils, including floods.  You might want to contact your local agent to learn more about this very important protection.)
<P>
Remember, this section is not intended to be nor is it a complete description of coverage.  Your policy or an independent agent can provide you with complete provisions.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A name="basements"></A>
<h3>Coverage for Basements and enclosed areas beneath the lowest floor</h3>
<P>
You need to be aware that flood insurance only provides limited coverage for these areas.  Coverage is available for equipment necessary to the habitability of the building such as utility connections, sump pumps, well water tanks and pumps, fuel or water tanks, furnaces, clothes washers and dryers, food freezers and air conditioners.  Clean up expenses are also covered.  Likewise, basement dry walls (unpainted), sheet rock walls (including fiberglass insulation) and ceilings are covered.
<P>
However, finished structural elements (such as paneling and linoleum) and contents (such as rugs and furniture) in basements are not covered.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A name="replace"></A>
<h3>Replacement Cost versus Actual Cash Value</h3>
<P>
Here's an extremely important point.  Replacement cost coverage (which pays to replace or restore a structure or item) is only offered on a limited basis...and only for a single-family dwelling that is your principal residence.  To receive replacement cost coverage on the structure, you must be insured for at least 80% of the building's replacement cost at the time of the loss or the maximum amount of coverage available, whichever is less.
<P>
Contents losses are always adjusted on an actual cash value basis.  That means that you only receive what the item was worth as of day of the loss.  For example, if you bought a $300 color television two years ago and it was damaged in a flood, you might only receive about $50 for it, if that is what the equipment was worth on the day of the flood.  Your building loss would also be handled this way unless you qualified for replacement cost coverage.  A recent FAQ (Frequently Asked Question) provides more detail on the merits of replacement cost coverage.  Click <A HREF="../faq/septfaq.html#question3"> here </A> if you want to go to the Replacement Cost Coverage FAQ.
<P>
Remember, Flood insurance is not meant to restore your home to its original condition, just to get you back on your feet!  And, it's much better than having no coverage at all.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A name="deductibles"></A>
<h3>Deductibles</h3>
<P>
A deductible is the amount you have to pay out of your own pocket before the insurance coverage kicks in.  Standard flood deductibles are $500 and $750.  Higher deductibles are available to reduce policy premiums.  Please be aware that with Flood insurance your deductible will be applied to both your building and its contents, even though they might be damaged by the same flood.

<P>I recently visited the magnificent Shelburne Museum in Vermont,
home to one of America's most extensive and diverse collections
of folk art. American Folk Art enthusiasts from around the globe
are encouraged to visit this &quot;Smithsonian of New England&quot;
to bask in the beauty and splendor of its decoys, weathervanes,
quilts, canes, carousel figures and signs.  If Shelburne, Vermont
is not currently on your travel itinerary, you can visit and tour
the 
<a href="http://bohr.genghis.com/shelburne/html/index.htm">Shelburne Museum</a>
on the Net!

<P>Even if you don't have a collection to fill a museum, your antique
American Folk Art reflects years of personal commitment, searching
and saving. Anyone who values the beauty, care and craftsmanship
that went into this art form can appreciate the need to adequately
safeguard these treasures. Did you know that in most cases your
Homeowners policy only offers limited coverage for unique treasures
such as folk art?

<P>Recognizing your need to properly safeguard your collection, Travelers 
has teamed with the <a href="#alton">Alton Insurance Agency</a>, 
which has considerable
experience insuring folk art.  Together, we've developed a program
tailored to the special needs of serious collectors.  Here's what

<h3>Insurance Designed for Special Collections</h3>

<P>Pirates come in many forms:  they can be real-life thieves, or
natural ones like fires or floods.  Antique American Folk Art
insurance provides all-risk, worldwide coverage, including protection
against theft and fire.  You or members of your household also
pose a threat to your collection:  as careful as we try to be,
accidents can happen.  Antique American Folk Art insurance also
offers <B>coverage for breakage</B>. That means if you accidentally
break one of your pieces, you're covered!

<P>Any items with an individual value of more than $5,000 must be
listed separately on the policy.  For items with individual values
of $5,000 or less, you have the option of selecting &quot;blanket&quot;
coverage, which covers all of these items up to a total of $75,000. 
Such items do not have to be individually listed on your policy.

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="eligible"></a>

<h3>Eligible Folk Art</h3>

<P>
As you can see, the Antique American Folk Art program offers comprehensive
insurance protection for a large variety of items:
<UL>
<LI>ship figureheads and ships
<LI>duck and shore bird decoys
<LI>trade signs and shop figures
<LI>patriotic and historic figures
<LI>whirligigs
<LI>carousel animals
<LI>scrimshaw
<LI>canes
<LI>quilts
<LI>rocking horses
<LI>coverlets
<LI>figurines
<LI>paintings.
</UL>

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="additions"></a>

<h3>Additions to Your Collection</h3>

<P>A collection wouldn't be a collection unless we kept adding to
it!  Your Antique American Folk Art policy automatically insures
additional pieces for up to 30 days from the date of acquisition. 
At that time we must be notified for coverage to apply.  The
benefit here is that you don't have to worry about insuring your
new item the moment you receive it.  However, don't wait too long,
you might forget later!

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="coverage"></a>

<h3>Coverage for Miscellaneous Items</h3>

<P>Sometimes you might own extra, smaller pieces that aren't specifically
listed on your policy.  Perhaps it's an antique sign or small
decoy.  Or maybe there are items that you've simply forgotten
to list.  You are covered for up to 10% of the total coverage
amount your policy provides for items that are valued at less
than $5,000 each.  For example, if your policy offers $150,000
in total coverage, you could receive up to $15,000 in protection
for unlisted items.  Again, items valued over $5,000 must be scheduled
(or listed) individually on the policy in order to be covered.

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="other"></a>

<h3>Other Benefits</h3>

<UL>
<LI><B>Affordable Coverage.</B>  This valuable protection won't

$250, or no deductible at all.  By choosing a higher deductible
(and thereby assuming some of the risk), you can reduce your insurance
premium.

<h3>The Best Precaution is Prevention</h3>

<P>Obviously, nothing creates peace of mind like comprehensive insurance
protection.  But there are other things you can do to safeguard
your collection.  Depending on the value of your collection, certain
security measures for your premises may be required.  You've spent
considerable time (as well as financial resources) building your
collection with one-of-a-kind treasures, you really should make
sure that you don't lose them.

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="valuation"></a>

<h3>Valuation is Important</h3>

<P>To assure that your collection is properly insured, it's important
to document its worth.  The total value of your collection determines
your coverage amount and your premium payment.  You may find it
beneficial to have appraisals on all your items, but for this
coverage, appraisals <B>are required</B> <B>for items with an
individual value of $10,000 or more</B> and must be done by a
qualified professional.  Appraisals must not be more than five
years old.  For each item valued at less than $10,000, a full
description (normally included in an appraisal), is all that is
needed.

<P>Though it isn't required for your policy, you may want to photograph
each piece in your collection and store the photos in a safe place.
If your entire collection is stolen or damaged, it will be easy
to remember each item for your claim report.

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<P>How are collections created?  We each have our own special memories
of those moments when we first knew that something very precious
was worth collecting.  Was it the glorious colors of Depression
glass that your grandmother so lovingly displayed that first caught
your eye?  Perhaps your first piece of antique glassware was a
treasured item handed down by some dear relative.  Or maybe your
appreciation for the beauty and craftsmanship of these items began
so early in your life that collecting them was as natural to you
as breathing.  Whenever it began, or for whatever reasons, doesn't
it now seem like you have special china, ceramic glassware and
ceramics, crystal, and glass antiques and collectibles in almost
every room of your home?

<p>These items have more than sentimental value or aesthetic appeal. 
As antiques and collectibles, certain pieces -- or your collection
as a whole -- could have a significant monetary value. Shouldn't
your collection have the protection it deserves?

<p>Recognizing your need to properly safeguard your collection, Travelers
has teamed with the <a href="#about">International Collectors Insurance 
Agency</a>,
which has considerable experience with glassware antiques and
collectibles. Together, we've developed a program tailored to
the special needs of serious collectors. Here's what you need

<h3>Insurance Designed for Special Collections</h3>

<p>Pirates come in many forms: they can be real-life thieves, or
natural ones like fires or floods. When you are dealing with
special glassware collections, especially expensive antiques,
you need to know that basic Homeowner policies place restrictions
on the amount of coverage offered should these pirates strike. 
For example, under a Homeowners policy, the contents (including
antiques) are only insured on an actual cash value, which can
represent a fraction of actual worth.

<P>Under the Glassware and Ceramic Antiques and Collectibles insurance
program you can purchase all-risk, worldwide protection for your
treasured china, ceramic, porcelain, crystal and glass antiques
and collectibles.  As you can see, this policy offers insurance
protection for almost any type of glassware collection.

<P>This all-risk coverage offers protection in most situations, including
theft and fire. However, you or members of your household also
pose a threat to your collection: as careful as we try to be,
accidents can happen.  Glassware and Ceramic Antiques and Collectibles
insurance also offers <B>coverage for breakage</B> (Homeowners
policies don't). That means, if you accidentally break one of
your pieces, you're covered!  Although no deductible applies to
many types of losses, a 10% deductible per loss ($100 minimum)
is applied to breakage.

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="additions"></a>

<h3>Additions to Your Collection</h3>

<P>A collection wouldn't be a collection unless we kept adding to
it! Your Glassware and Ceramic Antiques and Collectibles policy
automatically insures additional pieces (valued <B>up to</B> $3,000)
for up to 90 days from the date of acquisition. Items valued
<B>over</B> $3,000 are automatically insured for up to 30 days
from the date they are acquired. At that time we must be notified
for coverage to apply. The benefit here is that you don't have
to worry about insuring your new item the moment you receive it.
However, don't wait too long, you might forget later!

<h3>Coverage for Miscellaneous, Low-Cost Items</h3>

<P>Sometimes you might own extra, smaller pieces that aren't specifically
listed on your policy.  Perhaps it's a ceramic candy dish or antique
sugar bowl. Or maybe there are items that you've simply forgotten
to list. You are covered for up to 10% of the total coverage
amount your policy provides for items that are valued at less
than $3,000 each. For example, if your policy offers $70,000
in total coverage, you could receive up to $7,000 in protection
for unlisted items. Items valued over $3,000 must be scheduled
(or listed) individually on the policy in order to be covered.

I was 12 years old when my grandmother passed away.  My father
was charged with the difficult task of cleaning out her home.
 One of the discoveries he made was a tin soldier collection that
had been saved from his youth.  Unaware of the treasures uncovered,
and wanting to give one last tangible gift from our beloved Grammie,
the World War I-style doughboys were given to my two younger brothers
(ages 7 and 3). Unfortunately, what they soon discovered was
that a quick twist could easily decapitate a soldier, or remove
an arm or a leg...such are the consequences of war (even a child's
imaginary one).  In no time, these beautiful toy soldiers were
lost forever in every way, except in my memory.

<P>As an adult I am heartsick when I think of the treasure we squandered. 
As a collector of antique toys, you probably understand my sadness. That's 
why safeguarding your antique toy collection is so important. Should 
something happen to your treasured collection, at least you'd have the 
ability to replace it, or at least be compensated for your loss.

<P>Recognizing your need to properly safeguard your collection, Travelers
has teamed with the <a href="#reeves">Reeves &amp; Melvin Agency</a>, which has
considerable experience with insuring antique toys.  Together,
we've developed a program tailored to the special needs of serious

<h3>Coverage for Miscellaneous Items</h3>

<P>Sometimes you might own extra, smaller pieces that aren't specifically
listed on your policy. Perhaps it's a small tin soldier or cast
iron car. Or maybe there are items that you've simply forgotten
to list. You are covered for up to 10% of the total coverage
amount your policy provides for items that are valued at less
than $2,500 each. For example, if your policy offers $150,000

<a name="valuation"></a>

<h3>Valuation is Important</h3>

<P>To assure that your collection is properly insured, it's important
to document its worth. The total value of your collection determines
your coverage amount and your premium payment. You may find it
beneficial to have appraisals on all your items, but for this
coverage, verification of value is only <B>required for
items with a value over $2,500</B> and must be done by a qualified
professional. For each item valued at less than $2,500, a full
description (normally included in an appraisal), is all that is
needed. The description should include age, faults (if any),
condition and value.

<P><a href="#reeves">Reeves &amp; Melvin</a> 
has a relationship with a number of
respected antique toy appraisers. These appraisers, nationally
recognized for their expertise and professionalism, have offered
their services to Reeves &amp; Melvin clients at a reasonable cost.

<a name="best"></a>

<h3>The Best Precaution is Prevention</h3>

<P>Obviously, nothing creates peace of mind like comprehensive insurance
protection. But there are other things you can do to safeguard
your collection. Depending on the value of your collection, certain
security measures for your premises may be required.  You've spent
considerable time (as well as financial resources) building your
collection with one-of-a-kind treasures, you really should make
sure that you don't lose them.

<P>Though it isn't required for your policy, you may want to photograph
each piece in your collection and store the photos in a safe place. 
If your entire collection is stolen or damaged, it will be easy to 
remember each item for your claim report.

<p>Some years ago, I received my very first Christmas porcelain miniature house from a dear friend.  It was love at first sight!  The superior craftsmanship, the warmth, the attention to detail:  it all touched me.  Since then I've been adding to my collection; sometimes I receive them as gifts, sometimes I splurge on myself!  Now I have a menagerie of homes that I take out every year at holiday time.  My home wouldn't feel the same without them.

<p>If you are a porcelain collector, you know what I mean.  Whether it's porcelain Christmas villages, Enesco&#174; figurines (with their round eyes, tiny fingers and gentle colors), or some other porcelain product, you have made an investment of time, money and love.  Porcelain collections can be as varied and unique as the individuals who collect them.  These pieces aren't just possessions, they're part of your family.

<p>Recognizing your need to properly safeguard your collection, Aetna has teamed with the <a href="#RL&G">RL&G Agency, Inc.</a> which has considerable experience with porcelain collectibles.  Together, we've developed a program tailored to the special needs of serious collectors.  Here's what you need to know about this exclusive Porcelain Collection insurance:

<h3>Insurance Designed for Special Collections</h3>

<p>Under the Porcelain Collection insurance program you can purchase full protection for your treasured porcelain possessions.  Pirates come in many forms:  they can be real-life thieves, or natural ones like fires or floods.  Porcelain Collection insurance provides all-risk, worldwide coverage, including protection against theft and fire.

<p>However, you or members of your household also pose a threat to your collection:  as careful as we try to be, accidents can happen.  Porcelain Collection insurance also offers coverage for breakage (Homeowners policies don't).  That means, if you accidentally break one of your pieces, you're covered!  Although no deductible applies to many types of losses, a 10% deductible may be applied to breakage.

<p><a href="#index">[ return to list ]</a>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="additions"> </a>
<h3>Additions to Your Collection</h3>

<p>A collection wouldn't be a collection unless we kept adding to it!  Your Protection Collection policy automatically insures additional pieces (valued up to $250) for up to 90 days from the date of acquisition.  At that time we must be notified for coverage to apply.  The benefit here is that you don't have to worry about adding your new item the moment you receive it.  However, don't wait too long, you might forget later!

<p><a href="#index">[ return to list ]</a>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="coverage"> </a>
<h3>Coverage for Miscellaneous, Low-Cost Items</h3>

<p>Sometimes you might own extra, smaller pieces that aren't specifically listed on your policy.  Perhaps it's an old-fashioned porcelain light-post or a small bird.  You are covered for up to 10% of the total coverage amount your policy provides for items that are valued at less than $75 each.  For example, if your policy offers $50,000 in total coverage, you could receive up to $5,000 in protection for unlisted items.

<h3>About Patty Rickey</h3>

<p>You might say that collecting porcelain figurines is in Patty Rickey's blood!  Her mother is the president of a local Enesco&#174; Collectors Club in Charleston, South Carolina.  In fact, Patty's first figurine was a gift from her Mom, an Enesco&#174; porcelain bride and groom for the top of her wedding cake!

<p>That was 15 years ago.  Today Patty is an avid collector of Enesco&#174; products.  It was Patty's passion for her collection that led her to investigate insurance coverages.  This sent her on an often frustrating quest...insurance protection for a collection such as hers simply did not exist.  That's when Patty approached us.  Together we developed a comprehensive and affordable insurance package that considers the serious collector's point of view.  That product is the Porcelain Collection Policy.

<p>Today, you can find Patty at the <a href="#RL&G">RL&G Agency</a>, as well as Enesco&#174; conventions and cruises.  She's getting national attention for her expertise on insurance protection for porcelain collections, and she's getting rave reviews for her professional and responsive service.  In fact, if you want more information on the Porcelain Collection policy, or even if you just have suggestions on ways to fine-tune it, contact Patty through <a href="../../mail/porcelain.html">Let's Talk</a>.

<TITLE>Travelers Flood Safety Tips</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT hspace=10 SRC="../../images/flood.gif"><BR><IMG SRC="../../images/floodsaf.gif" ALT="Flood Safety"><BR>
Floods are, of course, devastating. But there are many things you can do, both before and during a flood, to increase your chances of survival. Take the time now to find out what  you should do if floodwaters threaten you and your family.<P>
<BR>
<H3>Steps to take today</H3>
<ul>
<LI>Buy flood insurance. Homeowners insurance does not cover damage caused by flooding.  You should contact your agent about flood insurance, or if you'd like a quote on flood insurance, <A HREF="../../mail/flood.html">Let's Talk!</A>  There is a 30-day waiting period for this policy to become effective, so don't wait until the water is rising.
<P>
<LI>Make an itemized list of <a href="./inventory.html">personal property</a>, including furnishings, clothing, and valuables. Photographs of your home -- inside and out -- are helpful. These will assist your insurance adjuster in settling claims and will help prove uninsured losses, which are tax deductible.  Put the list and photos in your safe deposit box at the bank.
<P>
<LI>Learn the safest route from your home or place of business to high, safe ground if you should have to evacuate in a hurry.
<P>
<LI>Keep a portable radio, emergency cooking equipment, and flashlights in working order, and keep extra batteries on hand.
<P>
<LI>People who live in frequently flooded areas should keep on hand materials such as sandbags, plywood, plastic sheeting, and lumber which can be used to protect property.   Remember, sandbags should not be stacked directly against the outer walls of a building, since, when wet, the bags may create added pressure on the foundation.
</UL>
<br>
<H3>When the flood comes</H3>
<ul>
<LI>Safety is the most important consideration. Since floodwaters can rise very rapidly, you should be prepared to evacuate before the water level reaches your property.
<P>
<LI>Keep a battery-powered radio tuned to a local station, and follow all instructions for your area. Be prepared to evacuate at a moment's notice.
<P>
<LI>When outside the house, remember, <EM>floods are deceptive.</EM> Avoid flooded roads, and don't attempt to walk through floodwaters.
<P>
<LI>If, and only if, time permits, turn off all utilities at the main power switch, and close the main gas valve if evacuation is likely. 
<P>
<LI>Do not touch any electrical equipment unless it is in a dry area and you are standing on a piece of dry wood while wearing rubber gloves and rubber-soled boots or shoes.  Certainly, don't log onto your computer!
<P>
<LI>Move valuable papers, furs, jewelry, clothing, and other contents to upper floors or higher elevations.
<P>
<LI>Fill bathtubs, sinks, and jugs with clear water in case regular supplies are contaminated.  You can sanitize these items by first rinsing them with bleach.
<P>
<LI>Board up windows or protect them with storm shutters.
<P>
<LI>Bring outdoor possessions inside the house or tie them down securely.
<P>
<LI>If it is safe to evacuate by car, you should consider stocking the car with nonperishable foods (like canned goods), a plastic container of water, blankets, first aid kit, flashlights, dry clothing, and any special medication needed by your family.  Keep the gas tank at least half full, since gasoline pumps will not be working if the electricity goes off.
<P>
<LI>Do not drive where the water is over the roads. Parts of the road may already be washed out.
<P>
<LI>If your car stalls in a flooded area, abandon it as soon as possible. Floodwaters can rise rapidly and sweep a car (and its occupants) away.   Many people have died while trying to move vehicles stalled in floods.
<P>
<LI>If you're caught in your home by rising water, move to the second floor and, if necessary, to the roof. Take warm clothing, a flashlight, and a portable radio with you.  Then wait for help.  Don't try to swim to safety.  Rescue teams will be looking for you.
</UL>
<br>
<H3>After the flood</H3>
<ul>
<LI>If your home, apartment or business has suffered flood damage, immediately call the agent or company handling your flood insurance policy. An adjuster will be assigned to inspect your property as soon as possible.
<P>
<LI>Before entering a building that has been flooded, check for structural damage. Make sure it is not in danger of collapsing. Turn off any outside gas lines at the meter or tank. If you smell gas, call your utility company immediately.
<P>
<LI>When you enter the building, do not use an open flame as a source of light, since gas still may be trapped inside. Use a battery-powered flashlight.
<P>
<LI>Watch for downed electrical wires.  Make certain that the main power switch is turned off.  Do not turn on any lights or appliances until an electrician has checked the system for short circuits.
<P>
<LI>Cover broken windows and holes in the roof or walls to prevent further weather damage.
<P>
<LI>Proceed with immediate clean-up measures to prevent any health hazards. Perishable items pose a health problem and should be listed and photographed before discarding.  Throw out fresh foods and medicines that have come in contact with floodwaters.
<P>
<LI>Water for drinking and food preparation should be used <EM>only if the public water system has been declared safe</EM>.  In an emergency, water may be obtained by draining a hot water tank or melting ice cubes.
<P>
<LI>Take pictures of the damage to your building and contents. Refrigerators, sofas and other hard goods should be hosed off and kept for the adjuster's inspection. Use a household cleanser to clean items you'll be keeping. Any partially damaged items should be dried and aired. The adjuster will make recommendations concerning repair or disposal.
<P>
<LI>Take all wooden furniture outside to dry, but keep it out of direct sunlight to prevent warping.  A garage or carport is a good place for drying.  Remove drawers and other moving parts as soon as possible, but do not pry open swollen drawers from the front.  Instead, remove the backing and push the drawers out.
<P>
<LI>Shovel out mud while it is still moist, to give walls and floors a chance to dry.  Once plastered walls have dried, brush off loose dirt.  Wash with household cleanser and rinse with clean water.  Always start at the bottom and work up. Ceilings are done last.  Also, special attention must be paid to cleaning out heating ducts and plumbing systems.
<P>
<LI>Mildew can be removed from dry wood with a solution of 1 cup liquid chlorine bleach in 1 gallon of water.
<P>
<LI>Clean metal at once, then wipe with a kerosene-soaked cloth.  A light coat of oil will prevent iron from rusting.  Scour all utensils and, if necessary, use fine steel wool on unpolished surfaces.  Aluminum may be brightened by scrubbing with a solution of vinegar, cream of tartar and hot water.
<P>
<LI>Quickly separate all laundry items to avoid running colors.  Clothing or household fabrics should be allowed to dry <EM>(slowly, away from direct heat)</EM> before brushing off loose dirt.  Rinse the items in lukewarm water to remove lodged soil. Then wash with mild detergent; rinse and dry in sunlight.
<P>
<LI>Flooded basements should be drained and cleaned carefully.  Structural damage will occur if water is pumped out too quickly.  After the floodwaters around your property have subsided, begin draining the basement in stages, about one-third of the water volume each day.

<p>You can't run, you can't hide. Old Man Winter is preparing for his annual visit. Some years 
the Old Man is a kind, thoughtful, even delightful guest. If you remember, the East Coast had 
a relatively mild winter season in 1995. Other times, Old Man Winter is cold and nasty...a 
guest who overstays his welcome! Who can forget the winter of 1994 and this winter...record snowfalls, power 
outages and freezing temperatures were the norm. Although some of us will be sweltering by the 
pool in much warmer climates, a good number of us will be wise to review the following tips

<h3>Preparing your Home for the Winter Blues</h3>

<P>Winter tricks are well known in the northern regions, where strong winds, bitter cold, snow and ice are a fact of life.  Homeowners in the north know that certain winterizing rituals need to be performed before the cold weather arrives.  Homeowners in southern states usually suffer more from infrequent storms because they are not adequately prepared.  No matter where you live, it's good to conduct a quick review of the following:

<P>
<UL>

<LI><B>Clean and check your heating (and chimney) systems</B> to make sure they are in good working condition for the winter months.  This may be a job best performed by a professional.

<LI><B>Have adequate fuel reserves</B> on hand since fuel carriers might not be able to reach you for days.

<LI><B>Close off and lower the temperature in unneeded rooms</B>.  Make sure that there is sufficient heat to prevent freezing.  Insulate pipes that pass through unheated areas.

<LI><B>Prevent cold air from entering your home</B> by stuffing towels or rags in cracks under the doors and covering windows at night.  Close or repair broken windows or other openings.  Cover outside air conditioning units.

<LI><B>Prevent water pipes from freezing</B> by turning off the outside water source.

<LI><B>Protect your roof against heavy snow and ice loads</B>.  Keep gutters clean and roof drains opened.  Clear excessive snow from roofs.

<LI><B>Service snow removal equipment</B> and have rock salt on hand to melt ice on walkways.

<LI><B>If you're going to be away from home</B>, set the furnace to provide minimum heat.
</UL>

<P>

<h3>Tips on Additional Heating Sources</h3>

<P>Additional heating sources such as fireplaces, wood-burning stoves and kerosene heaters are excellent, inexpensive sources of energy.  However, if these heat sources are not installed and maintained properly, they can become <em>extremely</em> dangerous.  I've assembled a number of tips that I strongly urge owners of this type of property to review:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Properly ventilate your home</B> to avoid fire or suffocation.

<LI><B>Allow plenty of room for safety</B>.  Be sure to keep portable energy sources at least three feet away from anything that can burn (including children and pets).

<LI><B>Kerosene Heaters</B>.  Check with your local fire department to make sure kerosene heaters are allowed in your community.  Use only the correct fuel for your unit and follow the manufacturer's instructions.  Refuel outdoors only, and only when the heater is cool.

<LI><B>Never leave alternative heaters on while sleeping</B>.
</UL>

<P>Woodburning Stoves require special precautions:

<p>
<center>
<img
   height=358
   width=294
   SRC="../../images/stovetx.gif"
   alt="diagrammatic stove image">
</center>
<h5>Local building codes vary. Check with your Building Inspector!</h5>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Follow the manufacturer's instructions to the letter.  Don't take short-cuts.
<LI>Keep any combustible surfaces (like unprotected walls or ceilings) or items as far away from the stove as possible.  Generally, a clearance of 36 inches for the stove and 18 inches for the stovepipe should be adequate.
<LI>Be careful of deceptive non-combustible surfaces, too.  A plaster wall, for example, can hide wooden beams that will ignite if heat is sufficient.
<LI>Never use aluminum foil to cover a combustible surface.
<LI>Don't set your stove directly on a wooden floor.  Use a non-combustible stove board extending out at least 18 inches beyond the stove at the front or side where the ashes are removed.
<LI>Your stovepipe should be of corrosion-resistant steel of recommended thickness -- 22 or 24 gauge metal.
<LI>Never pass a stovepipe directly through a combustible wall, ceiling or partition.  If you must go through one of these, use a double wall insulated or double wall metal thimble for the penetration.  Use a fireclay thimble when connecting with a masonry chimney.
<LI>The horizontal section of your stovepipe should not be more than three-fourths as long as the vertical portion above the connecting point.  To insure good draft, this section should rise at least one-quarter inch to the running foot.
<LI>The stovepipe should be the same diameter as the stove's flue collar, be as straight and short as possible, and have no more that two 90 degree turns!
<LI>When hooking up to a masonry chimney, extend the connector through the masonry wall to the inner face of the flue liner (not beyond), and cement it to the masonry.  It's important to use high-temperature cement.
<LI>Every stove needs a damper or draft regulator to help control combustion, unless the manufacturer specifies otherwise.
<LI>Use a standard masonry or factory-built chimney to vent smoke and toxic gases.
<LI>If you are connecting to an existing fireplace chimney, you must get a tight seal where the stovepipe connects to the chimney.
</UL>

<h3>Tips for Winter Drivers</h3>

<P>In many cities and towns it's difficult (if not downright impossible) to remain housebound during the winter season.  Therefore, the following tips should help you deal with the consequences of cold weather and icy roads.  Prepare for winter driving before a storm hits:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Have a mechanic check</B> your car's battery, brakes, fluid levels (antifreeze, windshield washer fluid and oil), as well as the heating and exhaust systems to ensure that your car is in good, safe working condition.
<LI><B>Try to keep your gas tank full</B> during the winter months.  Don't allow the gas to go below half a tank.  Not only will this prevent damage from freezing, you'll avoid running out of gas if you're stuck in a traffic jam during the dead of winter.
<LI><B>Install snow tires</B> or all-weather radials with adequate treads.
<LI><B>If your car <em>does not</em> have anti-lock brakes and you start skidding on the ice, try not to slam on your brakes</B>.  Gently pump your breaks to maintain better control and prevent your wheels from locking.
<LI><B>If your car <em>does</em> have anti-lock brakes, slam on your brakes when skidding on the ice</B>.  Pumping your breaks prevents the anti-lock system from taking over.
<LI><B>An adequate supply of windshield washing liquid is critical</B> to wash away the mud and melted snow that can severely limit visibility.
<LI><B>Prepare for an emergency</B>.  Keep blankets, flares, a sack of sand for traction, shovel, windshield scraper and brush, toolkit, towrope, booster cables and a flashlight with extra batteries in your trunk.  You should also stock your car with materials for survival, should they be needed.  These items could include waterproof matches to melt snow for drinking water, a first aid kit, dry clothing and a brightly colored cloth (to tie to the antenna).
</UL>

<P>Travel only if necessary during a blizzard or severe storm.  If you must travel:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Don't travel alone</B>.  If you must, notify someone of your estimated time of arrival as well as your primary and alternate travel routes.
<LI><B>If STUCK, stay in the car and wait for help</B>.  Run the engine and heater sparingly.  Also make sure your exhaust pipe is clear of snow and ventilate your car so that carbon monoxide fumes won't poison you.  
<LI><B>Keep your energy</B>.  Eat food that provides the body with energy for producing its own heat.  Replenish your body with fluids to prevent dehydration.  Don't eat snow; it will lower your body temperature.  Melt it first.
</UL>

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<A name="play"></A>
<h3>Playing it Safe Outdoors</h3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Dress for outside weather.</B>  Wear layers of loose-fitting, light weight clothing covered by a top coat that will keep you warm and dry, even if you are planning only a short drive in your car.  You can always remove layers when your car warms up...but if you get stuck and the heater won't work, you at least have the layers to keep you warm.
<LI><B>Forget Fashion!</B>  Always cover your head (to prevent body heat from escaping) and cover your mouth with a scarf (to protect your lungs).  Mittens are warmer than gloves because fingers generate heat when they touch each other.
<LI><B>Stretch</B> before you go out to warm up your body.
<LI><B>Don't overexert yourself.</B>  The strain of cold weather and unaccustomed exercise can be a deadly combination.
<LI><B>Keep dry.</B>  Wet clothes lose their ability to insulate and can transmit heat rapidly.
<LI><B>Watch for signs of Frostbite and Hypothermia.</B>  Frostbite can cause permanent damage and Hypothermia can be deadly.  Common symptoms of Frostbite include the loss of feeling in fingers, toes and other extremities as a result of excessive exposure to cold.  Hypothermia is a condition that occurs when body temperature drops below 55 degrees Fahrenheit.  Symptoms include uncontrollable shivering, slow speech, memory lapses, stumbling, drowsiness and exhaustion.  If either condition is suspected, begin warming the person slowly and seek immediate medical attention.

<P>Lately it seems like Mother Nature has been unleashing all of
her venom in the form of winter blizzards and record cold snaps.
 Many areas of the country are experiencing one of the most severe
winter seasons in ages. So, if you're feeling the bite of freezing
temperatures and more snow than you know what to do with, take
a few minutes to plow through my tips for keeping up with Blizzard
Mania.

<P><B>Watch Your Roof</B>

<P>You roof may not be equipped to handle the inordinate weight of
snow, especially when that snow starts to melt. Also, ice that
becomes trapped can create openings and gaps in the roof. Subsequent
rainwater or melting ice ends up inside your home, instead of
outside. If you live in a one-story home and can safely handle
these suggestions, you might want to try some of the following
tips yourself. If your roof is not easily accessible, we recommend
you call in a professional.

<p><UL>
<LI>Try to remove excessive snow from the roof. Most hardware
stores carry special &quot;roof rakes&quot; that can help.

<LI>If you notice a layer of ice forming over your gutters, try
to hook up a hose to your hot water. Administering hot water
should melt the ice and clear your gutters at the same time.
</UL>

<P>

<P><B>When driving</B>

<p><UL>
<LI>Take care pulling out of streets blocked by mountains of snow.
 It's often difficult to see who or what is coming.

<LI>Back your car into the driveway so you have better vision
when pulling out.

<LI>Be aware of joggers on the street.  Often sidewalks are impassable
and die-hard joggers venture onto the street for a clearer path. 
Unfortunately, they may not see icy spots or other hazards hidden
below the slush.

<LI>Don't turn corners too tightly.
</UL>

<P>

<P><B>When Sledding</B>

<UL>

<LI>Always sit on your sled.  This equipment is not constructed
for tricks such as standing or kneeling.

<LI>If you get out of control, roll off the sled.

<LI>Don't overload the sled with too many people.

<LI>Don't walk up sled trails as others are sledding down.
</UL>

<P>

<P><B>Protecting Your Home When It All Starts to Melt</B>
<UL>
<LI>Remove snow from the area near your foundation.  A three foot
clearing around your home's perimeter should do.  If this seems
a bit drastic, you might want to at least clear the snow away
from areas near where your basement has a history of leaks.
<LI>Clear downspouts.  Sometimes ice forms at the bottom of the
spouts, or they remain covered by snow.  There's no place for
the melting snow from your roof to go...except possibly under
your roof, then inside your home.  If you can't clear the bottom
of your downspouts, try removing them at the point they connect
to your roof.
<LI>Expose nearby sewers that have been covered by snow.  Melting
snow and rain need to go somewhere.  Blocked sewers can lead to
serious flooding conditions.
</UL>

<br><br>
July 1, 1996
<br><br><br>
Dear Valued Customer,
<P>
I am pleased to welcome you to the new Travelers Indemnity Company/Aetna Casualty and Surety Company. As you may know, these two companies combined their property and casualty insurance businesses creating  one of the largest U.S. insurers. This brought together the finest people, technology, and products the industry has to offer. <B>Our new company means better service for you, our customer.</B>
<P>
Over the next several months, you'll see some changes occurring as we complete our integration efforts.  A goal of our new company is to provide our customers with the best auto and homeowners policies in the market.   To achieve that goal, we will stay abreast of developments in the marketplace and implement changes as necessary to meet the needs of our customers. 
<p>
For former customers of <b>The Aetna Casualty and Surety Company</b> and its subsidiaries, the most notable change will be your receipt of a new Travelers Automobile policy to replace your old one.  You will receive this new policy on your annual anniversary  date <b>beginning in the second quarter of 1997</b>.  Our Indiana Auto customers, however, will begin receiving new Travelers policies in August 1996.  Homeowners customers can expect to see very little changes with the exception of some enhancements to certain coverages on your policy.  Any changes to your policy will also take place on your annual anniversary  date <b>beginning in the third quarter of 1997</b>.
<p>
For former <b>Travelers</b> customers, you will see very few changes to your Auto policy with the exception of some enhancements to certain coverages.  Any changes to your policy will take place on your annual anniversary  date <b>beginning in the second quarter of 1997</b>.  Again, our Indiana Auto customers will begin seeing these changes in August 1996.   For Homeowners customers, the most notable change will be your receipt of a new Homeowners policy to replace your old Travelers policy.  You will receive this new policy on your annual anniversary date <b>beginning in the third quarter of 1997</b>.
<p>
Rest assured that no matter what company you were previously insured by, we will provide you with a <b>detailed description</b> of any changes when we issue your new policy.
<p>
Some things, however, won't change. You will continue to have the flexible billing options you've come to expect. Your options will be explained on your new bill that will arrive approximately 18 days before your effective date. In addition, your agent is still there to provide for all your insurance needs. He or she is always ready to help.  As you receive your new policy, <b>please review it carefully</b>. If you have questions about your new policy, just call your agent or insurance representative.
<p>
You'll also continue to receive the same great claim service you've come to expect from us.  Customers and agents of The Travelers Indemnity Company should continue to report claims and track their progress by calling  1-800-CLAIM-33 (1-800-252-4633). Likewise, customers and agents of The Aetna Casualty and Surety Company should continue to call 1-800-238-6225.
<p>
In closing, I want to thank you for allowing us to continue to service your personal insurance needs. We are committed to providing the finest protection and service in the industry. If there is any way we can improve upon our service to you, please do not hesitate to <a href="../../mail/personal.html">let us know</a>. We are committed to maintaining  good two-way communication with our customers.  Check this Web site often for the latest news concerning our integration efforts.
<P>
Sincerely,
<br><br>

<p>Safe driving is everyone's responsibility.  Consider that over half of all motor vehicle accidents could be avoided if drivers would just make intelligent driving decisions.  Teenagers are most at risk because they may not have the experience or maturity to be able to consider the consequences of their actions.  It's critical that good driving habits are formed early...they can last you a lifetime!

<P>Teens and their parents should take a few moments to review the following sections.  Hopefully, they'll get you thinking about things you can do to make your driving as safe as possible:

<p>
<UL>
<LI>Statistics that make you think twice
<LI>Ways to reduce your risk of accidents
<LI>Ways to Keep Insurance Costs for Teens as Low as Possible
</UL>

<H3>Consider these sobering statistics on teen driving:</H3>

<p>
<UL>
<LI>Automobile accidents are the <B>number one killer</B> of our nation's youth.
<LI>Drivers <B>under the age of 20</B> were involved in 13% of all accidents, yet they account for only 5% of all drivers.
<LI>5,000 teenagers <B>die</B> each year from auto accidents.
<LI><B>Alcohol</B> is responsible for almost half of all teen motor vehicle deaths.
<LI>25% of all teen accidents involve <B>speeding</B>.
<LI>Half of all teenage traffic fatalities occur between <B>6:00 p.m. Friday and 3:00 a.m. Sunday</B>.
<LI>In one year, drivers 19 and under were involved in close to <B>3 million</B> motor vehicle accidents.
<LI>The <B>price</B> of a bad decision can include injury to yourself or others, loss of life, loss of life style or loss of personal freedom.

<H3>Ways to Prevent Accidents</H3>

<P>While no one has full control over the circumstances surrounding a motor vehicle accident, there are things that can be done to reduce your chances of being the cause or being involved in one.  Here are some smart decisions you can make while you're behind the wheel:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Drive defensively</B>.  If you assume that other drivers are not as skilled and thoughtful as you are, you will instinctively become more careful and cautious when on the road.
<LI><B>Try not to speed</B>.  When you speed, you have less time to react, less time to make the right decision.
<LI><B>Never drink and drive</B>.  Alcohol can seriously impair your decision-making skills and reaction time.
<LI><B>Take</B> the keys away from friends who have been drinking.
<LI>Give friends <B>rides</B> home if they have been drinking.
<LI>Adults can <B>set an example</B> by practicing safe driving habits.
</UL>

<H3>Ways to Keep Insurance Premiums for Teens as Low as Possible</H3>

<P>A number of factors are taken into consideration when insurance companies set rates for automobile policies.  Among those factors are the type of vehicle and the age, gender and driving record of the insured.  Companies pay close attention to the number of accidents a driver has had and the traffic tickets (from speeding, running a stop sign, etc.) received.  In their view, past performance serves as a meter for future behavior -- therefore, these drivers pose a higher risk.

<P>While you have no control over your age or gender, you can influence your driving record by forming and maintaining good driving habits.  Here are some other ways you might be able to save on premiums:

<p>
<UL>
<LI><B>Are you a good student, B average or better?</B>  Most companies offer discounts for these students.
<LI><B>Complete a driver's training course</B>.  Teens who take Driver's Ed are considered safer drivers than the average teen.
<LI>The longer you drive, the more experienced you become.
</UL>

	ALT="Home Safety and Security Tips">

<p>Here are some tips to reduce your risks and protect yourself and your home.

<br clear=left>
<H2>Fire</H2>

<p>
<UL>
<LI>Use smoke detectors and test them often.    
<LI>Plan escape routes from your home and practice your plan.  
<LI>Educate yourself and family with a visit to a fire station during National Fire Prevention Week.  
<LI>Periodically check electrical cords on lamps, vacuums, small kitchen appliances, electrical tools, etc.  
</UL>

<P>In case of fire, remember the basics:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Don't panic; drop and roll; the freshest air is nearest the floor; never re-enter a burning building.  
<LI>Use fire-retarding roofing material.  
<LI>Clear brush on your property.  (Californians:  30 to 100 feet from your home is recommended.)  
<LI>Never smoke in bed (or while reclining on the couch if there's a chance you'll doze off).  
<LI>Store flammable items properly -- in their original containers and away from heat sources.
</UL>

<H2>Home safety</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Never hide keys outside.  
<LI>Ask neighbors to keep watch on your home when you vacation...and return the favor.  
<LI>Install adequate outdoor lighting.  
<LI>Post emergency numbers by all phones.  
<LI>Secure all windows, including those in the basement.  
<LI>Plan and maintain landscaping so doors and windows are never concealed.  
<LI>Attend crime prevention seminars hosted by local police or civic associations. 
<LI>Replace window and door locks installed by previous occupants.  
<LI>Purchase a home security system.  
<LI>Never let strangers into your home; check the identity of utility or service people.
</UL>

<H2>Hurricanes</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>When buying or building a home, hire a certified, knowledgeable home inspector who specializes in residential property.  
<LI>Use a builder who knows the right materials and building techniques required for high-wind areas.  
<LI>Talk with your family about evacuation plans, including who to contact or where to meet afterwards, in case you are separated.  
<LI>Bolt 3/4 inch plywood over windows or use masking or duct tape on panes to prevent shattering.  
<LI>Install window shutters that can be closed over the windows.  
<LI>Tie down or secure whatever can't be taken inside.  
<LI>When evacuation is recommended, <STRONG>leave your home</STRONG> -- and leave early to avoid jammed highways, high winds, and poor driving visibility.  
<LI>Before you leave, shut off your home's main power switch.  
<LI>Take special precautions for children (bring along a favorite toy or blanket), elderly family members (consider stress and mobility) and those who are on medication or a restricted diet.  
<LI>Remember that pets are usually not allowed at evacuation centers or hotels.

<IMG SRC="../../images/homepoli.gif" ALT="Homeowners policy credits"><br>
<p>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE=5 HSPACE=20 SRC="../../images/ltbulb.gif" alt="ligntbulb image">

Take a look at this list!  These are credits that insurance companies have come up with to help cut the cost of your insurance.  They don't do it because they're a bunch of really nice people (even though they are!).  These credits are given because you've done something to reduce your risks or you're a valuable customer they want to keep.<br>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#new">Newer home credit</A>
<LI><A HREF="#protdev">Protective device credit</A>
<LI><A HREF="#renewal">Renewal or long-term customer credits</A>
<LI><A HREF="#assoc">Homeowners association credit</A> 
<LI><A HREF="#nosmoke">Nonsmoker's credit</A>
<LI><A HREF="#mature">Mature insured credit</A> 
<LI><A HREF="#acctcred">Account credit</A>
</UL>

As I said, look them over, then talk to an independent agent if you think you should be getting credit for something and it isn't listed on your insurance bill or your renewal statement.  It could be that your insurance company or agent wasn't aware that the credit(s) should be applied.  Also, remember that not all of these credits are available from every insurance company or in every state and the name or the specifics of the credits themselves may differ from company to company.

<br><br><br><BR><BR><BR>
<hr>
<A NAME="new"></A>
<H3>Newer home credit</H3>
The age of your home may qualify you for savings because plumbing, heating, and electrical systems of newer homes have lower risks than outdated systems.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A NAME="protdev"></A><P>
<H3>Protective device credit</H3>
If your home has certain types of fire alarms, burglar alarms, locks, or smoke detectors, you've reduced your risk and may qualify for this credit.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A NAME="renewal"></A><P>
<H3>Renewal or long-term customer credits</H3>
You could get credit when you renew your policy, beginning with the first renewal or after you've been a policyholder for a designated number of years.  This is the valuable customer thing I mentioned.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A NAME="assoc"></A><P>
<H3>Homeowners association credit</H3>
Homes located in eligible homeowners associations may qualify for a credit.  This is because homeowners in an association are likely to have a stronger sense of community and tend to watch out for one another.  That means you've lowered your risks.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A NAME="nosmoke"></A><P>
<H3>Nonsmoker's credit</H3>
No smokers living in your home means less chance of fire and that means you get credit for reducing your risk.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A NAME="mature"></A><P>
<H3>Mature insured credit</H3>
If you or your spouse are retired, you could receive a credit on your policy.  Could be the insurance companies know how tough it can be living on a fixed income.  Actually it's because retired people are more likely to be home a good deal of the time and will be able to prevent trouble -- like smelling an unusual odor from the furnace and shutting it off before it backfires soot into the home.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<br><hr><br>
<A NAME="acctcred"></A><P>
<H3>Account credit</H3>
Credits may be available for policyholders who have more than one type of policy with the same insurance company.  The more good business you give the company, the more valuable you are.

<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<hr>
<A NAME="land"></A>
<H3>Have you insured your land?</H3>

<P>Meet with your agent to review your policy and be sure your land value isn't included in the amount of protection you have on your house (referred to as Coverage A by insurance companies).  Insure your home for the amount it would cost to replace it, but since home insurance policies don't provide protection for your land, it would be a waste of money to include its value in your Coverage A amount.  

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>   

<A NAME="eval"></A>
<H3>Re-evaluate your valuables</H3>

<P>If you bought additional insurance coverage for your valuable items, keep an eye on their value and adjust your coverage amount appropriately.  Otherwise, some items that have decreased in value may be over insured.

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>   

<A NAME="new"></A>
<H3>Renovating?  Building?  Buying a new home?</H3>

<P>Certain building materials may cost less to insure or may qualify you for discounts.  And choosing brick construction over a wooden frame structure -- or vice versa -- can make a difference if you live in areas where earthquakes or hurricanes happen.  Additionally, upgrading your electrical, plumbing, and heating systems could mean savings.  Talk to a builder or your insurance agent.

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>   

<A NAME="replace"></A>
<H3>Home replacement cost</H3>

<P>Losing your home can be awful, but not nearly as devastating as not having enough insurance coverage to rebuild it.  That's why insurance companies and agents encourage you to insure your home for 100% of its replacement value, and doing so may result in savings on the cost of your policy.  Be sure to discuss this detail with your agent.

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>   

<A NAME="where"></A>
<H3>Where do you live?</H3>

<P>The distance of your home from the nearest fire department, and the difficulty in actually finding your home (do you live off the beaten path?), may mean you'll pay more.  Additionally, if the risk of theft and vandalism in your neighborhood is high, your home may also cost more to insure.  And, because flood coverage isn't included in a home insurance policy, you'll have to buy a separate flood insurance policy to protect yourself against losses from flooding.

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>   

<A NAME="deductibles"></A>

<H3>Deductibles</H3>

<P>Ordinarily, the deductible amount (what you pay out of your own pocket before your insurance policy kicks in) on a homeowners policy is $250.  By choosing a higher deductible ($500, $750, $1,000 or higher), you'll have lower annual premium payments.

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>   

<A NAME="grouprate"></A>
<H3>Group rates</H3>

<P>An insurance company spends less money selling insurance to a group of individuals, rather than to each individual separately, and passes the savings onto their policyholders.  You may qualify for these discounted rates through your employer or your membership in a credit union, professional organization, or condo/home association.  Talk with your employer or an officer of your group.  

<P>If you work or belong to any of the following organizations, <STRONG>great news!</STRONG>  These organizations sponsor Travelers insurance as a benefit to their employees/members at discounted rates.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Memphis Area Teachers Credit Union
<LI>Connecticut Union of Telephone Workers
<LI>AAA Lehigh Valley
<LI>Connecticut State Federation of Teachers
<LI>Branch Banking and Trust
<LI>First Educators Credit Union
</UL>

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>   

<A NAME="fraud"></A>
<H3>Fraud</H3>

<P>Did you know that fraud costs you about ten cents for every dollar you spend on insurance?  Think about this:  If you own a home and two cars and pay $1,800 for insurance each year, you'll have spent $900 on fraud in just five years.  So, ask your state legislators to make the fight against insurance fraud one of their priorities.  Report insurance fraud to your insurance agent or local police when you see or suspect it.  Speak out against insurance fraud to your friends, family, and business associates.

Here's a great way to learn about fire safety in the home. 
To begin, just pick a room in the house.  As you go from room to room, you'll have only so 
many clicks to find what you think are the fire hazards. Can you find them all?

<A NAME="drive"></A>
<H3>Safe driving</H3>

<P>Most importantly, maintain a good driving record. You can save as much as 60% over drivers who cause accidents.

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>   

<A NAME="deductible"></A>
<H3>Deductibles</H3>

<P>A common deductible amount (what you pay out of your own pocket before your insurance policy kicks in) ranges from $200 - $300.  Choosing a higher deductible can mean paying less for your policy.  Consider the rising costs of car repairs and what you can afford to pay out of your own pocket.

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>   

<A NAME="car"></A>
<H3>What type of car do you own?</H3>

<P>A car that is practical, safe to drive, and inexpensive to repair (relatively speaking!) will cost less to insure. High-performance cars (that hot sports car you've always longed for!), expensive cars that are costly to repair, and cars that are likely to be stolen will, of course, cost more to insure.  Check on crash-test reports and repair records of a car you are considering, too, as well as manufacturer recalls.  A consumer protection magazine can be very useful.

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>   

<A NAME="elimcov"></A>
<H3>Eliminate coverages</H3>

<p>If you drive an older car with little cash value, consider eliminating "collision" and "comprehensive" coverage from your policy.  If the cost to repair body damage to an older car is more than the value of the car itself, the insurance company with appraise the car as "totaled" and give you only the amount of the car's value.  Be sure you're not over insured!  

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>   

<A NAME="grouprate"></A>
<H3>Group rates</H3>

<P>If you work, or belong to an association or credit union, you might qualify for reduced auto rates.  That's because insurance companies spend less money selling to a group of individuals, rather than to each person separately, passing the savings onto their policyholders.  Check it out with your employer, association or credit union.

<P>If you work or belong to any of the following organizations, <STRONG>great news!</STRONG>  These organizations sponsor Travelers insurance as a benefit to their employees/members at discounted rates.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Memphis Area Teachers Credit Union
<LI>Connecticut Union of Telephone Workers
<LI>AAA Lehigh Valley
<LI>Connecticut State Federation of Teachers
<LI>Branch Banking and Trust
<LI>First Educators Credit Union
</UL>

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>   

<A NAME="fraud"></A>
<H3>Fraud</H3>

<P>Did you know that fraud costs you about ten cents for every dollar you spend on insurance?  Think about this:  If you own a home and two cars and pay $1,800 for insurance each year, you'll have spent $900 on fraud in just five years.  So, ask your state legislators to make the fight against insurance fraud one of their priorities.  Report insurance fraud to your insurance agent or local police when you see or suspect it.  Speak out against insurance fraud to your friends, family, and business associates.

<p>Nice long list of ways to save money, don't you think?  These are credits insurance companies have come up with to give you a break on the cost of auto insurance.  They offer them because you've done something to reduce your risk or you're a valuable customer they want to keep.

<P>I've described these credits in general terms so check with an independent agent to find out the details of credits your auto insurer offers.  He or She will also be able to tell you which credits are available in your state, too, because these credits aren't available everywhere.

<hr>
<A NAME="acctcred"></A>
<H3>Account Credit</H3>
You could save money if you have more than one type of policy with the same insurance company (for example, an auto policy and a homeowners policy).  The more good business you give the company, the more valuable you are as a customer.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<P>
<hr>
<A NAME="antilock"></A><P>
<H3>Anti-lock Brake Credit</H3>
Anti-lock brakes are an automatic safety feature that reduces your risk and that means you could qualify for a credit on your policy.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<P>
<hr>
<A NAME="antitheft"></A><P>
<H3>Anti-theft Credit</H3>
These security features could qualify you for credit because you've reduced your risk:<P>
<UL>
<LI>alarms and active disabling devices (systems that you need to turn on) permanently installed in your auto
<LI>a passive disabling device (automatically kicks in when you remove the key from the ignition)
<LI>keyless devices (like a remote door lock on your key chain)
<LI>tubular locks (like a bar that locks on your steering wheel)
</UL>
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<P>
<hr>
<A NAME="carpool"></A><P>
<H3>Car Pool Credit</H3>
Do you commute to work and home in a car pool with two or more people?  You'll save more than the cost of gas and car maintenance.  You could qualify for a credit on your auto policy, too!  That's because you'll use your car less often, especially during the busy, stressful morning and evening hours when your chance of an accident is greater.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<P> 
<hr>
<A NAME="defdriv"></A><P>
<H3>Defensive Driver Credit</H3>
Drivers at least 55 years old who have completed a state-approved defensive driver or accident prevention course could qualify for savings.  This credit may be good for only a certain number of years from the completion date of the course.  
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<P> 
<hr>
<A NAME="drvtrain"></A><P>
<H3>Driver Training Credit</H3>
A driver under the age of 21 who has taken a driver training course could qualify for savings.  That's because the better the driver, the lower the risk.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<P>
<hr>
<A NAME="forgive"></A><P>
<H3>Forgiveness Credit</H3>
Once you've had your auto policy for a certain number of years, your first minor traffic accident (like a fender bender) that is estimated below a certain dollar amount may not be marked against you.  It won't affect the cost of your insurance either.  Hey, accidents happen, right?
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<P> 
<hr>
<A NAME="student"></A><P>
<H3>Good Student Credit</H3>
If a driver in your household is younger than 25 years old and is a full-time student with a B average, you could qualify for a credit.  This may be because a conscientious student is more than likely a conscientious driver!
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<P> 
<hr>
<A NAME="lossfree"></A><P>
<H3>Loss Free Credit</H3>
Some insurance companies will give you a credit if you haven't made any claims during the first few years that you've had your policy.  Being a good customer and a low risk applies here!
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<P>
<hr>
<A NAME="lowmile"></A><P>
<H3>Low Mileage Credit</H3>
The amount of miles you travel in a year could mean you'll get a credit on your policy, depending on how low that mileage figure is.  That's because the lower the miles on the road, the lower the risk of an accident.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<P>
<hr>
<A NAME="mature"></A><P>
<H3>Mature Driver Discount</H3>
Some companies offer credits for drivers over the age of 55.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<P> 
<hr>
<A NAME="multicar"></A><P>
<H3>Multi-car Credit</H3>
Insuring more than one car with your auto insurance company may make you eligible for savings.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<P> 
<hr>
<A NAME="passrestr"></A><P>
<H3>Passive Restraint Credit</H3>
Most insurance companies will give you credit if your car has air bags, automatic seat belts, or other safety features that you don't have to turn on or buckle up manually.  These features automatically reduce your risk.
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<P> 
<hr>
<A NAME="renewal"></A><P>
<H3>Renewal Credit</H3>
Once you've had your auto policy for a certain number of years, you'll begin to get a credit each year you renew.  (It's the good customer thing again.)
<P>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>
<P> 
<hr>
<A NAME="away"></A><P>
<H3>Student Away Credit</H3>
You could get credit if a driver in your household is a student away at a school located more than 100 miles from your home and doesn't have a car.  That driver's risk is lowered because his or her time behind the wheel is reduced.
<P>

<hr>
<A NAME="deductibles"></A>
<h3 align=left>Deductibles</h3>

<p>A deductible is the amount of risk that you are willing to assume in case of a loss.  The higher your deductible, the lower your insurance premium.  Boat and yacht deductibles are usually determined as a percentage of your coverage and can range from 1% to 10%, depending on the type and speed of the vessel.  For example, if your deductible is 1% of $20,000 of coverage, you would pay the first $200 of the loss.  When selecting the deductible on your policy, consider how much financial loss you are willing to assume.  Also consider how much premium you could save by choosing a higher deductible amount.  Your independent insurance agent can help you determine the deductible amount that best fits your needs.

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<A NAME="rating"></A>
<H3 align=left>Rating Factors</H3>

<p>Insurers consider the following factors when rating your boat and yacht insurance:
<ul>
<p>
<li><b>Age of Boat:</b> One of the first factors an insurer looks at is the age of your boat.  Newer boats benefit from lower premium rates because they pose a lower risk than older boats with outdated equipment and systems.  Also, over time your boat or yacht loses its value (pretty much like your car!).  Therefore, the cost to replace or repair an older boat or yacht goes up!  That higher cost and higher risk is reflected in your premiums.

<p>
<li><b>Where You Sail:</b> Underwriters look at a number of conditions to determine the amount of risk that is presented by the type of waters you navigate:

<p>
1. Weather conditions:  Is the area prone to a lot of hurricanes or tropical storms?  For example, New England vs. Florida.

<p>
2. Congestion levels:  Are the waters quiet (like Lake Winnipesaukee) or are they crowded with traffic (like Long Island Sound)?

<p>
3. Type of water:  Is the boat sailed on coastal or inland waters?  Obviously, these waters pose different levels of risk.

<p>
4. Theft:  Some areas have higher incidents of theft and are rated accordingly.

<p>
<li><b>Kind of Boat:</b> Is your boat a high-performance or non-performance watercraft?  As in auto insurance, companies look at the type of boat or yacht you captain to determine the level of risk.  In fact, most companies will only provide insurance protection for standard, conventional boats and yachts.  Generally, substandard vessels like jet skis and jet boats are only insured by specialty market insurers who specialize in these types of risks.

<p>
<li><b>Your Driving Record:</b> Since almost anyone can operate a boat, insurers look at your motor vehicle driving record to help them determine the type of boat or yacht operator you are.  Underwriters also consider your age, years of sailing experience and past boating accidents.
</ul>

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<A NAME="credits"></A>
<H3 align=left>Money-Saving Credits are Available</H3>

<p>Some companies, like Travelers, demonstrate their commitment to safe boating by offering a premium credit for policies where <b>all</b> the operators have successfully completed a Boating Safety course such as those offered by the Power Squadron or Coast Guard Auxiliary basic or advanced seamanship course. Copies of certificates are required. Newer boats and yachts also benefit from lower premium rates.

<p>Your local, independent agent can help you determine whether these savings are offered for your policy.

<head><TITLE>Travelers Auto Theft Prevention Tips</TITLE></head>

<BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT hspace=20 SRC="../../images/stolen.gif"><IMG SRC="../../images/thief.gif" ALT="Stop Thief!">

<p>In the time it takes you to read this, a thief could break into your car, hot-wire it and drive away.  If you think it won't happen to you, consider these facts!
<br clear=left>

<p>
<UL>
<LI>Every 19 seconds, a car is stolen in America.
<LI>The number of cars stolen this year would be enough to fill the parking lots of 170 major shopping centers.
<LI>The cost of car theft and looting is estimated to be more than $7 billion.</UL>

<P>Here are some things you can do to minimize the chances that this will happen to you.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Use common sense <EM>every time</EM> you leave your car.
<LI>Keep a record of your car's vehicle identification numbers (VIN) so you can identify it if it's stolen and recovered.
<LI>Close all windows, lock all doors and take your keys with you.  One in five stolen vehicles is left unlocked with the keys in the ignition -- and sometimes running.
<LI>Park in well-lighted areas near other vehicles or pedestrian traffic, especially at shopping malls.  More than two-thirds of auto thefts happen at night.
<LI>Park with your front tires turned sharply into the curb, with the emergency brake on, to make towing difficult.
<LI>Put packages and valuables in the trunk, out of sight, and consider anti-theft devices to protect your audio equipment.  One of six larcenies involves theft from a motor vehicle.
<LI>Lock your car and the garage door at home.  If you don't have a garage, back your car into your driveway and keep it locked.  Over half of all vehicle thefts occur in residential areas.
<LI>Have the vehicle identification number etched into your car windows.  Professional thieves will know your car can be traced easily.  Spots of paint or nail polish also can help identify your car.
<LI>Many police officers say the best low-tech implement is a hardened steel rod that locks the steering wheel in place.  Its mere visibility can deter thieves.
<LI>A burglar alarm system can be effective, but security experts recommend that it be more than just a noisemaker.  An alarm system should disable the starter, preventing the thief from driving away.
<LI>Investigate an anti-hot-wiring device that interrupts the ignition, starter or fuel systems, preventing start-up.
<LI>Install a kill switch that prevents starting by means of a hidden second ignition switch.
<LI>Consider a back-up battery that trips an alarm if the main power source is disconnected or if wires to the alarm are cut or disconnected.
<LI>Try an armored collar that wraps around the steering column to cover the ignition.</ul>

	ALT="Travelers Personal Property Inventory">
<p>
From the time we're small, each of us collects things.  At first, it's seashells
... or flowers.  Simple things that represent our discovery of the world around us.
As the years pass, we find new things to treasure.  Books.  Photographs.  Paintings.
Furniture.  Family heirlooms.
<p>
Whether large or small, expensive or merely dear to us - the possessions we acquire
over time say a great deal about us.
<p>
Today, you have a home filled with possessions of many kinds.  Some are functional.
Others are decorative, serving to enhance your surroundings.  Each of these
possessions tells something about your personal style.
<p>
Wisely, you want to protect the things that mean so much to you, so you carry homeowners 
or renters insurance.  But to be certain your valuable possessions are <i>fully</i>
covered against fire, theft, and other perils, you should take extra steps.  To begin,
many prudent homeowners and renters alike install such security devices as dead-bolt locks,
fire extinguishers, smoke alarms, and perhaps even fire and burglary alarm systems 
connected to a police or fire station. 
<p>
But it's important to go beyond that.  Another step toward protecting your personal
property - one that is often overlooked - is to create an <i>inventory</i> of your
home.  We believe that you should complement your home insurance plan with an
inventory of your personal possessions.  This Web page should help you take such an
inventory, easily and thoroughly.
<p>
When you've completed your inventory, make sure you have enough insurance to 
replace everything.  Your independent agent can help you determine whether your most 
treasured possessions are adequately protected by your Homeowners or Renters insurance.  If needed,
supplemental insurance coverages may be recommended to protect such property as 
jewelry, collections, antiques, china, crystal - even home computers!
<p>
This inventory will also be useful to you in the event of a loss.  Having this information
on hand makes it easier for you to file a complete and prompt claim, supported by accurate
documentation.  This in turn helps to determine the replacement cost * of your lost
or damaged possessions to settle your claim quickly.
<center><font size="-1"><i>* subject to the provisions of your Homeowners or Renters policy.</i></font></center>
<p>
<h3>How to begin</h3>
<p>
We've developed a simple <a href="./worksheet.html">worksheet</a> that you can print.
Make as many copies as you need ... one for each room of your home.  Simply walk
through each room and write down the items you see.  Take your time!  Be sure to list
all items of value, along with their year of purchase, original price, and current
estimated value.  If you don't have all of the relevant information at the time of 
your "walk-through", leave blanks and fill them in later after checking your purchase 
records.
<p>
As you record your possesions, don't forget:
<ul>
<li>fireplace accessories, air conditioners and stereo equipment which you may have in your living room.
<li>table linens and decorative items which may be in your dining room.
<li>bar equipment, including wines and liquors; toys, etc. in your recreation or family room.
<li>window accessories, floor coverings and valuable light fixture you may have placed in your halls, sun-rooms or porches.
<li>mirrors, small electrical appliances such as toothbrushes, water pics, shavers and hairsetters, scales, cosmetics and medicines in the bathroom.
<li>clothing and bed linens in the bedroom(s)
<li>pots and pans, disposals, small electrical appliances such as blenders, can openers, food processors and similar items; cleaning utensils such as mops and brooms in the kitchen.
<li>tools, auto equipment; barbecue equipment, fans, freezers, garden tools, holiday decorations, painting equipment, swimming pool accessories and vacuum cleaners from the attic, basement or garage.
<li>arts and crafts supplies and equipment, board games, bicycles, exercise equipment and kid's toys. 
</ul>
<p>
As you're completing your inventory, take the opportunity to mark valuable items such
as TVs, VCRs, cameras, etc., with an indelible identification number recognizable to 
police.  Your state's initials plus your driver's license, your area code and phone 
number, or your Social Security number could help authorities identify and return 
items if they were lost or stolen.
<p>
Do you own a number of "priceless" items, such as antique jewelry or original works 
of art?  If so, it's wise to have these appraised to establish their value.  This will
help ensure that, in the event of a loss, you receive an insurance settlement that
is appropriate to the true value of these items.  An independent agent can work with 
you to determine the right kind of coverage for these special items.  Penny also has 
lots of information on protecting these special items in her 
<a href="../covered/coverage.html">Coverage Section</a>.
<p>
<h3>A photgraphic record of your belongings</h3>
<p>
Photographs are an important supplement to your written inventory because they give
details that written descriptions cannot.  In addition, they document the quality, 
appearance, and size of the things you own.  Here are some additional things to keep in
mind:
<p>
<UL>
<li>Use a camera you are comfortable with, but be certain to use color film.  Color
film will best show the true characteristics and quality of your possessions.  If you 
have a VCR and video camera, you can create an especially valuable photgraphic record
of your home and possessions.  A video of each room in your home, as well as hallways, 
porches, gardens and shrubbery, will help establish the general appearance and 
quality of your home in addition to documenting your personal possessions.
<p>
<li>Photograph <i>systematically</i>.  Start with one wall in the living room, taking
as many photographs as necessary to record the entire room's contents.  Then do the 
same with all of the other rooms in your home.
<p>
<li>Don't forget to open closets.  Even though photographs can't document the 
quality of your wardrobe, they do record the quantity.
<p>
<li>Your basement, garage or attic may not hold valuable items, but they do hold
items you would need to replace in the event of a major loss.  Check each of these 
locations for items that should be photographed such as power tools, lawn furniture,
laundry appliances, etc.
<p>
<li>Valuable small items such as silverware, furs, china or crystal, as well as 
larger items such as sculptures, paintings or collections must be recorded with extra care.
Lay small items out on a plain cloth or rug, next to a ruler (to establish actual
size).  Try to photograph at close range in order to include as many of the visual
details as possible.  Turn over a single piece of china or silver to show the hallmark,
manufacturer and pattern name.
<p>
<li>As soon as you receive your finished prints, mark each with the name of the 
item(s) and their location in your home (as recorded in your written inventory).
<p>
<li>When you acquire new items, be sure to photograph them and add them to your
written inventory.
<p>
<li>Keep the photos with your inventory.  Be certain to store them in a safe place
<i>outside your home</i>, such as a safe deposit box.  Check with your agent to see
if they can place a copy of your inventory with your other records in their files.
<p>
<li>If you own a second residence, such as a summer cottage or beach house, you 
should complete a separate inventory for that residence.
</ul> 
<p>
Remember, once you are all done, compare the estimated value of your possessions
to the amount of insurance you have.  Don't wait until after they are lost or damaged
find out you don't have enough coverage.  See your independent insurance agent and
make sure your valuable possessions have the protection they deserve.

<I><B> "I testify today not only as a health professional with a certain expertise in occupational and environmental reproductive health hazards, but also as a clinician acutely sensitive to the complex social and emotional issues that reproductive problems raise ... Some of our most important scientific breakthroughs in occupational medicine occurred because we took seriously and investigated the complaints of a few individuals with health problems about which we knew very little. In fact, in the 1970s, the entire notion that the reproductive health of men could be affected by toxic exposures came about because a few workers exposed to the pesticide dibromochloropropane dared speak about their sexual problems and infertility. Given the significant frequency of adverse reproductive and developmental problems in the U.S., the causes of which remain largely unknown, I believe it is incumbent upon us as scientists and public officials to make every effort to increase our understanding of the conditions and their etiologies. The subject of reproductive health hazards deserves serious attention and research."</B>

<H4><font color = purple>An Infancy of Science</font></H4>
Over and over again, we are revisited by the haunt of Alvin Tofler's Future Shock: the technology that brings us continual change in the way we live far outpaces our understanding of its potential consequences... including its science. We are, in many respects, only in an infancy in our understanding of the human health consequences of the fast paced, high-tech revolution in which developed nations live, thrive, and compete. This includes an infancy in our understanding of the consequences of industrial chemicals on human reproductive and developmental systems. In Our Stolen Future, we are reminded that "we waited too long to ask the right questions" about a number of chemicals in use for many years before they were banned for having posed adverse human health risks. Yet, every year, hundreds of new chemicals enter the market, and we know little about most. It is estimated that less than 6% of all chemicals in commercial use today have been tested for reproductive implications. Every day, millions of workers are exposed to industrial chemicals, and yet, the extent to which occupational exposures produce adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes is largely unknown. Some suggest the problem is both widespread and serious and that efforts to prevent occupational disorders of reproduction face major gaps in knowledge. In light of the fact that hundreds of new chemicals enter the market every day and that reproductive disorders carry a multi-billion dollar U.S. healthcare tag, this raises a call for responsible response. 

<H4><font color = purple>In Pursuit of Knowledge- A Deep & Complex Interconnection: The Wingspread Convention</font></H4>

Over the past several years, there has been a keen and growing interest in better understanding the affects of industrial or synthetic chemicals on the human reproductive system. In the midst of this interest is an emergence of scientific research on industrial chemicals as disrupters of the endocrine/ hormone system. The hormone system plays a critical role in the processes of reproduction and development. While scientists are in an infancy in exploring the implications of research to date, a number of animal and several human studies have linked or are suggesting links between certain industrial chemicals and the risks posed to human reproduction and development.<p>

In July 1991, a group of 21 scientists from the U.S. and abroad convened, for the first time, to discuss their findings on the affects of industrial chemicals (including those found in pesticides, plastics, detergents, toiletries, phthalates- used in paints, inks, and adhesives) on reproductive and developmental systems, based on both animal and human studies. Among other things, they noted a global decline in male sperm count (by 50% over the past 50 years) and cognitive deficits in children. As a body of knowledge, the research findings present a consensual message about the prevalence and effect of hormone-disrupting industrial chemicals on normal reproductive and developmental processes, with adverse consequences for human health. These hormone disrupters are said to pose a special threat in that their effects can be latent in causing human health outcomes.<p>

Concerned by their collective studies and findings, this group issued the "Wingspread Consensus Statement." Several convictions underlie the Statement, including that: (1) in hormone/ endocrine system studies, man and animal are deeply interconnected and share a complex evolutionary legacy, such that animal studies of chemical-hormone disrupters on reproductive and developmental processes have equal relevance to humans; (2) a level of research needs to be redirected away from "cancer"/ carcinogenic risk assessment towards teratogenic (embryo/fetal physical developmental defects) and mutagenic (genetic cell) risk assessments, if we are to understand reproductive health hazards; and (3) policy based on the scientific "weight of the evidence," and not scientific "proof," is a prudent standard for protecting human reproductive health. The Statement is intended to serve as a starting point for scientists, policy makers, and others to help direct research and public policy-making around the potential reproductive health hazards posed by hormone-disrupting industrial chemicals. <p>

The Wingspread findings and messages are not without controversy. At the center of the controversy is the age-long debate over the relevance of animal studies for humans. While one school of scientists holds that in studies specifically of hormone disrupters on the endocrine system, animal studies are relevant to humans, the other school contends that animal studies have no human, epidemiological relevance and cannot be extrapolated to human implications. The scientific case is still emerging. Regardless of the debate, the research to date has been compelling enough that the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has established an expert panel to assess the potential risks of synthetic chemicals to human reproduction, including to infertility and birth defects. Now... from many corners... there is a widespread call for more understanding... more research. <p>

<H4><font color = purple>A Quiet Issue On the Surface; A Growing Research Priority</font></H4>

Among those involved in the call for more research and scientific investigation are NIOSH, OSHA, EPA, and the American Industrial Hygiene Association. Over the past few years, each has identified reproductive hazards in the workplace as a major research priority. For NIOSH, this has been a research priority since the 1980s, when CDC had ranked reproductive disorders in the U.S. among the ten leading work-related illnesses and injuries. Two years ago, the National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety & Health recommended that NIOSH not only conduct research, but also develop guidelines around reproductive hazards. Even among NIOSH stakeholders (business and industry, academics, trade associations), there is a "remarkable degree of consensus" that reproductive hazards is a priority issue for research. As a result, NIOSH's 1996 "National Occupational Research Agenda" (NORA) lists "fertility and pregnancy abnormalities" as one of its "disease and injury" research priorities. OSHA also has identified reproductive hazards as a priority for non-regulatory activity in its "Priority Planning Process." Likewise, EPA has targeted the issue as a top priority, with more stringent rules for testing chemicals for possible human reproductive system affects. Both EPA and NIOSH have acknowledged, independently (and in line with the Wingspread Consensus Statement), that an understanding of hormone disrupters must be included in any study aimed to understand possible reproductive hazards in the workplace and environment. A quiet issue on the surface, this has become an important public policy and occupational issue for many involved in the protection of human health and life.  

<H4><font color = purple>A Public Evolution of the Concern</font></H4>

The health concern over the potential teratogenic effects of industrial chemicals on human reproduction has been mounting over the past thirty years. The momentum began in the public health arena with adverse reproductive health effects after thalidomide exposures in the 1960s, and continued with DES, methylmercury, and Love Canal in the 1970s. In the 1970s-1980s, miscarriage clusters were reported in the occupational context in the Silicon Valley semiconductor industry and again, along with birth defects, among VDT users in the office setting. Male sterility also was reported by pesticide handlers of dibromochloropropane. Reproductive concerns continue to emerge. Among these are worker exposures to glycol ethers, PCEs, organic mercury, and 1-3 butadiene. A more recent concern is that of occupational cosmic radiation exposure. The FAA and NIOSH are studying high northern route flights and reproductive health effects in female flight attendants, concerned that cosmic radiation exposure prominent on northern routes may cause fetal damage. <p>

As a Nation, in lagging in our past scientific understanding of occupational reproductive affects of lead, organic solvents, radiation, glycol ethers, anesthetic gases, among others... long after the substances came into the market..., so also have we lagged as a Nation in protecting human health. The saga continues. In a recent $188 million lawsuit alleging male and female reproductive cancers from chemicals used in the computer chip-making process, the question has been asked again... only not of the employer...  but of the manufacturers: why isn't testing done before chemicals are brought "through the plant door" and used "on the assembly line?"<p>

<H4><font color = purple>Scope of the Problem: Many Potentially Exposed</font></H4>

All these events have heightened our awareness of reproductive hazards and have placed it at centerstage as a public policy and occupational issue. In the U.S. alone, reproductive disorders carry a multibillion dollar price tag. Reproductive disorders include low sperm counts, infertility, impotence, genital deformities, cancers of the breast and prostate gland, endometriosis, menstrual disorders, spontaneous abortions, low birth weight, preterm births, birth defects and a number of developmental disabilities and neurological disorders in children. <p>

While some specific occupational reproductive hazards have been identified, most of the more than 1,000 workplace chemicals that have shown abnormal reproductive effects in animals have not been studied in humans. In addition to these, there are 90,000 chemicals and 4 million chemical mixtures in widespread commercial use today in Western nations, most of which remain untested for reproductive or developmental toxicity. In fact, it is believed that only 6% of all chemicals in commercial use have been tested for reproductive risk. Only 40 or so chemical, physical and biological agents are generally recognized as human teratogens. OSHA regulates only two- lead and radiation- as known reproductive hazards. In addition, the effects of other workplace hazards such as stress, noise, ergonomics, and shift work on the reproductive system are not well understood.<p>

Not only do we know but little about the etiology of reproductive hazards, but the total number of workers potentially exposed to known or suspected reproductive hazards is also unknown. NIOSH says this number is "considerable." Some federal estimates put the number over 14,000,000 workers. What IS known is that 75% of employed women and an even greater percentage of employed men are of reproductive age. More than 50% of U.S. children are born to working mothers.<p>
In the U.S., infertility is estimated to affect more than 2 million couples (1 in 12). For those infertile couples who sought help in 1987, about $1 billion was spent on care. Coupled with the scientific research suggesting industrial chemicals are suspect in significant global decline of male sperm counts, the high cost and frequency of infertilities in the U.S. only serves to intensify the  exposure concern in the occupational context. <p>

In addition to infertilities, an estimated 560,000 infant deaths, spontaneous abortions, and stillbirths occur annually in the U.S. Increased rates of miscarriage have been found in women workers exposed to a variety of agents such as anesthetic gases, organic solvents, lead, and ethylene oxide. Some research also suggests that male exposures to these agents and certain occupations (electrical and petrochemical) can affect pregnancy outcomes, including increased rates of miscarriages and an increased risk for childhood cancers. Every year in the U.S., about 200,000 live babies are born with some type of birth defect, of which 120,000 (3 per 100) are born with a major birth defect. Additionally, 17% of all children have some type of developmental disability, which could include cerebral palsy. The 1992 cost for 17 of the most clinically important structural birth defects and for cerebral palsy was estimated to be about $8 billion. Birth defects are also the leading cause of infant mortality in the U.S., accounting for 20% of infant deaths (more than 8,000) annually. Yet, 65%- 70 % of birth defects and developmental disabilities are of unknown cause.<p>

<H4><font color = purple>Closing Remark: Putting Prudent Precaution Before the Science</font></H4>

The overall contribution of workplace exposures to male and female reproductive disorders and birth defects is not known. Existing data from animal and human studies suggest that occupational and environmental agents can cause a number of reproductive problems in adults and a range of abnormalities in fetal and childhood development. Well-designed research is needed to better identify and understand industrial chemicals, how they affect biological systems, and effect human health consequences. Some international organizations believe that the case against chemicals- while incomplete- is "sufficiently sturdy to begin taking steps to limit human exposure." "Prudent precaution" is advised by a number of legal and safety professionals. Some reproductive hazard policies and practices <em><strong>at a minimum</strong></em> include:<p>
<ul>
<li>Removing or replacing toxic substances to the extent feasible.
<li>Full compliance with OSHA-PELs, and controls, including appropriate PPE and reducing worker exposure through administrative and engineering controls, including improved ventilation, enclosure or isolation of the process.
<li>Where feasible, use ACGIH's TLVs or NIOSH RELs, which are generally more protective, as guidance for establishing employee exposure levels. 
<li>Development of  a written company policy to reduce exposure levels to as low as is reasonably achievable.
<li>Full compliance with HazCom, including labeling- (target organ  and safety precautions); and worker training with employee haz-   
<li>	ard notification repeated at least annually.
<li>Availability of MSDSs at locations and times convenient to employees.
</ul>
<p>
Employers also must take care to administer equitable and effective company policies when dealing with job position and transfer issues where potential reproductive risk exposures may exist. Lessons from Johnson Controls suggest that reproductive hazard notice and temporary job transfer options be made to both males and females and provide voluntary election of work alternative options. In Johnson Controls, the Supreme Court held that a battery manufacturer's fetal protection policy (to protect women from lead exposure by excluding them from jobs where their health or that of their offspring could be compromised), was discriminatory and violated federal civil rights laws. Although it is believed that, under Johnson Controls, employers may minimize tort claims by giving proper warnings to female employees and by providing safe workplace controls, case law is lacking on legal protections against fetal tort claims brought by infants alleging harm from in utero exposure to reproductive hazards, since a parent may not have the right to waive a child's right to bring suit.<p>

Given the significance of adverse reproductive and developmental problems in the U.S., the causes of which remain largely unknown, the subject of reproductive health hazards has gained the research attention of many involved in protecting public and occupational health.

<p>All too often I hear about a boat owner who assumed that his Homeowners insurance provided complete protection for his vessel.  Unfortunately, many learn the hard way -- after a loss occurs -- that their Homeowners offers only limited property and liability protection to boat owners.  In fact, the basic Homeowners policy only provides about $1,000 of physical damage protection for small boats.

<p>Even with the Hull Coverage endorsement (an optional add-on coverage to a Homeowners policy offered by some companies such as Aetna), boat owners can only receive up to $7,500 for covered losses (in most states).  Plus, the policy settles on an Actual Cash Value basis only.  Often this is just not enough to repair your boat.

<p>If you have made the investment to own and operate a boat, you may need the full range of protection offered by Boat Insurance.  Just as you should not drive a car without auto insurance, you should not operate a boat without first looking into the protection and peace-of-mind offered by Boat Insurance.

<p>The following section will help you navigate through the unfamiliar waters of Boat Insurance:

<h3>What Types of Boats Qualify?</h3>

<p>Most Boat Insurance programs (like the Travelers Commander Pleasure Boat policy) are designed to cover boats from 16' to 25' 11" in overall length.  Boats eligible for this insurance must be valued at $3,000 or higher and include outboard powered boats, inboard powered boats, sailboats (with or without power) and outdrive powered boats.  Non-powered boats (such as canoes, rowboats, and pedal boats) are also eligible but only for inland water use.

<p>If the size of your vessel is 26 feet or greater, it's generally considered a yacht, and therefore qualifies for Yacht coverage.  Click here if you'd like to learn about the fore and aft of Yacht Insurance 101.

<a name="physical"> </a>

<h3>Physical Damage Coverage</h3>

<p>
This important coverage pays to repair your boat if it's accidentally damaged or destroyed by a covered peril (such as fire, theft, windstorm, lightning or vandalism).  Physical Damage coverage is very broad, with a few exclusions such as wear and tear, dishonest, illegal, intentional or fraudulent acts.

<p>
When you purchase Boat Insurance, one of your primary objectives is to protect your investment.  Boat Insurance can provide coverage for your:
<ul>
<li> Boat (including machinery)
<li> Outboard motors
<li> Auxiliary equipment
<li> Dinghy (if under 16 feet and under 25 h.p.)
<li> Boat Trailer
<li> Personal property kept aboard your boat.
</ul>

<p>
What's more, you're usually covered for 12 months navigation anywhere within the 48 contiguous United States and Canada.  You're also covered while your boat is in transit over land anywhere within the 48 contiguous United States and Canada.  

<p>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="agreed"> </a>

<h3>Agreed Value</h3>

<p>
Boats under 15 years old are typically insured on an agreed value basis.  This means the company will pay you the full amount for which your boat is insured in the event of a total loss.  The agreed value is the amount that is shown on the policy and there is no deduction for depreciation.

<p>
Like cars, a boat's market value decreases over time.  For this reason, the most you are allowed to insure your boat for is its fair market value.  In most cases, insurance companies re-evaluate the market value of the boat every three years.  Therefore, the agreed value listed on your policy will more closely reflect the current market value of your boat as it ages.

<p>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="newforold"> </a>

<h3>New for Old (used for a Partial Loss)</h3>

<p>
In the event of a partial loss, where there is less serious damage, property claims are handled in the following way:  damaged property is repaired or replaced with no deduction for depreciation.  In other words, "new" equipment replaces "old" damaged goods.  Your policy should tell you how your insurer will settle claims for repairs or payment.

<p>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="actualcash"> </a>

<h3>Actual Cash Value (used for boats over 15 years old)</h3>

<p>
Actual Cash Value is an insurance term that agrees to pay the market value cost of your boat minus depreciation.  Once your boat is over 15 years old, most Boat policies revert to settling losses on an actual cash value basis.  Also, some policies only offer actual cash value for certain damaged property such as sails, protective covers, batteries, outboard motors, lower drive units or outdrives, dinghies and trailers (regardless of the age of the boat).

<p>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="whatsnot"> </a>

<h3>What's Not Covered</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Non-conventional watercraft like: hydrocycles, jet skis, kit boats, ski boats, etc.
<li>High-performance boats with advertised or design speed in excess of 50 MPH.
<li>Auxiliary equipment such as:
<ul>
<li>Outboard motors NOT listed in your policy
<li>Moorings, cradles, boat lifts or similar equipment
<li>Fishing tackle and scuba gear (however, most policies do offer protection for this equipment as a low-cost, optional coverage)
<li>Personal effects.  This includes items not intended for the normal operation of your boat, such as portable TVs, cellular or portable phones, stereos, radios and cameras.  For example, tools stored and used only in your boat may qualify as covered auxiliary equipment, whereas the same tools left in your car are considered to be personal effects.
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="deductibles"> </a>

<h3>Deductibles</h3>

<p>
A deductible is the amount of risk that you are willing to assume in case of a loss.  The higher your deductible, the lower your insurance premium.  Boat deductibles are usually determined as a percentage of your coverage and can range from 1% to 10%, depending on the type and speed of the boat.  For example, if your deductible is 1% of $20,000 of coverage, you would pay the first $200 of the loss.  When selecting the deductible on your policy, consider how much financial loss you are willing to assume.  Also consider how much premium you could save by choosing a higher deductible amount.  A lower deductible of $100 may be available for special equipment such as boat trailers, personal effects and dinghies.

<p>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="boatliability"> </a>

<h3>Boat Liability</h3>

<p>
This important coverage protects you if you are legally responsible for damages to property or injury to someone other than yourself or a family member.  Boat Liability coverage protects you in the event you are sued as a result of hitting another boat, or if someone is hurt onboard your vessel because of your negligence.  This coverage is usually offered in increments of $100,000 up to $1 million.

<p>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="additional"> </a>

<h3>Additional Coverages</h3>

<p>
The following additional coverages may be offered as part of your basic boat policy:
<ul>
<li><b>Uninsured Boat Coverage</b>: pays for injuries caused by an accident that you are entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured boat.  This also applies in situations involving an unidentified "hit-and-run" boat.

<li><b>Medical Payments</b>: covers reasonable medical, ambulance and hospital costs should someone be injured while in, upon, boarding or leaving your boat.

<li><b>Commercial Towing and Assistance</b>: you are reimbursed for the reasonable costs incurred when you break down at sea and need a commercial tow to port.

<li><b>Agreed Value on Outdrives (lower limits)</b>: provides replacement of lower drive units (without deduction for depreciation) if damaged or destroyed by a covered peril.
</ul>

<p>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="optional"> </a>

<h3>Optional, Low-Cost Coverages</h3>

<p>
The following separate coverages can complete your protection:
<ul>
<li>Optional Fishing Equipment: fishing tackle and equipment are not covered in the basic boat policy.  You may want to specifically cover this property if you have some expensive rods, reels or tackle.

<li>Increase the Limits offered for Personal Property, Uninsured Boater Coverage and Commercial Towing.
</ul>

<p>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="inspection"> </a>

<h3>Inspection Surveys</h3>

<p>I know this usually is Ken's Safe&Secure job, but I really need to take a few moments to discuss safe boating and measures that should be taken to prevent boating disasters.  Inspection surveys are strongly encouraged to prevent injuries and maintain the safest of boating conditions.

<p>This is especially important for older boats powered by gasoline because gas vapors can be extremely dangerous.  As boats get old, fuel lines on connections can wear out causing gas vapors to escape and settle at the bottom of contained areas.  Any spark can set off an explosion.  Please don't become a statistic.  Consider installing a vapor detector in your engine compartment.  Much like smoke detectors in your home, these low-cost devices can warn you of gasoline vapors in the engine compartment.  Also, take the time to inspect your boat on a regular basis, especially your electrical and fuel systems, and your safety equipment (such as fire extinguishers and personal flotation devices).

<p>We offer a free self-inspection brochure called Captain's Inspection:  A Stem to Stern Inspection Program for Boat Owners.  This handy booklet provides a checklist of the many areas that need to be periodically reviewed (like the hull, electrical and fuel systems, engine, ventilation, galley, and much more!).

<h3>Premium Savings</h3>

<p>Some companies demonstrate their commitment to safe boating by offering a premium credit for policies where all the operators have successfully completed a Power Squadron or Coast Guard Auxiliary basic or advanced seamanship course.  Copies of certificates are required.  Newer boats also benefit from lower premium rates.  Paula, our cost-conscious, frugal shopper has put together a section on the Ways to Reduce your Boat and Yacht Insurance Costs.  It's quite informative.  Check it out!  Also, your local, independent agent can help you determine which savings are available.

Insurance of any type can be a bit confusing and homeowners insurance is no exception.  I will try to help you understand the basics of homeowners insurance.

<P>When you buy homeowners insurance, you're buying protection for your property and your personal liability.  Please remember that there are several different types of homeowners policies offered by a wide variety of insurance companies and that not all coverages are the same or are available in all states.  You should speak directly with an independent agent about your specific coverage needs.  

<p>Keep in mind a few definitions as you begin.  Exclusions refer to situations where your policy does not provide coverage.  Liability refers to something that you are legally responsible for.

<P>Here's a list of topics generally associated with standard homeowners insurance. Click on any topic for more information.

ERGONOMICS UPDATE </H3> 
<P> 
While it could be years before an OSHA ergo rule is finalized, OSHA will spend much activity around its ergo efforts, given that it is a Clinton Administration priority. Repetitive stress injuries (sic) are the fastest growing workplace injury, with one in every three workers' comp dollars paid out for RSI claims. While OSHA's specific ergo strategy is unclear, the agency is drafting an action plan, which may be finalized in the next several weeks. Among other things, the agency plans to release a technical assistance manual of ergo data, publish a Federal Register request for info seeking ergo data and solutions, develop an ergo education video and hire a top-level ergo coordinator. In related developments, NIOSH has an "ambitious list" of approximately 26 ergo study projects identified for 1997. On the enforcement front, OSHA has been criticized for its lack of enforcement of ergo violations. However, an OSHA ergonomic enforcement steering committee is in the start-up phase, with a number of ergo citations in the works.

INDOOR AIR QUALITY: SECOND HAND SMOKE </H3>  
<P>
In its continuing efforts to get OSHA to address indoor air quality, the anti-smoking group ASH is encouraging the use and filing, under the general duty clause, of the anonymous OSHA complaint form. Since ASH lost a court battle last month to petition OSHA to promulgate a rule, the public interest group has been looking into other ways to push OSHA to move on indoor air tobacco smoke rulemaking. NACOSH also has levied criticism against OSHA for its delay in acting on a rule and plans to continue to press for action from OSHA.

METHYLENE CHLORIDE RULE TO BE PUBLISHED</H3>
<P>  
Despite the controversy over its risk assessment, OSHA soon plans to publish its proposed rule on methylene chloride, lowering the PEL from 500 ppm to 25 ppm. A recent economic analysis concluded that the rule is technically and economically feasible for all affected business groups. The economic impact is expected to be concentrated in furniture stripping, construction, and flexible polyurethane foam manufacturing. There is some speculation that the rule could be the first vetoed under the new Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Act, although OSHA says the rule has been drafted to reduce the impact on small businesses. The Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance opposes lowering the PEL to 25 ppm. Rather, the Alliance supports a PEL of 50 ppm, as recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists.

OSHA'S 1997 REGULATORY AGENDA</H3>  
<P>
OSHA has released its Semi-Annual Regulatory Agenda and a separate regulatory plan, detailing action planned for the agency's ten highly visible rulemakings considered agency priorities. The centerpiece is said to be OSHA's Safety & Health (S&H) Program rule which would require employers to implement comprehensive S&H programs. The agency also has targeted for review its lockout/tagout and ethylene oxide rules to determine their impact on small business. OSHA's ergonomics rule is slated under its "proposed rule" section of the agenda, with no schedule date for rule publication. Likewise, indoor air appears as a "long term action" with no scheduled date for rule release. The ten "Regulatory Plan" rulemakings expected to get the most attention are: metalworking fluids; steel erection, ergonomics, comprehensive S&H programs; hexavalent chromium; tuberculosis; PELs; slips, trips, and falls; recordkeeping; and the streamlining of certain rules as part of the Reinventing Government effort. With some overlap, the unified Semi-Annual Agenda includes a total of 30 items for 1997 activity. (OSHA's Semi-Annual Agenda list will be available to Engineers from Lotus Notes by mid January.)

PEP TO BE EVALUATED FOR NATIONWIDE USE</H3>  
<P>
OSHA has completed its general industry Program Evaluation Profile (PEP) pilot in six area offices. The agency will now  evaluate the PEP, with hopes to expand its use nationwide in the first half of 1997. The PEP form allows compliance officers to grade an employer's safety and health efforts and also can be used to determine penalties: decreases for small employers and good faith efforts and increases for high severity violations.

REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AMONG WOMEN </H3> 
<P> 
The CDC is seeking comments on its proposed request for information to be used to study adverse reproductive health effects among working women. NIOSH is planning to undertake five studies on the potential reproductive health effects on women of chemical and physical agents in the workplace. The first study will involve reproductive disorders in female flight attendants who are alleged to be potentially exposed to ionizing radiation and disrupted circadian rhythms during certain flight patterns.

SAFETY & HEALTH (S&H)PROGRAM RULE</H3> 
<P>
At a recent stakeholder meeting for the general industry S&H Program rule, objections were made to exempting small employers from documentation. Rather, it was recommended that small employers be held to a different level of documentation. It was also agreed that more work was needed on the multi-employer worksites provision. At the end of the meeting, most felt OSHA had done a good job in formulating its draft. OSHA plans to have a proposed rule by the end of FY 1997.

STEEL ERECTION GROUP CONTINUES WORK</H3>  
<P>
OSHA has reenacted the charter for the Steel Erection Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee (SENRAC), to allow the Committee to receive further recommendations on the proposed revised steel erection standard, especially on the one outstanding issue- standards governing slippery metal deck surfaces. The Committee will be seeking information, data, studies, and views to assist on this issue. The Committee will have up to another two years to issue a final rule.

<P><H3>
TB RULE ON THE MOVE</H3>  
<P>
While a final TB standard is with the OMB for review and basically ready for publication, that review has now been extended with no deadline set for the review period. A six-member panel, comprised of representatives from OSHA, OMB and the SBA, and charged with making the rule small-business friendly, has made several recommendations around definitions, economic impact, alternatives, and potential overlapping standards. Industries commenting on the proposed standard include homeless shelters, HVAC contractors, hospices, nursing homes, home health care and emergency medical services. As the final draft now stands, it closely mirrors CDC's 1994 TB guideline recommendations, published in the October 28, 1994 Federal Register.

<P><H3>
TEEN WORKER DEATHS </H3>  
<P>
According to a 1995 BLS report, the number of occupational fatalities for young workers has increased steadily over the last three years, with a somewhat higher incident among retail. For the three year period reported, 720 teen workers were killed on the job, with more than 700 deaths among workers under the age of 20. Transportation and violent attacks were among the top causes of death. Most fatalities from transportation incidents involved a single vehicle, with more than half involving jackknifing or overturning. 109 deaths were from homicides which included firearms.

<P><H3>
WORKPLACE VIOLENCE- RESTAURANT INDUSTRY</H3> 
<P> 
OSHA has conceded to the restaurant industry's suggestion that they not be included in the workplace violence guidelines for night retail but rather have a set of guidelines more suited to the restaurant industry. According to OSHA, the restaurant association could have its own guidelines within the first half of 1997.

<p>It's no secret that children view the world differently from adults.  They don't have the skills necessary to analyze dangerous situations or the consequences of their actions.  It's our responsibility as adults and parents to teach them the right way to do things through constant discussion and reminders.  By creating good habits from the start, we may be able to prevent accidents from happening.  The following tips should be helpful and discussed often with your children:

<H3>Bus Safety Rules</H3>

<P>The Connecticut School Bus Drivers Alliance recommends these simple bus safety rules:

<P><B>For Students:</B>

<p>
<UL>
<LI>Arrive at your bus stop on time.
<LI>Wait for the bus in a safe place, away from the curb.
<LI>Enter the bus in an orderly manner and take your seat.
<LI>Listen to and follow all of your bus driver's instructions.
<LI>Remain seated while the bus is in motion.
<LI>Keep the aisle clear at all times.
<LI>Do not throw objects inside the bus or outside the window
<LI>Be sure to tie your shoes and pack all papers inside your bag before getting off the bus.
<LI>Do not stand or walk behind the bus since the driver cannot see you.
<LI>Meet your parents on the same side of the street that the bus lets you off.
<LI>If you must cross the street when boarding or leaving the bus, be sure to walk where you can see the driver (and therefore the driver can see you!).  Wait for the driver's signal for you to cross, making sure that you look both ways for cars.
</UL>

<P><B>For Motorists:</B>

<p>
<UL>
<LI>Know your state's school bus laws and obey them.  Generally, flashing yellow lights mean caution, the bus is about to stop.  Flashing red lights mean stop, children are getting on or off.
<LI>When red lights are flashing, all traffic (in both directions) must stop.
<LI>Failure to obey school bus laws carries hefty fines that vary from state to state.  In Connecticut, for example, fines of up to $500 are assessed for the first offense.  Second offenses carry fines of up to $1,000 and 30 days in jail.  Also, convicted drivers face cancellation of their current auto insurance policies and find it extremely difficult to get future coverage.
</UL>

<H3>Safe Biking</H3>

<P>Every day at least one child dies in a bike-related accident, and another 1,000 are seriously injured.  Contrary to popular belief, most of these injuries are caused by simple falls due to road conditions and not from car collisions.  Many of these injuries can be avoided if cyclists just use proper equipment for protection, follow the rules of the road and remember to treat their bicycles with respect.

<P>Here are some simple rules you should review with your children:

<p>
<UL>
<LI>Bikes are vehicles, not toys.  Treat them as such.
<LI>Always wear your helmet.  A properly fitted bicycle helmet can reduce your child's risk of serious head injury by 85%.  In many states, wearing a helmet while riding a bike is the law!
<LI>Wear reflectors on your clothing after dusk.
<LI>Walk you bike across busy intersections.
<LI>Keep your bike in good shape, especially the brakes.
<LI>Follow the rules of the road just like all other vehicles.
<LI>Don't drive against traffic...drive on the same side of the road and the same direction as cars.
<LI>Obey all stop signs and traffic lights.
<LI>Don't ride more than one person to a bike.
<LI>Don't ride at night when drivers can't see you.
<LI>Don't ride in the street unless you know the rules.
</UL>

<h3>Auto Safety Tips:  Be Aware of Children</H3>

<P>Did you know that one out of four pedestrian-vehicle collisions involves a child under 15 years of age?  Most fatalities occur among those between ages 5 and 9.  They may be told, but still don't understand the threat of vehicles to their safety.

<P>AAA recommends that you keep the following safety tips in mind.

<p>
<UL>
<LI>Follow all traffic signs and symbols
<LI>Drive slowly near schools, playgrounds and residential areas
<LI>Watch for signs that children are in the area, such as buses, bikes, safety patrols and crossing guards.
<LI>Stop and leave adequate space between your vehicle and a stopped school bus regardless of the direction in which you are traveling.
<LI>Watch for students rushing to catch their bus.
<LI>Use extra care when the weather is inclement or when the sun impairs your vision.
</UL>

<p>Would you continually run your car without periodic check-ups?  Of course not.  The safety risks are too high.  Also, you might be able to catch small problems before they become big and expensive repairs.  Unless you know a lot about cars, it makes sense to bring your vehicle to a professional mechanic.  The same reasoning applies to yachts but with one important difference:  You can't walk away from your boat if it breaks down at sea!  Hence, where your car may periodically need maintenance service, your yacht needs annual maintenance and may occasionally need a Marine Survey.

<p>The following tips provide all you need to know about Marine Surveys:

<h3>Why Are Surveys Necessary?</h3>

<p>Professionally conducted Marine Surveys offer you many benefits.  Inspections go a long way toward protecting your investment, not to mention the safety and well-being of you, your passengers and fellow yachtsmen.

<p>A survey is a bit like swallowing medicine:  you don't look forward to it, but you feel better afterwards.  Like a doctor, a trained surveyor can identify conditions or potential problems which, if not corrected, could spell disaster.  Surveyors also occasionally find damage you were not aware of and which may be covered by your insurance policy.

<p>Surveyors look beyond glossy finishes to make sure your yacht meets time-tested safety standards.  These are established by one or more of the following nationally recognized boating safety organizations:  United States Coast Guard (USCG), National Fire Protection Association  (NFPA), Offshore Racing Council (ORC), and the American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC).

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="types"></a>
<h3>Types of Surveys</h3>

<p>Yacht surveys come in four basic flavors, each of which is used for a different purpose:

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Condition and Value Survey</b>:  Often referred to as a "C&V," this survey is the most comprehensive and expensive.  It usually includes evaluating or testing all the systems that keep a yacht afloat.  Surveyors conduct inspections on the hull, as well as all the mechanical and electrical systems.  This inspection includes an inventory of the type of equipment and an evaluation of its condition.  It also includes an assessment of the vessel's overall maintenance.  C&V surveys may involve sea trials, as well as hauling the yacht out for a bottom inspection.

<p>Miscellaneous tests may also be performed such as oil analysis, moisture meter testing, sounding for blisters, ultrasonic testing, galvanic corrosion testing, stray current and electrical tests.  Although this all sounds very high tech, these tests are relatively simple.  One uses a special meter to check for voids or blisters in the gel coat where moisture may have penetrated the core.  "Corrosion testing" may be nothing more than eyeballing for rust (signaling a potential problem).

<p>
<li><b>Buyer's Survey</b>:  When a yacht is purchased or refinanced, banks or lending institutions often require this type of survey to verify the condition, equipment inventory and value for financing purposes.  In many ways, this is similar to the inspection completed when buying or financing a home.  Depending upon the size and value of the yacht, these surveys can be as comprehensive as a full C&V, and may include sea trials.

<p>
<li><b>Insurance Survey</b>:  This is usually an abbreviated version of a C&V, which, as the name implies, is requested by the insurance company to verify a vessel's insurable value and condition.  These surveys usually do not include sea trials and may be performed while your yacht is in the water.  However, the preference is to do the survey when the yacht is out of the water so the bottom can also be inspected.  Most insurance companies require that a marine survey be conducted on yachts every five years.

<p>
<li> <b>Damage Survey</b>:  This is the type you hope you'll never need.  It is the post mortem usually performed by insurance companies to pinpoint the nature, cause and extent of damage associated with a claim.  They are used to identify items that require repair or replacement, and provide an estimate on the cost of those repairs.
</ul>

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="perform"></a>
<h3>Who Should Perform Your Survey?</h3>

<p>A survey is only as good as the person performing it.  One key to a surveyor's qualifications can be his or her membership in a nationally-recognized marine surveyor organization like the National Association of Marine Surveyors (NAMS), the Society of Accredited Marine Surveyors (SAMS) and the United States Surveyors Association (USSA).  These organizations require members to meet strict professional, technical and ethical standards.

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="cost"></a>
<h3>How Much Will It Cost?</h3>

<p>Cost is another important factor in selecting a surveyor.  Depending on the type of survey, your yacht's location, and even the time of year, a qualified surveyor can charge anywhere from $5 to $25 per foot, or up to $500 per day.  However, a higher price does not necessarily mean a better survey.  It always pays to shop around.

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="happens"></a>
<h3>What Happens During An Inspection?</h3>

<p>All surveys should start with a letter or phone call from the surveyor requesting permission to board your yacht and discussing any special preparation you'll need.  These may include the need to hire a captain if the survey will involve trials, or the haul-out of your yacht.  You should prepare your yacht for the survey by making sure everything is ship shape, with gear stowed and papers in order.  Also it's a good idea to accompany the surveyor during the process.  The surveyor will point out specific items that must be fixed, and why.

<p>Mast and rigging are the most difficult items to inspect when surveying a sailboat.  Although different methods may be used, surveyors usually limit their inspection to a visual check from the deck.  The brave-hearted may even climb aloft.  In either case, surveyors look for cracks, compressions, stretching, dents or corrosion.  Areas where problems are frequently detected are joints, stays, fastenings, bonding or welds.

<p>Below deck, surveyors focus on the:

<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Engine</b>:  A visual inspection is usually performed on all fuel lines, hoses, connections, clamps, filters, fuel tanks, exhaust, condition of the bilge, and, most important, the adequacy of ventilation.  Recommendations can range from simply cleaning oil spills in the bilge area to replacing fuel lines with marine-approved material.

<p><li> <b>Electrical systems</b>:  Here again, a visual inspection is generally performed to make sure there are no loose or frayed wires, that batteries are secured and vented in protective compartments to prevent sparks, that the vessel is properly bonded and grounded to minimize static electricity or lightning damage, and wires, outlets and circuit breakers are all approved for marine use.

<p><li> <b>Safety equipment</b>:  From ship-to-shore radios to rubber rafts, all equipment is inspected for compliance with U.S. Coast Guard regulations.  This includes operational navigational lights, capacity labels, flares and emergency equipment, survival gear, flotation devices and fire extinguishers.
</ul>

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="results"></a>
<h3>The Results</h3>

<p>Don't be surprised if the surveyor points out a few items that need correction or change.  Like everything else, parts wear out or may need a recharge.  Also, safety standards may have changed, especially if your yacht is several years old.

<p>There are two basic types of survey recommendations.  Essential (or critical) recommendations require immediate correction.  Desirable (non-essential) recommendations are usually cosmetic in nature.  While most tend to involve maintenance-related items, it's important the surveyor clearly indicates which actions require immediate attention.  For example, a frozen seacock may sound harmless and easily serviceable, but left unrepaired, could prove disastrous at sea.  Similarly, recommendations to replace hoses or install double clamps on through hull fittings, recertify fire extinguishers or replace frayed wires should never be taken lightly.

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="maintenance"></a>
<h3>Maintenance Should Be Ongoing</h3>

<p>Between surveys, the most effective way to keep your yacht seaworthy is a regular maintenance schedule performed by qualified personnel who can help keep little problems from becoming bigger ones.

<p>Call the U.S. Coast Guard's toll-free hotline (800-368-5647) and ask for their free booklet 
on Federal Requirements for Recreational Boats or a copy of their Courtesy Marine Examination 
or visit their <A HREF="http://www.dot.gov/dotinfo/uscg/welcome.html">Web site</A> to 
learn more about the Coast Guard's programs and services.

Ah, the good life.  There's nothing quite like the thrill of sailing.  A cool breeze, the smell of the sea, the sun shining above you and a beautiful craft below.  For an avid yachtsperson, there are few things that can compare.  However, for all the rewards, the pleasure of sailing does not come without its price.  It takes hard work, planning and a devotion to detail to stay on the right course.  You never know when an ill-wind might come along and cast you asunder.  That's why you take steps to protect yourself and your investment -- you pay attention to storm warnings, you read the currents, and most of all, you carry Yacht Insurance.

<a name="qualify"></a>

<h3>What Qualifies as a Yacht?</h3>

<p>
If your vessel is over 26 feet, it's considered a yacht for insurance purposes. Most cruisers, sailboats and sportfishing vessels fall under this heading. If your vessel is under 26 feet, it probably qualifies for Boat Insurance. Check out our <a href="./boat101.html">Boat Insurance 101</a> course if you'd like to learn more about this important coverage.

<p>
There are two major coverages that Yacht Insurance policies (like the Travelers Commodore Yacht program) provide:  Hull Coverage protection for your property and Protection & Indemnity liability protection.

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="hull"></a>

<h3>Hull Coverage</h3>

<p>
This important coverage pays to repair your yacht if it's accidentally damaged or destroyed by a covered peril (such as fire, theft, windstorm, lightning or vandalism).  Hull coverage is very broad, with a few exclusions such as wear and tear, dishonest, illegal, intentional or fraudulent acts.

<p>
Your policy should include coverage for machinery, outboard motors, spars and sails, equipment, apparel and furniture.  Equipment generally includes both permanently attached items (such as ship to shore radios, Loran systems and similar electronic and navigational gear) as well as auxiliary equipment such as deck chairs, binoculars, lifejackets and similar items normally used to operate or maintain your yacht.  Your dinghy and trailer can also be covered (to do so, this equipment must be scheduled -- or listed -- on your policy).  However, many companies automatically cover dinghies that are under 16 feet and 25 h.p.

<p>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="agreed"></a>

<h3>Agreed Value</h3>

<p>
Yachts are typically insured on an agreed value basis.  This means the company will pay you the full amount for which your yacht is insured in the event of a total loss.  The agreed value is the amount that is stated on the policy.

<p>
Like cars, a yacht's market value decreases over time.  For this reason, the most you are allowed to insure your yacht for is its fair market value.  In most cases, companies re-evaluate the market value of insured yachts every three years.  Therefore, the agreed value listed on your policy will more closely reflect the current market value of your yacht as it ages.

<p align=left>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="deductibles"></a>

<h3>Deductibles</h3>

<p>
A deductible is the amount of risk that you are willing to assume in case of a loss.  The higher your deductible, the lower your insurance premium.  Deductibles are usually determined as a percentage of your hull coverage and can range from 1% to 10%.  For example, if your deductible is 1% of $100,000 of coverage, you would pay the first $1,000 of the loss.  When selecting the deductible on your policy, consider how much financial loss you are willing to assume.  Also consider how much premium you could save by choosing a higher deductible amount.

<p align=left>
<A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="lower"></a>

<h3>Lower Deductibles Available For Special Property</h3>

<p>
Some companies offer lower deductible amounts on certain types of property, such as your dinghy (if under 16 feet and 25 h.p.), electronic equipment and personal property.  For example, let's say your policy deductible is $2,000.  If your $3,000 dinghy is stolen, you'd only receive $1,000 to replace it because of the high deductible.  However, with a policy from Travelers, your deductible for the dinghy is only $100, meaning that you'd receive $2,900 toward the replacement of this equipment!  That's a big difference in your wallet!

<p>
If your yacht is currently insured with another company, you might want to call your agent and check to see if a similar, lower deductible is offered under your policy.

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="protection"></a>

<h3>Protection and Indemnity (P&I)</h3>

<p>
This primary coverage is similar to the Liability protection you receive as part of your Homeowners coverage.  P&I protects you if you are legally responsible for damages to property or injury to someone other than yourself or a family member.  P&I can protect you in the event you are sued as a result of hitting another yacht, or if someone is hurt onboard your vessel because of your negligence.  This coverage is written only in conjunction with Hull Coverage and is not subject to a deductible.  It's usually offered in increments of $100,000 up to $1 million or more.

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="jones"></a>

<h3>Jones Act Coverage</h3>

<p>
If you employ a captain or crew member, make sure your P&I includes Jones Act Coverage.  This is a maritime form of worker's compensation coverage which will protect you if one of your employed crew members is injured on your yacht.

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="additional"></a>

<h3>Additional Coverages</h3>

<p>
The following additional coverages are offered as part of your basic Yacht policy:

<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li> Uninsured Boat Coverage:  pays for injuries caused by an accident that you are entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured boat.  This also applies in situations involving an unidentified "hit-and-run" boat.

<p>
<li> Medical Payments:  covers up to $1,000 for reasonable medical, ambulance and hospital costs should someone be injured while in, upon, boarding or leaving your yacht.

<p>
<li> Commercial Towing and Assistance:  You are reimbursed for the reasonable costs incurred when you break down at sea and need a commercial tow to port.
</ul>

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="optional"></a>

<h3>Optional, Low-Cost Coverages</h3>

<p>
The following separate coverages can complete your protection:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Hurricane Protection endorsement:  shares the costs you incur (up to $500) if you:

<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li>haul your yacht out of the water because the National Weather Service has issued a hurricane watch or warning for your moorage location.  (The resulting costs to relaunch your vessel once the watch or warning has ended are also included.) 

<li>hire a qualified, unrelated individual to navigate your yacht to safe harbor as a result of a hurricane watch or warning.
</ul>

<p>
<li>Optional Fishing Equipment:  Since most companies do not include fishing tackle as auxiliary equipment, you may want to specifically cover this property if you have some expensive rods, reels or tackle.
<p>
<li>Increase the Limits offered for Personal Property, Uninsured Boater Coverage and Commercial Towing.
</ul>

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="warranties"></a>

<h3>Warranties or Limits</h3>

<p>
Some restrictions may apply to your policy.  Here are some examples:
<ul>
<p>
<li><b>Pleasure Use Warranty</b>:  Most yacht policies require that your yacht be used for pleasure and recreational boating activities only.  Coverage for any business use, such as chartering, must be added to your policy (specifying bareboat or captained charter operation) and usually involves an additional cost.  Using a yacht to entertain business clients is generally considered to be "pleasure use," provided no money changes hands.

<p>
<li><b>Navigational Warranty</b>:  Most policies restrict the operation of your vessel to defined navigational territories or specific geographic areas.  Some examples:  New England waters, Great Lakes, inland lakes and rivers, or the Atlantic or Pacific coastwise waters.

<p>
<li><b>Lay-up Warranty</b>:  Some policies are written with a lay-up period in areas where the boating season is limited.  For a lower premium, yachts must be "laid up and out of commission" for specific dates on land or in the water, in accordance with the customs of local boat yards.  Lay-up means a yacht cannot be used for any boating activities during this period.  This warranty makes great sense in Northern climates where boating is hazardous during the winter months.  You "winterize" between December 1 and April 1 (time that you wouldn't be sailing anyway!).  This way, you don't have to pay for coverage you don't need.  A lay-up warranty does not prohibit having work done provided the vessel remains in its lay-up location.
<p>
<li><b>Seaworthiness Warranty</b>:  Most yacht policies provide an all-risk type of coverage, intended to cover loss or damage resulting from an accidental or fortuitous situation, excluding any loss for wear and tear or gradual deterioration.  This type of warranty states that the yacht must be maintained in a safe and seaworthy condition in order for insurance to be offered.
</ul>

<a name="marine"></a>

<h3>Marine Surveys</h3>

<p>
Prudent yacht owners should periodically have their crafts surveyed by a qualified marine surveyor.  Although there are some costs involved, these inspections go a long way toward protecting your investment (resulting in potential long-term savings), as well as ensuring the safety and well-being of those aboard and around your yacht.

<p>
Surveys can identify conditions or potential problems which, if not corrected, could spell disaster.  Surveyors also occasionally find damage you were not aware of, and which may be covered by your insurance policy!

<p>
Most insurance companies require that a marine inspection survey be conducted on yachts every five years.  Ken's Safe & Secure site offers extremely valuable <a href="../safe/marinetips.html">tips on Marine Surveys</a>, including information on the type of surveys needed, who should perform them, how much surveys cost and more.  Check it out!

<p><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="premium"></a>

<h3>Premium Savings are Available</h3>

<p>
Some companies demonstrate their commitment to safe boating by offering a premium credit for policies where all the operators have successfully completed a Power Squadron or Coast Guard Auxiliary basic or advanced seamanship course.  Copies of certificates are required.  Newer boats also benefit from lower premium rates.  Paula, our cost-conscious, frugal shopper has put together a section on the Ways to Reduce your Boat and Yacht Insurance Costs.  It's quite informative.  Check it out!  Your local, independent agent can help you determine whether these savings are available.

<p>The answers to all of these questions have a very direct impact on your auto insurance rates. Because auto insurance is such individualized coverage, you should speak directly with an independent agent about your specific needs.<br><br>Just to give you a basic understanding, I am going to provide you with brief descriptions of the different automobile coverages you can purchase to protect yourself and your vehicles. Please remember that these are brief explanations only and that any possible conditions, exclusions, limitations and extent of benefits that might pertain to your specific situation are not explained. Again, I encourage you to review your present policy and speak directly with an independent agent if you have any questions.

<A NAME="liability"></A>
<P>
<H3>Liability</H3>
<P>
Liability covers damages for accidental property damage or bodily injury caused by you or any 
member of your household who is specifically listed on your policy while driving a car covered 
by the policy.  This coverage applies only if the driver is legally responsible for the damage.
The <A HREF="./excess.html">Excess Liability Insurance 101</A> section can help you determine 
whether the liability limits on your automobile policy are sufficient for your needs.  Of 
course, an independent agent is a great resource for this evaluation.

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><br><hr><br>

<A NAME="medpay"></A>

<H3>Medical Payments</H3>

<P>This portion of your policy provides payments for all reasonable medical and dental expenses incurred by you or a member of your household as a result of an accident in your car, regardless of whose fault the accident was.  This coverage also covers passengers who may be riding in your car.

<P>There are situations when you would not be covered for medical payments.  One is if the injuries were sustained while your car was being used as a taxi or other commercial use.  Another would be if the vehicle you were injured in was a car owned by you, but not listed on the policy.

<P>Please refer to your automobile contract for the specific terms and conditions of the coverage that you have purchased.

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><br><hr><br>

<A NAME="um/uim"></A>

<H3>Uninsured Motorist/Underinsured Motorist</H3>

<P>Uninsured motorist coverage will protect you and your passengers in the event you or a member of your household is injured by someone who is found legally responsible for an accident but has either no insurance or coverage below the minimum required by law.  This coverage also protects you and the members of your household from injuries caused by a hit-and-run driver.

<P>Underinsured motorist coverage will protect you in the event you or a member of your household is injured by someone who is found legally responsible for an accident and has coverage, but not enough to cover your injuries and your coverage limits are higher than those of the at fault driver.

<P>Coverage is not identical in all states since each state has its own uninsured motorist laws.  In most states this coverage applies to bodily injury only.  However, property damage coverage is available in some states.

<P>There are situations when you would not be protected from uninsured motorists.  Coverage does not apply if you are injured in a vehicle owned by you, but not listed on your policy.  Second, coverage does not apply if you accept a settlement or begin legal proceedings against the person who caused the accident without the written consent of your insurance company.

<P>Please refer to your automobile contract for the specific terms and conditions of the coverage that you have purchased.

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><br><hr><br>

<A NAME="physdam"></A>

<H3>Damage to Your Auto</H3>

<P>There are two types of coverage:  (a)  Collision; (b)  Other Than Collision (also called "comprehensive coverage")

<p>(a) Collision coverage will pay for any damage to a car listed on your policy resulting from a collision with another automobile or object.  The maximum amount to be paid is limited to the actual cash value of your vehicle, commonly referred to as "blue book" value, less the collision deductible.

<P>(b) Comprehensive coverage will pay for most any damage to a car listed on the policy resulting from a situation other than a collision with another automobile or object.  Some of the things covered by this portion of your policy include: breakage of glass, falling objects, fire, theft, windstorm, hail, water, flood, malicious mischief, vandalism, or collision with a bird or animal.

<P>The maximum amount paid is limited to either a specified amount or the actual cash value of your vehicle less the "other than collision" deductible.  Comprehensive also covers damage to items stored in the car for up to a certain limit specified in your policy.

<P>Both of these coverages are usually subject to a deductible that is the amount you have to pay out of your own pocket for each claim.  The higher the deductible you select, the lower your premium payments will be.

<P>There are situations when your policy would not pay for damages.  For example, damage due to normal wear and tear such as mechanical or electrical breakdowns and flat tires, would not be covered.

<P>Please refer to your automobile contract for the specific terms and conditions of the coverage that you have purchased.

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><br><hr><br>

<A NAME="towing"></A>

<H3>Towing and Labor</H3>

<P>This coverage pays for towing and labor costs each time your car is disabled.  Any labor must be performed at the place where your car is disabled. <P>You may be able to purchase this coverage at various levels and it usually has a limit that will be applied to each loss.  

<P>Please refer to your automobile contract for the specific terms and conditions of the coverage that you have purchased.   

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><br><hr><br>

<A NAME="rental"></A>

<H3>Rental Reimbursement</H3>

<P>Rental Reimbursement coverage pays for a rental car if your car is damaged by something covered by comprehensive or collision coverage and if your car is out of commission for more than 24 hours.

<P>This coverage usually has a limit that will be applied to each loss.

<P>Please refer to your automobile contract for the specific terms and conditions of the coverage that you have purchased.

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><br><hr><br>

<A NAME="tapes"></A>

<H3>Tapes, Records, CD Coverage</H3>

<P>These items are not covered under your basic policy.  You can purchase this coverage that pays up to a certain limit for loss of your tapes/CDs  used with your car's stereo equipment, as long as they are in your car at the time of loss.

<P>Please refer to your automobile contract for the specific terms and conditions of the coverage that you have purchased.

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><br><hr><br>

<A NAME="cbradio"></A>

<H3>CB Radio/Car Phone</H3>

<P>These items are not covered under your basic policy unless installed by the manufacturer.  
You can purchase this coverage that will pay for loss to your CB or two-way radio/telephone if 
the equipment is permanently installed in your car at the time of loss.

<P>Please refer to your automobile contract for the specific terms and conditions of the 
coverage that you have purchased.   

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><br><hr><br>

<A NAME="custom"></A>

<H3>Custom Equipment</H3>

<P>Custom equipment for pickup trucks and vans is not covered under the basic policy.  You can purchase this coverage that provides physical damage coverage for custom equipment of your pickup or van.  

<P>Please refer to your automobile contract for the specific terms and conditions of the coverage that you have purchased.   

<P><A HREF="#index">[return to list]</A>

<br><br><hr><br>

<A NAME="trip"></A>

<H3>Travel Insurance</H3>

<P>This coverage pays expenses for car rental, commercial transportation, auto retrieval, meals and lodging, reservation deposit forfeiture and towing arising out of a loss to your auto occurring 100 or more miles from your home.  Except for towing, the "loss" to your auto must be covered by comprehensive or collision coverage.

<P>Please refer to your automobile contract for the specific terms and conditions of the coverage that you have purchased.

<STRONG><i>HELPING TO SOLVE MYSTERIES!</i></STRONG><BR>
It's 1:00 A.M. on a Sunday morning. A tall figure opens the door to a building. Another figure
stands by. A robbery? No. It's one of our dedicated lab technicians meeting one of our employer 
customers. The employer was delivering air samples that needed immediate analysis and evaluation. 
The previous day, workers had complained of "feeling sick" and the customer did not want to reopen
for business until there was reassurance that the work environment was healthy and safe. The analysis
was completed within 24 hours... doors opened Monday morning at 6:00 A.M., without disruption to
employees. Company operations continued without any loss in productivity.

<P>

<STRONG><i>EVERY DAY, EMPLOYEES SOMEWHERE MAY BE EXPOSED TO POTENTIALLY HARMFUL ON-THE-JOB SUBSTANCES</i></STRONG><BR>
New hazards continue to emerge, especially as new technologies evolve. This places
an important responsibility on you to keep current with workplace health requirements, such as "permissible exposure limits" and "medical monitoring" to ensure worker health. Need help?

<b><i>PROPERTY DISASTERS HAPPEN... Even to companies who least expect them</i></b> 
<P>
<B><i>1990- Happy Land Social Club fire - New York</i></B> - One of the deadliest fires in recent history, 87 people die - property damage in the millions. 
<P>
<B><i>1991- Imperial Foods Processing Plant fire- North Carolina</i></B> - One of the deadliest fires in an industrial workplace in recent history- employees fatally trapped- property damage in the millions.

<B><i>1993- World Trade Center- explosion and fire- New York</i></B> - a city is paralyzed- many are injured - property damage in the millions.
<P>
Over 165,000 fires occur in businesses each year, resulting in well over $2 billion in loss to structures, equipment, raw materials, and finished goods, to say nothing of the loss to life. If you own, manage or lease property, you also know that property disasters could mean the cost of business interruption, lost production and possibly lost customers and markets.
<P>
<b><i>"BE PREPARED" is not just a Scout Motto... IT IS A CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR</i></b><br>
Fire/ life safety protection is as important as your marketing strategies. Both are investments in your
future. Our fire protection engineering specialists can survey your existing property and operations and recommend property controls to reduce your loss exposures. Some of our services include:
<UL>
<LI>Property risk assessment, hazard analysis, and written evaluations
<LI>Property loss control recommendations, including program development
<LI>Property valuations to determine insurable values 
<LI>Insurance diagrams
<LI>Disaster preparedness evaluation and contingency planning

<b><i>PROTECTING THEIR JOB-HEALTH... IS A SOUND ASSET-BASED INVESTMENT</i></b><br>
If your employees complain of headaches, itchy eyes, terrible odors... even if you think nothing's wrong... <STRONG>LISTEN</STRONG>. These could be signs of exposure of a specific toxic contaminant or of general poor air quality due to poor air ventilation and circulation. 

<P>

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has concluded that 53% of all sick building
syndrome-related complaints are the specific result of an inadequate or contaminated HVAC system. <A href="#airqual">Poor indoor air quality </A> <A NAME="return1"></A> is generally a minor problem. Depending on the <A href="#symptoms">symptoms</A> <A NAME="return2"></A>, minor adjustments to your ventilation and air circulation may resolve the problem. Or, in the extreme, you could, find yourself
contacting your state or local health department because of building-related Legionnaire's disease or histoplasmosis due to bacteria or fungi. 

<p>

<b><i>YOU ARE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT TO MANAGE WORKER HEALTH... and We Can help.</i></b><BR>

<H3>What are some of the causes of poor air quality?</H3>

<DL>

<DT><B>Indoor Air Pollutants:</B>
<DD>Asbestos from insulation and fire-retarding building supplies; formaldahyde from
pressed wood products, carpeting, and other finishing materials; air fresheners; paints,
adhesives; copying machines; fumigants, and bioaerosols.

<DT><B>Outdoor Sources:</B>
<DD>Pollen, dust, microbial aerosols, industrial pollutants, and vehicle exhaust.

<DT><B>Building Ventilation Systems:</B>
<DD>Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in
sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor air and by not carrying indoor
air pollutants outside.

<DT><B>Use of Buildings in Unanticipated Ways:</B> 
<DD>A building intended for one purpose is converted for another use. If not properly
modified during renovations, the ventilation systems can contribute to poor air quality.

</DL>

<P>

<H3>What are some health effects of poor air quality?</h3>

<DL>

<DT><b>Indoor Air Pollution (IAP):</b> 
<DD>Generally considered to be when an irritant is present, and perhaps concentrated, in 
the building. Inadequate ventilation and circulation rates prevent removal or dilution of 
these annoyances.

<DT><b>Sick Building Syndrome (SBS):</b> 
<DD>Generally characterized by non-specific respiratory complaints, such as a cold or 
flu. Usually results from and inadequate outdoor air supply and/or heating, ventilation, 
and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.

<DT><b>Building-Related Illnesses (BRI):</b> 
<DD>Clinically diagnosed illnesses caused by specific microorganisms, with Legionnaire's 
Disease and Pontiac Fever the most recognized examples.

</DL>

<A NAME="symptoms"></A>

<H2>Specific symptoms suggest loss control actions you can take</H2>

<DL>

<DT><b>Thermal Discomfort</b>

<DD><b>Suggestion:</b> Check HVAC condition and measure temperature and humidity. Also check for 
drafts and stagnant areas.

<DT><b>Headache, lethargy, nausea, drowsiness, dizziness</b>

<DD><b>Suggestion:</b> In onset was acute, arrange for medical evaluation, because carbon monoxide 
poisoning my be the problem.

<DT><b>Congestion, swelling, itching or irritation of eyes, nose, or throat; dry 
throat or nonspecific symptoms.</b>

<DD><b>Suggestion:</b> May be allergy if small number of people affected. If many people are 
affected, look for sources of irritating chemicals, bio contamination, dirty HVAC system.

<DT><b>Cough, shortness of breath; fever; chills, and/or fatigue</b>

<DD><b>Suggestion:</b> Check for gross microbial contamination due to sanitation problems, water 
damage, or contaminated HVAC system.

<DT><b>Diagnosed Infection</b>

<DD><b>Suggestion:</b> May be Legionnaire's Disease or histoplasmosis, related to bacteria or 
fungi. Contact the state or local health department.

<H3>Antique Toy Insurance</H3>

<P>Bob and Betty Franklin are avid toy collectors, so much so that
they've taken out an Antique Toy insurance policy with the Reeves
&amp; Melvin Agency to safeguard their entire collection. Recently,
the Franklins attended a local Toy Show. Much to their surprise
and pleasure, they discovered a very rare mechanical bank in excellent
condition. Not wanting to pass on this fabulous find, the Franklins
purchased the bank for a fair price of $18,000. A while later,
while still at the fair, Bob and Betty met a couple of friends
who share their love of collecting. In their excitement to show
their new treasure, <b>Bob accidentally dropped the bank!</b> The original
moving mechanism was broken and the original paint was seriously
chipped.

<P>Bob and Betty are heartbroken. <a href="#answer19">Did breaking the bank break their bank? Or, in other words...is the loss to the toy bank covered?</a>

<H3>Antique American Folk Art Insurance</H3>

<P>George and Milly Eastbrook have a lovely home in the Indianapolis
suburbs. They have two cars, three children, a dog, a cat and
a beautiful display of (insured) fish and duck decoys in the den.
One afternoon while their youngest son Andy had a playdate with
his friend, the two boys ran into George's den. Normally the den
is off-limits when Dad's not home. But in this case, the boys
were playing hide-and-seek with older sister Beth, and the den
was just too good a hiding place to avoid. Beth would never think
to look there.

<P>Unfortunately, <b>Andy wasn't too familiar with his darkened surroundings
and ran right into a table holding, among other things, George's
$50,000 duck decoy</b>. The decoy went flying and the head and neck
broke off.

<H3>Glassware and Ceramic Antiques and Collectibles 
Insurance</H3>

<P>Tiffany Jones is an avid collector of Depression-Era Glassware.
She also collects china, porcelain and other unique collector's
items. The collection is beautifully displayed in her antique
bowfront china closet in the dining room. Tiffany is especially
proud of her cut-glass punch bowl which belonged to her grandmother.
This special bowl is on display on her sideboard.

<P>Tiffany has a housekeeper who routinely comes in to help her clean
and dust all of these items. While cleaning, <b>the housekeeper accidentally
dropped the rare punch bowl</b>...it shattered into millions of pieces.

<P>According to a recent valuation, the bowl had a value of $2,500.
Tiffany has a Homeowners policy, but never got around to purchasing
supplemental coverage for her collection. 

<p><A HREF="#answer21">How much will she receive for her loss?</a>

<p><A NAME="example15"></A>

<H3>Example: Boat Insurance</H3>

<p>Leslie and Mike McWilliams own a small, seven-year old motorboat that they enjoy using 
in Chesapeake Bay.  One weekend they accidentally "drove" over a submerged object.  
Apparently, the motor got tangled in the lines of a lobster pot causing <b>burned out bearings 
in their outboard motor</b>.  It will cost the McWilliams $500 to repair the motor.

<p><A HREF="#answer15">Is the outboard motor covered by their Boat insurance?</A>

<p><A NAME="example16"></a>

<H3>Example: Yacht Insurance</H3>

<p>Margie and Jonathan Morgan own a Sea Ray Express Cruiser that is docked in Newport, 
Rhode Island.  During a recent thunderstorm <b>their yacht was hit by lightning</b>.  The 
lightning destroyed all of the yacht's electrical equipment:  the depth finder, ship to 
shore radio and radar system were literally "fried."  The Morgans suffered a total loss 
of $3,000.

<p><A HREF="#answer16">Is any of this covered?</A>

<br><br><hr><br>

<p><A NAME="example17"></a>

<H3>Example: Porcelain Collection Insurance</H3>

<p>Susan and Richard Kendall live in a suburban town in Tennessee.  Susan is an avid 
collector of Enesco&#174; porcelain figurines.  In fact, she has quite an extensive 
collection, all displayed beautifully in a special glass cabinet in their living room.

<p>One day Richard was playing catch with their dog, Cleo...inside the house.  
Cleo missed a toss and <b>the tennis ball landed in the glass cabinet</b>.  The resulting 
damage to five of Susan's Enesco&#174; pieces landed Richard in the doghouse!

<p>According to a recent Greenbook, the value of the five broken figurines was about 
$1,000.  The Kendalls have Homeowners insurance but did not purchase supplemental coverage 
for the collection.    

<p><A HREF="#answer17">How much coverage did the Kendalls have against their loss?</A>

<H3>Example: Kaleidoscopes Up In Smoke</H3>

<p>John Sousa has always been handy.  He's been building things since he can remember.  
His wife Chris is an artist, and together they make incredible kaleidoscopes (Chris does 
the designs, John builds them).  After a while, as demand for their work continued to rise, 
they decided to quit their "day jobs" and concentrate on their kaleidoscope business.  To 
keep expenses low, they work out of their home.

<p>To conduct business as professionally as possible, the Sousas operate an office (a 
bedroom devoted exclusively to the business) that is filled with assorted business 
equipment and files.  Half of their garage is used to store various types of colored 
glass, lead solder (which holds the glass pieces together), exotic wood (like teak and 
walnut), and extra inventory.  John uses part of the basement to build and construct his 
elaborate works.  This area is filled with tools and necessary equipment.

<p>Unfortunately tragedy struck the Sousas four months ago when a <b>fire gutted their home</b>.  
Luckily, no one was injured.  Even luckier, the Sousa's agent had convinced them to purchase

<H3>Example: Excess Liability Insurance</H3>

<p>Jennifer Reed is 17 years old. She had been driving for one year with a spotless record 
until...she hit the car in front of her while checking out a cute guy across the street. 
Jennifer was clearly at fault. The operator and passenger in the other vehicle, the Wilsons, 
sustained serious neck and back injuries. <b>They sued Jennifer's parents</b>, Mark and 
Janet Reed for $750,000 (this figure included the cost of medical care as well as pain and 
suffering). The Wilsons won.

<H3>Flood Insurance</H3>

<p>Laurie and James Mitchell own a single family home in a suburb of Tallahassee, Florida.  
They do not have a basement.  It's been a very hot and dry summer -- the sun has literally 
been baking the earth for months.  When heavy rains from the aftermath of Hurricane Luis 
appeared, <B>the water had no place to go</B>...except into the Mitchell's home.  There was 
about 10" of water inside the home, causing damage to the walls, floors, doors, cabinets, 
appliances and contents.  The Mitchell's lawn furniture even floated away.  Luckily, their 
bank required them to purchase Flood Insurance as a condition of their mortgage.

<H3>Flooding</H3>

<p>As a result of the heavy rains that inundated the Mississippi valley in 1993, massive 
<b>flooding</b> occurred in Chesterfield, Missouri.  Hundreds of homes and businesses were 
flooded.  The overflow of the river from too much rain in a very short period of time 
flooded the Gordons' basement and part of the first floor.  The Gordon family's house is 
located quite a distance from the river and they believed that they were far enough away 
that their house would never be in danger.  They also felt their homeowners insurance offered them 
complete protection.

<h3>Answer: Antique Toy Insurance Example</h3>

<P>The Franklins are in luck! Since they already have Antique Toy
Insurance with Reeves &amp; Melvin in place, their loss is covered
for two reasons. First, the policy automatically insures additional
pieces for up to 30 days from the date of acquisition. This unique
feature allowed coverage to begin the moment the Franklins purchased
their bank. Second, the Antique Toy policy offers all-risk coverage,
<B>including breakage</B>. This is coverage that simply is not
available under a Homeowners policy.

<P>The Franklins were able to receive $18,000 (the full value!) for
the loss. Luckily, in this case, breaking the bank did not bankrupt
the Franklins!

<h3>Answer: Antique American Folk Art Insurance Example</h3>

<P>If you said yes, you're right. You may have noticed that the Eastbrooks
had insured their decoy collection, in this case under an Antique
American Folk Art insurance program. This insurance covers all
sort of risks, including breakage (a peril not covered by their
Homeowners policy). Therefore, after a $1,000 breakage deductible
is applied, the Eastbrooks will receive $49,000 to replace their
&quot;dead&quot; duck.

<P>Had the Eastbrooks not taken steps to insure their antique decoys,
they probably would have suffered a complete loss.

<h3>Answer: Glassware and Ceramic Antiques and Collectibles Insurance
Example</h3>

<P>Zip! Unfortunately, Tiffany's Homeowner policy <B>does not cover
breakage loss</B>. Homeowners coverage is determined by the <I>way</I>
property is damaged. Had the punch bowl been destroyed as a result
of a named peril (a hazard specifically listed in the policy,
such as fire or theft) its replacement would be guaranteed. Since
the damage was caused by accidental breakage, Tiffany will have
to absorb the entire loss.

<P>If Tiffany had purchased the Glassware and Ceramic Antiques and
Collectibles policy, she would have received a check for $2,250
(a 10% breakage deductible of $250 would have applied).

<h3>Answer: Boat Insurance</h3>

<p>Yes, the McWilliams' outboard motor is covered under their Boat insurance policy, but this equipment is only covered on an actual cash value basis.   That means that the insurance company will pay the market value cost of the outboard motor minus depreciation.  The actual cash value of the outboard motor is $400.  Because the McWilliams have a $100 deductible on their policy, the insurance company will give them $300 towards the repair.

<h3>Answer:  Yacht Insurance</h3>

<p>Yacht insurance covers this loss on a "new for old" basis.  The Morgans can repair or replace most of their damaged goods with brand new electrical equipment (with no deduction for depreciation).  Therefore, minus the Morgan's $1,000 deductible, the insurer paid $2,000.</p>

<h3>Answer: Porcelain Collection Insurance</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, the Kendall's Homeowners policy <b>does not cover breakage losses</b>. Homeowners coverage is determined by the <b><em>way</em></b> the property is damaged. Had Susan's figurines been destroyed as a result of a <a href="./home101.html"><b>named peril</b></a> (a hazard specifically listed in the policy like fire or theft) their replacement would be guaranteed.  Unfortunately, since damage caused by an errant tennis ball is not considered a named peril under the Homeowners policy, the Kendalls had to absorb the entire $1,000 loss.

<p>Had the Kendalls purchased a Porcelain Collection policy with a 10% breakage deductible, they would have received a check for $900.

<h3>Answer: Kaleidoscopes Up In Smoke</h3>

<p>The Sousas were extremely fortunate (under the circumstances)... because they had purchased Home Business Coverage as add-on protection to their Homeowners policy. The Sousas also had sufficient amounts of coverage to be able to replace their home and its contents (both personal and business-related items). The Homeowners insurance paid:

<ul>
<li> to repair all structural damage to the home

<li> to repair or replace damaged personal possessions (furniture, appliances, clothing, etc.)

<li> for the family's living expenses until the structural damage was repaired and the house was safe to occupy.
</ul>

<p>The Home Business Endorsement portion of the Homeowners policy paid:

<ul>
<li> to repair or replace the business equipment in the Sousa's office as well as the construction equipment in their basement

<li> for lost income until the Sousa's could get their business back on track (it took about two months until they could set up temporary shop in a local building)

<li> for extra expenses incurred to rent out work space so they could continue their business

<li> to replace lost inventory and raw materials that were destroyed in the garage.
</ul>

<p>The Sousas are in the process of simultaneously rebuilding their home as well as their business.  It hasn't been easy; a lot of special possessions have been lost.  However, the Sousas are grateful to their agent for suggesting that they take extra steps to safeguard their business.  For although it will take time to rebuild, at least they can.

<A NAME="answer1"></A>

<H3>Answer:  Flood Insurance</H3>

<P>
The Mitchells were very fortunate to have Flood Insurance, since <em>none</em> of this flood damage would have been covered under their Homeowners policy.  And because the flood coverage required by the mortgage company was a least 80% of the replacement cost of their home, the Mitchells qualified for replacement cost coverage on the actual structure.  That means that the cost to repair or replace the building was covered (less the minimum $500 deductible).  Wall-to-wall carpeting was replaced, floors were dried and refinished, the walls were painted, cabinets and appliances were replaced.

<P>
Although the mortgage company did not require flood coverage for the <b>contents</b> of their home, the Mitchells purchased contents coverage based on their agent's recommendation.  Therefore, the Mitchells received actual cash value for their damaged contents, again less the $500 deductible.  The insurance adjuster reviewed each item that was damaged/destroyed and assessed a value minus depreciation.  The lawn furniture, unfortunately, was not covered.

<br><br><hr><br>

<A NAME="answer2"></A>

<H3>Answer: Dentures</H3>

<P>In this case, Dena's dented dentures are not covered under <b> her </b> Homeowners policy.  Here's why:  although dentures are considered personal property, coverage is determined by the <em> way </em> the dentures are damaged.  For example, had Dena's dentures been damaged as a result of a <b> named peril </b> (a hazard specifically listed in the policy like fire or theft) their repair or replacement would be guaranteed.  Unfortunately, little Joey's carpentry enhancements are not considered a named peril under the Homeowners policy.

<P>There is, however, another course of action that Dena can pursue, if she wants.  It's possible that little Joey's parents have their own Homeowners policy.  Since their child caused the damage, their Homeowner's liability protection would probably cover this damage.  Dena's agent, or Joey's parents' agent can provide more information as to whether this would be a viable alternative.

<A NAME="answer3"></A>

<H3>Answer: Company Car</H3>

<P>Elizabeth's personal auto insurance policy will not pay for the damage to the pole or to the company car.  At the time of the accident, she was driving a car -- the company car -- that was furnished and available for her regular use.  The company car is not covered by her personal auto policy, but she may be covered under her company's auto insurance policy.

<A NAME="answer4"></A>

<H3>Answer:  Kitchen Fire</H3>

<P>The Smiths' homeowners insurance policy will pay to:

<p>
<UL>
<LI>clean up the smoke and soot damage throughout the house; 
<LI>repair the structural damage to the kitchen (including paint and wallpaper replacement);
<LI>repair or replace damaged appliances (whichever costs less); and,
<LI>pay for the family's living expenses until the structural damage is repaired and the house is safe to occupy.

<A NAME="answer5"></A>

<H3>Answer: Flooding</H3>

<P>No.  Homeowners insurance policies exclude flood as a covered peril.  A separate flood insurance policy must be purchased for protection against floods.  Since the town was declared a federal disaster area because of the overall devastation, the Gordons had the option to apply for federal disaster assistance.  Had Chesterfield not been declared a federal disaster area (most flooding events do <b>not</b> qualify), there would have been no assistance available.  The Gordons were not eligible for a grant (maximum $12,600) because they were both gainfully employed.  They did, however, qualify for a federal loan ... essentially a second mortgage.  What the Gordons discovered too late was that the <b>annual</b> premium for a flood insurance policy could have been less than the <b>monthly</b> payment for the loan.

<A NAME="answer6"></A>

<H3>Answer: Valuable Items</H3>

<P>Most homeowners policies, even with the addition of contents replacement cost coverage, have a dollar limit for the theft of certain items, silverware being one of them.  The limit in the Cromwells' policy was $1,000.  Had they purchased an optional "valuable items" policy, they would have received the $3,000 it will take to replace the set.

<p><a href="#index">[ return to list ]</a>

<br><br><hr><br>

<A NAME="answer7"></A>

<H3>Answer:  Excess Liability Insurance</H3>

<P>Yes, luckily the Reeds are fully covered because they had a purchased a million dollar Excess Liability policy when Jennifer started driving.  First, the Reed's auto insurance carrier paid $300,000 (the full amount of liability coverage that was on their policy).  Their Excess Liability policy paid the remaining $450,000 as well as associated legal defense and court costs.  Without Excess Liability insurance, the Reeds would have had to pay the $450,000 out of their own pocket.

<P>Of course, not every parent needs to purchase an Excess Liability policy the day their teenager starts to drive!  It all depends on how much the family has to lose.  A call to your local independent agent can help you determine whether this coverage is necessary.

<b><I>IMMEDIATE INJURY INTERVENTION ... COMPASSION AND CARE... <br>All are Key to Your Workers' Compensation Loss Cost Experience</i></b><br>
When injured workers don't understand what to expect after a workplace injury and don't get the help or answers they need from their company management, they may feel the need to turn to an attorney for help. When they do, this can have an adverse affect on your workers' compensation loss experience.
<P>
<b><i>YOU ARE IN A POSITION TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE</i></b><br>
Many companies say that a post-injury management program, where injured employees are treated like partners... with respect, compassion, and care... can result in a significant decrease in attorney involvement and workers' compensation costs. It also boosts employee morale and productivity. 
<P>
<b><i>INTEGRATED INJURY MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS... <br>We can help to get you there</i></b><br>

We can work with you to help you customize post injury management options to fit your specific business operations and company policies and programs. Our customized program services include:

<LI>System support through a helpline network
<LI>Design and implementation of transitional duty and other return-to-work programs
<LI>Development of a medical provider network, with a "sports medicine" philosophy
</UL>
<P>
<b><i>RETURN TO WORK PROGRAMS... FROM GROUND ZERO... TO FINE-TUNING</i></b><br>
Our injury management consultants also can help enhance an existing return to work program or work with you to design one from ground zero.
<p>
<b><i>MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORKS: FORGING QUALITY ALLIANCES</i></b><br>
Quality of medical care can greatly influence medical outcomes. Our injury management
consultants can evaluate the level of care available through existing providers, identify those providers who incorporate a "sports medicine" philosophy in treating work-related injuries, and provide an action plan to

The Leading Cause of Job-Related Deaths...<br><br><ul>Happens Behind The Wheel!</ul>

<p><br><br>

<b><i>WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD: TRANSPORTATION ACCIDENTS</i></b><br>
Highway and industrial site<STRONG> transportation-related accidents</STRONG> are the #1 cause of job-related deaths in the United States. Whether you operate trailers coast-to-coast, utilize passenger cars locally, or operate a forklift at your jobsite, a well designed loss control program for your fleet of vehicles (trucks, buses, passenger cars, forklifts) is smart business. It may help decrease the potential for vehicular accidents and the direct and indirect costs associated with injuries and property damage.

<P>

<b><i>WHERE CLEAR IDENTIFICATION AND RAPID REPSONSE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE</i></b><br>
Compliance with local, state, and federal laws around the <STRONG>transport of hazardous materials ("HAZMAT")</STRONG> could also be a major concern for you. Do your employees know what to do if what they are transporting is considered a hazardous material and there is a spill? HAZMAT transportation compliance includes, among other things: 
<UL>

<br>
<p>A quick review of the following tips should help you keep your holidays full of laughter and joy:

<br clear=all>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Examine New Toys Carefully.  Toys that contain small parts pose a potential choking hazard and should be kept away from children under three years of age.  Make sure that toys are age appropriate so that children can use them properly (most companies list the toy's age range on the package).  Also, children should receive proper guidance for toys that require instruction or supervision, such as chemistry sets, riding toys, sports equipment and toys that use electricity.

<p>
<li> Protect Your Pets.  Keep all decorations away from your pet -- even small nibbles of mistletoe can cause digestive problems.  Also, glass ornaments can cause cuts if they break, so be sure to keep them out of your pet's reach.

<p>
<li> Natural Trees are beautiful, but can be deadly.  The following tips can help you reduce the fire risk caused by natural trees:

<p>
<ul>
<li> If your tree's trunk is already cut, saw it off at least another inch above the original cut before you set up the tree.  This new cut will allow your tree to soak up water, allowing your tree to stay fresher longer.

<p>
<li> Anchor your tree securely in an upright position in a stand sturdy enough to support the tree.  A Christmas tree can be easily knocked over, especially by children or pets.  If you have an oversized tree, small children or pets, you might want to consider attaching a support wire from the top of the tree to a hook on the wall.

<p>
<li> Provide plenty of water.  Root balls should be moistened daily.  Cut trees should be placed in containers with enough water for one day's supply (about one-gallon) and refilled daily.

<p>
<li> Keep natural trees indoors only as long as they are fresh.  A maximum of 10 days is recommended for cut trees.
</ul>

<p>
<li> Keep trees and decorations a safe distance away from heat sources, such as heaters, fireplaces, stoves and candles.

<p>
<li> When setting up electrical lights, please keep the following tips in mind:

<p>
<ul>
<li> All electrical lighting should be in good condition, tested and officially labeled for use as holiday decorations.

<p>
<li> Don't overtax electrical sockets by overwhelming them with too many plugs.

<p>
<li> Use caution when climbing on ladders to set up lights.  Make sure you have a "spotter" to hold and secure the equipment.  And, when you're setting up outside, take extra care to avoid power lines.
</ul>

<p>
<li> Turn off (or disconnect) lighting when the area is unattended or when you go to sleep.  Don't let children or pets play with or chew on Christmas-tree lights -- they could get electrocuted.

<p>
<li> Keep Hanukkah or Christmas Candles out of the reach of children.  Supervise children and pets around lit candles.  Also make sure that there are no surrounding cabinets or curtains that could catch fire.

<p>
<li> Don't Drink and Drive.  I know it's been said before...but there are so many alcohol-related accidents during this season, it needs to be repeated:  If you must drink, please assign a designated driver to take you home or call a taxicab.

<p>
<li> Enjoy Your Holidays!  Please accept the Travelers' very best wishes for a happy, healthy, safe and secure new year!
</ul>

<i><b>"KEEPING-UP" WITH THE MANY SAFETY RULES CAN BE CHALLENGING </b></i><br>
The field of loss control and safety management is an ever changing, ever dynamic field. Every 
year, federal OSHA, EPA, DOT, CPSC, USDA, FDA, among other regulating agencies, and standards
organizations, such as NFPA and ANSI, identify annual agenda of safety priorities they plan to 
work on. Many of these items can affect your workplace... your people, your products, and your property. 
Every day, every week something new happens in the area of workplace safety and health... a new issue emerges, an old standard is amended. And, every year, the mass of rules and regulations may cause a surge of 
compliance questions. Today's safety manager, indeed, is challenged. We know that keeping up with 
the latest safety and health issues and rules, and controlling your loss exposures is a large responsibility.
We can help.

<P>

<i><b>WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF "KEEPING-UP" AND IMPLEMENTING THE RIGHT PROGRAMS </b></i><br>
We monitor standard-making activity and developments of a number of agencies dedicated to workplace
safety and health. We watch new and emerging issues and trends that could affect your loss experience.
We keep our network of safety and health specialists informed on safety issues and rule developments, including
rulemaking activity. We seek information and clarification, when appropriate, from state and federal 
regulating agencies and other safety organizations. Our safety specialists utilize new safety knowledge 
in the programs and services designed to meet your program needs. Our monitoring is available to you, too, and includes: 
<UL>

This two-page brief objectively abstracts a number of "hot" and new developments each month which have the potential to affect your workplace loss experience and loss management programs.

<LI><b>A quarterly</b>, <A  href="../topics/engp17.html">Loss Control Topics &amp; Challenges,</A> which covers a range of hot topics and issues, including practical guidance and free resources for safety and health guidance on a range of subjects.  

<LI><b>Compliance consultation</b>, as part of our other safety services.

<P><br>
<i><b>KNOWING YOUR LOSSES IS LIKE THE OLD ADAGE: KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE... KEEP YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER</i></b><br>
When it comes to loss management, there is some applied wisdom in the old adage, "Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer." Losses and loss claims are like an enemy of your bottom line. Understanding your claims and losses... identifying patterns and trends... can help you design strategies to 
address your loss exposures and potential liabilities. This analysis and strategic action planning is part of the "continuous improvement" philosophy and mission of quality organizations.
<P>
<i><b>CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PLANNING RESTS ON GOOD DATA</i></b><br>
Good company data is important in understanding your risk exposures and your loss costs. The understanding derived from an analysis of your loss data, in turn, can be used to design safety and health programs for your workers, your processes, your products, your property... in order to better manage your loss potential and experience.
<P>
<i><b>"CARMA ON-LINE" IS AVAILABLE TO HELP YOU</i></b><br>

<b><i>THE SINGLE LARGEST CATEGORY OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION INJURY</i></b><br>
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that cumulative trauma disorder (CTD), also known as repetitive
motion strain, is the single largest injury category driving workers' compensation costs in the United States. 
CTD also results in the longest absences from work. Carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, and back strain are 
among a few "CTD" disorders. These disorders translate into people and business costs. In addition to the 
impact on the physical well-being of employees, long absences may result in lost productivity and increased
workers' comp claim costs... all impacting your bottom line.

When a job-task demands we use our body in a way that is not natural to its capabilities,
this can place "unnatural stresses" on body tissue, especially where the task is repetitive, prolonged,
and labor intensive. Demanding tasks are many, varied, and found virtually in every industry.
They also can result in injuries and disorders, including permanent disability.

<p>Homeowners insurance is great: it offers a tremendous amount of
protection and gives us peace of mind. In fact, we tend to take Homeowners
coverage for granted. We think if it's in our house, we're covered. Well,
it's not that simple. Some items have limits as to how much is covered.

<br clear=all>

<p>For example, most Homeowners policies only cover a <b><em>small</em></b>
amount of business property (usually up to $2,500). If you own and operate
a business out of your home, that's probably <b>not enough protection</b>! 
There are also a number of business exposures (like business liability and
loss of business income) that are not part of the basic Homeowners policy. 
You really need to consider some additional options.

<p><b>If you work out of your home but are employed by someone else</b>, you
might want to consider expanding your Homeowners coverage with a low-cost <a
href="#optional">Optional Higher Limits on Business Property
Endorsement</a>.

<p><b>If you own and operate a small business out of your home</b>, you

<h3>Optional Higher Limits on Business Property Endorsement</h3>

<p>If you work out of your home but are employed by someone else, you might
want to check with your employer to see if the business equipment you use at
home is insured by your company.  If not, you might want to consider
expanding your Homeowners coverage with Optional Higher Limits on Business
Property.  This add-on to your Homeowners policy lets you insure the
business property in your home, as well as up to $10,000 of coverage for
business property away from home.  For just pennies a day, you'll get
coverage for your business property, including portable cellular phones and
protection for damage to property belonging to others.  Your local insurance
agent can help you determine what's best for your needs.

<h3>The Travelers Home Business Endorsement:  An Introduction</h3>

<p>The Travelers Home Business Endorsement is add-on coverage to your Travelers
Homeowners policy that is designed to meet the needs of small business
owners who work out of their homes.  With this coverage you get additional
protection for your business -- protection that most business owners have to
acquire through more expensive commercial policies.  For example, an annual
premium of just $250 buys you $300,000 of liability protection for your
home-based business, property protection for your business equipment, loss
of income coverage and a whole lot more.  Keep reading for more details.

<p><a href="#index">[ return to list ]</a>

<a name="coverage"> </a>
<h3>Coverage for Business Property</h3>

<p>This Home Business add-on protection covers the business property in your
home, as well as up to $10,000 of coverage for business property away from
home.  With this coverage your computer, printer, fax machine, desk and
filing cabinets have the same protection as your television, turntable and
toaster!

<p><a href="#index">[ return to list ]</a>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="business"> </a>
<h3>Business Liability Protection</h3>

<p>Your <a href="./home101.html">Homeowners liability coverage</a> is
expanded to include general liability for your home-based business (up to
the limit of liability offered by your Homeowners policy).  In other words,
your Homeowners Liability definition will include product liability,
business-related personal injury and advertising liability.  Professional
Liability coverage is not provided under this endorsement.  If you think
that you need Professional Liability coverage, or just need to know what it
is, contact your local independent insurance agent.

<p><a href="#index">[ return to list ]</a>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="loss"> </a>
<h3>Loss of Business Income and Other Coverages</h3>

<p>You also receive coverage for:

<p>
<ul>
<li>loss of business income:  if you are unable to conduct your business
operations due to a covered loss to your home, your insurance will reimburse
you for lost income (for up to 12 months).

<p>
<li>extra expenses that are incurred after a home loss to get your business
back up and running.

<p>
<li>up to $2,500 for valuable papers and accounts receivable, if these
records are damaged or destroyed by a covered loss.
</ul>

<p><a href="#index">[ return to list ]</a>

<br><hr><br>

<a name="increased"> </a>
<h3>Increased Special Limits on Your Current Homeowners Coverage</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Other structures (such as detached buildings at your home address that
are used for the home business) are now included and covered up to the <a
href="./home101.html">Coverage B</a> limit offered under your Homeowners
policy.

<p>
<li>Up to $2,500 Coverage for stolen or destroyed:

<ul>
<li>money (personal and business)
<li>credit and ATM cards (personal and home business use)
<li>cellular phones while you're off-premises.
</ul>

<p>
<li> Damage to other people's proper
y while in your care (at your residence
and used for your home business) is covered up to $2,500.
</ul>

<h3>How to get the Home Business Endorsement</h3>

<p>The Travelers Home Business Endorsement is currently available in Connecticut,
Illinois, Maryland and Ohio (with expansion to other states being planned).
 If you'd like more information about this coverage or a quote, let us know
via <a href="../../mail/home.html">Let's Talk</a>.  Or you might want to
contact your local independent insurance agent.  Also, check out our <a
href="./examples.html">Real-Life Examples</a> if you'd like to see an
example illustrating how this add-on coverage works.

<h3>Other Sites for Home Business Owners to Review</h3>

<p>If you think you need even more coverage for your business or if you'd
just like to browse, I suggest you check out the Travelers Online <a
href="http://www.travelers.com/smallbiz/">Small Business insurance site</a> where
there's lots of useful information for your company.

<p>I've discovered another site on the Net that might be useful to people
who operate businesses out of their homes. The American Home Business
Association (AHBA) site shares up-to-date home business information and
provides access to a network of other similarly-based entrepreneurs. The
site also offers information on AHBA group benefits that may be worth
investigating. Click here to check out the <a
href="http://www.homebusiness.com/Home1/AHBAHome.html">AHBA Site</a>.

<p>Rough Notes magazine has been running a series of articles on insuring
your home business.  Although written for insurance agents, consumers should
be able to glean several  useful tidbits of information.

Just click on the "<B>Need Help</B>" button...<A HREF="/helpdesk/helpdesk-form.html"><IMG  SRC="/helpdesk/gif/buttons/NeedHelp.gif"></A><BR><P>

We will attempt to contact you during our <B>normal</B> hours of operation--with a phone call, if you provide us with a telephone #, or via email, if you provide us with an email address to write to.<P>  

<BR><P><BR><P>


<B><LI></B><IMG  SRC="/gif/icons/bulletinboard.gif">    We have created a <B>public <A HREF="news:potsdam.helpdesk">HELPDESK bulletin-board</A></B> where you can "post" a question, a technical problem or a request for more information (technically, our "bulletin-board" is a <A HREF="/Campus-Dictionary/Glossary/definitions.html#newsgroup">newsgroup</A>).

Click on the "<B>Helpdesk BB</B>" button to read, or post, messages...<A HREF="news:potsdam.helpdesk"><IMG  SRC="/helpdesk/gif/buttons/Helpdesk-BB.gif"></A><P>


We routinely check this area for requests, but anyone else on our campus can too, and may very well have just the answer or information you are looking for.  In fact, our hope is that this area becomes an active space where the campus community shares its technical expertise. <P>

<FONT SIZE=5><B>What to do while at the HELPDESK (when you aren't serving someone):</B></FONT>
<OL>
<LI>Teach yourself about all of our services using the same tools/information that we ask our customers to use.  That is, navigate through our Web documentation (the "<A HREF="/isd/it_intro.html">IT_Intro</A>" page and the "<A HREF="/helpdesk/filecabinet.html">HELPDESK Filecabinet</A>").  <P>


<LI>Look for mistakes, inconsistencies, contradictions in what we say in different places, missing *vital* information and use the FEEDBACK forms to pass along what you find.  This is <B>very</B> important if we expect this information to work for us during the school year.<P>

Load the <A HREF="/helpdesk/HELPfilecabinet-feedback.html">feedback form for the HELPDESK filecabinet</A> now and leave it in a separate Netscape window so you can use it quickly as you find problems.  If you don't know how to create multiple Netscape windows,   please ask someone in the DCTM department how to right now!


<LI>Familiarize yourself with our full set of HELPDESK tools--Timbuktu, the telephone features, the "potsdam.helpdesk" newsgroup.  Check the bookmarks in NETSCAPE to be sure we have the right one readily available.  You should at least have bookmarks for:<P>

<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI> HELPDESK filecabinet
<LI> Dial-In Access Request Form 
<LI> Introduction To Information Technology at SUNY Potsdam
<LI> BearFacts (Potsdam's Homepage)
</UL><P>      


<LI>Create/revise our documentation--especially for those things we don't have good documentation on.  Use this time to add it to our HELPDESK base of information.  Use those HTML skills you've been avoiding.  There should be a folder of HTML development tools on the HELPDESK computer containing at least:
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI> Web Weaver
<LI> GIFconverter
<LI> cliptogif
</UL><P>
      
<LI>Make notes of what works and what doesn't; what's needed and what isn't.
   Send those comments using the appropriate <B>FEEDBACK form</B> or send email to them to Bob Jewett (<a href=mailto:jewettrj>jewettrj@potsdam.edu</A>).<P>


<LI>Monitor the "<A HREF="news:potsdam.helpdesk">potsdam.helpdesk</A>" news group (read it).  Call the <B>Network</B> HOTLINE (<B>x2884</B>) and <B>Activities</B> HOTLINE (x<B>4444</B>) and listen to the messages.<P>


<LI>Teach the staff and/or students you work with how to do everything above.  Coach them on how to deliver good customer service and to keep our <B><A HREF="/dctm/mission.html">Department mission</A></B> and <B><A HREF="/helpdesk/HELPDESKproj.html">HELPDESK mission</A></B> in mind.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Troubleshooting PC SLIP Dial-in Problems</H1>

<HR SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="Is_modem_dialing"></A><H2>Is the modem dialing?</H2>
Ask the user if they can hear anything from their modem when they ask it to dial?  That is, a dial tone or any hi-pitched tones as modem attempts to connect?  If there is <B>no sound</B>, the modem may have its sound turned off.  Turn the sound <B>ON</B> and listen again (may need to consult the modem manual to find the command to turn the sound ON).<P>

If the sound was ON but there was no sound from the modem as it attempted to dial, then the modem connection is not correct.  Check BAUD RATE and COM PORT settings (see below)<BR><P>

<HR SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="COM_port_and_Baud_rate"></A><H2>Are COM port and BAUD rate set correctly?</H2>
The two settings are the most common problems for users who cannot successfully dial into our campus network.<P>

<B>COM port</B> should be set to <B>1</B> or <B>2</B> (see modem manual for correct setting).  As a quick fix, if the user has entered COM port 1, have them try 2, and vice-versa.<BR><P>

<B>Baud rate should be 9600 or better.</B>  While 2400 baud works, it may fail as often as it succeeds in making a connection.  <B>1200 baud</B> does <B>NOT</B> work.<BR><P>

<HR SIZE =3><P>

<A NAME="login.cmd_script_needs_editing"></A><H2>Login.cmd Script needs editing:</H2>

If the COM port and baud rate are set correctly, the next most common problem is the time-out settings in the the <B>login.cmd script</B>.  To edit these, choose <B>EDIT Login.CMD</B> under the Dial-In menu item.  <P>
<A HREF="/HELPDESK/communications/dial_in/SLIP/SLIPscript-login.cmd.HTML"><FONT SIZE=4>Click here for complete instructions on <B>what</B> to edit and <B>how</B>.</FONT></A><BR><P>

<HR SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="Dial-in_account_correct"></A><H2>Does the user have a dial-in account and is it correct?</H2>

The user may not have applied for a dial-in account and will need one.  If they user does not have an account, use the <B>SLIP/PPP/ARA Dial-in Account request FORM</B> under "Bookmarks" in Netscape.<P>

If the user applied for an account, check to see if it is active and/or correct.  You will need to TELNET to the Shiva LanRover dial-in server.  <P>

<A HREF="telnet://137.143.108.209/"><FONT SIZE=5>TELNET to <B>Shiva LANRover</FONT></B></A>

<DL><DD>logon with the user's account name and password when you are prompted (<B>@userid:</B>).</DL>
<P>



If you are able to connect to the Shiva LanRover dial-in server, then
the problem with the user's connection is in their hardware (modem/computer).  The user may need to have their modem checked by the vendor they purchased it from, or they may need to bring their modem/computer into the office for Dave Brouwer [Email:  <a href=mailto:brouwedf@potsdam.edu>brouwedf</A>] to check.<P>

<P>
This document is designed to show you how to configure ARA (Appletalk Remote Access) dial-in software with SUNY Potsdam's remote access server.  On top of ARA you will need to install the SUNY Potsdam custom remote access software package to allow you to connect to SUNY Potsdam with TCP/IP services. (E-mail, WWW, NetNews, Gopher, etc....)  We have included extensive text and screen shot graphics to walk you through the install and customizing process of both packages so as to ensure that everything goes fine for you durring the install process.<P>

<p><TABLE CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=3 BORDER=1 width="100%">
<TD VALIGN=MIDDLE>The first thing you must do is check your Hard Drive and make sure there is not a folder labeled: "<CITE>Communications F.</CITE>". If there is a folder by this name at the root level of the Hard Drive this installation process will <B>OVERWRITE</B> that folder and everything in that folder will be lost.  You must first rename that folder on your Hard Drive.
<P>
Next you need to reboot (restart) your Macintosh with the extensions turned off (this is done with the shift key down at startup).  This will turn off any inits, extensions or virus protection software.  This makes sure that the software installs properly.

You have now completed the process for installing the ARA software customized for use with SUNY Potsdam's dial-in service.  The are only a couple things left to do before you can use your computer to dial-in.  The first is to launch the <b>AppleTalk Remote Access</b> application that was installed on your HD by the ARA install disks.  It is probably located in a folder called "AppleTalk Remote Access Client" at the root level of the HD.  After it is launched you will be presented with a window that will prompt you for the following information:
<P>
<P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT> <b>Name:</b>
<DD>      This is where you would place your e-mail name.  ex. smith12
<DT> <b>Password:</b>
<DD>      You will be told what your dial-in password will be when you setup your account with Distributed Computing.
<DT> <b>Save my Password (checkbox):</b>
<DD>							If this is checked it will remember your password so that you do not have to type in your remote access password from you computer evertime you connect.  But you do have to enter it the first time as mentioned above.
<DT> <b>Number:</b>
<DD>      The main phone number to dial in is (315) 267-3342.  Depending where you are calling from you can enter as much or as little as you want/need.  For example from campus you only need to enter 3342.  From in the town of Potsdam you must enter 267-3342.  From other long distance places you must enter (315) 267-3342.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Macintosh<br>PPP Dial-in Install Directions</H1>
<P>
This document is designed to show you how to configure PPP dial-in software with SUNY Potsdam's remote access server.  The SUNY Potsdam custom remote access software package allows you to connect to SUNY Potsdam with TCP/IP services. (E-mail, WWW, NetNews, Gopher, etc....)  We have included extensive text and screen shot graphics to walk you through the install and customizing process so as to ensure that everything goes fine for you durring the install process.<p>

This installer process is designed to allow Mac users who have MacOS 7.5.3 (with Open Transport 1.1 or higher already installed) or previous versions of the MacOS (using MacTCP 2.0.6 that gets installed by the installer) to be able to connect to SUNY Potsdam through a dial-up PPP session.  Please make sure to follow the directions carefully while installing and configuring.   And finally make sure that you install the correct settings based on the MacOS version you have installed.<p>

<HR WIDTH=325 SIZE=4 NOSHADE>
<HR WIDTH=225 SIZE=3 NOSHADE>
<OL>
<LI> The first thing you must do is check your Hard Drive and make sure there is not a folder labeled: "<CITE>SUNY Potsdam Dial-in (v2.0)</CITE>". If there is a folder by this name at the root level of the Hard Drive this installation process will <B>OVERWRITE</B> that folder and everything in that folder will be lost.  You must first rename that folder on your Hard Drive.<br><br>
<LI> Next you need to reboot (restart) your Macintosh with the extensions turned off (this is done with the shift key down at startup).  This will turn off any inits, extensions or virus protection software.  This makes sure that the software installs properly.<br><br>
<LI> Insert the install disk (if there are more then one disk then use install disk 1).<br><br>
<LI> Double click on the icon for the disk.<BR>
<CENTER><IMG VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="gifs/diskicon.GIF"></CENTER><br>
<LI> Double click on the program called <B>SUNY Potsdam PPP Install</B>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="gifs/finderwindow.GIF"></CENTER><br>
<LI> You should soon see (and read) a window with the latest changes and notices with regards to continuing this installation. Read it and press '<B>Continue</B>'.
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 HEIGHT=175 WIDTH=250 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="gifs/readme.GIF"></CENTER>


<br><br>

<LI>At this  point you must decide what type of installation you need to do.  If you are using MacTCP (systems software versions prior to 7.5.3) you should choose the first option which is MacTCP Full Install.  If you are using Open Transport (system software version 7.5.3) then you should select the second option, Open Transport Full Install.  From here, it should automatically install all of the various files needed in their correct places.  This includes resources and preferences in the System Folder and communication applications in the SUNY Potsdam Dial-in (v2.0) folder.<p>
Select the installer you want/need and click on the '<B>Install</B>' button.
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 ALIGN=BOTTOM  HEIGHT=175 WIDTH=250 SRC="gifs/selectinstall.GIF"></CENTER>
<LI> You should then be presented with a window telling you that you will have to restart your computer when you are done installing. Just click the '<B>Yes</B>' button.
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="gifs/NeedToRestartWin.GIF"></CENTER>

<LI> Next you will see a window showing the progress of the installation.  At various time your computer will eject the current disk and ask you to insert a different disk. Simply follow the on screen directions.
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="gifs/ProgressWin.GIF"></CENTER>
<LI> When the installation is complete you should be presented with a '<B>Installation Complete</B>' notice.  Once you have clicked on the '<B>restart</B>' button your computer will of course be restarted.
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="gifs/SuccessfullWin.GIF"></CENTER>
<p>
<p>
<LI> When your computer is all finished restarting, select '<B>Control Panels'</B> from under the apple menu.
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="gifs/ControlPanelsMenu.GIF"></CENTER><p>
<LI> Once the Control Panels window opens, double click on the '<B>ConfigPPP</B>' icon.
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="gifs/ConfigPPPIcon.GIF"></CENTER><pre>

<LI> You should then see the window called '<B>ConfigPPP</B>'.
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="gifs/ConfigPPPWin.GIF"></CENTER>
<LI> Choose type of phone connection you will be using from the PPP Server pop-up menu.
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="gifs/ConfigPPPWinPOPMenu.GIF"></CENTER><PRE>



</PRE>
<LI> Select the '<B>Config..</B>.' button to edit more settings; such as modem speed, type of phone line (tone/pulse) and modem initialization string.
<CENTER><IMG VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="gifs/PPPsetupscreen.GIF"></CENTER><BR>
<LI> Select the '<B>Authentication...</B>' button.  Then enter the username and password given to you by the Distributed Computing helpdesk staff.
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="gifs/LoginWin.GIF"></CENTER>
<LI> Once you have finished editing, press '<B>Okay</B>' to return to the settings window and then '<B>Done</B>' to return to the main ConfigPPP window.
<BR>
<LI> You are now ready to dial-in. Press the '<B>Open</B>' button to begin dialing.
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="gifs/ConfigPPPwin.GIF"></CENTER>
<LI> You should soon see a window showing the dialing status.
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG VSPACE=2 HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="gifs/PPPDialing.GIF"></CENTER><br>
<LI> If all goes well dialing, the status window should go through all of the steps of dialing-in and then return you to the '<B>ConfigPPP</B>' window.  It will then show <b>PPP Up</b> in the upper left corner of the window.  This means you are connect to the campus network.

<h1>Users Instructions For Internet Tools</h1>




<FONT SIZE=5>To use any of the <B>Internet Tools</B>, you need to do the following <BLINK>FIRST</BLINK>!!!</FONT><P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Start <B>TCPMan</B> by double clicking on the TCPMan Icon in the Internet Group.<P>

<LI>Click on the dialer menu and select <B>Login</B>.<P>

<LI>You should then see the following messages shown here with &gt &gt :<P>

<DD>&gt &gt <B>Initializing modem.</B><BR>
<DD>&gt &gt <B>Connecting to SLIP server.</B><BR>
<DD>&gt &gt <B>Connected to SLIP server.</B><BR>
</DL>
<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>NOTE:</FONT></B> <BR>
If the modem doesn't initialize or dial at all, then either the com port or baud rate are not correctly set (go back to step <A HREF="/HELPDESK/communications/dial_in/SLIP/SLIP_WIN_setup.html#Step 11">#11 of the directions for "To Setup the Internet Tools"</A>.
<P>

If the modem dials, but then the <B>script aborts</B>, then we have to adjust the parameters in the <A HREF="/HELPDESK/communications/dial_in/SLIP/SLIPscript-login.cmd.HTML">script file</A>.  The two common fixes are to change the modem time-out from 30 seconds to either 45 or 60 seconds, and to change the delay time after the modem dials.


<BR><P>


At this point you should be prompted for your username and your password--steps 4 and 5.  If you have problems, check the <A HREF="/helpdesk/communications/dial_in/slip/slip-flowchart.html"><B>SLIP troubleshooting flowchart</B></A>

<BR>

<P><HR><P>
<FONT SIZE=5><B>The Following is a description of the "Internet Tools":</B></FONT><P>

<B>TCPMan (Trumpet Winsock) </B>is used to make a TCP/IP connection via your modem and 
the telephone line 	to Potsdam College. This is only used for this purpose and must be started and it must 
create a connection 	before using FTP, Netscape, Gopher, or Eudora.<BR>
<P>
	<B>Netscape</B> is a World Wide Web Browser.  You can use it with gopher sites, ftp sites, read news 
groups and of 	course view web pages.  Web pages are documents that are linked to other documents and can 
support 	multimedia. Any word that is highlighted in a different color can be clicked on and it will take you to 
another 	page or another web site.<P>
<P>
	<B>Gopher</B> can only be used with gopher sites.  Gopher has a tree type structure in that you choose 
your path and 	continue to narrow your path until you arrive at the information you are looking for.  There are 
two basic 	entities in gopher a directory and a text file.  A directory will look like a folder and file looks like 
a sheet of 	paper.  In directories there are other directories and/or files. To view a file or change directories 
click on the 	folder picture or the paper picture next to the item you want.<P>
<P>
	<B>FTP</B> is a program used to download files from remote machines connected via the internet to your 
machine.  	There are a number of sites which offer freeware (no cost) and shareware (you pay if you want to 
keep it). <P>
<P>
<A NAME="Eudora for Windows">	<B>Eudora</B></A> is an E-mail program to receive pop mail from your account here at campus.  You can't use Eudora to retrieve mail from VAX accounts (e.g., SPOTVB).  This program allows you to type mail messages without 
being 	connected to the internet (saving you a large phone bill if you are calling into the campus from home) and you can then connect when you are ready to 
send 	the message(s).  You can also look-up on campus phone numbers and E-mail addresses of students, staff and 
	faculty by selecting <B>Finger</B> under the <B>Window</B> Menu in Eudora.<P>
<P>
<HR><P>

When you are finished using the Internet you need to do the following to close the connection otherwise you may 
incur an incredibly large phone bill <B>if</B> you are calling into the campus long-distance:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Close any Internet tool you were using, but don't close TCPMan without properly hanging-up using the <B>BYE</B> 
	command under the <B>Dialer</B> Menu in TCPMan!!! (<B>If you don't understand follow the rest of the 
instructions!</B>)<P>

<LI>At the bottom of your screen, <B>NOT</B> in the Program Manager, you should see an Icon for TCPMan 
(The Icon 	is here because you minimized it earlier and it has been running the whole time you used the 
Internet Tools).  	Double click on the TCPMan Icon .<P>

<LI>Once inside TCPMan's Window, Click on the <B>Dialer </B> Menu and select the <B>BYE</B> command and you should 	wait until your modem disconnects and you should see a script aborted message.  At this point you can <B>close TCPMan</B> by clicking on the <B>File</B> menu and selecting 
<B>Exit</B>.
<P>
<P>
<BLINK>NOTE:</BLINK><BR>
If you are worried about your modem still being connected you can exit Windows and <B>turn OFF the power to your machine</B>,  wait 30 seconds, then if you 
turn on the computer again you should be ok.  If you want further assurance and have a phone on the line pick up the phone and if you hear a dial tone 
your modem is disconnected.<P>

Also to prevent costly phone bills and to be fair to others who want to use SLIP, the SLIP connection will automatically disconnect after 1-hour of use.  At this point you can reconnect again for more 1-hour connections.

<CENTER><H2>Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy</H2></CENTER>
                         <H2 ALIGN=CENTER>SUNY Potsdam</H2><P>

In addition to providing library services, campus administration database management and institutional research, the <A HREF="/isd/ISDplan.html">Information Services Divison</A> supports computing, networking and information resources for the students,
faculty, staff and guests of SUNY Potsdam.  Computer
facilities and services are offered in support of teaching
and learning, research and public service.  Access to the
computer systems and networks owned and operated by SUNY
Potsdam imposes certain responsibilities upon users, in
accordance with College policy and local, state and federal
law.   Users accept the responsibility for utilizing
services in ways that are ethical, that demonstrate academic
integrity and respect for others who share this resource.
This policy is established in an effort to help users
understand what is expected of them.  It sets guidelines
regarding the issues of privacy and respect for property,
ownership of data, system security, and misuse of the
system.<P>


<H3><A NAME="Academic Integrity">Academic Integrity</A></H3>

Just as in any other aspect of a student's academic work,
SUNY Potsdam expects that students will use computing and
network resources in ways that are honest and ethical.
Actions that constitute academic dishonesty include:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>turning in someone else's work as your own
<LI>allowing someone to represent your work as his/her own
<LI>several people working on one paper and submitting it individually, as if each had done the paper alone
<LI>using another's work without proper acknowledgment
</UL><P>

<H3><A NAME="A Shared Resource">A Shared Resource</A></H3>

SUNY Potsdam computer and network services are available to
all faculty, staff and students.  Because there are so many
individuals who utilize this shared resource, respect for
the rights and needs of others is central to this policy.
To ensure access and service for all users, users must
refrain from any action which interferes with the system,
such as:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>using computer or network services for commercial purposes
<LI>excessive game playing which impairs the academic work of other students
<LI>sending excessive e-mail or messages locally or over the network such as chain letters, advertisements or solicitations
<LI>knowingly installing or running a program that will damage or place an undue burden on the system
<LI>knowingly acting in a manner that will disrupt normal operations of computers or the network
</UL><P>

<H3><A NAME="Privacy">Privacy</A></H3>

Technology should not be used in a manner that infringes
upon an individual's right to privacy.  The following
restrictions are imposed to protect your privacy, as well as
the privacy of others.  Users are prohibited from:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>using computer or network services in a way that violates copyrights, patent protections or license agreements
<LI>gaining unauthorized access to information that is private or protected, or attempting to do so
<LI>running programs that attempt to identify passwords or codes
<LI>interrupting programs that protect data or secure systems, or attempting to do so
<LI>monitoring or tampering with another person's e-mail
<LI>reading, copying, changing or deleting another person's work
<LI>using another person's password, or allowing others to use yours
<LI>attempting to gain network privileges to which you are not entitled
</UL><P>

<H3><A NAME="Respectful Exchange of Ideas and Information">Respectful Exchange of Ideas and Information</A></H3>

Computer systems and networks allow for a free exchange of
ideas and information.  This exchange serves to enhance
learning, teaching, critical thinking and research.  While
the constitutional right of free speech applies to
communication in all forms, we encourage civil and
respectful discourse.  College policy and local, state and
federal law do prohibit some forms of communication, to
include:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>obscenity
<LI>defamation
<LI>advocacy directed to incite or produce lawless action
<LI>threats of violence
<LI>disruption of the academic environment
<LI>harassment based on sex, race, disability or other protected status
<LI>anonymous or repeated messages designed to annoy, abuse or torment
</UL><P>

<H3><A NAME="Personal Responsibility">Personal Responsibility</A></H3>

Each individual who obtains a computer/e-mail account, or uses
the computers and network resources made available by SUNY Potsdam,
must understand that he/she is accountable for the policies set
forth in this document.  In addition, users assume responsibility
for:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>protection of his/her password
<LI>reporting any breech of system security
<LI>reporting unauthorized use of his/her account
<LI>changing his/her password on a regular basis
<LI>frequently making back-up copies of your work to ensure against loss
<LI>clearly label works and opinions as his/her own before they are widely distributed
</UL><P>

<H3><A NAME="Authority">Authority</A></H3>

The Information Services Division may access other's files for the maintenance of networks, computers and storage systems.  In all cases, individual's rights to privacy will be respected to the greatest degree possible.  Office staff may also routinely monitor and log usage data,
such as network connection times, CPU and disk utilization for each
user, security audit trails, and network loading.  Data
collected may be reviewed and further investigated should
evidence of violation of policy or law occur.  If necessary,
staff may monitor the activities and files of specific users
on their computers and networks.  Any staff member who
believes such monitoring is necessary should discuss the
problem and strategy for investigation with the appropriate Information Services Division Director.<P>

Any student who violates the policies set forth in this
document is subject to disciplinary action as defined in the
Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities and Conduct.
Faculty and staff who violate these policies are subject to
disciplinary action as defined in the Faculty Handbook.  All
violators may be subject to arrest according to local, state
and federal law.

<A NAME="Chain letters"></A><H2>"Chain letters":</H2>

Each year, along with the change of colors in the Fall and the blossoms in the Spring, there is an increase in the number of "chain letters" distributed over the Internet.  While the content of most of these letters is innocuous, the impact of distributing them is not and we need everyone's cooperation is "breaking" the chain (and <I>challenging</I> the credibility of the dire predictions for doing so).  <P>

Our campus typically distributes thousands of email messages every day and those messages compete for two very precious shared resources--network capacity to transmit them, and storage space to hold them until they are read and discarded.  Most chain letters typically ask you to forward them to a list of friends and frequently include a list of previous senders as well.  If you multiply this number by the number of users participating in distributing chain letters, you can imagine the impact this load has on our email system and our network.  <P>

Please help us discourage the distribution of <B>any</B> chain letter.  Your cooperation will go a long way toward maintaining the integrity and quality of our campus email service.  Distributing "chain-letters" is referred to in our <A HREF="AUP.html#A Shared Resource">Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy</A> and is cited as an example of an action that interferes with the use of our shared tehcnology resources.

<CENTER><H2>Electronic Mail (Email) Policy at SUNY Potsdam</H2></CENTER><P>
<B>Obtaining an Email Account:</B><P>

In order to use electronic mail at SUNY Potsdam it is necessary to have an
email "account" or usercode which is unique for each user.  This  prevents
anonymous mail and establishes the electronic address for each email user
to which electronic mail can be received from other email users on- or
off-campus.  Each email account is protected from unauthorized access, in
part, by requiring the use of a unique password to identify the legitimate
user.<P>

Any student, faculty or staff member of SUNY Potsdam, who provides proper
college identification, may request an email account.  While SUNY Potsdam
does not prohibit the use of email for personal reasons, users should
recognize that the primary intention of providing email service is to
support the educational mission of the college and the conduct of its daily business.<P>

<BR><P>

<B>Postmaster Responsibilities for Email:</B><P>

It may be necessary at times for the local SUNY Potsdam Electronic Mail Postmaster (<A HREF="http://www.employee.potsdam.edu/dctm/brouwedf/brouwer.html">David Brouwer</A> -- email:  <a href=mailto:postmaster@potsdam.edu>postmaster</A>) to read an electronic mail message which has failed to reach its destination in order to determine, if possible, the intended addressee and redirect the message to the correct address.  However, it is not otherwise the practice of the postmaster to read nor to discuss the content of any message.<P>

<BR><P>

<B>Privacy of Email:</B><P>

It is impossible to ensure the confidentiality of any electronic messages
stored or communicated through our computing facilities. As pointed out by
other universities, "The privacy of electronic mail is somewhere between
that of a letter and a postcard."  While confidentiality cannot be ensured, all email is considered private and confidential.  Except as noted under Postmaster Responsibilities for Email above, email is <B>not</B> to be read by SUNY Potsdam staff or any others with sufficient computer system privileges to do so.<P>

<BR><P>

<B>Hierarchy of Communication with Email:</B><P>

Email is intended to be a person-to-person form of electronic
communication.  It is addressed to a specific individual and does not
adhere to any chain of command in its delivery.  Anyone may write to
anyone.<P>

<BR><P>


<B>Ethics of Email:</B><P>

The "<A HREF="/isd/policies/AUP.html">SUNY Potsdam's Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy</A>" applies to email.<P>

<CENTER><H2>Printing Policy at SUNY Potsdam</H2></CENTER><P>
<H3>1996-97 Printing Policies</H3>



In August '96, the two laser printers were moved from the <A HREF="/dctm/cybertour-IT/crumb/levitt.html">Levitt Center</A> to the Library's Circulation Desk.  There were two reasons for this move:  (1) the Library was introducing full-text resources to include printing, and (2) to provide more accountability in the use of printing resources and reduce waste. <P>


In practice this means that Levitt Center users collect their print jobs at the Circulation Desk rather than in Levitt.  As part of the accountability issue, <A HREF="#Number of copies">printing of one copy of a paper</A> is free to SUNY Potsdam students, who must present their ID to collect their paper .  Non-students must purchase a print card ($3) at the Bookstore, currently, good for 20 copies.  Students are encouraged to use duplicating machines for multiple copies.<P>


Some positive aspects of this change are (1) there is always someone on duty at the Circulation Desk to monitor the printers, report problems, and add paper or toner as needed. (2) User's papers are not shuffled through, damaged, or discarded by other users while searching for their own print-outs.  (3) There is more privacy of an individual's work than was previously the case.<P>


The use of computers and printers has been at an all-time high this Fall ('96) semester. Students have to wait in line at times, both for computers, and for their papers to come through the print queue.  For example, in the week following Thanksgiving break, nearly 2,000 sheets of paper (4 reams) were used daily in the two printers at the Circulation Desk.  The bulk of those papers came from Levitt, though some were generated from the <A HREF="/dctm/cybertour-IT/kellas/kellas100b.html">Kellas classroom</A>, the <A HREF="/dctm/cybertour-IT/dunn/dunnSGA.html">SGA Lab</A> in Dunn, <A HREF="/dctm/cybertour-IT/flagg/flagg162.html">Flagg classroom</A>, or the <A HREF="/DCTM/cybertour-IT/cybertour-list.html#Residential computer centers">residence hall computer labs</A>.
<P>


Your Technology Fee supports this student computing and printing activity as well as other student technology resources.  Just to put some numbers to this:  Paper costs a little over $3/ream, and toner cartridges cost $88 each (cartridges are changed at about the rate of one/week).  We know this printing arrangement has significantly reduced waste of resources and improved control of distribution, when compared to last semester.  The goal is to optimize the use of Tech Fee funds in as responsible a manner as we can.<BR>

<A NAME="Number of copies"><B>How many copies can be printed?</B></A>
<P>
The current policy for printing is that students registered for coursework  at SUNY Potsdam may laserprint <B>one</B> copy of their work at no cost.  <B>Additional copies</B> may be printed by obtaining a <B>printing card</B> at the Barrington Union College Store.<P>

The general public may print to a laserprinter in a public facility <B>only</B> if they have a <B>printing card</B>.

<CENTER><H2>Printing Policy at SUNY Potsdam</H2></CENTER><P>
<H3>1996-97 Printing Policies</H3>



In August '96, the two laser printers were moved from the <A HREF="/dctm/cybertour-IT/crumb/levitt.html">Levitt Center</A> to the Library's Circulation Desk.  There were two reasons for this move:  (1) the Library was introducing full-text resources to include printing, and (2) to provide more accountability in the use of printing resources and reduce waste. <P>


In practice this means that Levitt Center users collect their print jobs at the Circulation Desk rather than in Levitt.  As part of the accountability issue, <A HREF="#Number of copies">printing of one copy of a paper</A> is free to SUNY Potsdam students, who must present their ID to collect their paper .  Non-students must purchase a print card ($3) at the Bookstore, currently, good for 20 copies.  Students are encouraged to use duplicating machines for multiple copies.<P>


Some positive aspects of this change are (1) there is always someone on duty at the Circulation Desk to monitor the printers, report problems, and add paper or toner as needed. (2) User's papers are not shuffled through, damaged, or discarded by other users while searching for their own print-outs.  (3) There is more privacy of an individual's work than was previously the case.<P>


The use of computers and printers has been at an all-time high this Fall ('96) semester. Students have to wait in line at times, both for computers, and for their papers to come through the print queue.  For example, in the week following Thanksgiving break, nearly 2,000 sheets of paper (4 reams) were used daily in the two printers at the Circulation Desk.  The bulk of those papers came from Levitt, though some were generated from the <A HREF="/dctm/cybertour-IT/kellas/kellas100b.html">Kellas classroom</A>, the <A HREF="/dctm/cybertour-IT/dunn/dunnSGA.html">SGA Lab</A> in Dunn, <A HREF="/dctm/cybertour-IT/flagg/flagg162.html">Flagg classroom</A>, or the <A HREF="/DCTM/cybertour-IT/cybertour-list.html#Residential computer centers">residence hall computer labs</A>.
<P>


Your Technology Fee supports this student computing and printing activity as well as other student technology resources.  Just to put some numbers to this:  Paper costs a little over $3/ream, and toner cartridges cost $88 each (cartridges are changed at about the rate of one/week).  We know this printing arrangement has significantly reduced waste of resources and improved control of distribution, when compared to last semester.  The goal is to optimize the use of Tech Fee funds in as responsible a manner as we can.<BR>

<P>
The current policy for printing is that students registered for coursework  at SUNY Potsdam may laserprint <B>one</B> copy of their work at no cost.  <B>Additional copies</B> may be printed by obtaining a <B>printing card</B> at the Barrington Union College Store.<P>

The general public may print to a laserprinter in a public facility <B>only</B> if they have a <B>printing card</B>.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Creating Mailing Labels with Word 5.0 or 5.1</FONT></B></CENTER>

1.  Find the sample document for the label size you are using.  These sample 
documents should be available in a folder titled SAMPLE DOCUMENTS 
which came with your Word 5.0 or 5.1 application software.

2.  Open the sample document for the mailing label size that you will be 
using.

3.  Select and CUT the lines at the top of the document (ie. Title, First Name, 
Last Name, Company, Street, City, Postal Code) and PASTE them into each 
table cell which you see in the lower portion of the document.

NOTE: Do not select or cut the first line -- DATA Hard Disk:Sample 
Documents:Mailing Labels:Address File.

4.  Create a NEW document (under the FILE menu) to store the data which 
will be used for your mailing labels.

5.  On the first line of this new document, type in the headings of the data 
categories (ie. Title, First Name, Last Name, Company, Street, City, Postal 
Code).  These categories must be separated by commas or tabs or can be placed 
in a Table format.

6.  Type in the mailing label data in each catagory for each person on your list, 
separating the data with the same separators that you used in the first line 
(commas, tabs, or table cells).

7.  Save your mailing label data under an appropriate file name.

8.  Highlight the "Hard Disk:Sample Documents:Mailing Labels:Address File" in the 
DATA line and type in the name of the file in which you have stored (saved) 
your mailing list information (the file name used in step 7 above).

9.  Save your "labels" file under an appropriate file name.

10.  To print the information from you mailing labels data file onto the labels:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Select your labels file
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Select PRINT MERGE from the FILE menu
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Select the settings in Print Merge that you want and click on the OK button.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-  Select PRINT from the FILE menu if needed.

<H1><EM><CENTER>Introduction to SUNY Potsdam's Telephone System</CENTER></EM></H1>
<p>
SUNY Potsdam presently has an AT&amp;T Definity G3R telephone switch on premise and an AT&T AUDIX(Audio Information Exchange) Voice Mail system. Student phone service is provided by ACUS(AT&amp;T College and University Solutions) to all students on behalf of SUNY Potsdam.  
<P>
All students who attend SUNY Potsdam and live on-campus will have voice mail and long-distance service when they arrive on campus.  There is no need to bring a telephone, answering machine, or wait in line to sign-up for phone service. You may begin placing calls as soon as you arrive.  When you check into your room your first day you will receive an envelope from ACUS which will contain your PSC(Personal Security Code) and instructions on how to use AUDIX for the first time. If you want a telephone credit card, just call ACUS at 1-800-445-6063. You will receive one monthly bill from ACUS which will include the calls you have placed from campus using your PSC and from off-campus using your Calling Card.You will also need to check your mailbox for your copy of the Student Technology Guide.  This guide will give you information on telephone, television and <A <A HREF = "ISD/Potsdam_IT/PotsdamComputers.html">computer services</A> that are available on-campus and how to use them.  You will also find information on sports, building hours, office phone numbers and much, much more.  In late September you will receive an insert to this guide which lists all your fellow students name, telephone and voice mail number.<p>
 <p>

Each student will receive their own  bill for only their charges rather than having one bill per room.  No more deciding who made what phone call or paying for calls that you didn't make.<p>
<p>
If a student wishes to have voicemail and long distance service they simply have to use their PSC.  However, if a student does not wish to have phone service they must call the ACUS Service Center at 1-800-445-6063 and ask tohave their account closed.  <p>

<H3>WHO?</H3>
<tt>	Student Health Service is staffed by a multidisciplinary team of
providers, including a full-time physician, nurse practitioners, nurses,
secretarial staff and a laboratory technician.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<H3>WHAT?</H3>
<tt>	The Watkins Student Health Service offers comprehensive health care to all
students.  The services include episodic illness/ injury care; health/wellness
counseling and education; gynecological exams and treatment, including
contraception; STD screening, counseling, and treatment for men and women;
allergy injections and immunizations; and a full range of preventive and
educational campus out-reach programs.  The Health Service also provides most
necessary laboratory services and distributes many commonly prescribed
medications.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>

<H3>WHEN?</H3>
<tt>Monday - Friday  8:00 a.m. - 4:30 P.M..</tt><p>

only.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>

<H3>WHERE?</H3>

<H3>WHY?</H3>
<tt>	The student health mission is to maintain an optimum environment for
students to pursue their academic work with a minimum of health related
interferences.  Goals of the Health Service are to deliver efficient care to
students with illness or injury, encourage optimal wellness through the

flu, birth control options, STD's, plus many more.  Programs may be arranged at
any time by contacting the Student Health Service Nurse Director.</tt><p>


<H3>STUDENT HEALTH ADVISORY COMMITTEE</H3>
<tt>	The Student Health Advisory Committee (SHAC) is composed of students,
faculty and staff.  It serves in an advisory nature to the Health Service on
issues such as policy, staff, programs, services and fees.  SHAC encourages
input from all Student Health Service clients.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>

<H3>FEES &amp; EXPENSES</H3>

<H3>CONFIDENTIALITY</H3>
<tt>	The student's right to privacy is strictly protected.  No one on or off
campus is given information without student permission.  (The exception is that
parents may obtain information on students under the age of 18 yrs.)</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>

<H3>STUDENT HEALTH SERVICE CLASS EXCUSE POLICY</H3>
<tt>	Responsibility for class attendance and for completion of assignments rest
primarily with the student, who should be encouraged to assume this
responsibility by communicating directly with faculty.  When indicated for
clinical management of a health problem, Student Health Service may recommend
alteration of academic requirements, such as class attendance or project
deadlines.</tt><p>
<tt>	The Health Service should not be expected to be involved in issuing
statements or excuses on a routine basis.  To do so creates an undesirable
climate for health care and contributes nothing to the assumption of
responsibility by students.</tt><p>
<tt>	The Student Health Service will, with the authorization of the student,
verify the nature and extent of illness if the faculty member wishes to
call.</tt><p>
<tt>	Excuses will never be given for classes missed due to a student
appointment or walk-in visit at Student Health Services.</tt><p>

<P>
At SUNY Potsdam, meal plans combine guaranteed meals with declining
balance accounts to give every student greater flexibility and
more value for their money when dining on campus.
<P>
Returning students who live on campus have four meal plan choices.
 They may choose an option that guarantees one, two or three meals
a day with a declining balance account for additional meals, snacks
and drinks, or an option with all declining balance.  Freshmen
students must choose between three meals a day or two meals a
day.  The meal plan choice and declining balance account are encoded
on your SUNYCard, which is your official college identification
card.
<P>
<I><B>1996/1997 Meal Plans - Spring Semester</B></I>
<P>
<U><I><B>Residential</B></I></U>
<P>
Meal Plan A - $1,050/semester  *3 meals per day, Monday-Friday,
2 meals per day, Saturday-Sunday/$50 declining balance
<P>
Meal Plan B - $950/semester  *2 meals per day, Monday-Sunday/$50
declining balance (minimum plan for Freshmen students)
<P>
Meal Plan C - $895/semester  *1 meal per day, Monday-Sunday/$250
declining balance
<P>
Meal Plan D - $895/semester  * All declining balance (minimum

<P>
Meal Plan E - $400/semester  *All declining balance
<P>
Meal Plan F - $150/semester  *All declining balance
<P>
Students who choose meal plans with guaranteed meals don't have
to worry about running out of money at the end of the semester.
 If you run out of declining balance funds, you may add to your
account at any time during the semester.  However, you should
keep in mind that if you have a balance remaining in your account
at the end of the academic year, it is not refundable.  Off-campus
accounts and residential meal plans with declining balances will
have remaining balances roll over from the fall to spring semester.
<I><B> The residential meal plan with all declining balance funds
will<U> NOT</U> roll over from fall to spring semesters.</B></I>
<P>
Traditional all-you-can-eat meals are provided in Lehman Dining
Hall.  Students who choose to eat in the Student Union, Crane
Snack Bar and The Gallery Restaurant can use their meal allowance
and pay for additional costs with their declining balance account,
Bear Express or cash.  A breakfast meal allowance is also permitted
in Cookies, Cream &amp; Company in the Student Union.

and off-campus accounts only.  Whatever you're hungry for - a
full meal, dinner, pizza, burgers, wings, salads, chips, ice cream
- it's on the menu at Potsdam.  Eating on campus can be in our
formal restaurant, The Gallery, or informal in the Bears' Den
which features an Italian menu and a big-screen TV.  Late-night
snacks and subs are just around the corner at the Student Union.
<P>
Most of the food served at SUNY Potsdam is made on campus, so
it's always fresh.  The campus bakery makes natural breads and
rich pastries daily, and every salad bar on campus offers a wide
variety of fruits, vegetables and cheese.  Quality service accompanies
the quality food that we serve at SUNY Potsdam.  Dining Service
employees, many of whom are students, take pride in their work
and take care to make you feel at home on campus.  All employees,
whether they are waiters, cashiers or clean-up crew, are trained
to give you friendly, professional service.
<P>
<U><I><B>LEHMAN DINING HALL</B></I></U>
<P>
Lehman Dining Hall is located adjacent to the Lehman residence
hall.  This facility is set up for students to use their meal
plans.  Cash, declining balance and Bear Express accounts are
also welcome if you do not have a residential meal plan or have
already used your daily meal allowance.  After paying one low
price at the top of the stairs, you have many options to choose
from.  Best of all, most areas are self-serve and you can eat
as much as you'd like.  It's all included in the meal price.
<P>
Lehman's features include two full salad bars, a vegetarian buffet,
a pizza/Italian food shop, a grill line, a traditional food line,
a sandwich bar and a build-your-own stir-fry station.  If this
doesn't fill you up, there are also soups, desserts, cereal, bagels,
soft serve yogurt and beverages.
<P>
Lehman is open Monday through Friday for breakfast (7:00am-9:30am),
lunch (11:00am-1:30pm), and dinner (4:30pm-8:00pm).  There is
a brunch on Saturday and Sunday from 9:00am-1:30pm.  The cash,

About: <A HREF="FYExperience.html">The First-Year Experience Program</A><BR>
<A HREF="Resources/Resources.html">RA Resources</A>
<HR>

Many studies of college students show that residential students not only do better in the classroom than do commuter students, but also have more time to devote to out-of-class activities. <P>



Many students say they like living on campus because they feel like they're a part of it all - they attend more out-of-class activities, and they're better informed about what's going on at the College, both academically and socially. <P>



At SUNY Potsdam, there are a lot of advantages to living on campus:
<UL><LI>  	You'll be able to make friends easily.  Living on campus makes it easy to find people to study with, to get help with an assignment, or just to talk when you need to sort things out.
<LI>  	You're close to the dining halls and to all of your classes.  The residence halls are conveniently located within a five-minute walk of all campus facilities.
<LI> 	Many students say they like living on campus because they feel like they're a part of it all - they attend more out-of-class activities, and they're better informed about what's going on at the College, both academically and socially. 
</UL>

	Because this "world" around you is so important, we require, with few exceptions, that all students live on campus for three academic years (transfer policies are slightly different). <P>
  

	To help you make the most of campus life, there are several staff members in each residence hall system, including Resident Assistants (RAs) - trained students; Residence Hall Directors (RDs) - master's degree-level professionals; and Assistant Directors for Residence Life - experienced professionals. All act primarily as student resources; they give you the "who, what and where of SUNY Potsdam."<P>


What to expect.<BR>

Each room is furnished with:<BR>

<UL><LI> 	Two beds (NOTE:  we have extra long-twin mattresses) 
<LI> 	Two desks and chairs      
<LI> 	Two dressers and closets    
<LI> 	Two lighted mirrors (in most halls)
<LI> 	One floor lamp   
<LI> 	A heat and smoke detector
<LI> 	Cable access for TV
</UL>

Each residence hall also offers:<BR>

	<UL><LI> Computer rooms linked to the campus 
 	mainframe and to each other (Macintosh and 
 	MS-DOS) open 24 hours, seven days a week
<LI> 	VCRs   
<LI> 	Kitchenettes (with microwaves)
<LI> 	Laundry facilities   
<LI> 	Study and TV lounges   
<LI> 	Vending machines   
<LI> 	Nearby parking   
<LI> 	Seminar rooms
</UL>

<H3>The First Year Experience (FYE) Program</H3>
	The FYE Program, housed in co-educational, centrally located Draime House, offers special facilities, personnel and programs targeted to the special needs of many first-year students.  We have found that within a community made up of only first-year students, relationships form quickly.  Students may also take advantage of help provided by peer academic mentors who live in Draime and can assist with specific course work.  The Learning Skills Center, located on the first floor of the hall, has tutorials and skill-building workshops to help students develop good study habits.<P>
 
	The FYE staff works with mentors, the Hall Council and students to offer programs that help students reach their potentialacademically, socially and personally.  Workshops are offered on subjects ranging from "How to Study for an Exam" to a weekend ropes course at the College's Star Lake campus.  The Fireside Chat series includes discussions with faculty and staff and sometimes an informal gathering with the College president. There is also a faculty-in-residence program, with a professor living in Draime full-time and assisting students with academic and social transition.<P>


<H3>International House</H3>
	Located in Bowman Hall, International House consists of a floor of rooms (or two floors, depending on the number of residents) for students who are either international students or U.S. citizens who want to live in a more diverse atmosphere.  A specially selected RA provides support to residents, and special programs allow students to experience a "mosaic" community of various cultures, languages, histories and perspectives.

<H3>Questions & Answers</H3>
<B>How are rooms and roommates assigned?</B><BR>

After you send in your deposit, you'll receive an information packet containing a housing card.  You'll be asked if you are a transfer or freshman, a smoker or not, early riser or not, etc.  The Office of Residence Life will match you with another student and assign you to a room based on your responses to these questions.<P>

<B>What are the residence halls like?</B><BR>

SUNY Potsdam has 9 modern, fully equipped residence halls that range from traditional single or double rooms to five-, six- and eight-person suites.  All-male, all-female and coed housing is available.<P>

<B>What kind of room will I be living in?</B><BR>

First-year students typically begin at Potsdam in traditional, double rooms with one other roommate.  As students go through the housing process each year, there are room options from single rooms to eight-student suites. <P>
 
<B>Can I bring my own appliances from home?</B><BR>

It depends on the appliance: Computers: Yes.  TV: Yes. Microwave Oven: No. Coiled Hot Pots: No. Lamps: Yes. Refrigerator: Yes, 3.5 cubic ft. (you may rent one through the Student Government Association). Phone: Yes, but a telephone and service that allows you to call on-campus telephone numbers are provided to you at no cost.<P>

<B>Can I paint my room a different color?</B><BR>

Yes, with approval of color. You may also want to build a loft bed to make more space.<P>

<B>Is there a linen service?</B><BR>

No, you must bring your own towels, blankets, sheets, pillowcases, pillows, etc.<P>

<B>Are there activities available in the hall where I live?</B><BR>

Many social, educational and cultural activities are sponsored and planned by the residence hall staff.  You're welcome to help plan these programsit's a great way to get involved and meet others in your hall. In 1993-94, over 1,100 programs involved over 12,000 participants in residence hall activities.<P>

<HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>The William C. Merwin Rural Services Institute (MRSI) is the primary public service organization of the State University of New York  <A HREF="http://www.potsdam.edu/PotsdamHome.html">College at Potsdam</A>. The Merwin RSI works to strengthen the connections between the College and communities in the North Country of New York State.   The Merwin RSI makes the College's resources available to help improve communities' social and economic well-being by providing technical services and other assistance to local governments, health care and social service providers, economic development agencies, labor, business and other appropriate organizations.<P>

The <A HREF="http://www.potsdam.edu/rsi_renamed.html"> Merwin RSI</A> was named in honor of William C. Merwin, thirteenth President of SUNY Potsdam (1989 - 1996) under whose leadership the Rural Services Institute was founded in 1990.</FONT>

<IMG  Align=Right SRC="merwin2.GIF"><BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;Any college or university which serves a democratic society, as does SUNY Potsdam, must recognize and freely accept the moral and legal obligation to inform the citizenry. Publicly supported colleges should be accessible to all qualified students and should be regional leaders in the movement to enhance the quality of life.<P>

Thus, SUNY Potsdam strives to be a part of, and not apart from, the community and society it serves.  This concerted effort leads to educational programs of a community development nature directed toward the public good of the North Country of New York.&quot;<P>

<CENTER><H2>Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy</H2></CENTER>
                         <H2 ALIGN=CENTER>SUNY Potsdam</H2><P>

In addition to providing library services, campus administration database management and institutional research, the <A HREF="/isd/ISDplan.html">Information Services Divison</A> supports computing, networking and information resources for the students,
faculty, staff and guests of SUNY Potsdam.  Computer
facilities and services are offered in support of teaching
and learning, research and public service.  Access to the
computer systems and networks owned and operated by SUNY
Potsdam imposes certain responsibilities upon users, in
accordance with College policy and local, state and federal
law.   Users accept the responsibility for utilizing
services in ways that are ethical, that demonstrate academic
integrity and respect for others who share this resource.
This policy is established in an effort to help users
understand what is expected of them.  It sets guidelines
regarding the issues of privacy and respect for property,
ownership of data, system security, and misuse of the
system.<P>


<H3><A NAME="Academic Integrity">Academic Integrity</A></H3>

Just as in any other aspect of a student's academic work,
SUNY Potsdam expects that students will use computing and
network resources in ways that are honest and ethical.
Actions that constitute academic dishonesty include:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>turning in someone else's work as your own
<LI>allowing someone to represent your work as his/her own
<LI>several people working on one paper and submitting it individually, as if each had done the paper alone
<LI>using another's work without proper acknowledgment
</UL><P>

<H3><A NAME="A Shared Resource">A Shared Resource</A></H3>

SUNY Potsdam computer and network services are available to
all faculty, staff and students.  Because there are so many
individuals who utilize this shared resource, respect for
the rights and needs of others is central to this policy.
To ensure access and service for all users, users must
refrain from any action which interferes with the system,
such as:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>using computer or network services for commercial purposes
<LI>excessive game playing which impairs the academic work of other students
<LI>sending excessive e-mail or messages locally or over the network such as chain letters, advertisements or solicitations
<LI>knowingly installing or running a program that will damage or place an undue burden on the system
<LI>knowingly acting in a manner that will disrupt normal operations of computers or the network
</UL><P>

<H3><A NAME="Privacy">Privacy</A></H3>

Technology should not be used in a manner that infringes
upon an individual's right to privacy.  The following
restrictions are imposed to protect your privacy, as well as
the privacy of others.  Users are prohibited from:<BR>

Computer systems and networks allow for a free exchange of
ideas and information.  This exchange serves to enhance
learning, teaching, critical thinking and research.  While
the constitutional right of free speech applies to
communication in all forms, we encourage civil and
respectful discourse.  College policy and local, state and
federal law do prohibit some forms of communication, to
include:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>obscenity
<LI>defamation
<LI>advocacy directed to incite or produce lawless action
<LI>threats of violence
<LI>disruption of the academic environment
<LI>harassment based on sex, race, disability or other protected status
<LI>anonymous or repeated messages designed to annoy, abuse or torment
</UL><P>

<H3><A NAME="Personal Responsibility">Personal Responsibility</A></H3>

Each individual who obtains a computer/e-mail account, or uses
the computers and network resources made available by SUNY Potsdam,
must understand that he/she is accountable for the policies set
forth in this document.  In addition, users assume responsibility
for:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>protection of his/her password
<LI>reporting any breech of system security
<LI>reporting unauthorized use of his/her account
<LI>changing his/her password on a regular basis
<LI>frequently making back-up copies of your work to ensure against loss
<LI>clearly label works and opinions as his/her own before they are widely distributed
</UL><P>

<H3><A NAME="Authority">Authority</A></H3>

The Information Services Division may access other's files for the maintenance of networks, computers and storage systems.  In all cases, individual's rights to privacy will be respected to the greatest degree possible.  Office staff may also routinely monitor and log usage data,
such as network connection times, CPU and disk utilization for each
user, security audit trails, and network loading.  Data
collected may be reviewed and further investigated should
evidence of violation of policy or law occur.  If necessary,
staff may monitor the activities and files of specific users
on their computers and networks.  Any staff member who
believes such monitoring is necessary should discuss the
problem and strategy for investigation with the appropriate Information Services Division Director.<P>

Any student who violates the policies set forth in this
document is subject to disciplinary action as defined in the
Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities and Conduct.
Faculty and staff who violate these policies are subject to
disciplinary action as defined in the Faculty Handbook.  All
violators may be subject to arrest according to local, state
and federal law.

We have 3 new report forms for you to use.<BR>

  These new forms are simplier to fill in and are divided into "no problems to report," "problems found in computing centers," and "supplies needed in these centers."<BR>

<LI> "<A HREF="#wait 2">wait 2</A>" - some modems do not work properly with this script command.  Comment out this line by placing a # sign in from on the command as shown here:<P>

<LI>If these changes to the <B>login.cmd</B> script do not resolve your SLIP dial-in problems, contact the Carson HELPDESK (<B>267-2083</B>) for technical assistance.  We will need to check whether your dial-in account (name/password) is working properly.  If it is, then your modem may be defective or we may need to have you bring your computer/modem in closer inspection.

Division Plan: 1996-2000</CENTER></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<p>
<b><u>I. Introduction</u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
	This document serves as Information Services' response to President Merwin's call for College-wide planning, as detailed in his August 24, 1995 address, <i>Planning for Change: A Rationale</i>.  Each of the four departments within Information Services (Central Computing, Distributed Computing, the College Libraries and Institutional Research) developed a departmental plan, following departmental planning processes.  These departmental plans are attached to the end of this document.  This document was based upon the departmental plans and was written with consultation and feedback from the directors of the four departments.<p>
<p>
<b><u>II. Information Services Mission Statement</u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
	The mission of the Information Services Division is <i>to anticipate and provide information resources and services in support of the College's educational, administrative and public service operations</i>.  Information Services as a division combines and coordinates the College's efforts in the information resources and services areas, in support of current and projected needs.  The Information Services Division develops strategies in collaboration
with other departments to help them understand their needs and plan so as to more fully utilize available technology and services.  <p>
<p>
	Since the Information Services Division is a service-oriented area, i.e., works to support the institution's mission, goals and operations, it is critical that the Information Services mission be in alignment with the College's mission.  Ideally, the College's plan would be developed before the Information Services plan could be fully articulated.  Technology plans are severely limited if they have not been shaped by adequate discussion of the educational mission and objectives of the institution.  The risk is that a technology plan might be adopted that could limit or unduly influence educational options before the institution's teaching/learning goals have been clearly developed.  However, it is part of the responsibility of Information
Services to inform and provide leadership to the College in the area of
information technology and services.  Hence Information Services has a dual role -- to serve as well as to lead.<p>
<p>
While the Information Services Division has a common mission, it includes departments with unique characteristics.  Because of this, it is worth stating the missions of each of the departments:<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>	* Central Computing's Mission: Be responsible for providing reliable service to end users needing access to student information systems, campus administrative systems, optical scanning services and access to Central Office gateway connections.<p></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>	* Distributed Computing/Telemedia's Mission:  To increase the effectiveness, productivity and creativity of students, faculty, staff and administrators by:<p></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>	-providing outstanding voice, video and desktop data services 	and support based upon assessed customer requirements;<p>
	-supporting and promoting the College's technological competitiveness in higher education;<p>
	-keeping the campus well-informed about our services and 	relevant
technological trends and developments; and by,<p>
	-collaborating with other campus departments and SUNY 	schools to meet our goals and support the mission of the 	College; and<p>
To create an exciting, challenging place to work that enhances the quality of life for every member of the department.<p></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>	* The College Libraries Mission:  To support the mission of the College by developing collections and services that make the Libraries integral to the learning process, both within and beyond the classroom.  In doing so, the libraries strive:</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>	-to promote information literacy among the college community 	as a necessary pre-requisite to success in an increasingly 	complex and technological world;<p>
	-to provide access to resources that reflect a broad range of 	perspectives, viewpoints, and approaches;<p>
	-to incorporate innovative technology wherever appropriate to 	extend collections and services beyond the physical walls of the 	library;<p>
	-to balance opportunities for off-site access with the need for 	on-site ownership.<p>
	Recognizing that students are their primary clientele, the College Libraries will also seek to support the scholarly and research needs of faculty and staff.  The Libraries will, as feasible, extend services to the citizens of the region.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>	* The Institutional Research Mission:  To coordinate and direct the
institutional research activities at the College.  As the areas of student enrollment and faculty productivity has taken on an increased importance as of late, the Institutional Research office plays a crucial role in providing timely information to support the decision-making needs of the institution.</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
	<p>
<b><u>III. Division Objectives and Goals</u></b><p>
<b></b><p>
	The objectives and goals of the Information Services Division are as
follows:<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>	* Facilitate the mission of SUNY Potsdam.<p>
	* Provide information access to faculty, staff and students in as functional and transparent a manner as is possible.<p>
	* Work collaboratively with information resource or service users to
articulate their needs and to determine how to best meet these needs.<p>
	* Provide appropriate and timely service to user requests.<p>
	* Continually strive to improve and extend services through the creative use of information technology.<p>
	* Conduct ongoing strategic planning.<p>
	* Continue to be aware of and monitor emerging technologies so as to position the College to make most appropriate use of new technologies ("leading edge" where appropriate).<p>
	* Encourage and facilitate the use of technology to support innovation and effectiveness in teaching and learning.<p>
	* Encourage the development of information and computer literacy.  Help teach students (as well as faculty and staff) how to identify, find, use and evaluate information to solve problems or make decisions.<p>
	* Continue to maintain the College's reputation for excellence in Information Technology (ensure technological competitiveness; make the College more attractive to SUNY resource providers, prospective students and their parents and potential donors).<p>
	* Continue to maintain a presence within SUNY as an active participant in SUNY-wide information technology initiatives.<p>
	* Facilitate the efficient and effective operation of the College and increase the productivity of faculty, staff and students in their various roles (teaching, learning, research, service and management of college resources) via access to information resources and services.<p>
	* Support the development of our human resources (e.g., enhance job
satisfaction and sense of personal achievement by providing opportunities to develop and refine job skills).<p>
	* Provide training and "awareness" opportunities to keep interested
information technology users up to date.<p>
	* Develop innovative technologies for sharing information and instruction across the campus and well as off-campus.<p>
	* Continue to monitor opportunities for distance learning and develop programs where feasible and cost-effective.<p>
	* Provide public service when feasible and appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	In addition to the above general Information Services goals and
objectives, the Information Services supports the following <i>Campus Computing Goals</i>, which were adopted by the campus two years ago and were designed to meet the computing needs of the campus over the five year period 1994 - 1998:<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1.	Enhance access to information and promote effective  	communication for all members of the campus community.<p>
2.	Maximize effectiveness of administrative staff by enabling the 	efficient collection, processing and analysis of information for 	instructional, institutional and research needs.<p>
3.	Maximize effectiveness of faculty for curricular development, 	classroom teaching, advising and research.<p>
4.	Improve students' information acquisition skills and enhance their personal productivity and professional options.<p>
5.	Establish efficient and effective use of computer acquisition 	funds in order to minimize equipment, training, and maintenance costs for information systems and their users.<p>
6.	Provide an on-going process of planning for and development of computing resources which allows for annual review and 	updating.<p>
7.	Provide information technology related public service as time and resources allow.</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<p>
	Finally, specific goals and objectives for each of the four ISD departments can be found in the attachments.<p>
<p>
<b><u>IV. Division Initiatives</u></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>	A) How can your division improve the programs and services it offers?</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Perhaps the most significant arrangement that could be made to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Information Services is to build teams within the ISD that draw upon the experience, skill and talents across the Division.  These teams would address those goals/needs the ISD departments have most in common, such as:<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>	- HELPDESK-based services<p>
	- training<p>
	- Web development in support of information technologies<p>
	- centralized support for host services <p>
	- information technology support for faculty and curricular 	 	  development (especially the proposed library pilot project to work more closely with academic departments noted below)<p>
	- information technology support for administrative offices<p>
	- the design of database systems for individual/office use and a 	  Web browser interface to databases via the WWW.</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<p>
	In addition, an extensive lists of initiatives for improving programs and services were received from the departments, and an representative collection is shown below:<p>

<p>
<b>	B) What new programs should be developed to address emerging student
needs?</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	There are a number of new programs that Information Services will play a significant role in developing in response to emerging student needs:<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>	* Implement and manage the campus residential wiring project which will provide students with direct, high-speed access to our campus network and the Internet from their residential hall room.<p>
	* Support the College's efforts to provide distance learning opportunities to reach non-traditional or place bound students.  We will likely be a partner in the BOCES distance learning initiative that will be developing soon.  In addition, we may partner with SUNY Oswego on the development of a "SUNY Channel" which would serve all of Central and Northern New York via cable television.<p>
	* Investigate the development of kiosk-based access to the college-wide information system (BearFacts), likely based on a World Wide Web interface.  In addition, purchase or develop software that would allow students (or faculty/staff) to access BANNER through the WWW via a desktop computer.  With such systems in place, students could easily access their course schedules, billing information, etc. from a kiosk or a computer.<p>
	* Investigate the utilization of VR (Voice Response) technology which coupled with BANNER could allow course registration by phone and would provide an alternate vehicle for accessing college information that could be more convenient to students.  This has the potential to reduce the number of times a distant student would have to travel to campus.<p>
	* Promote and support the College's efforts to ensure that every student has an opportunity to become "literate" with information technology.  This will be accomplished by working with faculty to support the embedding of computing and information-based research experiences within disciplinary contexts.<p>
	* Make the Libraries' CD-ROM indexes available over the campus network.<p>
	* Develop a bibliographic instruction computer laboratory in the Crumb Library.<p>
	* Continue the development of new high-tech (or "smart") classrooms, i.e. classrooms that contain technology for computer presentation and/or multimedia computer stations.<p>
	* Expanding technical assistance in student computing centers by hiring more student workers for these facilities.</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<p>
<b>	C) What new approaches should be used to market these programs?</b><p>
<p>
	The World Wide Web is rapidly becoming a dominant communication medium for educational institutions and businesses.  Therefore, it is incumbent upon the institution to base a significant portion of the marketing effort for the College's programs and recruitment efforts on the World Wide Web.  In addition, more time should be invested in evangelizing and promoting technology on campus, thus raising the profile of SUNY Potsdam as a technologically sophisticated campus.<p>
<p>
<b>	D) What programs or services can be eliminated  without sacrificing quality and access?</b><p>
<p>
	There are a number of programs or services that will be considered for either elimination, reduction or consolidation with other programs or services: <p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>	Distributed Computing/Telemedia is considering consolidating the Carson, Levitt and Kellas HELPDESKs into one HELPDESK facility within Kellas Hall.  In addition, consolidating student computing centers into one facility would allow longer hours, more continuous and effective technical support, and enhanced security, but a suitable space that could be made available has yet to be identified.<p>
<p>
	The Libraries will conduct a review of the appropriateness of staff job responsibilities in the hope of identifying and eliminating duplication of effort or activities deemed low priority or non-essential.  In addition, the entire library collection will be reviewed and evaluated for its appropriateness to the institution's current curricular offerings.  With the advent and increasing availability of electronic information resources, the budget balance between print and electronic resources will have to be closely
monitored.  It is likely that budget allocations for print-based materials will decline in relationship to those for acquiring or accessing electronic resources and document delivery systems.  Finally, a study will be undertaken to analyze the potential cost savings of consolidating the two physical library locations into a single location.<p>
<p>
	Institutional Research will conduct a review of the external surveys that are received by the College and may determine that the College does not have the resources to respond to some of them.  Ideally, criteria would be developed to help determine whether it's worth the time to respond to a given survey.  If a survey is not from a reputable state or national organization or from an organization for which a response is crucial to our admissions efforts, it may not be acted upon.<p>
<p>
	Central Computing has proposed establishing a "data warehouse" and has considered developing a disaster recovery plan, but will likely not proceed with either of these projects due to the lack of resources.</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<p>
<b>	E) How will the division address the need for quality academic programs that provide job skills and ultimately careers within the context of our liberal arts mission?</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	While no academic programs are contained within Information Services, each of the four departments offers employment opportunities that provide student workers with professional-level experiences and skills that will complement their academic programs and enhance their employability and career options.  Each of the departments will consider developing professional internship
opportunities for students as well.<p>
<p>
	The Information Services division would like to support academic program initiatives involving computer literacy in any way possible.  In addition, the division would strongly encourage and support a true undergraduate program in Information Systems.<p>
<p>
	The College Libraries have worked directly with academic departments to help develop meaningful course assignments which build effective information literacy skills.  By becoming more effective and independent learners and researchers, students acquire skills and habits of mind that will serve them well either in a profession or in continued studies.<p>
<p>
<b><u>V. Efficiencies</u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
	<b>A) Through technology?</b><p>
<p>
	Technology is an integral part of all we do in Information Services.
Improvements and efficiencies through the use of technology can be found throughout this planning document.  In addition, each of the departments identified specific initiatives in this area.<p>
<p>
	The College Libraries have made significant use of technology and are
currently working to expand access to the electronic CD-ROM indexes (presently only accessible within the Library) by making them available campus wide through the campus network.<p>
<p>
	Institutional Research will continue to modify Institutional Research reports to be incorporated into the Campus Information System (BearFacts).  An Institutional Research frequently asked questions (FAQ) page will be created on BearFacts.  The IR office will better utilize telecommunications for a more efficient exchange of data between outside agencies (such as SUNY Central and Federal agencies) and SUNY Potsdam (e.g., the current SUNYFEX pilot project with the Library Survey).  In addition, The IR office will increasingly take
advantage of on-line data from SUNY Central, Federal Agencies (IPEDS CD's and on-line access to Federal statistical data through the Web) and other sources of statistical data.<p>
<p>
	Distributed Computing/Telemedia will continue publishing documentation and other HELPDESK-related material via the campus WWW server and continue disseminating departmental information via local-access-only WWW server.  The department will continue to promote just-in-time training and technical support using Timbuktu.<p>
	<p>
	<b>B) Through cooperative arrangements with other departments within the
College?</b><p>
<p>
	Three library faculty are currently working on a pilot project to develop a closer working relationship with discipline faculty.  These three library faculty are working with the Sociology Department on a plan to improve collection development, to design appropriate exercises to test students' information seeking skills, to help incorporate information research skills into the curriculum, and to work directly with students with information research problems.<p>
<p>
	Distributed Computing/Telemedia plans to continue collaborating with College Relations and other ISD departments to develop, promote and manage <i>BearFacts</i>.  DCTM also strongly supports efforts to give faculty more release time or other rewards for developing and utilizing technology in the classroom.  In addition, the College providing more support for individual faculty and administrative development activities (skill development; testing/proto-typing; exploring; developing) would be mutually beneficial.<p>
<p>
Institutional Research will take a close look at external surveys, as
mentioned earlier.  The office will take the surveys that the college hasagreed should receive a response and evaluate them to see if the questions areprimarily relevant to another office.  If the majority of data requested by thesurvey is more appropriately supplied by another office, then the survey willbe assigned to that office.  This will cut out the delays of waiting tocommunicate information back and forth between offices.  Institutional Researchwill also work with departments to develop and implement more efficient ways to
"clean up" database resources.<p>
<p>
<b>	C) Through cooperative arrangements with neighboring institutions?</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Distributed Computing/Telemedia will continue to develop collaborative, cooperative projects with our sister institutions (especially SUNY Canton and SUNY Plattsburgh) such as a SUNY-based virtual HELPDESK and training sessions and presentations employing distance learning technology (e.g., PictureTel).  DCTM will continue to support the PictureTel-based TeleNursing program with SUNY Plattsburgh.  Other possible distance learning ventures include the St.
Lawrence/Lewis County BOCES project and the possibility of collaborating with SUNY Oswego on a SUNY Channel.  In the near future, we will explore the feasibility/practicality of collaborating within Associated Colleges on media-development and other technologies where we can benefit from the skill and experience of our colleagues.  DCTM also will continue to support technology conferences/programs sponsored by the Associated Colleges.<p>
<p>
	The College Libraries have a long tradition of cooperation through SUNY, the local 3Rs Council, and through the Associated Colleges, and see such cooperation as an ongoing commitment.  In addition, the Directors of the SUNY Potsdam and SUNY Canton Libraries have met to discuss partnering possibilities and have presented preliminary reports of their findings.<p>
<p>
	Central Computing did evaluate forming a cooperative arrangement with SUNY Canton in the area of administrative computing.  After a discussion with Canton personnel, it was determined that without additional resources and a considerable investment of time, no effective way of merging systems or databases could be accomplished.  The two institutions are quite different in character and mission.<p>
<p>
	Currently, SUNY Potsdam's Institutional Research Office exchanges information and report generating capabilities with other SUNY institutions in the SICAS program.  The Coordinator of Institutional Research currently chairs the SUNY-wide SICAS Functional Area User Group (FAUG) for Institutional Research.<p>
<p>
	<b>D) Through streamlining curricula or programs?</b><p>
<p>
	The Information Services departments are currently investigating the
elimination, streamlining and/or consolidation of a variety of services and programs.  These initiatives are listed under section <b>IV D)</b> above.<p>
<p>
<b><u>VI. Implementation Issues</u></b><u></u><p>
<u></u><p>
	The projects that Information Services would like to initiate include the following:<p>

<b><u>VII. Other Suggestions</u></b><u></u><p>
<u></u><p>
1) Faculty use of technology<p>
<p>
	The college should work to place a greater emphasis on faculty redesigning courses and curricula to utilize educational technology.  Faculty should also be encouraged to develop courses suitable for delivery via distance learning.  Incentives such as release time or development stipends should continue to be offered to encourage such activities.  These types of activities should also be "counted" as scholarship (<i>integration</i>, <i>application</i> and <i>teaching</i> of Boyer's categories).<p>
<p>
2) Encourage World Wide Web based information distribution<p>
<p>
	The College should promote and support campus Web-based information and projects which enhance and augment recruitment efforts and improve campus communication and the dissemination of timely information.  In addition, the College should promote and support the strategy of publishing campus information on the Web first, then encouraging others to only print what they need from the Web; that is, a distribute-and-print strategy vs. a print-and-distribute strategy.<p>
<p>
3) Sharing of Clerical Staff between offices.<p>
<p>
	Whenever feasible, consolidate clerical staff where duplication occurs.  For example, the College might be able to consolidate budget responsibilities for an area under one person, or consolidate clerical staff between departments in a division.  In addition, when offices share the same floor of a building it might be possible to share clerical staff.  Clerical staff that are underutilized during "off times" during the year could be reassigned during those times to an office which may be at peak work load.  For example, secretaries in academic departments might be reassigned during the summer to offices that could utilize additional assistance at that time.<p>
<p>
4) Climate of Cooperation<p>
<p>
	It is extremely important within the campus community to establish a climate of cooperation, where departments feel they are working together toward a common set of goals, rather than competing among themselves for ever more scarce resources.<p>
<p>
<b><u>VIII. Conclusion</u></b><p>
<b></b><p>
	The Information Services division has appreciated this opportunity to reflect on its mission and goals.  This planning effort will allow staff to re-focus their energies on projects mutually beneficial to the division and the College.  In addition, this process has allowed us to identify and prioritize the new projects that we feel are crucial to maintaining the College's technological competitiveness.<u></u><p>

<H3>This session will discuss how one campus grappled with the support demands
placed on its staff through the implementation of a Technology HelpDesk.
We will discuss what steps we took in our plans and implementation of the
HelpDesk, and demonstrate our Web-based on-line documentation. However,
we believe the true value of this session will come from the exchange of
ideas by support staff throughout SUNY (yourselves).<HR></H3>

<CENTER><H2>Electronic Mail (Email) Policy at SUNY Potsdam</H2></CENTER><P>
<B>Obtaining an Email Account:</B><P>

In order to use electronic mail at SUNY Potsdam it is necessary to have an
email "account" or usercode which is unique for each user.  This  prevents
anonymous mail and establishes the electronic address for each email user
to which electronic mail can be received from other email users on- or
off-campus.  Each email account is protected from unauthorized access, in
part, by requiring the use of a unique password to identify the legitimate
user.<P>

Any student, faculty or staff member of SUNY Potsdam, who provides proper
college identification, may request an email account.  While SUNY Potsdam
does not prohibit the use of email for personal reasons, users should
recognize that the primary intention of providing email service is to
support the educational mission of the college and the conduct of its daily business.<P>

<BR><P>

<B>Postmaster Responsibilities for Email:</B><P>

It may be necessary at times for the local SUNY Potsdam Electronic Mail Postmaster (<A HREF="http://www.employee.potsdam.edu/dctm/brouwedf/brouwer.html">David Brouwer</A> -- email:  <a href=mailto:postmaster@potsdam.edu>postmaster</A>) to read an electronic mail message which has failed to reach its destination in order to determine, if possible, the intended addressee and redirect the message to the correct address.  However, it is not otherwise the practice of the postmaster to read nor to discuss the content of any message.<P>

<BR><P>

<B>Privacy of Email:</B><P>

It is impossible to ensure the confidentiality of any electronic messages
stored or communicated through our computing facilities. As pointed out by
other universities, "The privacy of electronic mail is somewhere between
that of a letter and a postcard."  While confidentiality cannot be ensured, all email is considered private and confidential.  Except as noted under Postmaster Responsibilities for Email above, email is <B>not</B> to be read by SUNY Potsdam staff or any others with sufficient computer system privileges to do so.<P>

<BR><P>

<B>Hierarchy of Communication with Email:</B><P>

Email is intended to be a person-to-person form of electronic
communication.  It is addressed to a specific individual and does not
adhere to any chain of command in its delivery.  Anyone may write to
anyone.<P>

<BR><P>


<B>Ethics of Email:</B><P>

The "<A HREF="/isd/policies/AUP.html">SUNY Potsdam's Information Technology Acceptable Use Policy</A>" applies to email.<P>

<!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=4>Prior to registration each semester, participants are encouraged to meet with staff for an Academic Planning Meeting.  In this meeting, students and staff discuss academic programs, tentative schedules, course loads, etc.  An SSS Academic Planning Meeting helps students to be better informed and prepared for their academic advising appointments.  <B>An SSS Academic Planning Meeting does not take the place of a meeting with assigned <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="GetFacultyAdvisor.html">faculty advisors</A>.</B><BR>

Also, before dropping, adding, or withdrawing from a course, SSS encourages students to discuss their plans with SSS staff and their faculty advisors.  Students' choices may have unforeseen consequences.</FONT><BR>

<!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=4>Each semester, SSS contacts participants' instructors for feedback about their academic progress.  There are two reasons for this:<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=14  SRC="http://www.potsdam.edu/gif/Dots/redball.GIF">to congratulate participants when their classes are going well</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=14  SRC="http://www.potsdam.edu/gif/Dots/redball.GIF">and to alert them to any probelms before it is too late.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

The information gained from reviewing Academic Progress Reports can help participants improve their performance or can confirm that their current strategies are working.</FONT><BR>

<!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=4><!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="MoreTutoring.html">Tutoring</A> is available in most classes during the regular academic year.  Requests for tutors are made at the Tutoring Center which is located in Sisson 114.  The Center is open for three hours a day Monday through Friday.  Staff begin taking requests for tutors approximately a week into each semester.<BR>
<BR>
When a tutoring request is made, a staff person takes relevant information and frequently makes an immediate tutoring assignment or referral.  If a tutor is not available, the student is asked to return in 2-3 days to pick up a tutor's name and phone number.  Most students have an opportunity to choose between one-to-one tutoring and small group tutoring.  Small group tutoring has been found to work well in areas such as calculus, foreign languages, statistics, psychology and economics.  SSS provides guidelines and assistance in establishing study groups.  A student may also be referred to other resources on campus.</FONT><BR>

<!-- Font Tag --><B><FONT SIZE=5><CENTER>Peer Mentoring Program</CENTER></FONT></B><BR>

<!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=4>The first year at a new college holds many challenges.  Studies show that students who have a friendly, knowledgeable person to talk to feel more satisfied at the end of the year than those who do not.  That is why we began the PEER MENTORING PROGRAM at Student Support Services (SSS).  This program pairs freshman and transfer SSS participants with a SUNY Potsdam Junior or Senior.  The Peer Mentor and new student meet periodically throughout the semester to talk about what the campus has to offer and how things on campus work.  Peer Mentors can talk with students about time management, recreational opportunities and community events.  The student can ask his/her Peer Mentor questions about specific concerns or just talk about whatever is on his/her mind.  We would like to invite you to come in and see if this Program is for you.<BR>
<BR>
The goal of the Peer Mentoring Program and SSS is to provide the academic support necessary to help students remain in school and reach graduation.  In addition ot the Peer Mentoring Program, SSS provides to its participants tutoring, counseling (personal and financial), academic planning, study skills assistance, and career exploration.  Students may also be involved in workshops and group interation opportunities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>If you would like more information about the Peer Mentoring Program, please stop into the Student Support Services Office at 119 Sisson Hall or call 267-2347.</B><BR>
<BR>
If you are already participating in a mentoring program on campus, please stop in and explore the other services available through SSS.</FONT><BR>

Resumes and other materials are forwarded to the employers, who contact students by phone for interviews at their site or on our campus.  This is a convenient system for some career fields, but should not be your primary job search method.  We encourage seniors to leave us 5 resumes so that we can send them to employers, who are seeking their qualifications.  <H3>JOB VACANCY LISTS. </H3> We subscribe to over 20 different vacancy listings.  They are arranged by field of employment, for example:  teaching, art, social services, business, international, music, environmental, federal jobs, etc.  Vacancies sent to us directly by employers are posted on the campus, and also mailed to alumni.  <H3>GRADUATE SCHOOL ASSISTANCE.</H3>  Library references and individual assistance in planning are available.

At this event a range of school representatives are available for information. We have the computerized GRE study guide available for students to use in the office.  <H3>SUNYCDO JOB FAIR.</H3>  In cooperation with other SUNY campuses, we co-sponsor a state-wide job fair for Potsdam seniors and alumni.  This year it is scheduled for April 13, 1997 at Westchester Community College. <H3>PRESENTATIONS.</H3>  Our staff is glad to visit classes, residence halls, fraternities and sororities, academic organization meetings, campus organizations, and special interest groups to describe services, answer questions, or give workshops.  Just call and ask for Karen to work out the details.  <P>

<H1><CENTER>SUNY Potsdam 
and the
First Year 
Experience</CENTER></H1>

The SUNY Potsdam Residence Life staff extends a warm welcome to you, the first year student and parents. <P>


There are many opportunities open to college students as they begin an academic career - we encourage full participation to get the most out of your time at Potsdam!<P>


This brochure is an introduction to one such opportunity for first year students - The First Year Experience (FYE) Program.  The FYE program combines three major components - <BR>

Residential, Academic and Programmatic - 
to enhance the following:
    <UL><LI> academic skills preparation 
<LI>     student leadership 
<LI>     smooth transition to college from high school 
<LI>     successful overall college experience
</UL>


<H3>THE FYE PROGRAM</H3>

There has been a good deal of research into how students can become more successful in college.  A student who has at least one other significant person at the school (roommate, friend, professor, administrator) whom they can rely on for assistance or just to talk with, has a better chance of remaining in school until graduation and performing well than the student without that connection.  The First Year Experience (FYE) program is designed to respond to specific concerns of students encountering their first year in college by providing such contacts, exposing students to a "World of Ideas", and focusing on the challenges of moving from high school to college.<P>


College students begin to learn how to make many of their own decisions once they get to school.  The three major components to the FYE program listed above are a solid foundation on which to enter SUNY Potsdam, but the student has to choose to participate!  We think after you know more about the aspects of the FYE program you'll choose it as an option.<P>



<H3>RESIDENTIAL </H3>

The residential setting is either in Draime Hall or a section of Bowman East or West.  We set aside entire floors for first year students because many want to "go through it all together" with others who are experiencing college for the first time.  The residential component consists of:
    <UL><LI> specially trained resident assistants 
<LI>     peer academic mentors 
<LI>     residence hall director 
<LI>     specifically assigned facilities
</UL>

<H4>Resident Assistants</H4> 

The Resident Assistants (RAs) are essential to every residence hall at SUNY Potsdam.  They are returning students oriented toward providing resources and support for the residents on their floors.  The First Year Experience RAs are specially trained to better understand the needs of first year students and present programs and information to help students succeed inside and outside of the classroom.  Many have been residents of the FYE program in the past.<P>



<H4>Peer Academic Mentors </H4>

Peer Mentors are upperclass students who are assigned to each of the FYE floors.  They offer informal guidance on academics and plan social activities for their residents.  They are a good resource, in addition to the RAs, to find out about college throughout your first year.<P>



<H4>Residence Hall Director</H4> 

The RD is a graduate-level staff member who has typically had experience while an undergraduate in residence life or another student service office.  The RD supervises the RA staff and assists students with personal, social, and academic difficulties.  The RD is a good person to have living in the hall 24 hours a day.<P>


<H4>Facilities</H4>
 
First year students are assigned based on their preferences for the FYE program and are placed in a traditional double room with another first year student who has expressed an interest in the program.  Furniture, equipment, space use, and storage space are all discussed in the general college information provided to incoming students.<P>



<H3>ACADEMIC </H3>

Because more than 85% of a student's waking time is spent outside the classroom, Residence Life is committed to complementing the academic mission of SUNY Potsdam and provides a great deal of academic support in the FYE program.<P>
 

<H4>Faculty-in-Residence </H4>

We think having an opportunity to interact informally with faculty outside the classroom is a great way for students to learn - about themselves, the College, and their instructors.  Faculty present educational and social programs, invite students in for an evening meal, and can be seen on Opening Day offering an exhausted parent a cold drink!<P>


<H4>Academic Skills Programs </H4>

There is no more direct link to the academic aspect of college than for Residence Life staff to provide workshops on skills required to succeed in ones course work.  Programs on notetaking, study skills, text book reading techniques, test taking, time management strategies, and course selection are all offered.<P>



<H3>PROGRAMMATIC </H3>

A "program" is anything planned by students or staff and presented to the residents of the FYE program for their benefit.  Some types of programs have already been mentioned but there are a few specifically designed for the students of the FYE program that may interest students and parents.<P>


<H4>Star Lake Weekend </H4>

Begun several years ago as a way to get FYE students to meet one another, the Star Lake Weekend program (usually a Saturday early in September) takes students to our Star Lake campus for a day of Ropes Course, New Games, recreational time, and a noon meal - all to introduce students to their peers and to the wonderful Star Lake facility owned by the College.<P>


<H4>A Major Affair</H4>
 
Each semester the staff of the FYE program plans an evening for students to meet faculty members from all the departments at SUNY Potsdam to discuss their major (courses to take, career possibilities, faculty who teach in the dept., etc.).  This program has evolved into one of the most effective ever - having so many faculty in the FYE residence hall for informal academic discussions one-to-one with first year students.<P>


<H4>Transitional Programs</H4>
 
The FYE staff provides a wide range of programs specifically geared toward the life of someone leaving high school, home, family, and friends and entering the new world of college.  Issues discussed include: homesickness, relationships, health and nutrition, decision-making around drugs and alcohol, going home for the first holiday break after being at school, managing your finances - the list goes on.<P>



<H3>HOW TO SIGN UP</H3>

You may have already received information from SUNY Potsdam, some of which included housing forms.  You can indicate your interest in the FYE program right on the housing sign-up form and we will assign space on a first-received, first-served basis.  <P>


If you have any questions about the FYE program, please don't hesitate to call us at 315-267-2350.  We think this program is a great way for students to begin a successful college career!<P>

A MESSAGE FROM THE INTERIM PRESIDENT

Honors Program
In response to feedback from various faculty, staff and students, 
as well as Interim President Jean A. Scott's own desire to 
recognize our best students, she is organizing a committee to 
develop a proposal for an Honors Program at SUNY Potsdam.

Dr. Scott has asked interim Associate Provost, Sandra Sarkela, to 
chair the committee.  In addition, she has asked interim Vice 
President for Student Services, Chris Strong and Susan Sweeney, 
co-chair of the Presidential Scholars committee, to be part of 
this group.

President Scott would like to hear from any interested faculty and 
staff who would like to serve on this committee, or who have ideas 
about an Honors Program that they would like to share with the 
committee. Please respond by February 7.

PRESIDENTIAL SEARCH UPDATE

The Presidential Search Committee met on Friday, January 24 to 
review applications and to develop a schedule for the interview 
process.

Applications have been received from 27 different states 
throughout the country. The applicant pool includes a wide range 
of candidates, many of whom are presidents or top administrators 
from public and private institutions of higher education.

The committee has narrowed the field to 10 candidates whom the 
committee will interview by telephone. The committee hopes to 
complete the telephone interviews in early February, with the goal 
of inviting three to five finalists to interview on campus.

The names of applicants and nominees as well as their 
institutional affiliation will remain confidential until such time 
as they become a finalist and are invited to interview on campus.

1997 Chautauqua Faculty Development Program - NSF Short 
Courses for College Teachers
Chautauqua Short Courses are an annual series of forums in which 
scholars at the frontiers of various sciences meet intensively for 
several days with undergraduate college teachers of science. The 
series is held at colleges and universities throughout the United 
States as well as at selected special sites. These forums provide 
an opportunity for invited scholars to communicate new knowledge, 
concepts, and techniques directly to college teachers in ways 
which are immediately beneficial to their teaching. The primary 
aim is to enable undergraduate teachers in the sciences to keep 
their teaching current. From year to year, there is an attempt to 
rotate courses among different regions of the country. Courses are 
offered in the following areas: Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, 
Computers, Critical Thinking, Environment, Geology, Mathematics, 
Minority Retention, Physics, Science and Society, Social Science 
and Technology.

For 1997 there will be no Participant Course Registration Fees. 
This is made possible by a grant from the National Science 
Foundation. An application fee of $40 should be enclosed with the 
application form. The application fees are used to help cover 
costs not covered by the NSF grant. Participants or their 
institutions pay the cost of lodging, meals and travel. 

For a complete listing of courses, dates, field center locations, 
etc., check out the Chautauqua Short Course Home page at: 
http://www.engrng.pitt.edu/~chautauq/. In general, 
applications should be sent in as early as possible. Ordinarily, 
Field Centers make selections of participants at least 6 weeks 
prior to the beginning of a course.

Faculty Undergraduate Summer Research Program (F-USRP)
This program was designed to encourage the involvement of 
outstanding students with faculty members on research and creative 
endeavors projects during the summer months. Students will receive 
a stipend of $2,400 for ten weeks of full-time assistance. The 
program is intended for outstanding students who will be returning 
for at least one full semester as an undergraduate after 
completing the proposed summer project. In addition, a double 
occupancy room will be provided free of charge. The faculty member 
will receive a grant of up to $500 for expenses related to the 
proposed research. Deadline: February 19, 1997.

Research and Creative Endeavors Program for 1996-97
The Research and Creative Endeavors Program is designed to 
encourage faculty to plan their professional growth and to seek 
and attract external funding for their work. As in the past, in 
making awards, the Committee will especially emphasize projects 
that have the potential to encourage new faculty, women and 
minorities; to support research and creative endeavors across the 
disciplines; and to attract external resources. It is anticipated 
that most requests for 1996-97 will be within the $500-$2,000 
range. NOTE: Changes have been made to the old R&CE application 
form. All applications must be submitted on the revised 1996-97 
form. Please call x2131 to request a copy of the revised form. 
Deadline: February 5, 1997. Next deadline April 9, 1997.

FS&G/Affirmative Action Travel Program
The offices of Affirmative Action and Faculty Scholarship and 
Grants have travel funds available again this year to help support 
faculty scholarship. Funding will only be considered for faculty 
and professional staff who are either presenting papers, chairing 
a panel or actively involved in some other capacity at a scholarly 
conference. This supplemental funding source does not preclude 
your applying to already established avenues, i.e., your 
department chair and the dean of the school.  

Funding will take place throughout the year. The maximum amount 
for domestic travel is $150. The maximum amount for international 
travel is $225. To apply, use the state travel requisition form 
available in your department. Submit the requisition to your chair 
and the dean first; then if you are in need of additional funding, 
submit the requisition with a brief explanation of your level of 
participation at the conference to Laura Skandera-Trombley, 7th 
Floor, Raymond Hall. Deadline: Open.

Grant Writing Initiative (GWI)
The Faculty Scholarship and Grants Office announces the second 
round of the 1996-97 Grant Writing Initiative program (GWI). All 
grant proposals submitted (but not necessarily funded) through the 
Faculty Scholarship and Grants Office (excluding continuation and 
fellowship applications) will automatically be eligible.

Awards will be made based on the following considerations:
quality of proposal
match between proposal and sponsor (likelihood of success)
institutional support of proposal.

In May 1997, up to 3 awards of $250 will be awarded for proposals 
submitted during the period 11/1/96 - 4/30/97. The $250 awards can 
be used for future supplies and/or travel expenses in support of 
individual research interests. For more information on any of the 
above programs please call Kathy Chapman at x2537. 

American Philosophical Society - General Research Grant 
Program
Grants are for research only. The Society makes no grants for 
study, salary replacement, travel to conferences, workshops or to 
consult with other scholars, for permanent equipment, or 
assistance with publication or translation. The purpose of the 
program is to put scholars in contact with the objects of their 
research. Proposals may be in all areas of scholarly knowledge 
except those in which support by government or corporate 
enterprise is more appropriate.  

Applicants must be residents of the United States, American 
citizens on the staff of foreign institutions, or foreign 
nationals whose research can only be carried out in the United 
States. Grants are made to individuals; institutions are not 
eligible to apply.

To request application forms please include a self-addressed 
mailing label and the following information:
indication of eligibility for the program
nature of research (e.g. archival, laboratory, fieldwork, etc.)
proposed use of grant funds (travel, purchase or microfilm, 
etc.).

Send inquiries to: American Philosophical Society, 104 South 5th 
Street, Philadelphia, PA 19106. Deadline: March 1, July 1 and 
November 1.

National Science Foundation - Information Science 
Education
The National Science Foundation supports projects that use 
voluntary and life-long learning motivated by intrinsic interests 
such as curiosity, exploration and social interaction to improve 
science education. Informal Science Education projects should 
provide rich and stimulating environments outside formal 
classrooms where individuals of all ages, interests and 
backgrounds can increase their appreciation and understanding of 
science and math. Projects should establish links between informal 
and formal science  education, promote better understanding of 
scientific thinking and increase participants' knowledge of 
science careers. Most projects are designed to reach large 
audiences and have significant regional or national impact. NSF is 
interested in proposals from rural and other less populated areas 
of the country and projects that focus on increasing math and 
science education opportunities for the disadvantaged. Deadline: 
March 1 for required preliminary proposals, June 1 for 
full proposals.

4:00 PM   President Merwin invites you to attend a very important all-campus
          meeting  to follow up on  the issues of campus climate which were

          to attend tomorrow, Tuesday, March 26 at 4:00 p.m. in the Multi-Purpose 
          room of the Barrington Student Union?  At this meeting, we will present
          the recommendations developed by our student leaders, who met on Friday
          to discuss ways in which we can make the campus - and the Potsdam
          community - safer and more welcoming for everyone.

Note to electronic media: "Lough" is pronounced roughly "lokhh."


                              

                              
     The Boys of the Lough, leaders for over 25 years in the

performance of music from the British Isles, are next in the

Community Performance Series with their presentation of "A Celtic

Christmas" on Thursday, November 30, at SUNY Potsdam.

     The concert will be at 7:30 p.m. at Hosmer Hall.

     Tickets cost $12 for general admission, $10 for students and

senior citizens. Children aged 10 and under will be admitted

free.

     The Boys of the Lough have shared the musical heritage of

Ireland, Scotland, Shetland and Northumberland with audiences

from Carnegie Hall to the National Theatre in Bombay, India. With

two Grammy nominations and over 20 recordings, they "remain one

of the finest bands in Celtic traditional music," says The New

York Times.

     Their program will consist of a traditional carol in the

Irish language, Irish carols in English, tunes from the Shetland

Islands, music from the door-to-door visiting traditions of the

"wren boys" in southwestern Ireland, and songs from the "mummers"

of Northern Ireland and England.

     Rick Bunting of The Crane School of Music faculty will

present a pre-concert talk at 6:30 p.m. in Hosmer Hall.

     The members of the band are Aly Bain on folk violin; Cathal

McConnell on flute and whistle; Dave Richardson on mandoline,

cittern, English concertina and button accordion; Christy O'Leary

on uillean pipes, whistle and mouth organ; and John Coakley on

piano, guitar and fiddle.

     Tickets are available at the St. Lawrence University

Bookstore, the Pear Tree in Canton, SUNY Canton Student

Activities Office, Desert Island Music in Potsdam, Northern Music

and Video in Potsdam and Massena, the Barrington Student Union at

SUNY Potsdam, Cheel Information Center at Clarkson University,

the Associated Colleges office at (315) 267-3331 and the CPS box

office at (315) 267-2277.

     The concert is presented by CPS and the Associated Colleges

of the St. Lawrence Valley, with support from SUNY Potsdam's

Student Government Association. The CPS is made possible in part

by public funds from the New York State Council on the Arts.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>            SYRACUSE POINT GUARD SIMS TO SPEAK AT
         SUNY POTSDAM INTERNATIONAL BASKETBALL CAMP
</H3>                              
     In keeping with the tradition of bringing in top-notch

players and coaches to help show young campers the road to

basketball success, the 26th Annual SUNY Potsdam International

Basketball Camp will have its first session highlighted by an

appearance by former Syracuse University point guard Lazarus

Sims.

     Sims will speak at the camp, held at SUNY Potsdam's renowned

Maxcy Hall, on Thursday, June 27. Slots are still open for that

session of the camp, as well as the other two camp sessions.

     Sims led the Orange to the national championship game as a

huge underdog this past April, and Syracuse fell just short to

powerhouse Kentucky.

     Sims knows all about being an underdog, having been listed

by many observers as the biggest question mark coming into the

1995-96 season for the Orange. Considered a weak scorer, he

responded by producing big when the chips were down. Coming into

his senior year, he had never averaged better than 3.0 points a

game, but in his final campaign averaged 6.3 points. In

Syracuse's NCAA Tournament win over Georgia, Sims hit a pair of

clutch 3-pointers to help the Orange rally from a nine-point

deficit.

     Still, Sims' main skill was distributing the ball to the

likes of John Wallace and Otis Hill, which he excelled at. He

finished the year with 281 assists, and average of 7.3 a game, to

rank him sixth in the country. His season total was second-best

in school history.

     The SUNY Potsdam International Basketball Camp is co-

directed by Potsdam head men's and head women's coaches Bill

Mitchell and Joe Vaadi.  Coach Mitchell has directed the past

five years of the camp, and prior to being named as head coach,

served as an assistant camp director and coach to former Bears'

mentor and camp founder Jerry Welsh. All told, Mitchell has been

teaching at the camp for 10 years.

     Fourth-year head coach Vaadi has served on the camp staff

for the past six years and has turned the Lady Bears into a

conference power.

     Coach Welsh, the camp founder, will continue to be an

integral part of the camp he founded 25 years ago.

     Campers will learn from current and past SUNY Potsdam

players who have helped lead the Bears to two national

championships in NCAA Division III. There will also be a slam

dunk contest.

     Boys and girls who will be entering grades 7-13 in September

1996 can attend Session I from June 23 to June 28.  Boys and

girls going into grades 9-13 can attend Session II from July 28

to August 2.  Session III will be for players entering grades 3-8

in September and will be held August 4 to August 9.

     Cost for the camp will be $300.00 for resident campers and

$225.00 for commuters.  A non-refundable deposit of $50.00 is

required to reserve your spot in the camp.  Each student who

attends camp will receive a pair of Reebok basketball shoes.

Discounts will be given to teams that attend together and to camp

alumni who are returning.

     Campers will receive three complete, well-balanced meals

each day Monday through Thursday and one meal on Friday.

Commuters receive a noon meal each day.  There is also a camp

cookout for campers and their families following the awards

ceremony on Friday.

     The camp is held in SUNY Potsdam's beautiful sports

facility, Maxcy Hall.  The complex covers more than 50 acres of

outdoor athletic fields, 20 tennis courts, 6 outdoor basketball

courts, and a track.  Maxcy Hall features six full-sized courts,

an ice rink, a swimming pool, and a field house with an indoor

track.

The unauthorized copying of any software that is licensed or protected by

computer resources can result in their revocation.<P>

Use of resources associated with College computer accounts for direct
financial gain (e.g. commercial consulting) is unethical.<P>

Violation of the Computing Code of Ethics may subject a user to
disciplinary action.<P>

<CENTER>SUNY Potsdam Computing Code of Ethics</CENTER>
<CENTER>(Based upon the Dartmouth College Computing Code of Ethics)</CENTER><P>

Every user of SUNY Potsdam's computing facilities has the fundamental right to privacy and is entitled to a fair share of resources.  It is unethical for any user to violate these principles.<P>

Each usercode and associated password belongs to an individual. All use should be in accordance with SUNY Potsdam policy on computer use set forth in this document.  Owners accept the burden for the responsible use of their usercode.<P>

Electronically-stored files are presumed to be private and confidential unless the owner has explicitly made them available to the public.  Files published on WWW are public.<P>

Use of the network and/or electronic mail facilities for transmitting anonymous, rude, abusive, harassing, or malicious messages is unethical.<P>

The unauthorized copying of any software that is licensed or protected by copyright is theft and thus unethical.

Although SUNY Potsdam's computing systems and network are not invulnerable to deliberate abuse, knowledge of a special password or any weaknesses in the established security systems should not be used to deliberately degrade SUNY Potsdam's computing systems, its network, or personal computers, nor deprive other users of the resources of any SUNY Potsdam- or individually- owned computer.<P>

When necessary for the maintenance of a system or network, SUNY Potsdam Computer Center personnel may restrict availability of shared resources.  It may also be necessary to look at a user's files to follow-up on reported problems.<P>

Computer resources are a privilege, not a right, and they are granted with restrictions and responsibilities for their use. Misuse of College computer resources can result in their revocation.

Use of resources associated with College computer accounts for direct financial gain (e.g. commercial consulting) is unethical.<P>

Violation of the Computing Code of Ethics may subject a user to disciplinary action.
