<title>CINCPACFLT at 55th Pearl Harbor Attack Commemoration</title>



<h2>Remarks as prepared for<br>

Admiral Archie Clemins, USN<br>

Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet<br>

55th Commemoration of the Attack on Pearl Harbor<BR>

USS ARIZONA Memorial, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii<br>

Pearl Harbor, Hawaii (December 7, 1996)<br>

</h2>

<hr>

<em>Unclassified</em>

<hr>

<P>Senators Inouye and Stevens, Consul General Amae, Consul General Kang, State and City officials, Admiral Prueher, flag and general officers, distinguished guests, veterans and friends...

<P>For the past 55 years, Americans have gathered in Pearl Harbor on December 7th  — not only to honor the bravery and the sacrifice of our veterans . . . but also to rededicate our military’s resolve to never again be complaisant and vulnerable.

<P>We all know the story of the attack.  On that Sunday morning in 1941, Pearl Harbor was at rest.  In a matter of minutes, several hundred U.S. aircraft were damaged or destroyed.   Twenty-one ships were sunk, beached, or severely damaged.  In those few minutes over 2,000 Americans lost their lives,

<P>The real story of Pearl Harbor, however, is not in the statistics, but in the story of the American people . . . ordinary people from all parts of the United States and from all different ethnic groups . . . cast into a conflict where boys quickly became men . . . where average Americans quickly became heroes.

<P>Within this audience there many of those heroes.  One of them is Robert Feller, a native of Verona, Wisconsin, who joined the Navy in October of 1940, and was assigned to the wooden-hulled minesweeper, the USS Ogalala.

<P>Just before 8:00 am on December 7th, 1941, Robert Feller was on duty as the ship’s Messenger of the Watch, when he heard airplanes flying overhead. Looking out of a porthole he saw a Japanese plane drop a torpedo in the water and watched it head directly for his ship.

<P>Robert Feller closed his eyes, thinking he was about to die.  Miraculously the torpedo passed directly underneath his ship . . . and instead hit the USS Helena.  Despite the near miss, Robert Feller’s ship did sink during the ensuing explosions, but he was one of lucky ones, one of the survivors. At the end of the war he returned to Wisconsin, worked as an electrician, and raised three sons.

<P>One of those sons . . .  Major Gene Feller, U.S. Air Force, is here with Jim today.  Major Feller, who flies the KC-135’s, fought in Operation Desert Storm, so like his father, he is a veteran who fought for his country . . .  (Stand and recognize)  We salute this father-son team.

<P>Pearl Harbor is also a story of people like Edward Bourucki (Bo-ru-kee), the son of Polish immigrants, the son who left his 35 cent an hour job in Holyoke, Massachusetts for a $21 a month job in the Navy.

<P>Fifty  years ago Edward Bourucki (Bo-ru-kee) was in the Engineering Logroom of the USS Helena, issuing liberty cards to the crew, when the torpedo that passed under the USS Ogalala impacted his ship in the forward engine room and exploded.

<P>Edward Bourucki and his shipmates, through valiant efforts, were able to save their ship. Then, with a patch over the hole blown open by the torpedo, they sailed the Helena for repairs to the shipyard in Mare Island, California.  Edward Bourucki spent the rest of the war aboard a seaplane tender, then returned to Massachusetts where he finished his education, became a high school business teacher, and raised seven sons.  Five of Edward’s sons are here with him today:
Chester — Robert — Walter — Paul — and Peter.

<P>Pearl Harbor is also story of James Green from the State of Michigan.  Jim was so eager to serve in the Navy that he walked for a mile, through a foot of snow, just to catch the bus that would take him to the processing station.  His first assignment was aboard the USS Arizona as a gunners mate.

<P>On the morning of December 7th, 1941, Jim Green was coming off the magazine watch when the attack started.  He headed for his battle station in the forward gun turret, but he never made it.  The ship exploded, and he went into the water.

<P>Despite a painful shrapnel wound in his leg, Jim Green was volunteering within hours of the attack to work as a diver. He continually dove into oil-saturated water to remove ammunition at risk of exploding.  He dove every day for over a year until the last ship left dry-dock.

<P>Jim Green was justifiably proud of his service.  He was proud of the $5 bill he recovered from his locker on the USS Arizona . . . of his picture that appeared in Life Magazine (in 1942) showing him diving and covered with oil . . . and of the Navy-Marine Corps Medal he was awarded for his heroism.
Jim was proud but he was also humble and modest. It wasn’t until several years after he married Irene, “the girl of his dreams,” that he even told her he was a Pearl Harbor veteran.

<P>Jim and Irene Green were happily married for 48 years. They raised a son, James Jr. (who is a police officer) and a daughter, Kristine (who is a nurse).  Jim Green passed away on February 22nd of this year, but his family is here to honor him one last time.

<P>This afternoon Jim’s remains will be interred with his shipmates in the USS Arizona.  Accompanying Irene for this ceremony are not only James and Kristine, but also Jim and Irene’s grandsons, James III and Jonathan.
(Stand and recognize).

<P>My final story is that of Doris Miller from Waco, Texas . . . an African-American . . . a son of share-croppers who enlisted in the Navy as a Mess Attendant in order to help support his family.  “Dorie” Miller was a heavy-set young man who loved recreational boxing and loved serving in the Navy.  He was assigned to the USS West Virginia.

<P>With his love of the Navy, Doris Miller was not prone to disobeying orders but, on the morning of December 7th, 1941, “Dorie” Miller disobeyed two orders.  He ignored the order to save himself and instead, under enemy strafing, carried his wounded Captain to safety as fire consumed the ship.

<P>Later, although standing orders at the time prohibited non-whites from firing weapons, Dorie Miller manned and operated an anti-aircraft battery gun in an effort to save his ship.

<P>For his extraordinary courage and disregard for his own safety Doris Miller was personally awarded the Navy Cross by Admiral Chester W. Nimitz .   He was the first African-American to receive such an award and his distinguished service continued for two more years until his ship, the USS Liscome Bay, was torpedoed and sunk off the Gilbert Islands. Doris Miller was declared missing and presumed dead.

<P>Although he had no descendants, his legacy lives on in other ways.  Earlier this year in Oahu a Navy Family Housing development was opened in memory of Doris Miller.  Through his name we are reminded that heroism and valor transcend racial and ethnic bounds, and that as Americans, our strength lies in our ability to help one another in time of need.

<P>Our strength in unity must be paralleled by a military which is always ready and always prepared.  Shortly after the end of the war, Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz addressed a large crowd in front of the New York City Hall, giving this important admonition...

<P>“We must make certain now and for the future, that the peace is secure.  We must remain strong.  Never again should we risk the threat which weakness invites.  We owe this to the men who have fought and to the youngsters who are growing up today.”

<P>This morning, we salute all Pearl Harbor veterans for their service and their sacrifice, and we renew our commitment to ensure there are no more Pearl Harbors.

<P>It is this legacy of vigilance in America which keeps us in peace and prosperity.  It is this legacy of vigilance which allows us to choose our Navy’s missions, lest others choose them for us.

<P>It is fitting that in the not too distant future, the battleship USS Missouri will be brought here to Pearl Harbor, where it will join the Arizona Memorial to form a monument to the beginning and end of the war in the Pacific.

<P>The war started with the attack on Pearl Harbor and the sinking of the USS Arizona . . .  it ended when the surrender documents were signed on the deck of the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay.  But these two great ships will symbolize more than just the historical bookends of the war . . . more than just the beginning and the end.

<P>The Arizona, with over 900 sons, husbands and fathers still entombed within, symbolizes the tragedy of war, the heavy human toll of being ill-prepared.  As Thomas Jefferson once wrote, “I have seen enough of one war never to wish to see another.”

<P>The Missouri, when she arrives and moors next to the Arizona, will symbolize the triumph of the American fighting spirit;  the spirit which was able to overcome the heavy losses at Pearl Harbor, the spirit which brought victory in the Pacific, and along with that victory, the resolve that our country will always remains prepared.  We have not forgotten the sacrifice of our veterans.

<P>Thank you and God bless you all.

<title>CINCPACFLT at Naval Base Pearl Harbor Change of Command</title>

<h2>Remarks as delivered by<br>
Admiral Archie Clemins<br>
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet<br>
COMNAVBASE Pearl Harbor Change of Command<br>
</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Pearl Harbor, Hawaii (November 15, 1996)</strong>
<hr>
Thank you for your participation in this ceremony and for such kind words about the relationships between the Navy and the Hawaiian Community.  I am smart enough to know that when following an accomplished public speaker, the best advice is to be short.  So, though my admiration is long and enduring for Gordon Holder, his wife Pat, and their daughters Ann and Jennifer, my speech in this cere-mony will be an abbreviated one.<p>

Gordon and Pat became our personal and professional friends over seven years ago during one of our tenures in Yokosuka, Japan.  Even then it was obvious that the Holders were a special, close-knit unit.  They viewed the difficult life of an overseas, deployed family with wit and humor, yet served the Navy and its families with great dedication. Even then it was obvious that Gordon Holder was a leader.<p>

Every commanding officer has a unique style and per-sonal perspective on leadership, but the successful ones have qualities with distinct, historical parallels. Often the winning guidelines are quite simple.  Consider the following sugges-tions:

<ul>
<li>“Get out of the Office and Circulate Among the Troops”</li>
<li>“Persuade rather than Coerce”</li>
<li>“Build strong Alliances”</li>
<li>“Encourage Innovation”</li>
</ul>

Those quotes on leadership philosophy were taken from one of my favorite books, a small volume entitled Lincoln on Leadership by Donald Phillips.  All of those traits describe Gordon Holder’s philosophy of leadership.<p>

Last week, during one of our final meetings, I asked Gordon to identify the accomplishment in which he felt the greatest sense of pride.  Without hesitation, he talked about the Ohana Program and the Navy family. As most of you know, the “Ohana Program” is a widely-praised and highly-emulated system to identify and correct quality of life issues.  On Oahu it brought over 100 delegates together from all parts of the Navy family --- the enlisted, the officers, retired members, family members, civilians, teenagers --- all to-gether for an annual conference.  As a result, over 450 sepa-rate issues were prioritized, a coherent strategy for address-ing quality of life concerns was developed, and families now have an effective feedback tool. The “Ohana Program” is a product of good leadership.<p>

Remember those simple guidelines?
<ul>
<li>“Get out of the Office and Circulate Among the Troops”</li>
<li>“Persuade rather than Coerce”</li>
<li>“Build strong Alliances”</li>
<li>“Encourage Innovation”</li>
</ul>

Gordon was there, among the troops, among the fami-lies. He gently persuaded, built alliances, and encouraged innovations. Many people said it couldn’t be done, but “People who say it can not be done should not interrupt those that are doing it." <p>

Gordon Holder also took action to keep his people bet-ter informed . . . he consolidated the different base publica-tions on Oahu into one award-winning newspaper, he cre-ated a Navy cable TV station, and started a housing newslet-ter to disseminate important information to families in gov-ernment quarters.<p>

“People who say it can not be done should not interrupt those that are doing it." <p>

He worked to make Navy housing better . . . establish-ing the key goals of replacement, revitalization and mainte-nance for over 7,000 Navy Family quarters.  He took his case up the chain of command and to Washington, and he fought for funding to improve our housing on Oahu to its highest level ever.<p>

"People who say it can not be done should not interrupt those that are doing it." <p>

Naval Officers have always been trained as ship drivers, pilots, and engineers; yet, we give our officers little or no training in the role of the Navy’s “Mr. Mayor”.  Naval Bases are major shore establishments.  A successful tour requires discipline, goal oriented action, and major diplomacy. Thus, successes and failures are distinguished by the quality of leadership.<p>

Only a leader could have pulled disjointed major com-manders from different claimants into a quality Executive Steering Committee to address environmental issues, com-munity relations, and quality of life.<p>

Only a leader could have worked to integrate our Navy communities . . .  Gordon Holder tore down fences and opened the Navy housing neighborhoods so they no longer feel like restricted bases, but rather like integral parts of the local community.  He regularly sent ships to the Aloha Tower, opening these ships to the public so that taxpayers could see and experience firsthand the professionalism of our Navy.  And he led the way in the construction of Rain-bow Bay Park . . . a park on Navy land which will be oper-ated by the state, and open to the public.<p>

“People who say it can not be done should not interrupt those that are doing it." <p>

These are only a few of Gordon Holder’s accomplish-ments.  In addition to his role as Commander Naval Base, Pearl Harbor, Gordon also had a parallel job as Com-mander, Surface Group, Mid-Pacific.  Handling two difficult jobs simultaneously is a delicate balancing act.  Gordon was successful because he rose to the challenge.  He used new ideas.  He wasn’t afraid of innovation. He could, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, “think anew and act anew”.<p>

No success story is without a supporting cast.   Gordon would be the first to credit his staff and his family.  He is right to do so.  Pat Holder,  in addition to her role as the First Lady of Naval Base, Pearl Harbor, has also worked hard to improve the quality of life for our Sailors and their families in Hawaii.  She personally led the way in opening the Keiki Childcare Center at Makalapa Clinic, and she built close community ties through her work with the American Red Cross and other organizations. <p>

This is the team to whom we are saying a painful “good-bye”.  In the Navy, the price of success is moving on to greater things . . . Gordon and Pat are moving to Norfolk, Virginia to take command of the Naval Doctrine Command.  I can’t think of a better team for the job.   Our Navy needs their leadership abilities and their innovation while it goes about shaping concepts of how our forces will operate in the 21st century, how to integrate technologies and systems, and how to define our expanding our roles.<p>


Although we’re sad to see Gordon and Pat go, we’re  happy to have such a great replacement:  Rear Admiral William G. Sutton and his wife, Claudia.<p>

Woody took command of COMNAVSURFGRU, MID-PAC about two months ago, so he’s not completely changing jobs . . .  rather, he’s expanding his current job --- actually,  he is doubling his work-load and doubling his responsibili-ties.  However, he brings impeccable credentials of past suc-cesses, and I know he is up to the challenges ahead.<p>

Woody and Claudia. Welcome, once again!<p>

Finally,  congratulations to  all the men, women, and families of COMNAVBASE Pearl Harbor for all your great accomplishments over the past two years.  I’d also like to thank our friends and supporters from the community -- especially Mayor Harris  -- who have joined us here for this special occasion.<p>

You are all a part of our Navy’s success story in the Pacific . . .  and you are all a part of our “ohana”.<p>
</p>Gordon, if you will join me... (award presentation)

<h1>Honolulu Navy League</h1>
<h2>Remarks as prepared for<br>Admiral Archie Clemins, USN<br>
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Honolulu, HI. (Wednesday, November 13, 1996)</strong><br><br>
<hr>
Aloha and Good Afternoon — It is certainly a pleasure
to be here today.  I previously have had the opportunity to
meet with Navy Leagues in San Diego, Guam, Singapore and
Japan, but this is my first time to speak to the Honolulu
Navy League.<br>

Therefore, I think it is appropriate that my first speech
since taking Command of the Pacific Fleet would be to this
particular group — and in this setting — to dedicated Navy
supporters who are meeting to honor our most outstanding
military men and women.<br>

As you know, this awards ceremony recognizes a total
of 68 men and women from the Mid-Pacific area . . . men
and women representing the Navy, the Marine Corps and
the Coast Guard. They range from Seaman to First Class,
and from Ensign to Lieutenant Commander.  They are the
very best of each service.<br>

What brings them here? Why do they serve? Why
would a young man or woman, especially one as outstanding
as today’s awardees, join the armed service in today’s
world?<br>

Actually, their answers would be as varied as their ages
and their backgrounds, and I doubt that you would find any
two explanations that match.  In my own case, I am from the
landlocked state of Illinois, but contrary to what you might
think, I joined the NROTC over 30 years ago, not to see the
ocean, but simply because it was a way to pay my college
tuition — all $300 per semester.  I also specialized in the
submarine service not because of the “Hunt for Red October”,
but because the more time I spent underwater, the less
time I was seasick.<br>

Some in this audience may have joined the military for
a sense of adventure and a desire for that “camaraderie of
the campfire” — a phrase that may sound like an odd one to
use in this day and age, but one which, in the 1800’s, accurately reflected the longings of many new recruits.  Some
things don’t change! The sense of camaraderie among military units still produces a very strong draw.<br>

What has changed over time is the caliber of the recruit.  During the early 1800’s when Lewis and Clark were
recruiting for their Corps of Discovery, that courageous
group who would open the lands west of the Missouri River,
the recruiting order was to “find and engage some good
hunters — stout, healthy, unmarried men, accustomed to the
woods, and capable of bearing bodily fatigue . . . ”<br>

Those recruits could never survive in today’s military.
The group before you today, though they are certainly
healthy, no longer need to be good hunters, accustomed to
the woods.  Moreover, they are not all unmarried, and not
just men.  These men and women are well educated and
technically smart. Most importantly, these men and women
are serving by choice, choosing to wear the uniform and to
serve our nation.  This last point is an important one.  We
could not operate the high technology Navy of today with
two year conscripts.<br>

What is it that makes a young person do this for a living?  I doubt that it’s for the money, or because the lifestyle
is easy or accommodating.  People today can expect to spend
well over half of their careers assigned to ships, deploying
with squadrons or marine expeditionary units, or in arduous
overseas assignments.  This means a lot of time away from
home, away from families, and away from loved ones.<br>

So, once again, why do they serve?  Perhaps because
they have a clear sense of purpose in what they are doing,
and they know they are making a difference.  In March of
this past year, CNN interviewed the USS Independence Battle Group Commander during the period of tensions between China and Taiwan.  When asked “Don’t your people
resent being called upon to do this?” the answer was simple.<br>

“My people don’t ask ‘Why us?’ They ask . . . ‘Who
else?’<br>

Who else, indeed?  Who else could exhibit the character
traits needed in a time of crises . . .  the character traits of
Trust, Honesty and Integrity?  Or, phrased in the words of
Chester Nimitz, the “attributes of loyalty, discipline and devotion to duty.”<br>

More importantly, the group in this room has another
character trait, leadership. Leaders trust others, and are
perceived as consistently fair.  They set goals and are result
oriented.  Most importantly for the future, they encourage
innovation.<br>

Many years ago I was given a small gem of a book entitled Lincoln on Leadership.  In describing true leaders,
Phillips also termed them as “self-starting” and most importantly, as “change-orientated”.<br>

Those of you who attended the CINCPACFLT Change
of Command last week heard one of my favorite quotes from
Abraham Lincoln.  You will hear it many times again, but in
its shortened form it starts with this question:<br>

 “Can we do better?”<br>

And it ends with this statement:<br>

“We must think anew, and act anew”.<br>

The leaders in this room do not need to be reminded of
that quote.  They already know that the best leaders never
stop learning and that it doesn’t matter from whom they
learn.  Admiral Nimitz, in a pamphlet entitled Some
Thoughts to Live By, acknowledge that some of the best help
and advice he’d had came from junior officers and enlisted
men.  He said “I have always made it a practice, therefore,
to listen to anyone, no matter what his rank or rate.”<br>

Nimitz’s statements is true today  . . . true for every
leader in this group.  You can never stop listening, never
stop learning, never stop incorporating new ideas.  Maybe
the name of the Lewis and Clark expeditionary team, the
Corps of Discovery, would be an appropriate one for this
group.  You, as the leaders in your services, are entering into
an unknown future.  You are the new Corps of Discovery.<br>

It will be your attitude that will set the tone for the future. I’d like to relay a story about attitude from one of my
favorite books, “A Second Helping of Chicken Soup for the
Soul”.  Actually, the story is a only a cartoon. It shows a
large wall, divided down the middle into two equal sections.<br>

The side on the right is entitled “Learning Experiences”, the side on the left is entitled “Successes”.  On each
section a women, who appears to be a teacher, has made the
traditional “count-to-the-number-five” hash-marks --- four
short lines up and down, a fifth line drawn diagonally
through the other four.<br>

On the side labeled “Learning Experiences” there are
over 20 such groups of five.  This translates into over 100
separate “learning experiences”.  On the “successes” side,
the teacher is drawing only the 14th mark.  This ratio ---100
trials contrasted with 14 success --- is fairly reflective of the
ratio in the real world.<br>

So, with the odds so heavily favored on the “learning
experiences” side, what will keep us from becoming mired in
problems instead of focused on finding solutions?  It will be
our attitude.<br>

Attitude . . . In the words of Grandma Moses . . . “The
world is what we make it, always was, always will be.”  This
will be the challenge . . . how do we view our world with a
positive attitude?  How can we be, not just the instruments
OF change, but also the catalyst FOR change!<br>

To the members of the Navy league the challenge is just
as valid.  Today, you are providing recognition to these leaders.  In the words off Benjamin Disraeli . . . “The greatest
good you can do for another is not just to share your riches,
but to reveal to him his own.”  A recognition ceremony such
as the one today does just that.  You are providing the forum
for the acknowledgment of achievement.  You are also providing  another vital ingredient . . . community support.<br>

With more than 4800 members, this Honolulu Navy
League is the largest Navy League council in the world.  I
can think of no greater testament to the fact that Hawaii has
a community which is supportive of our sea services.<br>

You, the community of Hawaii, provide a forum where
the military can fulfill its mission.  You support the finest,
most dedicated men and women the military can attract. To
paraphrase Admiral Nimitz, whose legacy began here in
Hawaii, “being a part of the military is honorable, soul-satisfying, and sufficiently remunerative to reward any active young person who loves his or her country and is willing
to accept responsibilities.”  He would have been proud of
this group and this community.<br>
Thank You.<br>

<pre><p>
Senator McCain, thank you for your kind words.  Your presence
here bridges my junior officer days to my present chronically
challenged situation magnificently, and sends a strong optimistic
signal to me that there is success to be had after a full Navy
career.  Admiral Johnson, thanks to you especially for joining
us.  Archie and I know how difficult it is to escape Washington
in a position like yours at times like this, but more
importantly, thanks for making time to visit Adak, Korea, Japan
and Guam enroute here.  That WestPac sweep sent a strong,
positive signal to our 215,000 Sailors and Marines in the region,
as well as our Japanese friends whom I visited Tuesday.  Admiral
Prueher, thanks for flying back from your Washington meetings to
be here with us.  This fleet is ready to support your plans.
CNO, I'm pleased to report to you that Pacific Fleet's readiness
is solid today, and we've handled our drawdown well during the
past 27 months, successfully meeting 10 real world contingencies
in the process, and as I speak 192 ships and 50,000 Sailors and
Marines are deployed in the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and
Persian Gulf showing America's commitment to peace and security
in the vital Pacific theater.<br>
Captain Baucom, thank you for opening Carl Vinson to all of us
today.  Your ship and your crew look great.  I can't think of a
more dramatic setting for the change of command of the Pacific
Fleet and destiny has once again united Carl Vinson and Zlatoper.
Carl Vinson is really special to me.  This magnificent ship is
the same vessel upon which I took my major command when I was the
first senior air wing commander in the U.S. Navy.  There were
many naysayers when we started that program.  Interestingly
enough, both aviators seated behind me followed my pioneering
course, so I guess it's alright to change with yours truly as the
air wing commander.  We flew carrier aircraft in the arctic for
the first time since World War II.  The weather was slightly
different than here.  And...the air crews of the Carl Vinson air
wing also did the flying in the movie "Top Gun"... You'll hear
more of that later.  I made my 1,000th carrier landing right over
there and then i assumed command 27 months ago as the 27th
commander of the  pacific fleet onboard this magnificent vessel.
Perhaps that explains why we have two chaplains on the dais here.
I really owed god on this one.<br>
I have had 33 years to prepare for this particular speech this
morning and the only i thing i can guarantee you all is that I'm
not ready.  So much to say in so little time.  This is a special
place in a special time.  The good news is that all of you are
special friends, so there is no need to tell you about the
importance of the pacific.  In one way or the other you've all
heard one of the 150 missionary of the pacific speeches I have
delivered throughout the world in the last two years.  Therefore,
you'll be spared a political/military/economic lecture.  Just
remember:  the 21st century will be the century of the Pacific,
and you should care about the Pacific, be concerned, and be
thankful for all that your pacific fleet is doing.  So on to my
speech.  I thought perhaps the best thing would be to deliver 3
short speeches instead of one.  One a speech of thanks.  One a
speech of reminiscence and one a speech on personal philosophy...
A soliloquy from the old guy if you will.<br>
First the speech of thanks.  In the past month I already I have
visited as many of the commands, civilian groups, and staff
personnel to whom i owe everything to thank them in person,
therefore my thanks will be selective and few... Just keep in
mind a quarter million thanks I should be offering.  I am an
energetic rational guy, but today I am emotional beyond belief,
and as I have said continually throughout October, there is an
inverse relationship between my eloquence and emotion... Bear
with me.<br>
My mother and father are the two smartest people I have ever
known.  They are my original and continuing heroes.  As my Dad
always counseled me when he took me on boy scout trips, leave the
boy scout camp cleaner than when you found it.  Dad, we've done
that here.  I think PacFleet is better across the board.  Mom,
you always said be pleased with the situation that you find
yourself in, work hard, get an education.  Well with two Ph.D's
and four masters degrees among your three children, I think
you've been successful beyond belief, and I think your comment
that doing the right thing is often times its own greatest reward
has had a high impact on me throughout.  Barry, you'll hear more
about Barry from this podium momentarily.  She has been my soul
mate for 26 years, has been with me through the successes on this
journey and I wouldn't be here without her, in fact I wouldn't
want to be here without her.  All who know us you know that is a
fact.  In most places we go when I'm not in uniform, I'm known as
barry's husband... Knew it was time to go at last week's Navy
Ohana Conference when two wives said the same thing to me and I
was in uniform...  In front row same gorgeous, talented,
energetic woman that I met at a Sunday volleyball match in
Virginia Beach.  She has made this tour a continuing joy.  She
has also been my tempering agent.  Although when I reminded barry
of another naval aviator she had once dated, who had gotten out
to become a potato chip salesman... And I asked her, "see, aren't
you glad you chose me instead of him?"  She quickly replied, "If
I'd chosen him, he'd be the battle group commander and you'd be
selling potato chips."  How true that is... Because I would not
be where I am today without her unwavering support, her guidance
and thoughtful counsel, and her love.<br>
My daughter, Ashley, recently engaged and in the midst of med
school exams is not here, has been a source of pride for all of
her 23 years and my son, Michael, who did come to be here for
this day has proven once again his wisdom.  Mike, your presence
is really special, thanks buddy.  God truly blesses those who
hang around with the chaplains a lot.  What kind of a man is
Michael?  Talk to him later, you'll be impressed.  One anecdote
I'll never forget was that our family wrote to each other through
each of my twelve deployments.  During Desert Storm my son
Michael, then 14 years old, wrote to me every night.  When I was
14, I didn’t even brush my teeth every night!<br>
I would like to acknowledge and thank our numbered fleet
commanders and the type commanders for their great leadership,
energy, a LGgen Jeff Davis Howell, our Fleet Marine Force
Commander; VADM Bob Natter, ComSeventhFlt; VADM Herb Browne,
ComThirdFlt; VADMs Brent Bennitt, ComNavAirPac, Al Krekich,
ComNavSurfPac and RADM Jerry Ellis, ComSubPac.  Along with RADM
John Sigler, the Deputy CINCPACFLT.  You have been a spectacular
team during my time here and teamwork is my favorite word in the
english language.  I sing the praises of all these leaders today.
America, you'll never know how luck you are to have them, but
there is one special event I must mention.  I have had a strong
interest in naval aviation all of my life generally and the
pacific fleet naval aviation specifically during these last two
years.  Our naval aviators are not always appreciated for their
great contributions.  I have tried not to meddle in VADM Brent
Bennitt's work, but I have had a great deal of interest, and he
knows it.  Today I am pleased to announce we are within ten days
of setting a new record for the longest period in the history of
Pacific Fleet naval aviation that we have operated without a
major aircraft accident.  What a great going away gift to the
senior attack pilot in the Navy from the professional PacFleet
naval aviators as an end to a career.  Keep flying safe, one day
at a time!<br>
Our Pacific Fleet ships and aircraft have the very best
supporting cast I have ever seen.  They are led capably by the
rest of our two dozen plus admirals.  I won't introduce them
individually, but thank them when you see them in today's
audience.  These gentlemen are responsible for all the good work
that has to be accomplished and their work has been
spectacular.<br>
Here in Hawaii the fleet staff deserves the credit and as you
know I lead but one component of the Pacific command.  My
colleagues from the Air Force, General John Lorber; Army, General
John Steele; and Coast Guard, RADM Tom Collins, along with LGen
Beak Howell, are partners in much of what we do and here in our
region joint really works.  Joe, you are fortunate to have a team
that works together so well... A truly joint blessing.<br>
To top it all we have the great fortune to be stationed here in
an island paradise, bathed in the spirit of aloha.  Barry and I
have been enriched by our experiences and we will sorely miss all
of the friends we have made here.  We thank you all for welcoming
us into your homes and hearts and we promise to return as often
as circumstances will permit.  One of my primary goals has been
to make our PacFleet personnel, military and civilian, a more
integral part of the local community, and I believe we have
succeeded.<br>
And now, if you will permit me, part two, reminiscences.  I am
trying to remember the first time I stood on the deck of an
aircraft carrier as a naval aviator and I can't, but I will
always remember this, my last, for today is a memorable occasion.
I don't remember my first A-6 flight in 1964, but I do remember
my last... It was Tuesday with VA-196, the last A-6 squadron in
the Navy.  Thanks main battery.<br>
I don't remember my first visit to Japan - yen 360 to one dollar.
I'll never forget my last when I was awarded the Grand Cordon of
the Rising Sun Tuesday, or Korea’s Tong Il Medal in August.<br>
I don't remember my first combat mission, although my log book
says it was April 6th, 1966 against a Viet Cong staging operation
inside Vietnam, but I will definitely remember my last combat
mission on February 17th, 1991 in a KA-6b during Desert Storm, 33
days into the 43 day war when I flew one mission.  I wanted to
fly in a war we won.  53 times ranger played the William Tell
Overture... Every time we launched a major air strike into
Iraq.<br>
I don't remember the first time I was aboard a navy ship when
there was a fire, but I will always remember my last fire at sea
onboard USS Forrestal on July 29th, 1967.  145 sailors were
killed, the Zuni rockets cooked off, it was then I realized the
ability of Sailors to selflessly come together without regard for
their own lives to save their ship and their shipmates... A
selflessness that I have seen every day in the fleet even
today.<br>
And although our Navy has changed considerably since then, that
one thing still remains, the quality of our sailors.  Foreign
dignitaries still accuse me of dressing up our officers in
enlisted uniforms when I take them aboard our ships and
submarines.  And by the way, some of the music you hear today may
seem non-traditional as far as changes of command are concerned,
but these non-traditional renderings are dedicated to the 212
shipmates men who died while serving on ships or in airwings with
me... Ours is truly an exciting, but sometimes cruel profession.
There are some other more mundane things in my career that I
recall today such as desks at which I've sat.  I don't remember
my first desk as a navy officer, a fold out valet onboard USS
Constellation in 1965 to be shared with two other officers, but I
will always remember my last desk, a solid 30 foot square desk
with 8 drawers, two cabinets and ten times the surface area.
It's not the size that I will remember but the fact that it
belonged to Admiral Chester Nimitz during his tour as CINCPACFLT
in World War II... Come visit the mini-museum we've created in
the entrance way... We're working to preserve our past and
traditions even as we move into the era of computers, e-mail, and
VTC's.<br>
Serving as CPF 50 years after Nimitz has been a special honor...
Because I have been able to follow the course of the war in the
pacific as we commemorated each of the major milestones...
Punctuated by the VJ-Day Commemorations here in Pearl Harbor last
August.<br>
This job, this staff, and this fleet are steeped in proud
tradition and history... And i am honored to have been a part of
it.<br>
I also know that the future of the pacific fleet is bright, under
the leadership of a naval officer who knows this region well,
Admiral Archie Clemins... And with the 250,000 great sailors,
marines and civilians of this fleet I know that the Pacific Fleet
will continue to do great things, and will live up to its proud
reputation.<br>
Today, November 7th, as I reflect on my career, it's appropriate
to note that this is also the 79th anniversary of the Bolshevik
Revolution.  I also don't remember my first encounter with the
Russians on active duty... There were simply so many encounters
during the first 20 years of my career... Although I think the
first was escorting a Bear-Delta bomber in the Mediterranean
while I was flying off the carrier USS Kennedy.<br>
But I will always remember my last encounter with the Russians...
In August as I attended the 300th birthday of the Russian Navy in
Vladivostok... As the Russians' honored guest... With VADM Archie
Clemins,... And ships and Admirals from Japan, Korea, and the
Peoples Republic of China.<br>
With USS Blue Ridge in port, and U.S. sailors walking around the
city... And the spirit of a blossoming friendship between two
nations...  I do remember as a grade school child praying for the
conversion of russia... Guess what, it worked... Indeed, the
world's political and military landscape has changed a great deal
in the last 33 years... For the better by any measure.<br>
But the world remains a dangerous place... And many long standing
tensions continue throughout the region.  We must make certain
that our nation maintains its strength, to prevent future cold
wars, and to deter armed conflict.<br>
Indeed our nation, and our world has changed a great deal in the
last 33 years... And so has our navy.  I can't remember my first
battle group work-ups, heck Lt. j.g.'s only wanted to get safely
back aboard the carrier.  But i'm pretty sure it centered around
open-ocean war-at-sea missions.  But on my last battle group work
ups, we practiced NEO, MIO, strike, humanitarian missions... And,
most importantly, we trained jointly.<br>
Today more than ever our nation relies on us to provide real
presence around the world...and our naval forces give us the
presence and flexibility to do that.  Second, our Navy has become
a better organization socially.  During my career we have led the
way in improving race relations, fighting drug and alcohol abuse,
fully integrating women into our ships and aircraft, and treating
all our members with dignity.  Our Navy has faced these problems
head on, and we are a better organization because of it.<br>
In fact, when you look at any objective statistics, we're doing a
better job than our society as a whole, by a large measure.
Third, our Navy has grown to realize that its people, not
hardware, that counts... Thankfully.  There has been a real
paradigm shift in how we think about taking care of people... As
senior Navy and DoD leadership came to understand that people are
a readiness issue.<br>
Have made real actions in improving QOL, in giving people a
louder voice in making decisions, and in providing them the
support and recognition they deserve and need to do their jobs
successfully.  I'm bragging today because I have been a loud
voice, perhaps sometimes too loud a voice for some on occasion,
but nonetheless...<br>
People are our most important resource, and they are what makes
our Navy great.  So much for reminiscences, that brings me to my
third and final presentation... Some personal philosophy.  The
topics I'll touch are attitude, loyalty, teamwork, ego, and my
leadership philosophy.  My best friend, Barry, and my son,
Michael, age 6, introduced me to the first philosopher that I
have really taken seriously, that is Theodore S. Geisel.  You who
have raised children may know him better by his stage writing
name, Dr. Seuss.  In his book Oh The Places You'll Go he provides
advice and rhymes for proceeding in life, weathering fear,
loneliness and confusion and being in charge of your actions.  As
Michael said from the first page...<br><em>
"Congratulations, today is your day, you are off to great places.
You are off and away.  You are on your own and you know what you
know and you are the guy who will decide where to go and will you
succeed, yes you will, indeed 98 3/4 percent guaranteed."</em><br>
Dr. Seuss' book is basically about attitude and the longer I live
the more I realize the impact of attitude on life.  It is more
important than facts, tasks, education, money, circumstances,
failures, successes, or what other people think, say or do.
Attitude will make or break any organization including the
military and the remarkable thing is we have a choice every day
regarding the attitude that will be in place for that day.  We
can't change the past, that is a fact.  We can't change the
inevitable, but I am convinced as VADM Herb Browne heard me say a
lot that while 80 percent of life is showing up, our satisfaction
with life is only 10 percent of what happens to a person and 90
percent on how we react to it.  We are in charge of our
attitudes.<br>
Second is loyalty.  Those who were on this ship 27 months ago for
my assumption of command might recall my pledge of loyalty... to
juniors, seniors, and peers.  It's still vital.  In a book titled
Without Remorse by a naval oriented author named Tom Clancy, the
author talked about loyalty and its importance.  He says, "Either
you keep the faith with your people or you don't.  If you don't
you fall into that habit then you are not worth serving or
protecting and then other people stop helping you, and then you
are in real trouble."  That's true for any successful team and
absolutely essential for a military organization.<br>
My third topic of my philosophy briefing is very simple.  It
involves teamwork and ego.  Fore two years you have endured
messages and letters from me hat shunned the personal pronouns
"I" and "ME".  It made for some grammatically difficult
formulations, but it was a graphic way to show we were working
together.  People working together, the only resource that
matters in our organization.  I hope to be remembered as someone
who cared about his people and who took care of his people with a
positive attitude and great loyalty.  I stayed in the Navy,
although I never intended to, because I had a commanding officer
who said that I was important to him and the Navy.  It struck me
deeply and for the next 32 years of my Navy service I have known
that good people are what's important.<br>
I've studied management including Maslow's Hierarchy, Magruder's
Theory X, Deming's TQM, Covey's 9 Habits, it seems to me that
being successful requires a four part program:  have a goal, make
a plan, work hard and take care of your people.  Life is hard,
and it's not always fair, but life is also fun.  It is much more
a matter of choice than it is a matter of chance.  In fact our
greatest gift lies in our ability to choose.  We are free to
choose our character, we are free to choose our values, we are
free to choose how to treat other people, we are free to choose
how to handle adversity and we are free to choose what we will
accomplish in life, and finally, we are free to choose our
attitudes.<br>
However, freedom is not free.  And protecting it takes hard work
and sacrifice.  To the men and women of the pacific fleet, you
have had my loyalty for the last 2 1/2 years.  I believe we have
worked successfully as a team.  We have been dedicated to each
other and to the mission of the united states navy and we have
prospered because of it.  Hopefully you have been provided an
environment in which to excel free of any form of discrimination
or harassment, we took good care of each other.  A little over
two years ago when I took command of the Pacific Fleet I didn't
think I could be happier or more proud.  When I look back at what
you have all done I can say without question this has been the
crowning achievement of my career.  I could not possibly have
been happier.  As i said, it's only right that I go back to the
great philosopher, Dr. Seuss, and another of his books called
Marvin K. Mooney which suggests in rhymes other ways the young
man Marvin K. Mooney could travel as long as he gets going now.
It ends with...<br><em>
"You can go by bumper boat or jet, I don't care how you go,
just get.  Marvin K. Mooney, I don't care how, Marvin K. Mooney
will you please go now.  I said go and go I meant, the time had
come so Marvin went."</em><br>
And Barry, it's time for us to go too.  What a great ride, what a
great time, what a great day.  Gracias, Arigato, Kamsah Ha
Mneeda, Thanks Mates, thank you all and may God bless you, God
Bless the United States Navy and God Bless America!  I will now
read my orders.<br>

Change of Command</h1>
<h2> Remarks as prepared for<br>
Admiral Archie Clemins, USN<br>
Incoming Commander in Chief,<br>
U.S. Pacific Fleet<br>
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii<br>
07 November 1996<br>
</h2>
<hr>
<em><strong>Unclassified</strong></em>
<hr>
<pre><p>
Senator McCain,  ADM Zlatoper,  ADM Prueher,  ADM Johnson, Honored Guests, Men  
and Women of the Pacific Fleet, Ladies and Gentlemen...<br>
Marilyn and I are particularly happy to have our mothers, Marian Paddick and Earline  
Clemins, and our two children, Becky and Travis, here with us today.  We are also  
honored to see many of our relatives and friends, some dating back to high school and  
college days, as well as many friends from the Western Pacific...some people will use any  
occasion to visit Hawaii!<br>  
My remarks will be appropriately short.<br>  
This past month Marilyn and I were granted a rare gift, the gift of time. We had several  
weeks to transition, not only from one assignment to another, but also from one time zone  
to another, while we drove across much of the continental United States.  Somewhere in  
the state of Montana we chanced to hear a National Public Radio interview with Stephen  
Ambrose, a well-known historian, who had just written a new biography entitled  
Undaunted Courage, the story of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.<br>  
This three year expedition, involving roughly two dozen highly skilled and carefully  
selected men, was commissioned by President Jefferson in 1803.  It was tasked to find a  
trans-continental water route, one which would follow the mighty Missouri to its  
headwaters, then to the mouth of the Columbia River, and thus, eventually to the Pacific  
Ocean.  It was perhaps the most significant exploration ever undertaken.  It was also  
unusual in that Lewis and Clark, both Army Captains, shared their command equally.<br>  
The Lewis & Clark expedition was also a dangerous one.  To achieve success it required  
not only a great deal of luck, but also a team which became (in Ambrose's words) "a  
superbly disciplined family" one with unquestioning trust in themselves and the  
knowledge of the strengths and skills of each individual.<br>
The Lewis and Clark expedition became relevant to Marilyn and me because we followed  
its path through several states.  It is relevant to this occasion, because exactly 191 years  
ago today...in 1805...Lewis and Clark first viewed the Pacific Ocean, the same ocean you  
see beyond this Harbor.<br>  
When they reached the Pacific, Lewis and Clark were only half finished with their journey.  
They still had much more territory to explore, and still had to return to Virginia.<br>  
Unlike Lewis and Clark, Admiral Zlatoper and I cannot share this command.  So, at our  
own halfway point at the Pacific Ocean, he has relinquished his command to me, and will  
return to Virginia.  He has left me superbly skilled and carefully selected men and women  
who are equal to the second half of our task, the exploration that lies ahead.<br>  
Our future journey will be challenging.  Meriwether Lewis viewed his journey with great  
optimism.  We must follow his example.  In all of Lewis's journals there are re-occuring  
themes of adequate preparation, of great joy in the adventure, and of continuing  
innovation.  This latter theme does not belong alone to Captain Meriwether Lewis.  You  
will also find it in one of my favorite passages President Lincoln's annual message  
to Congress in 1862:
<em>  
"Still the question recurs "can we do better?"  The dogmas of the quiet past, are  
inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must  
rise with the occasion.  As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act  
anew."</em><br>
I come to this job with a great sense of gratitude to ADM  Zlatoper and a great awareness  
of the legacy which I am inheriting.  This is the job to which Chester W. Nimitz came  
during World War II.  Marilyn and I will live in his Hawaiian house, the Nimitz House, at  
37 Makalapa.<br>  
Hawaii is in a unique geographical location.  We can look across the Pacific in either  
direction --- either to the East or to the West.  Looking eastward we see continuing  
pressure to "do better" and "think anew" while carrying out the many responsibilities we  
are assigned.  As we look westward, we see the potential explosion of the economic  
growth in Asia.  We see new markets of international trade and the resulting improvement  
in economic prosperity for all.  Asia is on the move, and it is changing -- dramatically,  
quickly...in a way never envisioned by Lewis and Clark. The Pacific Century is at  
hand!<br>  
Our future will be a time of great challenge, just as it was for Lewis and Clark, and it will  
also be a time of bold experimentation, where we must think anew as President Lincoln  
exhorted, while we continue to make the Navy a place where the best and proud serve,  
and we accomplish the mission to the standards of excellence set by ADM Nimitz.<br>  
Thank you very much.<br>

<title>Pacific Fleet Change of Command: Guest Speaker, SEN John McCain</title>
<h2>Remarks as delivered by<br>
Senator John McCain<br>
Guest speaker at the<br>
U.S. Pacific Fleet<br>
Change of Command</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Pearl Harbor, HI. (Thursday, November 7, 1996)</strong>
<hr>
     Thank you.  I am greatly honored to be here today, and to participate in this wonderful ceremony as the men and women of the United States Pacific Fleet officially welcome their new commander, and say farewell and thank you to the man who led you so well for more than two years.<br>

     Admiral Zlatoper and I have known each other for a long time.  We had the honor of serving our country together in difficult circumstances, in trying times.  We flew together in VA-46, and we shared the honor of serving on the USS Forrestal when on a Saturday morning in July in 1967, the men of that magnificent ship were summoned to heroism.<br>

     On that morning, I sat in the cockpit of my A-4 preparing to fly another sortie over North Vietnam.  My parachute rigger, a fine man from Mississippi, wiped off my visor, as he always did, and handed me my helmet.  I started my engine, and a rocket hit the fuel tank under my airplane.  I never saw my friend from Mississippi again.
<br>

     No ship in the United States Navy was better prepared for combat than the Forrestal.  We were all proud to serve on her.  We had just launched 700 sorties against the enemy in four days without a single loss.  We were ready for more.  But we were not ready for the fire that looked to Zap and I and every man serving on the Forrestal to be consuming the entire ship.<br>

     The men of the Forrestal may not have been prepared for that unexpected enemy, but they fought it courageously nonetheless.  They fought it all day, and well into the next.  They fought it with the tenacity usually reserved for hand-to-hand combat.  And they saved the Forrestal.<br>

     Years from now -- hopefully many, many years from now -- when Zap and I are in the Old Sailors Home, we will still remember the lesson of courage and service we learned those many years ago as we watched the crew of the USS Forrestal so bravely answer their summons to heroism.<br>

     Not long after the Forrestal fire, Zap’s and my career paths diverged.  My last mission over Hanoi, regrettably, took a bit longer to complete than scheduled.  Zap kept flying combat missions in an effort to shorten the length of my visit.  As he did so, he exhibited the same professionalism and courage which would distinguish his later service commanding the USS Ranger battle group in the Persian Gulf War.<br>

     Of the many lessons which Vietnam taught me, the one I value most is the realization that although Americans have fought valiantly in many noble causes, we are not assured that the battle will always be necessary or the field well-chosen.  In the end, Americans at war, professional and conscript alike, always find their honor in their answer, if not their summons.  My friend, Admiral Zlatoper found much honor in his answer to his country’s call to arms.<br>

     Years later, in better times, Admiral Zlatoper and I would again work together on behalf of the service we both love.  As a member of Congress, I came to highly value Zap’s frank counsel on issues affecting naval aviation, military budgets, and the drawdown of Naval forces.<br>

     As Chief of Naval Personnel Zap fought to ensure that the Navy’s drawdown wouldn’t force anyone out of a job.  He did it smartly through attrition and selective early retirements, helping America to keep faith with the men and women who served our nation so honorably in the United States Navy.  He also fought for funding for critical quality of life projects like housing, child care and family service centers.<br>

     As Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, he made tough decisions about long ship deployments from homeports and loved ones.  And most importantly, in his determination to improve the quality of life for Navy personnel, he gave much louder voice to the sailors in Navy decisions about issues affecting their well-being.<br>

     The men and women he commanded responded to his superb leadership by performing superbly themselves in places like the Taiwan Straits, the Korean peninsula, and the skies over Iraq.<br>

     Outside of the Admiral’s office, in the entrance foyer, the walls are adorned with photos and mementos of Admiral Nimitz.  There is also a case bearing Admiral Nimitz’ medals and sword.  But most impressive is the battle map which Admiral Nimitz used to chart the movement of naval forces during the Battle of Midway.  You can see that extraordinary commander’s battle notes listed day by day, written in red pencil.<br>

     The uncertainties and ambiguities of the age we live in now stand in stark contrast to the moment in which Admiral Nimitz gathered the ships of his fleet which had survived Pearl Harbor and Coral Sea -- three carriers and a small number of cruisers, destroyers and submarines -- and ordered them to battle against Admiral Yamamoto’s Combined Fleet which in its entirety consisted of eight carriers and 230 other combat ships.  Defeat -- a mathematical probability if not certainty -- would have sacrificed virtually all naval defense of Hawaii and the Pacific coast of the United States.<br>

     What possessed Admiral Nimitz to take what seemed such a desperate gamble by committing his small force against the immense strength of the unbeaten Japanese fleet while Washington counseled caution?  What explains his firm faith in the reliability of the intelligence upon which he based the disposition of his ships and his confidence in the men who would command them in battle?  How did he know that the Americans whom he ordered into harm’s way would obey his orders and reward his trust with such courage and resourcefulness that they would bring their country our greatest naval victory, indeed, one of the greatest naval victories in the history of human conflict?<br>

  	He believed in his men.  He believed in their courage and their ability.  He knew that they, like he, were empowered by the justice of their cause, by a love of America expressed in action, in sacrifice, if not in words.  Trust, derived from his appreciation of his countrymen’s virtues, and his wisdom about how such men would discharge their duties in a desperate battle, was the essence of Admiral Nimitz’ extraordinary leadership. <br>

	Small wonder, then, that Admiral Zlatoper has memorialized Admiral Nimitz so.  Nimitz is the model which every commander should emulate.  By memorializing Nimitz we memorialize the very finest virtues of our blessed and beautiful country, and by so doing provide an occasion to remember not just the greatness of American history, but that the greatness of our destiny rests in the hands of every man and woman blessed to call America their home.  That’s why, Admiral Zlatoper, has taken so seriously his responsibilities to the men and women under his command.  He knew that he and they shared equally in the great honor of defending a great nation.<br>

	Zap, you have served your fleet, your Navy and your nation well.  You will be first to direct all praise to the men and women under your command.  But I know that they would direct it back to you - - the man at the helm. <br>

	I want to thank you and Barry for your many years of exemplary service to America, and bid you not good-bye, but fair winds and following seas for I know we will see you again.  I know you will find new ways to serve the Navy and America, and I will continue to rely for many years to come on your wise counsel.  <br>

	Admiral Clemins and Marilyn: congratulations and welcome.  I am confident that you will both distinguish the noble tradition you inherit today.  I look forward to working with you as you lead this great Fleet toward its always magnificent destiny. <br>

	I would like to close by speaking directly to the men and women of the Pacific Fleet.  You serve your country in a place where my family has been privileged to serve for three generations.  My grandfather was an aviator, my father a submariner.  My father was CINCPAC during the Vietnam War, during dark days for our nation and for him personally.  This Fleet sails in waters where their name is still remembered, and their memory revered.  I hold this Fleet closer to my heart than any human institution that I have ever been a part of save my family.  The Pacific Fleet and the Navy was for many years the only world I knew.  It is still the world I know best and love most.  <br>

	I envy you, your service in this Fleet.  I trust in your willingness and ability to uphold the honor of your Fleet and your country.  For I have seen the best of America here in the Pacific for more years than I care to count.  And I know that the best of America still make their living at sea in defense of their country’s cause.  Make the most of these days for you will never forget the honor of your service in this Fleet nor will your country forget the honor you gave her in seas where so many Americans fought for love of country.  And I thank you for the honor of inviting me to return to a place I love so well.  Thank you.

<h1>Remarks upon presentation of the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun
</h1>
<h2>Remarks as prepared for<br>Admiral R. J. Zlatoper, USN<br>
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Tokyo, Japan (Monday, November 4, 1996)</strong><br><br>
<hr>
I am deeply grateful and most humbled that you have bestowed this award upon me.  <br>

However the real glory goes not to me, but to the people who made it all happen:  the 
Sailors and Marines of the U.S. Pacific Fleet... their counterparts in the Japan Maritime 
Self Defense Force... and the leadership in the Japan Defense Agency and Maritime 
Staff Office.  <br>

And I am especially appreciative of the efforts of  Admiral Natsukawa, who as Chief of 
Staff has sought to continue building the interoperability of our two services.  <br>

The security relationship between Japan and the United States--and especially 
between the U.S. Navy and the JMSDF--is a relationship that is extremely important... 
and it’s making a positive difference in the region.<br>

As I look back on my career in the Navy, I have especially fond memories of Japan... 
from my time as 7th Fleet Chief of Staff in 87-88, to my present role as CINCPACFLT.  
The Japanese people I’ve worked with over the years have been extremely 
professional and very supportive.  But most of all they’ve been warm and friendly.<br>
So as I depart Japan for the last time as CINCPACFLT, these words come to mind: <br>
“Nihon wa watashi no kokoro no furusato desu”.  <br>
Japan will always occupy a very special place in my heart... and I am forever grateful to all of you for making it so.  <br>

Thank you, and I am looking forward to continuing our friendship.<br>

<h1>Third Fleet Change of Command</h1>
<h2> Remarks as prepared for<br>
Admiral R. J. Zlatoper, USN<br>
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet<br>
San Diego, California<br>
25 October 1996<br>
</h2>
<hr>
<em><strong>Unclassified</strong></em>
<hr>
<p><pre>
	Thank you, Connie.  It's truly is a pleasure to be here this
morning.  It's a pleasure because it's a beautiful San Diego
morning, and we're looking out over the skyline of one of the
greatest towns in the world.  Although last time I stood here, it
was raining so hard, I couldn't see that skyline!  It's a
pleasure because we're standing on the deck of our nation's most
modern and ready command ship, the USS Coronado.  It's a pleasure
because we're among friends... friends from the community,
friends from other commands, friends from other branches of the
service, friends from other nations, and friends who have served
before us.  But most of all, it's a pleasure to be here today
because we're honoring one of our nation's premiere fighting
forces--the United States 3rd Fleet.

	Change of command ceremonies always stir a mix of emotions
for all parties involved.  We're sad to see an outstanding
officer depart...  But we're also excited for him as he moves on
to undertake even greater challenges and responsibilities.  We're
anxious about what the new guy will be like... although in this
case I can tell you there's no need to worry.  And at the same
time we're proud of all the great things our command has done.
That's certainly the case today with the 3rd Fleet change of
command... especially the part about having pride in this Fleet's
accomplishments!

	You know, as I was thinking about 3rd Fleet and all that
it's done under Vice Admiral Connie Lautenbacher for the past 26
months, the words "conventional wisdom" came to mind.
Conventional wisdom:  the prevailing school of thought... the
established way things are viewed... the widely accepted
standard.  You've probably seen Newsweek magazine's regular "CW
watch" feature which tracks our nation's conventional wisdom...
Assigning up and down arrows to politicians and celebrities based
on how they've lived up to their reputations.  It's a way we can
quantify the difference between what we expect, and what we
actually get.

	So why do I mention all of this today, as we bid farewell to
Vice Admiral Connie Lautenbacher?    I mention it because Vice
Admiral Connie Lautenbacher has defied the conventional wisdom in
all that he's done over the past two years.  And while he's had
some up-arrows, he's also had some down-arrows...

	For example, conventional wisdom says that Admirals are
supposed to look older and more mature ...   And while people
have often said that I am too young looking to be an Admiral,
even I pale in comparison to Connie Lautenbacher.  In fact, were
I a bartender instead of a Fleet commander, I wouldn't serve him
without first checking his I.D.!

	Conventional wisdom also says that Admirals listen to
mainstream music... like country-western or rock 'n roll.  But
not Connie Lautenbacher... He's a Kingston Trio addict, and has
every album they've ever made.  In fact, at a recent dinner he
hosted, his guests were required to arrive early so they could
drive downtown to Coronado's Sunday concert featuring the
Kingston Trio for pre-dinner cocktails!

	And conventional wisdom says that Admirals drive around in
nice, stately automobiles.  But Connie Lautenbacher drives the
"brown bomber"... a perfect pier car, it only looks better when
it gets accidentally oversprayed!  It's sure to be a real crowd-
pleaser in the Pentagon's mall parking lot!

	So Connie, I'm sorry to say, on the areas of mature looks,
musical taste, and choice of a vehicle, you rate a "down arrow"
from Zap Zlatoper's CW-watch!  But there are also some areas
where you deserve an up arrow... a very big up arrow...

	... Like with what you've done to make 3rd Fleet one of our
nation's premiere fighting forces.

	Conventional wisdom used to say that 3rd Fleet wasn't a real
warfighter...
	... That its mission was solely to train deploying forces...
	... That it didn't need a command ship...
	... That it didn't need to train jointly...
	... And that it didn't need to play a role in building
relationships with other nations.

	Conventional wisdom said that battle groups and amphibious
ready group's didn't need to work together...
	... That C4I was just an abstract concept and not a
practical reality...
	... That the "Pacific Rim" didn't include Latin American
nations.
	... And that you could never bring a Navy from Latin America
into a large Pacific exercise like RIMPAC.

	But as Third Fleet commander, Vice Admiral Conrad
Lautenbacher has not only defied conventional wisdom... he has
left it in the dust!  He has shown that Third Fleet can be a
warfighter... and a very good one... through the success of such
exercises as Tempest Express, where 3rd Fleet controlled 20
ships, 200 aircraft, and 20,000 personnel.  He has made jointness
a way of life at Third Fleet... incorporating Army, Air Force,
special ops, Marine and Coast Guard participation in every
exercise he has conducted, and through the addition of liaison
officers on his staff.

	He has integrated carrier battle groups and amphibious ready
groups to create an innovative new concept of the naval
expeditionary task force.  He has taken C4I from abstract concept
to practical reality... creating what has become the model
communications architecture for the joint command ship of the
future.  He has pioneered the Joint Forces Air Component Command
Afloat concept to support afloat operations during low intensity
conflicts.  He has enhanced our relationship with Latin American
nations, coordinating more than 150 port visits... And leading
the way in training with Mexico, Chile, Peru and Ecuador.  And he
has embraced Latin America as a part of the Pacific Rim...
bringing Chile into RIMPAC '96 exercises with Japan, Korea,
Australia and Canada for the first time ever.

	But most importantly, Connie Lautenbacher has taken care of
his people.  He understands that people are 3rd Fleet's most
important resource... and he's fought to put them first in all
that he has done.  He drove a lot of changes in this command
ship, adding over an acre of office space... But before he did
any of that he ensured that berthing and crew habitability were
upgraded first.  In difficult decisions about operating tempo,
Connie Lautenbacher has always been the first to ask, "how will
this affect the Sailors?"  He truly loves his people... And I can
tell you he has been their advocate in every action he has
undertaken.

	Connie, I know you would be the first to look at all the
successes of 3rd Fleet over the past 26 months and give credit to
the men and women in uniform who made it all happen.  But I also
know that your people give you credit... and they join me in
thanking you for your inspirational leadership.

	In the Navy, the price you pay for doing such a great job is
that you get to move on to bigger, better and more challenging
things... and that's certainly the case with Connie.  He's going
to become Chief of the Navy's Office of Program Assessment in
Washington, D.C. ... an extremely important job in our
increasingly technical Navy.  It's great to see another Pacific
Fleet flag officer moving into a very important and influential
Washington position.  We have certainly seen a trend over the
past few months... With Connie to OPA, Norb Ryan to OLA, and Jim
Ellis to OPNAV N3N5.  We're "Pacifying" the Pentagon!  It just
goes to show how Pacific experience is viewed positively by
senior Navy and DOD leadership.

	Susan, I am especially appreciative of your role in Connie's
successful tour here.  You also have defied conventional
wisdom...
... Creating a training program for CO's spouses,
... Helping raise 22-thousand dollars for a scholarship program,
... And co-hosting numerous visiting dignitaries.
You have also provided Connie with support, counsel and
encouragement... He couldn't have done it without you.

	But today just as we're sad to see Connie and Susan go,
we're also excited about our new 3rd Fleet commander, Vice
Admiral Herb Browne.  Herb has been my Deputy Commander in Chief
for the past 15 months, so I can attest to his abilities.  And I
know he was happy about taking these orders... because it meant
he could be reunited with his wife, Lieutenant Commander Jill
Browne.  Herb and Jill, congratulations to you.  You're
inheriting a first-rate team at Third Fleet with great people and
a vitally important mission.  I know you are up to each and every
challenge ahead.

	Let me close by congratulating all the men, women and
families of Third Fleet for all your great accomplishments over
the past two years.  I'd also like to thank our friends and
supporters from the community and other nations who have joined
us here for this special occasion.

	You are all a part of the Third Fleet success story... and
you are all a part of why our Navy and our great nation continue
to defy conventional wisdom.

	Thank you and God bless you all... Connie, if you will join
me...

<title>Fleet Master Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet Speeches: Oahu Enlisted Navy Birthday Ball</title>
<hr>
<h2>Ohau Enlisted Navy Birthday Ball<br>
Remarks as delivered by<br>
AFCM(AW) George Watson, USN<br>
Fleet Master Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet<br></h2>
<hr>Pearl Harbor, HI, (October 18, 1996)
<hr>
<em><strong>Unclassified</strong></em>
<hr>

<P>Greetings... 

<P>Since the U.S. Navy was established as the Continental Navy on October 13th, 1775, we’ve been on watch... observing  the high points and low moments in our nation’s history... and often helping turn the tide to change a low moment into a high point.

<P>For two-hundred-and-21 years, our Navy has literally helped write history.
Unfortunately, we tend to think of history as a series of days and dates to remember instead of being a series of events involving people, people just like you and me.

<P>When we do remember our history, we usually talk about the leaders, people like Nimitz and Perry, or about battles, like Midway or Manila Bay.

<P>Tonight I want to talk about another group of people who made Navy history.

<P>People like Ruben James, who volunteered to go on a raiding party in Tripoli Harbor during the War with the Barbary Pirates in 1804.  During the raid... to scuttle the captured warship Philadelphia... James was seriously wounded during hand-to-hand combat... wounded severely in both hands, making welding a cutlass next-to impossible.  Despite his wounds, or perhaps because of them, James put himself between an attacking pirate and the commander of that raid, LT Stephen Decatur.   Decatur was uninjured, thanks to James.  Boatswains Mate Ruben James recovered from his wounds and continued to proudly serve  his Navy   for another 32 years.  Ruben James made history...

<P>...just like a Sailor named Dorie Miller.  Miller was a mess steward aboard USS West Virginia on the morning of December 7th, 1941.  When his commanding officer was critically injured during the attack, Miller... who’s battle station had been destroyed in the first minutes of the battle... got his skipper off the bridge and to safety.  Petty Officer Dorie Miller then manned an anti-aircraft gun, even though he’d never been trained to fire an anti-aircraft gun.  Dorie Miller was the first hero of World War Two.
	

<P>In the undeclared war against terrorism, Robert Dean Stetham (STEED-ham) didn’t make a conscious decision to be a hero, or to make history.  Stetham was a Steel Worker Second Class, a SeaBee diver coming back with five other divers from a routine repair job in Greece in the late spring of 1985.  Terrorists took over their flight in Athens, detouring the plane to Beirut.  When authorities didn’t meet the hijackers demands, they killed Petty Officer Stetham... murdered him because he had a U.S. military id-card.  Robert Stetham probably never saw himself a hero, he was just a Sailor.  A Sailor, like Ruben James and Dorie Miller.


<P>We’ve named three ships after Ruben James, one after Robert Stetham.  Dorie Miller’s name graces new housing here in Hawaii.  All three are heroes, all three are part of our history as Sailors, and all three share something with all of us in this room...  <STRONG>Honor, Courage, and Commitment</STRONG>.

<P>Honor has three main characteristics: Honesty, Integrity and Sincerity.

<P>Honesty denotes the presence of character and particularly the absence of deceit or fraud.

<P>Integrity indicates a soundness of moral principle which no power or influence can impair.

<P>Sincerity implies absence of deceit and a strong adherence to truth.

<P>Bravery and Fortitude are the two characteristics that make up courage.

<P>Bravery is characterized by resolute fearlessness and endurance.

<P>Fortitude is strength.  Strength of mind that enables a person to encounter danger or bear pain or adversity.

<P>Commitment, is an agreement or pledge to do something in the present or future.  An action we all experienced when we took our initial enlistment oath, and subsequent re-enlistment oaths .......for us old timers.

<P>I believe the one word that brings the true meaning of this home is  pride .  Pride, is a state or quality of being proud.  You would not be here tonight if you did not possess this quality.  Look around the room and you can see and feel the pride we have for country, service and self.

<P>I don’t think Ruben James ever sat through a Navy Rights and Responsibilities workshop... but I’m sure he understood what our Core Values are all about.  I’m sure he... and Dorie Miller... and Robert Stetham knew that these simple ideas were fundamental to our Navy’s success over its two-hundred-and-21 years of service.  And I think they would be pleased to see us remind ourselves about ideas that are such a part of how we do business, least we take them for granted.

<P><STRONG>Happy Birthday Navy!</STRONG>

<title>CINCPACFLT Remarks at SEVENTHFLT Change of Command</title>
<body background="chalk.jpg">
<IMG SRC="cpf_logo.gif" alt= ""align=right align=middle></hi>
<hr>
<h2>Remarks as prepared for<br>
Admiral R. J. Zlatoper, USN<br>
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet<br>
7th Fleet change of command ceremony<br></h2>
<h3>Aboard USS BLUE RIDGE<br>
Yokosuka, Japan<br>
13 September 1996<br>
</h3>
<hr>
Distinguished guests, friends from the Japanese community,
families, and men and women of the United States Seventh Fleet...
Ohayo gozaimasu, good morning, and welcome.  It’s a pleasure to
come together to honor one outstanding officer as he departs from
a glorious tour... to welcome aboard another excellent officer in
his place... and to celebrate the strong relationship between two
great nations.<br>

This morning I want to tell you about an historic event that took
place 145 years ago today... something which has significance to
all of us sitting here this morning.  It was on this day in 1851
that the USS Susquehana--one of our Navy’s first steam-powered
ships--took on coal in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.<br>

You’re probably saying, “Well that’s great Zap, but we’re at the
7th Fleet change of command in Yokosuka, Japan.  What does that
have to do with us?”<br>

Well for starters, the voyage of the Susquehana vividly
demonstrated the tyranny of distance that still complicates naval
planning 150 years later.  You see, the ship was going from
Norfolk to Hong Kong... on a voyage that would take 8 months,
cover 18,500 miles, and require 8 coaling stops -- in Madeira,
Rio, Cape Town, Mauritius, Zanzibar, Ceylon, and Penang.
Susquehanna’s journey showed that sending ships to far away
locations can be expensive, time-consuming, and logistically
difficult.  And while we’ve drastically improved the speed and
range of our ships over the last century and a half -- and we’ve
built canals to bisect major land masses -- distance still
remains a major complicating factor in all that we do.  For
example, today it takes 16 days for ships based on the U.S. West
coast to transit to the western Pacific... and 32 days to the
gulf!  Which is why it is important to keep naval forces forward
deployed close to where they might be needed...<br>

Which brings me to my second point:  the Susquehana, upon arrival
in Hong Kong, became the first flagship of the newly-formed East
Asia Squadron.  It later changed its name to the Asiatic
Squadron... and is considered to be the precursor for today’s
U.S. 7th Fleet.<br>

The squadron’s ships made regular visits to places like Hong
Kong, Shanghai, Manila and Singapore... much like 7th Fleet units
do today.  And the East Asia Squadron played a key role in
protecting commercial interests, building diplomatic relations
with other nations, and keeping the seas open and free.  When you
think about it, this bears a striking resemblance to today’s 7th
Fleet, whose mission is:  To maintain the regional stability that
is essential to economic prosperity... To build positive
relations with other nations through our cooperative engagement
strategy... And to ensure freedom and open access to this
region’s vital ocean highways.<br>

Seventh Fleet units conduct over 100 exercises each year with 15
different countries, demonstrating our goodwill and commitment to
the region... and they respond in time of need to show our
resolve in promoting peace, just like they did earlier this year
in the waters off Taiwan... and just like they did last year when
tensions flared on the Korean Peninsula.<br>

They also serve as diplomats, conducting staff talks and visits
with government and military leaders throughout the 41 nations in
their area of responsibility... building trust and confidence
throughout the region.  Which brings me back to the USS
Susquehana...<br>

The third reason that the ship’s voyage to East Asia is
significant is because it meant the Susquehana would be able to
carry out an important diplomatic mission a few years later.<br>

That mission was in 1854... under the command of a man named
Perry... to a place called Japan.<br>

When Commodore Matthew Perry rode the Susquehana into this bay
and negotiated the Treaty of Kanagawa with the Edo government,
the course of history in Japan and the U.S. was forever changed.
Little did Commodore Perry know the magnitude to which the
relationship between the United States and Japan would grow a
century and a half later.  Today, with $1.3 trillion in trade
annually between Japan and the United States, we share the
largest trade relationship of any two nations on earth!<br>

Our strong partnership for peace -- in the form of our mutual
security treaty -- has become the linchpin of stability in this
region.  And our Navy-to-Navy relationship is the most
comprehensive of any in the world.  Additionally, Japan has
graciously allowed U.S. naval forces to be based here, including
the 17 ships of the Pacific Fleet’s forward deployed naval force.
These ships are 16 steaming days closer to potential trouble
spots... which enables us to overcome the tyranny of distance I
spoke of earlier.<br>

Cooperative efforts between the U.S. And Japan have helped
resolve regional conflicts, guaranteed freedom of the seas, and
reduced the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
And even more importantly, we have promoted democracy, respect
for human rights, and free markets.  There is little doubt that
ours will continue to be a crucial partnership as we sail into
the unpredictable 21st century.<br>

As I stand here today and look at the United States Seventh
Fleet, and consider all that it has accomplished over the past
two years under Admiral Archie Clemins, I am reminded of
Commodore Perry’s East Asia Squadron.  7th Fleet has enjoyed many
successes... in maintaining stability in this critical part of
the world... in building friendships throughout the region... and
in strengthening our partnership with Japan.  These successes
haven’t just happened... they are the result of hard work and
dedication by all on the 7th Fleet team.<br>

And they are a result of the visionary leadership of Admiral
Archie Clemins.<br>

Through his foresight and untiring commitment to his AOR, Archie
has been the impetus for numerous extraordinary accomplishments.
For the past two years he has reached out to the numerous diverse
nations of this region, and fostered a spirit of friendship
throughout.  He spearheaded the first-ever CARAT series of
exercises with six nations in southeast Asia.  He improved
military-to-military relations with India by reestablishing
Malabar exercises.  He orchestrated the first-ever flagship
visits to such ports as Nagasaki;  Donghae, Korea;  and Port
Klang, Malaysia.  And he planned and executed two highly
successful port visits to the Peoples Republic of China.<br>

Archie has also aggressively worked to bring 7th Fleet into the
information age.  He implemented cutting-edge C4I upgrades for
his staff, flagship and task force commanders.  He developed a
wide area network to build connectivity between 7th Fleet,
CINCPACFLT, USCINCPAC and OPNAV... the first of its kind in the
Navy.  And he was responsible for countless other innovations...
including VTC capabilities on his major afloat units, basic e-
mail capability for all his ships and squadrons, and the Navy’s
first combined tactical and ADP local area network.<br>

But most importantly, Archie has taken care of his people.  He
embarked on an aggressive habitability upgrade to improve quality
of life for the staff and crew on the flagship... and he sought
to ease the strains of high operational tempo on his people by
working to rework deployment rotations.  His people are extremely
important to him... and I can tell you that he has been their
advocate in every decision and recommendation he has made.<br>

Archie, I know that you would be the first to look at all of
these accomplishments, and to give your people the credit.  But I
also know that they give you credit, and they join me in thanking
you for you inspirational leadership.<br>

I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention one particular member of the
7th Fleet team who shares the credit for the accomplishments.
Marilyn, we are all appreciative of your role in Archie’s
successful tour here.  He couldn’t have done it without your
support, counsel and encouragement... and we all thank you for
that.<br>

In the Navy, the reward for success is that you get to move on to
bigger and better things.  And that is certainly the case with
Archie and Marilyn.  Archie will be relieving me in two months as
CINCPACFLT, and I can think of no one better qualified.  In fact,
I recommended that he be the one to relieve me.  I’ve known
Archie for many years... since he was CTF-74 and I was 7th Fleet
chief of staff.  In fact, he relieved me then too!<br>

Though I must admit, this occasion is bittersweet for me.  Bitter
because I know that it means my tenure as CINCPACFLT is drawing
to a close... but sweet because I know that I will be replaced by
such an outstanding officer, a visionary leader, and a true
friend.<br>

This occasion is also sweet because we are getting such an
outstanding replacement as our 7th Fleet commander... Vice
Admiral Robert Natter.  I also met Bob many years ago when he was
Admiral Jeremiah’s executive assistant at CINCPACFLT... and I
have always known he would go places.  He was my head detailer
when I was Chief of Naval Personnel... and I sent him to be Chief
of Legislative Affairs.  At the time he protested because he
wanted a battle group... but I assured him that if he took the
OLA job and did well, he would get a 3rd star and become a Fleet
commander.  Well Bob, this old Admiral was right... and here you
are today!<br>

Bob and Claudia, congratulations and welcome to you both.  You
bring an impeccable record of past successes... and your
leadership and appreciation of this AOR will make you a great 7th
Fleet commander.<br>

This morning, as we stand aboard the modern day equivalent of the
USS Susquehana -- the 7th Fleet command ship, USS Blue Ridge -- I
can’t help but wonder what Commodore Perry would think if we
could somehow bring him here...<br>

He would see how the U.S. Navy’s role in East Asia has
expanded... with the 7th Fleet playing a greater role than ever
in maintaining regional stability.  He would see the strong
relationship that the U.S. enjoys with Japan.  And he would see
all of you... the Sailors, Marines, families and community
members -- both American and Japanese -- who share the credit for
the success of the United States 7th Fleet.<br>

I can’t help but think that he would be proud.<br>

Thank you and God bless you all.  Archie, if you will join me at
the podium...<br>

<h1>COMNAVFORJAPAN<br>Change of Command</h1>
<h2>Remarks as prepared for<br>Admiral R. J. Zlatoper, USN<br>
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Yokosuka, Japan (Wednesday, June 26, 1996)</strong><br><br>
It's a pleasure to join all of you on this beautiful day, to honor one outstanding leader before he steams smartly over the horizon... to welcome another excellent officer in his place... and to revere the strong relationship between Japan and the United States.<br>
<br>
But before I talk about that, I want to share with you about the recent renovation of the lobby at CINCPACFLT headquarters.  We made it into a "mini-museum" portraying America's century and a half of involvement in the Pacific.  The centerpiece of this display is a large mural showing Commodore Matthew Perry's expedition to Japan in 1854.  It's a grand portrait by an American artist showing Perry and his men looking dignified and dressed smartly in their uniforms.<br>
<br>
But prudent historical procedures demand that all perspectives be examined... so we have included next to the mural two renditions of Perry's expedition by a Japanese artist.  It shows a gruff and surly image of Perry, with harsh features and facial hair -- which was considered savage and unsightly to Japanese of the Tokugawa era.  In fact, one account of the time described American's "disgusting fondness for beef and milk, and the simplicity of their religious observance" which consisted of "clasping their hands on every seventh day."<br>
<br>
But by the time Perry's visit was over, the two sides had warmed.  The Japanese presented gifts of lacquerware, silk and porcelain... and Perry gave the Japanese a scaled-down locomotive and telegraph set.  Perry and his delegation also serenaded the Japanese officials with a minstrel show... which made everybody laugh and have fun "to general hilarity."  When Perry rose to depart, a jovial Japanese official "threw his arms about the Commodore's neck, crushing, in his tipsy embrace, a pair of new epaulettes, and repeated with maudlin affection, 'Nippon and America, all the same heart!'"<br>
<br>
I'm reminded of those words today as we're gathered together... "Nippon and America, all the same heart."  150 years after Commodore Perry, our two nations still share a fascination with each other.  We're enamored of each other's cultures... We're studying each other's languages more than ever before... We continue to enjoy learning about one another...  And Japanese -- who formerly detested beef -- are going to McDonald's in droves... While Americans are consuming sushi and tofu in record proportions!<br>
<br>
And we're more economically intertwined than ever before.  I spoke with U.S. business leaders at the American Chamber of Commerce in Tokyo yesterday... and they are truly aware of just how interdependent our two economies are.  With $1.3 trillion in trade annually between Japan and the United States, we share the largest trade relationship of any two nations on earth!  As evidence of the impact that this relationship has on our domestic economy, it's worth noting that well over a million American jobs are directly dependent upon trade and investments in Japan.  No doubt this important economic relationship gives us a shared stake in maintaining a peaceful and stabile environment for conducting business.  Which brings me to my next point...<br>
<br>
One of the strongest parts of the overall positive relationship between Japan and the United States is our bilateral security relationship.  Together, we held tyranny in check throughout half a century of Cold War turmoil... and are prudently staying the course in this new era of post-Cold War uncertainty.  Our efforts to maintain peace and stability have been successful.  We have fostered a secure environment in which this region could undergo awesome economic growth.  Former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Joseph Nye expressed it another way:<br>
<br><em>
"Security is like oxygen:  you do not tend to notice it until you begin to lose it. The American security presence has helped provide this 'oxygen' for east Asian development."</em><br>
<br>
Indeed, our strong partnership for peace -- in the form of our mutual security treaty -- has been the linchpin of stability in this region for over half a century.  But if there is one part of our security relationship that best defines our friendship and partnership, it is without a doubt our Navy-to-Navy relationship.  If you were to line up a JMSDF officer alongside a U.S. Navy officer, the only difference is that the JMSDF officer would have a sakura blossom where the U.S. Navy officer has a star.  We share so many other things:  our education, our training, our tactics, our system of rank and promotion, our staff organization structures... and our values:  love of country, personal honor, and devotion to duty.  These similarities make it easy for us to be interoperable... and that allows for seamless operations with each other, like we just saw last week during RIMPAC '96 -- the largest naval exercise in the Pacific.  We conduct many other bi-lateral exercises each year -- an average of one per week -- as well as staff talks, personnel exchanges, and ship visits to each other's ports.<br>
<br>
Additionally, Japan has graciously allowed U.S. naval forces to be based here, including the 17 ships of the Pacific Fleet's forward deployed naval force.  Having the USS Independence battle group and the USS Belleau Wood amphibious group forward deployed to Japan is a vital part of maintaining U.S. presence in the western Pacific.  These ships are 16 steaming days closer to the Korean peninsula and other potential trouble spots than units based in the continental U.S.<br>
<br>
In fact, when you account for transit time, maintenance and work-ups, one ship forward deployed to Japan equals 3 to 4 ships based in San Diego in terms of presence and crisis response capability!  And through its generous host-nation support, Japan absorbs 70% of the support costs to maintain these important guardians of stability.  That gives the United States the ability to maintain and modernize our naval forces in this part of the world despite a significant reduction in force.  And as I announced yesterday, our newest ship will join the Independence battle group in September:  the Arleigh Burke-class, Aegis guided missile destroyer USS Curtis Wilbur.<br>
<br>
Cooperative efforts between the U.S. and Japan have helped resolve regional conflicts, guaranteed freedom of the seas, and reduced the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  And even more importantly, we have promoted democracy, respect for human rights, and free markets.  There is little doubt in my mind that ours will continue to be a crucial partnership as we sail into the unpredictable 21st century.  This morning's terrible bombing of a U.S. Air Force living compound in Saudi Arabia reminds us just how unpredictable, and potentially dangerous, this world can be.  This is precisely the kind of violence against humanity that the U.S. and Japan work so closely together to prevent and deter in east Asia.<br>
<br>
There are many people who share the credit for the successful relationship the U.S. Navy enjoys with Japan.  A good number of those individuals are here today:<br>
<br><ul>
<li>... Members of the local community who help to make our Sailors and their families feel welcome...
<li>... JMSDF and defense agency officials who help to facilitate continued interaction between our two sea services...
<li>... Members of the staffs from CNFJ, the U.S. Embassy and COMUSJAPAN who help to build our cooperation and interoperability...
<li>... And the Sailors and their family members who serve as informal ambassadors of the United States to our Japanese hosts...
</ul>
But there is one person in particular, on the American side, who has been the guardian of this important relationship for the past two and a half years:  Rear Admiral Jake Tobin.  He has been the U.S. Navy's pre-eminent leader in fostering our continued successful relationship with our most important Asian ally.  He has led a quantum increase in both the quantity and quality of bilateral exercises with the JMSDF... and significantly enhanced our cross-training agreements.<br>
<br>
Jake has been a strong advocate of U.S. naval presence in the western Pacific... Making a clear, cogent case for forward deployed naval forces in Japan.   And, perhaps most importantly, he has been an advocate for the people... the Sailors, Marines, civilians and their families serving in Japan.  He fought on their behalf to keep cost of living allowances at a fair level.  He brought new housing developments such as Ikego to fruition... while working to modernize existing housing.  And he worked to expand and enhance recreational facilities for personnel serving at bases throughout Japan.<br>
<br>
I have come to value his insight and his in-depth knowledge of the issues... and have never questioned his analysis and advice.  Jake Tobin is a naval officer of unquestionable skill, character, strength and leadership... and he has served the Pacific Fleet, his Navy and his nation well:  a total of 36 years in the naval service... 30 of those years on flying duty; nine in command positions.  He is not someone who has sought the spotlight, but rather has worked quietly, diligently, and effectively to do the finest possible work for the Navy, our nation, and our allies.<br>
<br>
In this final leadership position, by helping to maintain and improve the strong partnership between the U.S. Navy and Japan, he has directly contributed to peace and stability in the Far East.  Rear Admiral Jake Tobin has been good for the U.S. Navy, our forward-deployed naval forces, and Japan-U.S. relations.  He can't say it --he's humble -- but I can!<br>
<br>
Jake, I know that you would be the first to point to the people in the audience -- Japanese community leaders, JMSDF leadership -- and to those from your staff standing in ranks... to give them the credit for all of these wonderful accomplishments.  The operators, planners, engineers, attorneys, ASW experts, environmentalists, comptrollers, and other men and women of U.S. Naval Forces Japan are, indeed, a tremendous group of skilled and dedicated professionals.  But I also know that they thank you... and they join me in giving you credit for helping to keep the relationship between the U.S. Navy and Japan just as strong as ever before.<br>
<br>
And I know they join me in thanking Sally for her own, huge contributions.  Not only for her own family ... but the Navy family -- including more than 4,000 hours as a volunteer for Navy and Marine Corps Relief Society.<br>
<br>
We wish Jake and Sally fair winds and following seas as they sail off on a new journey.  I don't just mean that figuratively... I understand that sailing will be a big part of their future as they transition to civilian life!  Hopefully Jake will have plenty of time to remember where his reading glasses are.  I hear that he tends to lose them.  In fact, the JMSDF once even had his glasses flown in from Atsugi when he forgot them there!  I suppose that's another example of the strong relationship between the U.S. Navy and the JMSDF!<br>
<br>
Jake and Sally, thank you for your service.  You will be missed.  I don't bid you "sayonara," but rather "dewa mata"... because I know we'll meet again soon.<br>
<br>
But fortunately we have the #1 draft choice to replace Jake.  In fact, we have somebody whose career is almost a mirror image of Jake Tobin's.  RADM Mike Haskins is also a P-3 pilot... coming to us from command of the Patrol Wing in the Atlantic -- a job which Jake Tobin also held.  An experienced naval officer with 30 years of service to his nation, he brings impeccable credentials of past successes...  and I have every confidence that he will carry on the great work that Jake Tobin has done.<br>
<br>
Mike and Joanne, congratulations and welcome to you.  You're assuming a position of vital importance to our Navy and our nation... I know you are  fully up to each and every challenge ahead.<br>
<br>
Let me close by congratulating all the people here today who are part of the success story between the United States and Japan.  Agreements, memoranda of understanding and treaties are important to our relationship.  But when you really think about it, what makes the partnership between Japan and America even stronger is the human element... and the fact that we can all come together to celebrate our strong friendship.<br>
<br>
A century and a half after Perry's visit to Japan, those words still ring true...<br><br>
..."Nippon and America... All the same heart!"...<br>
... Nippon to Amerika... Kokoro wa onaji!<br>
<br>
Thank you and God bless you all.<br>

<h1>American Chamber of Commerce Japan</h1>
<h2>Remarks as prepared for<br>Admiral R. J. Zlatoper, USN<br>
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Tokyo American Club (Tuesday, June 25, 1996)</strong><br><br>
I appreciate your warm hospitality, and this chance to talk with all of you.<br>
<br>
It's great to be in Tokyo.  Coming from my headquarters in Hawaii, you probably think I'm kidding.  But I'm not, for several reasons:  first, it's great to have this opportunity to meet with such an important group of business leaders in one of the world's economic hubs.  Second, having lived in Yokosuka for two years back in '86- '88, it's great to be back, catch up with old friends, and reminisce on some great times.<br>
<br>
As many of you know, the U.S. Navy's history of involvement in Japan is one that is long and proud.  It goes back to 1854 when Commodore Matthew Perry negotiated the Treaty of Kanagawa, opening relations with the Edo government.<br>
<br>
It's been 22 months since I took command of the Pacific Fleet and since then I have become known in Navy circles as the "Preacher from the West".  That's because I spend much time traveling around the continental U.S. telling Eurocentric Americans why they ought to be thinking more about the Pacific.  It surprises them coming from a guy named "Zlatoper" but I usually convince them that, although their hearts may be in Europe, Africa or Latin America, their wallets are in the Pacific.  I tell them how Asia consumes a third of our nation's exports;  how 3 million American jobs are directly linked to trade and investments in Asia;  how the world's economic and industrial centers of gravity are shifting towards Asia;  and I tell them how U.S. aggregate trade with Asian nations -- 37% -- exceeds that of the European Union and Latin America combined.  In sum, explaining why all Americans should care about the Pacific.<br>
<br>
Expect I'd be preaching to the choir if I were to talk about Pacific Rim economic importance to a group of American business leaders sitting in Tokyo!  But I would like to share three things with you today:  first, some of our current security concerns in the Pacific.  Second, how the U.S. Pacific Fleet, in general, addresses those concerns to promote a secure environment for trade and commerce.  And finally, how our forward deployed naval forces based in Japan specifically fit into the overall equation of maintaining peace and stability in the Pacific.  On that last point, I have some good news to share with you today that affects the force structure of U.S. naval forces here... but I'll get to that later.<br>
<br>
First, consider some of the potential trouble spots in this region... and their potential to impact economic prosperity.  A stunning example occurred earlier this year, when tensions flared up between China and Taiwan.  It was a concern because any sort of instability has the potential to disrupt peace, trade... and the entire region's economic growth and well-being.  Consider this:  even though not a single shot was fired, stock markets in the region plunged, investors scrambled to convert currencies to dollars and gold, and newspaper headlines warned ominously of closed sea lanes, rice hoarding, and instability in a region built on open trade routes and political calm.  It became a concern in the U.S. ... because of our $92 billion in annual trade with China and Taiwan and the fact that 485,000 U.S. jobs are linked to that trade.  One report said that some high tech companies in northern California and elsewhere which rely on Taiwan for manufacturing silicon semiconductors were worried that production could be impeded.  There was talk of a potential silicon crisis -- akin to oil crises caused by past conflicts in the Persian gulf.<br>
<br>
The tension between China and Taiwan is just one of several long-standing animosities in the region.  Other trouble spots include:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>... China and India.
<li>... India and Pakistan two historic rivals whose tensions have erupted in armed conflict three times since 1947.
<li>... Russia and Japan technically still at war since agreement was never reached on northern islands after W.W.II.  In recent weeks have seen news reports of Japanese fishing boats being fired upon by Russians in disputed waters.
<li>... In southwest Asia... Iran and Iraq;
<li>... And the Korean peninsula... where the North spends 25% of its GNP on defense despite a stalled economy and famine.
</ul>
There also is civil strife or insurgencies in more than a dozen countries, from the Philippines and Sri Lanka to Cambodia and Indonesia.  And there is anxiety among many smaller Asian nations who harbor concerns about the long-term ambitions of larger powers in the region like China.<br>
<br>
Then there is the alarming militarization of Iran, and continued threats from Iraq... all in a region that supplies oil for most of the world.  The Gulf War in 1991 tripled the price of oil for four months.  It cost the U.S. $200 billion in GNP, and more than $1 trillion in GNP worldwide.  A cut-off of the oil supply from the Arabian Gulf or to oil trade routes would be devastating to the entire world economy... which explains why we take threats from Saddam Hussein so seriously.<br>
<br>
As populations grow and demand for natural resources increases, expect to see greater potential for conflict over resources.  Competing claims over the Spratly Islands has this potential... China, Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei all claim at least a portion of this oil rich area.<br>
<br>
And then there's Russia.  The current dead heat presidential race reminds us that Russia is at a critical juncture in deciding its future course.  We all hope for positive development, politically and economically, in the former Soviet republics.  The U.S. Pacific Fleet conducted bilateral exercises in Hawaii with the Russian Navy last year.  It was a very positive experience.  But Russia still retains significant military capabilities which must be watched... particularly their submarine program, which is still alive and well.<br>
<br>
In summary, there are plenty of reasons to be concerned about our interests and prospects for peace.  And there's no shortage of military potential when you consider that this region is home to 7 of the 9 largest militaries in the world, the world's 2 largest standing armies and 7 of the 10 most numerous submarine forces.<br>
<br>
Given the U.S.'s growing stake in Asia, and potential threats to our interests and peace, what is the Pacific Fleet doing to protect American interests and promote peace in the Asia-Pacific region?  Our guiding strategy is called cooperative engagement... which means using our naval forces to engage the nations of this region in a positive way.<br>
<br>
In 1995, the Pacific Fleet contributed to this strategy through 125 exercises with 25 nations... Navy-to-Navy talks... Personnel exchanges... 800 port visits to 40 nations... And hundreds of community relations projects.  These activities show our goodwill, build partnerships, and reduce the chances of miscalculation that could result in military confrontation.<br>
<br>
Countries who may not trust their neighbors see the U.S. as an "honest broker"... with no territorial claims or ambitions in the region.  I have traveled to many of these countries and met with leaders... and discovered an overwhelming consensus on this issue:  they want the U.S. to keep its forward presence in the Pacific.  Earlier this year in Singapore, I heard Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defense, Dr. Tan Ke Yam, declare to a room of 1,000 delegates from other Asian nations during the Asia-Pacific Defense Forum:<br>
<br>
<em>"For many years now, the military presence of the U.S. has been and continues to be a factor for stability in the region."</em><br>
<br>
Our presence provides a tangible sign of American commitment and goodwill that is consistent through the ups and downs of trade disputes and other issues.<br>
<br>
In this unpredictable post-Cold War era, naval forces in particular often are the best means for what U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry calls "preventive defense."  Why naval forces?<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>... Because naval forces can operate independently of diplomatic clearances or host country agreements... responding quickly in times of crisis.
<li>... Because they possess the power to project power ashore with carrier based aircraft, or with Marine expeditionary forces from our amphibious ships.
<li>... Because 95% of world's international trade is carried over the seas... and the ability to keep these sea highways open is of vital importance.
<li>... And because naval forces offer diverse and flexible mission capabilities.  Long range bombers are great at projecting power, but they're of little value if you're trying to evacuate an embassy, conduct peacekeeping operations, or carry out a humanitarian mission!
</ul>
But... there's always a but... naval forces are only effective when they're on the scene when they're needed.<br>
<br>
Recent tension between China and Taiwan clearly illustrates the value of our being there in Asian waters, with capable and ready naval forces.  When needed, ships of the USS Independence battle group based right here in Japan -- were only a couple of days away from Taiwan area.  Their readiness became an unmistakable expression of American commitment, communicated world-wide on CNN and other media.  As a precaution, the President underlined our resolve a few days later by ordering a 2nd battle group to the western Pacific, led by the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz.  It added up to powerful signal of U.S. Interest in a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue, reducing the chance of either side making a miscalculation or taking unwise action.  And, according to the USS Independence battle group commander, Rear Admiral Jim Ellis, no one aboard said "why us?"  They said "who else."<br>
<br>
This is at least the 8th time since I  became CINCPACFLT 22 months ago that Pacific Fleet forces have been called upon for real-world operational contingencies.  Others include:<br>
<br><ul>
<li>... Haiti, where we loaned ships to the Atlantic Fleet.
<li>... Iraq, twice, in the falls of '94 and '95.
<li>... Rwanda... where our amphibious forces conducted an evacuation of besieged U.S. embassy personnel.
<li>... Somalia... covering withdrawal of UN forces.
<li>... the Korean peninsula... where naval presence helped deter aggression while tough negotiations concluded a framework to address the north's nuclear program.
<li>... and Bosnia... where Pacific Fleet contributed EA-6B electronic countermeasures aircraft, and Seabees to build bridges, base camps, command posts and other facilities for U.S. Troops.
</ul>
The fact is, Fleet operating tempo is as high now as in any period of the Cold War... but we're doing so with much smaller force.  Five years ago my predecessor had 250 ships and 280,000 Sailors and Marines.  Today I have 194 ships and 215,000 Sailors and Marines.  But the demand for these naval forces has remained constant... or even increased.<br>
<br>
One of the ways we're maintaining our strong presence in the Pacific even after downsizing is through our forward deployed naval forces here in Japan.. which brings me to my third point.  In the 1980's when the U.S. was building towards a 600-ship Navy, our 17 ships based in Japan were important... but today, those 17 ships are absolutely essential.<br>
<br>
With a smaller Fleet, these ships are taking a more active role in maintaining our forward presence in the western Pacific.  They are 16 steaming days closer to potential trouble spots than their counterparts based on the west coast of the U.S.  Tremendous presence is provided by having a carrier battle group and an amphibious ready group 365 days a year right across the Straits of Tsushima from the Korean peninsula and other potential trouble spots.<br>
<br>
If you were to try to duplicate that presence with rotationally deployed ships from the west coast, it would take 3 or 4 times as many ships to equal those based in Japan... allowing for transit times as well as stateside maintenance periods, training and work-ups.  Forces based in Japan also require maintenance and training periods... but, they remain in the region during these phases... still contributing to forward presence in the Pacific.<br>
<br>
Besides reducing the number of ships and aircraft needed to meet Fleet requirements, our Japan-based forces probably are the most cost-effective in the American military inventory.  Japan pays over 70% of the total costs of stationing U.S. forces in Japan.  This amounted to more than 5 billion dollars in 1995.<br>
<br>
Over the years, we also have significantly upgraded and modernized our forward deployed naval forces.  We replaced the aircraft carrier USS Midway with USS Independence... with its larger and more capable airwing.  We stood up the USS Belleau Wood amphibious ready group in Sasebo... giving us a forward deployed amphibious group for the first time since the Vietnam War.  Last year we added two new mine-countermeasures ships in Sasebo to work closely with the JMDSF and Korean Navy in mine warfare training.  We substituted two Aegis cruisers, USS Bunker Hill and USS Mobile Bay for older ships... to keep our technology at the state of the art.<br>
<br>
To quantify the increased capabilities that upgrading our ships has had, consider these numbers:<br>
<br><ul>
<li>-- While the size of the Pacific Fleet has decreased by nearly 30% since 1986, the number of ships forward deployed to Japan, 17, has remained the same.
<li>-- But the total number of aircraft our forward deployed carrier can carry has increased from 75 to 90.
<li>-- The total number of combat-equipped Marines which can be lifted by our amphibious ships has more than doubled:  from 1,500 to over 3,500.
<li>-- And the missile-magazine capacity of our surface combatant ships operating from Yokosuka has nearly doubled:  from 350 in 1986 to more than 600 missiles today.  Ten years ago, those missiles were limited to relatively short-range anti-air and anti-submarine weapons.  Today our ships carry an impressive mix of sophisticated anti-air missiles, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and precision Tomahawk cruise missiles for striking targets hundreds of miles inland.<br>
</ul>
So while the total number of ships has remained the same, the capabilities have increased by an order of magnitude.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, today we are announcing that USS Curtis Wilbur, a new guided missile destroyer currently based in San Diego, will replace the frigate USS McClusky effective this September.  Curtis Wilbur will be our first Arleigh Burke-class destroyer to be forward deployed to Japan.  Equipped with the latest generation of the Aegis combat system.  Also the first surface warship in the world to incorporate low-visibility, or stealth technology.  And it adds 91 more missiles to our forward-based forces.  By the way, Curtis Wilbur will be the first combat ship based here with a fully integrated male-female crew of officers and Sailors.  With one Arabian Gulf deployment to their credit already, this crew already has established a reputation of top performers.<br>
<br>
Curtis Wilbur's arrival this fall will give our forward deployed naval forces in Japan that much more capability... while demonstrating continued U.S. commitment to the security of the Pacific region and defense of Japan.  I hope that many of you will have the opportunity to visit this new ship, as well as others in Yokosuka and Sasebo... and to meet the fine young men and women who take them to sea.  It's awe-inspiring to watch them at work... in the combat centers, computerized propulsion plants, and on the flight deck of USS Independence.  The 18 year olds who launch and recover $25 million helicopters... you wouldn't have trusted with the keys to your car two years ago!<br>
<br>
I hope you will share these messages with your colleagues and contacts in business.  In my view, there is an important, symbiotic relationship between the U.S. Pacific Fleet and the Asian, multinational business community.<br>
<br>
We help to provide a stable environment for trade... what former Assistant Secretary of Defense Joseph Nye called the "oxygen for development."  Furthermore, the strong security relationship between the U.S. and Japan... and our very close military-to-military ties... complement our political, economic and cultural relations.<br>
<br>
You, in turn, contribute to peace by building a shared stake between nations with trade and investments... which makes conflict and its resulting instability unattractive to potential adversaries.<br>
<br>
Together, we're making Asia a more peaceful and prosperous part of the world.  I believe this is a partnership of historic proportion and global importance, as we approach what many say will be the "Century of the Pacific."<br>
<br>
Thank you again for your interest, and for this opportunity to meet with you.  If there is time remaining, I would be happy to take a few questions, to hear your comments.<br>

<h1>Navy League Convention<br>Awards Luncheon</h1>
<h2>Remarks as prepared for<br>Admiral R. J. Zlatoper, USN<br>
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Hilton Hawaiian Village, Waikiki, Hawaii (Thursday, June 20, 1996)</strong><br><br>
Good afternoon and a warm Aloha!  It's wonderful to have so many leaders of the Navy League and friends of the Navy coming together here in Hawaii for this convention.  I would like to congratulate Hugh Mayberry, Dick Fahrenwald, Jim Pitten, Michael Lilly and everyone else involved in making this convention a success. <br>
<br>
Traveling myself as CINC, I have met with Navy League councils from Honolulu and Hilo, Hawaii to Oklahoma City, Cleveland, Dallas, Seattle, Los Angeles, Charlottesville, Virginia, and elsewhere.  Therefore I know, from first-hand experience over many years, that the Navy League provides tremendous support to the Navy and other sea services.<br>
<br>
This is done by telling our story to other Americans, encouraging quality young people to serve, educating the American people about the continuing need for strong sea services and, as we just witnessed, by recognizing and rewarding excellence in our people.<br>
<br>
So... on behalf of the 250,000 Sailors, Marines and civilian employees of the United States Pacific Fleet, thank you for your strong support.  The Hawaiian concept of "ohana" comes to mind.  It literally means "family," but in concept embraces the notion of close spiritual and personal bonds.  The Navy League is part of the Fleet's "ohana," and we're delighted to have you here.<br>
<br>
Of course, it also means I have you as a captive audience here for a few minutes ... and so I'd like to take advantage of this time to share my perspectives on this vast region called the Pacific.  Will offer four observations I've made, based on nearly two years as CINCPACFLT. <br>
<br>
First, after nearly two years, I am more convinced than ever that the Asia-Pacific region is the single most important region in the world to the United States.  Your heart may be in Europe, Africa or Latin America... but your wallet is in the Pacific.<br>
<br>
Rising prosperity in this region over last two decades has had a direct impact on prosperity in U.S.  Nations of Asia-Pacific account for 37% of total U.S. trade... compared with 20% for European nations.  3 million American jobs are directly related to exports and investments in Asia... and that figure is expected to rise to over 6 million within a decade.  These jobs are not low-paying "Mcjobs" of the service sector, but rather pay average 14% above non-export related jobs. <br>
<br>
The Pacific also has political importance to us:  rising global clout of Asian nations... China permanent member of u.n. security council... and Japan may soon be one as well.  And emotional importance:  9 million Americans of Asian-Pacific ancestry... 200,000 American sons and daughters lost to conflict in Pacific give us an emotional stake in its future.  Together, these factors give us... Indeed, all Americans... good reason to care about the Pacific. <br>
<br>
Second, after nearly two years in this job, convinced that we have more reason than ever to be concerned about the region.  Numerous historic animosities:  India-Pakistan, China-Taiwan, Russia-Japan, North Korea-South Korea... to name but a few. <br>
<br>
There is also much civil strife, in countries like the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Cambodia.  And numerous territorial disputes:  Spratly islands (China, Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei);  Takeshima-Tokto (between Japan and South Korea), and Northern Islands (between Japan and Russia). <br>
<br>
Tensions around Asia are particularly concerning when you pause to consider that Asia has:  two largest standing armies in world;  7 of the 9 largest militaries...  and 7 of 10 most numerous submarine forces.  In short, there are plenty of reasons to be concerned, especially when you consider our stake in Asia that I mentioned earlier. <br>
<br>
Third point is that, after the past two years, I feel even more strongly that America's sea services are uniquely-suited and ready to respond to security concerns in the 21st century.  Just look at some of the real world contingencies Pacific Fleet forces have responded to since August 1994:<br>
<br><ul>
<li>Reinforced forces in Arabian Gulf after Saddam Hussein massed his military near the Kuwait border... twice.
<li>Moved additional forces to the northwest Pacific when tensions escalated on the Korean peninsula.
<li>Conducted flawless amphibious withdrawal of U.N. forces from the devastated country of Somalia.
<li>Sent PACFLT units to the Atlantic and European theaters... Ships to restore democracy in Haiti, and even as we speak PACFLT EA-6B's flying over Bosnia.
<li>And most recently, sent USS Independence and USS Nimitz battle groups to waters near Taiwan to show our commitment to a peaceful resolution of tensions.</ul>
Because they operate from the sea -- independent of host-country sensitivities or diplomatic clearances -- naval forces are the ideal means for the U.S. to respond to potential crisis.  But there are even more things we do on a daily basis which contribute just as much to maintaining peace and stability in the Pacific.<br>
<br>
For example, Exercise "Cooperation from the Sea" with the Russian Navy last August -- the first-ever bilateral exercise with Russians in U.S. waters and training areas ashore.  We helped to embrace this former Cold War adversary as a future partner in peace.<br>
<br>
Or what about RIMPAC -- the largest multilateral exercise in Pacific -- bringing together over 30,000 Sailors from six nations right here in Hawaii. <br>
<br>
PACFLT units conduct more than 125 bilateral exercises with over 20 nations each year... And 800+ port visits to foreign nations annually.  We also conduct staff talks, personnel exchanges, community relations projects... all to foster goodwill and build positive relations with other nations that is consistent through the ups and downs of trade disputes and other issues.  I have traveled to many of these nations and met political and military leaders... and I've found that, almost without exception, they support continued robust U.S. presence, particularly of U.S. Navy ships and aircraft. <br>
<br>
But the Pacific Fleet today is considerably smaller than that of only 5 years ago...  196 ships vs. 250 ships... 215,000 USN/USMC vs. 250,000.  Yet our overseas presence is just as high as at anytime during Cold War. <br>
<br>
The good news is we are using remaining resources efficiently and effectively to compensate for the reduction in force, including:<br>
<br><ul>
<li>Outsourcing and civilianizing many functions that used to be done by uniformed personnel.
<li>Increased utilization of our 35,000 reserve personnel. 
<li>Consolidating ship and submarine maintenance facilities where it makes sense.  
<li>Increased reliance on our forward deployed naval forces based in Japan.  
<li>Eliminating rules and requirements that don't make sense.  
<li>And making a renewed commitment to our most important resource:  the men and women who serve.</ul>
That brings me to my fourth and final point:  people really are our most important resource.  Today's awards ceremony showed some of the fantastic men and women who make our Fleet great... And you'll see thousands more tomorrow aboard USS Kitty Hawk for those of you joining me at sea. <br>
<br>
Even the most technologically-advanced ships and aircraft are useless without trained and motivated Sailors to operate and maintain them... and supportive families backing them up.  That's why we've been careful to keep faith with them throughout downsizing... and by making a renewed commitment to quality of life.  Senior Navy and DOD leadership understands that quality of life is a readiness issue, which explains why we've actually put more money into housing, commissaries, MWR, childcare and family service centers. <br>  
<br>
We're also being careful not to let the weight of downsizing fall on our people's shoulders.  We remain committed to controlling deployment lengths and "perstempo".  By the way, we still need about 50,000 of these sharp young people a year to keep our Navy young and upwardly mobile.    As Navy League members and business and community leaders, you are some of the best recruiters he have.  Please help pass the word:  we still are hiring! <br>
<br>
In closing, I would like to remind you that your Navy and Marine Corps accounts for about 5% of the federal budget.  That means it takes 5 cents out of every tax dollar to keep us...  Forward deployed...  Engaged with other nations...  Equipped with the best possible ships and aircraft...  Manned with some of the finest young men and women in our nation...  Protecting vital U.S. interests abroad...  And maintaining peace and stability in a dangerous and unpredictable post-Cold War world.  All in all, I think you will agree that is one of the better-spent nickels from your tax dollar...  And I hope that is the message that you will take back to your communities around our great nation. <br>
<br>
Thank you all, God bless...I look forward to having you aboard Kitty Hawk tomorrow.<br>

<h1>Naval War College<br>Current Strategy Forum</h1>
<h2>Remarks as prepared for<br>Admiral R. J. Zlatoper, USN<br>
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Newport, Rhode Island (Wednesday, June 12, 1996)</strong><br><br>
Good afternoon... Or "aloha", as we say back in Pearl Harbor.  I appreciate the opportunity to come out and share my Pacific perspective with you.  Thanks to Jim Stark, Dr. Wood, and the staff of the Naval War College for hosting this forum again.  This is my 12th trip back to the East Coast since becoming CINCPACFLT... and my 3rd to Newport.<br>
<br>
But these trips to the U.S. Mainland pale in comparison to trips I've taken around the Pacific Fleet area of operations... 17 different countries visited since taking over in August '94!  And some, like Japan, on multiple occasions.  The naval operations and personal relationships shared with countries ranging from Russia to India form the backdrop for my remarks today.<br>
<br>
I'm here to talk about "Current Operations and Factors Conditioning the Use of Naval Power in the Pacific in the 21st Century"... But first, I want you to know that today your Pacific Fleet is in great shape... and to summarize our current operations.<br>
<br>
We have 194 ships and over 1600 aircraft that are operated, maintained and supported by over 250,000 superb Sailors, Marines and civilians... Located all the way from Oklahoma City to the Arabian Gulf.  While our Fleet is 30% smaller than it was in 1989, we have the best people, training and equipment we've ever had.<br>
<br>
Today we have 120 or 62% of those ships at sea.  We have 2 carriers and an amphibious ready group in the "Rim of the Pacific" exercise in the vicinity of Hawaii.  Additionally, another Pacific Fleet amphibious ready group has just entered the Arabian Gulf, and we have port visits in 6 countries throughout the area of operations.<br>
<br>
During my nearly two years in command, the men and women of your Pacific Fleet have worked hard and have served you exceedingly well.  They have participated in at least eight real-world contingencies...<br>
<br><ul>
<li>... Strengthening our presence in the northwest Pacific when nuclear talks with North Korea reached a critical state.
<li>... Deploying to the Caribbean to augment Atlantic Fleet forces in support of operations in Haiti.
<li>... Conducting an emergent evacuation of besieged American diplomats in Rwanda.
<li>... Surging to the Arabian Gulf... twice... to show force when Saddam Hussein made threatening troop movements.
<li>... Conducting a flawless amphibious withdrawal -- the first since the Korean War -- of U.N. Forces from the devastated nation of Somalia.
<li>... Contributing to the mission in Bosnia, with Pacific Fleet EA-6B's, Seabees and other support personnel.
<li>... And strengthening our presence near China and Taiwan earlier this year to show the United States' commitment to a peaceful resolution of their differences.
</ul>
As USS Independence battle group commander RADM Jim Ellis told a reporter from CNN during the China-Taiwan situation when Indy was redirected to the western Pacific, "Our people don't ask 'Why us?'... They ask 'Who else?'"<br>
<br>
The men and women of the Pacific Fleet have also made 1138 port visits to 24 countries in the Pacific Fleet area of responsibility... and have conducted over 200 mutually beneficial exercises with 19 friends and allies throughout the region... sending a strong message of our continued commitment to the leaders throughout the region who fear the U.S. Is withdrawing.<br>
<br>
But there are some warning signs on the horizon.  Budgets are tight this year, and our people are working hard -- in some cases too hard.  And we often see half of our Fleet at sea.<br>
<br>
When you analyze what that number should be given all the constraints including adequate time at home for our people and required maintenance for our equipment, the number averaged over a full year tops out at 45%... Lower than that and you have increased scheduling flexibility;  higher than that and you soon have to stop meeting selected commitments.<br>
<br>
Since 1989 when we started our downsizing, we have seen a steady rise in the average percentage of our Fleet at sea, from 39% to 44% this year... the inevitable result of a smaller Fleet continuing to be in heavy demand throughout our vast area of operations.<br>
<br>
The question today is:  what factors create that demand for naval operations in the Pacific that will shape our Fleet in the next century.  That sounds straightforward enough.  After all, the dawn of the 21st century is only four years away.<br>
<br>
But is it that easy?  After all, a lot can happen in four years!  Take 1990-1994 as an example.  That four year period saw the crumbling of the Warsaw Pact, the reunification of Germany, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the gulf war and coalition defeat of Iraq and a 30-40% reduction in the size of the Navy and our sister services...the largest reductions since World War II.<br>
<br>
So there's risk in predicting how the world, and our nation, will change over the next four years... and into the 21st century.  In fact, a given in predicting our future is certainty that the prediction will be wrong.  The real question is "how close can we get?"<br>
<br>
This difficulty in predicting the future is especially true in the Pacific, where the rate of change is staggering.  Gross domestic product growth in these nations averages 7.3%... compared to 2.2% and 2.6% for U.S. And European Union, respectively.  In fact, only one nation outside of the Asia-Pacific region -- Turkey -- has a rate higher than 6%!  The World Bank has termed this phenomenon the "Asian economic miracle" because it is unprecedented anywhere in world history.<br>
<br>
Rapid economic growth has brought about rapid growth in population as well.  Already accounting for 2/3 of the world's population, Asia will grow by an additional one billion by the year 2020.<br>
<br>
In my visits to countries throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, there are two recurring themes:  the first is an appreciation of the role the U.S. Navy has played over the years in providing the sense of stability so important to economic growth in the region.  And the second is an impending sense or concern as I mentioned earlier of U.S. Navy withdrawal from the region -- fueled by our downsizing and our 1992 departure from Subic Bay in the Philippines.<br>
<br>
As a result, I'm reminded each time I travel of the value placed on our presence by our allies and friends throughout the Pacific Rim and Indian Oceans.  But, of course, that presence is not without cost.  So we have to ask, "What's in it for us?"<br>
<br>
Sometimes it's not as clear back here on the East Coast, but we all must constantly remember that the Asia-Pacific region will be of increasing importance to the United States in the years ahead.<br>
<br>
The region currently accounts for 37% of our nation's two-way foreign trade, more than any other single region in the world.  For comparison, the figure is 22% with Europe.<br>
<br>
3 million American jobs, predicted to rise to 6 million over the next decade, depend directly upon our trade and investments in the region.  Triple that if you want to include the "trickle down" effect.<br>
<br>
Given our stake in Asia and the Pacific, we have every reason to stay engaged in the region... And to be not only interested -- but intrinsically and intimately involved in its future.<br>
<br>
So I would like to look ahead, and consider some of the many uncertainties on the horizon which may generate requirements for U.S. Naval operations.  I believe these uncertainties could easily involve changes as dramatic as the demolition of the Berlin Wall, and as unanticipated as the collapse of the Soviet Union.<br>
<br>
Following an examination of some of the possibilities I'd like to outline for you actions the Pacific Fleet is taking today which will influence how our naval forces operate in this region in the next century.<br>
<br>
First, a major and immediate threat to stability in the Pacific is the outcome of the stalemate on the Korean peninsula.  The U.S. has made real progress on nuclear issues over the last couple years... And the North seems to be cooperating with present inspections.<br>
<br>
But lingering questions remain about the North's leadership, military capabilities, and real intentions.  Of note is the fact that the North continues to spend nearly 25% of its gross national product on its military, despite severe famine and a stalled economy.  More than four decades after the declaration of Korean armistice, the future of the Korean peninsula remains one of the biggest question marks in the Pacific.<br>
<br>
It's quite possible we'll have an outcome within the next few years... for all the indications are that the current situation in the North cannot be sustained.  There are two relevant questions:  One, will the landing be hard or soft?... Or as some are saying, hard or very hard?... And two, what will be the future focus of a united Korean peninsula?<br>
<br>
The very hard landing -- a war on the peninsula -- would certainly be devastating in terms of human suffering and economic impact -- not only in South Korea, but throughout the Pacific because of the interdependent economies.  Even a soft or less hard landing -- collapse of the North and peaceful reunification -- will place a significant drag on the South's economy for a number of years.  As a comparison, just look at what's happening in Germany now.<br>
<br>
A second uncertainty that has become more and more visible in recent months surrounds China's plans and direction.<br>
<br>
The status of Hong Kong under China after reversion just over one year from today is a major part of that uncertainty.  Of specific interest for the Pacific Fleet is the continuance of quality Hong Kong port visits.  Currently 50-60 per year, continuing port visits to Hong Kong will be important for several reasons.<br>
<br>
First, a business-as-usual approach by the U.S. Navy can help provide both a sense of continuity and stability to Hong Kong during this significant change.  Again, to put the United States' stake in this up front, it's worth noting that there are currently more U.S. Businesses and citizens in Hong Kong than British!<br>
<br>
Second, strong Navy-to-Navy relationships are important to be able to transcend political ups-and-downs often experienced in other areas of interest.  Currently we have only 1 to 3 Navy visits to the People's Republic per year.  50-60 visits to a Chinese Hong Kong could facilitate a sense of familiarity and confidence building.<br>
<br>
And finally, Hong Kong has always been a great place for our crews to rest and relax after months of arduous sea duty -- and we'd sure like to see it stay that way.<br>
<br>
Additional large question marks concerning China include:<br>
<br><ul>
<li>... Their relations with their neighbors such as Vietnam, India, and Russia;
<li>... The long term effect of their internal transition of power;
<li>... The ability to raise the standard of living of a huge population;
<li>... And the effect of competition for raw resources in the region as their economy continues to expand rapidly.
</ul>
I believe the Pacific Fleet is well-placed to have a large positive impact as we proceed ahead carefully in this critical bilateral relationship.<br>
<br>
Turning to other issues with uncertain outcomes, we need to examine the possibilities for the Spratly Island chain.  If and when these resources are discovered, we might anticipate increased tension between the six nations with competing claims on the Spratly's.<br>
<br>
Another big question is the political stability, economic recovery and the future direction of Russia -- as a formidable Pacific naval power.  Our very successful visits to Vladivostok over the past three years have revealed an interesting contrast.  On the one hand we see a severely underfunded navy struggling to retain its core competencies, and on the other hand an upbeat spirit in the Russian Far East that ultimately may allow them to share increasingly in the prosperity of the region.<br>
<br>
One area in which the Russian Navy has sustained a commitment, despite its severe financial difficulties, is its submarine force.  While there has been a significant downsizing, the remaining force is at the state of the art and would represent a formidable challenge should we ever confront each other again.  Our Navy-to-Navy relationship is solid -- a relationship we hope will aid in preserving our two nations' goodwill... and Russia's progress as a democratic nation.<br>
<br>
And there are more uncertainties: the ultimate resolution of the long-standing India-Pakistan dispute; the impact or likelihood of the introduction of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction as regional military forces modernize; the question of continued U.S. access to overseas basing and ports; and the potential transmigration of religious fundamentalism into the large moderate Muslim populations in southeast Asia.<br>
<br>
In summary, there are many uncertainties that will affect the future of the Asia-Pacific region.  And any one of them could profoundly impact future requirements for naval forces and Pacific Fleet operations... because of our nation's inextricable economic, political and emotional ties to the Pacific Rim.<br>
<br>
However, as we chart our course through these various uncertainties, there are fortunately a number of enduring realities in the Asia-Pacific region that will help us with our navigation.<br>
<br>
The first certainty is that geography won't change, nor will the physics of time and distance.  The Pacific region will always be immense in size, with over 50% of the earth's surface.<br>
<br>
Major sea lines of communication and strategic straits -- choke points if you will -- will always exist throughout the region:  Malacca, Tsushima and Lomboc, to name but a few.<br>
<br>
The vast majority of commerce in material resources and products will continue to move by sea.  Presently over 95% of U.S. imports and exports travel by ship.  Keeping these vital trade routes open will remain a priority for the U.S. Navy.<br>
<br>
Reliance on our naval forces has been unchanging in our nation's 220 years of independence.  I would contend that naval forces will continue to be in demand and will be uniquely suited to protect American interests and peace throughout the Asia-Pacific region, well into the twenty-first century and beyond.<br>
<br>
That brings me to a second certainty:  the world's economy will remain global, and will be increasingly interdependent.  Accordingly, events and actions in one part of the world almost invariably have global impact...recent examples are legion. Derivatives trading in Singapore brought down Bearing's Bank -- one of Britain's oldest and most respected financial institutions. Flooding along the Yangtze in China last year caused an increase in world food prices, in particular prices for U.S. grain. Increases in the relative value of the Japanese yen has led to a resurgence in automobile manufacturing in Detroit.<br>
<br>
Global interdependency means that instability in one part of the world can do damage elsewhere. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, the price of oil tripled for four months.  It cost the U.S. $200 billion in GNP and more than $1 trillion in GNP worldwide, leading to recessions in industrial nations around the globe. Tensions in the Taiwan strait earlier this year caused a near panic of a potential silicon crisis throughout the world -- particularly in California's silicon valley -- among companies that rely on Taiwan for manufacturing silicon semiconductors and feared production could be impeded.<br>
<br>
In short, global interdependence is a reality and in the 21st century, prosperity in America will continue to be inextricably linked to events overseas.<br>
<br>
A third certainty is the continuing expansion of American interests in Asia.  Economic, political, cultural and security issues in the region will impact our daily lives.  In fact, while your heart may be in the region of your heritage -- whether that be Europe, Asia, Africa or Latin America -- your wallet will increasingly be in the Pacific.<br>
<br>
First and foremost among our interests then is our economic stake in Asia.  3 million jobs (as I said before) are dependent upon this region which consumes a third of our exports... and will consume half of our exports by the year 2020.<br>
<br>
Politically, nations throughout the region are taking on greater positions of world leadership.  China is a permanent member of U.N. Security Council... and there is much discussion about Japan also taking a seat.  ASEAN countries are gaining clout throughout the world on a level akin to European Union and OPEC.  Indonesia, for example, with the worlds 4th largest population and the largest moderate Islamic population -- while increasingly friendly to the U.S. -- continues to be a leader of the non-aligned countries.<br>
<br>
Our interests are economic, political... And cultural.  With over 9 million Americans of Asian ancestry, the hearts of more and more Americans are in the Pacific.<br>
<br>
So with strong economic, political, cultural and even emotional ties to the Pacific, it follows that we have robust and continuing security interests there as well.<br>
<br>
A fourth certainty is that there will continue in the twenty-first century to be different -- and in some cases divergent -- cultural and social values among nations in the region.<br>
<br>
In some countries, for example, there are differing priorities placed on group values versus individual desires, which leads to differing interpretations over some basic issues like human rights, freedom of speech and religion, and intellectual property rights... to name a few of current interest.<br>
<br>
While the U.S. will continue to emphasize the values in which we so strongly believe, we need to recognize Asian perceptions and the potential for reduced U.S. influence caused by them.  Military-to-military contact in general -- and Navy contact in particular -- pays triple dividends in that respect. Positive professional and personal contact builds confidence and can reverse many negative images. Solid military contacts, delinked from political and economic issues, can provide an anchor during otherwise stormy seas in our bilateral relations. And finally, the vision of tremendously professional men and women equipped with formidable weapons systems can indelibly impact those who might think about becoming adversaries.<br>
<br>
With the reversion of Hong Kong in '97 and Macao in '99, the end of over two centuries of Western settlement in Asia is at hand.  While the resulting emergent sense of independence from Western influence can present challenges for economic and military presence, the United States and particularly U.S. naval forces are viewed as honest brokers... and our presence is viewed as a stabilizing influence.<br>
<br>
Our role as honest broker is enhanced by the U.S. Pacific Command's policy of "places, not bases", meaning that we would like to have continuing access to nations throughout the region for visits and mutually beneficial exercises... but we don't intend to establish new bases of the magnitude of a Subic Bay, for example.<br>
<br>
A fifth reality for naval forces as we enter the next decade is that there will be an increasing and necessary interest worldwide in the protection of our environment, both ashore and throughout our vast oceans.<br>
<br>
The U.S. Navy and the Pacific Fleet have taken a lead in this area... And some of our many environmental programs have become the model for others.  At the same time, we've got to balance our operational requirements and freedom of the seas with our environmental responsibilities.<br>
<br>
For example, low frequency analysis, which uses a very high energy sonar pulse to detect underwater objects, promises significant advances in our ability to find diesel submarines in the littorals.  However its impact on marine mammals is not fully understood... so we have worked closely with civilian researchers to ensure there is no harm.<br>
<br>
As a positive by-product these researchers have had access to sophisticated equipment and advanced data unaffordable and unobtainable by them in the past.<br>
<br>
A related concern among some nations in our region is the impact of the presence of nuclear powered warships.  Fortunately, the U.S. Navy's nuclear power safety record is such that, even with the establishment of various "nuclear free zones", our legal access to the high seas -- as well as our right of innocent passage through territorial waters -- has not been challenged.<br>
<br>
A sixth factor that will influence our operations in the Asia-Pacific region for years to come is the desire for most Asian nations to engage in bilateral vice multilateral military-to-military exercises and operations.<br>
<br>
There is no overarching security umbrella in the region similar to NATO, and for numerous social and economic reasons it appears unlikely that we will see movement toward such an organization in the future.<br>
<br>
We have encouraged more multilateral interaction at a pace acceptable to each nation, and have had some success with very carefully crafted multilateral exercises.  One of our more visible successes is a large maritime exercise now ongoing called the "Rim of the Pacific" or "RIMPAC", which has brought together the navies of six nations, along with observers from four others, in Hawaiian waters for about a month.<br>
<br>
But even in this exercise some navies cannot or will not operate with one another and the scenario has to be scripted accordingly.  In short, the progress toward multilateral contact -- and the operational efficiencies that accrue from multilateral contact --  remains slow.<br>
<br>
Our long-term goal is -- through even-handed honest brokering -- to build mutual confidence throughout the region, which brings me to a final factor in the Asia-Pacific Rim that is of great concern to us...<br>
<br>
And that is, that Asia has become the most well-armed corner of the globe, and the pace continues unabated.  The region already accounts for 7 of the 8 largest, militaries in the world, the world's two largest standing armies and 7 of 10 largest submarine forces in the world.<br>
<br>
And it continues to grow... the London Financial Times reported recently that:<br>
<br><em> "In marked contrast to declines elsewhere in the world, defense spending in Pacific Rim countries is rising rapidly."</em><br>
<br>
While U.S. And other nations have decreased military spending, military spending since 1992 has increased in real terms by 9% in East Asia, and 6% in South Asia.  Many smaller nations are increasing their drive for newer and more advanced weaponry... while arms sales is a huge and rapidly expanding market.<br>
<br>
China, with nearly 3 million men in its military, is spending twice the percentage of its GNP on defense as we... and is driving towards a blue-water Navy.  Even nations that don't increase military spending as a percentage of GNP will continue to have rapidly growing military power simply because their GNP itself is growing so rapidly.<br>
<br>
We must keep this in mind lest we become complacent.  Although U.S. is the uncontested strongest naval power in the region and in the world today, we are likely to be challenged by the latest smart weaponry, including sea-skimming missiles and information warfare against our information systems -- as well as cheaper but deadly conventional weapons like mines -- in the hands of more and more countries.<br>
<br>
It's important to bear these certainties and trends in mind as we approach the 21st century, where defense in the Pacific will become increasingly complicated.  Defense Secretary William Perry in his recent speech at Harvard's John Kennedy School outlined a policy of "Preventive Defense", saying:<br>
<br><em> "The United States has a unique historical opportunity, the opportunity to prevent the conditions for conflict and to help create the conditions for peace."</em><br>
<br>
This new strategy makes "Preventive Defense" our first line of defense... deterrence the second line of defense... and military conflict the third and last resort.  What makes Preventive Defense work is American leadership, and our ability to have a global presence.<br>
<br>
We execute Preventive Defense and the Pacific Command's strategy of Cooperative Engagement by conducting over 125 exercises annually... 800 port visits... numerous Navy staff talks... and community relations projects.  These actions foster goodwill, increase transparency, and reduce the chances of miscalculation that could result in conflict.<br>
<br>
In the Pacific, we are taking several actions to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet in its position of continued leadership and forward presence in this vibrant region well into the 21st century.<br>
<br>
Your Pacific Fleet is staying engaged in maritime issues... As countries seek to gain more control of their surrounding waterways by seeking legal means to increase their territorial sea claims, and control of archipelagic waterways.  We are influencing decisions wherever possible, and maintaining a robust freedom of navigation operations program to challenge unreasonable and legally insupportable territorial assertions that might constrain our unfettered access to critical sea lanes.<br>
<br>
Your Pacific Fleet is fully utilizing Fleet resources to make the most of the smaller overall size of the Fleet.  Reserve forces in particular are playing a major role in that, through "contributory support" by reserve personnel, and by deploying naval reserve force ships.<br>
<br>
In fact, even as we speak two reserve frigates, USS George Philip and USS Mahlon S. Tisdale, are conducting a bilateral exercise series in Southeast Asia, freeing up active force ships for other contingency commitments.<br>
<br>
Your Pacific Fleet is refocusing on "places not bases", the Pacific Command strategy I mentioned earlier for limited logistical support from nations throughout the region.  Singapore, home of COMLOGWESTPAC and a small Fleet support contingent is a good example of this theme.<br>
<br>
And your Pacific Fleet is doing things smarter in a variety of ways... from reorganizing and streamlining chains of command... to outsourcing and civilianizing.  And we continue to draw upon the intellect and innovation of our own men and women in the Navy.<br>
<br>
Our challenge is to combine these approaches and known quantities with the range of potential possibilities -- the uncertainties -- in a meaningful way... not to predict the future, but to gain good insight into it.<br>
<br>
Our goal is to leverage the right kind of available technology so that we can keep the Pacific Fleet affordable, modern, flexible... and most importantly relevant, by being there to continue to influence events positively throughout Asia and the Pacific Rim.<br>
<br>
Thank you and God bless you all.<br>

<h1>COMNAVSURFPAC<br>Change of Command</h1>
<h2>Remarks as prepared for<br>Admiral R. J. Zlatoper, USN<br>
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet</h2>
<hr>
<strong>On Board USS ESSEX, San Diego, Calif. (Friday, April 19, 1996)</strong><br><br>
Vice Admiral Robinson, Vice Admiral Krekich, crewmembers of USS Essex... Surface Warriors of SURFPAC... Family and friends.  The weather is better than the last change of command speech I gave in San Diego.  That's good news and bad news.  The bad news is I'll talk longer!<br>
<br>
I am delighted to join you today to participate in this important change of command ceremony... and to help pipe an officer, a shipmate and respected friend over the side after 33 years of dedicated service to our nation.<br>
<br>
Change of command ceremonies always stir a mix of emotions... but they especially do so when the outgoing commander is transitioning to civilian life.  Each of us shares the pride Dave and Gene and their family feel as they prepare to weigh anchor and steam smartly over the horizon to take on new challenges and enjoy continuing successes in the civilian world.  We also feel sadness as one of our Navy families leaves... and we know we will miss them.  Ceremonies such as this remind us all, people are indeed the single greatest attribute, and the absolute measure of strength in any organization.  People can be relieved, but they can never be replaced.<br>
<br>
Dave Robinson took his commission 33 years ago in 1963 from the U.S. Naval Academy.  As I was thinking about saying farewell to Dave, I was reflecting on how much the Navy... and the world... has changed since then.<br>
<br>
As an example, did you know that in 1963 the pay for a newly commissioned Ensign was $314 per month.  Today, with housing allowances, a newly commissioned Ensign stationed here in San Diego makes nearly $2400 a month.  We have made some improvements!  And all these years there is a heavy rumor that Gene has kept Dave on the same allowance as he made as an Ensign in 1963!<br>
<br>
Also, did you know that 33 years ago, there was no SURFPAC... Our surface force was broken into three separate force entities: amphibious (PHIBPAC), cruiser-destroyer (CRUDESPAC) and service (SERVPAC).  Today, there is one unifying force who oversees all of that and more... And he does a great job of it!<br>
<br>
Did you know that in 1963, Betty Friedan's famous book Feminine Mystique was published... launching the feminist movement for the rest of America.  And at that time we already had nearly 13,000 women serving for the same wages as their male counterparts.  Today, we have women aboard every class of surface ship in our Fleet, and flying fighter aircraft off the decks of carriers... like the USS Nimitz that arrived on scene for the China/Taiwan confrontation last month.<br>
<br>
And did you recall that in 1963, Martin Luther King stood on the Mall in Washington D.C. and gave his "I have a dream" speech... when a man by the name of Colin Powell was serving as a young Army Captain.  Thirty years later our military's highest ranking officer was a black man... who today is mentioned prominently as a candidate for national office.<br>
<br>
And you recall that 33 years ago, a Belknap class cruiser cost about $130 million to build? Today, an Aegis cruiser costs over one billion dollars.<br>
<br>
And 33 years ago, Japan's annual exports totaled just over $10 billion.  Today, Japan exports over $400 billion of goods each year... a 4000% increase.<br>
<br>
33 years ago, our space program was trying to play catch up with the Soviet Union... and hoping to reach the moon.  Today, our astronauts are in space together with their Russian counterparts... and we're reaching towards Mars.<br>
<br>
33 years ago as a newly commissioned Ensign, Dave Robinson was at destroyer school, learning how to fight a potential war with the Soviets.  Today, SURFPAC ships participate in bilateral exercises and goodwill port visits with Russian ships on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
While much has indeed changed over the years, much remains the same.  Take for example the following quote:<em> "Americans must look outward.  Sea commerce has a profound influence upon the wealth and strength of countries... and governs its growth and prosperity."</em><br>
<br>
Those words weren't spoken last week by someone like John Naisbitt, Alan Greenspan or Mickey Kantor... but over 100 years ago by Alfred Thayer Mahan, another Surface Warrior of some renown.  100 years later, America still depends on the sea in both peace and war.<br>
<br>
In peace we depend on it being free and open to all to sustain our standard of living... with over 95% of U.S. import and export trade being transported by the sea.  This is specially true in the Pacific and Asia, a vibrant region where trade and investments directly support over 3 million American jobs.<br>
<br>
In war, our success depends on our often demonstrated ability to control the seas at will.  These two requirements haven't changed one bit in 220 years of independence.<br>
<br>
But yes, much has changed in Dave Robinson's Navy over the past 33 years.  Much has also changed in the world at large.  In fact, much of the positive change which has occurred in our world and in our Navy over the last three decades is the direct result of the efforts of leaders like Dave.  They have made important contributions in the defense of their nation and of freedom loving peoples around the world.<br>
<br>
Engraved deep in stone over our National Archives, the building in Washington which houses our most precious documents, like the Declaration of Independence, is an admonition which every American should know by heart. It reads:<em> "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty."</em>
<br>
Dave has been vigilant, ever on guard.  He and the many like him won the Cold War, held tyranny in check in Vietnam and then in Desert Storm, and set the stage for a more promising tomorrow.<br>
<br>
When we look at a man or woman who has spent their adult lives in the Navy, some might ask "why?".  What is it which makes a person do this for a living?  In answering these questions, there are some notions which cannot be immediately dismissed.<br>
<br>
First, people don't serve in the armed services for the money.  (though, granted, Dave does make a little more now than the $314 a month he earned in 1963!).  But good people, who are willing to work hard, who have ambition, can generally earn a good deal more on the outside.  And although military pay has become quite competitive with the civilian sector, that's still not why people do it.<br>
<br>
Second, people don't spend their lives in the Navy because it's an easy, accommodating lifestyle.  The Dave Robinson's of the Navy can expect to spend well over half their careers assigned to ships, deploying with squadrons or staffs, or in arduous overseas assignments.  This means spending a lot of time away from home, away from families and loved ones.  No, people don't serve because it's an easy life.<br>
<br>
And third, people don't spend a career in the Navy because it's risk free.  Operating ships, submarines and aircraft... and working on flight decks just like this one, where blades are spinning and the ship is pitching and rolling... can be dangerous.  Furthermore, sometimes we are called on to sail into harms way to protect our nation's freedom and the rights of our friends and allies.  The Purple Heart you see on Dave's chest is testimony to the fact that the Navy has its risks... and is not a life for the weak at heart.<br>
<br>
So why do they serve?  They serve because they have a clear sense of purpose in what they are doing... And they know they are making a difference.   Just think of some of the important things SURFPAC units have done over the last three years:<br>
<br><ul>
<li>... They responded to the China-Taiwan crisis last month.
<li>... They completed the successful withdrawal of U.N. personnel from the devastated nation of Somalia (in which USS Essex participated).
<li>... They conducted an evacuation of besieged American embassy personnel in Rwanda...
<li>... They surged forces to the Arabian gulf twice when Saddam Hussein made threatening troop movements.
<li>... They showed force off of North Korea to show our nation's resolve during nuclear talks.
<li>... They conducted counter-drug operations in the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean.
</ul>
These actions... and the day to day presence of our Sailors and Marines throughout the Pacific... have contributed to peace and a brighter future.  And that's why our people choose to serve: because it is exciting and personally rewarding beyond compare when you are out there making a difference.<br>
<br>
When measured against their civilian peers, our people achieve levels of extraordinary responsibility at a very young age.  We have young Sailors who you wouldn't have trusted with your car keys a couple years ago, who today stand at the helm of this 40,000 ton ship!<br>
<br>
However, more impressively, our men and women in uniform stand apart because they are selfless patriots.  They have larger interests of the nation in their sights and their hearts.  They work tirelessly not because they have to, but because they want to.  They work until the work is done, without any overtime wages.<br>
<br>
Vice Admiral Dave Robinson is certainly such a person.  He has spent much of his life at sea... Aboard everything from small patrol boats in Vietnam...  to the aircraft carrier Teddy Roosevelt in the Mediterranean, where he served as battle group commander.  He has mastered very difficult jobs, time after time, from Main Propulsion Assistant aboard the destroyer USS Stormes... To major flag billets in Washington D.C.<br>
<br>
I can personally attest to his ability to master difficult challenges... because his job here as Commander of the Pacific Fleet's Surface Forces hasn't been easy.  Dave has led a force of nearly 100 ships, nine shore stations, more than 45,000 military and civilian personnel, and a budget of nearly 2 billion dollars.  He masterfully oversaw his force as it downsized... maintaining readiness and personnel quality of life at high levels.<br>
<br>
His accolades are too numerous to list, but I'll mention just a few:<br>
<br><ul>
<li>... He oversaw a complete force reorganization to maintain continuity of training, readiness and operations throughout his ship's deployments.
<li>... He instituted a visionary program of energy conservation which rewards ships with OPTAR funds for saving fuel.
<li>... He increased utilization of reserve assets, including integrating NRF ships into the Tactical Training Strategy and deploying NRF ships.
<li>... He oversaw the transition to regionalized maintenance, helping us consolidate surface and submarine maintenance where it makes sense to save money.
</ul>
In a wide range of programs he founded the decommissioning ship reuse pool, the oil recovery and reuse program, the hazardous material reuse and redistribution program as well as force-wide recycling.  He was always a wise steward of the taxpayers dollars.<br>
<br>
And he achieved this in sensible ways -- without fanfare, but with great regard for the force's readiness and people... people... yes, most importantly, he sought out ways to help his people.  He eliminated rules and requirements that made no sense.  He allowed many ships to move from 3 and 4 sections of duty into 5 or even 6 sections... giving his Sailors more time at home with their families when in port.  He also rebuilt the Operational Propulsion Plant Examination (OPPE) from a dreaded and demoralizing inspection into a valuable and positive training experience.  He truly loves his people... and I can tell you he has been their advocate in each and every action he has undertaken.<br>
<br>
Dave Robinson is a naval officer of unquestionable skill, character, strength, leadership and passion for this force... a force he has served well and faithfully.  Dave, I know you would be the first to give credit to the Sailors of SURFPAC who made it all happen.  But I also know that, from Bremerton to Pearl Harbor, from San Diego to the Arabian gulf, your people give you credit... and they join me in thanking you for your inspirational leadership.  You have been good for our surface force, and this old aviator has heard that every time he stepped aboard a frigate, destroyer, cruiser, amphib or CLF ship.<br>
<br>
Gene, I would be remiss if I didn't say a few words about your vital role in Dave's service to our nation and our Navy.  Every Sailor needs someone to help them navigate through the difficult shoal waters of Navy life.  You have been that navigator, friend, soulmate and more.  33 years ago, it used to be common practice to mention a spouse in a fitness report.  We can't do that anymore, but if I could you'd get perfect marks.<br>
<br>
One of our nation's great Surface Warriors, Admiral Arleigh Burke, once said:<br>
<br>
<em> "The days of our lives pass all too quickly, but when we are busy and happy, as I have been during my years in the Navy, our days leave a great store of wonderful memories."</em><br>
<br>
Dave and Gene, you will no doubt have many wonderful memories as you embark on this next chapter in your life together.  I just hope we stay in touch so I'll know where to come so I can continue to solicit your advice.  I wish you both fair winds and following seas.  God bless and keep you both.  We'll miss you.<br>
<br>
Although we're sad to see Dave go, we're pleased to have the top draft pick to replace him:  Vice Admiral Al Krekich, an experienced naval officer and Surface Warrior with 32 years experience, coming to us from the Pentagon where he was Director of Surface Warfare on the CNO's staff.<br>
<br>
Al and Bobbi, congratulations and welcome to you.  You're joining a first-rate team at SURFPAC... assuming command of an outstanding Surface Force with great people and a vitally important mission.  You bring impeccable credentials of past successes... And I know you are fully up to each and every challenge ahead.<br>
<br>
Let me close by congratulating all the men, women and families of SURFPAC for many accomplishments over the past three years.  I'd also like to thank our friends and supporters from the community who have joined us here for this special occasion.<br>
<br>
In a country that often finds itself searching for good news in the midst of concerns, you are all part of the page one headlines about the Pacific Fleet success story.<br>
<br>
Thank you all, and god bless.<br>

<h1>San Diego<br>World Affairs Council</h1>
<h2>Remarks as prepared for<br>Admiral R. J. Zlatoper, USN<br>
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet</h2>
<hr>
<strong>San Diego, Calif. (Friday, April 19, 1996)</strong><br><br>
Thank you and good morning, or Aloha ... as we say back at headquarters.  As nice as Hawaii is, it's great to be in an even bigger Navy town than Pearl Harbor... and to talk to the San Diego World Affairs Council for the first time.  I appreciate the important function which World Affairs Councils serve in our communities... increasing public awareness of issues of international concern. <br>
<br>
I have to tell you, you'd be surprised at the amount of international awareness there is among our men and women in uniform...  I just came from across the bay where I was speaking at the change of command ceremony for the Commander of the Pacific Fleet Surface Force.  I talked directly to the many Sailors standing in ranks... who are on the front lines of our nation's defense... and spoke of the importance of their mission in the U.S. Navy. <br>
<br>
Afterwards, several came up to ask me questions... Not about the drinking age on our bases, or food on the messdecks... But about geopolitics and security concerns. <br>
<br>
As proud as I was in Charlottesville then, I'm even prouder to be in San Diego with you today... in a true Navy town.  Many people don't realize San Diego is the second largest naval installation in the world. <br>
<br>
There's a great partnership here between the military and civilian communities... A partnership because it has immense benefits for both parties involved.  San Diego reaps the economic benefits of having a large military presence... With $13.5 billion annually pumped into the local economy.  In fact, even after downsizing, San Diego is one of the few places whose relative piece of the shrinking defense pie has actually increased. <br>
<br>
But economics are only part of the benefit... because our people make positive community contributions as well:  from Cub Scout leaders to little league coaches and Sunday school teachers, our people contribute substantively and are an integral part of the social fabric of the communities in which we live.  Navy families consider San Diego a great place to live, and want to contribute positively. <br>
<br>
And just as our partnership provides benefit to the city of San Diego, it also provides benefit to the Navy.  We get a strategic position on our nation's Pacific coast... with a deep water port, a supportive civilian community, and great quality of life for our people. <br>
<br>
As I talk to you today, think you will see why places like San Diego, Puget Sound and Pearl Harbor will be increasingly important to our nation's defense in the next century... the Century of the Pacific. <br>
<br>
With a name like "Zlatoper", you might think I was here to talk about the situation in the Balkans.  Even for those of us with ethnic backgrounds of European, African or Hispanic roots... and therefore who have their hearts to the east or south, our wallets are in the Pacific. <br>
<br>
I've become known in Navy circles as the preacher from the west ... a missionary with a message about the growing importance of the Pacific for all Americans.  That's not a complete surprise to a group of well-informed business and community leaders like yourselves on the west coast... But I hope to add to your base of knowledge, and lay the foundation for discussion after my remarks. <br>
<br>
I'd like to share three points with you today:  why Americans should care about the Pacific;  what our concerns are in the Pacific;  and how the U.S. Pacific Fleet is addressing those concerns, even after a significant reduction in the size of the Fleet. <br>
<br>
First, why should we care about the Pacific?  There are economic, political, and military reasons why the Pacific is becoming the most important region of the world for Americans. <br>
<br>
First, the economic perspective:  we have witnessed an astounding, unprecedented growth of Asian economies.  The growth rate of developing Asian nations averaged 7.3% from 1985 to 1995 (compared to 3.4% for Japan, 2.6% for U.S. And 2.2% for Europe).  Asian gross national product now is more than 30% of the world's total ... Having surpassed the total for Europe in 1991-92 (22%).  And the Asian share of world GNP is expected to climb to 50% by the middle of the next century. <br>
<br>
The world's economic and industrial center of gravity is shifting to the Pacific.  Trends in U.S. Trade have followed this pattern:  aggregate trade with Asian nations represents 37% of total U.S. Trade... more than that of the European Union and Latin America combined.  3 million American jobs are directly related to exports and investments in Asia.  And that is expected to climb to 6 million over the next decade.  These aren't low paying "Mcjobs" of the service industry, but rather jobs which pay an average of 14% above non-export related jobs. <br>
<br>
With 3.5 billion potential customers, our ability to engage in trade and commerce with these nations is vital to our domestic economy. <br>
<br>
The region is important to the United States politically, as well.  It is a vast and diverse region (as I well know ... keeping up with developments throughout 16 time zones).  It accounts for more than half of the earth's surface and two-thirds of the world's population.  Asia includes the world's largest democracy (India), the world's two largest Islamic populations (Indonesia and India), the largest remaining communist nations (China and North Korea), and dozens of nations whose futures hang in the balance today, politically and economically. <br>
<br>
Nine million Americans of Asian or Pacific ancestry give us yet another reason to care about the region.  That means that the hearts of more and more Americans are in Asia. <br>
<br>
With these economic and political interests in the Asia-Pacific, it's no surprise why we have such strong security interests.  Asia has no over-arching security umbrella like NATO.  U.S. military presence is the one constant... providing the equilibrium for peace and security. <br>
<br>
Former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Joseph Nye (now Dean of the JFK School of Government), expressed it another way:<br>
<br><em> "Security is like oxygen:  you do not tend to notice it until you begin to lose it. The American security presence has helped provide this 'oxygen' for East Asian development."</em><br>
<br>
With all of these reasons to care about the Pacific, what should be our concerns?  We just saw one vivid example last month:  when differences between China and Taiwan heated up.  Such a crisis could have disrupted peace, trade, the entire region's economic growth... and our own well being.  Even though not a single shot was fired:<br>
<ul>
<li>Stock markets in the region plunged, 
<li>Investors scrambled to convert currencies to dollars and gold, 
<li>High-tech companies south of San Francisco talked of a potential silicon crisis -- akin to oil crises caused by past conflicts in the Arabian Gulf,
<li>And newspaper headlines warned ominously of closed sea lanes, rice hoarding, and instability in a region built on open trade routes and political calm.</ul>
Much is at stake in our country ... when you pause to consider that China and Taiwan are the 2nd and 4th largest overseas trading partners of the U.S. <br>
<br>
The tension between China and Taiwan is only one of several long-standing animosities in the region.  Other trouble spots include India and Pakistan, China and India, Russia and Japan, Iran and Iraq (in southwest Asia) and the Korean Peninsula, another festering issue that has been capturing headlines in the past few days.  It is particularly concerning because the North spends 25% of its GNP on defense despite a stalled economy and famine. <br>
<br>
There also is civil strife or insurgencies in more than a dozen countries, from the Philippines and Sri Lanka to Somalia and Rwanda. <br>
<br>
Many Asian nations harbor concerns about the long-term ambitions of regional powers like China and Japan. <br>
<br>
Then there is the alarming militarization of Iran, and continued threats from Iraq...all in a region that supplies oil for most of the world. <br>
<br>
As populations grow and demand for natural resources increases, we expect to see greater potential for conflict over resources.  Competing claims over the Spratly Islands has this potential... China, Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei all claim at least a portion of this area ... potentially rich in oil and other resources. <br>
<br>
And then there's Russia:  We all hope for positive development, politically and economically, in the former Soviet republics.  We conducted bilateral exercises in Hawaii with Russian Navy last year, and it was a very positive experience. <br>
<br>
But Russia still retains significant military capabilities which must be watched... particularly their submarine program, which is still alive and well. <br>
<br>
In summary, there are plenty of reasons to be concerned about our interests and prospects for peace.  And there's no shortage of military potential when you consider Asia is home to 7 of the 9 largest militaries in the world, the world's 2 largest standing armies and 7 of the 10 most numerous submarine forces. <br>
<br>
Given our growing stake in Asia, and potential threats to our interests and peace, what is the Pacific Fleet doing to protect American interests and promote peace in the Asia-Pacific region?  Our guiding strategy is called "Cooperative Engagement"... using our strong presence in the region to engage Asian nations to promote peace and stability. <br>
<br>
In 1995, the Pacific Fleet contributed to this strategy through 125 exercises with 25 nations, Navy-to-Navy talks, personnel exchanges, 800 port visits to 40 nations and hundreds of community relations projects. <br>
<br>
These activities show our goodwill, build partnerships, and reduce the chances of miscalculation that could result in military confrontation.  Countries who may not trust their neighbors see the U.S. as an "honest broker"... with no territorial claims or ambitions in the region. <br>
<br>
I have traveled to many of these countries and met with leaders... and am consistently amazed at the overwhelming consensus on this issue... They want the U.S. To keep its forward presence in the Pacific. <br>
<br>
Two month's ago in Singapore, I heard Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defense, Dr. Tan Ke Yam, declare to a room full of delegates from other Asian nations:<br>
<br><em> "For many years now, the military presence of the U.S. has been and continues to be a factor for stability in the region."</em><br>
<br>
Recent tension between China and Taiwan clearly illustrates the value of our being there in Asian waters, with capable and ready naval forces.  When needed, ships of USS Independence battle group were only a couple of days away from Taiwan area.  Their readiness became an unmistakable expression of American commitment, communicated world-wide on CNN and other media. <br>
<br>
As a precaution, the President underlined our resolve a few days later by ordering a 2nd battle group to the western Pacific, led by the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz.  These actions sent a powerful signal of U.S. interest in a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue, reducing the chance of either side making a miscalculation or taking unwise action. <br>
<br>
This was at least the 8th time since I became CINCPACFLT 20 months ago that Pacific Fleet forces have been called upon for real-world operational contingencies.  There was also:<br>
<br><ul>
<li>Haiti (where we loaned ships to the Atlantic Fleet)
<li>Iraq twice ... in the falls of '94 and '95.  
<li>Rwanda... where Pacific Fleet units conducted an evacuation of U.S. Embassy personnel
<li>Somalia... Covering the withdrawal of UN forces.
<li>The Korean peninsula ... where naval presence helped deter aggression while tough negotiations concluded a framework to address the North's nuclear program.
<li>and Bosnia ... Where PACFLT contributed EA-6B electronic countermeasures aircraft, and Seabees to build bridges, base camps, command posts and other facilities for U.S. troops.</ul>
The fact is, Fleet operating tempo is as high now as in any period of the Cold War, but we're doing so with much smaller force.  5 years ago my predecessor had 250 ships and 280,000 Sailors and Marines.  Today, I have 196 ships and 215,000 Sailors and Marines. <br>
<br>
Given the smaller size of the Fleet, we are stretching our resources and changing the way we do business in many respects.     I'll give you seven quick examples... and would be happy to go into detail if you have questions.  In fact, I'd be interested in hearing comparisons to how your businesses are making such changes. <br>
<br>
First -- we are eliminating rules and requirements that make no sense... What a concept for the military! <br>
<br>
Second -- we are placing increased reliance on our Forward Deployed Naval Forces.  The USS Independence carrier battle group and USS Belleau Wood amphibious ready group operate from Japan.  These forces have not been affected by overall down-sizing.  It would take 4-5 times the number of ships homeported in continental U.S. to equal their presence... and Japan pays 70% of the cost! <br>
<br>
Third -- modernization throughout the Fleet permits us to make our battle groups and amphibious groups smaller, without sacrificing most capabilities. <br>
<br>
Fourth -- we are training smarter with state of the art training facilities, electronic links to simulate forces and scenarios,   ...and a more tailored approach to training requirements. <br>
<br>
Fifth -- restructuring and re-engineering where we can achieve efficiencies, including:  smaller and more streamlined shore infrastructure; regionalized maintenance support; even reorganized battle groups. <br>
<br>
Sixth -- increased cooperation between Fleets, U.S. services, and international partners.  We have come a long way since the days when we couldn't operate effectively, or sometimes even communicate with our allies, the U.S. Army and Air Force, or between the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets! <br>
<br>
And seventh, we're utilizing our reserve forces more than ever before.  Nearly 700 units with 30,000 selected reserves... adds 22% more forces if mobilized in crisis or conflict.  In peacetime, adds dedicated and expert people and additional ships and airplanes to help me meet commitments with a much smaller active-duty force. <br>
<br>
Perhaps most important in our efforts to cover requirements with a smaller Fleet:  we are protecting our most important resource -- Navy people.  Manpower reductions have been accomplished in such a way as to retain the faith of Navy men and women.  Today, we are strongly committed to controlling deployment lengths and personnel tempo... keeping Sailors at home with their families as much as we can. <br>
<br>
I know that even the best ships and aircraft would be useless without Sailors to operate and maintain them... and supportive families backing them up.  That's why we're actually increasing the amount of money we spend on quality of life projects like housing, fitness centers and military commissaries. <br>
<br>
Navy men and women are paying us back with their loyalty, motivation and tremendous skills.  It's absolutely awe-inspiring to see the flight deck of a carrier in operation around the clock... with the same young kids that you would not have trusted with your car keys a couple of years ago! <br>
<br>
By the way, we still need about 55,000 of these sharp young people a year... to keep our Navy young and upwardly mobile.  What better recruiter could there be than a responsible and internationally-aware member of the community?   Please help pass the word:  we still are hiring! <br>
<br>
With the great men and women of the Navy today, advanced ships and aircraft, and better ways of doing business ... I am very optimistic about your Navy and the Pacific Fleet's ability to continue supporting American interests in the Asia-Pacific region. <br>
<br>
We need to be vigilant to avoid a backslide on readiness ... as we try to balance operating costs, modernization and investments for weapons systems for the future. <br>
<br>
One of my predecessors said it in these words:<br>
<br><em> "We must make certain now, and for the future, that the peace is secure.  We must remain strong.  Never again should we risk the threat which weakness invites."</em><br>
<br>
That was Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, 51 years ago -- a month after the end of World War Two. <br>
<br>
Today we are strong, and we are ready to support national interests in the Asia-Pacific region, and around the word.  For the Navy and Marine Corps together, this costs five cents of every tax dollar.  Can you find a better spent nickel from your tax dollar? <br>
<br>
I thank you for your support ... And for your hospitality.<br>

<h1>Ribbon Cutting Ceremony:<br>Moanalua Terrace Housing</h1>
<h2>Remarks as prepared for<br>Admiral R. J. Zlatoper, USN<br>
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Pearl Harbor, Hawaii (Tuesday, April 2, 1996)</strong><br><br>
Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, Senator Akaka, Congressman Abercrombie, my flying mate back from Washington -- Congresswoman Mink and I shared an airplane Saturday night coming back here to paradise --  and our many other distinguished guests here ... Most importantly, members of our very proud Navy family -- and we are family:  I offer my warmest Aloha and a good afternoon to all of you. <br>
<br>
I always like to say what a great day this is ... and it is -- not just temperature-wise, but about what we're here for:  to see the labor of so many come to fruition, as we gather together for a very special event. <br>
<br>
As Rear Admiral Holder said, it seems like it was only a few months ago that I was at the controls of a bulldozer, with a very nervous Seabee standing-by, helping to demolish the first of Moanalua Terrace's old homes.<br>
<br>
We really have come far, and we've come there quickly.  That's a credit to a great number of key people.  I'm going to echo a lot of what you've heard from Admiral Holder already, but I think the echoes are warranted: <br>
<br>
First, there's Mike Hunt's team of builders that came out and did this great job, local craftsmen, local contractors who have done just an absolutely marvelous job of completing these fine homes ... on schedule and under budget.  We need to talk to you about some military hardware we want you to build in the near future!<br>
<br>
Most importantly, my wife, who is the housing pro in the world, if you will, has declared these quality products. <br>
<br>
Next, as Senator Inouye recognized in Congress last week, we have to thank our senior Navy leadership for their strong personnel support for improving Navy housing out here in Hawaii after a visit the Secretary made here in 1994. <br>
<br>
Third, we need to recognize our other Navy leaders and the leadership of the Department of Defense for their steadfast commitment to quality of  life, putting their money where their mouths were, and staying the course despite growing pressures on the military budget on a daily basis. <br>
<br>
And finally, a very special thank you to Senator Inouye and the entire Hawaii Congressional delegation, and Senator Stevens -- you are an honorary member of that this afternoon -- including the other members of Congress, who made some very tough choices and some very smart ones in keeping committed to supporting these housing improvements. <br>
<br>
These houses that are about to become homes that you see about you, plus the other quality of life projects underway throughout Hawaii, and throughout the fleet, can be thought of as an investment in long-term readiness of the fleet because they address our single most important resource:  our service personnel and their families. <br>
<br>
Not a day goes by that I don't find myself absolutely marveling at the quality of the women and the men that wear our uniform in the service -- the Marines and the Navy. <br>
<br>
And much of the world took notice of our Sailors just this past month when, once again, they proved themselves ready and worthy of meeting a challenge in the Western Pacific when they were called upon to demonstrate our nation's strong interest and commitment in maintaining peace between China and Taiwan. <br>
<br>
We canceled a return to homeport for the USS Independence carrier battle group and positioned them east of Taiwan to monitor Chinese military activity and to discourage miscalculation by any party involved. <br>
<br>
And then we redeployed the USS Nimitz battle group, which included Pearl Harbor ships, out of the Arabian gulf, and had them make the trip from the Arabian Gulf to the Western Pacific as an additional precaution. <br>
<br>
And then, when the battle group commander of those two carrier task groups was asked by a reporter whether his Sailors resented the delay in their homecoming, he responded, "My Sailors don't ask, 'Why us?'.  They state, with a lot of pride, 'Who else?'"<br>
<br>
And that's very, very true. <br>
<br>
Thanks to those great Sailors -- those patriots -- the crisis has subsided and we're here this afternoon to enjoy a beautiful day at the hub of the Pacific without a lot of worry about America's huge and growing economic and political interests in Asia. <br>
<br>
And thanks to projects such as this that surrounds us right now, our Sailors performing those critical missions throughout the Pacific don't have to worry about the adequacy of the housing for the families they're leaving behind. <br>
<br>
That's important because a Sailor can't do her or his best if they are worried about the well-being of their families back home.  And the Navy can't expect that Sailor to respond quickly and effectively without full support for the family back home.<br>
<br>
The most technologically advanced ships and aircraft in the world -- and that's what we have in the United States Pacific Fleet right now -- are worth very little, in fact nothing at all -- without the trained men and women to operate them. <br>
<br>
I don't have to remind our guest of honor this afternoon of those priorities, because he reminds me of them whenever we meet. <br>
<br>
He's a veteran of our armed forces, a long-time leader of the Congress, and he's a statesmen from the Pacific, who is for the Pacific. <br>
<br>
But he also knows the importance of caring for Navy men and women their families. <br>
<br>
We simply couldn't ask for a better look-out for our service members, along with the military employees throughout Hawaii, than Senator Dan Inouye. <br>
<br>
As we approach what many say will be the "Century of the Pacific," he has made certain that Hawaii will be prepared to be the strategic hub for the entire Pacific Rim. <br>
<br>
Senator Inouye, we appreciate greatly your steadfast support, and are truly honored to have you here for this very special occasion. <br>
<br>
Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm Aloha welcome to Senator Daniel Inouye.... <br>

<h1>Dallas Committee<br>on Foreign Relations</h1>
<h2>Remarks as prepared for<br>Admiral R. J. Zlatoper, USN<br>
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Petroleum Club, Dallas, Texas (Wednesday, March 20, 1996)</strong><br><br>
Thank you and good afternoon, or Aloha, as we say back at headquarters.  As nice as Hawaii is ... It's great to be in the Lone Star State.  Though 3,500 miles from my headquarters, I feel very much at home here for a couple of reasons.<br>
<br>
First and foremost, there's the warm welcome you've extended.  Second, Texas is a well-known as a stronghold of traditional American values and patriotism... at least that's what I am told:  my daughter wanted to go to the University of Texas.  I'm also surrounded by Texans in the Navy.<br>
<br>
Our Surface Force Commander is Vice Admiral Dave Robinson (from Denton);  the Deputy Commander in Chief is Rear Admiral Herb Browne (from McKinney);  Chief of Staff, from the naval reserves, is Bob Smith;  also from Texas, the number one Sailor in the Navy, John Dalton, Secretary of the Navy;  and looking over my shoulder daily -- Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz!<br>
<br>
Between these and a few thousand more Texans in the Pacific Fleet, they keep me on course ... And rooting for the right football team ... Or basketball team, in the case of Texas Tech in this year's NCAA tournament.<br>
<br>
Over the past 20 months, have put in many hours at the same desk used by Admiral Nimitz ... and living in the same quarters where he met many nights with his staff on the latest operational developments in the war.  Sometimes I wonder what he would think about the quality of officers in the U.S. Navy today.<br>
<br>
This lunch definitely will add to my good opinion of Texas.  Would like to thank James Gruppo and the Texas Commerce Bank for hosting this event.  Organizations such as Dallas Committee on Foreign Relations serve a very important function... by increasing awareness of issues of international concern.<br>
<br>
With a Slovenian name like "Zlatoper", you might think I was here to talk about the situation in the Balkans.  I'm actually here as a missionary of the Pacific.  Cultural backgrounds of many Americans, and therefore hearts, may be in Europe, but wallets are in the Pacific.<br>
<br>
Would like to share three points with you:  why all Americans should care about the Pacific;  what our concerns are in the Pacific;  and how the U.S. Pacific Fleet is addressing those concerns, even after a significant reduction in the size of the Fleet.<br>
<br>
First, why should we care about the Pacific?  There are strong economic and political reasons why the Pacific is becoming the most important region of the world for Americans.  Economic, political and military considerations prove this point.<br>
<br>
First, the economic perspective:  we have witnessed an astounding, unprecedented growth of Asian economies.  Asian gross national product is more than 30% of the world's total ... Having surpassed the total for europe in 1991-92 (22%).  Asian share of world gnp expected to climb to 50% by the middle of the next century.  Growth rate of developing Asian nations averaged 7.3% from 1985 to 1995 (compared to 3.4% for Japan, 2.6% for U.S. and 2.2% for  europe).  World's economic and industrial center of gravity is shifting to the Pacific.<br>
<br>
Trends in U.S. trade have followed this pattern:  aggregate trade with Asian nations represents 37% of total U.S. trade...  More than that of european union and latin America combined.  3 million American jobs directly related to exports and investments in Asia.  Expected to climb to 6 million over the next decade.  These aren't low paying "Mcjobs" of the service industry, but rather jobs which pay an average of 14% above non-export related  jobs.  With 3.5 billion potential customers, our ability to engage in trade/commerce with these nations is vital to our domestic economy.  I suspect many of you in business know this better than I.<br>
<br>
Region is important to the United States politically, as well.
It's a vast and diverse region (as I well know ... keeping up with developments throughout 16 time zones). It comprises more than half of the earth's surface and two-thirds of the world's population.  Asia includes:<br>
<br><ul>
<li>The world's largest democracy (India)
<li>The world's two largest islamic populations (Indonesia and India)
<li>The largest remaining communist nations (China and North Korea)
<li>Dozens of nations whose futures hang in the balance today, politically and economically.</ul>
Nine million Americans of Asian or Pacific ancestry give us yet another reason to care about the region (means that the hearts of more and more Americans are in Asia).<br>
<br>
With these economic and political interests in the Asia-Pacific, it's no  surprise why we have such strong security interests.  Asia has no over-arching security umbrella like NATO.  U.S. military presence is the one constant... providing the equilibrium for peace and security.<br>
<br>
Former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Joseph Nye (who's now dean of the JFK School of Government), expressed it another way:<br>
<br><em> "Security is like oxygen:  you do not tend to notice it until you begin to lose it. The American security presence has helped provide this 'oxygen' for east Asian development."</em><br>
<br>
With all of these reasons to care about the Pacific, what should be our concerns?<br>
<br>
In recent weeks, you only have to pick up the Dallas Morning News or tune into CNN to see one example.  Differences between China and Taiwan have the potential to disrupt peace, trade, the entire region's economic growth and our own well being.  Look what's happened already:  stock markets in the region have plunged, investors are scrambling to convert currencies to dollars and gold, and newspaper headlines warn ominously of closed sea lanes, rice hoarding, and instability in a region built on open trade routes and political calm.<br>
<br>
Much is at stake in our country ... when you pause to consider that China and Taiwan are the 2nd and 4th largest overseas trading partners of the U.S.  A report from California last week said that some high tech companies that rely on Taiwan for manufacturing silicon semiconductors are worried that production could be impeded.  There is talk about a potential silicon crisis -- akin to oil crises caused by past conflicts in the Arabian Gulf.<br>
<br>
The tension between China and Taiwan is only one of several long-standing animosities in the region.  Other trouble spots include... India and Pakistan;  China and India;  Russia and Japan;  in southwest Asia... Iran and Iraq;  and the Korean peninsula... where the North spends 25% of its GNP on defense despite a stalled economy and famine. <br>
<br>
There also is civil strife or insurgencies in more than a dozen countries, from the Philippines and Sri Lanka to Somalia and Rwanda.  Many Asian nations harbor concerns about the long-term ambitions of regional powers like China and Japan. <br>
<br>
Then there is the alarming militarization of Iran, and continued threats from Iraq...all in a region that supplies oil for most of the world.  As populations grow and demand for natural resources increases, expect to see greater potential for conflict over resources.  Competing claims over the Spratly Islands has this potential... China, Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei all claim at least a portion of this oil rich area. <br>
<br>
And then there's Russia... We all hope for positive development, politically and economically, in the former Soviet republics.  The Pacific Fleet conducted bilateral exercises in Hawaii with Russian Navy last year.  It was a very positive experience.  But Russia still retains significant military capabilities which must be watched... particularly their submarine program, which is still alive and well. <br>
<br>
In summary, there are plenty of reasons to be concerned about our interests and prospects for peace.  And there's no shortage of military potential when you consider Asia has:  7 of the 9 largest militaries in the world;  the world's 2 largest standing armies;  and 7 of the 10 most numerous submarine forces. <br>
<br>
Given our growing stake in Asia, and potential threats to our interests and pease, what is the Pacific Fleet doing to protect American interests and promote peace in the Asia-Pacific region?  Our guiding strategey is called "cooperative engagement"... largely by maintaining strong presence in the region. <br>
<br>
In 1995, the Pacific Fleet contributed to this strategy through 125 exercises with 25 nations... Navy-to-Navy talks... Personnel exchanges... 800 port visits to 40 nations... And hundreds of community relations projects.  These activities show our goodwill, build partnerships, and reduce the chances of miscalculation that could result in military confrontation. <br>
<br>
Countries who may not trust their neighbors see the U.S. as an "honest broker"... With no territorial claims or ambitions in the region.  I have traveled to many of these countries and met with leaders... and I am continually amazed at the overwhelming consensus on this issue: They want the U.S. to keep its forward presence in the Pacific. <br>
<br>
Two month's ago in Singapore, I heard Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defense, Dr. Tan Ke Yam, declare to a room full of delegates from other Asian nations:<br>
<br><em> "For many years now, the military presence of the U.S. has been and continues to be a factor for stability in the region."</em><br>
<br>
Recent tension between China and Taiwan clearly illustrates the value of our being there in Asian waters, with capable and ready naval forces.  When needed, ships of the USS Independence battle group were only a couple of days away from Taiwan area.  Their readiness became an unmistakable expression of American commitment, communicated world-wide on CNN and other media. <br>
<br>
As a precaution, the President underlined our resolve a few days later by ordering a 2nd battle group to the western Pacific, led by the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (there's that Texas connection again!). <br>
<br>
It adds up to powerful signal of U.S. interest in a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue, reducing the chance of either side making a miscalculation or taking unwise action.  And as Secretary of the Navy Joh Dalton told Congress last week, "this is what you get when you fund the Navy and Marine Corps... These forces are forward deployed -- and ready -- as part of our sticker price!" <br>
<br>
This is at least the 8th time since I  became CINCPACFLT 20 months ago that Pacific Fleet forces have been called upon for real-world operational contingencies: <br><ul>
<li>Haiti (where we loaned ships to the Atlantic Fleet).
<li>Iraq twice ... In the falls of '94 and '95.  
<li>Rwanda... evacuation of U.S. embassy personnel
<li>Somalia ... Covering withdrawal of UN forces.  
<li>The Korean peninsula ... Where naval presence helped deter aggression while tough negotiations concluded a framework to address the north's nuclear program.
<li>And Bosnia ... Where PACFLT contributed EA-6B electronic countermeasures aircraft, and Seabees to build bridges, base camps, command posts and other facilities for U.S. troops.</ul>
The fact is ... Fleet operating tempo is as high now as in any period of the Cold War, but we're doing so with much smaller force.  5 years ago my predecessor had 250 ships and 280,000 Sailors and Marines.  Today I have 196 ships and 215,000 Sailors and Marines. <br>
<br>
Given smaller size of the Fleet, we are stretching our resources and changing the way we do business in many respects.   I'll give you seven quick examples... And would be happy to go into detail if you have  questions (in fact, I'd be very interested in parallels to your challenges of business). <br>
<br>
First -- we are eliminating rules and requirements that make no sense... What a concept for the military! <br>
<br>
Second -- increased reliance on our forward deployed naval forces.  The USS Independence carrier battle group and USS Belleau Wood amphibious ready group operate from Japan.  These forces have not been affected by overall down-sizing.  It would take 4-5 times the number of ships homeported in continental U.S. to equal their presence... and Japan pays 70% of the cost! <br>
Third -- modernization throughout the Fleet permits us to make our battle groups and amphibious groups smaller, without sacrificing most capabilities. <br>
<br>
Fourth -- we are training smarter with state of the art training facilities, electronic links to simulate forces and scenarios,   ...and more tailored approach to training requirements. <br>
<br>
Fifth -- restructuring and re-engineering where we can achieve efficiencies ... Including:  smaller and more streamlined shore infrastructure;  regionalized maintenance support;  even reorganized battle groups. <br>
<br>
Sixth -- much increased cooperation between Fleets, U.S. services, and international partners.  We have come a long way since the days when we couldn't operate effectively, or sometimes even communicate with our allies, the U.S. Army and Air Force, or between the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets! <br>
<br>
And seventh, what I call my most important force multiplier for resources -- the U.S. naval reserve.  Adds 22% more forces if mobilized in crisis or conflict.  In peacetime, add dedicated and expert people and additional ships and airplanes to help me meet commitments with a much smaller active-duty force.  Contributions of Admiral Bob Smith and reserves from the Dallas area are a great example.  Told them so at Naval Air Station Dallas this morning. <br>
<br>
Perhaps most important in our efforts to cover requirements with a smaller Fleet:  we are protecting our most important resource -- Navy people.  Manpower reductions have been accomplished in such a way as to retain the faith of Navy men and women.  Today, we are strongly committed to controlling deployment lengths and personnel tempo... Keeping Sailors at home with their families as much as we can. <br>
<br>
I know that even the best ships and aircraft would be useless without Sailors to operate and maintain them... and supportive families backing them up.  That's why we're actually increasing the amount of money we spend on quality of life projects like housing, fitness centers and military commissaries. <br>
<br>
Navy men and women are paying us back with their loyalty, motivation and tremendous skills.  It's awe-inspiring to see the flight deck of an aircraft carrier in operation around the clock... with same young kids that you would not have trusted with car keys a couple of years ago! <br>
<br>
By the way, we still need about 55,000 of these sharp young people a year to keep our Navy young and upwardly mobile.  Please help pass the word:  we still are hiring! <br>
<br>
With the great men and women of the Navy today, advanced ships and aircraft, and better ways of doing business... I am very optimistic about your Navy and the Pacific Fleet's ability to continue supporting American interests in the Asia-Pacific region.  We need to be vigilant to avoid backslide on readiness ... As we try to balance operating costs, modernization and investments for weapons systems for the future. <br> 
<br>
The Navy and Marine Corps together cost five cents of every tax dollar in order to support operations around the world 24 hours a day, wherever U.S. interests are at stake.  Can you find a better spent nickel from your tax dollar?  If you'd like to see for yourself, I encourage you to visit your Navy at San Diego, Seattle or Pearl Harbor.  We'll put you to sea, and let you spend some "quality time" with the world's greatest Sailors.  Just let Bob Smith know if you are interested, and we would be happy to arrange a personal, customized visit. <br>
<br>
I'll close with the words of a famous Texan:<br>
<br><em> "We must make certain, now and for the future, that peace is secure.  We must remain strong.  Never again should we risk the threat which weakness invites."</em><br>
<br>
Those were the words of Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz 50 years ago, reflecting on the end of the Second World War.  We are ready and strong today, and I thank you for your support ... and for your hospitality. <br>
<br>
Thank you and God Bless you all. <Br>

<h1>Association of Former Intelligence Officers</h1>
<h2>Remarks as prepared for<br>Admiral R. J. Zlatoper, USN<br>
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Hale Koa Hotel, Honolulu, Hawaii (Friday, March 1, 1996)</strong><br><br>
Aloha and good day... It's a pleasure to join such a distinguished group of people who have served in our nation's clandestine services.  I know the job of an intelligence officer -- whether military or civilian -- can be a thankless job... often unnoticed and unknown to most Americans, but yet so vital to our national security.  I'm glad that AFIO is helping to show Americans the many important things that our intelligence community does on a daily basis.<br>
<br>
I'm especially happy to be talking to the AFIO group here in Hawaii -- the hub of the Pacific.  I spend a lot of time traveling around the mainland telling Americans why they should care about the Pacific (always surprises them with a Slovenian name like "Zlatoper").  I want to talk today not just about the Pacific, but also about the role that intelligence plays to me as the Fleet commander.<br>
<br>
Certainly don't need to tell a group like this what our cares and concerns are in the Pacific... But here are a few tidbits you might be interested in:  37% of U.S. trade is with Asian nations... compared with 20% for European Union.  The world's economic and industrial centers of gravity aren't shifting to the west... They've shifted.	  3 million American jobs are directly dependent upon trade and investments in Asia... growing to 6 million in the next decade.<br>
<br>
We also have significant concerns in Asia... seen just by opening a newspaper:  China's saber rattling at Taiwan... continued threats from North Korea... coupled with internal disorder caused by famine.  Disputes over Takeshima / Tokto islands and EEZ's between South Korea and Japan.  Quarrels over rights to Spratly Islands.  Historic animosities between India and Pakistan.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, the Pacific Fleet is engaged in the region... Promoting peace and stability.  Over 800 port visits and 125 exercises with nearly 25 nations annually in the Pacific Command area of responsibility.  Intel sharing initiatives are also a major component of cooperative engagement strategy:  we share not only data, but also methodology with several nations... Which enhances our interoperability.  Contrary to what you might think, intel sharing is a 2-way street... Just as we provide intel, we receive back extremely valuable information.<br>
<br>
Staff talks, Navy-to-Navy relationships, personnel exchanges and civic action projects also contribute.  They encourage transparency and reduce the chance of miscalculation which could lead to conflict.<br>
<br>
We have been credited with guaranteeing the stability of Asia... even called the "oxygen" which allows for strong economic growth.  Just a few weeks ago in Singapore, heard Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Dr. Tan Keng Yam say:<br>
<br><em>
"For many years now, the military presence of the U.S. has been and continues to be a key factor for stability in the region."</em>
<br><br>
This sentiment is echoed by leaders throughout Asia and the Pacific, who see U.S. presence -- particularly the routine presence of our Navy ships and aircraft -- as the key to maintaining the peace in Asia.<br>
<br>
Amazing thing is that we're maintaining this strong forward presence with a smaller Fleet.  196 ships and 215,000 Sailors and Marines today, compared with 250 ships and 250,000 Sailors and Marines five years ago.<br>
<br>
How are we keeping our strength in spite of having a smaller force?  By doing things smarter.  Eliminating rules and requirements that don't make sense.  Increased utilization of reserve assets... Using special skills that reservists have from civilian jobs (like computer programming).  Increased reliance on Forward Deployed Naval Forces assets (one ship in Japan = 4-5 continental United States based ships)  modernizing and upgrading... Allowing for smaller battle groups which actually have greater capabilities.  Fleet coordination... Standardizing our procedures and instructions so we can integrate seamlessly in the gulf or Caribbean.  Regional maintenance... Eliminating unnecessary redundancy by combining surface and sub maintenance facilities.<br>
<br>
Navy's intel community has also made some positive changes in the way it does business:  first, the intel community has become much more joint over the past 5 years.  As a Navy battle group commander in desert storm, I was seeing a Navy-specific intel picture -- different than the Army commanders on the ground were seeing... Made for some problems.  Today, we've combined our intel centers (Fleet Intelligence Center, or FIC, changed to the Joint Intelligence Center, or JIC, in 1991).<br>
<br>
They produce a common product for the different users.  Another benefit of jointness:  interoperability... Today can link real time intel data from awacs to ships, or from submarines to ground combatants... A far cry from the past.  Has resulted in more efficiency:  used to have 1200 personnel in three intel centers in Hawaii... Now 700 in one... And the product is improved.<br>
<br>
Brings me to my second point... intel is now more user friendly.  Spoke to Dennis Blair and Secretary Deutch about this last fall... There's a real push at the highest levels for a product which on-scene commanders can use easily.  Now have an information server system called "Intelink"... which is carried over our JDISS (Joint Deployable Intelligence Support System).  Intelink is as easy to use as the world wide web... Intel officers on our carriers, big deck amphibs or ashore can "surf" intel sites (CIA, NSA, CINCPACFLT, etc.) To download specific data needed for a mission.<br>
<br>
Here's an example:  an amphibioius ready group preparing for a non-combatant evacuation operation (NEO) in a place like Somalia could download imagery of Mogadishu immediately... And not have to request it or wait for it.  It makes practical intelligence available at the lowest possible level... And allows for more flexibility in missions.<br>
<br>
Third, intelligence has become more precise and closer to real time:  with the shift towards littoral or coastal warfare, our forces are much closer to the threat than ever before... A threat which today is much more sophisticated.<br>
<br>
And, where we once had targets which were fixed or stationary, today's threats move quickly.  We used to have 5 hours warning before the Bears and Badgers came... Now we may have only 15 minutes.  Receipt of raw data and near real-time analysis is critical in this type of environment.  And, as we fight in this dynamic environment, precision and accuracy are more important than ever:  from a political perspective these days, collateral damage is not acceptable, and immediate battle damage assessment is a must.  Intel needs to be just as precise, if not more, than our weapons systems themselves.<br>
<br>
It's interesting to contrast how the role that intelligence plays for me has changed over the years.<br>
<br>
As an A-6 pilot in Vietnam, it was too little too late.  We would receive warnings of SAM sites sometimes 2 or 3 days after a mission.<br>
As a battle group commander in Desert Storm, we had too much intelligence.  It was a difficult task of sorting out what was really important and what was not.  It was then that I adopted the same set of instructions Colin Powell used to give to his intel officer: tell me what you know, tell me what you don't know, tell me what you think and make sure I know which is which.<br>
<br>
And as a Fleet commander today, intel has come a long way.  Now we get a joint intel picture that is user friendly and more precise than ever.  This helps us tremendously as we downsize, allowing us to utilize our resources in the smartest possible way.<br>
<br>
Would be remiss if I didn't mention the role that Pacific Fleet units play as collectors of intelligence as well:  our forces maintain a robust collection effort... Utilizing air, surface and subsurface assets in support of both national programs and our own tactical programs.  The ability of naval forces to operate at sea gives us some unique capabilities:  surface ship outboard, special submarine missions, air reconnaissance, merchant shipping reports, to name but a few.  It makes me not just a customer, but a provider of intelligence as well.<br>
<br>
Hope I've shed some light on my views of intelligence.  From the perspective as the Fleet commander, it's absolutely vital to everything our Fleet does... From training our people to deploying our forces.  There isn't a flag officer in the Navy who wouldn't agree with that.<br>
<br>
I appreciate the opportunity to break bread with you today... Thank you and God bless you all.<br>

<h1>AFCEA/Naval Institute Expo Convention</h1>
<h2>Remarks as prepared for<br>Admiral R. J. Zlatoper, USN<br>
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet</h2>
<hr>
<strong>San Diego Convention Center (Wednesday, January 24, 1996)</strong><br><br>
Good afternoon... It's a pleasure to address such a distinguished group of defense and industry professionals.  I was hoping to address you at lunch on Friday, but business in Washington demands my presence... so instead you have me today.<br>
<br>
For those of you who were at the luncheon, I know that the CNO is a hard act to follow... but at least you'll be able to see me over the podium!<br>
<br>
Being at this convention, I am amazed to stop and think how much the Navy... and indeed the entire world... has changed since Admiral Boorda and I were commissioned.<br>
<br>
Who would have dreamed back in 1963 that 33 years later...<br>
<br><ul>
<li>-- The Cold War would be over, and the threat of nuclear war would be greatly reduced?
<li>-- That the United States and Russia, once Cold War rivals, would become partners in carrying out combined disaster relief exercises off the coast of Hawaii?
<li>-- And that Russian ships would make a first-ever port visit to pearl harbor?
<li>-- Who would have guessed the impact that computers would have on every aspect of our lives?
<li>-- Who could have predicted, not just that Japan would become a great economic power, but that other east and southeast Asian economies would experience such exponential growth?
</ul>
The world today is in a rapid state of flux... So as we try to define the threats that the Pacific Fleet and the U.S. Navy will face over the next 30 years, we are left with a great deal of uncertainty.<br>
<br>
But yet we build our ships to serve us for 30-40 years... The carrier Midway, for example, served for 46 years until her retirement just a few years ago.  The A-6 was introduced into the Navy the same year I was commissioned in 1963... And the P-3 has been with us since 1961!<br>
<br>
So this afternoon, as a lead-in to the panel discussion on future international threats,  I would like to discuss some of the knowns and unknowns about the future in the Pacific... And will share with you what I, as the Fleet commander -- and therefore the customer of new technologies -- would like to see in future technologies... many of which you will no doubt help create.<br>
<br>
First, there are many uncertainties confronting us, but there are some known events... And I would like to set the stage by addressing some things that we know about the next 30 years.<br>
<br>
We know that Asia and the Pacific Rim will be a very important part of the world to the United States... There are 3 million American jobs directly dependent upon trade with Asian nations today... And that will grow to 6 million over next decade!  Over 200,000 American sons and daughters have been lost to conflict in this region during this century... And 9 million Americans of Asian or Pacific ancestry give us strong emotional ties to the region as well.<br>
<br>
Next, we know that computers and information technologies will be an integral part of warfighting... And just about everything else in the world.<br>
<br>
We know that demand for the earth's natural resources will continue to grow as its population increases... Which could lead to conflict.  The oil we have easy access to today will be a resource of competition with other Asian nations within the decade.<br>
<br>
We know that the vastness of the Pacific will continue to be an important factor for forward naval presence in the western Pacific and Indian ocean.  Even if we develop ships that can steam at 50 knots, deployments to Arabian gulf from the continental U.S. will still take nearly 10 days!<br>
<br>
We know that Asia will always have strategically important sea-lanes... The straits of Hormuz, Lomboc, Malacca and Tsushima to name just a few.<br>
<br>
We know that Hong Kong will revert to China 18 months from now.<br>
<br>
We know that the Arabian gulf region will continue to supply most of the world's fossil fuels.<br>
<br>
We know that Asia will likely continue to be one of the most well-armed corners of the world neighborhood... It presently has 7 of the 9 largest militaries in the world, the world's 2 largest armies, and 7 of the 10 largest submarine forces.<br>
<br>
We know that Asia will always be rife with historical tensions... Some so old and severe they make Bosnia look like childhood squabbling.<br>
<br>
Now those are a few of the items that we know... But there's even more that we don't know about the next 30 years.<br>
<br>
We don't know the future of the Korean peninsula... Will Korea ever reunite... And if so, what will post-unified Korea be like?<br>
<br>
We don't know which direction China will take... Will it continue its drive for a blue water Navy?  What will happen in Hong Kong after 1997?  What will China do regarding Taiwan and the Spratly Islands?<br>
<br>
We don't know Russia's political future... Although the Cold War is over, Russia still retains considerable naval capabilities that we must watch.<br>
<br>
We don't know the likelihood of continued U.S. access to forward basing... a crucial ingredient to maintaining a robust forward presence in the region.<br>
<br>
We don't know the future resolution of disputes between nations such as India and Pakistan.<br>
<br>
We don't know if weapons of mass destruction will proliferate throughout the region.<br>
<br>
We don't know what or who our future threats will be in Asia and the Pacific.<br>
<br>
We must consider these uncertainties as we plan new technologies for the future.  Smart ships... Arsenal ships... F/A-18 E/F's... New attack submarines... Open architecture communication systems... Wide area networks... Flagships with greater C4I capabilities... These are the warfighting tools which we are building today for an uncertain tomorrow.<br>
<br>
As the Fleet commander -- and therefore the customer of your technologies today -- I would like to share my perspective on what I believe is needed in these new technologies.<br>
<br>
First, your U.S. Navy's Pacific Fleet needs technologies which can be implemented quickly.  I was reading the other day that the average retail life for consumer electronics is just over 90 days... That's 90 days from the time a new product hits the shelf until it is made obsolete by a newer and more technologically advanced product!  Fortunately military technology doesn't change that fast... But it does move quickly.<br>
<br>
The process of acquisition and implementation must be done quickly and efficiently in order for us to keep the technological edge.  That means, wherever feasible and lawful, we must decentralize procurement to the Fleet level and even waterfront level.<br>
<br>
We cannot plan for, procure, and pay for new technologies in the future the way we bought new technologies in the past.  We don't have time to set up a program office and wait for 2 to 3 years until the technology is implemented... because it will be obsolete by the time it is!<br>
<br>
I'll give you an example (pull out GPS receiver)... This is a Garmin-40 hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver.  It's not much bigger than a Sony Walkman... and it gives you your exact position in longitude and latitude down to a few meters -- incredible technology.  It has numerous applications for drivers, campers, boaters and civil engineers, to name but a few.  But it could also be very useful to us in the Navy... We could put them in our landing craft... Give it to our SEAL's... Put them in our aircraft.<br>
<br>
But as incredible as this is, it's probably going to be obsolete in a few years... replaced by something the size of a wristwatch, with perhaps even greater accuracy.  We in the Fleet need to be able to purchase these quickly, and implement them into use while they're still cutting-edge technology.  And replace them quickly with newer technologies when they become available.<br>
<br>
One new program in its infancy... its first year... is NTIP -- Naval Technology Insertion Program.  It's an approach to rapid technology insertion that is managed by the Fleet community -- the customer -- instead of the procurers in D.C.<br>
<br>
NTIP makes me -- the Fleet commander -- the executive agent to buy mature technologies and rapidly insert them into use.  We purchase a mature technology -- say, for instance, a P-3 ESM suite -- which was developed but not POM'ed in the budget... We purchase one, decide how we want to use it, where we WANt to use it, and what tests we want to run... If we like it, we go back to the procurers in Washington and request more... And if we don't like it, we cancel it and we're not saddled with an unrelenting profusion of follow-on P-3 ESM suites.<br>
<br>
From my point of view, makes a lot of sense because it eliminates a number of steps in the middle... And we ultimately get new technology implemented more quickly.  It's still a "small bucks" program... $9 million this year... but is a step in the right direction towards streamlining acquisition and technology implementation.  And with technology changing as rapidly as it is, this is just the sort of innovation that will help us maintain our edge tomorrow in a world of uncertain threats.<br>
<br>
The second thing that I as the customer need in new technologies is the ability to upgrade.  I need the ability to replace individual components of systems as technology changes... without replacing the entire system.<br>
<br>
My wife can replace her old 486 processor with a Pentium chip on her computer without fanfare... But we in the Navy often seem unable to replace even a mouse without a 4 month study! We should strive to use modular inserts in ship and aircraft construction, designed to be pulled out and upgraded easily every couple of years... Because a couple of years today represents an entire generation in computing!<br>
<br>
This is all a part of what we call "open architecture"... Eliminating the "stovepipes" which used to restrict our connectivity -- and our upgradability -- in the past.  The best way to ensure we can upgrade easily is to use systems built of replaceable components made from commercial, "off-the-shelf" technology wherever possible.<br>
<br>
We obviously cannot do this with everything... Very few off-the-shelf computers are battle survivable and EMP hardened! (...but they may not have to be.)  And the majority of our technological applications aren't operational... They're administrative and routine.<br>
<br>
We're doing this with our CINCPACFLT wide area network -- or "WAN". We have established a secure "WAN" from my headquarters in Hawaii to the west coast of the U.S., Washington D.C. and Norfolk to the east... 10,000 miles across the Pacific to Japan and the 7th Fleet staff onboard USS Blueridge (afloat) in the western Pacific.  It was built entirely with commercial, off-the-shelf technology.  And because our WAN is componentized, we can easily upgrade it as technology changes (and, believe me, it will change!).<br>
<br>
So whether we're building a wide area network, making a replaceable guidance system on a missile, or just putting PC's in our offices... We need systems which we can upgrade easily, and which have removable components that can be replaced as they become obsolete.  This will be increasingly important in the future as we face a world of uncertain threats.<br>
<br>
Third and finally, we need technologies which allow us to upgrade our people.  By that I mean we need to employ new systems to hone the combat skills of our Sailors and Marines... Employing simulation and stimulation to make them sharper and more combat-ready.<br>
<br>
I'm not talking about the flight simulators in which I trained 30 years ago... Or even the elaborate team trainer simulators we've used for several years now for training CIC watch teams.<br>
<br>
I'm talking about technology that lets us conduct large Fleet-level exercises... Technology that allows entire combat teams, from multiple units, to work complex problems together spanning several time zones.<br>
<br>
With limited resources, we cannot always afford to get a full contingent of ships underway and aircraft in the air... So we will increasingly rely on virtual reality technologies to coordinate large-scale exercises involving many units.<br>
<br>
A great example of this was exercise Kernal Blitz last year off the coast of Camp Pendleton. It involved a carrier battle group, an amphibious ready group and a contingent of Marines.  The problem was we had no submarines available to play.<br>
<br>
So we put the crews of two submarines into simulators -- one in San Diego, one in new London -- and wired them into the exercise. 
As far as the crews were concerned, they were underway in their "virtual submarines", off the coast of San Clemente island, guarding the transition of Marines ashore.<br>
<br>
It was interesting to talk to the crew afterwards... They were really jazzed about the exercise.  Even though they weren't underway, they had gotten many of the same stimulations as if they had been.<br>
<br>
In the future we will rely more and more on the ability to take a ship that's out to sea, transfer the data coming from its radar and sonar to a team in another location, and let them be stimulated by that data.  One team solves the same problem that another ship is solving hundreds of miles away... With both real and simulated data.<br>
<br>
In a time of shrinking defense budgets, technology which allows for virtual training of our people is one way in which our Fleet can retain its edge in combat-readiness.<br>
<br>
So that's what I -- the Fleet commander and customer -- would like to see in the future:  rapid technology insertion, the ability to upgrade, and technologies which hone our people's skills.<br>
<br>
So much has changed since my early days in the Navy... Flying A-6's over Vietnam was a relatively simple process compared to what today's strike missions involve.<br>
<br>
In those days, a bombing mission would involve taking off from the carrier, flying to the target and dropping 15 - 1000 pound bombs.  With UHF line of sight comms, we couldn't abort or change the mission once over the horizon... And the ability to be warned of threats in midflight was very limited.<br>
<br>
Today, the same mission would involve incredible complexity.  We have far fewer aircraft and far fewer weapons to deliver, but they all have the potential to be delivered precisely, which is vital because they may cost $1 or $2 million each.  We must have the capability in mid-strike to change our mind, and modify route, target or egress... And the capability to do battle damage assessment immediately.  We have to deal with coordination with joint and coalition forces, and comply with air tasking orders that are longer than Tolstoy's War and Peace.  And we have a C4I network to support the pilot... Giving her a bubble in the sky which our pilots have never had before.  We have national sensor data downlinked directly to the pilot providing a full air picture as he or she flies in.<br>
<br>
If that's how complex a strike mission has become in 30 years, what will it be like 3 decades from now in 2025?  Being able to adapt our Fleet to missions of increasing complexity... in a world of uncertain threats... is what we need to strive for.<br>
<br>
But with the outstanding young men and women we have serving today... And the new innovations that people like you will work on... I am optimistic we can maintain our forward presence in the Pacific for years to come -- despite having a smaller overall force.<br>
<br>
I know that today's panel discussion will be fruitful and inspire ideas that we can put to use.  I'd like to stick around and participate, but have to be at the opening ceremony for the rear Admiral Roberta Hazard Center in half an hour... But I will return and I look forward to hearing a full report about your discussions.<br>
<br>
Thank you and God bless you all.<br>

<h1>Ford Island Causeway<br>Groundbreaking Ceremony</h1>
<h2>Remarks as prepared for<br>Admiral R. J. Zlatoper, USN<br>
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Pearl Harbor, Hawaii (Wednesday, January 10, 1996)</strong><br><br>
Governor Cayetano, Admiral Macke, Admiral Hayes, General Lum, and many other distinguished guests ... aloha and good morning.  I'm pleased to take part in this historic event.  When planning began to build the Ford Island causeway, I was a young Lieutenant J.G. flying the A-6 Intruder's first combat missions over Vietnam from a Pacific Fleet aircraft carrier. <br>
<br>
Today I'm Commander in Chief of that Fleet, the A-6 is being retired, and we finally are breaking ground for the causeway.  Don't let it be said that we rush into such important projects without doing our homework! <br>
<br>
That we are here at all, even after 30 years, is a real tribute to the unique ties between the U.S. Navy and Hawaii.  This project reflects the support of the state's congressional delegation, led by Senator Inouye. <br>
<br>
Sharing the credit is the government of the State of Hawaii, led now by our distinguished guest speaker, Governor Cayetano, whom I'll be introducing in a moment.  And we must thank the City of Honolulu and the county for their cooperation in the real estate transaction that finally made it possible to move this causeway from the drawing board to this ground-breaking. <br>
<br>
This causeway will form yet another link, physically and spiritually, between the Navy and Hawaii.  I know Admiral Macke and others in uniform today would join me in saying that I am very proud of this positive relationship, and grateful for it.<br>
<br>
Hawaii is one of the very few places in the U.S. where the local share of the shrinking defense pie has actually increased, while other bases are closing around the U.S. and overseas. <br>  
<br>
Some would say that's no surprise when you consider Hawaii is strategically located at the hub of this vibrant Pacific region.  But there is more to it than that, as we scale back our activities in other strategic locations such as San Francisco and Guam.  Besides its location, the leaders and citizens of Hawaii offer a very special spirit of cooperation, support and friendship. <br>
<br>
And the participation of our guest speaker in today's ceremony is evidence of the unique partnership between the Navy and the State of Hawaii. <br>
<br>
The Honorable Benjamin Cayetano is a graduate of Farrington High School, UCLA, and Loyola Law School.  He practiced law in Hawaii for 15 years, and served 12 years in the state legislature before being elected Lieutenant Governor in 1986.  He was elected Hawaii's fifth governor in 1994. <br>  
<br>
In his distinguished career as a public servant, he has been a proponent of numerous military initiatives... including this causeway project.   More than that, he has been a friend to our Sailors and their families, and we all thank you for that support, sir. <br>  
<br>
It's my great pleasure to introduce Governor Benjamin Cayetano...<br>

<h1>Presentation of<br>Legion of Merit<br>to Admiral Fukuchi</h1>
<h2>Remarks as prepared for<br>Admiral R. J. Zlatoper, USN<br>
Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet</h2>
<hr>
<strong>CINCPACFLT Headquarters, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii (Tuesday, November 14, 1995)</strong><br><br>
Aloha and good morning.  Usually when we gather here for these ceremonies, it is to honor members of our staff... but this morning we are here to honor a very special individual who is not a member of our staff, or even of our military.  But the efforts of Admiral Takeo Fukuchi have made a positive impact on our entire Navy in the Pacific, and have contributed to the strong relationship which exists between the United States and Japan.<br>
<br>
For this special occasion, we are very pleased to have some other distinguished guests with us here today...  Consul General Amae of Japan...  Ms. Kathy Matsunami, Associate Director of the Japan-America Society of Hawaii... Walter Saito, Executive Director of the Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii... Bruce Koppel, Vice President of the East-West Center... and Admiral Clarey and other retired Flag and General officers from the Hawaii area who are here for a conference hosted by CINCPACFLT.<br>
<br>
All are here this morning to help us pay tribute to a man who, throughout his career, has helped foster good relations between the U.S. and Japan.  But before I talk about Admiral Fukuchi, I'd like to talk about the unique relationship that exists between our two nations.  Japan and the United States are two of the world's most powerful democracies... with the world's two largest economies.  We share a common goal of seeing prosperity and freedom flourish around the globe... and by working together, we have made real progress towards achieving these goals. <br>
<br>
Our cooperative efforts have helped resolve regional conflicts, guaranteed freedom of the seas, and reduced the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  And even more importantly we have promoted democracy, respect for human rights, and free markets. <br>
<br>
It's important to remember that the Asia-Pacific region has no NATO-like security structure.  We rely on our strong bi-lateral relationships to maintain stability in this vibrant region.  Without a doubt, the most important of those bi-lateral relationships is our relationship with Japan.  Our economies are intertwined with one another... We are enamored of each other's cultures... And we share a strong partnership for peace in the form of our Mutual Security Treaty. <br>
<br>
If there is one part of our security relationship with Japan that best defines our friendship and partnership, it is without a doubt our navy-to-navy relationship.  If you were to line up a Japan Maritime Self Defense Force officer alongside a U.S. Navy officer, the only difference is that the JMSDF officer would have a <em>sakura</em> blossom where the American officer has a star.  We're almost identical in every other way... our education, our training, our tactics, our system of rank and promotion, our staff organization structures... and our values:  love of our country, personal honor, and devotion to duty. <br>
<br>
These similarities make it easy for us to be interoperable, and that allows for seamless operations with each other... like we'll see next year during RIMPAC '96... or any of our numerous bi-lateral exercises each year.  Even as we speak, we have three separate exercises ongoing with the JMSDF... and the JDS Kirishima -- Japan's second Aegis cruiser -- is exercising off of PMRF in Kauai.  Just a typical day for our navy-to-navy relationship with Japan... and a strong symbol of our friendship.<br>
<br>
One of the biggest advocates of our mutual partnership is Admiral Takeo Fukuchi... an long time friend of mine, going back eight or nine years to my days in Yokosuka on the Seventh Fleet staff.<br>
<br>
Since taking over as JMSDF Chief of Staff almost a year ago, Admiral Fukuchi has been a real partner to the U.S. Pacific Fleet.  He has been the architect of new and improved bonds of friendship and cooperation between the United States Navy and the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force... enhancing fleet interoperability, promoting bilateral planning, and confidently charting the course for our mutual maritime relations.  He understands that the relationship between our two nations, and especially between our two navies, is more important than ever in this dynamic and unpredictable post-cold war era. <br>
<br>
I am proud of our partnership, and I am pleased to call Admiral Fukuchi <em>tomodachi</em>... my "friend". <br>

<h2><center>USS INDEPENDENCE Battle Group<BR>Ends Deployment</center></h2>
<title>CV-62 Ends Deployment</title>
</center>
<hr>
The forward deployed aircraft carrier USS INDEPENDENCE (CV 62) and members of Carrier Group FIVE, along the Aegis Cruiser USS BUNKER HILL (CG 52), returned from a three-month deployment to the Arabian Gulf and western Pacific Ocean to their homeport of Yokosuka, Japan Wednesday, November 8th.<BR>
The Guided Missile Frigate USS CURTS (FFG 38) also returned fom the gulf and is currently participating in the joint U.S./Japan exercise "ANNUALEX" off the coast of Japan.  INDEPENDENCE and BUNKER HILL will be joining CURTS in ANNUALEX later this month.  Two other battle group ships, uss mobile bay (cg 53) and USS FIFE (DDG 991) remain in the Arabian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch.
;Highlights during the deployment included Helicopter Anti-Submarine Warfare Squadron 14 and crew members of uss mobile bay (cg 53) providing medical assistance and emergency helicopter transportation to a Spanish seaman, and Carrier Air Wing FIVE (I-5) recording the 337,000 arrested landing on board INDEPENDENCE, a record among active U.S. aircraft carriers.<BR>
The I-5 team didn't stop there.  Setting the example for high-tempo flight operations, INDEPENDENCE and Carrier Air Wing FIVE logged more than 3,500 landings and achieved a more than 99 per cent sortie completion rate.<BR>
"Logging this many landings and being able to launch aircraft as scheduled 99 per cent of the time, is a tribute to the special working relationship between independence and Air Wing FIVE," said CAPT Brian Calhoun, Commander, Carrier Air Wing FIVE, of  Eau Claire, Wisconsin.  Calhoun also pointed out the contributions of Fighter Squadron TWENTY ONE, which will decommission January 12, 1996after more than 52 years of
distinguished service flying every major U.S. navy fighter from The Hellcat to the Tomcat.<BR>
The value of joint operations was proven in late September when INDEPENDENCE completed a successful "dry hook-up" replenishment at sea with the Canadian Patrol Frigate HMCS
Calgary.  "with NDEPENDENCE's ablility to refuel at sea, both countries are able to react more quickly to any threat they may encounter," said INDY Commanding Officer CAPT David P. Polatty, III, of Annapolis MD.<BR>
In October, the staff of Destroyer Squadron FIFTEEN, the primary anti-air and sub-surface defense for Carrier Group FIVE, departed INDEPENDENCE after completing Arabian
Gulf operations.  Upon embarking in USS HEWITT (DD 966), DESRON FIFTEEN served as surface warfare commander during Exercise Foal Eagle, a combined exercise with The Republic of Korea designed to enhance rear area defense of the Republic of Korea.<BR>
According to CAPT Robert E. Smith, Commander, Destroyer Squadron FIFTEEN, U.S. and ROK forces work exceptionally well together and form a very credible deterrent to aggression.<BR>
The native of New York City said exercises like Foal Eagle "Keep Destroyer Squadron FIFTEEN's skills honed and enable us to complete our surface warfare mission."<BR>
As a member of Destroyer Squadron FIFTEEN, USS CURTS' deployment featured six maritime interception operations, one boarding and the diversion of a ship laden with illegal cargo bound for Iraq.  While all of these events supported UN sanctions
enforcement and Operation Southern Watch, the environmental highlight of the  deployment was the rescue of 10 sea turtles trapped in an abandoned fishing net.<BR>
While transiting the Indian Ocean on October 17, the crew of CURTS' SH-60B helicopter discovered a group of 10 sea turtles hopelessly entangled in an abandoned fishing
net.  The ship altered course to render assistance to the sea turtles, launched the ship's small boat and succeeded in cutting the turtles free.  The story of this rescue received national and international media attention.<BR>
USS BUNKER HILL, which celebrated its ninth birthday September 20th, served as the Battle Group's area air defense commander (AADC).  As AADC for the entire over-water gulf region, BUNKER HILL ensured that a unified tactical air "picture" was transmitted and relayed between units across approximately 9,000 square miles.<BR>
"We took our assignment as a regional warfare commander very seriously.  The ship's performance in area airspace management was virtually flawless," said BUNKER HILL Commanding Officer CAPT G. W. Schnurrpusch.   As the primary anti-air warfare (AAW) naval unit in the gulf, BUNKER HILL also managed the air battlespace for more than 700 Navy tactical air sorties.<BR>
During the deployment, USS INDEPENDENCE made port calls to Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates; and Hong Kong, while USS BUNKER HILL made port calls to Manama, Bahrain; Jebel Ali, U.A.E; and Hong Kong.  USS CURTS made port calls to Bahrain; Muscat, Oman; and Phuket, Thailand.<BR>
While in port, INDEPENDENCE and BUNKER HILL crewmembers participated in community relations projects with their host countries.   INDEPENDENCE crewmembers assisted in the refurbishing of two children's homes, one in the United Arab Emirates and one in Hong Kong, and painted a women's home in Hong Kong.  Meanwhile, BUNKER HILL crewmembers hosted 30 students and faculty members for a ship's tour in the United Arab Emirates.<BR>
Throughout the deployment, the INDEPENDENCE Battle Group continued to meet all of its commitments while evading a nearly endless stream of powerful tropical storms.<BR>
Heading to the Arabian Gulf, the Battle Group avoided Tropical Storm Janice.  On the return trip to Japan, Tropical Storm Zack forced the Battle Group to revise its Manila port call to Hong Kong, only to depart Hong Kong ahead of schedule to avoid Super-Typhoon Angela.<BR>
As the Battle Group proceeded to its homeport in Yokosuka, Japan, Commander, Carrier Group FIVE Rear Admiral James O. Ellis Jr. said, "Whether this battle group is in Jebel Ali, or off the coast of Japan, Carrier Group FIVE will continue to show our allies and potential aggressors that well trained and capable forward deployed naval forces can always be  counted on to promote peace and stability wherever they go."

<title>Nimitz Battle Group Deployment Begins</title>
</center>
<hr>
Over 10,000 Sailors and Marines from numerous Pacific naval commands will deploy to the Arabian Gulf November 27, 1995 as part of the Nimitz Battle Group.  The deployment is expected to last for six months.  Comprised of 9 ships and 10 aircraft squadrons, the Battle Group is commanded by Rear Admiral Lyle G. Bien, Commander, Carrier Group Seven.<br>
During the deployment, the Nimitz Battle Group will join forces with the PELELIU
Amphibious Readiness Group and their embarked Marines of the 15th
Marine Expeditionary Unit which deployed November 13, 1995.  Carrier
Battle Groups have been deploying with Amphibious Readiness Groups
due to a fundamental change in Navy warfighting strategy entitled
"Forward . . . From the Sea." &nbsp;In the past, single Carrier Battle
Groups would typically deploy to open ocean areas providing power
projection and air support to sea and land targets distant from the
Battle Group.  Today, with the addition of Marines and amphibious
assets, the combined group routinely operates more closely to the
shore where power projection in support of U.S. forces ashore can be
more efficiently conducted.<br>
This long-scheduled deployment is routine and not in response to any specific crisis.<br>
The forces of the Nimitz Battle Group include the following ships:<br>
<ul><li>USS NIMITZ (CVN 68), a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier homeported in Bremerton, WA.  NIMITZ is commanded by Captain Al Harms, Jr. and serves as the flagship for RADM Bien and the Commander, Destroyer Squadron TWO THREE, Commodore Barry Costello.
<li>USS PORT ROYAL (CG 73), commanded by Captain Nick Richards, is a
newly commissioned Aegis cruiser homeported in Pearl Harbor, HI.
<li>USS OLDENDORF (DD 972), a destroyer homeported in San Diego, CA, is
commanded by Commander Mark Nesselrode.
<li>USS CALLAGHAN (DDG 994), a Guided Missile Destroyer homeported in San Diego, CA, is commanded by Commander James Wisecup.
<li>USS FORD (FFG 54), a frigate homeported in Everett, WA, is commanded by Commander Ken Trass.
<li>The battle group includes two Nuclear-powered submarines, USS PORTSMITH (SSN 707) and USS BIRMINGHAM (SSN 695).  PORTSMITH is commanded by Commander Dick Corpus and is homeported in San Diego, CA. BIRMINGHAM, homeported in Pearl Harbor, HI, is commanded by Commander Mark Kenny.
<li>Two combat logistics ships, USS SHASTA (AE 33) and USS WILLAMETTE (AO 180) are commanded by Commander Norman Laws, Lr. and Commander Norma Hackney, respectively.  SHASTA is an Ammunition Ship homeported in Concord, CA. WILLAMETTE, a fleet oiler, is homeported in Pearl Harbor, HI.
<li>Carrier Air Wing NINE, commanded by Captain John Worthington,
is embarked on USS NIMITZ and includes 10 squadrons.  Three squadrons
are homeported at Miramar Naval Air Station, CA.  Fighter Squadrons 24
and 211, flying the F-14a Tomcat, are commanded by Commander Robert Wilson
And Commander Gerald Beaman, respectively.  Airborne Early Warning Squadron 112, flying the E-2C-plus Hawkeye, is commanded by Commander Brian
Roby.  Strike Fighter Squadrons 146 and 147, flying the F /A-18
Hornet and commanded by Commander Raymond Zack and Commander Robert Rutherford, respectively, are homeported in Lemoore, CA.  Flying the EA-6B Prowler, Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 138 is commanded by Commander James Seagle and is homeported at NAS Whidbey Island, WA.  Also homeported at Whidbey Island, Attack Squadron 165, flying the A-6E
Intruder, is commanded by Commander Mark Needler.  Four squadrons are
homeported at NAS North Island, CA.  Helicopter Anti-Submarine
Squadron EIGHT, flying SH-60 and HH-60 helicopters, is commanded by
Commander Terrence Doyle.  Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 5, Detachment Charlie, flies the ES-3A and is commanded by &nbsp;Lieutenant Commander Andy Eddowes.  Sea Control Squadron 33, flies the S-3B Viking and is commanded by Commander Jeff Dickman.  Flying the C-2 Greyhound and commanded by Lieutenant Commander Rick Nichols, Fleet Logistics Support Squadron THREE ZERO, Detachment FOUR, will also be onboard.</ul>
NIMITZ last deployed in February 1993 and spent most of that deployment in the Arabian Gulf supporting United Nation's policy by enforcing the no-fly zone in southern Iraq as part of Operation Southern Watch.<br>
When NIMITZ returned to Bremerton in August 1993, she completed a nearly year-long overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.   The Battle Group has completed a comprehensive training cycle which began in February 1995 and included nearly 150 days at sea preparing for this deployment.<br>

<h2>Dead Horse</h2>
When a Sailor pays off a debt to the command (advance pay, overpayments, etc...) they say they've paid off a Dead Horse.  The saying comes from a tradition of British sailors.
<p>British seamen, apt to be ashore and unemployed for considerable periods of time between voyages, generally preferred to live in boarding houses near the piers while waiting for sailing ships to take on crews.  <p>During these periods of unrestricted liberty, many ran out of money, so innkeepers carried them on credit until hired out for another voyage.
<p>When a seaman was booked on a ship, he was customarily advanced a month's wages, if needed, to pay off his boarding house debt.  Then, while paying back the ship's master, he worked for nothing but "salt horse" the first several weeks aboard.
<p>Salt horse was the staple diet of early sailors and it wasn't exactly tasty cusine.  Consisting of a low quality beef that had been heavily salted, the salt horse was tough to chew and even harder to digest.
<p>When the debt had been repaid, the salt horse was said to be dead and it was a time for great celebration among the crew.  Usually, an effigy of a horse was constructed from odds and ends, set afire and then cast afloat to the cheers and hilarity of the ex-debtors.

<h2>Manning The Rails</h2>
<p>This custom evolved from the centuries old practice of "manning the yards."  Men aboard sailing ships stood evenly spaced on all the yards and gave three cheers to honor a distinguished person.
<p>Now men and women are stationed along the rails of a ship when honors are rendered to the President, the heads of a foreign state, or a member of a reigning royal family.  Men and women so stationed do not salute.
<p>Navy ships will often man the rails when entering a port, or when returning to the ship's homeport at the end of a deployment.

<h1><center>Naval Tradition:<br>Gun Salutes</center></h1>
<title>Navy History/Tradition/Customs</title>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Gun Salutes</h2>
In the days of cannon, it took as long as twenty minutes to load and fire a gun.  When a ship fired her guns in salute, she rendered herself powerless for the duration.  By emptying their guns, the ship's crew showed shore batteries and forts that they were no threat.  Over time, this gesture became a show of respect, with both shore and ship gun batteries firing volleys.<p>
While many people like to say the 21 gun salute was a tribute to the American Revolution, a number determined as a result of adding together the numbers 1+7+7+6, the truth is the 21 gun salute was an effort to cut costs.  The habit of firing salutes became wasteful, with ships and shore batteries firing shots for hours on end.  This was particularly expensive for ships, which had a limited space to store powder (which went bad quickly in the salt air).  The British admiralty first dictated the policies now in place as a practical matter to save gunpowder.  The rule was simple, for every volley fired by a ship in salute, a shore battery could return up to three shots.  The regulations limited ships to a total of seven shots in salute, so the 21 gun-salute became the salute used to honor the only the most important dignitaries.<p>
Today, the U.S. Navy Regulations proscribe that only those ships and stations designated by the Secretary of the Navy may fire gun salutes.  A national salute of 21 guns is fired on:
<ul>
<li>Washington's Birthday</li>
<li>Memorial Day</li>
<li>Independence Day</li>
<li>To honor the President of the United States</li>
<li>To honor heads of foreign states.</li>
</ul>
Additionally, ships may, with approval from the office of the Secretary of the Navy, provide gun salutes for naval officers on significant occasions, using the following protocol:

Admiral-17 guns
Vice Admiral-15 guns
Rear Admiral (upper half)-13 guns
Rear Admiral (lower half)-11 guns

All gun salutes are fired at five second intervals.  Gun salutes will always total an on number.

<h2>Bell-bottom Trousers</h2>
The Sailor's bell-bottom trousers, which came to epitomize '60s and early '70s fashion, are actually a practical item for Sailors living aboard ship.  The wide, flared, legs are easy to roll up when swabbing a deck or wading through slightly flooded spaces.<br><br>

<h1><center>Naval Tradition:<br>Ornimental Sleeve Buttons</center></h1>
<title>Navy History/Tradition/Customs</title>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Ornamental Sleeve Buttons</h2>

The decorative bone buttons that are today sewn on many suit jackets, sports coats and blazers began as an effort by Lord Nelson to keep young midshipsmen and cabinboys from wiping their noses on their sleeves.<p>
In the days of sail, young boys, often as young as nine years old, would sign on sailing ships as cabinboys, usually becoming midshipmen as they got older.  Many, particularly on their first voyages, would become homesick, tearfully tending to their duties in their fancy gentlemen's uniform.  That uniform had no pockets for a hankerchief, so the young boys would, like all young boys, wipe their noses on their sleeves.<p>
To break his cabinboys and midshipmen of this ungentlemanly habit, Lord Nelson had large brass buttons sewn on the sleeves of all midshipmen and cabinboy uniforms.  The decorative value of the buttons were soon realized, and in short order, London tailors were adding decorative buttons to frocks, coats, and dinner jackets.  Though the buttons have become less gaudy, the practice continues.<p>

<h2>Sally Ship</h2>
"Sally ship" was not a ship but a method of loosening a vessel that ran aground from the mud holding her fast.  In the days before sophisticated navigation equipment, ships ran aground much more often than today.  A grounded ship could be freed with little or no hull damage if she could be rocked out of her muddy predicament.<br>
To free her, the order was given to "sally ship".  The crew gathered in a line along one side and then ran from port to starboard and back and forth until the vessel began to roll.  Often the rolling broke the mud's suction and she could be pulled free and gotten underway.<br>

Side boys are a part of the quarterdeck ceremonies when an important person or Officer comes on board or leaves a ship.  Large ships have side boys detailed to the quarterdeck from 0800 to sunset.  When the side is piped 
by the BMOW, from two to eight side boys, depending on the rank 
of the Officer, will form a passageway at the gangway.  They 
salute on the first note of the pipe and finish together on the 
last note.<br>
In the days of sail, it was not uncommon for the Commanding Officers of ships sailing in convoy to convene aboard the flagship for conferences.  It was also not uncommon for COs to invite each other to dine aboard their vessels.  Unfortunately, there was no easy way to bring visitors on and off a ship while underway.  And there was no dignified may for a high ranking officer to scurry up or down a rope ladder hanging down the side of a ship.  Often the boatswain's chair, a rope and wood sling, would be used to hoist the guest onto and off the ship.  The Boatswain's Mate would control the heaving by blowing the appropriate commands with a whistle known as a Boatswain's Pipe.  The number of "strong backs" needed to bring the visitor aboard depended upon the size of the "load" being hoisted.  Somewhere along the line, it was noted that the more senior the visitor's rank, the more Sailors were needed to "man the side."<br>
Over time, the need to hoist visitors onto and off of Navy ships went away, but the custom of mustering the Sideboys and piping distinquished visitors aboard ship remains.<br>

Commissioned ships are "full-dressed" on Washington's Birthday and 
Independence Day, and "dressed" on other national holidays.  
When a ship is dressed, the national ensign is flown from the 
flagstaff and usually from each masthead.  When a ship is full-
dressed, in addition to the ensigns, a "rainbow" of signal flags 
is displayed from bow to stern over the mastheads, or as nearly 
so as the construction of the ships permits.  Ships not under way 
are dressed from 0800 to sunset; ships under way do not dress 
until they come to anchor during that period.<br>

<h2>Marooned</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old punishment for mutineers consisted of placing them on an island with musket, cutlass, and a breaker of water; and leaving them to their fate. &nbsp;It got its name from a certain Ci-maroon Indians who had been transplanted in the West Indies as cheap labor and, deserted by their Spanish masters, had been left to starve to death. &nbsp;The famous Captain Drake discovered them in a pitiable condition and gained the Indian's lasting gratitude by returning them to their far-off home.

<h2>Passing Honors</h2>
Passing honors are ordered by 
ships and boats when vessels, embarked officials, or embarked 
officers pass (or are passed) close aboard - 600 yards for ships, 
400 yards for boats.<p>
Such honors are exchanged between ships of the U.S. Navy, between ships of the Navy and the Coast Guard, and between U.S. and most foreign navy ships passing close aboard.  "Attention" is 
sounded, and the hand salute is rendered by all persons in view 
on deck (not in ranks).<p>

<h2>Dungarees</h2>
Webster defines dungaree as "a coarse kind of fabric worn by the poorer class of people and also used for tents and sail."<BR>
We find it hard to picture our favorite pair of dungarees flying from the mast of a sailing ship, but in those days Sailors often made both their working clothes and
hammocks out of discarded sail cloth.<BR>
The cloth used then wasn't as well woven nor was it dyed blue, but it served the purpose. Dungarees worn by Sailors of the Continental Navy were cut directly
from old sails and remained tan in color just as they been when filled with wind.<BR>
After battles, it was the practice in both the American and British Navies for Captains to report more sail lost in battle than actually was the case so the crew would
have cloth to mend their hammocks and make new clothes. Since the cloth was called dungaree, clothes made from the fabric borrowed the name.

<h2>Fathom</h2>
Fathom was originally a land measuring term derived from the Anglo-Saxon word "faetm" meaning literally the embracing arms, or to embrace.  In those days, most measurements were based on average sizes of parts of the body, such as the hand or foot, or were derived from average length between two points on the body.<br>
A fathom is the average distance from middle-fingertip to middle-fingertip of the outstretched arms of a six-foot tall man.  Even today in our nuclear Navy, Sailors can be seen "guess-timating" the length of line by using the Anglo-Saxon fingertip method; crude but still reliable.<br>

<h2>Boatswain & Coxswain</h2>
As required by 17th Century law, British ships-of-war carried three smaller boats, the boat, the cock-boat, and the skiff.  The boat - or gig - was usually used by the Captain to go ashore and was the larger of the three.  The cock-boat was a very small rowboat used as the ship's tender.  The skiff was a lightweight all-purpose vessel.  The suffix "swain" means keeper, thus the keepers of the boat, cock, and skiff were called boatswain and cockswain (or coxswain).<br>

<h2>Bully Boys</h2>
Bully boys, a term prominent in Navy chanties and poems, means in its strictest sense, "beef eating Sailors."  Sailors of the Colonial Navy had a daily menu of an amazingly elastic substance called bully beef, actually beef jerky.  The term appeared so frequently on the messdeck that it naturally lent its name to the sailors who had to eat it.<br>
As an indication of the beef's texture and chewability, it was also called "salt junk," alluding to the rope yarn used for caulking the ship's seams.<br>

<h2>Mind Your P's and Q's</h2>
There are few of us who at one time or another have not been admonished to "mind our P's and Q's," or in other words, to behave our best.  Oddly enough, "mind your P's and Q's" had nautical beginnings as a method of keeping books on the waterfront.<br>
<br>
In the days of sail when Sailors were paid a pittance, seamen drank their ale in taverns whose keepers were willing to extend credit until payday.  Since many salts were illiterate, keepers kept a talley of pints and quarts consumed by each Sailor on a chalkboard behind the bar.  Next to each person's name, a mark was made under "P" for pint or "Q" for quart whenever a seaman ordered another draught.<br>
<br>
On payday, each seaman was liable for each mark next to his name, so he was forced to "mind his P's and Q's" or he would get into financial trouble.  To ensure an accurate count by unscrupulous keepers, Sailors had to keep their wits and remain somewhat sober.  Sobriety usually ensured good behavior, hence the meaning of "mind your P's and Q's."<br>

<h2>Bitter End</h2>
As any able-bodied seaman can tell you, a turn of a line around a bitt, those wooden or iron posts sticking through a ship's deck, is called a bitter.  Thus the last of the line secured to the bitts is known as the bitter end.  Nautical usage has somewhat expanded the original definition in that today the end of any line, secured to bitts or not, is called a bitter end.<br>
<br>
The landlubbing phrases "stick to the bitter end" and "faithful to the bitter end" are derivations of the nautical term and refer to anyone who insists on adhering to a course of action without regard to consequences.<br>

<h2>Gundecking</h2>
In the modern Navy, falsifying reports, records and the like is often referred to as "gundecking."  The origin of the term is somewhat obscure, but at the risk of gundecking, here are two plausible explanations for its modern usage.<br>
<br>
The deck below the upper deck on British sailing ships-of-war was called the gundeck although it carried no guns.  This false deck may have been constructed to deceive enemies as to the amount of armament carried, thus the gundeck was a falsification.<br>
<br>
A more plausible explanation may stem from shortcuts taken by early Midshipmen when doing their navigation lessons.  Each Mid was supposed to take sun lines at noon and star sights at night and then go below to the gundeck, work out their calculations and show them to the navigator.<br>
<br>
Certain of these young men, however, had a special formula for getting the correct answers.  They would note the noon or last position on the quarter-deck traverse board and determine the approximate current position by dead reckoning plotting.  Armed with this information, they proceeded to the gundeck to "gundeck" their navigation homework by simply working backwards from the dead reckoning position.<br>

<h2>Chewing the Fat</h2>
"God made the vittles, but the devil made the cook," was a popular saying used by seafaring men in the last century when salted beef was staple diet aboard ship.<br>
<br>
This tough cured beef, suitable only for long voyages when nothing else was as cheap or would keep as well, required prolonged chewing to make it edible.  Men often chewed one chunk for hours, just as if it were chewing gum and referred to this practice as "chewing the fat.".<br>

<h2>The Lucky Bag</h2>
The so-called Lucky Bag was really a huge locker in which articles lost aboard ship were deposited.  Once a month these articles were produced and handed back to their respective owners.  But there was a catch to it...each lucky recipient of a lost article was then given three strokes from the cat-o'-nine tails to teach him not to lose anything again.<br>

<h2>Jacob's Ladder</h2>
Jacob's Ladder is a portable ladder made of rope or metal and used primarily as an aid in boarding a ship.  Originally, the Jacob's Ladder was a network of line leading to the skysail on wooden ships.  The name alludes to the biblical Jacob, reputed to have dreamed that he climbed a ladder to the sky.<br>
<br>
Anyone who has ever tried climbing a Jacob's Ladder while carrying a seabag can apreciate the allusion.  It does seem that the climb is long enough to take one into the next world.<br>

<h2>Log Book</h2>
Today, any bound record kept on a daily basis aboard ship is called a "log."  Originally, records were kept on the sailing ship by inscribing information onto shingles cut from logs and hinged so they opened like books.  When paper became more readily available, "log books" were manufactured from paper and bound.  Shingles were relegated to naval museums but the slang term stuck.<br>

<h2>Wardroom</h2>
The Wardroom originally was known as the Wardrobe Room, a place where officers kept their spare wearing apparel.  It was also the space where any loot secured from enemy ships, was stored.  In an effort to have some privacy on a crowded ship, officers would sometimes take their meals in the Wardrobe Room.  Today, the wardroom aboard ship is where officers take their meals, relax, and socialize.

<h2>Dog Watch</h2>
Dog Watch is the name given to the 1600-1800 and the 1800-2000 watches aboard a ship.  The 1600-2000 four-hour watch was originally split even to prevent men from always having to stand the same watches daily.  As a result, Sailors dodge the same daily routine, hence they are dodging the watch or standing the dodge watch.<br>
<br>
In its corrupted form, dodge became dog and the procedure is referred as "dogging the watch" or standing the "dog watch."<br>

<h2>Skylarking</h2>
Originally, skylarking described the antics of young Navy men who climbed and slid down the backstays for fun.  Since the ancient word "lac" means "to play" and the games started high in the masts, the term was skylacing."  Later, corruption of the word changed it to "skylarking."<br>
<br>
Skylarking is a familiar term to most Sailors and a popular pastime for others.  Today, it is generally looked upon with disfavor both onboard ship and ashore.<br>

<h2>The Superstition of Friday</h2>
The reluctance of seaman to sail on a Friday reached such epic proportions, that many years ago the British Government decided to take strong measures to prove the fallacy of the superstition.  They laid the keel of a new vessel on Friday, launched her on a Friday and named her HMS Friday.  They then placed her in command of one Captain Friday and sent her to sea on Friday.  The scheme worked well, and had only one drawback...neither ship nor crew were ever heard from again.<br>

<h2>Yankee</h2>
Americans are known by their nicknames from Hong Kong to Timbuktu; one of the most widely used is "yankee." It's origin is uncertain but one belief is that it was given to us by the early Dutch.<br>
<br>
Early American sea captains were known but not revered for their ability to drive a hard bargain.  Dutchmen, who were also regarded as extremely frugal, jokingly referred to the hard to please Americans as "Yankers" or wranglers. The nom de plume persists to this day.<br>

<h2>Binnacle List</h2>
Many novice Sailors, confusing the words "binnacle" and "barnacle," have wondered what their illnesses had to do with crusty growths found on the hull of a ship.  Their confusion is understandable.<br>
<br>
Binnacle is defined as the stand or housing for the ship's compass located on the bridge.  The term binnacle list, in lieu of sick list, originated years ago when ships' corpsmen used to place a list of the sick on the binnalce each morning to inform the Captain about the crew's health.  After long practice, it came to be called the Binnacle List.<br>

<h2>Carry On</h2>
In the days of sail, the Officer of the Deck kept a weather eye constantly on the slightest change in wind, so sails could be reefed or added as necessary to ensure the fastest headway.  Whenever a good breeze came along, the order to "carry on" would be given.  It meant to hoist every bit of canvas the yards could carry.  Pity the poor Sailor whose weather eye failed him and the ship was caught partially reefed when a good breeze arrived.<br>
<br>
Through the centuries the term's connotation has changed somewhat.  Today, the Bluejackets Manual defines "carry on" as an order to resume work -- work not so grueling as two centuries ago.<br>

<h2>The Attack on Pearl Harbor</h2>
<strong>(December 7, 1941)</strong>--At 0755, Sunday morning, the Pacific Fleet was attacked by Japanese torpedo-bombers, dive-bombers, and fighters from Japanese carriers while the U.S. fleet was at anchor in Pearl Harbor.
<p>The Japanese concentrated on the battleships anchored off Ford Island.  Among them is the battleship USS ARIZONA (BB 39), which is destroyed by a bomb that detonates her forward magazine, killing 1,103 of the 1,400 men aboard.

<h2>April 1, 1945: Operation Iceberg -<br> the Invasion of Okinawa</h2>
As a staging area for the anticipated invasion of Japan, American forces plan to seize Okinawa in the Rykus, some 325 miles south of Kyushu, nearest the enemy's home island.  A narrow, mountainous island, 60 miles long and from 12 to 18 miles in width, Okinawa is garrisoned by more than 115,000 Japanese troops.  Shunning the traditional Japanese strategy of attempting to repel an invasion at the water's edge, Japan has concentrated their forces in the rocky southern third of the island.  The invasion, the largest and most complex of the Pacific war, is conducted by Admiral Ray Spruance's FIFTH Fleet.  The U.S. landing force consists of more than 183,000 men, and encounters little resistance during the first three days after the landing.  On April 4, 1945, U.S. troops which have wheeled south, come up against Japan's Machinato Line.  &nbsp;The battle for Okinawa had begun.  Over the next three months of fighting, kamikaze attacks claimed 34 U.S. ships, damaging 288 others.  Japan lost 1,228 planes in the battle.  When the battle ended on July 2, 1945, 12,000 Americans were dead and 36,000 had been wounded.  Japan lost 100,000 soldiers in the battle.<br>

<h2>Doolittle's Raid On Tokyo</h2>
18 April 1942. Halsey-Doolittle Raid. At 0824, Vice Admiral W. F. Halsey's Task Force 16 launches a very special air raid. Sixteen twin-engined B-25 bombers commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James H. Doolittle, USA, take off from the deck of Captain Marc A. Mitscher's carrier, USS HORNET (CV 8), to strike the first blows against the Japanese homeland. Tokyo, Yokohama, Kobe, and Nagoya are bombed. The B-25s fly on to China, where most reach friendly lines, only two crews being captured. The psychological effect of the raid is disproportionate to the relatively minor damage it does. The American people are thrilled that, after so many disasters, their armed forces have begun to hit back; the Japanese navy is deeply chagrined
that it has failed to keep the Home Islands safe from attack.

<h2>Battle of Coral Sea</h2>
<strong>(May 4-8, 1942)</strong>--Japanese forces suffer their first strategic defeat of World War II when the Pacific Fleet codebreakers at Pearl Harbor learn of a plan to seize Port Moresby, on the southeastern coast of New Guinea, and the island of Tulagi in the Solomons.<br>
The Tulagi landing is unopposed, but Rear Admiral Fletcher's Task Force 17, formed around USS LEXINGTON (CV 2) and USS YORKTOWN (CV 5), is on hand to intercept the Japanese units that enter the Coral Sea.<br>
The resulting action is the first carrier air battle ever fought and the first battle in Naval history where the combatant ships never came within sight of each other.<br>

<h2>Battle of Midway</h2>
<strong>(June 2-6, 1942)</strong>--Admiral Yamamoto launched an operation designed to extend the Japanese defensive perimeter by seizing the island of Midway.  He believed that an attack on Midway will bring the American carriers out to be destroyed, completing the job begun at Pearl Harbor.<br>
Before the Battle of Midway, the Japanese had an advantage in every class of vessel, from carriers (8-3), battleships (7-0), to destroyers (55-33).<br>
This advantage didn't take them very far.<br>
In Pearl Harbor, Commander Joseph J. Rochefort's code breakers decoded the Japanese battle plans.  The key to this codebreaking included a little bit of trickery by U.S. codebreakers.  The codebreakers knew the Japanese were preparing to capture an island but they were unable to figure out which island.  All they had was a codename.  Midway was given instructions to send an uncoded message about a fictional problem at the water treatment plant.  The next day the Japanese reported on the island's water problems, using their codename for Midway island.  Now that the U.S. knew which island, setting a trap for Yamamoto's forces was easy.<br>
In the course of a day's furious fighting, planes from American carriers sank all four of the carriers assigned to Vice Admiral Nagumo's Carrier Strike Force.  This battle became the turning point in the war with Japan in the central Pacific.<br>

<h2>July 6, 1943:<br>The Battle of Kula Gulf</h2>
Around mid-afternoon on July 5th, the Third Fleet learned that a "Tokyo Express" is enroute South from Bougainville with Japanese reinforcments for the Central Solomons.  Rear Admiral Walden L. "Pug" Ainsworth's Task Group 36.1, consisting of his flag ship, the light cruiser USS HONOLULU (CL 48), additional light cruisers USS HELENA (CL 50) and USS ST. LOUIS (CL 49), and four destroyers, makes full speed to Kula Gulf to intercept the Japanese.<br>
<br>
It meets the enemy force -- ten destroyers, seven of which are being used as transports, under Rear Admiral Teruo Akiyama -- a few minutes past midnight.  In a confused action that lasts almost until dawn, Admiral Akiyama's flagship, the NIIZUKI, is sunk and another Japanese ship, the NAGATSUKI, driven ashore, where she is destroyed by U.S. planes.<br>

<h2>July 16, 1953:<br>Navy Ace</h2>
Obsolete North Korean aircraft have begun nighttime, nuissance raids on Seoul.  These planes, derisively known as "Bedcheck Charlies," fly so slowly and at such low altitudes that Fifth Air Force jets are unable to intercept them.<br>
In June, a detachment of Navy night pilots and four F4U-5N Corsairs are lent to the Air Force to counter the raids. Between June 29 and July 16, Lieutenant Guy P. Bordelon destroys five Charlies, thus becoming the only Navy Ace of the Korean Conflict and the first Navy Nightfighter Ace ever.<br>

<h2>July 26, 1953:<br>The Philippines or Formosa?</h2>
President Roosevelt met with General MacArthur and Admiral Nimitz in Honolulu to discuss the next steps in the war against Japan. Nimitz presented Admiral King's view that the Central Pacific drive should continue to Formosa.  However, both he and the President are convinced by MacArthur's argument that moral as well as military grounds dictate the United States proceed at the earliest possible moment to liberate the Philippines, with successive landings on Mindinao, Leyte and Luzon.<br>
<br>
The Joint Chiefs of Staff take longer to make up their minds.  The invasion of Mindinao and Leyte is not authorized until September, and the question of whether to go on to Luzon or Formosa remains unsettled until then.<br>

<h2>October 6-7, 1943:<br>Battle of Vella LaVella</h2>
Another night action takes place in the Solomons when the Japanese send a force of nine destroyers and 12 small craft under Rear Admiral Matsuji Ijuin to evacuate the 600 troops on Vella LaVella.  It is intercepted by six destroyers commanded by Captain Frank R. Walker.<br>
<br>
One destroyer is sunk on each side -- USS CHEVALIER (DD 451), commanded by Lieutenant Commander George R. Wilson, and HIJMS Yugumo -- plus two American destroyers are damaged.  The Japanese small craft extricate the island's garrison.  This is the last engagement fought in the central Solomons.<br>

<title>USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) hosts visitors during embark</title>

<h1>USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) hosts visitors during embark</h1>
<h2>by JO3 Jon Saltzgiver<br>
Pacific Fleet Public Affairs</h2>
<hr>
<strong>(Aboard USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63), June 21, 1996)</strong>-- Flight operations, spectacular views of Hawaii and a visit by the Pacific Fleet commander highlighted a day at sea when Sailors aboard USS Kitty Hawk (CV 63) hosted 1,500 Navy League members attending their national convention, and more than 200 Navy Junior Recruit Officer Training Candidates (NJROTC), Sea Cadets and others on June 21.<br>
<a href="daddeck.htm"><img src="daddeck.gif" alt="Dad and Son On-Board USS Kitty Hawk" align="left" height=254 width=391></a>
In Hawaii for RIMPAC 96 with five other navies, Kitty Hawk offered a special opportunity for league members attending their annual national convention, which was held this year in Waikiki June 18-22.<br>
“Just being onboard the Kitty Hawk is an education in itself,” said Jim Pitton, the executive director of the Navy League’s Honolulu Chapter. “Here you have kids mostly who are in their early 20s launching multi-million dollar airplanes and handling weapons and just seeing how professional they are amazes you.”<br>

<a href="hilndemo.htm"><img src="hilndemo.gif" alt="Marines Fast Rope Onto USS Kitty Hawk" align="left" height=254 width=391></a>

During the eight-hour trip, visitors were given ship tours by the crew, observed demonstrations of firefighting gear aboard the ship and a display of guns used by the ship’s Marine detachment.  The weapons ranged from a pistol and a shotgun to the military’s newest belt-fed machine gun.<br>
Three hours into the voyage, the commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Adm. Ronald Zlatoper, arrived by helicopter with a special guest, retired Capt. Gerald Coffey, a former Vietnam prisoner of war.<br>
Coffey, who was shotdown shortly after taking off from this same carrier during the Vietnam war commented, “I’ve always said the Kitty Hawk owed me a landing.”<br>
This day, that debt was paid.<br>
Coffey joined the other guests on the flight deck to witness the Navy’s most sophisticated aircraft hurtle off the deck. F-14 Tomcats, F/A-18 Hornets, S-3 Vikings and other aircraft were launched and recovered a short distance from the enthralled crowd.  <br>

<a href="flyover.htm"><img src="flyover.gif" alt="Carrier Air Wing 11 demonstrates Navy air" align="left" height=247 width=400></a>

“It looks different in real life compared to the way it looks in the movies,” said Joyce Clark, president of the Long Beach, Calif. chapter of the Navy League, and a first time visitor aircraft carrier. “Seeing the planes take off in front of you gives it a more personal touch to what happens in real life and, it helped me better understand what goes on up here.”<br>
“It’s amazing to see how quickly the planes took off from the ship,” said Stanley Bednar Jr., an NJROTC student from Anchorage, Alaska. “They look slower when you see this sort of thing on television, and seeing the real thing happen makes it look more impressive.”<br>

<a href="collis.htm"><img src="collis.gif" alt="Retired Pearl Harbor CO Visits USS Kitty Hawk" align="left" height=320 width=250></a>

The trip also showed how far the Navy and technology have advanced over the years, Navy League members were quick to point them out.<br>
“From an operational and readiness standpoint, it hasn’t changed that much at all,” said Don Clark of the Long Beach, Calif. Navy League Chapter and a retired Navy captain.  “The Sailors aboard our ships today are better prepared and qualified.”<br>
He added, “The Navy is more mechanized and that enables the ships to use somewhat less manpower to get the job done,” <br>
For John Stephens of the Pensacola, Fla., Navy League Chapter, only one thing seemed different from when he retired from the Navy in 1965.  <br>
“The only thing that I have seen that looks different on this trip is the fact that women are now stationed aboard the ship,” Stephens said. “It’s good to see that there is now an opportunity for everyone aboard an aircraft carrier.”<br>
Everyone packed the hangar bay for a buffet breakfast and lunch while members of the Pacific Fleet Band performed.<br>
Throughout the day, they were able to purchase souvenirs from the carrier and its airwing -- from baseball hats and boxer shorts to photographs and Zippo lighters.<br>
Adm. Zlatoper also presented awards to NJROTC students from around the western United States during a short ceremony in the hangar.<br>
“It was nice of him to take time out of his busy schedule to come to our graduation,” said James M. Sneed, one of the NJROTC students from Eagle River, Alaska, “it was a really big honor.”      <br>
<a href="zapjrotc.htm">
<img src="zapjrotc.gif" alt="CINCPACFLT Presides Over JROTC Graduation Ceremony" align="left" height=247 width=400></a>

After the ceremony, Adm. Zlatoper used the ship’s announcement system to thank the Navy League and the other guests for coming on board.  <br>
He also thanked the crew of the Kitty Hawk for their hard work and extra effort for hosting the guests and their successful completion of their participation in RIMPAC 96.<br>
“It’s evident that you all worked very hard to prepare the ship for this event,” he said. “You have a lot of reasons to be proud and I thank you for all your efforts.”<br>
He added, “I know that all the Navy Leaguers and special guests we have aboard join me in thanking you not only for your performance but also for your warm hospitality.”<br>
After returning the guests to Pearl Harbor the Kitty Hawk returned to its homeport of San Diego.<br>
Navy League Convention Chairman Dick Fahrenwald of the Hawaii Chapter summed up the experience by asking, “What do we do for an encore?”<br>

<title>"SALTS" KEEPS SUPPLIES FLOWING</title>
<h1>"SALTS" Keeps Supplies Flowing</h1>
<h2>By JO1 Catherine Kurchinski</h2>
<hr>
<strong>PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii, June 21, 1996</strong> -- Without supplies and repairs parts, U.S. Navy ships would be "dead in the water."<br>
That's why the Navy depends on SALTS -- Streamline Automated Logistics Transmission System -- a computer software system that processes supply orders for the fleet.  Everything from paper clips to power tools are ordered via the computer.<br>
<a href="satdish.htm"><img src="satdish.gif" alt="Electronics Tech Repositions Dish" align="left" height=266 width=400></a>
Helping to keep the logistics pipeline flowing for the largest naval exercise in the Pacific -- Exercise Rim of the Pacific, RIMPAC '96 -- are two Naval Reserve SALTS units, one based in Pearl Harbor, and the other in San Diego (Supporting the Atlantic Fleet are two Naval Reserve SALTS units on the East Coast, one in Norfolk, and one in Philadelphia.)<br>
With more than 40 ships from six Pacific nations involved in RIMPAC '96, including the U.S., Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan and the Republic of Korea, reservists are playing key roles in the exercise.<br>
"When a ship in the fleet has a problem with their SALTS system, we provide support," said Electronic Technician 1st Class Wayne Waffird, a reservist assigned to SALTS Detachment 120, Pearl Harbor.  "During RIMPAC, we helped the USS Independence and  USS Kitty Hawk with their SALTS systems."<br>
State-of-the-art technology is used to transmit information to ships at sea, said Waffird.  "We have an international marine satellite terminal that we use to send e-mails.  When the  USS Kitty Hawk had a problem with their software, we sent them a fix via E-mail."<br>
RIMPAC, conducted every two years, improves coordination and interoperability of joint forces in maritime tactical and theater operations.  More than 40 ships front six Pacific nations, including U.S., Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan and the Republic of Korea were involved in this year's exercise.<br>

<title>RIMPAC Sailors Lock Horns in Sports Tourney Finals</title>
<h1>RIMPAC Sailors Lock<br>
Horns in Sports<br>
Tourney Finals</h1>
<h2>by JO2 James E. Scott</h2>
<hr><br>
<strong>Pearl Harbor, HI (June 20, 1996)</strong> -- Hearts pounded, teeth gnashed and muscles flexed during last weekÕs final phase of  the 1996 RIMPAC Sports Tournament.<br>
Teams from Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Korea, and the U.S. clashed in a myriad of events ranging from basketball to volleyball, all sponsored by MCI.<br>
Sailors from USS Kitty Hawk (CV 63) dominated the tournament, but the men of USS Chosin (CG 65) stood their ground to protect the "home turf" in the softball competition.<br>
"These tournaments get bigger every year," boasted Frank DelGaudio, Fleet Recreational Coordinator. "This year, we had more participants than ever."<br>
DelGaudio credits the turnout to the large amount of  publicity the tournament received. "I personally want to thank the recreation officers for keeping their individual units informed about the events. They really got things cooking."<br>
<a href="runner.htm"><img src="runner.gif" alt="Running On Empty" align="right" height=246 width=400></a>
A total of 405 runners competed in the 5K RIMPAC Fun Run.<br>
When the starting pistol fired, the screaming horde sprung forward like a savage beast lunging for the kill. But, it was Lt. Doug Ebbers, an H-65 helicopter pilot from Coast Guard Air Station, Barbers Point, who first crossed the finish line, with a time of 16:25.<br>
"I was very excited about the race," exclaimed Ebbers. "When I looked around at the other participants, I saw that there was a wide variety of talent.<br>
My initial strategy was to stay in pace with the lead runners. But after a quarter-mile, I felt pretty good, so I broke away from the pack, and set my own pace.<br>
"I had just placed 5th in the Hard Rock Cafe 5K Fun Run the previous week," he added, "and I was still quite sore. But, I gave it all I had, and won. It was nice to come in first for a change."<br>
In team sports, the men of USS Kitty Hawk seem determined to make their mark. In basketball action, they slam-dunked their way through the 39-teamm competion to squeak by USS Essex (LHD 2) 44-43 in the championship game.<br>
Kitty Hawk showed their strength again in soccer, as they kicked their way through the 39-team bracket to a 3-1 victory over USS Independence (CV 62).<br>
<a href="vball.htm"><img src="vball.gif" alt="BUMP...There It Is" align="left" height=444 width=300></a>
And, in indoor volleyball competition, the "Hawk's" men tore through the 21-team roster to trample JDS Yuugiri (DD 153) 15-4, 15-4 in the final match.<br>
Even in tennis, Kitty Hawk proved unstoppable as Ensign Matt Kowalsky aced his way through 59 other players, to win with a score of 6-1, 6-2 in the final.<br>
But in the softball arena, the "Hawk" met its match. The sweltering heat only seemed to feed the fire of USS Chosin's War Dragons, who scorched their way through the 58-team, single-elimination tournament to decimate the Kitty Hawk 12-2 in the final game.<br>
The War Dragons, who were leading the intramural league with a record of 19-1, were well-prepared to slug it out.<br>
"We really put our hearts and souls into the final competition," declared Operations Specialist 1st Class Johnny L. Graves, coach of the champion War Dragons. "Our motto is 'never give up.' From player one to the three extra guys on the bench, everyone got involved.<br>
"Our strength lies in our defense," he bragged. "A lot of teams hit better than us, but we have some of the best defense on the island.<br>
"We come from a ship of 400, so our selection is limited; the Kitty Hawk has over 5,000, so they pretty much have pick of the litter. It was a challenge, but we dived in headfirst, and came out on top."<br>
In other sports action, USS Coronado  (AGF 11) proved to be the best of 35 teams in the 4-man sand volley ball contest, smoking USS Chosin 11-9, 11-6 to take the championship.<br>
All in all, some 3,400 participants competed in this second phase of RIMPAC sports events.<br>
"I think this says something about the camaraderie that exists between the navies of the world," concluded DelGaudio. "This is a great opportunity for shipmates from around the world to get together and compete in a friendly atmosphere, and unwind a little bit."<br>

<title>MARINES OPPOSE RIMPAC AMPHIB LANDING</title>
<h1>On the Other Side:<br>
Marines Oppose RIMPAC 96<br>
Amphib Landing</h1>
<h2>By JO2 José V. Tolentino</h2>
<hr>
<strong>BARKING SANDS, Kauai, June 20, 1996</strong> -- While US Marines are usually on the offensive, Kaneohe-based India Company, Third Battalion, Third Marines, recently played the opposition force during RIMPAC.<br>
<a href="lookout1.htm"><img src="lookout1.gif" alt="On the Lookout for Invading Forces" align="left" height=269 width=400></a>
Company Commander Captain Steven M. Neary and his 87 Marines played the role of a fictitious enemy for a simulated amphibious assault at PMRF (Pacific Missile Firing Range), here, on June 15.  The event served as the climax for the maritime training exercise RIMPAC 96.<br>
The Essex Amphibious Task Group (ATG), led by the helicopter carrier/assault ship USS Essex  (LHD 2), included the landing assault craft USS Cleveland (LPD 7), and USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 49).  They launched the amphibious force from the Camp Pendleton, California-based 11th MEU (Marine Expeditionary Unit).<br>
Given the invaders' overwhelming numerical and technological superiority one would think that Neary's young "Devil Dogs" would have fled with their tails between their legs upon being designated as the exercise's opposing force.  Such was not the case with these stalwart defenders.<br>
<a href="warning1.htm"><img src="warning.gif" alt="Sending Out the Signal: Enemy Forces Approach" align="right" height=450 width=300></a>
Neary was elated over the opportunity presented to him and his rifle company to portray a fictitious enemy nation.<br>
"This amphibious landing is wonderful practice in preparing them for upcoming deployments,"  he said, the day prior to the assault.<br>
Corporal Jacob D. Butz 's enthusiasm for his company's role in the scenario stemmed from slightly different reasons.<br>
Because he and his fellow Marines were portraying an undisciplined enemy country, they were not required to maintain the usual Marine Corps discipline and decorum.<br>
"It's a nice break from the norm," the 20 year old Montvale, NJ native said. "We get to wear civilian attire, act crazy and go swimming."<br>
"If this were a real Marine scenario, and my men were portraying themselves," Neary explained, "we would have mined the beaches first and then moved into the mountains.<br>
"The amphibious assault is the 'bread-and-butter' of the Marine Corps; we were the ones who invented it.  I would not want to be in the real-life role of the enemy country."<br>
But that was not the case that early Saturday morning when the amphibious assault scenario began.  Neary's men faced "bombardment" by both air and water from the oncoming invaders.<br>
After the invasion force determined that the Neary's defenders were put out of action, it then proceeded to unleash more than several waves of landing craft and air-cushioned assault vehicles.<br>
<a href="cleangun.htm"><img src="cleangun.gif" alt="Always Being Ready Means Having a Clean Gun" align="left" height=450 width=300></a>
These well armed forces steamrolled their way through the beach defenses, and proceeded to disgorge their fearsome cargo of men and tanks at various points along the invasion front.<br>
The assault exercise lasted for about four hours.  Neary's defenders, although exhausted by the oppressive heat and seemingly endless waves of landing craft and enemy tanks and men, did come away with a renewed appreciation of their service branch's trademark mode of attack.<br>
"This exercise was definitely useful in our overall training," said Lance Corporal. Michael R. Brown, a 20 year old native of Virginia.  "The toughest thing about it was the hot weather, the sand's bad effect on our weapons, and the chance of getting dehydrated."<br>
The scenario also provided Neary's men useful insight into the invasion force's skill in executing its assault.<br>
"Those guys were coming off the tracs (landing craft) too slow," remarked Kansas native Lance Corporal Ryan G. Dixon. "They were too laid-back and slow in their attack.  They should have come out harder and more aggressive.
"But, if there was something that they did right, it would be that they coordinated the communication between their people very well."<br>
"This exercise was definitely a benefit for us," Neary said.  "It was good to have been able to assume a different role, rather than just being the aggressor all the time, and constantly being evaluated.<br>
"It also reaffirmed the Marine Corp concept of the individual Marine and his importance to the Marine on his right and left during wartime."<br>

<title>RIMPAC TESTS MARINE INTERDICTION CAPABILITIES</title>
<h1>RIMPAC Tests Marine<br>
Interdiction Capabilities</h1>
<h2>By JO1 Andy Wellman</h2>
<hr>
<strong>MARINE CORPS BASE HAWAII, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, June 17, 1996</strong> -- In the era of wooden ships  when one vessel wanted to stop another from aiding hostile or unfriendly forces it would simply approach to within range and fire a broadside.<br>
<a href="miohline.htm"><img src="miohline.gif" alt="Marines High-Rope to the Deck" align="left" height=448 width=300></a>
Today, things have changed.  Sanctions and embargoes are measures most commonly used to force unfriendly nations to yield to treaty and trade agreements. Sometimes however, like in the  days of old, navy ships are called  on to stop and search vessels on the high seas.<br>
In a common scenario, a Naval warship would hail a ship suspected of carrying contraband  cargo, an inspection would then be agreed to and a boarding party sent in.  Depending on the outcome of  the search, the ship would be detained or allowed to continue.<br>
If the ship's captain was uncooperative and refused to be boarded, a shot across the bow or a flyover by armed aircraft might be called for.  Sometimes though, more "hands-on" measures are necessary.<br>
One such last-ditch measure to stop a ship at sea is to place specially-trained Marines and SEALs onto the deck with orders to take control of the crew, secure the bridge and take charge of engineering and communications spaces.<br>
A Marine Interdiction Operation (MIO) is a well-planned, unbelievably fast evolution that can place nearly 50 heavily-armed,  highly-trained Force Reconnaissance  Marines and Navy SEALs on the deck of a moving ship in a matter of minutes.<br>
RIMPAC '96 , a multinational military exercise recently concluded in and around the Hawaiian Islands, tested the skills required to perform such an interdiction in a highly life-like environment.<br>
Marines from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit from Camp Pendleton, Ca. and SEALs from Naval Special Warfare Training Unit 3, NAB Coronado, Ca. assigned to Amphibious  Squadron 5 began the RIMPAC MIO exercise embarked from the Amphibious Assault Ship USS Essex (LHD-2).  Essex was accompanied by the Dock Landing Ship USS Harpers Ferry (LSD-49) and the Amphibious Transport Dock Ship USS Cleveland (LPD-7).<br>
<a href="hangar.htm"><img src="hangar.gif" alt="Marine Carefully Inspects Hangar" align="right" height=450 width=300></a>
The target vessel was the Military Sealift Command Fleet Oiler USNS Walter S. Diehl (T-AO 193).<br>
Suspected of violating a simulated U.N. resolution  by transporting contraband, the oiler was asked to submit to an inspection by U.S. forces.<br>
For more than an hour, talks continued between the Harpers Ferry and the oiler.  Despite helicopter flyovers and continued requests to cooperate, the captain refused  to stop.<br>
Soon, two Harrier attack jets from the Essex were screaming past the oiler's bow shooting flares to create a diversion for what was to come.  Just minutes later, the first of four Sea Knight transport helicopters was hovering above the ship.<br>
Within seconds masked shock troops were sliding down a rope from an opening in the helicopter's fuselage.  The first Sea Knight was followed by three others each "fast roping" troops to the ship's deck.<br>
As each troop hit the deck, he immediately performed a specific task.  Some were lookouts, watching out for any activity considered to be a threat. Others made their way to the vital spaces of the ship.<br>
Space by space, the entire ship was searched, documents were photographed and the contraband cargo was confiscated.<br>
For the purposes of RIMPAC, Marines and Navy stand-ins were used to portray the sailors of the Diehl's predominantly civilian crew.<br>
After they were quickly overpowered and restrained, Marines and SEALs searched the ship. During the entire mission, armed helicopters provided air cover for the MIO invaders while the Harpers Ferry and Cleveland stayed in close proximity.<br>
Within an hour of subduing the ship and crew,  the mission was accomplished and the troops were readied for their return to ESSEX.  This time, each helicopter was able to land on the deck and the troops filed onboard.<br>
Though it was practice this time, such interdictions have been conducted nearly 9,800 times since the Gulf  War, all of them real.<br>
"It is exercises like RIMPAC that enable U.S. forces to remain ready and able to respond when called on," said Sgt. Vincent Sabasteanski, an exercise evaluator from the 1st Special Operations Training Group from Camp Pendleton, Ca.<br>

<title>MARINES PERFORM HELO RAID</title>
<h1>Marines Perform Helo Raid</h1>
<h2>by JO2 Dave Kistler</h2>
<hr>
<strong>ABOARD USS ESSEX, Pacific Ocean, June 12, 1996</strong> -- Helicopters buzzed off the coast of  Oahu, setting the stage for  Marines to recover captured cryptological equipment from the Capmid Unification Forces as part of RIMPAC '96.<br>
Marines from the 11th  Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) and the Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron (HMM)-166 reinforced, conducted special urban tactics  at Marine Corps Base Hawaii on the afternoon of June 12th.<br>
Approximately 60 members of Kilo Company, bound for the base, left from USS Essex aboard several CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters  shortly after UH-1N Huey and AH-1W Super Cobra helos conducted assault element maneuvers.<br>
The mission was for the Marines to search for the missing equipment, secure it and return to the ship within a one hour time frame.<br>
<a href="mioload.htm"><img src="mioload.gif" alt="Marines Prepare for Helo Raid" align="left" height=267 width=400></a>
For this scenario, the Hawaiian islands were divided in two, creating the countries of Pacifica and Capmid.   Pacifica was comprised of the islands of Oahu, Kauai, Niihau, and Kuala Rock.  Capmid consisted of the islands of Hawaii, Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe.<br>
The RIMPAC players were divided into bi-lateral and multi-national forces.  The bi-lateral force, located in the western pacific, was composed of the USS Independence Carrier Task Group and the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force.<br>
In the eastern pacific the USS Kitty Hawk Carrier Task Group, Australian, Canadian, Republic of Korea and Chilean forces made up the multi-national force.<br>
Cpl. Chris Corb of Kilo Company 2nd platoon stated, "The assault element goes in first to clear the way, and then the security element will land".  The helos offloaded members of Kilo Company on the landing strip of the base and then enhanced from there.<br>
Corb, a squad leader for the Second Platoon, said, "We moved from building to building, doing things such as room clearing.  Eventually we found the equipment and began to pull back to get picked up by the helos".<br>
Time for this mission was slotted for about an hour and fifteen minutes, but only took the Marines thirty-two minutes.<br>
When asked why this type of  training was so important, the 20 year old Corb stated, "This type of training is done before each deployment.  But mainly they are to help us learn to work together and to know how each other is thinking".<br>
<a href="harrier1.htm"><img src="harrier.gif" alt="Marine Harrier Returns to Deck of USS Essex" align="left" height=448 width=300></a>
He also said, "I like these drills because our leaders can make the simulations as real as possible and still make them safe".<br>
Corb has had first hand experience with these types of missions.  He was part of a actual mission like the simulated one in Somalia.<br>
But unlike Corb, Cpl. Derek Anderson of the First Platoon has never been involved with a real one.<br>
Anderson, a stick leader for his platoon in Kilo Company, said, "I like these training evolutions.  As a stick leader, I'm responsible for four other Marines, making sure they board the helos safely and that their gear is squared away".<br>
He also stated that he likes to have that kind of responsibility.  "Our job is to go into a situation like that and set up security, defense and to quicken response time  for the other elements such as the Landing Craft Air Cushions (LCAC) and the Assault Amphibious Vehicles (AAV)".<br>
Overall, the 24 year old Anderson thought it was good evolution.  "The only thing that surprised us was that the terrain was a little thicker than we thought."<br>
Once the objective is recovered from these types of missions the MEU will return to the ships, check their gear in and get de-briefed.  These evolutions, such as the scenarios played out in RIMPAC '96, are sure to prove to be invaluable.<br>
With the ever changing role of the U.S. military and the seemingly shrinking world environment,  the Marine Corps will undoubtedly be prepared for whatever they are faced with.<br>

<title>Marines make a perfect landing</title>
<h1> Marines Make<br>a Perfect Landing<br>
to Close Out<br>RIMPAC 96</h1>
<h2>By JO1(SW) S.A. Thornbloom</h2>
<hr>
<strong>BARKING SANDS, Kauai, June 18, 1996</strong> -- First, shrill screams filled the clouds.  Then, grinding, clanking sounds rolled in from the sea.  And soon, staccato reports and sulfur smells hung in the early morning air.<br>
Finally, an ominous buzz grew louder and louder as the modern landing craft hit the beach.<br>

<a href="lcacland.htm"><img src="lcacland.gif" alt="LCAC hits the beach" align="left" height=256 width=400></a>

The United States Marine Corps had landed from the sea as part of RIMPAC 96.<br>
The sounds and smells came from Navy F-14s and Marine Corps Harrier jets streaking through the air providing cover, amphibious assault vehicles moving quickly through the soft sand and .50-caliber and 20mm weapons firing blank ammunition.<br>
Meanwhile, the huge helicopter-like propellers of air-cushioned landing craft laden with Marines and equipment took their positions on the Pacific Missile Range Facility's beach property to suppress an insurgent uprising.<br>
Nearly 700 Marines from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) landed in RIMPAC's fictional country of Pacifica to stop rebels from overthrowing the government.<br>
It was all part of the training for the Marines from Camp Pendleton, Calif., and Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, and a chance to show their stuff during a simulation of the possible scenarios the MEU could be ordered to respond to during their upcoming deployment to the Western Pacific.<br>
Real missions in Grenada, Haiti, Somalia and Liberia demonstrate the importance of practice this type of amphibious landing during an exercise such as RIMPAC, according to MEU officials.<br>
"Amphib landings are the bread and butter of the Marine Corps," said Marine Corps Capt. Mark Sojourner, the landing coordinator on shore for 11th MEU.  "It's the reason for being."<br>
Those "from the sea" attacks have been a Navy-Marine Corps specialty since it was developed in World War II.  During that war, amphibious assaults led to victory in the Pacific as Marines charged onto the beaches of Tarawa, Guam, Saipan, Iwo Jima and Okinawa, to name a few.<br>

<a href="lcacload.htm"><img src="lcacload.gif" alt="LCAC off-loads men and machines onto the beach" align="right" height=268 width=400></a>

Gen. Douglas MacArthur turned the tide of the Korean War with a gutsy landing at Inchon in 1951 that liberated Seoul and trapped the North Korean army between two forces.<br>
Successful Marine amphibious landings continue to show the importance of that tactic, even as recently as the 1991 Persian Gulf War, when the Marine Corps feigned an amphibious landing on Falaka Island near Kuwait to confuse Iraqi defenders.<br>
"That (effective feint in Operation Desert Storm) was a big play in allowing the Marines, the Army and other nations' units to be as successful as they were," said Sojourner, an AH-1 Cobra helicopter pilot from Camp Pendleton.<br>
The RIMPAC amphibious landing began very early in the day off Kauai's west coast  with nearly 40 ships from the United States, Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan and the Republic of Korea sailing silently beyond the horizon, preparing for the landing.<br>
RIMPAC is held every two years to improve coordination and interoperability of joint forces in maritime tactical and theater operations.<br>
"The Marines are lucky enough to jump on board (during RIMPAC) and participate with the Navy and all the other nations in the exercise," said Sojourner.<br>
Amphibious landings have always been an "all-Marine show," with the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps working together, he said.  But during RIMPAC, other countries wanted to see how the landing was conducted.<br>
"The other Pacific nations in the exercise are curious about how we do amphibious landings and ask questions, but they don't actually participate in the operation."<br>
Sojourner, who was in charge of setting up the beach for the landing, went on to say, "We have some foreign ships (like HMAS Perth) provide naval gunfire during an assault while the other countries observe.  But these landings are really just the (U.S.) Navy and Marine Corps working in a nice, integrated team to provide an effective fighting force."<br>

<a href="usmcover.htm"><img src="usmcover.gif" alt="Marine on the beach" align="left" height=264 width=400></a>

This scenario included plenty of training for the Sailors aboard the amphibious ships USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 49), USS Essex (LHD 2) and USS Cleveland (LPD 7).  As part of the Amphibious Task Force, each of these vessels had the responsibility to get the MEU into position and quickly dropped-off close to the beach.<br>
The Marines of the MEU and Marines from Kaneohe, who portrayed the rebel force, also said how important the training in RIMPAC has been in preparing them as a cohesive unit for the rest of their deployment.<br>
Lance Cpl. Adam Aldrich of India Company, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines at Kaneohe Bay, served as one of the beach defenders.  The Edmond, Okla., native said he was on the beach to give the MEU some "high-quality training" as they prepare for their West Pac deployment.<br>
Even though his squad of rebels were on a suicide mission by defending the beach against such a large force, the training his team provided to the MEU was invaluable to everyone, he said.<br>
And by portraying "the bad guys," Aldrich's small group got a chance to see what the MEU had to overcome once it hit the beach.<br>
"Through bettering them," he said, "we better ourselves."<br>
Lance Cpl. Daniel Blackwell from Bolingbrook, Ill., agreed with his rebel cohort.<br>
"We're here to aggress the MEU and die," the Kaneohe Marine explained.  "We're helping them in their training by playing the role of a (fictitious) Third World country (called Capmidia).  In that role we have limited weapons and tactics, but we still make them think and react quickly."<br>
With wave after wave of assault vehicles -- amtracks with about 15 "grunts" packed in each -- moving toward the Capmidian rebels, the insurgents were forced to flee and eventually were captured or "killed" and defeated.<br>
The operation was then able to continue unabated as second, third and fourth waves of hovercraft, known as LCACs (Landing Craft Air Cushion), brought the MEU's heavy equipment, including six-wheeled Land Assault Vehicles (LAV) with 20mm cannon and trucks carrying ground-to-air avenger missiles.<br>



<a href="usmcland.htm"><img src="usmcland.gif" alt="Marines get ready to leave after a day at the beach" align="left" height=256 width=400></a>

Sojourner said every MEU has to go through several phases before heading out on deployment.<br>
He referred to the phases as learning to crawl, walk and run, and said participating in RIMPAC was the beginning stage, where the MEU's Marines and Sailors received their initial training on how to properly perform an amphibious landing.<br>
RIMPAC also gives the MEU their first opportunity to conduct a landing, according to Sojourner.<br>
After RIMPAC, the unit then goes right into a fleet exercise.  During this stage, the MEU trains with the fleet as it transits the Pacific.  Sojourner said coordination between the fleet and the MEU is essential.<br>
"They (the Marines) get to do the shipboard procedures (such as planning the different missions) before moving to land," he said.  "The MEU has a designated set of missions they practice.  (On ship) they train and try to improve on  these missions."<br>
The final evaluation, or stage, is the joint task force exercise.  That's where everything is put together for a final grade and the unit looks to be awarded a MEU SOC (Special Operations Capable) designation.<br>
The designation, according to Sojourner, means the MEU is ready to respond to any crisis that may arise while on deployment.<br>
"Giving the MEU an opportunity to practice and train during RIMPAC makes the unit and the Marine Corps a more effective fighting force because of the combined use of arty (artillery), air and naval gunfire all at one time and making sure it's all coordinated," Sojourner said.<br>
For the MEU's few good men, however, the amphibious landing during RIMPAC 96 wasn't just about training-- it was also a pretty big rush.<br>
Lance Cpl. Lynn Berendsen, an amphibious assault vehicle driver from Lawrence, Kansas, said he likes exercises such as RIMPAC because "I get to splash off the ship numerous times and it gives me a huge adrenaline rush every time."<br>

<title>Fleet Mail Center 'Delivers'</title>
<h1>Fleet Mail Center 'Delivers'</h1>
<h2>By JO1 Catherine Kurchinski</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Honolulu, HI, June 14, 1996 </strong> -- 
Neither rain, sleet, nor saltwater keeps the mail from being delivered at sea.<br>
<a href="malhndlr.htm"><img src="malhndlr.gif" alt="Mail Handlers prepare load for delivery to ships" align="left" height=461 width=300></a>
Thanks to the Navy's Fleet Mail Center, based at the U.S. Postal Service Main Office in Honolulu, thousands of  military personnel  involved in the largest naval exercise in the Pacific -- RIMPAC 96 -- are getting their mail on time.<br>
With more than 40 ships from six Pacific nations, including the U.S., Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan and the Republic of Korea, participating in RIMPAC, postal clerks are extra busy.<br>
"Our main goal is service to the fleet," said Postal Clerk 1st Class Sidney Dawson, leading petty officer for the Fleet Mail Center. "We don't let the mail sit around; we get it out as quickly as we can."<br>
Getting the mail out quickly takes teamwork, stressed Dawson. Seven active-duty postal clerks are assigned to the Fleet Mail Center, along with two mail detachments from USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) and USS Independence (CV-63), and three Naval Reserve logistical units based at Hickam Air Force Base.<br>
<br><br><br><a href="indyxprs.htm"><img src="indyxprs.gif" alt="aircrew off-loads mail from Indy Battle Group" align="right" height=268 width=400></a>
The U.S. Postal Service is also pitching in by providing extra equipment, such as forklifts.<br>
"The relationship with the United States Postal Service has been outstanding," said Dawson. "Things run smoothly when you have all the equipment you need."<br>
The Fleet Mail Center sorts, routes and bags the mail for each individual ship. Then it's trucked to a nearby hangar at Hickam Air Force Base where it's loaded on four aircraft,  C-2A Greyhounds. Two detachments from VRC-30 are working around the clock to transport mail, cargo and passengers to the fleet. "We're delivering about 25,000 pounds of mail daily," said Dawson.<br>
<a href="pilot.htm"><img src="pilot.gif" alt="COD pilot gives thumbs up prior to take off" align="right" height=440 width=300></a>
"When they announce 'mail call' on the ship's loudspeaker (1MC), you can hear the rumblings of anticipation," said Yeoman Chief (AW) Daryl Nielsen, administrative chief for VRC-30, Detachment 5, based at Atsugi, Japan.<br>
When RIMPAC 96 ends June 21, the mail will keep on moving.<br>

"During the last RIMPAC we moved 325,000 pounds of mail," said Dawson. "Flexibility is the key to success here; there's no set schedule. We have to be ready on a moment's notice. When the mail comes in, we deliver."<br>

<title>USS RAINIER Plays Key Role During RIMPAC 96</title>
<h1>USS RAINIER Plays Key<br>
Role During RIMPAC 96</h1>
<h2>by JO2 Rita Bargeloh</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Aboard USS RAINIER (AOE-7), Pacific Ocean, June 7, 1996</strong> -- This ship isn't equipped with the latest in sophisticated weaponry.<br>
And you won't see supersonic F-14 Tomcats landing on its deck.<br>
But the fast combat support ship USS Rainier (AOE-7) still plays a vital role in RIMPAC 96 and the fleet.<br>
The Rainier is a one-stop shop from which other ships in the carrier battle group receive everything from bombs and bullets to fuel, food and fresh Sailors.<br>
<a href="aoe7helm.htm"><img src="aoe7helm.gif" align="left" height=275 width=400></a>
The ship, homeported in Bremerton, Wash., is in essence a floating city.  It provides its crew of 579 men and women with a barber shop, laundry facilities, medical and dental care, a post office, a store, eating places, workshops and laboratories.<br>
Also within its 753-foot-long hull, Rainier can store 20,000 gallons of water for its crew, and five 250-ton-capacity air conditioners keep the ship cool while generators supply more than 12.5 million watts of power.<br>
But it is primarily there for others:  Rainier's cargo refrigerators are capable of holding 400 tons of food, and it can store and deliver more than 6.5 million gallons of fuel.  That's enough fuel to fill the average automobile 364,000 times.<br>
It can also carry 1,800 tons of ordnance and 250 tons of non-refrigerated bulk items.<br>
In addition to hauling all those goods on deployment, Rainier must be able to deliver them while on the go.  And that is its main mission:  To conduct prompt underway replenishment operations, or UNREPs, with other ships.<br>
There are basically two ways to accomplish that:  Connected replenishment, or CONREP, where other vessels maneuver alongside Rainier; and vertical replenishments, or VERTREP, where helicopters deliver the goods.<br>
Before vertical replenishment operations, "flight quarters" is announced throughout Rainier to notify crew members that helicopter operations will be taking place on the flight deck and to stay clear of the area.<br>
But Boatswain's Mate 3rd Class Joe Waddell, a native of Gainesville, Fla., is among the Sailors who head to the flight deck just in case.<br>
He's a nozzleman on the flight deck fire party's number one fire hose.<br>
"The fire party's main purpose is to stand by in case of a casualty during flight operations," Waddell said.  "We need to be ready to put the fire out and help injured personnel."<br>
This is Waddell's first major deployment with the ship and his first experience with RIMPAC.<br>
"The hours have been very long -- an average of 10 to 12 hours daily whenever we do vertical replenishment, and sometimes more than that," he said.<br>
Waddell also helps prepare cargo loads so they can be attached to the helicopters and taken to the other ships.<br>
"We work until midnight sometimes just doing that, then get up at 5 a.m. and start all over again," he said.<br>
<a href="aoe7mess.htm"><img src="aoe7mess.gif" align="right" height=261 width=400></a>
According to Rainier's flight deck safety officer, Boatswain's Mate Chief Petty Officer (SW) B. Krause, the ship has done as few as two vertical replenishments a day and as many as 700 in a day.<br>
"Sometimes one lift can be accomplished in under 30 seconds if it's all staged right prior to the lift," he said.  "Since RIMPAC began (on May 17), we've done approximately 1,500 vertical replenishments."<br>
There are just as many dangers during connected replenishments as there are during vertical replenishment, according to Electrician's Mate 1st Class Rollie Jara,  a Hawaii native and one of several on-deck safety supervisors during those operations.<br>
Jara and the other safety supervisors roam among six connected-replenishment stations aboard Rainier to make sure everyone is wearing safety equipment, including hard hats, goggles and life vests.<br>
"My job is to ensure that personnel who operate the winches, which transport the fuel hoses from our ship to the receiving ship, are doing things in a safe manner from start to finish," he said.<br>
One of the most crucial job during an underway replenishment is steering the ship since there's always the danger of a collision -- especially in bad weather.<br>
During underway replenishment, a master helmsman -- someone with at least 200 hours experience at the helm --  is called to steer the ship.<br>
Boatswain's Mate 3rd Class Robert Lekfield is such a Sailor.<br>
"A master helmsman has to keep the course within a half-degree at any time," explained Lekfield, a Tomahawk, Wis., native.<br>
Keeping these large vessels on such a precise, steady path is so difficult -- yet so important -- that Lekfield says he would be replaced with another master helmsman if he got "any more than a half-degree off course."<br>
U.S. Navy regulations state that ships stay 150 to 220 feet apart during an underway replenishment.  But other navies don't follow the same rules.<br>
"I was a little scared the other day when we had an Australian ship come (a little too close) alongside," Lekfield said.  "(But) after our captain told them to slide out a little bit we were fine."<br>
Lekfield has spent about 60 to 70 hours a week steering the ship during RIMPAC 96, but says every day brings a new experience.<br>
"Sometimes the steering wheel feels sluggish, like it doesn't want to cooperate," he said.  "Other times you might get rough seas or calm seas.  Either way, you still have to stay focused."<br>
And either way, with or without the fanfare, the fleet depends on ships like Rainier to keep it in business.<br>

<h1>"Eyes" above<br>
Pearl Harbor<br>
Keep ships moving</h1>
<hr>
<h3>by JO1 Catherine Kurchinski<br>
RIMPAC Combined Information Bureau</h3>

<strong>(Pearl Harbor, HI., June 10, 1996)</strong> --  Ship horns are blaring.  Tugboats are steaming.  And this harbor is buzzing with activity.<br>
It's 9:30 in the morning at the Naval Station Pearl Harbor Control Tower and signalmen are on watch at one of the busiest harbor control towers in the Pacific.  With the world's largest maritime exercise going on -- RIMPAC 96 -- Pearl Harbor's Port Control Division is extra busy ensuring safe passage for the hundreds of ships and submarines moving in and out of the harbor. <br>
Today, the tower's status control board reveals 21 ships and 13 submarines in port.  Near the end of the exercise, the number of visiting ships and submarines is expected  to increase dramatically. <br><a href="smphtwr.htm"><img src="smphtwr.gif" alt="Sailor manages Pearl Harbor tower" align="left" height=246 width=400></a>
"During peak periods we'll have 44 'out-of-towners' and five additional subs," said Lt. Cmdr. Ira Stokes, who oversees the naval station's operations.  "Volume-wise we handle more ships and submarines than any harbor on the West Coast except San Diego.  We're a transit port, and we catch everything that goes out to the Pacific and everything coming back." <br>
Perched atop the tower some 161-feet high, the signalmen have a commanding view of the entire harbor. <br>
"We can see everything from (the entrance to Pearl Harbor) to Merry Point Landing," said Signalman 2nd Class (SW) Raymond Behnke. <br>
And with the tower's "Big Eye" binoculars, they can zoom in on anything within an 18-mile radius. <br>
"I love the view up here," Behnke said.  "It's the best place to watch the Fourth of July fireworks!" <br>
Twenty-five World War II veterans witnessed fireworks of a different kind from this tower. <br>
"Those guys had a front row seat of the bombing of Pearl Harbor," said Signalman 1st Class Kevin Wilson.  A wooden plaque engraved with their names was mounted in the tower in their honor. <br>
Keeping the tower operating around-the-clock demands two 12-hour shifts.  Signalmen  work three days, then get three days off. <br>
"We're pretty much married to the tower for 12 hours," said SM2 Paul Sauvie, a harbor control dispatcher who directs ship traffic.  The tower receives daily "move sheets" from Port Operations that list vessels arriving or departing that day. <br>
The dispatcher on watch then communicates with harbor pilots and tugboat craftmasters via marine-band radio to keep vessels steadily moving in or out. <br><a href="rnbowtug.htm"><img src="rnbowtug.gif" alt="a rainbow arches down to a fleet tug in Pearl Harbor" align="left" height=520 width=350></a>
"All the ships obtain permission from the control tower before they move," Sauvie said. <br>
Although he was trying to find a berth for a submarine involved in RIMPAC, "it's actually a quiet day today," he said.  "The phones are usually cranking and the radio blaring. <br> 
(The other week) I had my busiest day.  Between moving assets and ships, I coordinated 63 moves." <br>
Harbor Control Sailors not only direct harbor traffic, they are responsible for playing a recording of the national anthem during morning and evening colors. <br>
During RIMPAC, the national anthems of Australia, Japan, Canada, Chile and Republic of Korea must be played along with the United States' during morning colors. <br>
"This is a number one priority," says Wilson.  "If we mess this up, everyone on the base knows about it." <br>
Because of the number of songs, morning colors last nearly eight minutes.  A few Sailors have jokingly lamented the fatigue of saluting for such a long period under the hot Hawaiian sun. <br>
With the intense responsibilities associated with harbor control and the added burden of a major exercise, the pace in the tower can be pretty hectic. <br>
"The stress factor can go up," Wilson said.  "But we have to keep a cool head and be professional at all times.  We can't let the ships detect any of our stress because we're port control, and we have to be in control." <br>

<title>RIMPAC 96 Missile Exercise a success</title>

<h1> RIMPAC 96 Missile Exercise a success </h1>
<hr>
<h2> by JO3 Dean Nazario<br>
Pacific Fleet Public Affairs Office</h2>

<strong>( ABOARD USS ANTIETAM (CG-54) , June 9, 1996)</strong> -- A cruise missile skims the ocean surface at twice the speed of sound toward the guided-missile cruiser USS Antietam (CG-54).<br>
Inside the ship's dark combat information center -- a nerve center of computer consoles, radar screens and large multi-colored displays -- Petty Officer 3rd Class Jason Janco, a radar console operator, reports "Missile inbound." <br><a href="misslkln.htm"><img src="misslkln.gif" alt="after a missile launch Sailors clean launch system before next launch" align="right" height=516 width=350></a>
The ship's sophisticated SPY-1A radar is used to detect and track the incoming missile, launched from a land base less than five miles away. <br>
With only seconds to react, Sailors target the missile, and the anti-air warfare coordinator recommends to the missile systems supervisor that the ship fire upon the incoming threat.
The supervisor acknowledges, and the coordinator issues a "kill order." <br>
"Kill track number -- with birds." <br>
The supervisor presses the fire authorize button on his console, and the "bird" -- a Standard Missile 2 Block III -- blasts from a vertical tube in Antietam's deck near the bow. <br>
With a bang and a whoosh, the Standard Missile is on a collision course with the cruise missile. <br>
It's over in seconds.<br>
Target engaged and destroyed.  The ship can sail another day. <br>
This time the scenario was fictional, but the stress was real.  Antietam -- one of a dozen ships participating in a missile exercise off Kauai -- launched a real Standard Missile against a 22-foot-long, ramjet-powered target called a Vandal. <br>
"For RIMPAC, we were allotted four missiles to shoot -- three Standard Missile 2 Block IIIs (SM-2 Bk III) and one Harpoon," Antietam's commanding officer, Capt. William Doud, announced to his crew.  "The men in the ship's Operations and Combat Systems Department successfully launched all four weapons. <br>
"That's a big plus, and it's an unusual event for any ship to get to shoot that many weapons in such a short period of time." <br>
<a href="missile.htm"><img src="missile.gif" alt="sea sparrow launches from USS CUSHING (DD-985)" align="left" height=289 width=400></a>
Ships and aircraft from the United States, Canada, Australia and the Republic of Korea participated in the exercise, part of the biennial RIMPAC 96 exercise. <br>
U.S. units included USS Cushing (DD-985), USS Antietam (CG-54), USS Cowpens (CG-63), USS Reid (FFG-30), Helicopter Anti-submarine Squadron Light 43 (HSL-43) and HSL-47, Patrol Squadron 46 (VP-46), two F-14 Tomcats and two F/A-18 Hornets, and an EA-6B Prowler from Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (VAQ-135). <br>
Other participants included the Canada's HMCS Regina (FFH-334), HMCS Huron (DDGH-281), HMCS Winnipeg (FFH-338) and HMCS Algonquin (DDGH-283); Australia's HMAS Perth (DD-38), HMAS Newcastle (FFG-06), HMAS Sydney (FFG-03) and Royal Australian Air Force F-111Cs; and Korea's ROKS Cheju (FF-958).<a href="pmrfmisl.htm"> <br><img src="pmrfmisl.gif" alt="A lone PMRF worker walks beside a Vandal rocket being transported for launch" align="right" height=513 width=300></a>
The simulated enemy cruise missiles were launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) at Barking Sands, Kauai, the world's largest instrumented, multi-environmental (subsurface, surface, air and space capabilities) range in the world. <br>
PMRF provided the "playground" for the forces to conduct their exercises using surface, aerial and subsurface targets, communications and data links, precision radar tracking and scenario control rooms. <br>
"During RIMPAC, we'll provide tracking information on exactly how close the target hits were," said Capt. Thomas Daniels, PMRF's commanding officer.  "Some of the weapons systems that are being tracked have telemetry, and when things don't go as planned, the telemetry data helps to explain why operations didn't work." <br>
Daniels stressed that safety is key during such exercises:  "You can't fire your missiles just anywhere.  You need a safe area.  That's why PMRF is one of the safest places to conduct these exercises.  We have the radar and telemetry coverage and the air assets to ensure that it's done in a very safe manner.  We can also ensure the firing zones are clear of any hazards so there are no incidents or mishaps." <br>
In the missile exercises, ships waited in an area called the "safety box," located a few miles south of PMRF between Kauai and Niihau.  They would then sail north to the engagement area to launch their missiles. <br>
A variety of scenarios took place. <br>
The destroyer Cushing, for example, fired a Sea Sparrow missile and destroyed a BQM-74E target drone that simulated an enemy cruise missile skimming above the ocean surface. <br>
In an anti-ship scenario, an SH-60 helicopter from HSL-43 launched its anti-ship Penguin missile and struck a floating target barge.  Cushing, Antietam, a RAAF F-111C and HMAS Newcastle launched Harpoon anti-ship missiles at the barge as well. <br>
In another surface-to-air scenario, seven ships cruised slowly through the missile range when two cruise-missile-like BQMs were launched at them from PMRF and two more were launched from a U.S. Air Force C-130. <br>
This was the first time Petty Officer 3rd Class Michael Lyon, a fire controlman aboard Antietam, launched a Standard Missile. <br>
"It was a rush watching the bird (SM-2) fly after I pushed the fire authorize button," said Lyon, who had practiced this scenario 15 times in simulation since RIMPAC started.  "I was the junior man in the work center and my supervisors felt I was capable of shooting a Standard Missile at a target, one of the most difficult scenarios in the (exercise)." <br>
In another exercise scenario, Antietam launched Harpoons at a floating target barge beyond the horizon with targeting support from U.S. Navy helicopters. <br>
"This was a 40-mile strike on the target, and it was a direct hit," said Lt. Cmdr. Dan Keller, Antietam's executive officer. <br>
Petty Officer 2nd Class Tim Sheriff, an operations specialist aboard Antietam, said,  "In a real wartime situation, we'd only have minutes, maybe even seconds, to launch a Harpoon at a hostile target." <br>
This was Sheriff's first time firing a Harpoon. <br>
In addition to the missile launches from the ships, air-to-air combat training also took place during the Missile Exercise. <br>
In four scenarios, F-14 Tomcats from the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) fired about 20 missiles and destroyed an equal amount of BQM-74E target drones. <br>
In another exercise, an S-3 Viking, F/A-18 Hornets, EA-6B Prowlers, a P-3C Orion and F-14s launched Harpoon anti-ship missiles and other missiles to successfully sink a floating hulk, Jung Sheng 8. <br>
In a theater ballistic missile defense exercise, ships were to test their radars tracking two AQM-37C target drones launched from a U.S. Navy A-6 Intruder. <br>
The Aegis cruisers Cowpens and Antietam successfully tracked the targets' ballistic courses to record heights. <br>
The drone climbed to a record-breaking 235,000 feet, said PMRF Fleet Branch Head Stewart Burley.  "We never saw one of these target drones fly higher than 90,000 feet." <br>
This was the first such test during a RIMPAC exercise.  It was also the first RIMPAC with anti-ship Penguin missile shots. <br>
"RIMPAC 96 provides an opportunity for foreign nations to come to PMRF and test their individual defensive weapons systems safely so they may be able to defend their nation in the event of a real threat," Range Scheduler Thomas Thomason said. <br>
"Each nation requested a specific scenario and target to test their weapon systems so they could maximize their training." <br>
PMRF's flexibility to meet those requests makes it a valuable contributor to military exercises in the Pacific. <br>
"If they (other nations) meet their objectives, they may plan to participate again in the next RIMPAC," Thomason said.  "They may also want to come back to PMRF to test newly developed or advanced systems.  In turn, this advertises the range for us."

<title>USS ESSEX Impresses Admiral During Visit</title>
<h1>USS ESSEX Impresses Admiral During Visit</h1>
<h2>By JO2 David J. Myers</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Aboard USS ESSEX, Pacific Ocean, May 25, 1996 </strong> -- Everybody likes to show off just a little bit, and USS ESSEX (LHD 2) is no exception.  Recently, ESSEX had the opportunity to strut her stuff, and showcase how the "Gator Navy" works.<br>
This opportunity came about when RADM Peter A. C. Long, commander, Cruiser and Destroyer Group FIVE (COMCRUDESGRU 5), came aboard from USS ANTIETAM (CG 54) on May 25 to get a good look at what amphibious ships and their embarked Marines are all about.<br>
CAPT William J. Marshall III, Commander, Amphibious Group FIVE, Commanding Officer CAPT Thomas F. Radich, and 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit Commander Officer COL. Robert B. Blose, all greeted the admiral when he came aboard.<br>
They then took him to a briefing where they explained many of the elements of the Amphibious Task Group (ATG), and how it works.  The admiral was particularly interested in communications and data flow between the different elements of the ATG.<br>
<a href="lhd2eng.htm"><img src="lhd2eng.gif" align="left" height=274 width=400></a>
Long then toured the ship from the Combat Information Center to the well deck and by all accounts was impressed with what he saw.  According to Marshall, "His comments reflected nothing but admiration for (ESSEX') commitment to excellence and a strong appreciation of the combined strength of the Navy/Marine team."<br>
While that may sound like a mouthful, the upshot is the admiral was so impressed with the "Iron Gator" that he wants to come back again and observe how the ATG works from the back of an LCAC.<br>
Before he left, Long was presented with an ESSEX ballcap and a photo book, which included pictures of the ESSEX in action and photos from his own trip.<br>

<title>ESSEX Marines Cash In On Payday</title>
<h1>ESSEX Marines Cash In On Payday</h1>
<h2>By J02 David J. Myers</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Aboard USS ESSEX, Pacific Ocean, May 25, 1996 </strong> -- Of all the things that Sailors and Marines look forward to, payday has to rank right at the top.  Now, through the efforts of the USS ESSEX and 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit's disbursing departments, payday for the Marines just got better.<br>
After a successful test program during RIMPAC '96, it looks like all shipboard Marines will be able to get paid through the ship's Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system during WESTPAC.  This is the first time ever that a continuous program has been set up to pay embarked Marines through the shipboard ATM system.<br>
<a href="marinpay.htm"><img src="marinpay.gif" align="right" height=274 width=400></a>
In a review conducted on May 20 by Navy Management Systems Support Officer (NAVMASSO) and Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP), the ESSEX trial program was found to have worked perfectly.
USS HARPERS FERRY (LSD 49) and USS CLEVELAND (LPD 7), members of the ESSEX Expeditionary Amphibious Task Group, plan to implement the system for WESTPAC.  In the future, all ships will implement a similar system to ESSEX and this next generation pay system will revolutionize how service members are paid.<br>
Marines are already happy about the results.  SSGT Nathan Portman of the 11th MEU said the program, was "living up to all my expectations."  He added, "It's like having your own personal vault and a key to access it whenever you desire."<br>
Marines had been paid through shipboard ATMs before, most recently in the Atlantic fleet, but only on a non-permanent basis.  The ESSEX new program not only streamlines the process, but makes it easy to use on an ongoing basis.<br>
Much of the credit for the program, according to Disbursing Officer LTJG David B. Gartrell, goes to DK1 (SW) Felix Carranza.  Gartrell said that when Commanding Officer CAPT Thomas F. Radich asked if Marines could be paid through the ESSEX ATMs like Sailors were, the ESSEX Supply Officer, CDR Chris R. McKelvey, said "We can make it happen, Captain."<br>
"The goal," according to McKelvey, "was to device a process that is transparent to the customer, as well as the entire disbursing function, including automated data processing with the Marine Finance Activity in Kansas City.<br>
"Then," said Gartrell "Carranza took the ball and ran with it."<br>
Carranza looked for a procedure for the program.  Finding no official procedure, he simply created his own.  He then took his idea to NAVSUP, and after a meeting that included representatives from 11th MEU and Defense Financial and Accounting Service, Cleveland, sold them on the idea.  On May 15, the first 46 trial Marines were paid.<br>
Carranza said that the system requires close cooperation between the ESSEX and the Marines.  "They do 50 percent, and we do 50 percent."  Explaining how the system works, Carranza said, "The ship is like a bank.  The MEU opens an account with us by writing us a check, and then the Marines are able to withdraw their money."<br>
Of course, detailed record-keeping and careful cross-checking makes the system more complicated than it sounds, but the trial program went off without a hitch, and Gartrell expects the system to work well on WESTPAC.<br>
In yet another example of joint cooperation, the ESSEX/11th MEU team has found a way to make life easier for all.<br>

<title>MILITARY SEALIFT COMMAND PUMPS LIFE INTO RIMPAC FORCES</title>
<h1>Military Sealift Command<br>
Pumps Life into RIMPAC Forces</h1>
<h2>By JO2 Jose V. Tolentino</h2>
<hr>
<strong>PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii, June 21, 1996</strong> -- Gasoline powers a car and the four MSCPAC (Military Sealift Command, Pacific) ships do the same for the exercise RIMPAC (Rim of the Pacific) 96.  They provide the fuel, ammunition, and other resources, the staging area in the Pacific Ocean for this massive international naval training exercise.<br>
The MSCPAC participants included the USNS Guadeloupe (T-AO 200), USNS Walter S. Diehl (T-AO 193), USNS Assertive (T-AGOS 9), USNS Victorious (T-AGOS 19), and USNS Effective (T-AGOS 21).<br>
Since 1971, MSCPAC's 24-ship force has effectively carried out its replenishment function by providing Navy Fleet Auxiliary Force support to naval forces, Special Mission support to the Department of Defense, and Strategic Sealift to deploy and sustain U.S. forces in carrying out national objectives in the Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Persian Gulf areas.<br>
MSCPAC's direct support of fleet units in the Pacific allows Navy warships to remain at sea for long periods.  This replenishment function is carried out by MSCPAC's Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force and includes vessels such as fleet oilers, supply ships, an ammunition ship, fleet ocean-going tugs and ocean surveillance vessels.<br>
The special mission needs of  the Defense Department are met by specialized ships involved in laying and retrieving communication cables, tracking missiles, and oceanographic research.<br>
Underscoring the impact of RIMPAC to MSC personnel,  ship's master Captain Mark A. Payne of the oiler USNS Effective (T-AGOS 21), "It is important because it helps to continue the good relationships we have with our allies."<br>
With more than 44 ships, 250 aircraft, and 30,000 military personnel taking part in RIMPAC, the biggest challenge for MSC remains the planning of its support for the exercise.<br>
"We have to figure out what supplies ships want from us, what we can provide them, and whether we have enough to give out," said Operations Specialist Chief Petty Officer Doug Ruggles, Assistant Officer-in-Charge for the USNS Walter S. Diehl, one of 18 new Kaiser class oilers capable of storing 180,000 barrels of oil and fueling two ships simultaneously while underway.<br>
Once that equation is solved, MSCPAC can bring to bear the combined talents of its 1,800 civil service mariners.  Although a small number of military personnel serve aboard many of the command's ships, they serve primarily as communications support personnel.  The majority of the crew, from the captain down to the steward, are federal civilians.<br>
"MSC is the largest employer of merchant seamen in the country," said Borden.  "It offers excellent training, decent pay, civil service benefits,  new ship assignments every six months, and excellent training."<br>

<title>PACIFIC MISSILE RANGE FACILITY SUPPORTS RIMPAC 96</title>
<h1>Pacific Missile Range Facility Barking Sands Supports RIMPAC 96 Missile Exercise</h1>
<h2>by JO3 Dean Nazario</h2>
<hr>
<strong>BARKING SANDS, Kauai, June 18, 1996</strong> -- Most of the major operations for Exercise Rim of the Pacific 96 would not be possible without the Pacific Missile Range Facility.<br>
Located on the western shores of Kauai, Hawaii, PMRF offers the military a "playing field" to conduct a number of training opportunities, including amphibious landings, missile launches and other coastal warfare operations.  The versatile facility also is used for testing and evaluating air, surface and subsurface weapons systems.<br>
PMRF commanding officer Capt. Thomas Daniels likens the facility to a football stadium:  "We provide a field in which ships, aircraft, ground troops and military members can train.  Like a football team, they need a field to play on that gives them feedback on what they're doing.<br>
"PMRF provides data and feedback so that we know from both training and (test and evaluation) missions exactly what happened and why it happened."<br>
The missile range provides feedback and other support to its users through radar, underwater instrumentation, telemetry and other sophisticated electronics.<br>
One of its facilities is the new Range Operations Control Center, which resembles NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston.<br>
Workers at three identical workstations use the Navy Tracking and Display System to monitor missile launches and coastal operations for exercises such as RIMPAC 96.  The tracking system uses state-of-the-art software and hardware to support real-time tracking and display, as well as data archiving and post-exercise analysis.<br>
"These computers maintain local underwater- and air-tracking data using conventional radar and video systems," Range Scheduler Thomas Thomason said.<br>
Operators are able to provide instant replay capability on video to let the ships know what occurred, how it occurred and to use the results to improve their training.<br>
"It lets them know of their performance almost immediately after their missile launch so they can learn from it and perhaps do better next time, or repeat the same success," Daniels said.<br>
"PMRF has an excellent geography to conduct missile exercises like the RIMPAC 96 (missile exercise).  It has high ridgelines that drop vertically off into the ocean."<br>
For example, Kokee Park, an elevation of 3,800 feet above PMRF, was used as a surrogate airborne platform during the Mountain Top Exercises early this year, which demonstrated an advanced concept technology in cruise missile defense using the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC).<br>
Its geography is rare, making the island a national asset.  Its lack of encroachment makes PMRF virtually free of commercial air traffic and ocean traffic.<br>
"We can ensure nearly 100 percent of the time, the range and the surrounding waters will not be inhibited by such traffic," Thomason said.<br>
Its 42,000 square miles of range provide wide open spaces to conduct a multitude of operations.  "PMRF is the only facility you can conduct subsurface, surface, air and space operations simultaneously," Daniels said.<br>
It has 1,000 square miles of undersea range.  By extending the undersea range close to the shore line, "it enables us to have a deep water to shallow water" undersea, anti-submarine warfare, capability, Daniels said.  "Right now, we only have a deep water practice facility for ships.<br>
"Some of today's systems will not work the same in shallow water as they do in deep water because of oceanographic phenomena," he said.  "When you transition from deep water to shallow water, you change the way you need to fight the battle."<br>
PMRF's $27 million shallow water testing range is scheduled for completion in 1997.<br>
"We don't conduct many spaceflight missions," Daniels said, "but we have the capability to track satellites and the space shuttle as backup to the main spaceflight tracking stations."<br>
Kauai's natural coastal environment and open ocean area supports theater missile defense (TMD) and theater ballistic missile defense (TBMD) operations.  "In TBMD, PMRF launches targets that fly into space and track their course of action back down to Earth," Daniels said.<br>
Moreover, PMRF is close to the rest of the Hawaiian military complex (on Oahu).<br>
It can support joint U.S. military operations like the recent CEC/Mountain Top exercises, as well as combined, or multinational, military operations like RIMPAC 96.<br>
In addition to PMRF's military programs supporting fleet exercises, it also has an aggressive environmental program of recycling paper, aluminum and green waste.  It also maintains a seabird nesting sanctuary for wedgetail shearwater, it uses approved lighting to avoid disorienting Newell shearwater, and provides a nesting habitat for the laysan albatross.<br>
There are 113 naval officers and enlisted members out of the total 918 people stationed at the facility, and Daniels is proud of every one of them.<br>
"We've got a phenomenal group of Sailors at PMRF," Daniels said.  "They're involved in many community service activities including the annual Waimea Town Celebration, the Adopt-a-School Program, the Toys For Tots Program and highway and beach cleanup.<br>
"Sailors also work on our aircraft and boats, keeping those assets operational for 100 percent availability," he said.  "In the past two years, we never lost a single mission due to lack of aircraft or target availability."<br>
For the facility's "good neighbor" contributions to the island, it has earned several awards.  April 1995 was proclaimed PMRF Month by the mayor for superior community service.  PMRF was named by the State of Hawaii Department of Education, Kauai District, as the Outstanding Business Education Partner of 1994.<br>
PMRF's origins date back 40 years ago when the Navy came to Kauai needing a place to test its Regulus I surface-to-surface guided missile.  Regulus I was introduced into the fleet in 1955, and remained operational until it was replaced by Polaris in 1961.<br>
Since 1958, PMRF has performed more than 6,000 major training and T&E operations.  Customers have included the U.S. military and foreign navies, NASA and many university and contractor research and development programs.  It is the lead range in the Pacific for Aegis cruiser Combat System Ship Qualification Training prior to its initial deployment.<br>
PMRF is one facility that was able to survive the military's drawdown.  "In the past couple years, there were fears that the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) would close the facility," Daniels said.  "What resulted was the reverse.  The spotlight was put on PMRF highlighting all its unique features such as wide open spaces, lack of encroachment and natural geography.<br>
"In 1995, PMRF had more business than it has had since 1983, when a lot of money was being poured into the military," Daniels said.<br>
PMRF's economic impact on Hawaii totaled more than $100 million in Fiscal Year 1995.  More than 7 percent of that money was poured into the tourist industry.<br>
"Although we've been going through a downsizing over the past five years, 1995 was the biggest year we've had," Daniels said.  "That says people are recognizing the capabilities of PMRF and are coming here more often.<br>
"If we can support the fleet in providing them with the best possible training they could receive in a safe manner, that will be the real benefit -- a bonus to fleet readiness."<br>

<title>RIMPAC CHALLENGES EOD PROFESSIONALS</title>
<h1>RIMPAC Challenges EOD Professionals</h1>
<h2>By JO1 Andy Wellman</h2>
<hr>
<strong>MARINE CORPS BASE HAWAII, Kaneohe, June 17, 1996</strong> -- We've got them, they've got them. Mines, bombs, missiles and other high explosive devices are in the military hardware inventories of every nation. No matter who has them they can be just as dangerous to their owners as to their targets.<br>
The joint service multi-national exercise, RIMPAC 96, being held in Hawaii is providing explosive ordinance disposal units with training that emphasizes the safe handling of wanted and unwanted explosives.<br>
One scenario played out during this biennial "war game" began as Marine Staff Sgt. Ken Couch of the Kaneohe Marine Base Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) detachment reported a bomb to the exercise's EOD command post.<br>
At the other end of the line, members of the Australian Clearance Diving Team Four, encamped at a weapons storage depot across the island, were being dispatched.<br>
The information given in the report claimed several aircraft on the Kaneohe flightline had been destroyed and the one that remained had a canvas covered box on the floor of the cockpit.<br>
Inside the box was a booby-trap fashioned from a wind-up clock wired to a smoke bomb located in the back of the plane. It was set to go off three hours from the time the call was placed.  The parcel was placed by members of the Marines and Navy Training and Evaluation Units.<br>
In all, it took nearly an hour and a half for the team to pack their gear and drive 30 miles to the Marine base to begin work on the simulated bomb.<br>
At the scene the first task for Team Four was to question the caller who reported the explosions to determine everything he had done and seen since the bombings began.  Next they establish a  safety zone around the plane and the area where they would assemble their bomb disposal tools.<br>
One of the primary tools used to disarm bombs is a small cannon, called the RAKE (remote access kinetic entry device) by the Aussies.  The device is an 18 inch long tube which was filled with water. Once filled the tool is capped and an explosive charge is inserted into the other end.  The charge is set off electronically through long wires from a detonator set up a safe distance away, blasting the water into the bomb.<br>
The premise behind the tool's operation is that if you blow the bomb apart, faster than its internal circuitry can detonate its explosives, it can be handled safely.<br>
With the RAKE assembled and filled with water it was time to approach the aircraft.  For the purposes of RIMPAC the airframe of a old scrapped-out F-4 fighter was used.<br>
The clock continued to tick down.<br>
Australian Chief Petty Officer Terry Smith took the job of analyzing the parcel and placing the RAKE.<br>
After placing the RAKE in the jet, Chief Smith followed the wire running back to the detonator outside the danger zone. The warning "Stand Clear" was given and then a countdown began.  Five, four, three, two, one, BOOM!<br>
Cautiously Smith left from the safe zone and again climbed onto the wing.  After a few minutes he emerged from the cockpit and shook his head in disappointment.  The RAKE had not sufficiently spread the bomb's components and another attempt would have to be made.<br>
Chief Smith again returned to the safety zone to reload the water cannon and plan the next shot with the rest of his team.<br>
More than two hours and 45 minutes had now passed without the bomb being disarmed.<br>
Concern now spread among the evaluators over whether or not the Australians next attempt might involve some real danger should the booby-trap go off while the next RAKE was being placed.  The charge was small but could, as one evaluator put it, "ring his bell."  No one wanted to risk causing an injury for the sake of training.<br>
The observers debated and decided to let them continue but only a few ticks were left on the clock.<br>
As the Australian Chief was returning a rifle-like crack reported from within the cockpit. A stunned look flushed over the Chief's face as it was immediately apparent that time had run out.<br>
Observer Chief Warrant Officer Earl Dennis, of the U.S. Navy's San Diego Mobile Unit 7 spoke out. "Go ahead and lie down Chief. You're not dead but, if this were real, you would need to be medevaced."<br>
Hearing the blast Lt. Scott Craig, the Australian officer in charge hurried to the scene to carry the "wounded" chief back to the safe zone.<br>
All that was left for Team 4 to do was to phone the EOD command post to report the device had "high ordered" (detonated) and arrange for medical support.<br>
"We don't always win," said Couch.  "EOD is dangerous work, but exercises like this really help prepare you for actual situations."<br>
The evaluator raised questions on the tactics Team Four used, their sense of urgency and other decisions that might have changed the outcome. "We're not here to judge them," Couch says, "We tell them what we noticed and how we would have handled the different parts of the exercise."<br>
"There are many ways to handle bombs," says AOC Marc Bond of EOD Mobile Unit 7, "No matter what you do or how long it takes, if you beat the device you've won.  It just didn't happen today."<br>
The basic mission of EOD is to prevent a detonation and to protect life and limb to the utmost. That in mind the Australians and Americans headed into the Kaneohe Marine Base Hawaii's EOD office for more discussions behind closed doors.<br>

<title>Reserve Squadron Supports Special Operations During RIMPAC 96</title>

<h1>Reserve Squadron Supports<br>
Special Operations<br>
During RIMPAC 96</h1>
<h2>By JO1 Catherine Kurchinski</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Pearl Harbor, HI, June 14, 1996 </strong> -- 
In the cover of darkness, a U.S. Navy HH-60H  'Sea Hawk' helicopter lands in an abandoned sugar cane field on the island of Oahu. To the naked eye, the helo is nearly invisible. Outside of the aircraft, inside the cockpit and cabin, no lights can be seen. Night vision goggles are worn by the pilots and crew.<br>
Jumping out of the helo in quick succession are six Navy SEALS, armed with M-16 semi-automatic rifles. Jungle green paint covers their faces, revealing only the whites of their eyes. Hunched down, they scan their surroundings. Slowly and quietly, they move undetected through the field toward their target.<br>
These Navy SEALS are part of the Combined  Special Operations Task Force in Exercise Rim of the Pacific, or RIMPAC 96, being held in and around the Hawaiian Islands.  And helping SEALS to do their job are Reservists from Helicopter Combat Support Special Squadron 5 (HCS-5), Pt. Mugu, Calif.<br>
"Helicopter support for SEALS during special warfare operations is one of our primary missions," said Lt. Cmdr. Matt Ragan, a Naval Reservist and one of 34 pilots assigned to the squadron. "We take them wherever they need to go to perform their mission."<br>
HCS-5, along with its sister squadron, HCS-4, Norfolk, Va., perform combat search and rescue operations, as well as special warfare operations,  including inserting (delivering) and extracting (picking up) SEALS via a Special Patrol Insertion and Extraction Rig (a cable attached to the aircraft SEALS use to climb down during airborne operations), fast rope, parachute drops, and vertical shipboard search and seizure (SEALS landing aboard enemy ships.)<br>
This highly-trained, tightly-knit squadron of Reservists and TAR's (Training and Administration of Reserves) can deploy anywhere in the world within 72 hours, said Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Bright, squadron maintenance officer.<br>
During exercises such as RIMPAC 96, squadron members hone their skills and work  directly with their active-duty counterparts.<br>
"We had the chance to work with the Australian Special Forces for the first time," said Cmdr. Douglas Moret, squadron commanding officer. "It was both challenging and rewarding working through and resolving  the operational differences our two units encountered during this joint exercise. It was a priviledge and a pleasure to work with such a professional group."<br>
More than 40 ships from the U.S., Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan and the Republic of Korea are involved in this year's exercise. Conducted every two years, RIMPAC improves coordination and interoperability of joint forces in maritime tactical and theater operations.<br>
Lt. Jeffrey Bowman, a Navy SEAL and operations officer at Seal Delivery Vehicle Team 1, Ford Island, said his unit has conducted seven operations so far with HCS-5. "They are serving a direct support role for insertion (landing) and extraction (picking up) of Special Operations Forces," Bowman said.<br>
Moret, an 18-year veteran who joined the squadron last year, said he's been "very, very pleased with his squadron's performance during RIMPAC 96.<br>
"The coordination has been good. The execution by everyone has been absolutely stellar. This is our second RIMPAC, so we have corporate knowledge from the first one, which is always helpful. The missions we've done thus far have been almost perfect."<br>

<title>VP-65 aircrews support RIMPAC operations</title>

<h1>VP-65 aircrews support RIMPAC operations</h1>
<h2>by JO2 Denise Garcia<br>Naval Air Reserve Point Mugu, CA, Public Affairs Office</h2>
<hr>
<strong>(June 12, 1996)</strong> -- Naval Reservists from Patrol Squadron Six Five (VP-65) stationed at Naval Air Weapons Station Point Mugu, Calif., are in Hawaii completing their Annual Training in support of Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) operations 1996.  RIMPAC is one of the largest maritime exercise conducted by the U.S. designed to enhance interoperability with our allies.<br>
 VP-65 flies the turbo-prop P-3C Orion and is the only Reserve Force Squadron participating in RIMPAC that specializes in undersea warfare.  “The P-3 is the most flexible aircraft in the Navy’s arsenal,” said Cmdr. Richard Hayes, VP-65's Commanding Officer.  “It  performs undersea warfare, surface warfare, surveillance, reconnaissance, over-the-horizon targeting, radio communication relay, and just about anything the Task Force Commander can think of.”<br>
VP-65 and Japanese P-3 aircrews are training to ensure that they can work together in the event of a global crisis.  “Each mission is designed so that we always turn over to a Japanese P-3,” said Hayes.  “We take turns tracking submarines and ships.  During a shift change, we pass the target’s course, speed and position to the relieving P-3 so it can continue the surveillance.”<br>
How does the aircrew gather information to pass onto the Japanese P-3?  There are 12 crew members: three pilots, two navigators, two flight engineers, three sensor operators, one in-flight technician, and one in-flight ordnanceman.  Each play a significant role to successfully complete its assigned mission.<br>
The pilot is the aircraft commander.  He flies the aircraft and is responsible for its position and tactical operations.  “The pilot ensures the plane is positioned right so that the sonobuoys drop right, or the photographs are taken correctly, and so it can ultimately drop a weapon on a target,” Hayes said.<br>
At stations behind the cockpit, sit two navigators.  One is called the Tactical Coordinator (TACCO).  The TACCO develops a plan-of-action that will be most effective in carrying out the aircraft’s mission.  He analyzes the collected information from the aircrafts supporting stations and continuously monitors, reviews, and revises the plan-of-action as the situation dictates.  Although the pilot has final weapons release authority, the TACCO assists the pilot in determining what weapon to use, and where and when to release it.<br>
The Geographic Navigator, who sits next to the TACCO, uses charts and a computer to track the aircraft’s global position and its position in relation to the target.  “I’m not only the navigator,” said Lt. Cmdr. Roy Wesley, of El Dorado Hills, Calif.  “I also keep track of everything that goes into the computer, and print the information for post-flight analysis.”  The navigator is also responsible for all communication between other aircraft, ships, and the command center.  “I help the TACCO in keeping track of the tactical picture, too,” said Wesley.  “He does it electronically and I do it manually, so that we have a back-up in case the computer dies.”   <br>
Next, are the sensor operators.  The P-3s drop sonobuoys into the ocean which have microphones that record undersea noises.  Different submarines have different characteristics, and the two Acoustic Operators can identify a sub by the sound it makes in the water.  According to Hayes, the Acoustic Operators can also tell which country the submarine belongs to.<br>
The third sensor station is the Non-Acoustic Operator.  He operates the radar systems and the Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD).  “A submarine is a big iron object underwater which creates a disturbance in the earth’s magnetic field,” said Petty Officer 1st Class Ralph Santiago, an aviation warfare systems operator.  “When we fly over a sub, I detect the disturbance on the MAD system, and right then, we know where the sub is and we can immediately drop a weapon after positively identifying it as the enemy,” continued Santiago, who is from Poway, Calif.<br>
The aircrew can’t complete its mission without the In-Flight Technician (IFT) and the Flight Engineer (FE).  The IFT ensures the computer systems are working correctly.  “I’m usually the first person to the plane before a flight,” said Petty Officer 2nd Class Mark Krajeck, an aviation electronics technician.  “I turn on all the avionics and do some preliminary checks to make sure everything is functional, and I get the computer ready so when the crew boards they can immediately do their further, detailed station checks.”  Krajeck, who is from Camarillo, Calif., also said that during a flight, if all systems are working correctly, he assists in visually locating other aircraft and submarines.<br>
The FE is the pilots right-hand man.  He has a thorough knowledge of all systems and equipment in his control, and their operation during normal and emergency conditions.  “Before take off, I perform all exterior and interior systems checks, record who and how many people are on board, calculate the aircraft’s cargo and ensure the cargo’s weight is distributed evenly,” said Petty Officer 3rd Class Richard Trecero, an aviation electronics technician.  During the flight, Trecero monitors the engines and system flight station controls and indicators.  “If there are any malfunctions, the pilots looks to the FE to see what needs to be done to either continue the mission safely, or to return to base,” continued Trecero, who is from Pueblo, Colo.<br>
“Our Reservists’ performance is outstanding,” said Hayes.  “We’ve met all our mission and training requirements for Annual Training.  In doing so, we’ve worked closely with our ‘regular Navy’ counterparts and all the other RIMPAC participants to perform this exercise safely and professionally.”<br>

<center><h2> VP-65 Meets<br>
Maintenance<br>
Challenges</h2>
<h4>By JO2 Denise Garcia</h4></center>
<hr>
<strong>(Barbers Point, HI., June 13, 1996)</strong> -- 
The Naval Reservists of Patrol Squadron Six Five (VP-65) from Naval Air Weapons Station Point Mugu, Calif., recently arrived at Naval Air Station Barbers Point, Hawaii, to participate in Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 1996 training operations.  RIMPAC is an integrated exercise which includes elements of all U.S. Armed Forces, and forces from Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan and South Korea.<br>
VP-65 flies the turbo-prop P-3C Orion and is the only Reserve Force Squadron participating in RIMPAC that specializes in undersea warfare.<br>
Before leaving Point Mugu in mid-May for RIMPAC operations, the Maintenance Department "phased" four P-3s, which is an in-depth inspection of the aircraft.  All fluids and filters were changed, flight controls and engine components were lubed, and the planes were inspected for cracks, corrosion and leaks.  "We bust them down to parade rest and look them all over," said Chief Petty Officer Jo Klippel, the Quality Assurance Chief.  The process takes approximately three days to complete.<br>
Since arriving in Hawaii the squadron has logged nearly 200 flight hours.  This  schedule keeps the Maintenance Department running.  Teamwork and dedication play a critical role in the success of all maintenance evolutions.  VP-4, which is hosting VP-65, assists in briefing crews with current station policy and procedures.  "We brought most of our own parts," said Klippel, "but we've had to look to VP-4 for assistance, and we've used the base's parts pool.  Their support has allowed us to fly all our assigned missions."<br>
The maintenance personnel, or "maintainers," make up a 1/3 of approximately 80 Reservists currently performing their two-week Annual Training (AT).  "One of the biggest challenges the Maintenance Department faces is the transition from mission readiness training to real-time Fleet operations," said Lt. j.g. Todd White, the Maintenance Material Control Officer.<br>
"We've had repair tasks requiring two days to complete, encompassing multiple work shifts," White said.  "We have streamlined our shift schedules to provide around the clock support of flight operations and enhance squadron morale," continued White, who is from San Jose, Calif.<br>
"During the flight to Hawaii, one of the planes had to shut down an engine because metal was detected in the oil," said Petty Officer 1st Class Jim Ward, an aviation electrician's mate from Chatsworth, Calif.  "As soon as the plane landed we began to fix it."<br>
The P-3s carry a variety of sophisticated anti-submarine warfare equipment to detect, identify, and if necessary, destroy enemy submarines.  These systems always need to be cool.  With the temperatures and humidity factors in the 90s, the P-3s' air conditioning systems are working a lot harder and need frequent repairs.  "We've had to change three engine drive compressors," said Klippel.  Engine drive compressors in the air conditioning unit supplies air for pressurizing and cooling of the aircraft.<br>
"The biggest challenge for the administrative side of the Maintenance Department is keeping track of the aircraft status board," said Petty Officer 2nd Class Sherrie Cummings of Knoxville, Tenn.  Cummings, an aviation administrationman, uses the Naval Aviation Logistics Command Management Information System (NALCOMIS) to track the aircrews flight hours, aircraft readiness, part numbers and maintenance requirements.  "Everyone here is on the go," Cummings said, "and it's a challenge to log the correct numbers to properly reflect aircraft status.  These numbers are important so we can perform the proper maintenance on the aircraft," she continued.<br>
"We are thrilled to be at Naval Air Station Barbers Point to provide contributory support for RIMPAC '96," said Cmdr. Richard Hayes, VP-65's Commanding Officer.  "Many of our personnel are completing their two-week Annual Training, and I can't think of a better environment to obtain that training.  Our people and aircraft are ready for the best RIMPAC ever."<br>

<title>RIMPAC 96: NEO training aids in real world missions</title>

<h1>Marines evacuate Americans:</h1>
<h2>NEO training aids in real world missions</h2>
<h3>by Cpl. Marc Ayalin, USMC</h3>
<hr>
<strong>(Kaneohe Bay, HI., June 11, 1996)</strong> -- The painful cries of injured and frightened American citizens echoed through the U.S Embassy compound in the fictional country of Pacifica June 10 and 11, as Marines and Sailors evacuated refugees from this war-torn island nation.<br>
The simulated Noncombatant Evacuation Operation was part of the RIMPAC '96 six- week training exercise for the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, who is preparing for an upcoming Western Pacific deployment in September.<br>
RIMPAC '96 is the largest Naval exercise in the Pacific. More than 30,000 Marines Sailors, Soldiers, Airmen and Coast Guardsmen representing the United States, Japan, Chile, the Republic of Korea, Australia and Canada were involved in the biennial event conducted in and around the Hawaiian Islands. <br>
"Currently, the Marine Corps is conducting a real world NEO in Monrovia, Liberia," said Capt. Scott Lopez, 11th MEU Public Affairs Officer. "Should this contingency arise for the Marines and Sailors of the 11th MEU during their deployment, they've had realistic training to successfully accomplish the mission."<br>
The 36-hour event involved more than 400 Marines and Sailors from the 11th MEU, including elements of India Company, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines and Combat Service Support Group-3.<br>
 Prior to the NEO, ethnic tensions between the governments of Pacifica and Capmid, a neighboring country desiring to unify both nations, began to escalate. A Capmidian-sponsored insurgency jeopardized the safety of U.S. citizens and third country nationals. As a result, the U.S. Embassy, its staff and the Military Survey Liaison Team from the 11th MEU were ordered to coordinate the evacuation with their Amphibious Task Group (USS ESSEX, USS HARPERS FERRY and USS CLEVELAND)counterparts positioned off shore. <br>
"Once this becomes a military operation, the ambassador would usually defer to military leaders and work together with them to accomplish the mission," said LtCol. Richard E. Jannell, executive officer, 11th MEU.<br>
Aboard the USS ESSEX, Marines and Sailors of Battalion Landing Team, 3rd Bn., 1st Marines, were tasked to execute the operation. Immediately, command elements of BLT 3/1 began planning their course of action. On land, insurgent Pacificans sympathetic to Capmid, showed their aggression by assassinating the mayor of a local town. This act posed a threat to the safety of U.S. citizens, therefore a small force from the ATG augmented the MSLT to provide added security at the embassy.  <br>
The Pacificans, some of whom were employees of the embassy, were unable to seek asylum in the U.S. This prompted them to vent their anger by conducting drive-by shootings on the embassy the night before the evacuation. <br> 
"The most important aspect is the security of the U.S. citizens and embassy personnel," said CWO2 Ed Coffer, Ground Defense Security Officer, 11th MEU. "The most difficult thing however, is unknown threats such as not knowing who the enemy is and what's his capability."<br>
The morning of the evacuation began unfriendly as more than a hundred riled protesters stood outside the embassy carrying slogans saying, "U.S. GO HOME!" The protest grew intense as Marine security forces told the crowd to return to disperse. Water balloons, soda cans and burned newspaper were launched from the crowd hitting Marines as they tried to avoid the falling objects.<br>
In order to pacify and disrupt the angry crowd's concentration, Marine reservists from the 3rd Civil Affairs Group, psychological operations detachment, Camp Pendleton, Calif., played a repetitive high-pitched wailing sound over a loudspeaker on the embassy roof. At first, efforts were effective as protesters began dispersing. However, they immediately regrouped after the sounds ceased.<br>
"If you really relay the right message and make your target audience passive, you can avoid armed conflict," SSgt. Jose C. Piedra, 3rd Civil Affairs Group, Camp Pendleton.<br>
Suddenly, the protest became a riot as the crowd broke through the wire barriers rushing the embassy's compound. The rioters nearly entered the embassy before being driven back by Marine sniper fire from the embassy rooftop. One rioter simulated getting hit in the leg and was carried away by two other rioters.<br>
Seconds after shots had been fired, the crowd began to flee the area. Within minutes the embassy grounds were silent. Broken glass and debris lay throughout the area as Marines assessed damage.<br>
Twenty minutes after the area was secure, the first wave of evacuees began to approach the already battered embassy. Families desperate to exit the country flocked to the front gate of the embassy. Some evacuees were injured from local insurgents out to assault U.S. citizens. <br>
To counter the threat of a Sapper attack, each individual was thoroughly searched for weapons or contraband before entering the embassy compound.  Inside the embassy, a medical triage site was set up to treat the injured. Emergency medical cases were first priority and were processed for immediate evacuation.<br>
In a timely manner, the refugees both able and injured, were bused to one of two evacuation control centers where processing continued. At the ECCs, individuals were categorized into different groups such as males and females under or over the age of 18, pregnant women or eligible family members of U.S. citizens. Afterwards, they were carried on several five-ton trucks to one of two extraction sites where Air-Cushioned Landing Crafts, Landing Craft Utility boats and CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters took them to one of the ATG ships. <br>
As the helicopters and landing crafts began leaving the sites, the Marines and Sailors of the 11th MEU began closing down. Soon the evacuees would be reunited with family and friends back in America.<br>

<title>P-3 SQUADRONS DO THEIR PART</title>
<h1>P-3 Squadrons Do Their Part to Make Sure the Pacific Rim is Secure</h1>
<h2>by JO2 Andrew Cramer</h2>
<hr>
<strong>BARBER'S POINT, Hawaii, June 10, 1996</strong> -- For threats on or beneath the sea, nothing beats a P-3C Orion aircraft, according to an Australian navy lieutenant who flies the four-engine turboprop.<br>
"The biggest thing for us as P-3 pilots to take away from RIMPAC is how the other countries crews operate their aircraft," said Australian navy pilot Lt. Gavin Sordelli.<br>
"We're all familiar with the capabilities of the other countries' aircraft, but the more we fly together, the more we see how each other handles day-to-day crisis, and the better pilots we become."<br>
The Australian squadron Sordelli is with, as well as P-3 squadrons from the United States and Canada, were in Hawaii as part of the multi-national force as part of RIMPAC 96.  The Japanese also brought one of their P-3 squadrons, and together with the U.S., make up the opposing bi-lateral force.<br>
The two other countries participating in the biennial exercise -- the Republic of Korea and Chile -- sent some P-3 air crews to observe operations and deployment strategies.<br>
"RIMPAC is very helpful, in that we get to put our P-3C through paces with our allies and all our ships on a single mission," said U.S. Navy Lt. Brad Dunham, a P-3C pilot with Patrol Squadron Nine (VP-9).<br>
"Basically, it allows us to become more competent with things we don't see and deal with that often, like another country's anti-submarine warfare tactics," said Dunham, whose squadron is stationed at Barbers Point Naval Air Station on Oahu.<br>
Having six countries involved in a month-long exercise would seemingly confuse things, but Lt. Scott Howell, another VP-9 pilot, said it doesn't.<br>
"The thing that unites all Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) like the P-3 is that we all do things essentially the same all over the world," he said.<br>
"MPA level of professionalism is so high that we know without a doubt that we can do our mission together."<br>
Originally derived from the Electra passenger airliner, the P-3 has been in production for more than 30 years.<br>
It is a workhorse for nine nations, performing anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare missions, as well as search and rescue, maritime patrol and mining.<br>
Canada flies a modified version of the P-3C, the CP-140 Aurora, said Maj. Fred Bigelow, executive officer of Canada's 407th squadron.<br>
"A big difference between our aircraft and that of other P-3s is our CP-140 can't fire on an opposing ship or sub," Bigelow said.  "So for our part, we do surface surveillance and target anything we find for the American or Australian P-3s."<br>
The standard P-3C is equipped with AGM-86 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, torpedoes and depth bombs.  It also can carry two AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missiles for `self-defense.'<br>
According to Bigelow, P-3 pilots, tactical officers, communicators and ground crew would agree that working in a busy theater with five other nations is a realistic scenario.<br>
"In the future, something like the (Persian) Gulf War or Bosnia-Herzegovina will always be another coalition environment," said Bigelow, "and therefore it is very necessary to work with as many of our allies on a regular basis as we can."<br>
The South American nation of Chile bought eight P-3A Orions from the United States in 1993.<br>
For its first RIMPAC, Chile's navy sent four pilots to observe P-3C flights, said Lt. Mario Folch, a pilot with Chile's navy.<br>
"Chile, and especially the Chilean navy, is making a great effort to operate on a wider scope in the Pacific," said Folch.  "Adding P-3s is just one way to do this."<br>
Flying with American and Australian aircrews has given Chile's pilots much-needed experience, he said.<br>
"Right now, we only use our P-3As for surface surveillance," he said.  "RIMPAC allows us to talk with our counterparts and trade information so we can expand our P-3A use to things like anti-submarine warfare in the future."<br>
Lt. Jorge Germain, a Chilean navy tactical officer, said flying with American and Australian P-3 crews has been useful.<br>
"Just working alongside the American and Australian crews and seeing how all of us do the same job has been very helpful to us," Germain said.  "The P-3 helps us increase our standing with other countries by giving us a larger role in the defense of the Pacific Rim."<br>
Royal Australian Navy flying officer Robert Tucker said learning about other countries' P-3s is important, especially when the aircrews have to work with one another in a crisis.<br>
"When a crisis develops somewhere in the Pacific, you aren't out there by yourself -- you have to use all the other forces from other countries," Tucker said.  "When we're all in the air like this at once, it can get pretty nasty if you don't know what you're doing."<br>

<title> Two Princeton Sailors recall mine damage </title>

<h1>Two Princeton Sailors<br>recall mine damage</h1>
<hr>
<h2>By JO1(SW) S.A. Thornbloom<br>
Pacific Fleet Public Affairs Office </h2>

<strong>( PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii, June 7, 1996)</strong> -- On Feb. 18, 1991, at 7:16 a.m., the crew of the guided-missile cruiser USS Princeton (CG-59) was rocked from their morning routine after two Iraqi mines exploded beneath the ship in the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Storm.<br>
For Operational Specialist 1st Class Bryan Pacheco, the shock of seeing light flashing through a gash in the ship's overhead is as bright today as the sun shining above him here in Hawaii. <br>
"I was in berthing and the vivid thing I remember was seeing daylight when I looked up because there was a crack on the quarterdeck," said the Las Vegas native, who today is the leading petty officer in Princeton's Combat Information Center (CIC). <br>
Lt.j.g. Gerald Papenfuss, who was an operational specialist chief and the watch supervisor in the ship's CIC that morning, remembered "a lot of confusion." <br>
"The lights went out and the ship went dark," he said.  "We had everything happen from flooding to the weapons system going down and a loss of steering." <br>
The two Princeton crewmembers, who left the ship for other commands shortly after returning home from the Persian Gulf War, are back on board the Ticonderoga-class Aegis cruiser participating in RIMPAC 96. <br>
The Princeton, fully recovered and repaired from the devastating mine damage, is the flagship for the Multi-National Force in the biennial exercise that involves six rim-of-the-Pacific nations. <br>
Standing near the aft Harpoon missile tubes, Pacheco and Papenfuss looked back on that unforgettable morning when the two "bottom-influence" mines exploded beneath their ship.  Such mines are designed to detonate beneath a ship, buckling the hull. <br>
As they looked at the deck that Pacheco says looked like "a giant pair of pliers had been taken to it," they agreed it was probably the crew's training that saved Princeton. <br>
"You can't say enough about how much training you can do on firefighting and dewatering," said Papenfuss, from Toledo, Ohio.  "People that go to training that haven't experienced anything like that think that half the time they're just walking through the motions.  When it comes down to doing it they're really pretty thankful they know exactly what to do.  It ends up saving a lot of lives." <br>
The pair also recalled how the crew's training clicked in automatically as the they fought to repair the damage to keep the ship afloat. <br>
"On the way over (to the gulf) we had trained and trained so everyone's response was pretty reflexive," said Papenfuss.  "They just ran and did what they normally did during training." <br>
The crew's discipline and the fact they look out for each other also helped prevent a lot of casualties, Pacheco added. <br>
"We only had a few cuts and bruises," he said.  "The only major casualty was to our bow mine watch, who was flipped over and cut an artery in his neck and shattered one of his knees." <br>
After the crew did what they could to get the damage under control, the ship was towed to Bahrain for further assessment and to be shorn up by USS Jason (AR-8).  The repair ship welded I-beams onto the main deck and along the sides. <br>
"Everybody went to work to try to get the ship in the best condition we could," said Papenfuss. <br>
The cruiser was then towed to a dry-dock facility in the United Arab Emirates for two months of further repairs.  While in dry-dock, the damaged portion of the hull was cut away and replaced so the ship could leave the gulf ahead of the battle group, slowly steaming under its own power for its San Diego homeport, Papenfuss said. <br>
"We went ahead because we had to go at a slower speed," he said.  "But the battle group did catch up with us so we could all arrive back home together." <br>
After returning home Princeton faced several more months of extensive shipyard repair.  Cracks to the superstructure had to be fixed.  Decks had to be replaced.  The tubes to the aft Harpoon missiles were realigned and the propeller shafts were straightened. <br>
It was a job that showed how important shipyard facilities are to the Navy, according to Lt. Cmdr. Matthew Sharpe, Princeton's current executive officer. <br>
"Princeton is here (today) because damage control happened effectively and because we have the industrial facilities, the skills and the dedication to be able to build and repair ships.  We should recognize the importance of that capability in the role it played in Princeton coming back on line and the role it plays in the future." <br>
Both Gulf War veterans and Princeton's present crew share a sense of pride of where the ship has come from the terrible damage it suffered five years ago.  According to Sharpe, the ship is "better than new today" because of the experience gained and remembered from the mine hit. <br>
"Princeton, more than most, has an appreciation for warfare and damage control readiness," he said.  "If anything the mine hit brought that into focus." <br>
Sharpe added "the memory of that drives us to a higher damage control standard" and proves how that standard enables Princeton to continue to be; a front-line ship today ready for any mission and a valuable asset to exercises like RIMPAC 96.

<title>Oil cleanup lessons spill over to RIMPAC 96</title>

<h1>Oil cleanup lessons spill over to RIMPAC 96</h1>
<h2>By JO1(SW) S.A. Thornbloom
Pacific Fleet Public Affairs Office</h2>
<hr>
<strong>(Pearl Harbor, HI., May 31, 1996)</strong>-- The black oily crude that crept through and congealed in Pearl Harbor in this month didn't put a stop to RIMPAC 96 or daily Navy operations.  But it did start organizers and Naval Base officials thinking about the what-ifs and what-to-dos if a Navy oiler had run aground during this year's exercise instead of a pipeline breaking at Chevron's Waiau facility.<br>
At a conference in Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard's auditorium last week, officials discussed the recent spill, the lessons learned and how to apply those lessons to future spills that involve the Navy.<br>
"What happened to Chevron could happen (again),'' said Carolyn Winters, a spokeswoman from the Naval Base Environmental Office and coordinator of the conference.<br>
Winters said the Navy has fuel pipelines adjacent to Pearl Harbor and is responsible for Navy and merchant tankers in the harbor.  The Navy also maintains several bulk storage facilities on the Naval Station.<br>
This is why oil-spill response training is always scheduled to be a key component of the exercise.<br>
"What we planned was an area-wide, Naval Base-level, table-top exercise with equipment deployment," Winters said.  "(But) we postponed the oil spill exercise specifically because of the real thing that happened on May 14."<br>
The Naval Base intends to hold a large exercise later this year, she added.<br>
According to Winters, the environmental office and RIMPAC officials were planning to hold a large scale oil spill drill.  The plan had called for the involvement of a fleet vessel, major area Navy commands and participation by elements from Third Fleet.<br>
"The benefit of holding it (the drill) during RIMPAC was to get that fleet involvement," said Winters.  "Third Fleet has also expressed they're interest in elevating environmental concerns and issues within the fleet.  So, ideally, it would have worked well to hold it when we have maximum fleet participation."<br>
During the actual spill last month, several local units did get a chance to participate and see what it's like to respond to a potential environmental disaster.<br>
"We lent out a lot of oil booms, the services of all our crafts and about 15 to 20 people to the cleanup operation,'' said Chief Warrant Officer Mark Pierson, Salvage Department head for Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit 1.  "Oil spills in general are not a part of our mission but in this case we were available and willing to help."<br>
MDSU-1 normally works at salvaging damaged ships that have run aground or have sunk, but according to Winters they were a tremendous help during the Chevron spill.<br>
"They play a double role,'' she said.  "They've got wonderful diving and salvage expertise and then that 'can do' attitude.  So, having a strong team (like MDSU-1) to supplement the rest of the Navy commands is great; you couldn't ask for more."<br>
But becoming a strong team means training and RIMPAC plays an important part in providing an exercise big enough for MDSU-1 to ply their trade.<br>
"The big part (of RIMPAC) is the learning phase and once you get through the learning phase then everything else will just fall right into place," said Hull Technician 1st Class Donovan Motley, who explained that in RIMPAC, MDSU-1 was scheduled to salvage a ship that had sunk and was blocking the harbor.<br>
And salvaging a ship that has sunk or run aground means emptying the ship of fuel or oil to lighten the vessels to raise or move it.  To many MDSU-1 members, that's why they get calls to respond to harbor spills.<br>
"Right here at this point of the harbor, (on Hickam Air Fore Base) we're the quickest asset the Navy has for an oil spill,'' said Motley.<br>
To MDSU-1 commanding officer, Cmdr. Mike Freeman, being able to respond quickly when called upon is extremely important to the entire ecological balance of Pearl Harbor and a concern for everyone who travels around it.<br>
"It's very important to the environment. Whenever there's quick response to save a ship that's run aground or had a collision with another ship we're here to take care of those ships.  We're well trained and we practice those skills routinely so that when they need us we're ready," said Freeman.<br>
Being ready is also one of the major lessons learned at the conference, and according to Winters.  Another is becoming "one Navy" on the afloat and shore sides so that everyone is working as one unit to combat and manage the spill, she said.<br>
"So we need to train, exercise and always be ready to respond to a spill in a very effective manner."<br>
Winters hopes Sailors will remember the ugliness of the slick and thick, black sludge creep toward the Arizona Memorial and Naval Station and why it's important to the environment for everyone "to respond quickly and go to war against this type of disaster."<br>

<title>USS Princeton a temporary workplace For five nations' sailors</title>

<h1>USS Princeton a temporary workplace for five nations' sailors</h1>
<h2>by JO2 Andrew Cramer<br>
Pacific Fleet Public Affairs Office</h2>
<hr>
<strong>(Pearl Harbor, HI., June 5,1996)</strong>--From the pier and even onboard, the USS Princeton (CG-59) looks like just about any other Aegis cruiser.  But a closer look reveals sailors in uniforms very different from the U.S. Navy's and even languages not usually heard aboard a U.S. ship.<br>
That's par for the course, however, for the headquarters ship of RIMPAC 96's Multi-National Force (MNF).<br>
The MNF commander, Royal Australian Navy <a href="ranaobio.htm">Rear Adm. Chris Oxenbould</a>, is guiding U.S., Australian, Canadian, South Korean and Chilean forces from aboard the guided-missile cruiser for the duration of the roughly month-long exercise.<br>
The RIMPAC scenario has the Multi-National Force in opposition to a bi-lateral force composed of U.S. and Japanese assets.<br><a href="r96bout2.htm"><img src="r96bout2.gif" alt="ROK-U.S. Sailors on Princeton" align="right" height=230 width=343></a>
Advance teams from the various countries started arriving May 18 to transform Princeton into a suitable staff headquarters, said Royal Canadian Navy Lt. David Cooke, a battle watch officer on the Princeton.<br>
"It was kind of slow getting set up, trying to keep track of everything and figuring out who was going to do what," Cooke said.  "The U.S. folks had classes set up to help us learn how their systems worked, like for message traffic and communications, and that was very helpful."<br>
Having a versatile command ship like USS Princeton ready to work makes an important exercise like RIMPAC easier to handle, said Chilean navy Lt. Fernando Contreras, another of the MNF's three battle watch leaders.<br>
"Chile does many exercises that are important to us, but RIMPAC is more important because it involves so many more nations," Contreras said.<br>
This is the first time the South American nation is participating in RIMPAC, which started in 1971.<br>
"Anytime we can improve our skills, we try to make the most of it," Contreras said.  "It is nothing but a good thing to get to know people of other navies, because both of us learn, grow and improve as a result."<br>
There's also much to be gained on a personal level as well, sailors say.<br>
Once U.S. Navy Chief Operations Specialist (Surface Warfare) James Chantland started talking to and getting to know the other navies' sailors, no one seemed so foreign anymore.<br>
"There's not that much of a difference between us when you get right down to it," he said.<br>
South Korean battle watch officer Lt. j.g. Lee Sunz-Han said South Korea has participated in the biennial exercise since 1990, but this is his first RIMPAC and things were really confusing the first few days.<br><a href="mnfpos.htm"><img src="mnfpos.gif" alt="U.S. & Chilean Navy Sailors" align="left" height=421 width=300></a>
"Getting to know everyone and how things work on a staff command was the most difficult part," Lee said.  "Now that I do understand, thanks to the U.S. Navy crew and other officers from all countries involved, things are going much smoother.<br>
"For example, when there was a word or phrase I did not understand, one of my new shipmates was always there to help me through."<br>
USS Princeton isn't really set up specifically to be a command ship, Chantland said.<br>
"A big reason behind us being chosen was scheduling," he said.  The cruiser finished its last deployment to the Persian Gulf in October 1995.<br>
The ship also has a large communications suite and enough extra room for all the meetings, he added.<br>
That extra room and great communications set-up is what made USS Princeton ideal for the command ship platform, said Royal Australian Navy Lt. Cmdr. John Rourke, also a battle watch officer.<br>
"We need to maintain good feedback with all the ships out at sea," Rourke said, "and (those) ships tell us that the communication has been good."<br><a href="cg59fact.htm"><img src="cg59.gif" alt="USS Princeton (CG 59)" align="right" height=255 width=400></a>
Technology aside, "there have been a few teething problems as far as languages and different interpretations of the same word go," he said.  "But we are working well together."<br>
Rourke credits Princeton's crew with enabling the different nations to work together so well.<br>
"They really bent over backwards for us and have given more than they should have."<br>

<title>Multi-national group of Navy Meteorologists participate in RIMPAC 96 </title>

<h1>Multi-national group of Navy Meteorologists participate in<br>RIMPAC 96</h1>

<hr>
<strong>(Pearl Harbor, HI., June 5, 1996)</strong>-- One of the keys to RIMPAC 96's success is beyond anyone's control: The weather.<br>
But that doesn't mean it's being ignored.  On the contrary, it is being continuously monitored by folks at the Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center (NAVPACMETOCCEN) Pearl Harbor.  <br>
During the exercise, U.S. Navy and Royal Australian Navy personnel will be continuously watching for storms and rough seas and reporting this data 24 hours a day to the participating ships at sea.  A large portion of RIMPAC's mission success relies on what the forecasters tell the fleet.<br>
"There are two different cells (of forecasters)," said Royal Australian Navy Lt. Cmdr. Craig Roy. "One is the Combined METOC Forecasting Unit, sponsored by  NAVPACMETOCCEN, set up to support the (Multi-National Force and Bi-Lateral Force).  They're producing area forecasts and tactical forecasts for both forces upon request."<br>
The other cell consists of seagoing meteorological and oceanography representatives, said Roy, combined METOC officer for the Multi-National Forces (MNF) and oceanographer with the Australian navy's Maritime Headquarters.<br>
Representatives are onboard HMAS Perth (DDG-38), HMCS Algonquin (DDGH-38), USS Essex (LHD-2), USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63), USS Cushing (DD-985), USS Cowpens (CG-63) and USS Kamehameha (SSN-642).  Some are also stationed at Special Operations Task Force on Ford Island, Naval Air Station Barbers Point and Hickam Air Force Base.<br>
"The attachments we have at sea come from the U.S. Navy, the Royal Australian Navy and the Canadian navy," Roy said.  <br>
There are several products established for RIMPAC, including a homepage set up by the center to provide real-time information for safety and tactical purposes, he said.  <br>
There are also a number of special tactical oceanographic information charts to give amphibious forces and ships operating in coastal waters highly detailed information about particular landing areas.<br>
"Satellite photographic imagery on coastal areas helps enhance meteorological and oceanographic features," said Lt. Cmdr. Bruce Hagaman, staff oceanographer for Commander, Cruiser Destroyer Group One, stationed on the San Diego-based aircraft carrier USS Constellation.  "(Oceanographic) experts add known features such as currents, tides and shoals, and put that together on a large color photographic image of the coastal area to be used in amphibious warfare planning or other coastal activities."<br>
This data is provided to all the players -- the Marines, the Mine Warfare/Explosive Ordnance Disposal Teams, the Special Operations Task Force -- so they can plan different operations throughout the course of RIMPAC.<br>
Roy and Hagaman are working together for the first time in RIMPAC exercises.  The Australian navy and U.S. Navy meteorologists have joined together to learn how each other operates and look forward to improving their weather forecasting techniques. <br>
"We're developing a very good rapport with other nations," Roy said.  "There's (an Australian navy) officer working closely with a U.S. Navy officer; and both navies are also integrating with the Canadians, South Koreans and Chileans as well.<br>
"We hope to learn from each other and become better trained after the exercises to handle any joint or combined contingency."

<title>Reservists Provide 'Real World' Support for RIMPAC 96</title>

<h1>Reservists Provide 'Real World' Support for RIMPAC 96</h1>
<h2>By JO1 Catherine Kurchinski
RIMPAC Command Information Bureau</h2>
<hr>
<strong>(HICKAM AIR FORCE BASE, Hawaii, June 5, 1996)</strong>-- Naval Reservists are playing a key role in the largest maritime exercise in the world -- RIMPAC 96. Members of three Naval Overseas Air Cargo Terminal Units (NOACT), and VP-66, Willow Grove, are keeping the logistics pipeline flowing for more than 40 ships from six Pacific nations, including the U.S., Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan and the Republic of Korea. NOACT units involved are NOACT E208; NOACT G113, Springfield, Mo.; and NOACT C213, Lincoln, Neb. NOACT E208 arrived in May to help establish a Forward Logistics Support Site, based at Hickam Air Force in Honolulu, Hawaii.<br>
"We deliver cargo, mail, personnel and repair parts to the fleet," said Lieutenant Commander Tom Welke, skipper of the Atlanta unit. "Mail and repair parts are delivered within 24 hours to the ships involved in the exercise. Sailors are particularly happy to receive mail on a timely basis."<br>
<a href="malhndlr.htm"><img src="malhndlr.gif" align="left" height=461 width=300></a>
Welke's unit handles some 7,000 pounds of mail and 60,000 pounds of cargo daily. RIMPAC 96, conducted every two  years, improves coordination and interoperability and joint forces in maritime tactical and theater operations.<br>
"This is an outstanding training opportunity for all NOACT personnel; it allows us to provide substantial real-world support," said Welke. <br>
Providing support to forward Navy installations and deployed ships is not new for Naval Reserve NOACTS. During Operation Desert Shield/Storm, five NOACTS performed missions at Forward Logistics Support Sites in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt. NOACTS proved critical in supporting air cargo operations at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, during Haitian and Cuban refugee crises in 1994. <br>
Because of past successes and increased visibility, the number of NOACTS increased from five in 1991, to 13 today. Two Naval Reserve NOACTS are located in Atlanta; others are based in Charleston, S.C.; Greenville, S.C.; Knoxville, Tenn.; Lincoln, Neb.; Omaha, Neb.; Minneapolis, Minn.; Savannah, Ga.; Kansas City, Mo.; Springfield, Mo.; Sacramento, Calif.; and Oklahoma City, Okla.<br>
<br>

<title>A-6E involved in gunnery exercise accident</title>
<h1>RIMPAC 96</h1>
<h2>A-6E Intruder involved in ship-to-air gunnery exercise accident</h2>
<h3>Pilot and navigator eject safely as plane crashes in Pacific</h3>
<hr>

<strong>(Pearl Harbor, Hi., June 4, 1996)</strong>--A U.S. <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navpalib/factfile/aircraft/air-a6.html">A-6E "Intruder"</a> jet aircraft towing a target for ship-to-air gunnery practice apparently was damaged inadvertently by gunfire from a Japanese destroyer and crashed
in the Pacific Ocean about 1,600 miles west of Hawaii.  Both crew members of the aircraft ejected and were recovered in good condition.<br>
The accident took place at 4:15 p.m. local time, June 3 (7:15 p.m. in Hawaii and 1:15 a.m. EDT, June 4) in the course of a mid-Pacific exercise called “RIMPAC 96.”  Five “rim of the Pacific” nations besides the United States are taking part in this training from May 22 through June 21.  The officer in overall command of the exercise is Vice Adm. Conrad C. Lautenbacher Jr., U.S. Navy, commander of the U.S. Third Fleet.<br>
The accident involved the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force ship <a href="dd153.htm">JDS Yuugiri</a>, a 450-foot long, 3,550-ton destroyer engaged in training with other Japanese and U.S. ships as they move from Japan toward waters off Hawaii.  The A-6 aircraft was assigned to Attack Squadron 115 operating from the aircraft carrier USS Independence.  The ship and squadron are
forward-based in Japan and are among the U.S. forces taking part in RIMPAC.<br>
When the accident occurred, the aircraft was towing a target drone -- a missile about 5-feet long and a foot in diameter -- for gunnery practice by Yuugiri’s <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navpalib/factfile/weapons/wep-phal.html">close-in weapons systems</a>, a high rate-of-fire gun.  The crew of the A-6 lost control of their aircraft.  They ejected successfully and were picked up by a small boat from the Japanese ship.  With no serious injuries, they subsequently were transferred by helicopter back to the carrier Independence.<br>
The pilot’s name is Lt. Cmdr. William E. Royster, 33, of Kansas City, Mo.
The bombadier/navigator is Lt. Keith A. Douglas, 30, of Birmingham, Ala.<br>
U.S. and Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force authorities are investigating the accident.<br>

<hr>
<strong>(Pearl Harbor, HI., May 31, 1996)</strong>-- Pearl Harbor's Richardson Field caught fire last week.<br>
However, there were no fire trucks needed. This fire was put out with Gatorade. <br>
Chile's "red-hot" soccer team from CS Lynch (FF 07) "burned" a determined Australian HMAS Perth (DDG 38) soccer team in the final minute of the RIMPAC Soccer Tournament's championship game. Lynch's Cpl. Juan Valencia kicked the winning goal to defeat the "Aussies" in a midday sun that threatened to take victims of its own.<br><a href="soccer2.htm"><img src="soccer2.gif" alt=" RAN defender kicks the ball past Chilean player" align="right" height=293 width=400></a>
Sportsmanship prevailed over the "heat of competition" when the gracious Chilean victors chanted and clapped as the Perth team received their second place trophies. "It was very difficult because the Australian team as you know are very physical," said Pedro Tirapegui Ceron, a Lynch player. "They were also very friendly and they played fair."<br>
Soccer was only one of the five sporting events that "ignited" Pearl Harbor for this year's istallment of RIMPAC Sports Tournament, sponsored by MCI Telecommunications. One-hundred and four teams representing six countries clashed in basketball, softball, sand volleyball, indoor volleyball and soccer. <br><a href="soccer1.htm"><img src="soccer1.gif" alt="U.S. player headers ball past RAN defender" align="right" height=338 width=320></a>
"The competition was fierce," exclaimed Frank DelGaudio, Fleet Recreation Coordinator since 1986, who dashed from event to event to hand out trophies. "Each RIMPAC, the players seem more intense than the previous one. It's amazing that many of the teams are formed just to compete in this tournament and show a tremendous ability to come together and work as a team. If the actual RIMPAC exercise is anything like this, I believe the participants take their work very seriously."<br>
About the same time the soccer championship was decided on Richardson Field, Bloch Arena was "set ablaze" when USS Cimmaron's (AO 177) basketball team "extinguished" any hope USS Essex's (LHD 02) had of a victory in the basketball final. Cimmaron worked their way past 24 teams and beat Essex 41 to 32 in the championship.<br>
"They (Essex) beat us twice earlier in the season," said Engineman 3rd Class John James. "We went into the semi-finals as the underdogs, but we didn't feel that way. We played at the top of our game and came out on top, because we did a good job on defense."<br><a href="bsktball.htm"><img src="bsktball.gif" alt="Fast break" align="left" height=360 width=250></a>
Other RIMPAC tournament highlights included a softball championship that was hard for the USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 49) team to pull off against USS Lake Erie's (CG 70) team, but the 15-11 victory over the Lake Erie team yielded a handsome first-place trophy for the Harpers Ferry team.<br>
USS Leftwich's (DD 984) 4-man Sand Volleyball team spiked, blocked and dug their way to a 11-2, 9-11, and 11-7 victory over the PMT/CSS-1 team to "net" a first-place finish.<br>
Subase Gym became a "towering inferno," when USS Willamette's (AO 180) Indoor Volleyball team "snuffed out" USS Ingersoll's (DD 990) eight-man volleyball team.<br>
RIMPAC '96 is a communication and coordination exercise. RIMPAC '96 Sports Tournament was more than "just exercise" for the 500 "fired-up" participants.<br>

<h1>Marines lend a hand in Waimea</h1>
<h2>School playgrounds, WWII Marine memorial, local food bank benefit</h2>
<h3>by Cpl. Marc Ayalin, USMC</h3>
<hr>
<strong>(Pohakuloa Training Area, HI., May 27, 1996)</strong> -- Marines from Battalion Landing Team, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment volunteered their services to the city of Waimea, Hawaii May 27, as part of a three-phase community relations project to benefit residents in the local community.<br>
The project was headed by Chaplain (LCdr.) Chin Van Dang, 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, and Chaplain (Lt.) William M. Middleton, BLT 3/1, both of whom brought together Marines and two Navy Religious Programmers from various detachments throughout the BLT 3/1 to assist in the project's tasks. <br>
The project involved painting and restoring safety areas and playground facilities at the Waimea Elementary and Intermediate School and beautifying the Camp Tarawa Memorial, a large plaque embedded in stone signifying the 2nd and 5th Marine Divisions' efforts during World War II. In addition, food donations to "The Island of Hawaii Food Bank" were coordinated to the benefit of more than 60 charities throughout the island of Hawaii.<br>
"Part of the Chaplain's and RP's job is to organize these community relations projects to benefit both the military and the local community," said RP3 Joseph M. McCoy, 11th MEU.<br>
The first job took place May 25, as a group of five Marines and Sailors spent the day  sprucing up the Camp Tarawa Memorial by cleaning and polishing its metallic exterior. Inscribed on the memorial read, "Camp Tarawa 1943-1945. The 2nd and 5th Marine Divisions. Trained here to bring peace to the Pacific." <br>
The second project became the day's highlight as a group of 15 Marines and Sailors gathered at the school at 9 a.m. Sunday, May 26, to begin painting yellow safety striping on all walkways, curbs and other high risk areas such as the stairways leading to several classrooms. During the painting, Marines also spiced up the playground area for the children by repainting the lines of an old game of "Four Square" and creating three more along a wide cement pathway.   <br>
"I think we saved the school a lot of money," said RP2 John K. Simokat, BLT 3/1. "I also think that the kids will have many hours of fun from the work we did."<br>
Some of the Marines were glad that they had a chance to do work that benefitted the school.<br>
"It feels good to do something for the community we're defending," said LCpl. Brian M. Dite, D Co., 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance. "It's not often we get to do something for the community and when you do, it makes a big impact."	<br>
This painting job wasn't the first time Marines were called to give the school a hand. <br>
"In the past, the Marines have done land clearing, grubbing and leveling to create additional playground space," said Art Souza, Assisitant principal of the school. "Discussions for future work include plans to build an adult size softball field for joint community and school use."<br>
At the end of the day, members of the school's staff showed their appreciation to the volunteers by throwing a small picnic consisting of sandwiches, chips, Hawaiian iced tea and a Polynesian delight, strawberry/guava nectar.   <br>
On May 28, at the Pohakuloa Training Area, food donations to the IHFB kicked off as Marines loaded a truck with unused food portions from Meals Ready to Eat, canned goods, and produce. Items included;  2,000 1-ounce packets of apple jelly, 1,800 1-ounce packets of grape jelly, 5,000 1.5-ounce packages of peanut butter, 4,140 2 gram packets of coffee, four cans of corn and 25 pounds of fresh green peppers.<br>
"The food bank liked the donations of MREs because those items don't need refrigeration and some of the needy don't have any refrigerators," said Steve Trout, PTA Operations Officer.<br>
Some of the needy are former military personnel who live in remote places far away from town and are too proud to ask for help. One good thing that the IHFB does for them is personally deliver the food when there is any available, explained Trout. <br>
s the 11th MEU continues to prepare for an upcoming six month deployment in September, its Marines and Sailors will continue to foster good community relations by participating in more restoration projects like those at Waimea.<br>

<title>RIMPAC 96: Scout teams and Light Armor learn to work together</title>

<h1>Fire & Maneuver:</h1>
<h2>Scout teams and Light Armor learn to work together</h2>
<h3>by Cpl. Marc Ayalin, USMC</h3>
<hr>
<strong>(Pohakuloa Training Area, HI., May 25, 1996)</strong> -- The sound of machine-gun fire echoed across the range May 25, as a five-man team of scouts from Delta Co., 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, crouched down to witness their foe's destruction during a fire and maneuver exercise for RIMPAC '96. <br>
The exercise was part of a six week training evolution for Battalion Landing Team, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, preparing for a six-month Western Pacific Deployment with the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit in September. The daylong event brought more than 90 Marines and Sailors together to work out section coordination between Light Armored Vehicle support and scout fire and maneuver tactics.<br>
"The mission of our scout teams is to provide local security for our vehicles and conduct long range patrols," said SSgt. Thomas A. Brown, 1st Platoon Sergeant, D Co., LAR. <br>
During long range patrols, scout teams may come in contact with the enemy and be unable to repel fire without the aid or support of their mechanized counterparts. At the Army's expansive training facility, the Marines were able to hone coordination skills. <br>
The 800-meter course featured manually operated pop-up targets positioned at various locations along the range. It also featured several propane-filled tanks rigged to simulate machine-gun and mortar fire when triggered by a course controller. <br>
After receiving a safety brief, the first team of five scouts boarded an LAV and entered the range. 200 meters down range, the scout team exited the vehicle and began their arduous journey on foot. Quietly, the team maneuvered through the lavic micro-terrain indigenous of Hawaii's Pohakuloa Training Area. Over small mounds of lava rocks and passing the dried bushes of the range, the team came in contact with the enemy for the first time. Four full-figured silhouetted pop-up targets appeared 50 meters away including one moving target which traveled left to right.<br>
The sound of simulated machine-gun fire filled the air as the course operator triggered the propane tanks. The scout team scurried to find cover and concealment from the nearest mound or bush. Suddenly, the team leader shouted, "Right fire team - rush!" The assault was on. As two Marines ran toward the objective, others provided cover. Down went one target and then another, but the targets reappeared to simulate a larger opposition force. <br>
As the Marines got closer, the controller slowed down the targets' repetition. Then, almost at once he ceased the target's movement. The fire fight was over for now.<br>
Not a minute passed when suddenly the team began receiving enemy fire from their left flank. The team took cover and returned fire, but this time it was too much and the team leader had to call in for vehicle support. Hastily, he popped a can of green smoke to signal the vehicles while at the same time telling his Marines to stay down.<br>
Two LAVs moved up from the rear and took position before firing down range. Upon confirming the scouts' position, the two vehicles engaged the enemy with their 7.62 mm coaxial machine-guns.<br>
"I try to keep my fire suppression as accurate as possible so the scouts can advance or find another position," said LCpl. Craig A. Comello, an LAV crewman and gunner.<br>
One minute later the team leader popped a can of yellow smoke to signal a cease fire in order to continue the assault. Aggresively, two Marines ran toward the objective while the rest of their fire team covered them with gunfire. Leapfrogging towards the enemy and using rocks and bushes for cover and concealment, the fire team stopped 25 feet from the bunker and some trenches to prepare for their attack.<br> 
"Attack!" shouted the team leader.<br>
Like a scene from the Civil War, the Marines charged at the enemy's position across an open field firing a barrage of rounds towards the trenches. As they approached the stronghold the Marines spit rounds into the trenches to kill the enemy. The fire team had no casualties to report and the enemy was overrun. After regrouping, the team proceeded to move forward in their original direction. <br>
About 300 meters away, eight targets appeared in the distance and in between another bunker began simulating firing rounds. Once again the green smoke was used and the LAVs suppressed the enemy. This time the distance was much longer and the Marines had to rush along  more rugged terrain. <br>
"This course is the most challenging by far since I've been in the Marine Corps," said LCpl.  Joseph V. Enzensperger, D Co., 1st Plt. "I've never done a course with so much distance."<br>
After the LAVs ceased fire, the team began leapfrogging again across the range while Marines covered each other with automatic fire. As they approached their final objective, the team leader shouted for the Marines to attack. With one last breath, the Marines screamed their war cries and charged the enemy's last stronghold for the final time. <br>
Upon taking the bunker, the Marines set up in a defensive posture in case there were any additional hostilities. Behind the bunker, the team laid in the prone position while the team leader called to be extracted from their position. Suddenly, 10 pop-up targets appeared another 200 meters down range. The hard chargers of Delta Company maintained fire and suppression until they could be picked up.<br>
When the LAVs arrived, two men got in one vehicle while being covered by their fellow Marines. The rest proceeded as the LAV's guns sent a massive barrage of steel rain upon the enemy. Within seconds the vehicles were off and the course was complete. <br>
Throughout the day, the rest of D Company ran through the course, hitting, rolling, coordinating fires with the LAVs and practicing small unit fire and maneuvers. In the end, the Marines had gained a new perspective about their combat skills.<br>
"I' ve gained more confidence in controlling my team during the assault on the objectives," said LCpl. Hank W. Eddy, 1st Plt., D Co.

<title>Harbor Tugs Support RIMPAC Break Out</title>

<h1>Pearl Harbor tugboat crews help RIMPAC ships "breakout"</h1>
<h2>JO1(SW) S.A. Thornbloom</h2>
<hr>
<strong>(Pearl Harbor, May 23, 1996)</strong>--When 19 ships “broke out” of Pearl Harbor last week to begin the first phase of RIMPAC 96, a key to the operation was a small fleet of tugboats from Pearl Harbor’s Service Craft Unit.<br>
It’s a fleet that doesn’t get as much attention or recognition as the aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates and other ships participating in this year’s exercise, but any harbor observer can see that the tugs are very important to RIMPAC.<br>
From before dawn to dusk, the tiny tugs swirled about, churning up the harbor bottom as they safely guided the larger vessels to open sea.<br>
“It’s a good experience to be a part of it (RIMPAC),” said Seaman Elizabeth Hupf, from Medford, Ore., a crew member aboard tugboat Tuskeegee (YTB-806).  “With all these countries being here and to be able to see it all is great, but it’s still just a part of our job.”<br>
According to Tuskeegee’s crew, pushing and pulling the massive tonnage of naval vessels out to sea during RIMPAC’s port breakout made for a very busy day.<br>
“It’s more hectic,’’ said Chief Boatswain’s Mate Rex Cain, driver and captain of Tuskeegee.  “Usually when there’s a lot of ships moving, we just do one right after the other so it can be more difficult.”<br>
To another Tuskeegee crew member, Seaman Carrie Jackson of Las Vegas, Nev., “Just being able to work together and get things done makes the work go by faster.”<br>
But even while the work goes by faster, the day can still be very long during a port breakout.<br>
Tuskeegee’s nine-member crew, along with crews aboard the unit’s four other tugs, started their day before dawn on the day of the breakout.<br>
At 5 a.m., the crew prepped Tuskeegee to get underway. By 6 a.m., the tug was guiding a submarine, USS San Francisco (SSN-711), to an ammunition pier.<br>
Then, one after another, the armada of RIMPAC ships were escorted away from their moorings and out to sea.  From USS Antietam (CG-54) and USS Essex (LHD-2) to HMAS Sydney and HMCS Winnipeg -- whether the ships were American, Canadian or Australian --  the tug pushed and pulled, guiding the larger ships into Pearl Harbor’s open channel.<br>
“I always try to think of three or four moves ahead on a day like today,” said Cain, a native of Helena, Mont., who has been driving his tug around Pearl Harbor for three years.  “If you don’t look ahead, you’ll get to the ship and think ‘What do I do now?’ ”<br>
Cain added that a part of looking ahead is thinking about the easiest and safest way to handle a ship.<br>
“Usually it’s whatever the harbor pilot wants us to do,” he said.  “The pilot makes the call on whether we’ll do a headline or stern tow.  I just try to be prepared for what they may tell us to do.”<br>
A “stern tow” -- where the tow line goes over the tug’s stern -- is better because “a tug has more power going forward than pulling in reverse on a headline,” Cain said.  But a stern tow is also more dangerous because there’s a greater chance of the line snapping.<br>
Regardless of the method, Tuskeegee’s crew relies on teamwork.<br>
“We really trust each and know each other well on a personal level as well as a work level,” said Seaman Dancie Freeman, from Douglasville, Ga.<br>
Cain said his crew of six women and two men “work together very well as a team.  And they know what the team concept is and they understand it.  You don’t hear a lot of squabbling or bickering.”<br>
Although most RIMPAC 96 ships are now operating at sea, the tugs of Service Craft Unit will keep busy guiding non-RIMPAC participants in, out and around the harbor.  But toward the end of June, Cain said, his team of Sailors will be ready for even more long, hectic days aboard Tuskeegee when the exercise’s ships all return to port.<br>

<title>RIMPAC 96 gets underway</title>

<h1>RIMPAC 96 gets underway<br>
with "port breakout"</h1>
<h2>by JO2 Andrew Cramer</h2><br>
<hr>
<strong>PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii, May 23, 1996 </strong> -- Nearly 20 ships and submarines from five nations sailed out of Pearl Harbor Thursday in response to a simulated enemy threat.<br>
Frigates, oilers, amphibious assault ships and destroyers -- carefully moved out of the harbor as part of a "port breakout" in Exercise Rim of the Pacific.<br>
Knowing how to avoid a threat is key in any warfare situation, said Ensign Neil Willmann, public affairs officer aboard USS Reid (FFG-30).<br>
"A `port breakout’ is necessary when a battle group gets word that an area outside their port is a threat, whether it’s from an enemy plane, ship or sub," Willmann said.<br>
"The group commanders have to find a way to get their fleet out of port and either avoid or destroy the enemy threat before the threat can do damage to a ship."<br>
In Thursday’s simulation, the nation of Pacifica received word that an enemy sub from the nation of Capmid was patrolling the waters outside Pearl Harbor.<br>
One by one, each ship from the battle group slid out the harbor’s channel with a specific task to accomplish and a specific area to patrol, said Royal Australian Navy Cmdr. James Goldrick, executive officer for the guided-missile destroyer HMAS Perth.<br>
"Giving each ship an exact function within an exercise will give you a clearer picture of what to expect if all of us ever had to do this for real," Goldrick said.<br>
The first ships and subs to reach the open sea formed a defense net around the harbor’s mouth to protect the most important ship in the group, or the High Value Unit (HVU), from the enemy threat, according to Willmann.<br>
"Once the other ships firmly establish their position, they signal the HVU that it is safe to exit the port," he said.<br>
The amphibious assault ship USS Essex (LHD-2) served as the HVU, said the ship’s public affairs officer, Lt. Cmdr. Julia Spinelli.<br>
"Usually a carrier will be the center of a battle group," Spinelli said.  "Since neither of the two carriers (that are participating in RIMPAC), USS Independence or USS Kitty Hawk, are here yet, Essex is the next most important asset."<br>
Once the HVU has moved to the center of the defense net, the entire group sails off in formation to its destination, sometimes while still trying to locate the enemy threat, Spinelli said.<br>
Goldrick compared RIMPAC to a symbiotic relationship.<br>
"We learn just as much about other nations’ ways and means as they learn about us," he said.  "It is very much a mutually beneficial relationship.<br>
"By practicing in a demanding environment, naval forces gain clearer communication, and thereby, a more close-knit relationship."<br>
More than 40 ships, 250 aircraft and 30,000 military personnel will be involved in RIMPAC 96.  In addition to the United States, military personnel from Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan and South Korea are participating.  The exercise will last until June 21.<br>

<title>Chilean Navy Celebrates Navy Day during RIMPAC 96</title>

<h1>Chilean Navy celebrates Chilean Navy Day in Hawaii during<br>RIMPAC 96</h1>
<h2>by JO3 Dean Nazario</h2>
<hr>
<strong>(Pearl Harbor, Hi., May 23, 1996)</strong>--Every seagoing nation has history of naval battles won and lost and heroes who are honored and remembered each year.<br>
This year, Sailors from two Chilean ships celebrated their "Navy Day" while in port Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, during their first participation in Exercise Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC 96).  These Sailors are joining 30,000 Sailors and Marines from six nations to improve cooperation and interoperability at sea.<br>
Sailors and officers of the frigate Almirante Lynch (PFG-07) and submarine SS Simpson hosted a Chilean Navy Day reception in Pearl Harbor May 21 for the Chilean community in Honolulu; RIMPAC Sailors from four other nations, including Australia, Canada, the Republic of Korea and the United States; and local Hawaiian community members.<br>
"The Chilean Navy was born with the Republic of Chile in 1818," said Capt. Cristian Gantes, commanding officer of Almirante Lynch.<br>
Chile declared Navy Day May 21 a national holiday in 1915 to commemorate the naval battles of Iquique (north coast) and Punta Gruesa during a war that Chile fought against Peru and Bolivia in 1879.<br>
"In the Battle of Iquique, our major naval hero, Cmdr. Arturo Prat, commanding officer of the corvette Esmeralda, was killed after boarding an enemy vessel in an attempt to take the ship," Gantes said.   "He died with 140 of his men."<br>
Chilean ships maintained a blockade of the then Peruvian port of Iquique.   In the early morning of May 21, 1879 the two weakest units of the Chilean Fleet - Esmeralda and Covadonga -- engaged the strongest units of the Peruvian Fleet -- the steamship monitor Huascar and the ironclad Independencia.<br>
"Boys the contest is unequal," Prat said to his crew.  "Our flag has never been lowered before the enemy, and I hope this isn't the occasion for that to happen.  As long as I live that flag will be in its place (on top of the mast)."<br>
The Chileans put up a strong fight and refused to surrender.  Impatient with the long struggle, the Huascar bore down full steam on the Esmeralda and rammed the ship.<br>
"In order to maintain the blockade, Prat decided to board the Huascar," Gantes said.  Prat ran a few steps toward the bridge, but was shot and killed by an enemy sailor.<br>
The Huascar rammed the Esmeralda two more times before sinking the Chilean ship, but the crew continued fighting under Prat's orders.  Only 59 of Esmerelda's Sailors were saved, but their effort was not in vain.  The last object to disappear was the Chilean flag firmly fastened to the mast.<br>
"It was very important at that time," Gantes said, because this battle united the Chilean people into supporting the war effort.  "The way that Prat died with those men was recognized even by the enemy."<br>
At the end of the combat, the Covadonga managed to ground the Independencia and force a surrender.  The Huascar was later captured on October 8, 1879.  "The Huascar is still afloat to this day and resides in Talcahuano, Chile," Gantes said.<br>
"It's (Navy Day) a holiday because the Chilean people realize their navy played an important role in the past, and they commemorate the war heroes who led the country to victory," Gantes said.  "It's a big celebration all over Chile with military and civilian ceremonies and school parades."<br>
In addition, the new Esmeralda, a tall sail training ship, normally pays port visits to Pearl Harbor during her training cruises around the world.<br>
"Chile Navy Day is important to us because the navy and the Chilean people remember our heroes," said S1 Raul Ramirez, Almirante Lynch mechanical electrical technician.<br>
The ships arrived in Pearl Harbor earlier this month, and this is the first time the Chilean units will be participating in RIMPAC 96.<br>
"We are increasing our naval participation with the United States," Gantes said.  "It is important to the Chilean navy to project power in the Pacific theater.  To that end, we must maintain a naval presence here and be ready to participate in peacekeeping missions."<br>
The Chilean Navy has participated in past exercises with the United States, and the Aegis cruiser USS Vincennes (CG-49) is currently in Chile conducting a joint exercise.<br>
"This demonstrates the increased participation with the U.S. Navy," Gantes said.<br>
Gantes hopes the Chilean navy can learn more about operating in a multi-national force and contribute to interoperability.<br>
"Interoperability is not something that can be worked out on paper," he said.  "You have to physically participate in the exercise, communicate and train effectively with other navies."<br>

<title>Foreign Navies Participate in RIMPAC 96</title>

<h1>Foreign Navies Participate in RIMPAC 96</h1>
<h2>by JO3 Dean Nazario</h2>
<hr>
<strong>(1996)</strong>--The U.S. Navy, Royal Australian Navy, and the navies of Chile, Canada, Japan and Republic of Korea will participate in RIMPAC 96.<br>
As in past RIMPAC exercises, forces are divided into two groups -- U.S. and Japanese units will form the Bilateral Force (BIF), and the other countries along with units from the United States will form the Multi-National Force (MNF).<br>
<h3>Australia</h3>
The Royal Australian Navy has participated in of each of the 15 RIMPAC exercises, which began in 1971.  Four of their ships are in Pearl Harbor to participate in Exercise RIMPAC 96.<br>
The four ships arrived in Pearl Harbor, in mid-May, led by Rear Adm. C. J. Oxenbould, Australia's maritime commander and head of RIMPAC's Multi-National Force.  The ships are Perth (DD-38), Newcastle (FFG-06), Sydney (FFG-03) and Success (AOR-304).<br>
Some of the RIMPAC training to be accomplished in Hawaiian waters this year include a missile exercise at the Pacific Missile Range Facility, Barking Sands, Kauai.<br>
"They (the exercises) give us a chance to operate not only with the U.S. Navy but also with other nations we don't normally have a chance to operate with," Muller said.  "We see it as a way of cooperating with friendly forces in the Pacific."<br>
Also participating are various Royal Australian Air Force aircraft including P-3Cs and F-111s, two Special Air Service Regiment patrols and a mine countermeasure clearance diving team.<br>
"The objective we hope to achieve from RIMPAC is to maintain our high standards of operations, maintain and improve our training techniques and improve interoperability," said five-time RIMPAC sailor Lt. Andrew Jackman, warfare officer with HMAS Newcastle.<br>
<h3>Chile</h3>
Although this is the first time Chilean naval forces are taking part in RIMPAC, the South American nation has recently participated in several bilateral exercises with the U.S. Third Fleet.  Cmdr. Cristian Gantes Young, commanding officer of the PFG Almirante Lynch, will lead the Chilean forces.<br>
PFG Almirante Lynch is a Leander class, general-purpose frigate built in Scotland and commissioned in 1974.  In February 1975, it arrived at the Chilean port of Punta Arenas and joined a squadron in Valparaiso.<br>
The Lynch is the Chilean navy's third ship to bear that name.  It honors the 
memory of Vice Adm. Patricio Lynch Solo De Zaldivar, one of the most distinguished men in Chilean naval and military history.<br>
The steam turbine-driven ship holds a crew of 267 officers and enlisted men.
Joining the Lynch for RIMPAC is the "O"-class diesel-electric submarine SS Simpson, which used to be the U.S. Navy's USS SPOT until it was turned over to Chile in 1962.<br>
Simpson is the third submarine of the Chilean navy to bear the name of Vice Admiral Roberto Simpson, the Chilean fleet's commander in chief around 1830.  It has a crew of nine officers and 37 enlisted men.<br>
<h3>Canada</h3>
Five Canadian ships -- Algonquin (DDGH-283), Protecteur (AOR-509), Winnepeg (FFH-338), Huron (DDGH-281) and Regina (FFH-334) --and five helicopters will take part in RIMPAC 96.  Capt. Glenn Davidson, commander of the Canadian Defense Force's Maritime Operations Group Two, is leading the Canadian Task Group.<br>
The group will be joined by six CF-18 fighters and various other aircraft.  In all, 1,300 Canadian Forces personnel will participate in RIMPAC.  Canada was one of the original RIMPAC participants in 1971, and this year's group is the largest yet.<br>
<h3>Japan</h3>
This is will be the ninth RIMPAC for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.
The JMSDF presence, led by Rear Adm. Hideaki Kaneda, commander of Escort Flotilla Four, will operate in a bi-lateral group with a U.S. aircraft carrier, cruisers and destroyers.<br>
Participating Japanese units include eight destroyers, a submarine, a fleet support ship and a squadron detachment of P-3C Orion patrol aircraft.
The JMSDF's main missions are to defend Japan from maritime invasion and to secure the safety of maritime traffic around the country, which is surrounded by the sea.  Other missions include contributing to a more stable security environment and responding to large-scale disasters.
The JMSDF is capable of conducting a variety of operations, including anti-submarine, anti-aircraft, anti-surface craft, mine laying, electronic warfare and other missions depending on the threat.<br>
<h3>Republic of Korea</h3>
Republic of Korea units have participated in the three previous RIMPAC, and are returning to join the Multi-National Force with Australia, Canada, Chile and some U.S. units.<br>
Capt. Hak Je Cho, commander of Korea's Anti-Submarine Warfare Squadron 51, will retain overall command of ROK forces throughout the exercise.  He also will be leading two frigates, the ROKS Kyungbuk (FF-956) and ROKS Cheju (FF-958).<br>
The Korean navy has its origins in the Korean Coast Guard, created in 1945.  Since then, the ROK navy has strengthened its combat capability by acquiring more ships.  The navy, which started with a few patrol-and-torpedo boats, acquired destroyers in the 1960s and 150 combat vessels and two submarines since 1990.  The navy will have eight submarines by 1998.<br>

<title>Final Exercise for the Intruder</title>
<br>
<br>
<h1>RIMPAC 96</h1>
<h2>A-6E Intruder to retire after RIMPAC 96</h2>
<h3>by JO2 Andrew Cramer</h3>
<hr>

<strong>(Pearl Harbor, Hi., May 22, 1996)</strong>--One last hurrah.<br>
One last bow before the curtain falls.<br>
RIMPAC 96 will be the last major exercise for A-6E Intruders, the carrier-based attack bomber that has seen combat over Vietnam, Libya and Iraq.<br>
"I'm sure they're gonna go out with a bang and carry the fleet like they always have," said Lt. Cmdr. Walter Klein, who was an A-6E bombardier-navigator with attack squadron VA-52 out of Naval Air Station Whidbey Island from 1987-90.<br>
Two attack squadrons will participate in RIMPAC 96:  VA-115 Eagle Halls as part of Carrier Air Wing 5 aboard the USS Independence (CV-62) and VA-95 Green Lizards as part of Carrier Air Wing 11 aboard USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63).<br>
Even though RIMPAC 96 is the last major exercise an A-6E will participate in, its history will keep its memory alive, according to Klein, currently a cruise missile strike planner with the U.S. Pacific Command, headquartered at Camp H.M. Smith in Halawa. <br>
"I'd always wanted to fly A-6s," he said, "and when I got my wings in 1986, I was lucky that was where the Navy put me." <br>
The A-6 became operational in February 1963 as a sub-sonic, all-weather attack aircraft.  The A-6E made its maiden flight in 1970 and was approved for service in December 1972 after further testing.  It can deliver rockets, missiles or up to 28 500-pound bombs.  <br>
The Intruder worked around the clock in Vietnam, conducting attacks on targets with pinpoint accuracy unavailable through any other aircraft available at that time, according to the Defense Department.<br>
In 1986, Navy A-6E Intruders and Air Force FB-111s penetrated the sophisticated Libyan air defense systems in a joint strike against Libyan terrorist-related targets.<br>
The aircraft was also used extensively during the Persian Gulf War, providing precision bombing on a wide range of targets.<br>
"One of the things I remember most about the Intruder was it's incredible range," Klein said.  "Because it was configured to handle extra fuel, it could fly longer than any fighter we’d had."<br>
According to "Jane’s All the World’s Aircraft," the U.S. government originally planned to update the A-6E fleet with the A-6F Intruder II and A-6G.  Congress, however, withdrew funding in fiscal year 1989.<br>
The planes are being phased out because of advancements in technology and electronics, Navy officials said.  Various models of the more-advanced F/A-18 Hornet strike fighter are being used to a greater extent.<br>
"The A-6 is the most potent attack aircraft ever made as far as ability to strike at night," Klein said.  "That's a unique property of it.  While the new F-18's have the advantage of state-of-the-art technology, they aren't as versatile."<br>
The A-6E Intruder also has a few Hollywood films to its credit, most recently "Flight of the Intruder" starring Danny Glover.<br>
"I do not want to see the A-6 go out," Klein said.  "I think it's a mistake to mothball it completely because it could do so many other things.  It's a very sad day."<br><br><center>-USN-</center><br>

<title>RIMPAC 96 Overview</title>

<h1>RIMPAC's Back:</h1>
<h2>1996 Version promise to be bigger and better than ever</h2>
<h3>by JO1(SW) Scott Thornbloom</h3>
<hr>
<strong>(Pearl Harbor, May 22, 1996)</strong>--In the 25 years since the first RIMPAC, the maritime exercise has grown into a truly Rim-of-the-Pacific achievement.<br>
Australia and Canada accepted U.S. invitations to the 1971 RIMPAC.  This year, the world's largest naval exercise will host more than 30,000 service members from six nations, including the South American nation of Chile for the first time.<br>
"The U.S. Pacific Fleet is forging close and positive relationships with the navies of other nations throughout Asia and the Pacific Rim," said Adm. R.J. Zlatoper, the fleet's commander in chief.<br>
"These informal partnerships contribute directly to USCINCPAC's strategy of Cooperative Engagement," he said.  "They also demonstrate that, in the post-Cold War era, the U.S. Navy remains committed to promoting peace, progress and prosperity throughout this vital part of the world."<br>
RIMPAC 96 began Wednesday, May 22, and runs through June 21.  Along with the three original participants, South Korea returns for a fourth consecutive time and Chile is sending a frigate and submarine for their first appearance.  Japan is back for its ninth RIMPAC, participating in the bi-lateral portion of the exercise with the United States.<br>
"Working with other Pacific Rim nations builds a feeling of mutual cooperation," said Vice Admiral Conrad C. Lautenbacher, who commands the U.S. Third Fleet and will serve as the exercise's overall commander from aboard his command and control ship, USS Coronado (AGF-11).  "It builds a sense of stability for all our interests in the various regions of the Pacific.  And it builds cooperation between our navies and other units which are operating in the exercise."<br>
Although the ultimate goal of the exercise has remained the same throughout the years -- to enhance cooperation among Pacific allies and promote stability in the region -- RIMPAC has evolved to reflect changing times.<br>
The first RIMPAC was conceived during the Cold War, when the Soviet threat forced the United States to focus resources on preparing for war on the open sea -- in the "blue water."<br>
Today's naval forces are vastly reshaped to stabilize potential threats and to operate effectively in the seas' shallow "brown water" areas near land, called littoral areas.<br>
<img src="hmasffgs.gif" alt= "" align=left align=middle height=328 width=402>
"RIMPAC 96 is an excellent example of training in the littoral," Lautenbacher said.  "We have included exercises that encompass all facets of littoral warfare; from undersea warfare, surface warfare (and) air warfare, (to) strike and power projection missions across the beach."<br>
Though the Cold War years are now gone, many unstable situations continue to pose potential dangers to the economic and security interests of countries along the Pacific Rim.<br>
With fewer U.S. forces and bases overseas today, forward-deployed naval forces represent the backbone of America's defense and are an indispensable front-line instrument of U.S. foreign policy.<br>
Many of those forward-deployed forces are participating in RIMPAC 96, including the aircraft carrier USS Independence (CV-62), USS Bunker Hill (CG-52), USS Fife (DD-991), USS O'Brien (DD-975), all homeported in Yokosuka, Japan.<br><h3>
</h3>RIMPAC 96 Highlights
This year's RIMPAC will involve more than 44 ships of all types, about 250 aircraft and more than 30,000 personnel.<br>
The exercise will test the coordination and teamwork of the participating naval forces and "it will also include joint operations with our Air Force, and our Coast Guard, and, of course, our Marine Corps," Lautenbacher said.<br>
That becomes all the more important as the branches of the U.S. military continue to look for better ways and more opportunities to operate together.
Operations will take place at a hectic rate on shore, in the air, and on 
and below the ocean surface:
<ul>
<li>In addition to day and night air operations from the carriers Independence and USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63), land-based aircraft will be flying out of Hickam Air Force Base, Naval Air Station Barbers Point and Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Kaneohe Bay.
<li>A mock embassy rescue, similar to the recent one in Liberia, will be staged. 
<li>An amphibious landing at Barking Sands will be launched from USS Essex (LHD-2), USS Cleveland (LPD-7) and USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 47).
<li>Aegis cruisers like USS Cowpens (CG-63) and USS Antietam (CG-54) will defend against missile attacks while providing a screen for the carriers.
<li>Special Warfare SEAL Teams will conduct a number of missions.
<li>The Coast Guard will operate along the shoreline, keeping harbors open and participating in maritime interdiction operations that involve teaching other units how to properly board a suspicious ship.
<li>The last major exercise for A-6 Intruder aircraft.
</ul>
<h3>The Scenario</h3>
	The scenario for RIMPAC 96 is fabricated and does not portray any existing situation in the world today.  As the exercise unfolds RIMPAC naval forces will have opportunities to practice their capabilities in littoral and crisis situations.<br>
		A Multi-National Force (MNF) is sent to enforce United Nations sanctions. and Bi-Lateral Force (BIF) responds.  This places the two naval forces in opposition. and a series of events occur which results in escalated tensions and specific responses using naval forces.<br>
	Following the exercise, units will return to Pearl Harbor for port visits and exercise debriefs.  They will continue to forge new bonds of camaraderie as Pearl Harbor Naval Station's Morale, Welfare and Recreation Department offers a host of tours and sight-seeing bargains.  MWR is also sponsoring a number of sporting activities to further the growing friendship between ships and nations of the Pacific Rim.<br>
	Officials of this year's exercise hope the 15th RIMPAC is the best yet, but will look for continued support among Pacific Rim nations.
	"The U.S. Pacific Fleet will continue to support these as a catalyst for cooperation between other naval and military forces in the region," Adm Zlatoper said, "promoting understanding, building confidence, and laying the foundation for future cooperative efforts in peacekeeping and response to humanitarian need."<br>

<title>Oahu readies for RIMPAC impact</title>

<h1>RIMPAC 96:</h1>
<h2>Oahu readies for RIMPAC impact</h2>
<h3>By JO1(SW) S. A. Thornbloom</h3>
<hr>
<strong>(Pearl Harbor, Hi, May 22, 1996)</strong>--In years past, RIMPAC has become the perfect marriage of Hawaii's top two industries -- tourism and the military.<br>
When Exercise Rim of the Pacific last sailed into Hawaiian waters two years ago, sailors and their friends and family members dropped about $15 million into the Islands' economic coffers.  With more than 40 ships arriving for RIMPAC 96, that total is expected to jump to $20 million, and Hawaii's tourism industry is waiting with eager anticipation.<br>
"We don't really have any hard numbers yet,'' said Janis Togashi, of the state Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism.  "But we do expect the impact to be equal if not more than it was in 1994."<br>
The military's contribution to Hawaii's economy is second only to tourism.  So with 30,000 service members playing tourist here through the rest of May and most of June, the influx of their dollars should be felt by many.<br>
"The eating and drinking establishments will definitely benefit from RIMPAC,'' said Togashi, "but there's no doubt that other tourist establishments, from hotels to shopping centers, will also benefit."<br>
Hotels, especially in Waikiki, will see a rise in their economic growth over the next month, and so will souvenir shops, restaurants and other businesses, according to a spokesman for Outrigger Hotels, which is Hawaii's largest hotel chain.<br>
"(RIMPAC) will bring more jobs to Waikiki and help fill our restaurants and our gift shops,'' Barry Wallace said.<br>
Moreover, the normally slow months of May and June should see hotel occupancy jump from about 70 percent to 80 percent, he said.<br>
And that, according to Wallace, happens even though many sailors sleep on board their ships at night.<br>
"Curiously some of the U.S. sailors do that," he said. "Maybe they're saving their money or they've been here before.  But most of the foreign crews immediately come to Waikiki."<br>
Even though the visitor base on Oahu takes a big jump, the "neat thing is they're not displacing any current visitors to the Islands,'' Togashi said.  That, too, might be because many sailors sleep aboard ship at night.<br>
Bill Paty, chairman of Military Affairs at the state Commerce Department, calls RIMPAC a major infusion of cash to the economy because sailors rent cars, buy souvenirs and check out the night spots.<br>
"It's one of the biggest things to happen on the Island,'' Paty said.<br>
He compared RIMPAC to Japan's Golden Week, where Japanese workers and their families take a week off each summer to travel and attend festivals.  "You talk about Golden Week, this is our Golden Week."<br>
Paty said Hawaii residents and businesses try to make sure they are extending the Aloha spirit to visiting sailors, rather than reaching out a hand to make money.<br>
"We know they (service members) are doing a heck of a good job and we really appreciate it," said Paty, himself a World War II veteran who parachuted into France on D-Day.  "I hope they all enjoy their stay here, not because they're bringing a paycheck, but because they want to be here."

<center><h1>RIMPAC 96 uses Internet connection</h1>
<hr>
<h5>story by JOC(SW) C.A. McIntire<br>	
Pacific Fleet Public Affairs Office</h5><br></center>
Information on the world's largest naval exercise can now be accessed on the World Wide Web in one of the largest electronic postings dedicated to a single event.<br>
The site contains the latest news on the nearly 100 commands, 44 ships and approximately 60 units participating in Exercise Rim of the Pacific 96, which is being conducted from May 22 through June 21 in and around the Hawaiian Islands.  The site is managed by U.S. Pacific Fleet Public Affairs and the RIMPAC Combined Information Bureau (CIB).<br>
Getting details about the exercise onto the Internet is an important goal for the CIB's leader, Navy Cmdr. Keith Arterburn.<br>
"We wanted to be able to reach as many people as possible with information about RIMPAC 96," he explained.  "The location of the exercise -- in the middle of the Pacific Ocean -- keeps some media from covering this important exercise.  The Internet allows media and interested individuals to follow the exercise."<br>
The website, which can be found through the U.S. Pacific Fleet homepage at www.cpf.navy.mil, contains fact sheets on participating units, Biographies of exercise commanders and information on daily activities.<br>
"We are trying to update it daily with photos and information so that people following the exercise from around the world know what happened that day," Arterburn said.  "Our site provides one-stop shopping for information.  When you see the size of the site and the amount of information we are adding, it gives you an idea of the complexities surrounding the largest naval exercise in the world, RIMPAC 96.<br>
Six Pacific-rim nations -- Australia, Japan, South Korea, Canada, the United States and, for the first time, Chile -- are participating in the biennial exercise.  Although this is the 15th RIMPAC, it is the first for the "information age."<br>
"I believe this is the first time that an Internet site has been used in direct support of a major military exercise," Arterburn said.  "We've checked the Internet carefully and haven't found any record of it being used like this before."<br>
Telling the Navy story directly to anyone with access to the Internet is a daunting challenge for Arterburn and his staff.<br>
"One of the challenges is to gather the basic information on as many of the players as possible," Arterburn said.  "We have active hyperlinks directly to the Canadian, Japanese and Australian websites.  We've tried to use hyperlinks wherever possible, but this technology is so new that we've found ourselves creating much of the material ourselves."
Still, the results made the challenge worth it, Arterburn said.<br>
"Using this cutting-edge technology is exciting because you see information provided to so many more people now," he said.  "It's impressive to see the communications loop come full circle so quickly.<br>
"The event happens, the reporter's story gets published, and then people 'read all about it.'  That used to take days.  Now the reader can access the information in as little as an hour of the event occurring."
The RIMPAC website also makes detailed news about naval operations accessible on a level not available before.<br>
"Sailors sail the seas out of sight of most people, but the RIMPAC 96 Internet site allows anyone to find out what they are doing for the nation today.  Media coverage is limited by space and time, but the Internet lets us tell people what sailors and Marines did today at sea."<br>
The website was accessed 70 times during a 48-hour period, "and we're just getting started," Arterburn said.<br>

<strong>(November 7, 1996)</strong> -- "I come to this job with a great sense of gratitude to Adm. Zlatoper and a great awareness of the legacy which I am inheriting," said Adm. Archie Clemins as he took over command of the Navy's Pacific Fleet from Adm. R. J. Zlatoper.  "This is the job to which Adm. Chester W. Nimitz came during World War II.  Our future will be a time of great challenge, and it will also be a time of bold experimentation, where we must think anew while we continue to make the Navy a place where the best and proud serve, and we accomplish the
mission to the standards of excellence set by Adm. Nimitz." (Official U.S. Navy Photo by JO1 Robert Benson)<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Rear Admiral Chris Oxenbould joined the RAN College in 1962 as a 15 year old entry. Following graduation from the College at Jervis Bay, he received further training in a variety of Fleet Units and the United Kingdom.<br>
In 1972 he commenced Warfare and Navigation sub-specialist training in the United Kingdom, returning the following year to a posting in HMAS TORRENS.

Postings to the United States Naval War College and to Navy Of fice as Director Naval Force Development were followed in May 1989 by command of HMAS PERTH. While in PERTH, the ship completed a major modernisation and following trials and workup deployed to south East Asia. Rear Admiral Oxenbould was promoted to Commodore in October 1990 prior to assuming the appointment as the Commander of the Australian Task Group for Operation DAMASK in the Arabian Gulf, and served in this position throughout the Gulf War. As a result of this service he was made an Officer of the Order of Australia, a member of the Order of King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz (Saudi Arabia) Third Class and was awarded the U.S. Bronze Star medal.<br>
Rear Admiral Oxenbould was posted as the Director General, Naval Policy and Warfare in Navy Office from June 1991 to September 1992.

<h2>USS KITTY HAWK<br>(CV 63)</h2>
An Aircraft Carrier is often desciribed as a floating city. With a crew of more than  5,000 men, USS KITTY HAWK's population is larger than many of thc towns and cities its crew grew up in.<br>
To run K1TTY HAWK requires an infrastructure similar to a city. The duties of the Commanding Of ficer (CO) parallel those of a Mayor. He is ultimately responsible for the welfare of the ship and its crew, and establishes the guldelines under which the ship operates. Next comes the Executive Of ficer (XO), similar in many respects to a City Manager. The XO ensures the CO's guidelines are implemented and the daily functions run smoothly.

<h1>RIMPAC 96<BR>Multi-National<br>Force:<BR><br>USS CUSHING (DD 985)</h1>
<br><br><br>
<title>USS CUSHING (DD 985)</title>
<hr>
<h2>USS CUSHING <br>(DD 985)</h2>
USS CUSHING (DD 985) is the twenty-third SPRUANCE Class Destroyer to be designed and built by Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries in Pascagoula, Mississippi.  Homeported in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, CUSHING is assigned to Naval Surface Group Middle Pacific.<br>
The Spruance Class Destroyer is unique among U.S. warships because it is the first major class to be powered solely by gas turbine engines.  CUSHING is driven by four General Electric LM-2500 gas turbines turning twin controllable reversible pitch propellers.  Designed originally for use on large aircraft, these engines have been modified for marine use and produce approximately 20,000 horsepower each.  They are capable of moving the ship at speeds in excess of 30 knots and provide a degree of maneuverability and flexibility unequaled by any other warship of similar size.<br>
Built with future growth in mind, CUSHING's design is modular in nature, allowing for easy installation of entire subsystems within the ship.  Space and power reservations have been made to accommodate future weapons and electronic systems as they are developed.  This design feature will allow CUSHING to adapt as new military technology evolves.<br>
As a highly versatile multi-mission destroyer, CUSHING is capable of operating independently or in company with amphibious or carrier task forces.  Although equipped to handle a wide variety of tasks, CUSHING's primary mission is Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW).  CUSHING's primary mission is Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW).  CUSHING uses the SQQ-89 sonar system--the most advanced ASW equipment in existence--to accomplish this complex and demanding task.  The ship is equipped with a sophisticated sonar, the AN/SQS-53C, that is directly integrated with a third generation digital computer system, the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS).  In addition to its bow mounted sonar, CUSHING has a passive towed array sonar system.  CUSHING's ASW suite includes two triple barreled torpedo tubes and carries two Light Airborne Multipurpose System (LAMPS) MK III ASW helicopters.  LAMPS is a computer integrated ship/helicopter system, whose primary missions are ASW (to detect, localize and attack subsurface contacts) and Anti-Ship surveillance and targeting (to detect and track surface contacts and provide targeting information for surface-to-surface missiles).  The integrated combat system provides CUSHING with an enhanced target information processing capability and an extremely fast reaction time in response to a wide variety of threats.<br>
CUSHING also boasts the Tomahawk Weapons Control System, the MK 41 Vertical Launching System, two  5 inch/54 caliber fully automatic gun mounts (controlled by the digital Mk 86 Gun Fire Control System), the Harpoon surface-to-surface missile system, and the NATO Sea Sparrow missile system, which provides defense against air targets.  Also integrated with NTDS, those weapon systems allow CUSHING to excel in its other primary mission area of Strike Warfare, Naval Gunfire Support (NGFS), Anti-Surface Warfare (ASUW) and Anti-Air Warfare (AAW).  CUSHING's Close-In Weapons System (CIWS) provides the ship with the most up to date anti-cruise missile defense available.<br>

<h2>RIMPAC 96<BR>Mult-National Force:<BR>USS REID (FFG 30)</h2>
<br><br><br><br>
<title>USS REID (FFG 30)</title>
<hr>
<h2>USS REID<br>(FFG 30)</h2><br>
<img src="ffg30.jpg" alt= "" align=left align=middle height=206 width=400>
<br>USS REID is the eighth Oliver Hazard Perry Class Guided Missile Frigate built for the US Navy by Todd Pacific Shipyards Corporation, Los Angeles, California.  On her commissioning of 19 February 1983, REID joined the Pacific Fleet.<br>
The concept  of the class began in 1971 when the United States Navy initiated a program to build fifty Patrol Frigates.  The class was later redisignated as Guided Missile Frigates and the class leader-USS OLIVER HAZARD PERRY was commissioned on 17 December 19977.  It will be the largest Naval Destroyer class to be built since World War II.<br>
REID'S operational role is to complement the fleet's ability to keep the world's sea lanes open and free and to provide for in-depth protection of military and merchant shipping, underway logistics groups, amphibious forces and aircraft battle groups.  To achieve this the ship has been specifically designed to simultaneously counter threats posed by air, surface and subsurface launched missiles and enemy warships.<br>
In today defense environment, the ability to respond rapidly and effectively is the key to success.  All of REID'S systems are designed to meet this important requirement.  The Combat System is a new and innovative design, integrating a computerized command and decision system with the ship to reduce the number of crew members required.
Designed to provide quick reaction defense against surprise anti-ship missile attack, REID complements the capabilities of other ships of the fleet in ensuring thorough multi-threat protection.<br>
Sensors and Weapons.  Two digital computers provide rapid evaluation of potential threats detected by the radars, the digital sonar, or other shipboard sensors.  Should the need arise, surface-to air and surface-to-surface missiles, a rapid fire gun.  Close In Weapons System, ASW torpedoes, and  an embarked helicopter can be employed effectively in countering potential threats.<br>
Quick reactions are not limited to combat systems alone.  Two computer controlled Gas Turbine Engines operating through a controllable pitch propeller give the ship high acceleration speed and maneuverability and the ability to be "on line" in less than one tenth of the time required by steam turbine ships.  Two forward mounted auxiliary propulsion units give the ship excellent maneuverability in confined harbors and a secondary means of propulsion.<br>
Habitability has been improved over previous designs and labor saving devices and maintenance techniques have been incorporated.<br>

<strong>Aircraft Type:</strong><br>
Northrop Grumman E-2C (Group II) Hawkeye.  Four aircraft are assigned to the squadron.<br>
<a href="vaw117px.htm"><img src="vaw117.gif" alt="VAW-117 E2-C aircraft" align="left" height=320 width=400></a>
The E-2C Hawkeye is a high-wing all weather carrier and shore based airborne early warning and control aircraft.  It is considered to be the most capable airborne early warning aircraft in the world.  The aircraft is powered by two Allison T56-A-427 turbo-prop engines with constant speed Hamilton Standard propellers.<br>
The aircraft's maximum takeoff/launch weight is 55,000 lbs and can recover aboard the aircraft carrier at a maximum weight of 46,500 lbs.  Maximum airspeed at sea level is 345 knots with a landing approach speed of 120 knots.  On a typical mission the aircraft will fly at 25,000 feet and remain on station for 4 hours.  The E-2C is easily identified by its 24 foot diameter rotodome and four vertical tails.<br>
The avionics suite includes a detection system with airborne early warning and IFF radars, passive detection system, a data processing and display system, a communications system including radio data links, and a navigation system.<br>
The E-2C flightcrew will normally consist of a pilot, copilot, combat information center officer, aircraft control officer, and radar officer.<br>   

<strong>Mission Areas</strong><br>
Airborne early warning, command, control and communications.  The aircraft provides early warning of approaching enemy aircraft and vectors fighter aircraft to intercept.  The Hawkeye can also provide strike and traffic control, area surveillance, search and rescue guidance, navigational assistance and communications relay.  The E-2C is "the eyes and ears of the fleet". <br>

<strong>Squadron History</strong><br>
Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN was established at NAS North Island, CA on 1 July 1974, as a unit of Fighter Airborne Early Warning Wing, U.S. Pacific Fleet.  The squadron received its first E-2B aircraft in October 1974, and commenced operational flying.  In May 1976, the squadron moved to it's present home station NAS Miramar, San Diego, CA.  The squadron has deployed with Carrier Air Wing SEVEN aboard the USS INDEPENDENCE (CV-62),  Carrier Air Wing TWO aboard the USS RANGER 
(CV-61), Carrier Air Wing ELEVEN aboard the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65) and USS LINCOLN (CVN-72) and is presently assigned to Carrier Air Wing ELEVEN aboard the USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63).<br>

<strong>Mission</strong><br><a href="vf213pic.htm"><img src="vf213.gif" alt="VF-213 F-14 aircraft" align="right" height=320 width=400></a>
The F-14A Tomcat was built by Grumman Aerospace as a Long Range 
Supersonic Interceptor. Built around the AWG-9 Radar and the AIM-54 Phoenix, the F-14 is capable of detecting and engaging targets in excess of 100 NM. The variable geometry wingsweep design provides the Tomcat with an expanded flight envelope, making it an excellent dogfighting platform. The extended range and large payload capacity of the Tomcat makes it an excellent strike aircraft capable of carrying a variety of Air-to-Ground ordnance, including Laser Guided Munitions.<br>
The F-14 is the only shipboard platform with the ability to carry the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS). The TARPS Pod gives the Tomcat and the Navy the World's premiere Photo-Reconnaissance capability. Because of the versatile design of the airframe and the variety of capable systems available to it, the F-14 will continue to be valuable asset to the Carrier Battle Group well into the 21st century.<br><br>
<strong>History</strong><br>
The Fighting Blacklions of VF-213 were commissioned as a Navy Fighter Squadron on 22 June 1955 at NAS Moffett Field, California. The BLACKLIONS flew the F-2H3 Banshee during their first deployment aboard USS BON HOMME RICHARD (CV-31) then transitioned to the F-4D Skyray for their next two deployments on USS LEXINGTON (CV-16). By their third WESTPAC deployment aboard the "LEX", they were flying the F-3H2 Demon, giving the squadron 
their first capability with the newly released AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile.<br>
In June 1961, the squadron moved to its new home at NAS Miramar - "FIGHTERTOWN USA." Three years later, in February 1964, the BLACKLIONS took a quantum leap forward in fighter capability by accepting the first of their new F-4 Phantoms. In November 1965, VF-213 joined Carrier Air Wing 11 and began the first of six combat deployments to Southeast Asia aboard USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63). This deployment marked the first use of the Phantom as a conventional bomber, a role destined to make the Phantom a mainstay of the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps.<br>
Over the next seven years, the BLACKLIONS flew over 11,500 combat missions and delivered over 6,000 tons of ordnance. On 20 December 1966, LT D.A. McRae and ENS D.N. Nichols downed an enemy AN-2 Colt for the squadron's first kill. In March 1971, VF-213 became the first fleet squadron to fly the Phantom more than 1,000 hours in a single month.<br>
In December 1976, VF-213 transitioned to the Navy's premier supersonic fighter - the F-14A Tomcat. April 1982 found a new mission for the BLACKLIONS when they began training with the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System, or TARPS. In September of that year, the squadron began their first deployment aboard USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65). During Indian Ocean Operations, the BLACKLIONS again set the standard by flying the longest tasked carrier flight for a Tomcat when they completed a 1,775 mile TARPS flight.<br>
During WESTPAC  88, the BLACKLIONS took an active role in ensuring the safe transit of reflagged tankers through the Persian Gulf and the Straights of Hormuz. That same deployment saw VF-213 in action in the Operation Praying Mantis naval conflict with Iran on 18 April 1988.<br>
The BLACKLIONS were awarded the prestigious "BOOLA BOOLA" award in March 1989 for their aggressive professional completion of all missile test firings that year. That fall, VF-213 and CVW-11 went around-the-world on ENTERPRISE's final west coast deployment, dropping her off in Norfolk, Virginia for refurbishment.<br>
In September 1990, VF-213 and CVW-11 went back to the shipyards of Norfolk, VA to embark on the Navy's newest nuclear powered aircraft carrier: USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN (CVN-72). After a successful transit around the horn of South America, ABE took up residence at her new home in Alameda, California.
In 1991, the BLACKLIONS deployed on USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN's maiden cruise to the WESTPAC in support of Operation Desert Storm. Day and night Combat Air Patrol flights over Kuwait enforced the United Nation's sanctions on Iraq, while TARPS missions recorded the devastation of Kuwait oil fields.<br>
The BLACKLIONS shone brightly in 1992. VF-213 won the coveted "MUTHA" award and took honors as the Pacific Fleet's top fleet squadron when they won the 1992 Fighter Derby. The squadron deployed for the second time aboard USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN in 1993, participating in Operation Southern Watch over Iraq and Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. Upon their return to "FIGHTERTOWN", VF-213 began a turnaround for their next deployment during which they again won the "MUTHA" award; the final "MUTHA" trophy awarded. From April to October 1995, the BLACKLIONS again deployed aboard LINCOLN in support of Operation Southern Watch. The squadron once again made history by having all fourteen Tomcats airborne at once over the skies of Iraq and Kuwait.<br>
VF-213 is currently in the middle of an eleven month compressed turnaround schedule. In October of this year, the squadron will cross-deck back to the USS KITTY HAWK for another WESTPAC deployment. The  BLACKLIONS of VF-213 continue to maintain their commitment to excellence as they have throughout their forty year history.<br>

<strong>Mission</strong><br>
The F/A-18 was the first aircraft designed from the ground up to
be a true dual mission aircraft.  This gives the pilot the
 ability to instantly switch from the ground attack role to the air to air role with the push of a button.  Strike planners now have the ability to put more precision bombs on target with less or no dedicated fighter support required.  The "Night Vision Goggle" equipped Lot 12 hornets are capable of all weather intercept, identify and destroy missions as well as day and night ground attack missions.<br><br><a href="vfa22pic.htm"><img src="vfa22.gif" alt="VFA-22 F/A-18 aircraft" align="left" height=320 width=400></a>
<strong>Command History</strong><br>
The "Fighting Redcocks" of Strike Fighter Squadron 22 have been a critical part of Naval Aviation for almost 50 years.  Originally commissioned as Fighter Squadron 63 at NAS Norfolk, Virginia in 1948, the squadron's official designation was changed to Attack Squadron 22 in July 1959.  Today, the 194 enlisted men and women and 24 officers of Strike Fighter Squadron 22 are based in Lemoore, California and maintain and fly the FA-18C Night Attack "Hornet".<br>
The first Redcock aviators flew the F-8F "Bearcat" and succeeding pilots have progressed through the F-4U "Corsair", F-9F "Panther", F-9F-6/8 "Cougar", FJ-4B "Fury", A-4 B/C/F "Skyhawk", and the A-7E "Corsair II" before transitioning to the FA-18C "Hornet".<br>
The "Fighting Redcocks" have been called into action repeatedly over the years including three combat deployments during the Korean War and six combat deployments during the Vietnam War.  On the final Vietnam deployment, VA-22 participated in the critical mining of Haiphong Harbor and intensive air strikes into North Vietnam helping to force renewed peace negotiations.<br>
The "Fighting Redcocks" received the COMNAVAIRPAC Battle Efficiency "E" for three consecutive years during the period from 1979 through 1981, an unprecedented accomplishment. Additionally, the command was awarded the 1981 CINCPACFLT Golden Anchor retention award among all deployable squadrons in the Pacific Fleet and the COMLATWINGPAC John L. Nicholson retention award for both 1980 and 1981.  The squadron also received the
RADM Clarence Wade McClusky Award during 1981 as the best Attack Squadron in the United States Navy.  Also during this period from 1979-1981, the "Fighting Redcocks" were awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for unmatched fulfillment of the Navy wide goals of combat readiness and personal retention while deployed with Carrier Air Wing 15 and shorebased in Lemoore, California.<br>
In January 1982, VFA-22's Operational Commander was changed to Carrier Air Wing 11 which deployed aboard the USS KITTY HAWK (CV 63).  In 1983, the command received the COMNAVAIRPAC nomination for the RADM Clarence Wade McClusky Award and was presented with the prestigious LTJG Bruce Carrier Award for excellence in Aviation Maintenance.<br>
The squadron made operational history in December 1985 by being the first west coast squadron to successfully launch an AGM-88 HARM (High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile) resulting in a direct hit.  This was the first firing of a HARM missile built up in a ship's magazine.<br>
The "Fighting Redcocks" 1986 deployment took the squadron around the world by transiting the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea in response to Libyan actions.  The command was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation for operations including those off the coast of Libya.  Additionally in 1986, the command once again won the LTJG Bruce Carrier award as a result of their exceptional maintenance department.<br>
Upon return to the United States, the squadron developed and produced the 1987 "Great Western Shootout" which involved United States Navy, United States Air Force and National Guard and German Luftwaffe pilots participating in a joint services power projection exercise against state-of-the-art adversary threats. Led by "Fighting Redcock" pilots and jets, the exercise provided invaluable joint training for all involved.  Shortly after the "Great Western Shootout", the squadron deployed to Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada to operate with the United States Air Force during a "Red Flag" exercise, the first squadron from LATWINGPAC to participate in "Red Flag" in over seven years.<br>
The "Fighting Redcocks" were again chosen as the recipient of the COMNAVAIRPAC Battle Efficiency "E" in 1987.<br>
In 1988, the squadron was deployed aboard the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65) and found themselves participating in the escort of tankers through the Arabian Gulf during the Ernest Will Operation.  On April 18, 1988, VA-22 jets were involved in disabling the Iranian Frigate SAHAND with precision guided weapons and free fall bombs in what was termed a "measured response" to Iranian actions in the Arabian Gulf.<br>
In 1990, after an around the world cruise on the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN 65), the "Fighting Redcocks" retired their A-7E aircraft ending over 20 years of service with the "Corsair II". Redesignated Strike Fighter Squadron 22 in May 1990, the command transitioned to the FA-18C Night Attack Hornet.<br>  Operational requirements dictated an accelerated transition and the "Fighting Redcocks" became completely combat qualified in the new aircraft in record time and recorded the highest scores awarded by COMSTRKFIGHTWINGPAC on all squadron turnaround inspections.<br>
Deploying in 1991 aboard the USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN (CVN 72), VFA-22 participated in Operation Fiery Vigil, providing assistance in evacuating US Servicemen and their dependents from the Philippines after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo.  Following this event, the squadron continued to the Arabian Gulf participating in operations during the withdrawal of forces from Desert Storm. The "Fighting Redcocks" were again presented with the 1991 COMNAVAIRPAC Battle Efficiency "E" award for command excellence.<br>
In 1993, the "Fighting Redcocks" again deployed aboard the USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN (CVN 72) to the Arabian Gulf and participated in Operation Southern Watch enforcing the United Nations southern no fly zone over Iraq.  Before returning home, the squadron diverted to the coast of Somalia providing air support during Operation Continue Hope.  VFA-22 was the first squadron to deploy with the advanced FA-18 91C software in their aircraft and the first to operate with the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile on this cruise.  The year was highlighted by the squadron's receipt of the COMCARGRU 3 and CVW-11 nomination for the 1993 COMNAVAIRPAC Battle Efficiency, RADM Clarence Wade McClusky and Estocin awards for excellence.<br>
The "Fighting Redcocks" were among the first west coast squadrons to integrate women into combat units and participated in several "Air Warrior" exercises with United States Air Force and United States Army units during the turnaround cycle.  After a six monthly deployment to the Western Pacific in 1995, the integration is a proven success.<br>
Today, after a very short turnaround cycle, the men and women of VFA-22 are deployed aboard the USS KITTY HAWK (CV 63) in preparation for another Western Pacific deployment in October.<br>

Strike Fighter Squadron 94 is one of nine squadrons in Carrier Air Wing 11 currently participating in RIMPAC  96 aboard the USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63).  July through September will be spent working up for a six month deployment to the Persian Gulf in October. <br>
VFA-94, along with the two other Hornet squadrons, are the battle group's primary power projection force. With the aid of the FLIR (forward looking infrared) and NVG's(night vision goggles), the Hornet can deliver precision guided ordinance all weather, day or night. This capability reduces the number of aircraft and ordinance needed to fulfill a mission which increases the striking power of the carrier. <br>

<strong>Aircraft Type & Mission</strong><br>
The squadron flies the F/A-18A "Hornet", a Multi-role Strike Fighter built by MACAIR. The aircraft consists of two turbofan afterburner engines capable of over 16,000 lbs of thrust. In the Air-to-Air arena, the Hornet can carry multiple AIM-9 "Sidewinders" and the AIM-7 "Sparrow" missiles. Air-to-Ground, the Warhawks can deliver over 3 tons of ordnance, both "dumb bombs" and "smart weapons".<br><br>
<strong>Squadron History</strong><br>
The Warhawks were commissioned as Attack Squadron 97 in June 1967 and after a brief period flying the A-7B Corsair became the second Navy squadron to transition to the A-7E Corsair II.  A year later, VA-97 was "feet dry" over enemy territory as it flew numerous strike missions against North Vietnam from the "steel decks" of the USS CONSTELLATION (CV-64). The majority of these strikes were flown to interrupt the steady stream of war materials headed southward.<br><a href="vfa97pic.htm"><img src="vfa97.gif" alt="VFA-97 F/A-18 aircraft" align="left" height=320 width=400></a>
In 1969, the Warhawks were once again off the coast of Vietnam carrying the war to the enemies front step.  During this time VA-97 pioneered the use of some of the new "smart" weapons such as the television guided Walleye bomb and Shrike anti-radiation missiles. That year the squadron also received the COMNAVAIRPAC Battle "E" award for efficiency in combat training and operations.<br>
From 1973 to 1975 the Warhawks were aboard the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65) conducting flight operations in South China Sea to protect American evacuees and Vietnamese refugees attempting to leave South Vietnam.  Two years later, in 1977,  the Warhawks won the "Triple Crown" of Naval Aviation by receiving the Admiral C. Wade McClusky Award, the CNO Aviation Safety Award and the COMNAVAIRPAC Battle "E" during the same competitive cycle.  This seldom seen feat was the result of hard work by all hands within the squadron.<br>
During the period 1979 to 1983, VA-97 was attached to Carrier Air Wing 14 on board USS CORAL SEA (CV-43).  Most of the 1979 WESTPAC cruise was spent on Camel Station in the Gulf of Oman, in direct support of our Government's efforts to extract  the U.S. embassy hostages held in Iran.
In 1984, the Warhawks became an invaluable asset to Carrier Air Wing 15, deploying aboard USS CARL VINSON (CV-70).  From 1984 to 1988, the Warhawks made three deployments to the Persian Gulf arena and twice participated in operation "Earnest Will", which consisted of escorting U.S. Flagged Tankers through the Gulf.  In 1989, the Warhawks were once again recognized as the finest Light Attack Squadron in the Pacific, winning the COMNAVAIRPAC Battle "E".<br>
1990 was another busy year for the Team Warhawk as they completed their 15th WESTPAC and transitioned to F/A-18A Hornet.  The Warhawks were the last west coast fleet squadron to fly the venerable and battle tested A-7E Corsair II.  The official end to the Corsair era came on 24 January 1991, when Attack Squadron 97 was redesignated Strike Fighter Squadron 97.<br>
During the period 1991-1993 the squadron was aboard USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63) and joined CAG-15 as the carrier was brought "Around the Horn" of South America to it's present home port, San Diego, California. The squadron's 16th deployment began in November 1992. During this eventful WESTPAC, the squadron participated in Operation Restore Hope in Somalia and flew actual combat sorties during Operation Southern Watch in Iraq.<br>
Strike Fighter Squadron Nine Seven was one of the few squadrons not to be decommissioned when CAG-15 was disestablished in March of 1995.

The S-3B Viking is a four seat,  high-wing,  jet-powered,  twin-engine,  carrier based aircraft with direct attack capability designed to provide Battle Group support in the following mission areas:
<ul>
<li>Undersea Warfare (USW)
<li>Surface Warfare (SUW)
<li>Strike Support
<li>Air Refueling.
</ul>
<a href="vs29pic.htm"><img src="vs29.gif" alt="VS-29 S-3 aircraft" align="left" height=320 width=400></a>
The Viking carries a variety of surface and subsurface search equipment with integrated target acquisition and sensor coordinating systems that can collect, process, interpret,  and store USW and  SUW  data.<br>
<strong>Command History</strong><br>
Commissioned 1 April 1960 the VS-29 Dragonfires have protected the fleet in all major oceans of the globe with aggressive and imaginative tactical employment of the S-2 Tracker and the S-3A/B Viking.  The squadron flew the S-2 Tracker from 1961 until 1975 when it transitioned to the S-3A.  The S-3A was flown until 1992, at which time the Dragonfires transitioned to the S-3B.  <br>
Highlights of  VS-29's history include assisting in the recovery of the Mercury space capsules in 1962 and 1963 and operations in the South China Sea in 1964 after the Gulf of Tonkin Incident with North Vietnam. VS-29 made several deployments to the Gulf of Tonkin throughout the Vietnam conflict.  Furthermore,  after transitioning to the S-3A the Dragonfires achieved a Naval Aviation first by flying a 1700 mile carrier-launched overwater flight from the USS Enterprise in the Indian Ocean to the island of Diego Garcia. In 1982, While embarked on the USS Carl Vinson, VS-29 earned the distinction of being the first Viking squadron to make an "Around the World Cruise". <br> 
More recently,  while embarked on the USS Abraham Lincoln,  the VS-29 Dragonfires have participated in Operation Fiery Vigil (the evacuation of the Subic Naval Base after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines),  Operation Southern Watch in support of the United Nations' sanctions against Iraq,  and Operation restore hope in support of the United Nations' humanitarian mission in Somalia.<br>

<strong>Aircraft Type</strong><br>
Lockheed ES-3A utilizing advance avionics systems.  Carries a crew of four-Pilot, Electronic Warfare Combat Coordinator (EWCC), and two Electronic Reconnaissance Operators. <br>

<strong>Mission</strong><br>
To provide tactical reconnaissance capability to an operational commander.  Mission can be performed whether operating from an aircraft carrier or from remote land bases.  Specific missions might include Indications and Warnings (I&W), Command and Communications (C3), Over-the-horizon Targeting (OTH-T), and passive Electronic Warfare (EW) in support of the full range of naval operations.<br>
<a href="vq5pic.htm"><img src="vq5.gif" alt="VQ-5 ES-3A aircraft" align="right" height=320 width=400></a>
<strong>Brief synopsis of the squadron</strong><br>
Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron FIVE was officially established on 15 April 1991 operating from NAS Agana Guam.  VQ-5 was created 
to provide battle group commanders with a replacement for the EA-3.  The squadron had received its total complement of eight ES-3A's by June 1994.  Flying from landbased detachment sites, the squadron supported several major exercises, including Annualex 92, Encouterex, and Team Spirit 93.
The Navy's first operational cruise for the ES-3A began in November 1993 when DET ALFA deployed aboard the USS INDEPENDENCE (CV-62) in support of Operation Southern Watch in the Persian Gulf.  Subsequent detachments have deployed aboard the USS CARL VINSON (CVN-70), USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63), USS CONSTELLATION (CV 64), and the USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN (CVN-72) in the Western Pacific and the Persian Gulf, supporting Operations Southern Watch, Tandem Thrust 94 and Korean contingency operations.<br>
From stand up in 1991 to full operational status by 1993, VQ-5 compiled an envious record of accomplishments, earning the COMFAIRWESTPAC nomination for the Safety "S" and ultimately winning their first COMNAVAIRPAC Battle "E".  In July 1994, VQ-5 changed homeport from NAS Agana Guam to NAS North Island San Diego and was officially established as a resident command on 01 October 1994.  Today, VQ-5 is at full operational strength and has flown over 7800 hours accident free since its establishment. In 1994, the squadron flew over 3900 hours, a five fold increase over optempo during the first year of operations.<br>

Carrier Air Wing FIVE - VRC-30

<h2> Fleet Logistics Support Squadron THREE ZERO</h2><br>
<br></center>

<P> 
    The primary mission of the Fleet Logistics Support Squadron THREE ZERO (VRC-30) Det 5 "PROVIDERS" is to provide the transport of high-priority cargo, mail and passengers between aircraft carriers at sea and shore bases throughout the Pacific Theater.  In addition, Det 5 is capable of providing airdrop/paradrop support for Special warfare Units of any branch of service.  Det 5 flies three C-2A greyhounds, better known as the C.O.D. (Carrier Onboard Delivery), emblazoned with the "NF" markings of the Operational Commander, Carrier Air Wing FIVE (CVW-5). <br><br>

    The C-2A is a twin engine aircraft manufactured by Grumman.  Maximum payload capacity is 10,000 pounds with the ability to carry 26 passengers.  Det 5 supports USS INDEPENDENCE (CV 62), and Commander Fleet Air Western Pacific (COMFAIRWESTPAC). <br><br>

Fleet Logistics Support Squadron THREE ZERO (VRC-30) of San Diego, CA, recently expanded it's Theater of Operations to include the Kanto Plains of Japan.  The disestablishment of the VRC-50 "FOO-DOGS" on September 29, 1994 at Andersen AFB, Guam led to the establishment of the VRC-30 Det 5 "PROVIDERS" on August 7, 1994, at NAF Atsugi.  VRC-30 Det 5 is the first and only permanently forward deployed carrier logistics detachment in the Navy. <br><br>

    Detachment 5 currently consists of seven officers and thirty-four enlisted troops, with the final manning requirements arriving by July 1995.  Arriving on August 7, 1994, temporary personnel from San Diego were initially assigned to Det 5 to provide services to the USS INDEPENDENCE during its final at sea period before dry dock, carrying a total of 84 passengers and 20,000 pounds of cargo.  The permanent personnel who have since replaced the temporary personnel are ordered to Japan for two to three years.  The first was AE2 Houston Johnson who arrived on July 8, 1994, and was assigned temporarily to AIMD, awaiting the detachment arrival.  AE2 Johnson was command advanced on November 16, 1994, to AE1 by CDR J.D. Fowler, Commanding Officer of VRC-30, on a visit to Japan. <br><br>

    The stand up process culminated in a "Change of Charge" ceremony.  LCDR J.A. Hubbard relieved CDR L.C. Shaffer-Vanaria on December 1, 1994 as Officer in Charge of VRC-30 Det 5.  On that day the first Det 5 C-2A Greyhound aircraft was flown by LT M.D. Laslo, LT J.K. Mitchell, and ADC R.J. Holsworth.  The detachment has three aircraft assigned with side numbers 430, 431, and 432. <br><br>

    Det 5 has devoted many hours, working extremely long days, weekends, and holidays in an attempt to stand up the det and keep the aircraft flying.  Prior to operations in December, the detachment underwent a Material Condition Inspection (MCI)/ Maintenance Programs Assist (MPA) on November 14, 1994 to determine if the PROVIDERS were safe for flight.  The results of the MCI were in the det's favor, safe for flight.  The results of the MPA were outstanding.

<title>USS ESSEX (LHD 2)</title>
<hr>
<h1>USS ESSEX<br>(LHD 2)</h1>
USS ESSEX (LHD 2) is safe, trained and ready to fight.<br>
ESSEX'S mission is to conduct prompt, sustained combat operations at sea, as the centerpiece of the Navy's amphibious strategy of Forward...From the Sea.  ESSEX provides the means to deliver, command and support all elements of a Marine Landing Force in an assault by air and amphibious craft.<br>
In carrying out her mission, ESSEX has the option of utilizing various combinations of helicopters, Harrier II(AV-8B) Jump Jets and air cushion landing craft(LCAC), as well as conventional landing craft and assault vehicles, illustrating the LHD's flexibility.  ESSEX can also provide command and control and aircraft facilities for sea control missions, while operating with an aircraft carrier battle group.<br>
ESSEX will transport and land ashore  not only troops, but also the tanks, trucks, jeeps, other vehicles, artillery, ammunition and various supplies necessary to support the amphibious assault mission.  Monorails trains, moving at speeds up to 600 feet per minute, transport cargo and supplies from storage and staging areas throughout the ship to a 13,600 square foot well deck which opens to the sea through huge gates in the ship's stern.  There, the cargo, troops and vehicles are loaded aboard landing craft for transit to the beach.  Air cushion landing craft can "fly" out of the dry well deck; or the well deck can be ballasted down for conventional craft to float out on their way to the assault area.  Helicopter flights also transfer troops and equipment to the beach, while the ship's air traffic control capability simultaneously directs close air tactical support provided by embarked jet aircraft and helicopter gunships.<br>
The ship's extensive medical facilities consist of six medical operating rooms, four dental operating rooms, medical laboratories and hospital facilities capable of caring for 600 patients.  ESSEX is second only to the Navy's hospital ships in medical support capability, providing effective care to returning troops under battle conditions, or disaster relief in support of humanitarian missions during peacetime.<br>

<hr>
<a href="ssn716.jpg"><img src="ssn716.gif" alt= "USS SALT LAKE CITY" align=right height=312 width=250></a>
USS SALT LAKE CITY (SSN 716) is the Navy's 27th Los Angeles Class Fast Attack Submarine.  The ship is a streamlined, highly advanced and maneuverable multi-mission platform which employs the best the industry can offer in three major areas.<br>
First, she is powered by a pressurized water nuclear reactor of advanced design.  The safe, reliable, and extremely powerful reactor plant gives SALT LAKE CITY the ability to operate independently of the outside atmosphere for extended periods at high speed.<br><img src="subpac.gif" alt="SUBPAC Logo" align="left" height=215 width=195>
Second, the state of the art combat systems and electronic suites installed on board SALT LAKE CITY provide the nervous system that allows her to perform her assigned tasks.  Computers are the backbone of the ship's sonar, electronic surveillance measures, fire control, and navigation systems; the systems that give SALT LAKE CITY her formidable capability.<br>
Finally, SALT LAKE CITY is capable of carrying the most advanced weapons available to the submarine force, including the TOMAHAWK long range cruise missile, the HARPOON anti-surface ship cruise missile, the MK-48 long range anti-submarine and anti-surface torpedo and a variety of mines.

<h2><br>USS KAMEHAMEHA (SSN-642)</h2>
USS KAMEHAMEHA is named after Kamehameha the Great, the
warrior and statesman who first united the Hawaiian Island under a single
rule.<br>
Kamehameha was born into nobility on the island of Hawaii in 1758
He spent his youth learning the arts of war and leadership.<br>
After seizing control of most of the island of Hawaii from his cous-
ins, he started on a campaign for the conquest of all the Hawaiian Islands.   His conquest of Oahu in 1795 was followed by the peaceful capitulation of Kauai and Mihau and final unification of the islands.<br>
<img src="subpac.gif" alt="SUBPAC Logo" align="left" height=215 width=200>Kamehameha then sought to develop a stable government. He established strict laws of conduct and was responsible for making the islands safe for all citizens. His policy toward foreigners, an increasingly important factor in the social and economic life of the islands, was one of protection, encouragement of trade and fair dealing. By the time of his death he had consolidated the islands under one government and put an end to the feudal wars and anarchy that had ravaged the islands before his rule.<br>
The submarine KAMEHAMEHA serves today to make the world a
safe place to live just as Kamehameha did as ruler of the Hawaiian Islands.<br>

<h2>HMAS NEWCASTLE<br>(FFG 06)</h2>
HMAS NEWCASTLE is Guided Missile Frigate, a long-range escort with roles including area air defence, anti-submarine warfare, surveillance, reconnaissance and interdiction. The ship is capable of countering simultaneous threats from the air, surface and sub-surface.<br>
NEWCASTLE and her five sisters are the first RAN ships to be powered by gas turbines for the main propulsion. This, combined with a modern repair-by-replacement policy, has allowed both a reduced complement and a high availability for sea. NEWCASTLE can be underway from cold in less than 30 minutes, in addition, two forward mounted retractable auxiliary propulsion units provide a secondary means of propulsion plus excellent
manoeuvrability in confined waters.<br>
NEWCASTLE's principal weapons are the Standard medium range anti-aircraft missile and the Harpoon anti-ship missile, both of which are launched from Mk t 3 launcher on the forecastle. A 76 mm gun to counter both anti-aircraft and anti-surface threats is fitted forward of the funnel and one 20 mm Phalanx Close-in-Weapons System for anti-missile defence is located above the helicopter hangar.  For long range anti-submarine tasks,
NEWCASTLE is equipped with flight deck and hangars for two S-70B-2 Seahawk helicopters.  For close-in anti-submarine defence the ship is fitted with two Mk 32 triple torpedo tubes.<br>
The ship's sensor package includes long range radars for air and surface surveillance, electronic warfare surveillance sensors and is the second FFG to be fitted with the Australian designed and built Mulloka medium range sonar for the detection of submarines.<br>
A computer based command and control system processes information as well as target data received by data link from other ships and aircraft.
NEWCASTLE is the first RAN ship to bear the name although there have been eight British NEWCASTLEs. The latest, a destroyer, is still serving.<br>

<h2>HMAS SYDNEY<br>(FFG 03)</h2>
Commissioned on 29 January 1983, HMAS SYDNEY is one of six guided missile
frigates in service with the Royal Australian Navy. Powered by two gas turbine engines, the ship is capable of speeds up to 30 knots.  SYDNEY is a long range escort with the ability to provide area air defence, anti-sub-marine warfare, surveillance, reconnaissance and interdiction. She can counter simultaneous threats from the air, surface and sub-surface environments. The ship's principal weapons are Standard anti-air missiles and
Harpoon anti-ship missiles, both of which are launched from a Mk 13 launcher on the forecastle. A 76 mm rapid fire gun to counter both air and surface threats is fitted forward of the funnel and one 20 mm Phalanx close-in weapon system (CIWS) for anti-missile defence is fitted above the helicopter hangar. Two Mk 32 triple torpedo tubes are fitted to the ship for close-in anti-submarine defence. Long range radars and the 5-70B-2 Seahawk helicopter are the primary means by which targets are located
and classified.	The ship has a normal complement of 212 personnel, of whom 36 are female. SYDNEY has deployed to the Middle East three times during her career. On the first occasion she took part in Operation Desert Storm, the action against Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War, for which she earned a Meritorious Unit Citation. The second and third times were to the northern Red Sea in support of United Nations sanctions against Iraq during 1991/92 and from June to December 1993.<br>
The name SYDNEY has been carried by three former RAN warships; a light cruiser which served from 1913 to 1928; a second light cruiser from 1935 to her loss in 1941 and an aircraft carrier/fast troop transport, from 1948 to 1973.<br>

<h3>Submarines In The Chilean Navy
</h3>
Submarine activities in Chile go as far back as 1886 when Mr. C. Flachs designed and built a Submarine which he intended to sell to the Chilean Navy.  His boat turned out to be a cigar shaped tube 13 meters long, had a crew of six and carried a small cannon for surface actions and a "Submarine Cannon" of which no details are available.  The boat was successfully tried, but unfortunately when the official demonstration was presented to the President  of the Republic who in fact was invited to participate in the trials but very wisely refused the boat submerged amid the cheers of the crowds but never again surfaced.<br>
The second adventure recorder, is the submarine designed by Mr. J. Huber, prefabricated in Santiago assembled in Talcahuano in 1896.  It had a displacement of  15.5 tons, was 8 meter's in length and had a crew of five.  It was propelled by an 8 H.P. electric motor and its batteries had endurance of ten hors.  
This boat was successful on trails but did not attract the attention of the Naval authorities of the time.<br>
The first submarines built for the Navy were the "IQUIQUE" and the "ANTOFAGASTA" in 1913 in the U. S. A. but these were diverted to Canada when the first world war broke out.  Due to the fact that the Royal Navy took two Battleship and number of Destroyers being built for two Battleship and number of Destroyer being built for Chile in U. K. yards between 1912 and 1914, the R. N. ceded five "H" Class Submarines being built at the Electric Boat Company in America.  Chile purchased on more and on the 4th of July 1917 the six submarines were commissioned with the names of famous Araucanian women; Quidora, Tegualda, Fresia, Guale, Rucmilla Guadcolda.  These were magnificent boats and served for thirty eight years in the Navy.<br>
In 1928 three "O" Class boats were built by Vickers-Armstrong Ltd., for Chile and commissioned in 1929, they were the "O'BRIEN", "THOMSON", and "SIMPSON".  These submarines were scrapped in 1957 after twenty eight years of very good service.<br>
The U.S. Navy in 1962 turned over to the Chilean Navy the USS SPOT and USS SPRINGER and they served with the names of "SIMPSON" and "THOMSON".<br>
"O'BRIEN" and "HYATT" ordered in 1970, will fulfill the requirement of replenishing and modernizing the submarine branch of the Chilean Navy.<br>
Moreover the Oberon class, the Chilean Navy has two U-209 Submarine class which were commissioned between the months of September and December of 1984.<br>
The crew for Chilean Submarines was trained, between 1917 and 1982, at the Submarine School in Valparafso.<br>
At the present, the Submarine School is on the Naval Base of Talcahuano.<br>

<h3>Generaciones De "Simpson"</h3>

Durante el periodo entre ambas guerras mundiales, la importancia del submarino como arma ofensiva va en aumento, es asi como en 1980 solo un pais contaba con ellos y a fines de 1939 eran 266 los que los poseian, entre ellos Chile.<br>
Desde comienzos de siglo, el alto mando de la Armada se intereso en la significativa contribucion que el submarina podia aportar al Poder Naval.<br>
La Posibilidad de contar con submarinos oceanicos que incrementaran la potencialidad de la fuerza operativa de la epoca, se tranformo en una realdad con el desarrollo que habian alcanzado los submarinos despues de finalizada la Primera Guerra Mundial.<br>
A principios de 1928, se imparten las ordenes para adquirir tres submarinos de 1520 toneladas y son designadas las dotaciones que se componian de 5 oficiales y 47 hombres por submarino.<br>
La construccion se llevo a efecto en los Astillros de la firma Vickers Armstrong Ltda., en la ciudad de Barrow-In-Furness en Inglaterra.<br>
Fueron unidades modernas para su epoca y estaban dotadas con todos los adelantos conocidos hasta ese momento.  Tenian un andar maximo en superficie de 15 nudos.  Sumergidos lograban alcanzar 8 nudos por una hora, contando para ello con dos motores electricos de propulsion.  Para atacar, tenian 6 tubos lanzatorpedos a proa y 2 a popa, ademas de un canon de 120 m/m. para acciones en superficie.<br>
Los sumergibles fueron bautizados con nombres que recuerdan a los ilustres heroes de nuestra Armada; Almirante don Roberto SIMPSON Simpson y los Capitanes de Fragata Don Manual THOMSON Porto y don Jorge O'BRIEN.<br>
El 16 de Diciembre de 1929 izo su insignia de Comorodo de Flotilla el Capitan de Navio (SM.)  Don Julio ALLARD Pinto en uno de los submarinos y el 27 de ese mismo mes zarpo con las tres unidades hacia Chile, recalando el 15 de Marzo en Quintero, donde fue revistada la fllotilla por el Presidente de la Republica, General don Carlos IBANEZ Del Campo.<br>
El buque madre de submarinos "ARAUCANO", recalo al pais en 1930, pocos meses despues de la llegada de los submarinos tipo "O".  La dotacion del BMS., era de 350 tripulantes incluyendo 22 Oficiales.<br>
Como apoyo a los submarinos en repqraciones o en reserva, existio, en lo que se llamaba "Arsenales de Talcahuano", una Base de Submarinos que funciono con el nombre de "Subdepartamento de Submarinos"<br>
Para desempenar su importante funcion contaba con;molo de atraque, una  maestranza de combustion interna con fundicion y taller de niquelado un hospital de baterias para almacenarias y mantenerlas, una planta destiladora, un panol de requestos y varios de consumos, un casino de Oficiales,  un cuartel para personal una denstistica,, una cancha de tenis y otra de futbol y Oficinas para la Comandancia, Segunda Comandancia, Secretaria, contadura y Sala de Conferencias.<br>
Esta infraestructure fue disuelta a principios de la decada del 60, siendo distrubuidos sus medios y recursos en el antiguo Arsenal, actual planta industrial de ASMART Talcahuano.<br>

<img src="mccainar.gif" alt="Senator McCain Arriving at the Ceremony" align="left" height=278 width=400>
<strong>(November 7, 1996)</strong> -- "As Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Adm. Zlatoper made tough decisions about long ship deployments from homeports and loved ones, but most importantly, in his 
determination to improve the quality of life of Navy personnel, he gave a much louder voice to the Sailors in Navy decisions about issues affecting their well-being," said Senator John McCain about long-time friend and colleague Admiral R. J. Zlatoper at the CINCPACFLT change of command ceremony.  "The men and women he commanded responded to his superb leadership by performing superbly themselves in places like the Taiwan Straits, the Korean Peninsula and the skies over Iraq."  Admiral Archie Clemins relieved Zlatoper as the Pacific Fleet Commander in Chief. (Official U.S. Navy Photo by JO1 Robert Benson)<br><br>

<h2>Carrier Air Wing FIVE</h2><br>
 <br></center>
</b>
<p>
Carrier Air Wing FIVE (CVW-5) has a long and rich heritage in Naval Aviation.  Originally commissioned as Carrier Air Group FIVE (CVG-5) in 1943, the new air group rapidly became embroiled in the war in the Pacific.  Homeported in San Diego, California, after the war, Air Group FIVE quickly recorded a number of firsts, including the first squadron to land a jet aircraft aboard a carrier (1948). </p>

<p>CVG-5 was the first air group to enter the Korean War, and after serving 18 months in the combat zone, had compiled more combat time than any other air group in the Korean War.  CVG-5 was renamed CVW-5 in 1963 when the Navy reclassified its air groups.  In 1964, CVW-5 was called to action in the Gulf of Tonkin for a total of eight combat cruises.  In 1973, CVW-5 embarked on USS MIDWAY (CVA-41) to become part of the first carrier/air wing team permanently forward deployed overseas. CVW-5 completed 111 continuous day on station in the North Arabian Sea in 1984, guarding the Straits of Hormuz and guaranteeing th continued flow of vital oil to Japan and Western Europe. </p>

<p>CVW-5 began its final cruise aboard MIDWAY in October 1990 as part of Operation DESERT SHIELD.  From November to January 1991, the air wing participated in numerous multinational exercises and operated continuously in the Arabian Gulf.  On January 17, 1991, Operation Desert Storm began as CVW-5 aircraft launched a night strike deep into Iraq.  For the next 43 days the air wing flew 3,383 combat sorties and expended more than four million pounds of ordnance.  CVW-5 and Midway contributed significantly to the liberation of Kuwait and the minimization of allied casualties. </p>

<p>In August 1991, CVW-5 transitioned to USS INDEPENDENCE (CV 62).  The air wing now consists of eight squadrons and two detachments<A HREF="vf154.htm"><B>VF-154</B></A>,

VFA-27 will replace VA-115 in CVW-5 in the Fall of '96. </p> 

<p>As a permanent element of SEVENTH Fleet and operating from the Northern Pacific to the Arabian Gulf, the USS INDEPENDENCE/CVW-5 team represent a credible deterrent to aggression.

Carrier Air Wing FIVE - HS-14

<img src="hs14lg.jpg"></a><img src="helo.jpg"></a><br>
<h2> Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron FOURTEEN<br><br>
"CHARGERS" <br>
COMMAND HISTORY
 </h2><br></center>
</b>
<P>


	HS-14 was established on 10 July 1984 at Naval Air Station, North Island, San Diego California, under the administrative control of Commander, Anti-Submarine Warfare Wing, U.S. Pacific Fleet.  HS-14 originally flew the Sikorsky SH-3H "Sea King" Helicopter out of North Island. The Chargers currently fly the Foxtrot and Hotel versions of the SH-60 airframe built by Sikorsky Aircraft.  Callsign "Lightning," HS-14 is a member of Carrier Air Wing five, stationed at Atsugi, Japan and attached to the USS INDEPENDENCE.  On average, the squadron is manned with roughly 25 officers and technical representatives and 175 enlisted. <br><br>

	The squadron's primary missions is to detect, localize, and destroy enemy submarines while providing over water Search and Rescue (SAR) support to the I-5 (INDEPENDENCE-Carrier Air Wing FIVE) team.  Ever vigilant, the Chargers are prepared around the clock.  Like the SH-3H, the SH-60F has the additional capacity to provide day or night, all- weather Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), anti-ship missile defense, Vertical Boarding/Search and Seizure, and fleet logistics support.  has 27 officers and 174 enlisted personnel. <br><br>
	
Originally assigned to Carrier Air Wing Two, the "Chargers" of HS-14 deployed aboard the USS RANGER (CV-61) from 1984 to 1993, which included the USS RANGER's
final deployment.  In 1991, HS-14 participated in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm and was responsible for the daring capture of four Iraqi commandos on a small island off the coast of Kuwait, as well as the destruction of one Iraqi gunboat and two anti-shipping mines. <br><br>

The squadron's performance in support of Operation Southern Watch in the North Arabian Gulf and Operation Restore Hope off the coast of Somalia set squadron records in total hours, sortie completion rate, and nearly every other measure of squadron effectiveness.  In the North Arabian Gulf extreme heat, the squadron maintained an impressive 98 percent sortie completion rate, and made history by landing the first U.S. aircraft on the deck of a Russian warship, the RNS Admiral Vinogradov, a Udaloy class destroyer.  Off the coast of Somalia in the Indian Ocean from the 8th to the 18th of December 1992, the squadron surged to support Operation Restore Hope. Within a span of just 11 days, HS-14 flew 354 hours in 91 sorties, conducted four medical evacuations, transported over 38,000 pounds of material, 434 passengers, and performed an open ocean rescue. <br><br>

	In 1993, HS-14 supported the USS CONSTELLATION during its transit around South America.  HS-14's short history is highlighted by two Battle Efficiency Awards (1989 and 1992), four CNO Safety Awards and two consecutive DESRON 7 "Golden Arrow" awards for ASW excellence. <br><br>

	1994 proved to be a watershed year for the Chargers as they simultaneously transitioned from the SH-3 airframe to SH-60 airframe while undergoing a homeport change from San Diego, California to Japan. This unprecedented event took place in record time under the watchful eyes of Commander John G. Steele and Commander Peter M. Hyers.  The hectic schedule continued in 1995 as the Chargers immediately got underway with the USS INDEPENDENCE.  Spending 221 days at sea, the Chargers performed miraculously, completing over 4200 hours in the air and performing 10 Medevacs, 2 day rescues, and 4 night rescues.  From being barely able to crawl in the new airframe the year previously, the Chargers were now taking the HS community lead in developing tactics and Standard Operating Procedures for Night Vision Goggle Usage and detachments on Helicopter Capable Ships. <br><br>

	Commander Peter M. Hyers became Commanding Officer HS-14 in January of 1996 and continues to set the pace for the Chargers with new Executive Officer Commander Edward McNamee.<br><br>

<center>CHARGER SYMBOLOGY</center><br>
	The "Chargers" are named for the Battle Horses first bred in ancient times by French Kings.  Known for their exceptional strength and aggressiveness, these horses led the medieval Knights into battle, overcoming their enemies by sheer force and overwhelming dominance.  Displayed in the squadron logo, the Bald Eagle is depicted as the United States symbol of freedom and might while the Lightning Bolt represents the spark of life.  The "Chargers" of HS-14 embody the spirit of these symbols it their relentless defense of the aircraft carrier and their support for the Battle Group.<br>  
Day and Night, Lightning Strikes!

Carrier Air Wing FIVE - VF-154
</title>

<body>
<center>

<h2>Fighter Squadron ONE FIVE FOUR </h2><br>
<br></center>
</b>
<P> "Any Knight, Baby."  Devotees of U.S. Naval Aviation will immediately recognize this phrase as the bywords of Fighter Squadron One Five Four (VF 154), based at NAF Atsugi, Japan.  Flying the Grumman Aerospace F-14A Tomcat air superiority fighter, the Black Knights are on the leading edge of the USS Independence / Carrier Air Wing Five team. <br><br>

VF 154's genesis dates to the formation of VFB 718 on 1 July, 1946.  The squadron was part of the Naval Air Reserve program initiated with the vast expansion of the reserves following WW II.  Based at NAS Floyd Bennett, Brooklyn, NY, the squadron flew F-6F Hellcats and F-4U Corsairs.  The squadron was redesignated VF 68A, then VF 837 and moved to NAS Moffett Field, CA.  As an active reserve squadron, VF 837 first saw combat in Korea while embarked aboard the USS Antietam (CV 36) flying F9F-2 Panthers.  On 4 February, 1953, while steaming toward a second combat tour in Korea embarked on the USS Princeton (CV 37), the squadron was officially redesignated VF 154 when the Princeton passed under the Golden Gate Bridge.  On 15 June, 1953, while flying F9F-5 Panthers in support of forces which successfully recaptured Anchor Hill, VF 154 flew forty-eight combat sorties in a single day, which established a fleet record for a jet squadron. <br><br>

Over the next three decades, the squadron flew F-3J Furies, F-8 Crusaders, and F-4 Phantoms before making the transition to F-14A Tomcats in 1984.  The original insignia of the squadron was a flaming panther;  during the mid-fifties, the nickname "Grand Slammers" was taken.  When VF 154 adopted the supersonic Chance Vought F-8 Crusader in the spring of 1957, the squadron members decided a new symbol was needed to represent them.  Milton Caniff, creator of Steve Canyon, drew the emblem.  Symbolic of the fight for freedom was the figure of the Black Knight.  With his shield, he protected those unable to defend themselves.  With his sword, he struck down the enemies of peace and justice.  He was an ideal figure to represent a front-line fighter squadron of armed Crusaders.  The Black Knight stood, and still stands, ready to strike and destroy any enemy. <br><br>

In February, 1965, the Black Knights led early air strikes against North Vietnam while flying F-8s with Air Wing Fifteen from the deck of the USS Coral Sea (CV 43).  That cruise was the ninth and final deployment with CVW 15, the air wing which originally incorporated VF 837.  The squadron joined Air Wing Two the following year, where it remained until 1980.  The Black Knights deployed to Southeast Asia on seven combat cruises between 1964 and 1973.  Flying from the deck of the Coral Sea for the first two Vietnam cruises and the USS Ranger (CV 61) for the latter five, the Black Knights attacked targets in both North and South Vietnam while flying F-8Ds, F-4Bs, and F-4Js.  The Black Knights were on Yankee Station when American Involvement in South East Asia came to a close. <br><br>

Since making the transition to the F-14A Tomcat, the Black Knights have flown a myriad of missions in support of United States vital interests in the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions.  In 1990, while deployed aboard the USS Independence (CV 62) with Carrier Air Wing Fourteen, the Black Knights provided initial front line deterrence against Iraqi aggression during Operation Desert Shield.  In August, 1991, the Black Knights joined Carrier Air Wing Five and became the first F-14 squadron to deploy with an air-to-ground bomb capability.  As a part of Carrier Air Wing Five, which is forward deployed to NAF Atsugi, Japan, the Black Knights became the first forward deployed Tomcat squadron. <br><br>

Today, VF 154 deploys with Carrier Air Wing Five to the Western Pacific Ocean and the Arabian Gulf, as well as to exercises throughout the Sea of Japan and Pacific Rim.  Squadron detachments also routinely visit exotic locations such as Guam, Okinawa and Iwo Jima, Japan, and Osan, South Korea. <br><br>

The Black Knights continue to lead the most formidable, versatile, and mobile airborne fighting force in existence, serving the call of duty and protecting the interests of freedom the world over.  "Any Time...  Any Place...  Any Knight, Baby." <br><br>

<P> 	Strike Fighter Squadron One Nine Two, the World Famous Golden Dragons, are members of Carrier Air Wing Five embarked in the USS Independence (CV 62) and homeported in Yokosuka, Japan.  The squadron's strength is 22 officers, 10 chief petty officers, and 180 enlisted men. <br><br>

	The World Famous Golden Dragons look back on an illustrious history spanning more than fifty years.  The squadron was established  on 26 March 1945, standing up with the F5F Hellcat.  Since then, the Dragons have flown an impressive lineup:  the F4U Corsair, F9F-5 Panther, F9F-6 Cougar, FJ-4B Fury, A-4D Skyhawk, and the A-7E Corsair II.  Today, the Dragons patrol the skies with the Navy's newest and most capable aircraft ever, the F/A-18 Hornet. <br><br>

	While flying the F9F-5 Panther from the USS Oriskany (CVA 34), the Golden Dragons participated in the filming of the 1953 classic, "The Bridges of Toko Ri".  The squadron aded "World Famous" to its moniker as a result of its appearance in the film. <br><br>

	In 1959, the Dragons started flying the highly successful A-4 Skyhawk from the decks of the USS Bon Homme Richard (CVA 31) and the USS Ticonderoga (CVA 14).  The A-7 Corsair II replaced the A-4 in 1970.  The Dragons flew their Scooters and Corsairs in the skies over Vietnam on six combat deployments between 1964 and 1973.  LCDR Michael  J. Estocin, a Golden Dragon, earned the Congressional Medal of Honor for his gallantry and courage on the 20th and 21st of April 1967 while flying on a missle suppression mission.  In his memory, the Navy's award for the best F/A-18 squadron is called the Michael J. Estocin Award. <br><br>

	After their success in Vietnam, the Dragons made two Mediterranean cruises aboard the USS America (CV 66).  Later, the squadron joined Carrier Air Wing Nine and sailed in the USS Ranger (CV 61).  Between cruises, the Dragons deployed "Marine style" with Marine Air Group Twelve.  The squadron flew its 12 A-7E Corsair II's across the Pacific in June, 1985, and began operating from MCAS Iwakuni, Japan.  During this unique deployment, then VA-192 provided air support for Marine ground units operating throughout the Western Pacific region. <br><br>

	The Golden Dragons returned to their homes in Lemoore, California, in December that year.  The following month, the squadron was redesignated Strike Fighter Squadron 192 (VFA 192), and received its first of 12 McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornets in May.  In November the Dragons again flew to Japan, this time to establish themselves as permanent members of Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5), the Navy's only forward deployed air wing. <br><br>

	While deployed to Japan, the Dragons established themselves as the leaders of the air wing.  In 1989 the squadron received the Commander, Naval Air Force U. S. Pacific Fleet Battle Effectiveness Award, and was later honored with the Michael J. Estocin Award. <br><br>

	On October 2, 1990, the Dragons set sail for the troubled waters of the Arabian Gulf.  The United States had set in motion a firm response to Iraqi aggression against its neighbor, and CVW-5, embarked in USS Midway (CV 41), was chosen to support that stand.  When hostilities broke in January 1991 the Dragons were at the tip of America's sword, raining HARM anti-radiation missles onto Iraqi missile batteries on the first night of Operation Desert Storm.  The Golden Dragons played a crucial role in the conflict by delivering, with pinpoint accuracy, 730,200 pounds of ordnance onto its assigned targets.  The squadron defended the battle group against air and surface targets.  The squadron defended the battle group against air and surface attack while flying Combat Air Patrol and Armed Surface Reconnaisance missions.  The Dragons did not lose an aircraft or pilot during the conflict. <br><br>

	The squadron traded its battle tested F/A-18A's for newer F/A-18C's in September, 1991, as CVW-5 completed an historic swap from the Midway to the Independence in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.  The Dragons deployed again to the Arabian Gulf in 1992 and continue to lead Naval Aviation at America's Tip of the Sword.

<h2> Strike Fighter Squadron ONE NINE FIVE </h2><br>
<br></center>
</b>
<center><h3>Courage, A Tradition</h3></center> 

<P>Strike Fighter Squadron ONE NINE FIVE boasts a proud and exciting history.  Commissioned Torpedo Squadron NINETEEN at Los Alamitos, California in August 1943, the squadron became Attack Squadron TWENTY ABLE in November 1946, Attack Squadron ONE NINE FIVE in August 1948, homeported at Moffett Field, California, and Strike Fighter Squadron ONE NINE FIVE on 1 April 1985. </P> 

<P>As a unit of CVG 19 during World War II, VA-195, flying the TBM "Avenger," was a part of Admiral "Bull" Halsey's Naval Force which "hit hard, hit fast, and hit often."  The squadron participated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf and the landings at Guam, Palau, Morotai and Leyte.  Squadron pilots also flew strikes against the Carolines, Philippines, Bonin Island, Okinawa, Mindanao and Formosa while embarked in USS LEXINGTON. </P> 

<P>In May 1947, Attack Squadron 20 Able transitioned to the AD-1 "Skyraider."  The squadron participated in the Korean War while embarked in USS PRINCETON.  During the deployment, on 2 May 1951, the squadron's Skyraiders, making precise low level runs, delivered aerial torpedoes on the heavily defended and strategically positioned Hwachon Dam in North Korea.  Destruction of the dam had been attempted by both Air Force and Navy bombers, but was finally accomplished by Attack Squadron 20 Able earning them the nickname "Dambusters." </P> 

<P>Attack Squadron ONE NINE FIVE transitioned from the propeller driven "Skyraiders" (also known as "Spads") to the jet powered A-4 "Skyhawk" in July 1959 and moved to NAS Lemoore, California in January 1962.  As the Vietnam crisis flared in the fall of 1964, the DAMBUSTERS made their fourth consecutive deployment on USS BON HOMME RICHARD with the SEVENTH FLEET.  During the next 5 years, while operating various models of the  A-4 from the BON HOMME RICHARD and USS TICONDEROGA, the squadron logged more combat flight hours and sorties than any other squadron in Air Wing NINETEEN. </P> 

<P>In the spring of 1970, VA-195 went through another face lift as it transitioned to the A-7E Corsair II.  As a unit of Carrier Air Wing ELEVEN, on USS KITTY HAWK, the squadron deployed in the fall of 1970, marking its fourth consecutive decade of involvement in foreign conflicts.  During the Vietnam War, VA-195 delivered the first data link version of the television guided Walleye Glide Bomb in combat.  Success was sweet on 19 July 1972 as the DAMBUSTERS delivered a single Walleye down the throat of a cave storage area, causing its complete destruction.  Later that day, they destroyed the Ninh Binh railroad bridge, also with a single weapon.  VA-195's performance during the 1972 deployment was spectacular, setting new records in sorties flown, ordnance delivered, and days of combat operations. </P> 

<P>Three more peacetime WESTPAC deployments aboard USS KITTY HAWK, and the development of the CV concept, kept the squadron a combat ready force from 1973 to 1978.  In 1979 and again in 1981, the DAMBUSTERS made back-to-back East Coast deployments aboard USS AMERICA.  In 1981, the DAMBUSTERS shared in making history as the USS AMERICA became the largest warship ever to transit the Suez Canal. </P> 

<P>The DAMBUSTERS were assigned to Carrier Air Wings FIFTEEN and NINETEEN before joining Carrier Air Wing NINE late in 1982.  VA-195 deployed in 1983 to Central America and the Western Pacific before making a 122 day line period in the Indian Ocean. </P> 

<P>The DAMBUSTERS were redesignated Strike Fighter Squadron ONE NINE FIVE on 1 April 1985 and commenced transition to the F/A-18 Hornet.  After the transition was complete, VFA-195 was assigned to Carrier Air Wing 5 and officially changed its homeport to Yokosuka, Japan on 15 November 1986.  The squadron embarked in USS MIDWAY (CV-41) and made deployments to the Indian Ocean during the fall of 1988 and again in 1989 along with several shorter deployments in the Western Pacific.  While ashore, the DAMBUSTERS operate out of NAF Atsugi, Japan. </P> 

<P>The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 increased world tensions and set the stage for  armed conflict between the United States and Iraq.  As a result, the United States and its allies joined forces in Operation Desert Shield with the goal of liberating Kuwait from Iraq.  In November of 1990, the USS MIDWAY and Carrier Air Wing FIVE arrived in the Arabian Gulf, relieving the USS INDEPENDENCE and assuming the duties of a forward deployed battle force in support of Operation Desert Shield.  While diplomacy and economic sanctions took their course, the DAMBUSTERS planned and trained heavily in preparation for combat.  Extensive training proved invaluable when diplomacy was abandoned and the liberation of Kuwait began on 17 January 1991.  During Desert Storm, the DAMBUSTERS flew 564 combat sorties, delivered 356 tons of ordnance, and became the first fleet Hornet squadron to deliver the television guided Walleye II glide bomb in combat.  The DAMBUSTERS' outstanding performance and precision bombing were an integral part of the Coalition Forces' defeat of Iraq and liberation of Kuwait. </P> 

<P>On 25 August 1991, the DAMBUSTERS completed their tour of duty in USS MIDWAY.  Now stationed onboard USS INDEPENDENCE, VFA-195 has completed three cruises to the Middle East and maintains its combat ready status.  Their most recent visit to the Middle East was from August to June 1995 where they deployed in support of Operation Southern Watch, their second such deployment. </P> 

<P>Strike Fighter Squadron ONE NINE FIVE has historically played a major role in every American conflict since World War II.  Courage and accomplishment have become a tradition on the DAMBUSTER team.  The squadron is again deployed to WESTPAC/Indian Ocean/Arabian Gulf, the DAMBUSTERS look forward to continuing their proud and courageous history as part of Carrier Air Wing Five aboard USS INDEPENDENCE.  CHIPPY HO! </P>

<h2> Attack Squadron ONE ONE FIVE</h2>
<h2>Command History </h2><br>
<br></center>
</b>
	<P> On 10 October 1942, the predecessor of Attack Squadron ONE ONE FIVE (VA-115) was commissioned as Torpedo Squadron ELEVEN (VT-11) by the Navy Department.  Pilots and crews found themselves strapping into the "new" Grumman designed TBM AVENGER, a carrier based torpedo bomber affectionately known in the fleet as the "Turkey."  So began the history of one of the oldest naval aviation squadrons still in commission in the Pacific Fleet, a history which grows more distinguished each year. <br><br>

	In June 1943, CVG-11 pilots conducted the first daylight raids on Bougainvilla and the Solomon Islands from USS HORNET (CV-12).  They also made bombing attacks on such places as Manda, Villa, and Rahili during desperate fighting for the Solomons and New Georgia.  When the war ended, Torpedo Squadron ELEVEN was redesignated Attack Squadron TWELVE ABLE (VA-12A). <br><br>

	VA-12A underwent extensive retraining before embarking aboard USS VALLEY FORGE (CVA-45), then the Navy's newest carrier.  The globe-circling cruise that ensued was the first for a Navy Air Group, and a milestone for the squadron. A symbolic globe was later to become part of the squadron's official emblem. <br><br>

	In July 1948, VA-12A was again redesignated, this time as Attack Squadron ONE ONE FIVE (VA-115).  In addition, the Navy's newest, most powerful, and what was to be its last propeller-driven fighter-bomber, the Douglas built AD-1 SKYRAIDER, replaced the older TBM's. <br><br>
	During the Korean War, VA-115 flew 2,268 combat missions involving close air support, long range strikes, and reconnaissance missions.  For its outstanding performance in destroying enemy targets, the squadron was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. <br><br>

	During the peacetime deployment that followed, the squadron adopted the nickname "ARABS" after a passage through the Suez Canal and was named the winner of the coveted Battle Efficiency Award in 1960.  In October 1965, the squadron returned to Southeast Asia, this time on board USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63), to aid the U.S. effort in South Vietnam.  While serving on the line for six months in the Gulf of Tonkin, VA-115's twenty  aircrew flew 2,051 sorties, 8,012 hours, and delivered 6,920,000 pounds of ordnance against enemy targets. <br><br>

	In September 1966, VA-115 became an integral component of Carrier Air Wing FIVE; however, the squadron was decommissioned in July 1967.  In 1970, VA-115 was recommissioned and relocated at NAS Whidbey Island, Washington while transitioning to the Grumman A-6A INTRUDER. <br><br>

	In 1971, as part of CVW-5  on board USS MIDWAY (CV-41), VA-115 made their first WESTPAC combat deployment in the A-6A Intruder.  For their subsequent April 1972 deployment to the Vietnam conflict, the Arabs were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.  In September 1973, MIDWAY and VA-115 became part of the Navy's only forward deployed battle group when they changed their homeport to Yokosuka, Japan.  In April 1975, MIDWAY was again called to Vietnam to participate in Operations EAGLE PULL and FREQUENT WIND, the evacuation of Saigon. <br><br>

	VA-115 was the last actively commissioned Navy squadron to fly the A-6A/A-6B, transitioning to the A-6E in the summer of 1977.  In March 1978, VA-115 changed their nickname from "ARABS" to "EAGLES." <br><br>

	In 1980, the squadron received the new A-6E TRAM aircraft and was awarded its second consecutive Battle Efficiency award from COMNAVAIRPAC.  In September 1983 the EAGLES provided rescue support following the Soviet shootdown of Korean Airlines Flight 007 in September 1983. <br><br>

	In 1985, VA-115 was named "West Coast Intruder Squadron of the Year,"  and in October 1987, the squadron decreased in size to nine aircraft with the addition of the "NIGHTHAWKS" of VA-185 to CVW-5.  The EAGLES then deployed to the Indian Ocean, providing safe passage for reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf during Operation EARNEST WILL.  In 1988, the EAGLES participated in the Summer Olympic Games security operations off the coast of Korea. <br><br>

	On October 2, 1990 the EAGLES deployed to the North Arabian Gulf in support of Operation DESERT SHIELD.  On the 17th of January 1991, EAGLE Intruders were among the first to launch from USS MIDWAY to mark the beginning of Operation DESERT STORM.  During the six week war against Iraq, the EAGLES phenomenal performance included 463 combat sorties which resulted in 953 total combat hours and 724,000 pounds of ordnance delivered on enemy targets throughout Iraq and occupied Kuwait.  The squadron also led CVW-5 in the destruction of Iraqi naval vessels with 12 confirmed kills, all without a single loss of aircraft or men. <br><br>

	In July 1991, VA-185 disestablished, transferring many of her aircraft, officers, and men to the EAGLES.  After an August 1991 transit to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, a historic cross deck move from USS MIDWAY (CV-41) to USS INDEPENDENCE (CV-62) was completed.  In September, the EAGLES received six of the fleet's newest A-6E SWIP aircraft. <br><br>

	In April 1992 VA-115 deployed on board USS INDEPENDENCE to the Arabian Gulf, where they participated in the initial phase of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH in support of United Nation resolutions against Iraq.  During three weeks of conducting around the clock flight operations, EAGLE aircrew flew 115 combat missions over Iraq.  For their superb performance, the EAGLES were awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation.  In November 1993, the EAGLES, with a complete complement of A-6E SWIP aircraft, deployed to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. By the close of the deployment, the EAGLES boasted tremendous statistics to include a 99% sortie completion rate that encompassed 618 consecutive sorties and earned the CVW-5 "Golden Wrench Award". Two months later the squadron deployed once again to participate in RIMPAC Exercises. The EAGLES again distinguished themselves as the  workhorse of CVW-5 by achieving a 100% sortie completion rate and providing a long range medium attack platform for the Air Wing to exploit the opposition. In addition, VA-115 received four of six new aircraft that were to be delivered during the summer of 1994 to give the EAGLES passive Night Vision capability.  The EAGLES extended their string of consecutive deployed sorties without a miss to over 1300. <br><br>

     In September 1994, VA-115 participated in its final Medium Attack Advanced Readiness program, deploying to Andersen AFB, Guam.  For sustained meritorious performance from 1 October 1993 to 31 December 1994, the EAGLES were awarded yet another Meritorious Unit Commendation.  In April 1995 VA-115 deployed onboard USS INDEPENDENCE for their Tailored Training Assessment and to the Gulf of Thailand for COBRA GOLD.  In July 1995, the squadron competed for the second year in a row in the Intruder Derby at NAS Whidbey Island, Washington.  The EAGLES were named Intruder Maintenance Squadron of the Year for 1995. <br><br>

     In August 1995, VA-115 commenced its final Indian Ocean/Arabian Gulf deployment, participating in Operation SOUTHERN WATCH/VIGILANT SENTINEL, INDIGO DESERT and EAGER ARCHER. <br><br>

	A "can do" spirit and team effort have been VA-115's trademarks for over fifty years.  In keeping with their motto, the EAGLES have consistently demonstrated that they are, and continue to be, the "Best Attack in WESTPAC." <br><br>

<img src="VAQ136lg.gif"></a><img src="VAQ136P.jpg"></a><br>
<h2> Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron ONE THREE SIX</h2><br>
<br></center>
</b><P>       Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron ONE THREE SIX was established at Naval Air Station, Whidbey Island, Oak Harbor, Washington on April 6, 1973.  VAQ 136 has the distinction of being the fifth operational Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron to employ the EA-6B Prowler, and also is the first Prowler Squadron to be formed with no heritage passed down from a previous Naval Aviation Squadron or unit. <br><br>


      Since their establishment in 1973, the VAQ 136 Gauntlets have integrated rapidly into several Carrier Air Wings.  The Gauntlets' first two deployments were with CVW 11 aboard the USS KITTY HAWK (CV 63).  In 1977 the Gauntlets joined the CVW 7 aboard the USS INDEPENDENCE (CV 62) for a cruise to the Mediterranean, after which the squadron changed to the ICAP version of the EA-6B.  After the transition to their new aircraft, the Gauntlets sailed to the Mediterranean again, this time with CVW 5 on the USS SARATOGA (CV 60). <br><br>


      In 1980 the Gauntlets flew across the Pacific Ocean to their new home in Yokosuka, Japan with the USS MIDWAY (CV 41) and Carrier Air Wing Five.  The 1980's were highlighted by numerous Gauntlet achievements such as: an unprecedented 8300 mile crossdeck deployment to the USS AMERICA (CV 66) in support of Indian Ocean operations in 1983, the record setting 111 day Indian Ocean at sea period in 1984, the transition to ICAP II aircraft in 1986, the cruise to support the Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea in 1988, and the culmination of a decade of hard work was evidenced by the Gauntlets being awarded the COMNAVAIRPAC Battle Efficiency Award - the "E", and the Safety "S" in 1989. <br><br>


      On April 16, 1990, as part of the Cope Thunder exercise, the Gauntlets fired a live High Speed Anti Radiation Missile (HARM), at a U.S. Air Force radar off the coast of the Philippines.  It was the first HARM fired in WESTPAC and the exercise was a great success.  The missile completely destroyed its target and foreshadowed things to come in the Gauntlets' future. <br><br>


      On January 16, 1991 the Gauntlets were the first Prowler squadron to fly a strike against Iraq in support of Operation Desert Storm.  During the 43 day war against Iraq, the Gauntlets flew 466.9 hours in combat and fired 28 HARM missiles.  The Gauntlets successfully suppressed the enemy's air defenses ensuring that CVW 5 did not lose a single aircraft to enemy fire.  The Gauntlets proved that the Prowler is an indispensable part of the Navy's attack team. <br><br>


      A new chapter in Gauntlet history began on August 22, 1991.  With the scheduled retirement of the USS MIDWAY (CV 41), the Gauntlets crossdecked to the United States' new forward deployed carrier, the USS INDEPENDENCE (CV 62) in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. <br><br>


The Gauntlets turned around with no delay and set out on their first deployment aboard the USS INDEPENDENCE (CV-62).  That deployment saw the beginning of Operation Southern Watch in southern Iraq with the Gauntlets once again playing a crucial role in protecting the fighter assets below the 32nd parallel.  For their role in setting up Operation Southern Watch, the Gauntlets received the Pacific Fleet Battle Efficiency award for 1992.  In addition, the Gauntlets received the Radford Award for best EA-6B squadron in the Navy, the Association of Old Crows Outstanding Unit Award, and a Meritorious Unit Commendation. <br><br>


    During its twenty-two year history the Gauntlets have had eighteen Commanding Officers.  Commander Thomas R. McCool assumed command on March 9, 1995. Under his command the Gauntlets have continued their dedicated service with CV 62 and CVW 5 in supporting national commitments around the world.  VAQ 136 continues to maintain a prominent position in the Tactical Electronic Warfare community by their outstanding performance "at the Tip of the Sword."

<h2>Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron ONE ONE FIVE</h2><br>
</center>
</b>
<P>
<center><h2>THE GRUMMAN E-2C HAWKEYE AIRCRAFT</h2></center>

 <p>The E-2C mission of Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C)
consists of detecting, identifying, and tracking long range threats
to the carrier battle group.  Additional missions include air
intercept and air combat control, surface search and surveillance
control, strike control for coordinated attacks, communications
relay, and search and rescue control. </p>

  <p>In addition to the United States, four other countries
currently employ the E-2C Hawkeye aircraft:  Egypt, Israel,
Singapore and Japan.  The aircraft may be easily identified by its
24-foot diameter rotodome and four vertical tails.  The E-2C flight
crew will normally consist of a Pilot (P), Copilot (CP), Combat
Information Center Officer (CICO), Aircraft Control Officer (ACO),
and Radar Officer (RO). </p>

  <p>There are two versions of E-2C Hawkeye aircraft being flown by
the U.S. Navy.  Built during the early 1970s, the "Group 0" uses
the APS 138 radar and is powered by two Allison T-56-A-425
turboprop engines with constant speed Hamilton-Standard propellers. 
Each engine develops a maximum of 4,600 Indicated Horsepower (IHP)
at takeoff.  The "Group II" began entering the U.S. Fleet in the
early 1990s and is scheduled to replace all remaining "Group 0"
aircraft within the next ten years.  The "Group II" uses the APS-
145 radar (which provides improved detection) and is powered by two
T-56-A-427 turboprop engines with a maximum of 5,100 IHP at
takeoff. </p>

   <h3><center>   UNITED STATES NAVY E-2C HAWKEYE SQUADRONS</h3></center> 

  <p>  There are currently 11 E-2C squadrons in the U.S. Navy.  The
East Coast squadrons, located in Norfolk, Virginia are:  VAW-120
"Greyhawks" (training squadron), VAW-121 "Blue Tails", VAW-123
"Screwtops" (currently transitioning to Group II aircraft), VAW-
124 "Bear Aces", VAW-125 "Tiger Tails", and VAW-126 "Seahawks". 
Flying "Group II" Hawkeyes, the West Coast squadrons, located in
Miramar, California are: VAW-112 "Golden Hawks", VAW-113 "Black
Eagles", VAW-116 "Sun Kings" and VAW-117 "Wall Bangers".</p>

    <p>Considered a West Coast squadron, the VAW-115 "Liberty Bells"
are attached to Carrier Air Wing 5, embarked on the USS
INDEPENDENCE (CV-62), as part of Forward Deployed Naval Forces
homeported in Yokosuka, Japan.  Its home airfield, Naval Air
Facility (NAF) Atsugi, is located in Ayase-Shi, Japan.  Due to
its overseas location, the Liberty Bells enjoy a myriad of
opportunities and challenges that are unique to forward deployed
units.  Being in the Far East, Carrier Air Wing FIVE often enjoys 
exciting liberty portcalls to Hawaii, Thailand, Philippines,
Australia, Singapore, Republic of Korea, and Hong Kong.  Since
USS INDEPENDENCE does not follow the traditional deployment
schedule of aircraft carriers homeported in the United States
(six months at sea followed by one year in port), VAW-115 engages
in a diverse and dynamic training schedule, often participating
in multinational exercises and joint cooperation with U.S. Air
Force assets. </p><br>

 <h3><center>   COMMAND HISTORY</h3></center>  

   <p>   Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron ONE ONE FIVE
(VAW-115) was commissioned on 20 April 1967.  During its
assignment to Attack Carrier Wing 2, VAW-115 completed three
deployments to the Western Pacific Ocean aboard USS RANGER
(CVA-61). </p>

    <p>  The squadron transitioned from the E-1B "Willie Fudd" to the
E-2B in 1970 and joined Carrier Air Wing 5 aboard USS MIDWAY
(CV-41).  VAW-115 made two extensive deployments between May 1971
and April 1973 involving combat missions in the Gulf of Tonkin. 
On 11 September 1973, the Liberty Bells departed Alameda,
California, embarked on USS MIDWAY bound for Yokosuka, Japan to
become part of the only carrier and air wing to homeport outside
the continental United States.  For the period January 1973
through June 1974, VAW-115 was awarded the COMNAVAIRPAC Battle
Efficiency "E" as the finest E-2B Squadron in the Naval Air
Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet.  During April 1975, the USS MIDWAY
participated in operation FREQUENT WIND off the coast of South
Vietnam during the evacuation of Saigon.  In October 1975, MIDWAY
departed Yokosuka for the first of many cruises to the Indian
Ocean. </p>

   <p>   The operational expertise of VAW-115 was recognized with the
Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Aviation Safety Award in January
1976.  In March 1976, the Bells received their second consecutive
Battle Efficiency "E" award and the "AEW Excellence" Award.  In
1977 the squadron earned its second consecutive CNO Safety Award. 
During 1978 the Liberty Bells were again awarded the Battle
Efficiency "E" and the "AEW Excellence" Award.  With only two
days notice, VAW-115 began its third Indian Ocean deployment in
April 1979.  The achievements during the three-month cruise
resulted in the award of a Navy Unit Commendation as well as the
Navy Expeditionary Medal.  September started the squadron's
fourth Indian Ocean deployment. </p>

 <p>     As a result of the Iranian seizure of the American Embassy in
Tehran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the cruise was
extended into February 1980 and the squadron was again awarded the
Navy Expeditionary Medal, as well as the Meritorious Unit
Commendation.  The fifth and sixth Indian Ocean deployments, from
August through November 1980 and February through June 1981,
yielded two more Navy Expeditionary Medals.  In the fall of 1982,
the Liberty Bells became the first VAW squadron to operate in the
Northern Pacific in over ten years.  In the spring of 1983, another
NORPAC deployment put VAW-115 in a three carrier battle group for
FLEETEX '83.  In September 1983, VAW-115 participated in the
search, rescue and salvage operations following the tragic
shootdown of Korean Airlines Flight 007 off the coast of northern
Japan.  The squadron was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation
and a Letter of Appreciation from the Republic of Korea.  VAW-115
was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation for extensive
operations conducted by Battle Group ALFA from July 1982 through
May 1984.  Also in 1984, the Liberty Bells left on their seventh
and longest deployment to the Indian Ocean in January 1984,
spending 111 consecutive days at sea. </p>

  <p>    In the spring of 1985, VAW-115 transitioned to the E-2C
Hawkeye.  Following this transition the Liberty Bells embarked for
another Indian Ocean cruise, returning to Atsugi in October.  On
31 December, 1985, a formal sister-squadron relationship with the
JASDF 601 AEW Squadron was signed, thus beginning a new era of
cooperation between the U.S. and the Japanese in the field of
mutual defense.  Deploying again in April 1987, the squadron and
CVW-5 operated in several exercises with the Royal Australian Navy
and a HARPOONEX in July with USAF B-52s.  Flying from Atsugi in
September, VAW-115 and units of VQ-1 supported contingency
operations for FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION conducted by the USS OLDENDORF
in the Sea of Japan.  The squadron again deployed to the Indian
Ocean on 15 October to support EARNEST WILL tanker escort
operations in the North Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf.  While off
Singapore, the Liberty Bells held exchange visits and flights with
Royal Singaporean Air Force (RSAF) 111 AEW Squadron and signed a
sister-squadron agreement on 20 February 1988.  VAW-115 was awarded
it's fourth Battle Efficiency "E" for the period July 1986 to
December 1987.  This deployment also resulted in VAW-115 being
awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for support of
escorting reflagged tankers in the Persian Gulf.  In August 1989,
Battle Group ALPHA left Japan for another Indian Ocean cruise, with
stops in Singapore and Thailand.  Following a brief time
"on-station" in the Indian Ocean, the MIDWAY made port visits to
Mombasa, Kenya, and Perth, Australia.  Shortly after departing
Subic Bay, Philippines, Battle Group ALPHA was involved in
contingency operations in support of the Philippine government
during operation CLASSIC RESOLVE, earning VAW-115 the Armed Forces
Expeditionary Medal. </p>

<p>      On 2 October 1990 Battle Group ALPHA left Japan, deploying in
support of Operation DESERT SHIELD.  Enroute, VAW-115 sent an
airplane to Singapore on 18 October to participate in
sister-squadron flights with the Singaporean E-2 squadron, RSAF
111.  During Operation DESERT SHIELD, VAW-115 flew in support of
various exercises:  IMMINENT THUNDER, FREE LUNCH,  EAGER ANVIL, and
BEACON FLASH.  While at sea in support of Operation DESERT STORM,
the Liberty Bells flew 691.3 total flight hours and 179 combat
sorties.  In late February 1992, VAW-115 participated in sister-
squadron operations, including exchange flights, with the JASDF 601
AEW, thus broadening the mutual defense between the U.S. and
Japanese.  On 23 May 1992, the Liberty Bells left Japan, deploying
for four months to the Persian Gulf, returning in October 1992. 
During their deployment, VAW-115 supported Operation SOUTHERN
WATCH, controlling USN, USAF, and coalition air forces over the
skies of southern Iraq.  On 17 November 1993, CVW-5 and VAW-115
departed for a 4-month deployment to the Persian Gulf,
participating in several exercises including a combined MINEX in
the Gulf of Thailand and sister-squadron operations with the RSAF
111 E-2 Squadron.  In December 1993, VAW-115 participated in cross
aircrew training with the 963 AWACS in support of Operation
SOUTHERN WATCH, deploying to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  VAW-115 went on
to fly 125 sorties with 100 percent completion rate during January
and February of 1994.  After returning from deployment in mid-March
of 1994, VAW-115 set sail in support of RIMPAC '94 in June,
controlling and conducting numerous War-at-Sea strikes, and joint
combined surface and air scenarios.  During the period of mid-July
through August 1994, tense political conditions with North Korea
necessitated CVW-5 and VAW-115 maintaining a "Ready-for-Sea"
posture, alternating sea periods with short inport periods in
support of national emergent operational tasking.  The Bells'
performance through the course of 1994 earned the squadron the
Commander Naval Air Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet's Battle "E" Award. </p>

 <p>  While operating in the Gulf of Thailand in May 1995, VAW-115
provided AEW for numerous overland strike and air defense
exercises.  In September 1995, the Bells returned to the Persian
Gulf region in support of Operation SOUTHERN WATCH.  In November
1995, the Liberty Bells flew in support of ANNUALEX, a joint United
States/Japan exercise.  The Bells flew numerous AEW, War-at-Sea,
strike and air defense missions that included control of U.S. Air
Force and Japanese self-defense force assets. </p>

   <p>  In February 1996, VAW-115 participated in exercise VALIANT
USHER.  Working in South Korean airspace with U.S. Air Force
assets, VAW-115 provided AEW and airborne control  in coordinated
strikes, amphibious landings and combat search and rescue
operations.  Prior to its return to Japan, the USS INDEPENDENCE was
delayed off the coast of Taiwan due to escalating tensions between
China and Taiwan. </p>

    <p>  As the only forward deployed E-2C Hawkeye squadron in the
United States Navy, VAW-115 continues to lead the way in readiness
and performance while operating in the highly demanding environment
of the Far East and Western Pacific. </p><br>

Carrier Air Wing FIVE - VS-21
</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<img src="vs21lg.gif"></a><img src="vs21P.JPG"></a><br>
<h2> Sea Control Squadron TWO ONE<br> "Fighting Redtails" </h2><br>
<br></center>
</b>
<P> 


	The origin of VS-21 can be traced back to March 26, 1945 when Escort Carrier Air Group FORTY ONE (CVEG-41) was established.  This new squadron was formed by merging Fighting FORTY ONE (VF-41) and Torpedo FORTY ONE (VT-41).  VF-41 was equipped with the Ryan FR-1 "Fireball" fighter-bomber, earning the distinction of becoming the first navy squadron to fly a jet powered aircraft.  VT-41 flew the Grumman TBM-3E "Avenger", the finest carrier-based patrol/attack aircraft of its day.  Together under one command, they formed a very formidable anti-submarine "Hunter-Killer" team.  On November 15, 1946, CVEG-41 was redesignated as Escort Carrier Air Group ONE (CVEG-1) to become one of only two air groups dedicated to developing carrier-based Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) tactics and conducting fleet ASW operations.  In early 1948, the FR-1 "Fireball" was replaced by the Grumman F6F-5N "Hellcat" night fighter-bomber.  On September 1, 1948, CVEG-1 was redesignated as Composite Squadron TWO ONE (VC-21).  VC-21 retained only the extremely capable patrol/attack TBM-3E "Avenger" as fighter-bombers were no longer deemed necessary to the ASW role. <br><br>

	In April 1950 VC-21 was redesignated as Air Anti-Submarine Squadron TWO ONE (VS-21).  Three months later, on July 4, 1950, the Fighting Redtails became the first carrier-based squadron to depart the United States for the Korean War.  Flying the TBM-3E from Japan, a squadron detachment assisted in the evacuation of wounded from Kotori Airstrip near the Chosan Reservoir prior to its loss to communist Chinese ground forces.  After the squadron returned to NAS North Island, San Diego, in February 1951, VS-21 began transitioning to the Grumman AF-2 "Guardian" series aircraft.  Again, the Redtails returned to the two plane search-attack/hunter-killer concept with the AF-2W "Hunter" and AF-2S "Killer" team. <br><br>

	In December 1954, VS-21 became the first West Coast VS squadron to receive the new Grumman S-2F "Tracker".  The "Tracker" was specifically designed as a single mission ASW platform, combining both the search-attack and hunter-killer missions into one aircraft.  Following their successful deployment on the USS PRINCETON (CVS-37), the Redtails were awarded the Commander, Naval Air Force, United States Pacific Fleet Battle Efficiency "E", the first VS squadron to ever win this widely coveted award.  After follow-on deployments on USS KEARSAGE and USS PHILIPPINE SEA, VS-21 divided to become the new VS-21 and her sister squadron, VS-29. <br><br>

	The "Sixties" was a decade of support roles and expanding tactical responsibilities.  After assisting in the recovery of two Project Mercury capsules, SIGMA 7 and FAITH 7, VS-21 made her first deployment to the South China Sea in support of Vietnam operations.  It was here that the new role of shipping surveillance and interdiction was first introduced to the VS community as a primary mission. <br><br>

	In 1974, VS-21 was selected to introduce the Lockheed S-3A "Viking" ASW aircraft to the fleet.  The twin turbo fan powered "Viking", with its advanced electronics, computer technology and high performance flight capabilities, was designed to meet the increasingly lethal Soviet guided-missile submarine threat of the 1970's.  VS-21 sailed into the Mediterranean Sea onboard USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (CV-67) on the first Viking deployment in February 1975.  That same year, the "Redtails" won the Battle Efficiency "E", the CNO Safety Award, and the Captain Arnold J. Isbell Trophy for ASW excellence.  Since then, VS-21 has made multiple deployments on the USS CONSTELLATION (CV-64), USS KITTY HAWK (CV-63), USS RANGER (CV-61), and the USS ENTERPRISE (CVN-65), ending with her famous "Round the World" cruise of 1990. <br><br>

	Leading the charge again, VS-21 was selected by Commander, Naval Air Force, United States Pacific Fleet to be the first West Coast squadron to transition to the Lockheed S-3B.  This transition was complete in April 1991 following training at NAS Cecil Field, Florida.  The "Bravo" version maintains the same airframe and flight systems as the S-3A, but incorporated an extensive Weapons System Improvement Program that added an advanced imaging capable ISAR RADAR, state-of-the-art Electronic Support Measures (ESM) and Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) systems, and vastly improved ASW capability.  In addition to ASW, the S-3B now employs the AGM-84C Harpoon anti-ship missile in the anti-submarine warfare (ASUW) role and uses its superior ESM system to passively locate and track targets as an independent electronic warfare (EW) platform.  In August 1991, VS-21 embarked aboard USS INDEPENDENCE (CV-62) and joined Carrier Airwing FIVE (CVW-5) to become the first permanently forward deployed VS squadron in the history of the United States Navy.  In keeping with the S-3B's phenomenal multi-mission capability, VS-21 was redesignated as Sea Control Squadron TWO ONE, in September 1993.  The "Fighting Redtails" now reside with the rest of CVW-5 at NAF Atsugi, Japan. <br><br>

	VS-21 has been awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation, the Navy Expeditionary Medal, two Armed Forces Expeditionary Medals, the Joint Meritorious  Unit Award, six Commander Naval Air Force United States Pacific Fleet Battle Efficiency "E" Awards, five Chief of Naval Operations Safety Awards, four Arnold J. Isbell Awards for ASW Excellence, the Commander, Air Anti-Submarine Wing United States Pacific Fleet Top Torpedo Award, the Commander Mine Warfare Command "Miner of the Year" Award, two Golden Anchor and one Silver Anchor Awards, and most recently, the Commander Seventh Fleet Award for ASW Excellence.

<br><center><h1>RIMPAC 96<BR>Multi-National Force:<br><br>11th Marine Expeditionary Unit</center></h1>
<hr>
Since World War II, in nearly every crisis in which the United States has deployed projection forces, the first military units in position to move ashore with sufficient sustainability for prolonged operations, have been from one of America’s Fleet Marine Forces.  These forces have been organized into Marine Air Ground Task Forces (MAGTF) -- a combination of  air, ground and support assets.<br>
MAGTF’s are established for specific missions, or in anticipation of a wide range of possible missions.  Combining air, ground, and logistic assets maximizes the combat power of each of the war-fighting elements.  Tailoring of MAGTF’s is based on detailed analysis of specific situations as well as historical data which has been compiled by Marine Corps planners over the past several decades.<br>
MAGTF’s have long provided the United States with a broad spectrum of response options  when U.S. and allied interests have been threatened and in noncombat situations which require  instant response to crisis.  Selective, timely and credible commitment of air-ground units have, on many occasions, helped bring stability to a region and sent signals world wide to aggressors that the United States is not only willing to defend its interests, but able to do so with a significantly powerful force on extremely short notice.<br>
The Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is the smallest of the MAGTF’s.  Together, with its Navy brethren they serve as the Nation’s forward deployed, quick response team, capable of accomplishing numerous missions around the globe.<br>
The MEU, directed by a single commander, is comprised of approximately 2,200 Marines and Sailors embarked aboard three ships along with the Marines and Sailors stationed on those ships and the Amphibious Squadron (PHIBRON), which commands the three ship Amphibious Task Group (ATG).<br>
The 11th MEU working with PHIBRON-5 and the USS Essex ATG comprises one such Navy/Marine team.  The 11th MEU, commanded by Col. Robert B. Blose, Jr., is one of three West Coast based MAGTF’s from the Camp Pendleton, Calif. based 1st Marine Expeditionary Force.  These MEU’s  are routinely rotated through the Western Pacific, Arabian Gulf and other areas for six months at a time.<br>
The MEU’s major elements are the Command Element (CE), the Ground Combat Element (GCE), the Aviation Combat Element (ACE), and the Combat Service Support Element (CSSE).  The 11th MEU's GCE is Battalion Landing Team, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines commanded by LtCol. Michael A. Sovacool;  the ACE is Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron (HMM)-166 (Reinforced) commanded by LtCol. Stuart R. McMeans; the CSSE is MEU Service Support Group-11 (MSSG) commanded by LtCol. Robert E. Gerlaugh.<br>
The CE is comprised of the Commanding Officer and supporting staff.  It provides the command and coordination essential for effective planning and execution of operations.  It also contains the reconnaissance, intelligence and electronic warfare capabilities and fire support assets from Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company.  In addition, the MEU CE is reinforced with specialized detachments, such as reconnaissance and surveillance elements,  radio reconnaissance and electronic countermeasure teams, and intelligence and counterintelligence assets.<br>
The GCE for a MEU is the BLT.  Formed around an  infantry battalion, the BLT is reinforced with artillery, assault amphibian vehicles, combat engineers, an antiarmor section and light armored vehicles.  The mixture and number of pieces of such types of equipment are tailored to the mission -- or anticipated missions -- of the deploying MEU, and may also be influenced by mode of transport.<br>
The ACE provides air support.  Composition is based on the tactical situation, the MAGTF's mission and size, and space limitations within the ATG.  The ACE can vary within MAGTF's from a reinforced squadron to one or more Marine Aircraft Wings.  For the 11th MEU it is a reinforced CH-46 squadron.<br>
The ACE is capable of conducting a full range of  air operations and is comprised of appropriate Marine Aircraft Wing assets, which include rotary wing aircraft (helicopters) such as the CH-53E Super Stallion, CH-46 Sea Knight, UH-1N Huey, and AH-1W Super Cobra and the vertical/short take off/landing AV-8B Harrier. The MEU  also has two KC-130 transport refueller aircraft on standby at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, Calif.  Additionally, to ensure self sufficiency, the ACE has air traffic control, aircraft maintenance/support, and aviation logistics/supply support assets.<br>
The final major piece of the MEU is the CSSE.  For the MEU it is a MEU Service Support Group.  The mission of the MSSG is to provide combat support , specifically: supply; maintenance; transportation; explosive ordnance disposal; military police; disbursing (pay services); water production and distribution; engineering; medical and dental services; fuel storage and distribution; and other services to the deployed MEU.  Relatively small in numbers, usually with less than 300 Marines and Sailors, the MSSG has a wide range of capabilities, with each Marine and Sailor contributing  his own specialized skill to ensure that the personnel and equipment of the combat arms are ready for, and sustained during, combat or contingency operations.<br>
The MEU is unique in that its air and ground combat elements are combined with combat service support under one commander -- the MEU commanding officer.  This air-ground task force concept is designed to thoroughly exploit the combat power inherent in air and ground assets by closely integrating them into a single force.  The MEU brings what it needs to sustain itself from the sea  for the rapid accomplishment of the mission or to pave the way for follow on forces.<br>
The size and composition of the MEU make it well suited for amphibious operations; security operations; noncombatant evacuation of civilians threatened by, or suffering from, violence; special operations; and service as mobile training teams.  The MEU is an expeditionary force in nature, able to operate in foreign lands without U. S. bases and facilities.  It is Naval in character, useful in conventional operations in the air and ashore, and is able to operate with U.S. fleets around the world.  The MEU’s combined arms team bears substantial force and is capable of a high degree of tactical mobility while delivering significant, sustained firepower within an objective area.<br>
Prior to deployment each MEU is thoroughly trained in 21 unique capabilities during a fast paced six month work up cycle that includes 3-4 at sea training periods. These missions, which range from  humanitarian assistance to amphibious assaults, include:
<ul>
<li>Amphibious raids
<li>Limited Objective Attacks
<li>Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) 
<li>Show of Force Operations
<li>Reinforcement Operations
<li>Security Operations
<li>Mobile Training Teams
<li>Civic Action Operations
<li>Military Tactical Deception Operations
<li>Fire Support Control
<li>Counterintelligence Operations
<li>Initial Terminal Guidance
<li>Signal Intelligence/Electronic Warfare Operations 
<li>(SIGINT)
<li>Tactical Recovery of Aircraft, Equipment, Personnel 
<li>(TRAP)
<li>Recovery Operations
<li>Specialized Demolition Operations
<li>Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT)
<li>In extremis Hostage Recovery (IHR)
<li>Airfield Seizure
<li>Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO)
<li>Gas and Oil Platform (GOPLAT) Operations
</ul>
The MEU is not a special operations force by definition, nor does the Marine Corps provide forces with the primary mission of special operations.   MEU’s are forward deployed in -- hot spots -- around the world, and must be able to perform many types of missions in addition to conventional military warfighting.  The MEU, by enhanced training, achieves the capability to accomplish selective maritime special operations.  MEU’s with these qualifications are capable of quick reaction  -- rapidly assembling required forces to accomplish missions, using intelligence-based operational decision making, and acting as a rapid response force.<br>
An enhancement of individual and unit capabilities is reflected by the designation Special Operations Capable (SOC).<br>

<center><h2>History of the 11th MEU</h2></center>
The 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) was originally designated the 17th Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU), formed at Camp Pendleton, California on April 13, 1979.<br>
The MAU was created to plan and participate in large-scale amphibious training exercises.  In these early days, the unit also fulfilled requirements for a MAU to respond to contingencies, but was activated and deactivated based largely upon scheduled amphibious landing exercises directed by the Commander, Third Fleet.  During this time, the billet of MAU Commanding Officer alternated between Regimental and Aircraft Group Commanders who filled the billet in six month increments as a secondary duty during their tenure in command.<br>
In 1983 the Marine Corps directed a change that resulted in the first redesignation of the 17th MAU.  The decision was made to "source" the continuously deployed Western Pacific (WESTPAC) MAUs from I Marine Amphibious Force units in Southern California, vice from the 1st Marine Brigade in Hawaii.  As a consequence of this decision, and to maintain continuity and momentum, the 17th MAU was redesignated the 11th MAU on July 20, 1984.<br>
A second redesignation took place February 5, 1988 when the Marine Corps more clearly defined the multiple capabilities of its Marine Air-Ground Task Forces.  "Amphibious" was changed to "Expeditionary," and the unit was given its current designation -- the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit.
While the units designation changed, the mission of the 11th MEU has remained largely unchanged.  The MEU is an expeditionary intervention force with the ability to move quickly on short notice, to wherever needed to accomplish conventional or special operations.  The strength of the MEU (Special Operations Capable) resides in the inherent combined arms capability while operating from amphibious shipping, forward deployed.
In order to accomplish this mission, the MEU’s assets are directed at maintaining the required combat readiness, while simultaneously fulfilling worldwide training and contingency commitments.<br>
The 11th MEU has participated in numerous training exercises/operations from the coast of California to the shores of Somalia, and far inland to Bujumbura, Burundi in Central Africa.  Most recently they participated in Operations Restore/Continue Hope and Quick Draw in Mogadishu, Somalia, and Operation Distant Runner in Burundi.<br>
The 11th MEU has completed nine major deployments to the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Arabian Gulf. <br>
Unit awards include the Meritorious Unit Commendation for participation in Exercise Kernel Potlach 87-1, the National Defense Service Medal and Southwest Asia Service Medal with three stars awarded for participation in Operations Desert Shield/Storm, the Joint Meritorious Unit Award for participation in Joint Task Force Provide Relief, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and Meritorious Unit Commendation for participation in Operations Restore/Continue Hope and the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal for Operation Distant Runner.<br>
Major elements for this deployment are Battalion Landing Team 3rd  Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron-166 (Rein.), and MEU Service Support Group-11.<br>

<h1>Squad Automatic Weapon</h1>
The M-249 SAW is an individually portable, gas-operated, magazine or disintegrating metallic link-belt fed, light machine gun with a quick change barrel feature that replaced the M-16 as the automatic rifle in the fire team, forming the basis of firepower for the fire team.<br>
The gunner has the option of using the linked ammunition from a pre-loaded 200-round plastic box magazine or the 30-round M-16 magazine.  The gunner’s basic load is 600 rounds of linked ammunition.<br>
The SAW increases the firepower of Marine infantry units, with a capability of engaging point targets as far as 800 meters, firing the improved, NATO standard 5.56mm cartridge.<br>

<h1>M-60E3 Machine Gun</h1>
The M-60E3 machine gun is a 7.62 mm, lightweight, air-cooled, disintegrating metallic link-belt fed, portable or tripod mounted machine gun designed for ground operations.  It is gas operated with fixed head space and timing which permits rapid changing of barrels.<br>
Slightly different from its "parent," the M-60, it has a receiver- attached bipod which easily deploys for stability.  It has an ambidextrous safety mechanism, universal sling attachments, a carrying handle on the barrel, and a simplified gas system.<br>
The M60-E3 was fielded with the intention to reduce the load carried by the gunner.  However, the reduction in weight resulted in firing limitations and a loss of reliability.<br>
Consequently, the Marine Corps began replacing this  weapon with the M-240G during Fiscal Year 1995.  The 11th MEU has a handful in its inventory.<br>

<h1>M-240G Machine Gun</h1>
The M-240G Machine Gun is the ground version of the M-240 which is mounted on tanks and light armored vehicles.  It is a medium machine gun, 7.62 (.30 caliber) fired from ground position.  The M-240G is modified for ground use by installation of a buttstock and bipod, front and rear sights and a flash suppressor.<br>
The rate of fire for the M-240G may be controlled by three different regulator settings for single rounds, short bursts or sustained fire.<br>
The durability of the M-240G results in superior reliability and maintainability over the M-60 machine gun, currently being replaced by the M-240G.<br>

<h1>Stinger Missile System</h1>
The primary function of the Stinger Weapons System is to provide close-in, surface-to-air weapons fire for the defense of forward combat areas, vital areas, and installations against low altitude air attacks.<br>
The Stinger is a man portable, shoulder-fired guided missile system which enables a Marine to effectively engage low-altitude jet, propeller driven and helicopter aircraft.  Developed by the United States Army Missile Command, the Stinger was the successor to the Redeye Weapon System.<br>
The Stinger is a "fire-and-forget" weapon employing a passive infrared seeker and proportional navigation system.  This system is also designed for the threat beyond the 1990s, with an all-aspect engagement capability, and IFF (Identification-Friend-or-Foe), improved range and maneuverability, and significant countermeasures immunity.<br>
The missile, packed within its disposable launch tube, is delivered as a certified round, requiring no field testing or direct support maintenance.  A separable, reusable gripstock is attached to the round prior to use and may be used again.<br>

<h1>TOW Missile</h1>
The Tube Launched, Optically Tracked, Wire-Guided (TOW) Weapon System is an antiarmor missile used to engage and destroy enemy vehicles, primarily tanks.  The secondary mission for the TOW system  is to destroy other point targets such as non-armored vehicles, crew-served weapons and launchers.<br>
The TOW system can track targets in poor visibility and all weather conditions.  Once the missile is fired, the gunner need only keep his cross-hairs on the target.  Guidance of the missile to its target is controlled by a thin wire.  A computer in the launcher corrects any deviation from the aim point on the target and sends corrections to the missile via wires that deploy in flight.<br>
The system is composed of a reusable launcher, a missile guidance set and sight system.  The system can be mounted on a tripod, Light Armored Vehicle, or High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).<br>

<h1>Light Armored Vehicle</h1>
The primary function of the Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) is to provide strategic mobility to reach and engage the threat;  tactical mobility for effective use of firepower;  firepower to defeat soft and armored targets; and battle field survivability to carry out combat missions.<br>
There are six variants of the LAV.  They include:
<ul>
<li>LAV-25;
<li>LAV-C2 (Command and Control);
<li>LAV-AT (Antitank);
<li>LAV-M (Mortar);
<li>LAV-L (Logistics);
<li>and the LAV-R (Recovery).
</ul>
The LAV is an all-terrain, all-weather vehicle with night capabilities.  It is air transportable via KC-130, C-141, and C-5 aircraft, and most importantly to the MEU, CH-53E helicopters.  When combat loaded there are 210 ready rounds and 420 stowed rounds of 25mm ammunition as well as 400 ready rounds and 1,200 stowed rounds of 7.62mm.  There are eight ready rounds and eight stowed rounds  of smoke grenades.  A supplementary M-240G machine gun can be pintle-mounted at the commander’s station in the turret.
The LAV is fully amphibious with a maximum of three minutes preparation.

<h1>Assault Amphibious Vehicle</h1>
The Marine Corps AAV7A1 family of assault amphibious vehicles carry the surface assault infantry elements of the landing force and their equipment from amphibious ships to inland objectives.  Once ashore AAV7A1 vehicles support maneuver warfare and perform combat support and combat service support  missions as appropriate.<br>
<br>
There are three AAV variants:
<ul>
<li>	AAVP7A1  —  This is the baseline variant and the primary means of providing armored protected mobility to the Ground Combat Element.  Following closely behind tank units, the AAVP7A1 provides suppressive fires against enemy infantry and lightly armored vehicles.  The AAVP7A1 carries infantry forward to maintain an attack’s momentum; they dismount and remount as the tactical situation requires. 
<li>AAVC7A1  —  This vehicle is used as a mobile command post for infantry regiment and battalion commanders during ship-to-shore movement and operations ashore.
<li>AAVR7A1 —  This version provides recovery and field maintenance support for the AAV7A1 family during operations ashore.
</ul>

<h1>Landing Craft Air Cushion</h1>
The mission of the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) is to land heavy vehicles, equipment, personnel, and cargo in an amphibious assault.  The LCAC is a new generation of amphibious assault landing craft.  Combining the heavy lift capability of the surface assault with high speeds of helicopter-borne assault, the LCAC adds a new dimension to the capabilities of amphibious forces.<br>
Capable of traveling over land and water, the LCAC exposes 70 percent of the world’s littoral to amphibious operations.  At over-the-horizon distances of 12 to 100 nautical miles, the LCAC offers Navy and Marine Corps planners another method for attaining surprise when conducting amphibious operations.  Additional flexibility is provided by the LCAC’s ability to operate independent of tides and hydrographic constraints.  Weather can effect LCAC operations, but it is less of a factor than for other ship-to-shore delivery means.<br>
The 11th MEU (SOC) is augmented with five LCACs from Camp Pendleton, Calif.<br>

<h1>KC-130 Hercules</h1>
The KC-130 Hercules, a four-engine turboprop aircraft, is the cargo/transport workhorse of the military services.  Capable of landing and taking off from short, rough dirt runways, it is a people and cargo hauler, and used in a wide variety of other roles such as gunships, weather watchers, tankers, firefighters and aerial ambulances.  There are more than 40 versions of the Hercules, and it is used by more than 50 nations.<br>
Four decades have elapsed since the Air Force's Tactical Air Command issued its original design specification, yet the remarkable C-130 remains in production.  Deliveries of the C-130A began in December 1956 and the first B models came on board in April 1959.  In 1993 Congress authorized the purchase of several H models to replace the aging models still in the inventory.<br>

Commander Campbell Darby was raised on his parents property in North Western New South Wales. He attended Quirindi High School, before joining the Royal Australian Naval College, at Jervis Bay in 1973 Initial training was undertaken in a variety of ships and culminated in the award of a Bridge Watchkeeping Certificate in HMAS VAMPIRE in 1976. As a junior officer he undertook duties as the Executive Officer of the Papua New Guinea Landing Craft PNGS BUNA, and the Assistant Principal Warfare Officer (PWO) and Master Gunner of HMAS VAMPIRE.<br>
Promoted to Lieutenant in 1978 he was posted to the Naval College in 1979 as a Divisional Officer, before being selected for PWO training in the UK. PWO training was successfully completed in 1981 before undertaking an exchange posting with the Royal Navy on HM Ships RHYL and BERWICK in 1982/83.  This period was a career highlight involving many and varied deployments and being very rewarding professionally.  Returning to Australia, he was posted as the Operations Officer and ASW Officer of HMAS BRISBANE in early 1984.  Accompanied by his family, the newly promoted LCDR Darby was posted back to the UK in mid-1985 to teach prospective PWOs at the Royal Navy's School of Maritime Operations. HMS DRY AD.<br>

During this period he was also selected for promotion to Commander.<br>
Commander Darby was posted to the Canberra area in 1991 and completed a study into the RAN's Mine Warfare Forces before taking up the position of Assistant Director of Naval Officers' Posting responsible for career management of all officers of Lieutenant Commander rank and below.  This was followed in 1994 by a period of 12 months in the Directorate of Force Development working principally in the area of Naval Infrastructure development. Selection for major ship command has been undoubtedly the major career highlight and Commander Darby assumed command of HMAS SYDNEY on 13 July 1995.<br>
Commander Darby was married in 1978.  His wife Shani currently lives and works in Canberra with their two daughters Sarah (aged 13) and Jonanna (aged 11).

USS INDEPENDENCE (CV 62) - Crest
</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<img src="crest.jpg"></a><br>
<h1>The Command Crest</h1></center><br>


<p> 	The crest consists of an image of the famous "Liberty Bell" over a red background, a banner bearing the name of the ship and the 13 stars representing the United States' original 13 colonies emblazoned on a blue background, surrounded by a golden rope. </p>

<p> The Liberty Bell is a beloved symbol of freedom to Americans everywhere.  The bell's production was commissioned in 1751 by the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly to hang in what would later be named Independence Hall in Philadelphia. It was made in London where it cracked for the first time during testing, and was recast twice before it was delivered and placed in the hall in June of 1753. </p>

<p> The bell was rung July 8, 1777, to celebrate the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence. Shortly after, the bell was removed and hidden when British troops moved in and occupied Philadelphia. </p>

<p> After the Revolutionary War, the bell was returned to Independence Hall and tolled for the final time in 1846 in celebration of George Washington's 114th birthday.  At that time it suffered the famous irreparable crack.  The bell now rests in a pavilion near Independence Hall and bears the inscription, "Proclaim liberty throughout all the land to the inhabitants thereof." </p>

<p> For more than 37 years, USS INDEPENDENCE (CV 62), the fifth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name, has proudly worn the Liberty Bell on her crest, taking it to every corner of the world. </p>

<h2><center>USS NEW ORLEANS<BR>Amphibious Readiness Group<BR>Ends Deployment</center></h2>
<title>NEW ORLEANS ARG Ends Deployment</title>
</center>
<hr>
The NEW ORLEANS amphibious ready group (ARG) returned to
San Diego December 22, 1995 after a highly successful six month western Pacific deployment. &nbsp; While deployed the ARG participated in numerous exercises to include Infinite Moonlight 95 in Jordan, Eager Mace 96-1 in Kuwait, and neon falcon in the gulf. &nbsp; Additionally the Sailors and Marines of the ARG hosted two very successful receptions, entertained numerous distinguished visitors and conducted more than 20 community relations projects in four countries.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first stop for the NEW ORLEANS ARG, after its 23 June departure from San Diego, was Okinawa, Japan. &nbsp; The ships arrived July 11 for four days of sustainment training to exercise the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps team's ability to project combat power ashore.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Okinawa operations, Vice Admiral Archie Clemins, Commander, U.S. Seventh Fleet, and Rear Admiral W. F. Doran, Commander Amphibious Group ONE, visited the NEW ORLEANS ARG. &nbsp; The July 13 visit allowed the admirals to talk with Sailors and Marines and tour all four ships.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Okinawa the ships headed for Hong Kong then went on to a five day maintenance and training availability in Singapore. &nbsp; In Hong Kong, members of the ARG relaxed, shopped and took advantage of tours. &nbsp; On 26 July the ships arrived in Singapore where the 11th MEU(SOC), Naval Special Warfare Task Unit and Explosive Ordnance Disposal Detachment conducted a variety of individual and unit training at several sites throughout Singapore and conducted a community relations project.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NEW ORLEANS ARG departed Singapore July 31 for its first stop in the Fifth Fleet area of responsibility; Aqaba: Jordan. &nbsp; The four ships arrived in the seaport city August 15 to conduct exercise Infinite Moonlight 95 which lasted until August 30.
The ships had not even moored before the off-load of Marines and equipment began. &nbsp; Helicopters from Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron (HMM)-164 began to off-load Marines and equipment to the Al Qatranah Training Area 194 miles away from Aqaba. &nbsp; Once pier side, the ships continued the off-load of the 11th MEU(SOC) entirely by ships' cranes in less than 21 hours.
Approximately 1,600 leathernecks made the trek inland where they endured temperatures in excess of 100 degrees during 10 days of training. &nbsp; While ashore the Marines interacted with Jordanian soldiers both professionally and socially. &nbsp; The 11th MEU(SOC) Marines established 14 live-fire ranges and conducted 113 separate live fire events. &nbsp; The field operations wrapped up with a combined U.S.-Jordanian brigade level live-fire exercise.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the port, the ships hosted tours and numerous distinguished visitors. &nbsp; A reception, co-hosted by the Deputy Chief of Mission, Mr. Robert Beecroft and Vice Admiral Scott Redd, Commander U.S. Naval Forces Central Command and Commander Fifth Fleet, was held on the flight deck of USS NEW ORLEANS on August 22. &nbsp; Guests included Jordanian government officials, community leaders and businessmen as well as several foreign diplomats and attaches.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was something for everyone in Aqaba. &nbsp; Whether it was learning to say "Thank You" in Arabic or sampling the local cuisine, NEW ORLEANS ARG Sailors and Marines formed a bond of trust, cooperation and friendship with their Jordanian hosts. &nbsp; The Jordanian people expressed their best wishes for a safe journey and their hope for a future visit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ARG set sail for its next stop Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.). &nbsp; The ships arrived September 7 and stayed until the morning of September 19. &nbsp; This port visit was the first opportunity for the ARG to conduct major maintenance since it
Departed San Diego. &nbsp; Sailors and Marines worked hard to repair equipment and conduct preventive maintenance, but it was not all work. &nbsp; Marines and Sailors continued to build positive Arab-American relations through the completion of 10 community relations projects.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completion of all maintenance, the NEW ORLEANS ARG departed Jebel Ali and headed towards Kuwait city, Kuwait, to conduct exercise Eager Mace 96-1, an interoperability exercise between U.S. forces and the Kuwaiti military. &nbsp; The ARG arrived September 21 and after completion of the off-load of embarked Marines headed back to sea for realistic underway training in the ever volatal Arabian Gulf.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Marines conducted exercise Eager Mace 96-1 ashore, the ships of the NEW ORLEANS ARG participated in exercise Reliant Gorilla which was designed by Amphibious Squadron SEVEN, with Carrier Group FIVE staff support, to develop the blueprint for ARG/Carrier Battle Group (CVBG) interoperability. &nbsp; This exercise was the first of its kind in the Arabian Gulf and will form the basis for future Fifth Fleet ARG/CVBG operations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During exercise Eager Mace, tethered KC-130 aircraft from Marine Fixed Wing Aerial Refueling Squadron (VMGR)-352 conducted the first in flight refueling of Kuwaiti F/A-18's. &nbsp; During this 19 day exercise, the 11th MEU(SOC) conducted joint and combined training exercises which demonstrated the abilities and professionalism of a forward deployed force. &nbsp; As Eager Mace 96-1 came to an end, the Marines and Sailors of the 11th MEU(SOC) were visited by Brigadier General E. R. Langston, Deputy Commanding General 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, who stated, "You really shined in the desert and did a superb job of demonstrating the MEU's capabilities. &nbsp; Job well done". &nbsp; At the completion of the exercise the NEW ORLEANS ARG returned to Kuwait to embark the 11th MEU(SOC).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the NEW ORLEANS ARG Naval Special Warfare Task Unit (NSWTU) and Marine forces participated in Exercise Neon Falcon October 9-15. &nbsp; This exercise is part of a series of exercises which helped test and develop local gulf defense capabilities. &nbsp; The highlight of the exercise, and a first in the Arabian Gulf, was pier side and at sea dry deck shelter launch and recovery training on board a fleet subMarine by 11th MEU(SOC)'s Force Reconnaissance Platoon and Amphibious Squadron SEVEN's NSWTU.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period 13-23 October, each ARG ship had the opportunity to moor in Bahrain for a brief port visit. &nbsp; Each ship was visited by the Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton on either 19 or 20 October. &nbsp; During the visit, the Secretary received a brief tour, conducted an awards ceremony and fielded a variety of questions from Sailors and Marines. &nbsp; He said the Sailors and Marines should take pride in their mission accomplishments, the traditions they uphold and in the country's gratitude for the sacrifices they and their families make.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the evening of October 19, a reception was held on board the uss NEW ORLEANS to honor the secretary. &nbsp; The reception's co-hosts were the U.S. ambassador to bahrain, the honorable david m. Ransom, and commander Fifth Fleet, vadm redd. &nbsp; Over 300 bahraini government, military, business and community leaders as well as several foreign diplomats and attaches attended the reception. &nbsp; Guests received a short tour to include a static display of embarked helicopters. &nbsp; The
Evening concluded with brief remarks by vice admiral redd and the secretary of the Navy, after which the dignitaries participated in a cake cutting ceremony. &nbsp; Also, while in bahrain mgen frank libutti, commanding general 1st Marine division, visited the ARG, toured each ship and visited with Marines. &nbsp; During his stay he promoted and presented awards to a number of Marines.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After departure from Bahrain, the NEW ORLEANS ARG put to sea and participated in Exercise Reliant Gorilla October 25-27. &nbsp; The purpose of this exercise was to integrate the ARG and middle east force combatants into a cohesive maritime superiority force during the absence of a carrier battle group and to enhance joint operations in the Arabian Gulf. &nbsp; Middle east based Air Force A-10 aircraft were used in war at sea strikes coordinated by Navy air controllers. &nbsp; The exercise concluded with the takedown of a simulated sanctions violator (Maritime Prepositioning Squadron 2 supplied motor vessel William Baugh for the target ship) by a combined Navy/Marine Maritime Special Purpose Force. &nbsp;Another first, this exercise was extremely successful and the NEW ORLEANS ARG, along with her middle east force cruiser destroyer counterparts, performed flawlessly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NEW ORLEANS ARG departed the Fifth Fleet area of Responsibility November 10 with a sense of pride and accomplishment. &nbsp;Each sailor and Marine individually, and as a team, took comfort in the knowledge that they served their country, improved Arab-American relations, maintained forward presence and demonstrated America's commitment to this vital region.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completion of three months of Middle East/Arabian  Gulf operations, the ARG began its return transit home via western Australia.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 20, Sailors and Marines manned the rails in their whites, as the NEW ORLEANS ARG entered the ports of Fremantle and Bunbury, Australia, for a five day port visit. &nbsp; The USS NEW ORLEANS (LPH-11), USS JUNEAU (LPD-10) and USS COMSTOCK (LSD-45) visited the city of Fremantle and the USS MOUNT VERNON (LSD-39) visited the city of Bunbury.
While in port, Sailors and Marines of the NEW ORLEANS ARG took tours, shopped for last minute Christmas presents and relaxed. &nbsp; Tours ranged from wine tasting to an adventure day tour in the famous Australian outback. &nbsp; Others took time to go to the beach, sunbathe and catch up on letter writing and reading. &nbsp; Additionally, the Navy and Marine Corps team volunteered their time for seven community relations projects. &nbsp; Further, the Sailors and Marines proudly displayed their ships and embarked equipment to the citizens of Australia for more than 6,000 visitors who toured some of America's finest warships.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States Thanksgiving Day is traditionally spent with one's family. &nbsp; For the NEW ORLEANS ARG, this day saw Sailors and Marines opening up their ships and their hearts to celebrate this special day with Australia's less fortunate youth. &nbsp; While USS JUNEAU and USS COMSTOCK hosted nearly 100 disadvantaged children to a traditional american thanksgiving dinner, USS NEW ORLEANS provided a special tour and treats to 150 physically challenged children. &nbsp;Captain Donald K. Bullard, Commanding Officer USS NEW ORLEANS and Colonel Robert B. Blose, Jr., Commanding Officer 11th MEU(SOC) personally hosted the children on their tour of USS NEW ORLEANS.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Australian port visit offered an excellent opportunity for the Sailors and Marines to relax, have fun and give something of themselves. &nbsp; The NEW ORLEANS ARG bid a fond farewell to their wonderful and gracious Australian hosts November 25.
After Australia the NEW ORLEANS ARG stopped for a one day visit to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, to off-load Marine equipment, brief the Pacific Fleet Commander and Marine Forces Pacific Commander and pick up tigers. &nbsp; Tigers are friends and family members of Sailors and Marines who have the opportunity to share life at sea with their sponsor. &nbsp; During the transit to San Diego, the tigers witnessed ARG/MEU capabilities to include an air show by embarked helicopters and vip tours of the ships, which included embarked Marine equipment. &nbsp;Many of them completed an aggressive training program to earn honorary crew member status.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early on 21 December the NEW ORLEANS ARG arrived off the coast of California and off-loaded the 11th MEU(SOC). &nbsp; With loved ones eagerly awaiting their arrival at sites throughout southern California, members of HMM-164, ACU FIVE, MSSG-11, Battalion Landing Team 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment (BLT 2/1), and helicopter Combat Support Squadron ELEVEN (HC-11) debarked ARG ships by land and sea.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With friends and family on the piers, the Sailors and Marines of the NEW ORLEANS ARG returned to San Diego with a tremendous sense of pride in all their professional and personal  accomplishments.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NEW ORLEANS ARG is commanded by captain r. B. Ormsbee, Commander Amphibious Squadron SEVEN, and is composed of over 4,000 Sailors and Marines.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 11th MEU(SOC) is commanded by Colonel Robert B. Blose, Jr. Units of the 11th MEU(SOC) include BLT 2/1, HMM-164 (REIN) and MSSG-11. &nbsp;  U.S. Navy support elements include detachments from Assault Craft Units ONE and FIVE, Beach Master Unit ONE, Tactical Air Control Squadron ELEVEN, Navy Special Warfare Command, Fleet Information Warfare Center Det, Helicopter Combat Support Squadron ELEVEN and Mobile Medical Augmentation Readiness Team FIVE.<br>

<p>
Welcome to "<a href="/innovate/innovate_form.htm">INNOVATE</a>"!!  We at CINCPACFLT have many new challenges to meet.  
We are interested in finding new ways for our Navy to meet these challenges 
without sacrificing either our operational effectiveness or the quality of 
life of our people.  We need some new ideas in PACFLT.  There are over 
140,000 officers and sailors in the Pacific and a significant number of 
civilians as well.  We are sure that there are a large number of ideas, big
and small, from this talented group of professionals that can point us new 
ways for us to do our job more effectively and more affordably.  We are asking
you to help get these ideas via the "<a href="/innovate/innovate_form.htm">INNOVATE</a>" Program.
<p>
"<a href="/innovate/innovate_form.htm">INNOVATE</a>" is focusing on ideas that address three primary questions:  
(1)  What are we doing now that we could be doing better or more affordably?
(2)  What are we doing now that we should not be doing?
(3)  What are we not doing now that we should be doing?
<p>
"<a href="/innovate/innovate_form.htm">INNOVATE</a>" does not replace any existing hotlines, request masts EEO programs, 
etc.  It is not intended as a complaint forum.  It is intended as a different
mechanism to surface and evaluate different approaches to issues and problems
without the more formal, and lengthy structure of point papers and staffing.  Effective use of "<a href="/innovate/innovate_form.htm">INNOVATE</a>" can provide a unique opportunity to improve the quality of CINCPACFLT.  We encourage and welcome your participation.

<html>SEC Proposes Technical Amendments To Rules Regulating Money Market
Funds</title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/tpg/tax/mony/monyhead.gif"  alt="Money Manager's Compliance Guide"></center>
<hr>
<h2>SEC Proposes Technical Amendments To Rules Regulating Money Market
Funds</h2><P>
<body>
The Securities and Exchange Commission Dec. 18, 1996, proposed technical

amendments to rules and forms governing the operation of money market funds

under the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act) and the Investment Company Act of

1940 (1940 Act) (61 FR 66621).<p>

The proposal revises the regulation of money market funds under Rule 2a-7 of the

1940 Act, advertising rules for money market funds under Rule 482 of the 1933

Act, and Forms N-1A, N-3 and N-4. In addition, the proposal makes conforming

revisions to Rules 2a41-1, 12d3-1 and 31a-1 under the 1940 Act.<p>

<h3>Revisions to Rule 2a-7<p></h3>

In March 1996, SEC adopted final amendments, known as the March amendments, to

Rule 2a-7 (61 FR 13956, March 28, 1996). The amendments tightened the

risk-limiting conditions on tax-exempt money market funds and addressed the

treatment under Rule 2a-7 of certain instruments, such as asset-backed

securities (ABSs). Industry participants immediately raised concerns about the

complexity of the amendments and the terminology used in the rule, which in many

cases did not reflect common market usage.<p>

In response to concerns, SEC released an interpretive letter containing

questions  and answers from the commission staff. Because of the rule's

complexity and the need to read the rule in conjunction with the interpretive

letter, SEC later suspended the effective date of Rule 2a-7 until technical

amendments were developed (for information, see "Rule 2a-7 Changes on Hold

Pending Corrections," October 1996 Bulletin, p. 1).<p>

In addition to making technical corrections, the proposed amendments to Rule

2a-7 revise terminology used in the rule to reflect common market usage and

codify positions taken by SEC staff in the interpretive letter. The proposed

amendments also modify several of the March amendments so that the treatment

accorded instruments such as guarantees in the rule more closely reflects the

treatment accorded to those instruments by the financial markets, SEC said.<p>

One significant change in the proposed amendments is the replacement of

references to "puts" and "unconditional puts" with a new term "guarantee." The

change was proposed to address industry confusion regarding the types of

unconditional credit support that may be used to comply with the rule's credit

quality requirements. Designed to unconditionally support the credit of the

security's issuer, guarantees include letters of credit, financial guaranty

(bond) insurance and unconditional demand features, SEC said.<p>

Proposed amendments also permit funds to rely solely on the credit quality of

the issuer of a guarantee in determining the credit quality of the security, as

long as the guarantee is rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating

organization (NRSRO) and the rule's notification requirement is satisfied. Funds

also would be exempt from issuer diversification standards for securities

subject to unconditional guarantees from a non-controlled person, as defined in

the proposal.<p>

The rule provides for a three-day safe harbor, meaning a taxable or national

tax-exempt fund may invest up to 25 percent of its total assets in the

first-tier securities of a single issuer for up to three business days. The

proposal restores unintentionally omitted language stating that a fund may not

make more than one investment during the three-day period, SEC said.<p>

The commission also proposed to modify the rating requirement for ABSs and

synthetic securities to exempt from the rating requirement any ABS or synthetic

security substantially all of whose assets consist of obligations from one or

more municipal issuers. Revisions to Rule 2a-7 clarify that an ABS subject to a

guarantee would itself not be required to be rated by an NRSRO.<p>

<h3>Advertising Rule Revisions<p></h3>

The amendments proposed to Rule 482 would clarify the formula used by money

market funds to calculate yield. To resolve industry questions about the

calculation of yield, SEC proposed to limit the income included in the yield to

investment income. In addition, SEC proposed to amend Forms N-1A, N-3 and N-4 to

reflect the change in yield calculation.<p>

The commission also proposed amendments to Rule 482 under the 1933 Act and Rule

34b-1 under the 1940 Act that would require the total return used in

advertisements and sales literature to cover a period of at least one year. In

addition, SEC proposed requiring that total return quotations in advertisements

and sales literature be accompanied by a current yield quotation that is

computed in accordance with applicable rules and set forth with equal

prominence. The changes are designed to prevent investors from being misled by

the presentation of a money market fund's short-term total return in lieu of its

yield, SEC said.<p>

SEC also solicited comments on appropriate methods of disclosing non-investment

income and an appropriate compliance date for the technical amendments. Comments

on the proposed technical amendments are due by Jan. 24. For more information,

contact Marjorie Riegel, senior counsel for the Office of General Counsel in

SEC's Division of Investment Management, at (202) 942-0660.

<h2>USDA Offers Prior Labeling Approval Q&amp;A</h2>
<P>
In conjunction with the Food Labeling Division, the Processing Operations Staff (POS) compiled its first Inspection Operations list of questions and answers and information on the new prior labeling rule. POS issued the list of questions and answers (printed below) to Inspection Operations Supervisory Personnel for use during work unit meetings or when providing guidance and clarification to field personnel on the new rule and FSIS Directive 7221.1, Prior Labeling Approval.
</P>

<P>
PRIOR LABELING APPROVAL QUESTION AND ANSWER SET #1
</P>

<P>
<B>1. Q. When the new prior labeling rule becomes effective on July 1, 1996, are all labeling files to be returned to establishments, even those associated with Partial Quality Control (PQC) programs or for export to specific countries only?</B>
</P>

<P>
A. Yes. On July 1, 1996, inspectors should return all copies of labels and label approval transmittals and any other labeling records from the FSIS labeling file to plant management. It is the responsibility of plant management to maintain copies of labels and all supporting documentation i.e., formulations and processing procedures, for all labels in accordance with 9 CFR 317.4, 317.5, 381.132, and 381.133, including those associated with PQCs or for export only. 
</P>

<P>
<B>2.  Q.  If inspectors no longer have labeling files, what information should they use to perform the formulation and similar tasks as scheduled by Process 06 of PBIS?</B>
</P>

<P>
A. Inspectors should continue to perform Process 06 tasks in the same manner as prior to July 1, 1996. In accordance with 318.6 of the Meat Regulations and 381.180 of the Poultry Regulations, establishments still must provide inspectors with accurate formulation and product composition information upon request. However, there is no specific form or format required. Nonetheless, the information must be complete enough for inspectors to verify plants' compliance with any applicable requirements through the performance of Process 06 tasks. 
</P>

<P>
<B>3.  Q. Should inspectors have plants provide them with copies of product formulations for their files? </B>
</P>

<P>
A. No. Product formulations are proprietary information which belongs to establishments and should not be in inspectors' files or in the possession of an inspector except when [inspectors} are performing inspection tasks related to those formulations. 
</P>

<P>
<B>4. Q. Since most labeling can now be used without prior Agency approval, do inspectors now need to "approve" establishments' product formulations prior to them producing the product?</B>
</P>

<P>
A. No, inspectors will not be providing establishments with prior approval of their formulations. However, when performing processing inspection through PBIS Process 06, inspectors will verify if product formulations and compositions are in compliance with any applicable regulations or product standards, and that ingredients are accurately listed on the finished product label in order of descending predominance. 
</P>

<P>
<B>5. Q. It has been stated that under the new rule, establishments can transfer labels between plants without direct Agency involvement but with "proper" documentation. Is this true, and if so, what is proper documentation?</B>
</P>

<P>
A. Under the new prior labeling rule, establishments are responsible for transferring labels, wrappers, or containers bearing the official mark (with or without establishment numbers) between official establishments. In fact, FSIS Directive 7221.1, 6/20/96, cancels FSIS Directive 7231.3, "Control and Use of Labels." The FLD [Food Labeling Division] will no longer review and approve labels for transfer. However, the transfer of labels and their subsequent use must be properly documented by establishments, and said documentation must be available to FSIS inspection personnel. In this case, "proper documentation" includes all of the information formerly documented by inspectors on FSIS Form 7227-1, "Permit to Ship Meat or Poultry Labels Between Official Establishments," that is, names and addresses of shipping and receiving plants, date, quantity of labels shipped, product name, restrictions if any, and signature of responsible plant officials. There is, however, no official form or format for the information, and inspectors would not need to grant prior approval, file copies of the paperwork, or sign the plants' documentation.
</P>

<P>
Establishments will still need to maintain inventory control of transferred labels and some type of identification or coding to distinguish labeled products as to the establishment of origin in the event of a recall.
</P>

<P>
<B>6. Q. After July 1, 1996, if a plant has labels which were approved by FLD or an IIC [Inspector In Charge] previously, do inspectors or plants need to request official rescindment from FLD?</B>
</P>

<P>
A. No. There is no need to rescind previously approved labels; the regulatory requirement to rescind obsolete labels has been eliminated. It is up to plants to purge their own files of obsolete labels if and when they choose to do so. FLD's Label Audit System will request samples of labels which are in active use by plants.
</P>

<P>
<B>7. Q. If an establishment submits a label to FLD which can be approved generically, will FLD review and  approve it?</B>
</P>

<P>
A. FLD generally will not review and approve labeling which is eligible for generic approval. However, FLD will allow establishments to voluntarily submit for review and approval sketch labeling for standardized products (e.g., frankfurters or chicken croquettes) that are listed in the regulations or the [FSIS] <I>Standards and Labeling Policy Book</I>. FLD will not review and approve standardized single- ingredient products, e.g., ground beef.
</P>

<P>
<B>8.  Q.  While performing the new PBIS Task 07B01a2, should inspectors document deficiencies if plants are not meeting the Labeling Regulations; for example, if labels are not approved as required, are not technically accurate, or are missing mandatory features? </B>
</P>

<P>
A. The revised PBIS Task 07B01a2 is a two-step process. Step 1: Inspectors select finished product labels to verify that they contain the mandatory label features and that they accurately represent the finished product. If any of the applicable mandatory labeling features are missing from the label, or the label does not accurately reflect the finished product, inspectors should record a major deficiency, retain the product, and require plants to take corrective and preventive actions. 
</P>

<P>
Step 2: The labels are then to be sent to FLD for audit. The FLD Label Audit System will determine if plants have appropriately approved their labels and if the labels are technically accurate. If the FLD Label Audit System identifies inappropriately approved or inaccurate labels, then FLD will initiate corrective actions directly with the establishment. Inspection personnel will be notified of any actions to be taken.
</P>

<P>
<B>9. Q. When performing new PBIS Task 07B01a2, what is meant by the term "accurately reflects finished product"?</B>
</P>

<P>
A. It is not the Agency's intention for inspectors to be in-plant label reviewers. However, inspectors should observe the label(s) selected for audit and the product(s) to which it is applied to verify compliance with general labeling requirements. Inspectors should determine if the correct label is being placed on the finished product. For example, if a product is labeled "Beef Franks," the meat component of the finished product must be beef and not any other species. Or, if a product is labeled "Pepperoni Pizza," it must contain pepperoni. If these general labeling requirements are not met, inspectors should follow FSIS Directive 7221.1, 6/20/96.
</P>

<P>
The Agency will further review labels to determine their technical accuracy through the FLD Label Audit System. For example, determining appropriate product names and which standards apply, correct letter size and height, etc., are the purview of FLD. If inspectors have questions on labels in these regards, they should not retain product but may forward the label to FLD for further review and any follow-up actions.
</P>

<P>
<B>10. Q.  Do labels bearing nutrition labeling information, e.g., Nutrition Facts, need to be approved by FLD?</B>
</P>

<P>
A. Yes. Nutrition labeling information must be approved in sketch by FLD. Once a label with nutrition information is sketch-approved by FLD, the establishment can make generic labels based on the sketch. Quantitative changes, except for serving size, can be made to the nutrition information provided they are accurate and consistent. Nutrition labeling that was approved prior to July 1, 1996, would not have to be resubmitted to FLD for approval.
</P>

<P>
<B>11. Q. With the deletion of Policy Memo 096, "Approval of Labels for Experimental/Sample Products," what is the inspectors' role in regard to label approval and production limits?</B>
</P>

<P>
A. Under the new prior label approval regulations, it is the plant's responsibility to approve experimental or sample product labels under the generic labeling category for consumer test product labels. Consequently, inspectors are no longer involved with approving such labels and are not to monitor or control the amount of production of such product.

<html><title> High Court Strikes Preemption Protection for 510(k) Devices</title>
<body>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/food/feds/fedshead.gif" alt="FDA Enforcement Manual">
<P>
<h2>High Court Strikes Preemption Protection for 510(k) Devices</h2>

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled June 26 in <i>Medtronic Inc. v. Lohr</i> that the
preemption language in the Federal Food, Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act)
does not protect premarket notification (510(k)) devices from state law tort
claims (1996 U.S. LEXIS 698 (No. 95-574)) (21 USC &#167;360k). <P>

The <i>Medtronic</i> decision is significant not only because it could result in
an
increase of personal injury lawsuits, but also because it is the Court's only
device-specific preemption ruling and, accordingly, will influence all state
product liability suits brought against device manufacturers.<P>

In a prepared statement, Medtronic Inc. said that the Court's decision returns
the legal situation for all manufacturers of 510(k) devices to the position they
faced before 1993, when the courts first began holding that product liability
claims were preempted by federal rules, based on the Court's 1992 nondevice
preemption decision in <i>Cippolone v. Liggett Group Inc.</i> (112 S.Ct. 2608
(1992)).<P>

<h3>Background</h3><P>

The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida held that the Medical
Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) preempted Lora Lohr's state law negligent design,
negligent manufacture, failure to warn and strict liability claims based on
injuries resulting from the alleged failure of a pacemaker lead manufactured by
Medtronic Inc.<P>

On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held on July 3,
1995, that only the negligent manufacture and failure to warn claims are
preempted. Following the Eleventh Circuit's ruling, Medtronic petitioned the
Supreme Court, Lohr cross-petitioned, and the Court granted both cases a
consolidated review.<P>

On April 23, the Court heard the case, addressing several critical preemption
questions: (1) Whether or not the MDA ever preempts a state law tort action; and
(2) If so, does the MDA preempt the state-law tort claims brought by Lohr (see
"Supreme Court Hears <i>Medtronic Inc. v. Lohr</i> ...," June 1996, p. 8). <P>

The Court's 5-4 decision in <i>Medtronic</i> upholds the Eleventh Circuit's
ruling that
the negligent design and strict liability  claims are not preempted and therefore
may be pursued.  The decision reversed the Eleventh Circuit's ruling that Lohr's
negligent manufacture and failure to warn claims are preempted. Thus, the Supreme
Court found none of Lohr's claims are preempted. The case has been remanded to
Florida state court. <P>

<h3>'Requirement' Definition Debated</h3><P>

During oral arguments, Medtronic suggested that the MDA's preemption provision
precludes all common law claims against a device manufacturer and that the term
"requirement" should be given a consistent reading, even though Congress did not
explicitly state its intentions.  <P>

Because the statutory language of the preemption provision is ambiguous -- it
uses the term "requirement" several times without clarifying what those
requirements include -- "if Congress intended to preclude all common-law causes
of action, it chose a singularly odd word with which to do it," Justices John
Paul Stevens, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg opined.  <P>

Their opinion states that Medtronic's argument "is not only unpersuasive, it is
implausible" because it has "the perverse effect of granting complete immunity
from design defect liability to an entire industry that, in the judgment of
Congress, needed more stringent regulation in order 'to provide for the safety
and effectiveness of medical devices....'"  <P>

In the dissenting opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that state common
law damages actions "do impose 'requirements' and are therefore preempted" when
they differ from the FD&amp;C Act's requirements.  Citing <i>Cippolone</i>, in
which
the Court evaluated the presumption against preemption for cigarettes, Justice
O'Connor stated that there is a conflict between the statute's language and a
general understanding of common law damages actions.  She asserts that if the
plain language of the statute is recognized, then preemption must prevail.  <P>

"The plurality's reason for departing from this reading are neither clear nor
persuasive," Justice O'Connor wrote. <P>

<h3>Deference to FDA?</h3><P>

The issue of deferring to the FDA to establish preemption parameters was the
subject of debate during oral arguments, and the justices were divided about
whether or not such deference is appropriate.<P>

Justice Stevens wrote in the plurality opinion that the ambiguity in the statute
gives "substantial weight" to deferring to the agency's view of the statute. In a
separate opinion, Justice Steven Breyer agreed that when Congress' intent is
ambiguous, courts may infer that the relevant administrative agency possesses "a
degree of leeway to determine which rules, regulations, or other administrative
actions will have a [preemptive] effect." <P>

In its implementing regulations for preemption, the FDA states that state
requirements are preempted only when there are <i>specific</i> federal
requirements
applicable to a particular device, rendering any <i>divergent</i> state
requirements for
devices different from, or in addition to, the specific federal requirements (21
CFR &#167;808.1(d)). <P>

Justice Breyer interpreted the agency's use of the word "specific" as narrowing
the "universe of federal requirements that the agency intends to displace at
least some state law." This analysis of specificity was a central point in
Justice Breyer's concurring opinion, creating the 5-4 majority against
preemption. <P>

Justice O'Connor contended that deference to the agency is inappropriate because
she interpreted the term requirement to encompass state common law causes of
action. "Where the language of the statute is clear, resort to the agency's
interpretation is improper," she writes. Further, she wrote that the statute
"makes no mention of a requirement of specificity ...." <P>

<h3>Design Unprotected by 510(k)</h3><P>

The Court's opinion states that the 510(k) process does not offer protection from
state negligent design claims because it was developed to maintain the status quo
with respect to the marketing of existing devices and their substantial
equivalents.<P>

"That status quo included the possibility that the manufacturer of the device
would have to defend itself against state-law claims of negligent design," the
opinion states. <P>

Although Justice O'Connor wrote that the FDA's good manufacturing practice and
labeling requirements should preempt Lohr's negligent manufacture and failure to
warn claims because they impose additional requirements, she agreed with the
plurality that Lohr's defective design claim is not preempted by the 510(k)
process, because that process "merely evaluates whether the Class III device at
issue is substantially equivalent ...."  <P>

It should be noted, one device law attorney states, that courts still can
consider preemption for devices cleared through the premarket approval (PMA)
process, because these devices already have been approved by the FDA as having
met federal safety and efficacy requirements. In not ruling on preemption for PMA
products -- and because the majority against preemption was slim -- the Court
left open the issue of preemption protection for PMA devices.<P>

Medtronic said that it was pleased that the Court did not rule out the potential
for preemption for PMAs, "where the FDA has a much more detailed design review
process," an issue currently under review in the lower courts. <P>

<h3>Reaction to the Ruling</h3><P>

The <i>Medtronic</i> decision is considered a victory for consumers by Public
Citizen
Litigation Group, which argued for Lohr before the Court.  Public Citizen
attorney Brian Wolfman stated that "the Supreme Court recognized that the purpose
of the medical device laws is to protect consumers ... not to immunize
manufacturers from liability." <P>

Conversely, House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J. Bliley (R-Va.) aligned
himself with industry and commented that the June 26 decision "reverses 20 years
of federal law exempting medical devices approved by the FDA from lawsuits in the
State Courts." <P>

The Health Industry Manufacturers Association (HIMA) is disappointed in the
Court's decision because it may represent a "potential step backwards for medical
device innovation," according to Alan Magazine, HIMA's president. "Unfortunately,
[the] decision may have the immediate impact of subjecting medical device
companies to a confusing maze of differing state product tort liability laws,"
Magazine said.<P>

Wayne K. Barlow, vice chairman of the Medical Device Manufacturers Association
(MDMA), agreed that the decision could have a significant impact on small
companies.<P>

"This is a setback for medical device innovation," Barlow said. "This decision
has more of an impact for the small companies, who tend to be far more
innovative." <P>

However, the Court's opinion states that "nowhere in the materials relating to
the Act's history have we discovered a reference to a fear that product liability
actions would hamper the development of medical devices."<P>

<center><h4>MDA Preemption in the Courts -- a Chronology</h4></center><P>

<font size=-1>
Editor's Note: Cases are listed in chronological order within the designated year.<p>

<b>1992</b><P>

<i>Slater v. Optical Radiation Corp.</i> (961 F.2d 1330, 7th Cir.)<P>

State claims for defective design and failure to warn relating to an
investigational device are preempted.<P>

<b>1993</b><P>

<i>King v. Collagen Corp.</i> (983 F.2d 1130, 1st Cir.)<P>

State claims for breach of warranty are preempted because they create a
requirement "in addition to" the MDA.<P>

<i>Stamps v. Collagen Corp.</i> (984 F.2d 1416, 5th Cir.)<P>

State claims for product liability, failure to warn and negligence are preempted
because they are state requirements "relating to safety or effectiveness."
Decision limited to Class III devices.<P>

<b>1995</b><P>

<i>Michael v. Shiley, Inc.</i> (46 F.3d 1316, 3rd Cir.)<P>

State claims relating to a Class III device and arising from voluntary express
warranties and promotional materials are not preempted. Court holds that express
warranties are not a form of state-imposed regulatory requirements and that
misleading advertisements violate a general duty not to deceive.<P>

<i>Lohr v. Medtronic, Inc.</i> (56 F.3d 1335, 11th Cir.)<P>

Negligent design and strict liability claims for Class III 510(k) device are not
preempted because there are no existing federal design requirements.<P>

<i>Feldt v. Mentor Corp.</i> (61 F.3d 431, 5th Cir.)<P>

Negligent design claims for Class III 510(k) device are not preempted because
there are no existing federal design requirements.<P>

<i>Duvall v. Bristol-Meyers Squibb</i> (65 F.3d 392, 4th Cir.)<P>

State negligent design claims are preempted because the 510(k) process is itself
a federal requirement with full preemptive effect.<P>

<i>English v. Mentor Corp.</i> (67 F.3d 477, 3rd Cir.)<P>

Court holds that 510(k) process is itself a federal requirement with full
preemptive effect.<P>

<i>Mitchell v. Collagen Corp.</i> (67 F.3d 1268, 7th Cir.)<P>

State negligent design and strict liability claims are preempted, but
adulteration claim is not.<P>

<i>Kennedy v. Collagen Corp.</i> (67 F.3d 1453, 9th Cir.)<P>

State common laws claims were brought under law of "general applicability," not
under law representing a positive state enactment and thus are not preempted.
Court holds that common law claims are never preempted and rejects presumption of
preemption for Class III devices.<P>

<b>1996</b><P>

<i>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr</i> (1996 U.S. LEXIS 698 (No. 95-574))<P>

Supreme Court holds that 510(k) requirements do not preempt liability claims but
leaves open whether premarket approval (PMA) products are protected from state
law claims.<P>

<i>Mitchell v. Collagen Corp.</i> (1996 U.S. LEXIS 4286 (No. 95-1323))<P>

Remanded to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.<P>

<h2>Telecom issues dominate watershed NATOA conference</h2>

<h3><i>Cable takes back seat to planning, rights-of-way</i></h3><P>

While cable regulation is still in force, the days of the local official who only
wears the cable regulator's hat may be numbered. <P>

This was the message of the 16th annual National Association of
Telecommunications Officers and Administrators (NATOA) conference. Local
regulators, speakers said, must conceive of their responsibilities in much
broader terms than as simply cable regulators to keep pace with sweeping
regulatory and technological changes and negotiate effectively with new wireline
and wireless providers seeking to offer a variety of telecommunications services
in their locality. <P>

A telling sign was what topics were on the conference agenda -- and those that
were omitted. The NATOA gathering was dominated by discussions on rights-of-way
issues, telecommunications planning and local telephone competition, while
multichannel video issues were of secondary concern. As a sign of technological
convergence and emerging local telephone and video competition, little
distinction was made between telephone and cable companies. And, the role of the
FCC was less prominent in the minds of many conference speakers, who focused more
on how localities can develop policies to manage the regulatory challenges of
local competition.<P>

Indeed, the 1996 conference signified a watershed moment for local governments.
While the 1995 conference attempted to grapple with imminent, groundbreaking
telecommunications legislation, and its impact on cable regulation, the 1996
meeting set out to develop a new view of local telecommunications regulation and
the responsibilities and obligations local officials have to their
communities.<P>

Major themes of the conference included: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Local officials are no longer just cable administrators, but must become
adept at broad telecommunications planning for their communities.<P>
<LI>Managing public rights-of-way and ensuring that all providers -- whether
video, telephony or data networking -- pay a fair market price for their use is
one of the most important functions of local telecommunications administrators.
<P>
<LI>As information technology plays an increasingly prominent role in the
economy, local telecommunications authorities will have an unprecedented
influence in determining the economic vitality and future of their communities
through their telecommunications policies. <P>
<LI>Local agencies can no longer work in isolation since the issues before them
are too complex and can often be solved only through interdepartmental
coordination. <P>
<LI>The next round of regulatory battles will be fought at the state level -- not
the FCC. Indeed, state legislatures are being besieged by telecommunications
lobbyists attempting to reduce city powers over their telecommunications affairs.
</UL> <P>

<h3><i>Where is telecom heading?</i></h3><P>

Where is telecommunications regulation heading? To the state house.<P>

According to many conference speakers, now that the 1996 act has passed,
telecommunications providers are shifting their lobbying energies from the FCC to
influencing how state telecommunications legislation is crafted. "A lot is going
on in state legislatures," warned  Adrian Herbst, an attorney at Fredrikson &amp;
Byron, Minneapolis, "and the telephone companies are lobbying there to narrow the
authority of local governments." <P>

"Every state will be looking at a major legislative debate in January 1997,"
remarked Nick Miller, attorney at Miller, Canfield, Paddock &amp; Stone,
Washington, D.C., adding that it was uncertain whether local governments were
really prepared to defend their interests. <P>

Wireline telecommunications generates $184 billion per year, Miller said, with
telephone, competitive access and long distance providers generating almost eight
times more revenue per year than cable television. Miller said rights-of-way fees
from the telecommunications market could generate roughly $18 billion in annual
revenue for local governments. With the financial stakes so high, Miller said,
telecommunications companies will aggressively lobby to curtail local power, and
he exhorted local franchise authorities to make all telecommunications providers
pay the true economic value for using public rights-of-way. <P>

<h3><i>'Old' cable vs. 'new' cable</i></h3><P>

We are also in the midst of the transition from "old cable to new cable"
according to Dan Brenner, vice president for law and regulatory policy at the
National Cable Television Association. "Cable is a much different business today
than it was at the time of the 1992 Cable Act."<P>

Speaking on the future of telecommunications from a national industry
perspective, Brenner said "old cable" was preoccupied with rate regulation, PEG
access and filling up unused channel capacity; "new cable" faces vigorous MMDS
and DBS competition from larger and more sophisticated players, emerging threats
from local exchange carriers and a dearth of channel capacity. And, as a sign of
the times, Brenner said most of his regulatory work at NCTA is on
telecommunications -- not cable.<P>

John Hunter, vice president of the United States Telephone Association, said most
telephone companies will seek to offer video service "through a traditional cable
franchise," adding that more than 300 local exchange carriers already offer video
service, most in rural areas.<P>

What is the role of local government as phone competition heats up? Hunter
emphasized that local governments need to ensure a level-playing field for all
competitors. Brenner argued local governments should focus on achieving "real
competition, which is facilities-based -- not just reselling," where phone
companies rent wires from local exchange companies to provide local service. And,
he added, "governments should be less concerned about price regulation." Most
importantly, Brenner said, local governments should seek above all to "do no
harm" in attempting to regulate and implement local competition.<P>

<h3><i>The local perspective</i></h3><P>

While rights-of-way issues, a major subject, the conference, Norman Sinel, an
attorney with Arnold &amp; Porter, Washington, D.C., contended that "towers and
tower sites will be the biggest issue" affecting local governments. Addressing a
session on the local government perspective of telecommunications, Sinel said the
time of being simply a cable regulator is over, with the new complexities of
local competition in a multitude of services, rights-of-way management, zoning
and tower issues.<P>

And don't expect the FCC to be the friend of localities, Sinel said, charging
that the commission is "aggressively attempting to  displace local government to
foster [its] doctrinaire concept of national telecommunications" in which it
"wants everybody in the way to get out of the way." Sinel contended that the FCC,
states, cable companies and telephone companies all want to impinge on local
government authority. <P>

Nick Miller suggested that local governments should see "telecommunications as a
tool to make society function better" rather than as an end in itself. But,
echoing Sinel, Miller reminded attendees that telecommunications companies will
pick "a forum where cities have the weakest voice, such as in the FCC," and will
attempt to "take advantage of local policy makers' ignorance on issues, such as
tower siting." To counter telecommunications companies, Miller recommended that
cities:<P>
<UL><P>
<LI>pool resources on legal battles;<P>
<LI>develop model local telecommunications ordinances and rights-of-way
agreements;<P>
<LI>execute a media and community relations initiative; and<P>
<LI>prepare and defend for litigation.</UL><P>

Miller said legislative battles are "inevitable in every state," but that the
basic city interests -- rights-of-way property rights, among others -- are
clearly defined and should be defended. <P>

<h3><i>The new age of telecom planning</i></h3><P>

To help regulators understand local competition and complexities of rights-of-way
management, the conference focused on telecommunications planning at the local
level.<P>

In a panel session on this topic, Adrian Herbst told attendees that to be
effective telecommunications planners, they "should no longer think in terms of
cable companies, and telephone companies, but in terms of the services they
offer." Local regulators, he said, need to distinguish between video and
telecommunications services. To this end, a sound telecommunications plan should
encompass three areas: <P>
<UL><P>
<LI>public rights-of-way;<P>
<LI>antenna towers; and <P>
<LI>community needs. </UL><P>

"Now is the key time to be proactive." That was the message from attorney Joseph
Van Eaton, who touted the virtues of developing a proactive plan so
telecommunications firms don't dictate their terms of service. "If you're always
on the defensive," the attorney from Miller, Canfield, Paddock &amp; Stone,
Washington, D.C., said, "your revenue is at risk." Knowing your
telecommunications needs, he said, requires coordinating planning city-wide with
the management information systems, public works and financial departments. This,
in turn, requires a thorough assessment of your city's telecommunications
needs.<P>

The centerpiece of a telecommunications plan is deriving fair compensation for
use of the public rights-of-way: "Every time you dig up the streets, the road's
life is decreased and road budgets increase," Van Eaton said, warning that if
cities "are not fairly compensated for rights-of-way usage, they are essentially
subsidizing telecommunications companies." <P>

Van Eaton said telcommunications companies are expressing "anti-city" rhetoric to
the FCC, and attempting to educate the FCC staff on their point of view, while
the commission is not really aware of what cities are thinking. Van Eaton
suggested contacting FCC staff on what cities are doing to implement the 1996 act
and renew franchises. Currently, he claimed, all the FCC is hearing (from telecom
companies) is that "cities are abusing their power." <P>

<h3><i>Preparing for a 'telestuff'</i></h3><P>

What will be the impact of wireless communications on local governments? <P>

Hal McCombs, an attorney at Duncan, Weinberg, Miller &amp; Pembroke, Washington,
D.C., advised local communities to prepare for a flurry of wireless "telestuff"
that will be coming soon to localities: new personal communications services,
local multipoint distribution service, millimeter waive 40 GHz services, wireless
competitive access providers, enhanced specialized mobile radio services, 18 GHz
services, etc.<P>

What does this all mean? More and more transmitter sites will have to be built
and more potential zoning conflicts in local communities over towers in
residential neighborhoods. <P>

Larry Beer, with the consulting firm SBA of Denver, Inc., said that while 30,000
wireless tower sites have been built thus far, another 100,000 tower sites will
be built in the next five to 10 years. Beer said "to expect as many 10 carriers
per market." Local governments, Beer said, will be affected by new demands for
zoning, and for leasing municipal facilities, which could be a new source of
revenue for cities. <P>

With all of this activity, Beer warned attendees "to be prepared to handle a
greater caseload of wireless permit applications." It is imperative, Beer said,
to clarify division responsibilities between the planning department and
telecommunications regulators, which "can't work at cross-purposes" if good
telecommunications planning is to be accomplished. <P>

<h3><i>Navigating through refranchising</i></h3><P>

Before commencing negotiations with cable operators on a franchise renewal, make
sure you thoroughly assess the past performance of the operator, said Ila Feld,
an attorney with Leibowitz &amp; Associates, P.A., Miami, at a session on
refranchising.<P>

Feld offered a few tips on preparing for renewal negotiations:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Assess your community's needs and "pay careful attention to subscribers'
needs."<P>
<LI>Assess the cable operator's performance -- "be knowledgeable about the
operator before sitting down to negotiate." Feld advised attendees to be able "to
go point-by-point through the previous franchise agreement to verify whether the
operator has satisfied all of its obligations."<P>
<LI>Know what kind of system the operator is. Hire outside consultants and
engineers if necessary to understand the technical features of the cable
system.<P>
<LI>Do a financial audit of the system. Make sure all payments have been
made.</OL><P>

<h3><i>A rapprochement with TCI?</i></h3><P>

In one session, local government officials were invited to sit down with multiple
system cable operators to discuss a variety of  issues. TCI Communications
representatives and local franchisers overseeing TCI systems, discussed issues
such as franchise renewals, customer service, telecommunications franchising, and
rights-of-way.<P>

A number of franchisers were annoyed that they had received "boilerplate"
documents from TCI systems seeking renewals. This tactic, the franchisers said,
creates an adversarial tone immediately. TCI representatives denied that the MSO
uses boilerplate documents for renewals as a corporate policy, and emphasized
that the franchisers must have a realistic appraisal of what their community
needs and what the TCI's affiliate can afford. For example, "it doesn't make
sense for every market to warrant a 750 MHz upgrade based on return of investment
analysis," a TCI rep said. The TCI rep also said that operators are concerned
about "opening up their books to everyone" when franchisers ask financial
information. <P>

With regard to customer service, one franchiser suggested that TCI should have
people manning call centers who live in the community that customers are calling
from. Another gripe: some franchisers thought TCI's billing policies in their
service areas were unnecessarily confusing and caused an inordinate amount of
late fees accruing to customers. <P>

What must subscribers do to get new programming carried on their TCI system?
There is no simple formula on the number of subscribers it takes to get new
programming added, a TCI rep said. One constraint is the bulk programming
agreements the national MSO enters into, making it hard to take off a network in
only a few systems. In addition, removing programming often generates opposition,
too. TCI does do national polling, the TCI rep said, to determine what
programming it should carry.<P>

The TCI reps emphasized that upgrades should be "market driven" and a "business
decision made on a case-by-case basis." But franchisers suggested that the MSO
should not pre-emptively remove upgrade considerations from renewal discussions,
but rather justify their unwillingness to upgrade with local financial and
business data. <P>
<P>

<h3><i>Tips on telecom planning</i></h3><P>

Susan Littlefield, cable regulatory administrator for St. Louis, offered a few
tips on telecommunications planning for administrators at the NATOA conference.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Don't confuse the difference between being a landlord and a regulator. "Local
governments are generally landlords first and regulators second," Littlefield
said, and the use of public rights-of-way should be conceived as the renting of
public property in which the local government is the landlord. Littlefield
reminded attendees that "landlords have the right to determine appropriate
compensation for use of their property."  
<LI>Make sure similar services receive the same treatment: "Similar providers of
similar services must be subject to similar requirements, so that no provider
receives unequal or preferential treatment." 
<LI>Research the telecommunications businesses seeking to use the rights-of-way:
"Invite various prospective telecommunications providers to talk about their
business" to learn as much as possible about the the financial and technical
dimension of their businesses.
<LI>Think of yourself as both a consumer and regulator. A number of presenters
emphasized that local governments are the largest consumers of telecommunications
services in their cities, which gives them leverage in any negotiations with
telecommunications providers. 
<LI>Know where all of the rights-of-way are located so that a thorough evaluation
of a local government's needs and assessments can be made.
<LI>Create interdepartmental coalitions or task forces to figure out the best
approach to regulation and compensation. 
<LI>"Saving money is as good as making money: In-kind payments can be a great
form of rental compensation if you have identified needs," she said. 
<LI>"Talk to adjacent local governments about their policies. This makes sense,"
Littlefield said, "as cable operators increasingly cluster their systems."
</OL><P>

<h2>Supreme Court splits on access channel indecency ban</h2>

The Supreme Court has ruled that cable operators can ban indecent material on
leased access channels, but are prohibited from exercising the same control over
public, education and government (PEG) access channels. In a June 28 decision,
the High Court also limited the ability of cable operators to segregate and block
indecent programming that they choose to carry. <P>

It was a mixed decision for the cable industry, which saw only one of the three
decisions issued by the High Court go in its favor. In a 7-2 decision, the court
upheld the leased access indecency provision of the 1992 Cable Act, but voted 6-3
to strike down the provision allowing cable operators to segregate and block
indecent programming on leased access channels. Finally, the High Court voted 5-4
to strike down the PEG access indecency provision.<P>

The case combined several previous cases that had challenged the Communications
Act's provisions regarding indecent programming on access channels. Under the act
and FCC regulations, cable operators are allowed to ban "indecent" programming on
PEG channels. They are also entitled to prohibit such programming from leased
access channels, or, if they choose to carry it, place it on blocked channel,
available only to subscribers who request to view it. Congress enacted these
restrictions when passing the 1992 Cable Act in response to complaints that
children could easily watch sexually oriented programming on access channels. The
provisions also reversed language in the 1984 Cable Act that forbids cable
operators from exercising any editorial control over what programmers offered
subscribers. <P>

A lower court had ruled that the FCC's indecency regulations, which permitted
cable operators to ban or block "indecent" programming on leased access and PEG
channels, do not violate free speech rights. <P>

In <i>Alliance for Community Media vs. FCC</i> (Appendix V:5), the three High
Court decisions reversed in part the lower court decision. The U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia held that the indecency provisions for both
leased and PEG access did not create an unlawful "state action" abridging free
speech because the cable operator has editorial discretion over the content
carried on its system. The appeals court also said that access channels are not
public forums in which speech curbs would face the strictest level of scrutiny.
<P>

In an opinion delivered for the Court, Justice Stephen Breyer affirmed the rights
of cable operators to assert editorial control over indecent programming on
leased access channels. Breyer said the provision was consistent with both the
First Amendment and a compelling government interest in protecting children from
indecent programming. The reason: the provision simply enables a cable operator
to ban indecent programming on its system if it wants, rather than imposing a
federal requirement to do so. Thus, Breyer said, the provision is "a
constitutionally permissible way to protect children from the type of sexual
material that concerned Congress, while accommodating both the First Amendment
interests served by the access requirements and those served in restoring to
cable operators a degree of the editorial control that Congress removed in 1984.
. . ." <P>

But Breyer, in a separate opinion, said the segregate-and-block provision
violated the First Amendment because, unlike the provision permitting cable
operators to restrict indecent programming on leased access channels, "it does
not simply permit, but rather requires, cable system operators to restrict speech
by segregating and blocking" indecent programming. Breyer said the "restrictive
effects" of this provision on free speech include requiring subscribers to
request indecent programming 30 days in advance and "the written notice
requirement," which could deter viewers from requesting the program for fear of
an inadvertent public disclosure of their request. Finally, Breyer cited the
"added costs and burdens" that this requirement imposes on cable system operators
that could be a disincentive to their carrying indecent programming. <P>

The ban on indecent programming on PEG channels was also deemed 
unconstitutional. Writing for three judges among the majority, Breyer based this
decision on two factors: cable operators have not made it a practice to interfere
with the content on these channels and, historically, there have not been
problems with indecent PEG access programming warranting giving cable
operator-imposed restrictions. <P>

In a concurring opinion, Justice David Souter, alluding to the difficulty of
regulating the media when it is in state of technological flux, advocated a
cautious approach to content regulation, stating, "We should be shy about saying
the final word today about what will be accepted as reasonable tomorrow." <P>

But Justices Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, while concurring with the
rulings on the PEG access and segregate-and-block restrictions, blasted the
majority for upholding the ban on indecent programming on leased access channels.
The justices said that decision "was an evasion of any clear legal standard" and
that the majority's willingness to cite the complexities of regulating speech on
emerging media technologies as justification for speech restrictions obfuscates
the "straightforward issue . . .of whether the government can deprive certain
speakers, on the basis of the content of their speech, of protections afforded
all others." Further, they said, "if the plurality is concerned about
technology's direction, it ought to begin by allowing speech, not suppressing
it." <P>

NCTA President and CEO Decker Anstrom lauded the High Court's decision allowing
cable operators "to exercise editorial control over indecent programming on
leased access channels, and to do so without being required to put it on a
particular channel." Anstrom added that "the decision will give cable companies
some further ability to protect the interests and concerns of our customers." But
Anstrom was disappointed that "editorial control was not extended to public
access channels as well." <P>

<h3><i>Precedents?</i></h3><P>

Are there any legal principles from this case on the First Amendment and the
cable industry that could set a precedent? "It's a work in progress," said Robert
Corn-Revere, an attorney with the Washington, D.C., law firm of Hogan and
Hartson, which represents Playboy Entertainment Group in its attempt to overturn
federal enforcement of a scrambling provision of the 1996 Telecommunications Act
(see July 1996 <i>Monthly Bulletin,</i> Page 5). <P>

Corn-Revere said the Supreme Court "is not yet ready to make a final
pronouncement on the level of First Amendment scrutiny that should apply to
cable," but added that there could soon be an emerging consensus on the Court as
to the strength of First Amendment review. And, he said, the High Court in this
case only upheld the right of cable operators to have editorial control over what
goes on their systems: "All of the justices agreed that no burdens should be
imposed." <P>

Both the segregate-and-block provision and the 1996 act's scrambling provision
impose burdens on subscribers and raise serious privacy issues, Corn-Revere
maintained. "Scrambling," he contended, "would cost tens of millions of dollars
to implement and require technicians to make a special installation at the home
of subscribers wanting to view indecent programming." Scrambling raises the
imposition of excessive burdens and privacy concerns, Corn-Revere argued, which
the majority of the Court in the indecency case already recognized as sound
reasons for not restricting free speech. <P>

<html> <title> SEC To Introduce Proposals Calling For Mutual Fund Prospectus Simplification</title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/tpg/tax/mony/monyhead.gif"  alt="Money Manager's Compliance Guide"></center>
<hr>
<h2> SEC To Introduce Proposals Calling For Mutual Fund Prospectus Simplification</h2><P>
<body>

The Securities and Exchange Commission plans to propose several rules to assist

the mutual fund industry in providing investors with prospectus documents that

are more user friendly, because the commission's efforts over the last few years

to encourage the industry to simplify prospectuses under existing rules have

been largely unsuccessful, according to Heidi Stam, associate director in SEC's

Division of Investment Management.<p>

Fund prospectuses gradually have been changing to provide investment and risk

disclosures in better, more readable formats, but funds have been slow to

initiate the process, Stam said. Funds that have simplified prospectuses

generally have been direct marketed funds, where the prospectus is not only used

for information but also for marketing, she said.<p>

<h3>Risks Involved in Simplification</h3><p>

Industry has been slow to change the traditional statutory prospectus, because

simplification is time consuming, resource intensive, and has the potential to

increase a fund's liability risk, according to Pamela Wilson, senior partner

with Hale and Dorr, an outside counsel to John Hancock Funds Inc. "It takes time

to summarize information right" and the simplification process offers the mutual

fund industry "the reward of more liability risk" if not done properly, she

said.<p>

Despite the perceived risks, several funds have initiated the process because of

a desire to create a document that an investor can read and understand without

the assistance of a lawyer, Wilson said. "One of the industry's main jobs is to

keep investors involved in the process," she said. The industry "pays too high a

price when it gives an investor a document that he cannot understand" simply to

protect itself from litigation, she said.<p>

<h3>John Hancock Changes Process Dramatically<p></h3>

According to Wilson, one of the most striking prospectus simplification

processes undertaken to date was initiated by John Hancock Funds, an investment

company whose funds are sold through brokerage firms. John Hancock recently

introduced several simplified prospectuses that dramatically depart from the

traditional, boilerplate prospectus, she said.<p>

According to Thomas H. Connors, an attorney and second vice president with John

Hancock Advisers Inc., prospectus simplification is not about leaving

information out, it is about stating information in a clear, concise manner,

minimizing jargon and reducing repetitiveness. Simplification does not

necessarily have to increase liability risks; it can add to "the quality of risk

disclosure and highlight the risks in a more powerful and apparent" manner, he

said.<p>

John Hancock rethought every aspect of the prospectus and retained an outside

writer and design firm to bring a fresh perspective to the process, Connors

said. John Hancock requested no-action relief from SEC to change the format of

the prospectus, add an additional color to the document and change some of the

statutory verbiage to lower-case letters, among other things, he said. It also

deleted repetitive information and moved more technical data to the statement of

additional information, thus removing it entirely from Form N-1A.<p>

The goal was to produce simplified prospectuses that use plain language and put

information into manageable segments, Connors said. Through the simplification

process, John Hancock consolidated 34 separate fund prospectuses into six

prospectuses grouped by investment objective, resulting in an 80 percent

reduction in production costs and lower legal review costs, Connors said. John

Hancock decided to consolidate and simplify the prospectuses to make it easier

for investors to compare the risks and management styles of funds that have

similar objectives, he said.<p>

According to Connors, the new prospectuses have received favorable reviews from

investors and brokers alike. The simplification has helped brokers help

investors more effectively, he said. "Any good quality communication undoubtedly

gives a fund a leg up on its competition," he said. The end result of the

process is an educational tool that can be used by the broker and investor, and

also is a powerful risk disclosure document, he added.<p>

SEC was helpful throughout the consolidation process, and John Hancock worked

closely with the commission to produce its simplified prospectuses, Wilson said.

The primary impediment to prospectus simplification seems to be the industry and

its lawyers, and not SEC and the states, she said.<p>

According to Paul Gallagher, principal and assistant general counsel with the

Vanguard Group, a direct marketed fund, "John Hancock deserves a lot of credit

for their innovation; it was something we didn't expect from a broker-sold

fund." Vanguard also recently rewrote their prospectuses to make them more

understandable for investors. Unlike Hancock, Vanguard did not request no-action

relief from SEC, Gallagher said.

<title>Device Industry, Doctors Suspicious of FDA's Changing Regulatory Role</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/food/sell/sellhead.gif"  alt="FDA Advertising and Promotion
Manual">
<P>

<h2>Device Industry, Doctors Suspicious of FDA's Changing Regulatory Role</h2>

The FDA's increasingly restrictive regulatory approach to the promotion of

medical devices by monitoring physician training, modifying the premarket

notification (510(k)) submission and expanding the scope of enforcement is

"inconsistent with the demands of the marketplace," an industry representative

told a recent Health Industry Manufacturers Association (HIMA) meeting.<p>

The agency's policies on comparative claims, continuing medical education (CME)

and indications for use are "very conservative" and fit poorly with a changing

healthcare marketplace that places a premium on information, Michael McCulley,

assistant general counsel of Johnson &amp; Johnson, said at the July 11 HIMA

conference. <p>

Susan Alpert, director of the Office of Device Evaluation (ODE) in the FDA's

Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), defended the agency's current

approach, asserting that it is CDRH's mission to ensure that claims are

"supported by valid scientific evidence."<p>

<h3>Indications Requirement</h3><p>

In February, the ODE sent a letter to device manufacturers informing them that

they must include in their 510(k) submissions a separate sheet identifying the

specific indications for use for which a substantially equivalent determination

is sought, Alpert noted (see &#182;624). This requirement, which modifies an

existing procedure, is "driven by the labeling claims" made by the device

manufacturer, and "will reduce confusion between the agency and 510(k)

submitters on which indications for use have been cleared." <p>

She stated that "intended use" is defined as what a product "technically does,"

while the "indicated use" refers to the populations and therapeutic settings for

which the device is appropriate. Based on what they want their devices to do and

for whom, manufacturers ultimately determine the extent to which clinical trials

will be necessary to support any promotional claims, Alpert said. She contended

that the separate indications-for-use sheet will make it easier for companies to

show substantial equivalence in the 510(k) submission. Some industry members

contend that the sheet also makes it easier for CDRH to cross-reference future

promotional claims with clinical data.<p>

McCulley agreed that a device's indication for use necessarily impacts on its

marketing, but accused the FDA of "rewriting the rules" so that companies must

more narrowly define indications and consequently curtail promotional claims.

McCulley characterized this shift as similar to the FDA's current practice for

pharmaceuticals. <p>

<h3>Enforcement Challenges<p></h3>

McCulley said the regulatory maze faced by companies is broader than just FDA

requirements because other government agencies with regulatory, enforcement or

reimbursement interests in medical devices affect marketing strategies. The

Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services, the

Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and state agencies all

present regulatory challenges to device promotion, McCulley said (see sidebar,

below). <p>

The rise of managed care also has created market challenges for manufacturers,

he added. As a result, advertising and promotion in this new environment is "in

flux ... and the demand for information about products and what those products

can do has increased at a tremendous pace," McCulley said. Unfortunately, the

FDA is restricting the communication of such information, he commented. <p>

McCulley cited recent CDRH Warning Letters as examples of the agency's departure

from traditional enforcement concerns, such as claims for unapproved uses or

quality of life, fraudulent or misleading claims, fair balance issues, and use

of testimonials (see &#182;912; App. IV). In Johnson &amp; Johnson's estimation,

McCulley said, the FDA now is focusing on:<p>

<ul><li>Whether promotional claims match indications listed in the 510(k);<p>

<li>Specific claims derived from broad indications;<p>

<li>Company-provided devices for hands-on training;<p>

<li>Cost-effectiveness claims (see &#182;622);<p>

<li>Comparative and superiority claims (see &#182;621); and<p>

<li>Company-sponsored CME seminars (see &#182;631).</ul><p>

<h3>No Interference</h3><p>

McCulley further contended that the FDA's policies represent "a venture by the

agency into [regulating] the practice of medicine" because they block patient

and physician access to product information. However, Alpert and Byron Tart,

director of CDRH's Promotion and Advertising Policy Staff, disagreed with that

position. Although CDRH regulates anyone who promotes and markets devices,

including doctors, it does not regulate physicians as they work with individual

patients, Alpert said. <p>

Tart acknowledged that CDRH will step in when a doctor promotes a specific

device for an off-label use, citing a letter from the division to doctors

regarding the promotion of excimer lasers for photorefractive keratectomy as an

appropriate regulatory action to protect consumers.<p>

Moreover, CDRH will investigate physician training for devices when a

manufacturer is involved with the program, Tart said. Regulation of the practice

of medicine is a "gray area" for the FDA, Tart noted, because the FTC has

jurisdiction over the manner in which doctors market their practices (see

&#182;331). <p>

David Goldberg, chief of dermatologic surgery at the New Jersey Medical School,

told HIMA conference attendees that physicians have "a sense" that the agency is

expanding its authority over the practice of medicine and are uncomfortable with

this interference. <p>

<h3>CDRH Responds<p></h3>

Tart acknowledged that the marketing of devices "is crossing into new areas,"

such as direct-to-consumer advertising, promotion to managed care entities and

Internet communications. The FDA's effort to develop agency-wide policies in

these areas also impacts on CDRH's operations, Tart told the HIMA conference

attendees. He maintained that all FDA Centers are working together in response

to industry concerns that medical products be treated equally for purposes of

regulation and enforcement, and that the FDA is involving industry more in

guidance development.<p>

Tart conceded that his division has issued more Warning Letters recently for

nontraditional violations. He urged recipients to respond to such letters

promptly and, if they believe the FDA's position may be incorrect, to explain

why. Although the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research recently has issued

notices of violation (NOVs) for promotion violations instead of Warning Letters,

CDRH still sees the Warning Letters "as a valuable tool," Tart told the <I>Monthly Bulletin</I> (see &#182;911). <p>

"The use of the term [notice of violation] is a misnomer," Tart said. In his

view, an NOV is a communication with a firm about a potential problem about

which the agency would like more information, and should be used only for minor

issues. <p>

<h4><center>New Challenges for Device Companies<p></h4></center>

<FONT SIZE="2">Speaking at a July 11 meeting sponsored by the Health Industry Manufacturers

Association (HIMA), Michael McCulley, assistant general counsel of Johnson &amp;

Johnson, commented on the changing regulatory environment governing the

promotion of devices. When developing a device and its marketing campaign,

McCulley said, companies must now ask themselves whether the product:<p>

<ul><li>Complies with FDA requirements;<p>

<li>Is covered by Medicare/Medicaid coverage and reimbursement rules;<p>

<li>Is subject to government contracting rules;<p>

<li>Is offered in a manner consistent with the anti-kickback, anti-referral

requirements;<p>

<li>Is subject to the "best price" regulations; and<p>

<li>Is affected by any state requirements.</ul></FONT>

<html> <title> President Signs Broad Regulatory Reform Legislation To Eliminate Securities

Overlaps
Fund</title>

<h2>President Signs Broad Regulatory Reform Legislation To Eliminate Securities

Overlaps</h2><P>
<body>

President Clinton Oct. 11 signed broad securities reform legislation designed to

eliminate the regulatory overlap between states and the federal government and

simplify regulations governing mutual funds and corporate securities. The

National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 also will reduce Securities

and Exchange Commission registration fees and stabilize SEC's funding structure,

according to a written statement released by the White House.<p>

Clinton said the "legislation represents the most significant overhaul of the

securities regulatory structure in decades" and achieves the "difficult task of

improving the efficiency of the financial markets without compromising investor

protections." SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt agreed and applauded Congress for its

show of bipartisanship.<p>

In an attempt to relieve the investment industry from conflicting and burdensome

regulation by state and federal securities authorities and recognize the

national character of markets, the law streamlines regulatory authority by

dividing responsibility for financial market activities between SEC and

states.<p>

Under the law, SEC is given broad exemptive authority under both the Securities

Act of 1933 (1933 Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for all national

market and large investment advisor activities. The law amends the Investment

Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) to exempt from state regulation any security

issued by a registered open-end or closed-end investment company. In addition,

the law preempts states from regulating securities offered by mutual funds and

stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, NASDAQ

and other exchanges identified by SEC as providing comparable listing

standards.<p>

Because the law precludes state regulators from reviewing SEC filings including

investment company prospectuses and advertising published by or on behalf of the

fund, the preemption is expected to alleviate the difficulties funds currently

encounter from inconsistent state regulation of fund disclosure practices and

investment policies.<p>

In addition, broker-dealers and others are expected to benefit from the division

of SEC and state activities because they will no longer be subject to "dozens of

differing state net capital and books and records requirements," Clinton said.

The law also provides SEC with broad authority to require investment companies

and their affiliates to preserve and maintain additional books and records, but

prohibits SEC from disclosing a fund's internal compliance records to persons

requesting them under the Freedom of Information Act.<p>

Although states lose regulatory authority over certain securities and mutual

funds, they retain authority to bring enforcement actions against fraudulent

conduct, to require investment company issuers to file--for notice purposes--any

document filed with SEC under the 1933 Act, and to continue to impose the same

filing and registration fees on investment companies that are currently in

effect. As a result of the preemption, state enforcement activity is likely to

focus now on sales practices, according to industry experts.<p>

Under the law, state regulators were given responsibility for smaller issues and

investment advisors with smaller portfolios--those with client assets of less

than $25 million. According to industry experts, the new law may create

uncertainty for attorneys who advise smaller investment advisers, because many

states do not have rules on investment advisers.<p>

The changes are expected to give SEC the authority to deal with individual

situations and address "misleading" fund names or ones that use words such as

"government," "guaranteed" or "insured" in a manner that causes investors to

incorrectly conclude that their investments are guaranteed by federal or state

authorities.<p>

Under the new law, SEC also is required to adopt rules that will allow funds to

create new advertising prospectuses that are not limited by statutory prospectus

information. This change will allow funds to communicate directly with investors

and to distribute an advertising prospectus without a statutory prospectus.<p>

The law amends the 1940 Act to increase the flexibility of the investment

company industry to create "funds of funds" without undergoing the

time-consuming and expensive SEC exemptive application process. In addition to

codifying the expansive positions taken by SEC in several recent exemptive

orders on funds of funds, the law provides SEC with the authority to grant, by

rule or order, additional exemptions to investment companies wanting to

establish funds of funds as the marketplace changes.<p>

The law also provides SEC with $20 million of additional funding to supervise

investment advisers, cuts fees that public corporations pay for routine filings

with SEC by $850 million over 10 years, and lets brokerage firms borrow from

financial institutions other than banks.

<title>Supreme Court's Preemption Decision in Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr Hurts 510(k)s</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/xray/xrayhead.gif" alt="Guide to Medical Device
Regulation"></center>
<P>
<h2>Supreme Court's Preemption Decision in <I>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr</I> Hurts 510(k)s</h2>

<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled June 26 in <I>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr</I> that the preemption language in the Federal Food, Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act) does not protect premarket notification (510(k)) devices from state law tort claims (21 USC &#167;360k, see App. I). 
</P>

<P>
The <I>Medtronic</I> decision is significant because it largely extinguishes the opportunity for immunity from common law suits for products cleared through the 510(k) process (1996 U.S. LEXIS 698 (No. 95-574)). Importantly, the Court denied a lower court's determination that preemption from labeling and manufacturing claims was appropriate, even though specific FDA requirements existed in those areas. The FDA's regulations state that state requirements are preempted if there are federal "counterpart regulations" in place (see &#182;1300).
</P>

<P>
In a prepared statement, Medtronic Inc. said that the Court's decision returns the legal situation for all manufacturers of 510(k) devices to the position they faced before 1993, when the courts first began holding that product liability claims were preempted by federal regulatory requirements, based on the high court's 1992 nondevice preemption decision in <I>Cippolone v. Liggett Group Inc.</I> (112 S.Ct. 2608 (1992)), (see "Presumption Against Preemption ...," p. 3). 
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Background</H3>
</P>

<P>
The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida held that the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) preempted Lora and Michael Lohrs' state law negligent design, negligent manufacture, failure to warn and strict liability claims based on injuries resulting from the alleged failure of a pacemaker lead manufactured by Medtronic Inc. and implanted in Lora Lohr.
</P>

<P>
On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held on July 3, 1995, that only the negligent manufacture and failure to warn claims were preempted. Following the Eleventh Circuit's ruling, Medtronic petitioned the Supreme Court, the Lohrs cross-petitioned and the Court granted both petitions for review (see "Supreme Court to Review 510(k) Preemption Issues ...," March 1996, p. 1).
</P>

<P>
On April 23, the Court heard the case, addressing two critical preemption questions: (1) Whether or not the MDA ever preempts a state law tort action; and (2) If so, does the MDA preempt the state law tort claims brought by the Lohrs (see "Supreme Court Hears <I>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr</I> ...," June 1996, p. 1). 
</P>

<P>
The Court's 5-4 decision in <I>Medtronic</I> upholds the Eleventh Circuit's ruling that the negligent design and strict liability claims are not preempted and, therefore, may be pursued. The decision, authored by Justice John Paul Stevens, also reverses the Eleventh Circuit's ruling that the Lohrs' negligent manufacture and failure to warn claims are preempted. Thus, the Supreme Court found none of the Lohrs' claims to be preempted. The case has been remanded to Florida state court.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>'Requirement' Debated</H3>
</P>

<P>
During oral arguments, Medtronic suggested that the MDA's preemption provision precludes all common law claims against a device manufacturer and that the term "requirement," which appears in numerous places in the statute, should be given a broad reading, even though Congress did not explicitly state its intentions in that regard.

</P> 
<P>
The Court rejected Medtronic's argument that the term "requirement" means general requirements. Indeed, the opinion states that Medtronic's argument "is not only unpersuasive, it is implausible" because it has "the perverse effect of granting complete immunity from design defect liability to an entire industry that, in the judgment of Congress, needed more stringent regulation in order 'to provide for the safety and effectiveness of medical devices.'" 
</P>

<P>
Instead, the Court reasoned that based on the purpose of the FD&amp;C Act -- to protect consumers -- an appropriate deference to the FDA's interpretation of the term requirement -- to mean a specific requirement for a particular device -- common law torts would not be preempted by the Act. Justice Stevens, joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, wrote in the plurality opinion that "if Congress intended to preclude all common-law causes of action, it chose a singularly odd word with which to do it." In other words, consistent with its reasoning in past cases, the Court concluded that it was not "the clear and manifest purpose of Congress" to preempt common law torts. 
</P>

<P>
In dissent, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor (writing on behalf of Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice William Rehnquist), wrote that state common law damages actions "do impose 'requirements' and are therefore preempted" when they differ from the FD&amp;C Act's requirements. Citing <I>Cippolone</I>, in which the Court applied its historical presumption against preemption of state laws relating to the regulation of cigarette promotion, Justice O'Connor stated that there is a conflict between the statute's language and a general understanding of common law damages actions. She asserted that if the plain language of the statute is recognized, then preemption must prevail. 
</P>

<P>
"The plurality's reason for departing from this reading are neither clear nor persuasive," Justice O'Connor wrote. 
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Deference to FDA?</H3>
</P>

<P>
Whether the Court should defer to the FDA for such purely legal issues as preemption was a hot issue of debate during oral arguments before the Court. Although the justices were divided about whether or not such deference should be shown the FDA for issues like preemption, nonetheless the Court concluded that deference is appropriate in <I>Medtronic</I>. 
</P>

<P>
Justice Stevens gave the FDA's view, as expressed in its regulations, "substantial weight" (21 CFR &#167;808.1(d), see App. II). In a separate opinion, Justice Steven Breyer agreed that when the statute is ambiguous, the relevant administrative agency possesses "a degree of leeway to determine which rules, regulations, or other administrative actions will have a [preemptive] effect." In this case, it is not surprising that the Court deferred to the FDA because the Court did not view the preemption issue as separate from the rest of the Act that the agency is charged with enforcing. In other words, the FDA's expertise in the regulatory arena was germane to determining the scope of preemption. 
</P>

<P>
Accordingly, in rejecting preemption, the Court relied upon the FDA's view that preemption only applies when there are <I>specific</I> federal requirements applicable to a particular device, rendering inapplicable any <I>divergent</I> state requirements for devices different from, or in addition to, the specific federal requirements (21 CFR &#167;808.1(d), see App. II). 
</P>

<P>
The Court's acceptance of the specificity or narrowness of the FDA's regulations is the cornerstone of its opinion, and was a central point in Justice Breyer's concurring opinion, thus creating the 5-4 majority against preemption. 
</P>

<P>
Justice O'Connor contended that deference to the agency is inappropriate because she interpreted the term requirement to encompass state common law causes of action. "Where the language of the statute is clear, resort to the agency's interpretation is improper," she wrote. Further, she wrote that the statute "makes no mention of a requirement of specificity." 
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Design Unprotected by 510(k)</H3>
</P>

<P>
The Court's opinion stated that the 510(k) process does not offer protection from state negligent design claims because it was developed to maintain the status quo with respect to the marketing of existing devices and their substantial equivalents.
</P>

<P>
"That status quo included the possibility that the manufacturer of the device would have to defend itself against state-law claims of negligent design," the opinion states. 
</P>

<P>
Justice O'Connor wrote that the FDA's good manufacturing practice and labeling requirements should preempt the Lohrs' negligent manufacture and failure to warn claims because they impose additional requirements. However, she agreed with the plurality that the Lohrs' defective design claim is not preempted by the 510(k) process, because that process "merely evaluates whether the Class III device at issue is substantially equivalent." 
</P>

<P>
It should be noted, one device law attorney states, that courts still can consider preemption for devices cleared through the premarket approval (PMA) process, because specific devices will be found to have met federal safety and efficacy requirements. The Court did not have a PMA preemption question before it, and did not directly address preemption in the PMA context. Nonetheless, the Court's opinion does not appear to leave much room for the preemption of state common law actions, the attorney told the <I>Bulletin</I>. Because the majority against preemption in <I>Medtronic</I> was slim, a PMA preemption issue likely will be before the Court in the future, the attorney predicted. 
</P>

<P>
Medtronic said that it was pleased that the Court did not rule out the potential for preemption for PMAs, "where the FDA has a much more detailed design review process," an issue currently under review in the lower courts. 
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Reaction to the Ruling</H3>
</P>

<P>
The <I>Medtronic</I> decision is considered a victory for consumers by Public Citizen Litigation Group, which argued for the Lohrs before the Court. Public Citizen attorney Brian Wolfman stated that "the Supreme Court recognized that the purpose of the medical device laws is to protect consumers ... not to immunize manufacturers from liability." 
</P>

<P>
Conversely, House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J. Bliley (R-Va.) aligned himself with industry and commented that the June 26 decision "reverses 20 years of federal law exempting medical devices approved by the FDA from lawsuits in the State Courts." 
</P>

<P>
"Who will be willing to supply American patients with pacemakers and heart pumps, knowing they can be hauled into any one of 50 State Courts even if they scrupulously comply with the rigorous standards set forth by the FDA?" Bliley said in a prepared statement.
</P>

<P>
The Health Industry Manufacturers Association (HIMA) is disappointed in the Court's decision because it may represent a "potential step backwards for medical device innovation," according to Alan Magazine, HIMA's president. "Unfortunately, [the] decision may have the immediate impact of subjecting medical device companies to a confusing maze of differing state product tort liability laws," Magazine said.
</P>

<P>
The decision also could have a significant impact on small companies, according to Wayne K. Barlow, vice chairman of the Medical Device Manufacturers Association. "This is a setback for medical device innovation," Barlow said. "This decision has more of an impact for the small companies, who tend to be far more innovative." 
</P>

<P>
However, the Court's opinion states that "nowhere in the materials relating to the Act's history have we discovered a reference to a fear that product liability actions would hamper the development of medical devices."
</P>

<HR>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Presumption Against Preemption Thwarts Industry</H4>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="2">Many in the medical device industry had hoped that the U.S. Supreme Court would resolve in industry's favor the outstanding questions and conflicting interpretations of preemption at the circuit court level when it considered <I>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr</I> (1996 U.S. LEXIS 698 (No. 95-574)). Indeed, Medtronic asked the Court in its petition to remove "this burden on innovation" presented by disparate opinions in the lower courts. 
</P>

<P>
Until the Court's decision, manufacturers had hoped that preemption immunity from product liability lawsuits would continue for premarket notification (510(k)) devices. Indeed, the overriding belief was that preemption covered all device clearances, including 510(k)s, premarket approvals (PMAs) and investigational device exemptions (IDEs). 
</P>

<P>
This interpretation, as held recently by the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Third and Fourth Circuits, favored preemption for devices cleared through the 510(k) process (in <I>Duvall v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</I> (65 F.3d 392 (4th Cir. 1995) and <I>English v. Mentor Corp.</I> (67 F.3d 477 (3d Cir. 1995)), respectively).
 
</P> 
<P>
These courts' presumption toward preemption was challenged in 1995 by the following three appellate decisions:
</P>

<P>
<OL TYPE="1" START="1">
	<LI>The Eleventh Circuit's decision in <I>Lohr v. Medtronic Inc.</I>, regarding the lack of federal design requirements inherent in the 510(k) process (56 F.3d 1335, 11th Cir.);
</P>

<P>
	<LI>The Fifth Circuit's decision in <I>Feldt v. Mentor Corp.</I>, which denied preemption of design claims involving a Class III 510(k) device (61 F.3d 431, 5th Cir.); and 
</P>

<P>
	<LI>The Ninth Circuit's decision in <I>Kennedy v. Collagen</I> (67 F.3d 1453, 9th Cir.), which held that the reference to requirements in the preemption language does not include requirements imposed through state common law suits.
</OL>
</P>

<P>
Significantly, the <I>Medtronic</I> decision will limit the application of preemption severely in the future, one device attorney said, adding that there are still considerations to be made in the PMA and IDE areas. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Pending Cases</B>
</P>

<P>
The impact the <I>Medtronic</I> decision will have on device product liability cases currently pending is great. Among other cases, the Supreme Court already has remanded since the June 26 decision two cases to the appellate level -- <I>Mitchell v. Collagen Corp.</I> (1996 U.S. LEXIS 4286 (No. 95-1323)) and <I>Mentor v. Feldt</I> (1996 U.S. LEXIS 4284 (No. 95-1037)) -- and has denied <I>certiorari</I> for another: <I>Collagen Corp. v. Kennedy</I> (1996 U.S. LEXIS 4296 (No. 95-1644)). 
</P>

<P>
In a prepared statement, Medtronic states that it was surprised that the Court had reversed the trend in which the overwhelming majority of lower courts had limited product liability claims for devices cleared through the 510(k) process.
</P>

<P>
"Medtronic sought this ruling to insure that inconsistent standards created by [f]ederal and [s]tate law would not inhibit future medical innovation and limit patient choices," the statement said. </FONT>

<title>FDA Alleges High Deviation Rate During Drug and Device Inspections</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/food/feds/fedshead.gif" alt="FDA Enforcement Manual">

<h2>FDA Alleges High Deviation Rate During Drug and Device Inspections</h2>

<P>
The FDA has modified several of its enforcement practices during the past few years, but recently released data for fiscal year 1995 (FY '95) (Oct. 1, 1994 - Sept. 30, 1995) suggest little change in the high deviation rates alleged in plant inspections and, for some products, continued increases in official actions taken.
</P>

<P>
The FY '95 data, which recently were released for the first time, show that the FDA alleged deviations in 61 percent of drug inspections and 56 percent of medical device inspections, both of which represent increases over the previous fiscal year (see "Establishment Inspections, Deviation Rates, FY 1992 - FY 1995," below).  The inspectional deviation rate was 40 percent for food and cosmetics and 38 percent for biologics.
</P>

<HR><CENTER><H4 ALIGN=LEFT>Establishment Inspections, Deviation Rates, FY 1992 - FY 1995</H4>
</CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="fedsoct1.gif"><P>
</CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="2"><B>Source</B>: FY 1995 Data recently published in the <I>FDA Enforcement Story, Fiscal Year 1995</I>. Prior year data originated from FDA Quarterly Activities Report, fiscal years 1992-1994.
</FONT>
</P>
<HR>
<P>
Although the proportion of these deviations considered "serious" by the agency is unreported, the upward trend in violations seen during medical device inspections was accompanied by a substantial climb in the number of device Warning Letters issued, which increased by 10 percent over FY '94, to an all-time record of 656 (see charts, below;  "CDRH Official Sends Mixed Messages on Enforcement," November 1995, p. 1)
</P>

<P>
However, in other product areas, the FDA data show either consistent or downward trends in official enforcement actions. For drugs, the number of Warning Letters declined to 329 for FY '95 from 402 in FY '94, while food and cosmetic Warning Letters rose slightly to 318, up from 301.
</P>

<P>
Fluctuations in FDA enforcement data may reflect many different factors, but experts say that the current trends reflect agency strategies that rely heavily on: the product approval process to ensure compliance, improved targeting through computerized record keeping, and, particularly, an agency desire to maintain low visibility because of congressional pressure to lighten regulatory burdens.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Shifting Landscape?</H3>
</P>

<P>
One strategy that experts believe has been employed at the agency is the use of "untitled letters." Unlike the Warning Letter, the untitled letter is not an official notice for violations of law and does not attract the same level of publicity. Some experts have estimated that the agency currently issues hundreds of untitled letters each year.
</P>

<P>
However, in cases involving new product applications, the FDA frequently can achieve its compliance objectives by putting an application on hold, rather than using an "official" enforcement action. Roughly one-third of new drug applications (NDAs) are withheld due to good manufacturing practice (GMP) deviations detected by the FDA during preapproval inspections (see "FDA Cites Leading Deviations in Withholding NDA Approvals," September 1996, p. 1).  In addition, drug-related preapproval inspections can be funded through user fees -- meaning that the FDA expends little or none of its regular budget for inspections associated with a pending drug application.
</P>

<P>
The exception to this trend would appear to occur in medical devices, where no user fees exist and where enforcement data show no downward trends. Further, roughly 98 percent of devices are cleared through premarket notification, a process usually not involving preapproval inspection.
</P>

<P>
In food and cosmetic products, the number of FDA enforcement actions has changed minimally, but the agency's figures may not reflect a growing number of independent state actions in enforcing the food labeling provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act). During 1995, states received new authority to directly enforce the federal food labeling laws without ongoing FDA oversight.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Import Shift</H3>
</P>

<P>
Perhaps the greatest change occurring during FY '95 was the partial automation of the FDA's import processing system, which has enabled the agency to improve its targeting of imported products -- particularly drugs and devices.
</P>

<P>
The new system is part of the Operational and Administrative System for Import Support (OASIS), which currently is awaiting full implementation (see &#182;912). OASIS enables the FDA to issue "may proceed" notices automatically for a majority of products, while focusing its attention on priority products at the U.S. ports of entry. 
</P>

<P>
Not surprisingly, the system appears to have dramatically cut down the number of product entries sampled by the FDA: During FY '95, the agency sampled 28,007 entries, 47 percent fewer than the 52,380 entries sampled during FY '94.
</P>

<P>
However, the total number of import detentions stayed relatively unchanged, and even increased for drugs and medical devices. Drug-related import detentions jumped by 26 percent to 5,646 and medical device detentions increased by 3 percent, to 6,426. Detentions of biological products jumped by nearly 150 percent, from 41 to 100. FDA sources indicated that automatic detentions -- without sampling of the product -- accounted for most of these increases. 
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Injunctions, Prosecutions and Seizures</H3>
</P>

<P>
The changes in routine FDA enforcement actions were not accompanied by dramatic change in the number of court cases brought during this time period, although the number of injunctions increased by roughly one-third, from 16 to 21. Prosecutions for criminal violations of the FD&amp;C Act stayed the same during FY '95 -- at eight -- as in the previous year. Seizure actions continued to fall, reaching an all-time low of 73.
</P>

<P>
Missing, however, from both injunctions and prosecutions in FY '95 and during the current year was the high-profile publicity that previously accompanied many such actions. In fact, the agency even canceled its quarterly publication of enforcement statistics and highlights, which had been published routinely since 1991.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Outlook</H3>
</P>

<P>
Although the recently released FDA figures offer some hope for industry that the FDA may be seeking less public forms of enforcement, few industry experts see any substantial change in the FDA's zealous pursuit of what it believes are serious deviations to its regulations.  
</P>

<P>
In fact, some experts believe that the FDA is even less predictable than in previous years, and may even be moving toward tighter regulation of drug and medical device manufacturing through more prescriptive, exacting GMP rules. At press time, no comprehensive data for 1996 had been released.
</P>

Examination</title>

<h2>Education, Preparation Are Keys To Surviving New Breed of SEC
Examination</h2><P>
<body>
<i>By Anthony R. Mansfield and Kevin M. Broadwater</i><p>

Registered investment advisers with more than $25 million in assets under

management can expect more frequent examinations from the Securities and

Exchange Commission, in the wake of the National Securities Markets Improvement

Act of 1996.<p>

The law, which was signed by President Clinton in October, handed over

inspection responsibility for investment advisers managing less than $25 million

in assets to the states, allowing SEC examiners to focus more attention on large

advisers (for more information on the law, see "President Signs Broad Regulatory

Reform Legislation To Eliminate Securities Overlaps," p. 1, November 1996).<p>

Preceding this shift in responsibility, SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections

and Examinations (OCIE) developed a new approach to investment adviser

inspections, targeting advisers that have a greater potential for

noncompliance.<p>

Under the new approach, OCIE may select specific areas for review based on its

assessment of the quality of a firm's compliance systems, rather than conducting

a traditional comprehensive examination that reviews every aspect of an

adviser's operations.<p>

Because OCIE is tailoring the scope of its examinations to the perceived

adequacy of an adviser's existing compliance system, advisers may wish to

re-examine their compliance policies to develop strategies that are designed to

show OCIE examiners that they have effective compliance procedures in place.

Following are some suggestions for investment advisers to use in preparing for

an OCIE examination.<p>

The logical first step in preparing for an examination is to ensure that

adequate compliance systems exist for all aspects of the adviser's operations.

This review should include a comprehensive examination of all policies and

procedures, with a view to ensuring that all required procedures are up to date

and reflect current regulatory interpretations.<p>

Advisers for mutual funds should re-evaluate their procedures and amend them if

necessary to reflect recent regulatory developments in areas such as personal

securities trading, aggregation of client orders with fund orders, and

amendments to Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. In addition,

advisers should ensure that any representations made as a condition for

no-action or exemptive relief are still accurate, and should review any

undertakings made as a condition for no-action or exemptive relief to determine

whether they have been effected and appropriately documented.<p>

Mutual fund advisers also should evaluate procedures for ensuring that the

fund's investment limits as stated in the prospectus are not exceeded. Finally,

advisers should review their recordkeeping and documentation requirements and

procedures. While this process may seem arduous and time-consuming, the time

spent reviewing and revising procedures in advance of an SEC inspection could

amount to time and money saved in doing the same work later, but under SEC

scrutiny.<p>

<h3>Role of Compliance Department</h3><p>

Another useful exercise is to review the way compliance is managed. Advisers

should periodically review the role of the compliance department in monitoring

operations to look for any weaknesses. Most investment advisers rely on the

legal or compliance department to handle compliance matters, but, quite often,

compliance matters are handled in a haphazard fashion. The time pressures of

managing compliance for a large fund combined with the potential for simple

human error means that compliance issues will sometimes be missed. A harried and

overburdened compliance staff will invite SEC scrutiny about its effectiveness

and possibly call into question all of an adviser's compliance efforts.<p>

In addition, the compliance department should look beyond day-to-day compliance

issues to focus on systemic compliance mechanisms. The review of the compliance

department should address questions such as: Is personal trading by investment

professionals effectively monitored? Are there written procedures for ensuring

that compliance functions are carried out? Are there clear lines of reporting

and responsibility for compliance personnel? Is there a way to monitor and

evaluate the effectiveness of the compliance department itself? Is the

compliance department adequately staffed with trained professionals?<p>

Resolution of these issues will produce a stronger compliance department that is

less likely to overlook potential violations, and will demonstrate to SEC that

the adviser takes its compliance responsibilities seriously.<p>

<h3>Role of Management Personnel</h3><p>

Because an adviser's management personnel may be among the first interviewed by

SEC examiners, it is important that they be involved in, or at least aware of,

the firm's compliance systems. Active involvement enables management to

understand the challenges faced by the compliance department and helps to foster

a compliance culture. The more distant management is from the operations of the

compliance department, the easier it is for investment professionals to remain

unconcerned about potential violations. OCIE examiners will look to see how

involved management is in compliance operations when assessing the overall

compliance culture of the adviser.<p>

Managing investment company and other client assets requires attention to

federal and state securities laws, tax laws, the Employee Retirement Income

Security Act, and other laws. The procedures established to comply with these

laws can be lengthy and complicated. Many advisers maintain a compliance manual

containing these procedures. However, it is still difficult for investment

professionals to remain up to date on every aspect of their operations.

Accordingly, the compliance department should conduct regular periodic

educational seminars to help keep their investment professionals current on

regulatory developments. These educational efforts should also be directed at

reminding the investment professionals of their obligations under applicable

laws and the firm's compliance procedures. A consistent educational effort

throughout the firm is one more way to show SEC that the adviser has an

appropriate regard for compliance.<p>

<h3>Mock Examinations</h3><p>

After the review of compliance procedures and the resolution of any potential

weaknesses in compliance monitoring or reporting, the adviser should determine

how best to demonstrate to SEC that its compliance controls are adequate. Many

advisers have engaged outside counsel to conduct mock examinations to give

senior management, portfolio managers and compliance personnel practice in

responding to SEC examiners. This process also serves to educate the adviser's

personnel on the firm's existing compliance procedures and the role of the

compliance department.<p>

Mock examinations are also an excellent way to test the compliance awareness of

the adviser's personnel. Weaknesses can easily be identified and immediately

corrected. As part of the mock examination, all individuals who are likely to be

interviewed by the SEC examiner should be instructed on how to respond to

questions. In addition, all personnel should be made aware of the value of

demonstrating the company's high regard for compliance. <p>

At the end of the mock examination process, the adviser's personnel should be

able to respond to the examiner's questions by referring to the appropriate

compliance procedure that governs his or her conduct. In this way, the adviser

is able to point out its compliance procedures and demonstrate that its

personnel are aware of the procedures. By having the adviser's personnel

highlight its compliance systems, the adviser may be able to limit the scope of

the SEC examination.<p>

<title>Industry Decries FDA Proposed Drug GMP Rule </title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/food/feds/fedshead.gif" alt="FDA Enforcement Manual">

<h2>Industry Decries FDA Proposed Drug GMP Rule </h2>

<P>
The FDA's proposed rule on good manufacturing practices (GMPs) for drugs suggests a new philosophy toward manufacturing controls that could result in far greater burdens and cost than current drug GMPs, according to industry comments on the May 3 proposed rule.
</P>

<P>
"PhRMA believes that the issues raised by this proposed rule represent such a radical departure from long-standing philosophy for [GMP] regulation that the proposal should be withdrawn," states the Pharmaceutical Researchers and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) in its comments. "This new approach with specific detailed requirements identified within the regulation, will inhibit the flexibility necessary to implement innovations and advances in manufacturing systems." 
</P>

<P>
"It is clear that the cost to comply with the proposed GMP revisions will be significantly more than the $2.9 million estimated in the Proposed Rule," states the Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association (GPIA) in its comments. "The cost for validating time limits for each phase of production alone could cost every firm hundreds of thousands of dollars."
</P>

<P>
The proposal, "Current Good Manufacturing Practices; Proposed Amendments of Certain Requirements for Finished Pharmaceuticals," creates more specific, detailed parameters for manufacturing controls of finished pharmaceuticals than exist today, with a particular emphasis on validation procedures (61 FR 20104; see "FDA Proposes Tighter GMP Controls," July 1996, p. 1). The comment period on the proposed rule closed Sept. 30.
</P>

<P>
"The main purpose for the change did concern process validation," John Dietrick of the Division of Manufacturing and Product Quality, within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), affirmed during a recent conference of the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society in Washington, D.C. Dietrick explained that although the proposed GMP rule encompasses far more than just validation, it was intended to provide new validation definitions and specific requirements for protocols, documentation and quality assurance (QA) approvals.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Blend Sample Sizes</H3>
</P>

<P>
Chief among the objectionable provisions identified by industry is the requirement under proposed 21 CFR &#167;211.110 that sampling and testing of in-process materials and drug products be based on unit dose samples.
</P>

<P>
"Unit dose sampling may not be appropriate or achievable," states the GPIA, explaining that the dynamic nature of powder blends makes for an "inexact science" when sampling, and thus unit dose sampling would likely lead to rejection of many good batches. Also, the methods proposed in the regulation would be inappropriate for dosage forms other than oral solids; for all products, testing of finished dosage forms would offer far more accurate results, argues GPIA.
</P>

<P>
Similarly, in its comments, PhRMA "strongly objects" to the unit dose sampling provision and questions its appropriateness within the regulation.
</P>

<P>
Although he acknowledged problems with this provision, the FDA's Dietrick did not say that the agency is prepared to completely abandon the concept of unit dose testing.
</P>

<P>
"We've probably gotten more comments on this than any other section," Dietrick said. "We prefer that sampling be small, near the dosage size, but we've received many comments that [this] is impossible for 15 to 20 percent of products.
</P>

<P>
"I still believe that [unit dose testing] should be done for these products when it does work," he added. "I'm only going to recommend that sampling be small enough to prevent masking nonuniformity and large enough to provide accurate results."
</P>

<P>
Dietrick added that a second requirement under proposed section 211.110 requiring that validation samples be representative of the blend is really intended "to allow sampling from either the blender or the drums," provided that a validated method is used.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Record Keeping</H3>
</P>

<P>
A second objectionable provision identified by commenters is proposed section 211.180, requiring manufacturers to maintain validation records, including validation batch records, for as long as the validated process is being used.
</P>

<P>
"The proposed language could be interpreted to require that all batch records associated with that process be retained as long as the validation records [are retained]," states PhRMA.
</P>

<P>
"Our intent was to require that validation records -- protocol, batch and testing records and the final report -- be maintained as long as that process is being used," Dietrick said, explaining this provision.
</P>

<P>
"Some of the comments indicated that this was being misunderstood to require that all batch records for all batches made with that validated system be maintained for that length of time," Dietrick added. "That's not what we meant to say, but if that's what is being interpreted then we'll have to change that."
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Definitions</H3>
</P>

<P>
Definitions in the proposed rule under proposed section 210.3 revise several existing terms and establish specific meanings for the first time for the following terms: validation protocol, process validation, methods validation, equipment suitability, process suitability and manufacturing process. 
</P>

<P>
In its comments, PhRMA objects to 10 of the definitions in the rule, including "validation protocol," "reworking," "manufacturing process," and "process suitability." In addition, PhRMA proposes that two new definitions be added, for "retrospective validation," and "change control" to delineate elements in the broad definition of manufacturing process used by the agency.
</P>

<P>
Although he did not mention specifics, Dietrick indicated that changes to the definitions may be forthcoming -- particularly to previously existing terms.
</P>

<P>
"We had a few comments on these, some of them expressing concern that we were changing definitions that had been used in the past," Dietrick said. "We didn't intend to do that -- we don't want to add more confusion to the process and we'll take a close look at it before it becomes final."
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>QC Responsibilities</H3>
</P>

<P>
Another key issue identified by commenters was the designation of the "quality control (QC) unit" as the principal unit responsible for assuring and overseeing validation efforts (proposed section 211.22).
</P>

<P>
"It appears that the FDA is not clearly defining the separation of [quality assurance] and [quality control] units," states the GPIA, explaining that the two functions must be delineated and provision made for conduct of validation by other company departments.
</P>

<P>
Dietrick explained that although the rule is intended to vest ultimate responsibility for validation with the QC unit, that does not mean that it is the only unit authorized to conduct validation.
</P>

<P>
"The comments on these are generally [concerning] the team approach to validation and sharing of responsibilities," he said. "We did not intend to say that all validation must be done by the QC unit -- we're only attempting to be consistent with other QC sections and give authority for final approval to QC."
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Maximum Time Limits</H3>
</P>

<P>
Another provision that sparked industry protests is a new requirement under proposed section 211.111 that manufacturers validate maximum time limits for completion of each phase of production, including storage, as part of process validation.
</P>

<P>
"Validating storage steps would place an undue burden on firms to either incorporate holding times during process validation or to place all these iterations up on stability," the GPIA argues. "We strongly believe that only critical, time-sensitive process phases require validation .... [T]imes for non-time-sensitive phases or between phases should not require validation, but should be required through overall time limits."
</P>

<P>
However, Dietrick did not indicate that the provision was perceived by FDA to represent a significant change from existing requirements.
</P>

<P>
"The existing [section] 211.111 now requires that firms establish time limits on production .... [T]his change only adds the requirement to validate those time limits," he said.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Outlook</H3>
</P>

<P>
Although Dietrick did not provide details of FDA deliberations on all provisions of the proposed rule, he did state that the agency intended to weigh the comments carefully before issuing a final rule. He offered no predictions on when the rule would be published.
</P>

<P>
Questions about the proposed rule can be directed to John Dietrick, (301) 594-0098, or via e-mail at: dietrickj@cder.fda.gov.

<P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>New Design Controls Come With One-year Enforcement Moratorium</H4>
</P>

<FONT SIZE="2"><P>
The FDA's quality systems final rule imposes new design control requirements on device manufacturers, but eases the compliance burden through a two-stage implementation process and a one-year moratorium on enforcement actions (61 FR 52602). 
</P>

<P>
In addition to imposing design control requirements, the new rule -- published Oct. 7 -- revises several aspects of the existing good manufacturing practice (GMP) regulations and harmonizes manufacturing control requirements with international standards. The quality systems rule "embraces the same 'umbrella' approach to the [GMP] regulation that is the underpinning of the original [GMP] regulation," according to its preamble. 
</P>

<P>
Although the rule will become effective June 1, 1997, enforcement of the design control provisions will not formally begin until June 1, 1998. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Enforcement Timetable</B>
</P>

<P>
Because of industry concerns about preparing their operations for the design control requirements, the FDA has decided to implement the final rule in two phases. As of June 1, 1997, all elements of the quality systems provisions of the final rule will become effective (stage one). However, as long as manufacturers "are taking reasonable steps to come into compliance," the FDA will implement a one-year transition period for design control requirements with a "mid-course review" (stage two). 
</P>

<P>
If a firm is not in compliance with the design control rules during stage one, the FDA will not take any official action (including recording observations on FDA Form 483s, the issuance of Warning Letters or the initiation of enforcement cases) (see &#182;339, Tab 400). Rather, the FDA investigator will issue observations of design control problems found during inspection on a separate "design control inspectional strategy report" that will become a part of the manufacturer's establishment inspection report. However, device manufacturers must take steps to come into compliance during stage one. 
</P>

<P>
To prepare for the phase-in of the design control requirements, the FDA plans to develop a design control inspection strategy by April 1997 and to hold training for industry and agency investigators. In December 1997, the FDA will review the findings from the first six months of inspections, including the design control strategy reports issued to manufacturers. 
</P>

<P>
In early 1998, the agency will hold a public meeting to discuss the findings and to further explore industry's concerns. The FDA also will review whether the final design control requirements "are appropriate to obtain the goals expressed" by the agency and may publish revisions if warranted. The FDA indicates it will extend the date for compliance with the rules if it determines more time is necessary for full implementation of the design control provisions.

<title>FDA Mulls Labeling for Free Glutamate Content</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/food/foodhead.gif" alt="Guide to U.S. Food Labeling Law"></center>
<P>
<h2>FDA Mulls Labeling for Free Glutamate Content</h2>

<P>
A recent scientific finding that monosodium glutamate (MSG) can cause adverse reactions (when eaten without food) has prompted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to consider establishing requirements for the labeling of foods with either MSG or other forms of free glutamates.
</P>

<P>
In an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in the Sept. 12 <I>Federal Register</I> (61 <I>FR</I> 48102), FDA says that the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) recently found that oral ingestion of three or more grams of MSG without [solid] food can cause adverse reactions in certain otherwise healthy individuals. (The full text of the notice is provided in this monthÕs update to the <I>Guide to U.S. Food Labeling Law</I> manual.)
</P>

<P>
The FASEB findings were based on an analysis of test data in which human subjects were given MSG or a placebo with either water or fruit juice. There were no available scientifically valid studies involving ingestion of MSG with solid foods, an FDA spokesperson said. She explained that although a [solid] food matrix might attenuate some of the effects of MSG, FDA feels that the non-[solid] food test results should be the baseline.
</P>

<P>
<H3>FDA Seeking Comments on Several Issues</H3>
</P>

<P>
Under current FDA regulations, when MSG is used as an ingredient in a food it must be declared in the ingredient statement. This is true even when MSG has been added indirectly as part of another ingredient (e.g., a spice blend that includes MSG).
</P>

<P>
The agency is seeking public comment on whether additional labeling requirements are necessary to protect glutamate-intolerant customers from adverse reactions and, if so, how such labeling should be implemented. FDA is also seeking comments on establishing formal criteria for the use of claims regarding the absence of MSG to ensure that labels bearing such claims are not misleading.  It also seeks feedback on whether such criteria should be based on a defined threshold level of free glutamate in a finished food, on the ingredients used in the food, or both.
</P>

<P>
While MSG is the most well-known and widely used form of free glutamate for enhancing the flavor of foods, other salts of free glutamate, such as monopotassium glutamate and monoammonium glutamate, also have flavor-enhancing properties. In addition to MSG, glutamic acid, glutamic acid hydrochloride, monoammonium glutamate, and monopotassium glutamate all must be declared in ingredients statements as well. For this reason, FDA considers foods whose labels say ÒNo MSGÓ or ÒNo added MSGÓ to be misleading if the food contains ingredients that are sources of free glutamates, such as hydrolyzed protein.
</P>

<P>
<H3>Label Declarations for Free Glutamate</H3>
</P>

<P>
Free glutamate occurs naturally in various foods and in food substances that are used as finished foods, or it can be produced by hydrolysis of proteins, in which case the presence of free glutamate in the food is not required to be declared on the label under existing regulations. Naturally occurring free glutamate is not required to be declared in the ingredient statement because it is not an added ingredient; rather, it is a natural constituent of the food, like protein or a vitamin. 
</P>

<P>
Similarly, when a food that contains naturally occurring free glutamate is used as an ingredient in another food, the free glutamate is not required to be declared in the ingredient statement of the finished food. Rather, the ingredient containing the free glutamate is declared in the ingredient statement by its common or usual name. 
</P>

<P>
This policy that it is the ingredients and not the constituents of a food that must be declared also applies when a food that contains free glutamate produced by protein hydrolysis is used as an ingredient in another food. (An ingredient is defined as a substance used to fabricate a food: for example, chocolate might include such  ingredients as chocolate liqueur, sugar, and milk. A constituent is defined as a naturally occurring part of an ingredient. A constituent of milk, for example, would be lactose.) In that situation too, the glutamate-containing ingredient must be declared in the ingredient statement of the finished food, but free glutamate need not be declared as an ingredient. 
</P>

<P>
Because the average consumer is unaware that free glutamate is essentially equivalent to MSG, or that ingredients like hydrolyzed soy protein, autolyzed yeast extract, tomato paste, and parmesan cheese contain free glutamate, declaration of these ingredients by their common or usual names does not indicate to the consumer that an MSG-like substance is present in the food.
</P>

<P>
<H3>Hidden Ingredients</H3>
</P>

<P>
A number of consumers, particularly those with an adverse reaction to MSG, have told FDA they believe that manufacturers use ingredients such as hydrolyzed protein and autolyzed yeast expressly to add free glutamate to a food while hiding its presence.
</P>

<P>
Until recently, FDA felt that the scientific literature did not provide a public health basis on which to impose special labeling requirements for such ingredients or for foods that contain free glutamate. In light of recent findings of the Life Sciences Research Office of FASEB, however, FDA is reconsidering the need for labeling to inform individuals who experience adverse reactions to glutamate about its presence in a food.
</P>

<P>
The FASEB study indicated that an unknown percentage of the population might react to MSG and develop MSG symptom complex, a condition characterized by one or more of the following symptoms:
</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Burning sensation in the back of the neck, forearms, and chest;<BR>
	<LI>Numbness in the back of the neck, radiating to the arms and back;<BR>
	<LI>Tingling, warmth and weakness in the face, temples, upper back, neck, and arms;<BR>
	<LI>Facial pressure or tightness;<BR>
	<LI>Chest pain;<BR>
	<LI>Headache;<BR>
	<LI>Nausea;<BR>
	<LI>Rapid heartbeat;<BR>
	<LI>Bronchospasm (difficulty breathing) in MSG-intolerant people with asthma;<BR>
	<LI>Drowsiness; and <BR>
	<LI>Weakness.
</UL>

<P>
Comments should be sent by Nov. 11, 1996 to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA 305), Food and Drug Administration, 12420 Parklawn Drive, rm. 1-23, Rockville, MD, 20857.

<title>Quality Systems Final Rule Is Issued, Goes Into Effect June 1997</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<P>
<h2>Quality Systems Final Rule Is Issued, Goes Into Effect June 1997</h2>

<P>
Following several years of debate and refinement, the quality systems concept became a reality on Oct. 7, when the FDA published the medical device quality systems final rule in the <I>Federal Register</I> (61 FR 52602, see App. II, App. III). The quality systems final rule incorporates elements of the existing good manufacturing practice (GMP) regulation, harmonizes manufacturing control requirements with international standards, and imposes new design control requirements on manufacturers of new device products. 
</P>

<P>
The FDA published a proposed rule in November 1993 and released to the public a revised working draft final rule in July 1995. The final rule's preamble addresses hours of public debate and hundreds of industry comments on those versions, and strives to respond to criticisms that the previous incarnations were too prescriptive.
</P>

<P>
"The agency's final rule embraces the same 'umbrella' approach to the [GMP] regulation that is the underpinning of the original [GMP] regulation," the preamble to the final rule states (61 FR 52606, see App. III). "Because this regulation must apply to so many different types of devices, the regulation does not prescribe in detail how a manufacturer must produce a specific device." 
</P>

<P>
Although the entire rule will become effective June 1, 1997, enforcement of the design control provisions will not formally begin until June 1, 1998. 
</P>

<P>
<H3>Background</H3>
</P>

<P>
The addition of design controls "will save lives and will greatly reduce the risks from unrecognized design flaws," according to an FDA "Talk Paper" issued Oct. 4. The FDA was authorized to require preproduction design controls by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990. This change was prompted by studies conducted by the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services' Inspector General (IG), which found that a significant number of device problems could be attributed to inadequate design controls. 
</P>

<P>
Specifically, the FDA found that approximately 44 percent of quality problems leading to voluntary device recalls could be attributed to errors or deficiencies that were designed into the products, and could have been prevented by adequate design controls. The IG's study report cited similar problems, and found that the percentage of design-related problems was even higher for software used to operate medical devices.
</P>

<P>
"A subsequent study of software-related recalls for the period of fiscal year (FY) 1983 through FY 1991 indicated that over 90 percent of all software-related device failures were due to design-related errors, generally, the failure to validate software prior to routine production," the preamble states (see "Design Controls and Software Are a Good Mix ..." p. 6).
</P>

<P>
<H3>Two Major Changes</H3>
</P>

<P>
The two primary changes implemented as the quality systems rule made its way through the rulemaking process are related to the scope of the new rule: whether or not component manufacturers are covered by the rule, and whether or not the definition of manufacturers includes servicers and refurbishers. 
</P>

<P>
Many industry members had objected to the application of the rule to component manufacturers because they feared doing so would increase product costs, provide limited added value and lead many component manufacturers to discontinue supplying the device industry (see "Manufacturers Express Common Concerns ...," October 1995, p. 1). The agency indicated last year that it would be willing to delete this requirement provided that all safety issues were being addressed elsewhere in the regulation. The preamble to the final rule states that purchasing controls and acceptance requirements (new 21 CFR &#167;&#167;820.50, 820.80), see App. II) "are sufficient to provide the needed assurance that suppliers, contractors and consultants have adequate controls to produce acceptable components." 
</P>

<P>
Accordingly, the agency has removed the provision requiring component manufacturers to be covered by the quality systems rule. 
</P>

<P>
Further, the FDA was unable to reach consensus regarding whether or not servicers and refurbishers should be treated as manufacturers under the regulation. At the GMP Advisory Committee meeting in September 1995, the committee was sharply divided on this issue. The agency chose to exclude this provision from the final rule and "elected to address application of the ... requirements to persons who provide servicing and refurbishing functions outside the control of the original manufacturer in a separate rulemaking later this year, with another opportunity for public comment." 
</P>

<P>
<H3>Enforcement Timetable</H3>
</P>

<P>
Based on industry concerns about changing their operations in preparation for the new requirements -- especially design control requirements -- the FDA has decided to implement the final rule in two phases. As of June 1, 1997, all elements of the quality systems final rule will become effective. However, provided that manufacturers "are taking reasonable steps to come into compliance," the FDA will implement a one-year transition period for design control requirements with a mid-course review (see "CDRH Holds Workshop ...," October 1996, p. 5). 
</P>

<P>
During the first phase -- from June 1997 until June 1998 -- the FDA will not take any official action (including observations on FDA Form 483s, the issuance of Warning Letters or the initiation of enforcement cases), if a firm is not yet in compliance with the design control requirements. Rather, the FDA investigator will issue observations of design control problems found during inspection on "a separate design control inspectional strategy report." 
</P>

<P>
The design control inspectional strategy report will become a part of the manufacturer's establishment inspection report, but the observations relating to design control requirements "will not be included in any [W]arning [L]etters or regulatory actions during this initial one-year period," the preamble states.
</P>

<P>
The FDA reminds industry that it is required to take steps to come into compliance during this period, and that the agency "can, at any time, take action against unsafe or adulterated medical devices under different regulatory or statutory requirements." 
</P>

<P>
To prepare for the phase-in of design controls, the FDA intends to develop a design control inspection strategy by April 1997, with training held for industry and agency investigators during April and May of next year. 
</P>

<P>
<H3>Mid-course Review Results</H3>
</P>

<P>
In December 1997, the FDA will review the design control findings resulting from the first six months of inspections, including the strategy reports given to manufacturers during this period. Reports will be reviewed to determine the following:
</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<P>
	<LI>Clarity of information obtained;
</P>
<P>
	<LI>Appropriateness of collected information regarding design control requirements;
</P>
<P>
	<LI>Appropriateness of the inspectional strategy questions;
</P>
<P>
	<LI>Manner in which investigators are writing out their obligations; and
</P>
<P>
	<LI>Any requirements that appear to be problematic for manufacturers or where there might be confusion regarding what the regulation requires. 
</P>
</UL>

<P>
In early 1998, the agency intends to hold a public meeting to discuss the findings from this review and further explore industry's concerns. Additional public meetings, workshops or training sessions could be held following that meeting. At that point, the FDA also will be reviewing whether or not the final design control requirements "are appropriate to obtain the goals expressed" by the agency, and could publish revisions based on this review. 
</P>

<P>
In addition, the FDA indicates that if it determines that either the agency or the industry needs more time to fully implement the design control provisions, the agency will extend the implementation date for compliance with these requirements. 
</P>
<HR>

<P>
<CENTER><H4>Compliance With New Quality Systems Rule Can Be Good and Bad, Industry Rep Says</H4>
</CENTER></P>

<FONT SIZE="2"><P>
As the quality systems final rule becomes a reality, many companies are seeing only the downside, such as added costs, more paperwork and less decision control, according to Robert Bard, vice president of regulatory and legal affairs at I-Flow Corp.
</P>

<P>
However, device regulatory affairs managers also should recognize the upside of the new rule, because it provides them with better controls over other departments (such as research and development), a bridge to international harmonization, a rationale for hiring more support staff and, ultimately, a higher quality product to support. 
</P>

<P>
"Some requirements tell us we need to do things differently from ISO 9000, differently than we do it today," Bard told attendees of a Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society meeting. "Although the new rule includes 30 modified definitions and requires at least 50 documents, we do a lot of this [document generation] already." 
</P>

<P>
However, Bard also predicted that the new rule would bring about the "death of small start-ups" that "operate on a shoestring," because it will be difficult for a two- to five-person company to "survive the sum total" of all the new requirements.  
</P>

<P>
Larger companies may need more people, incur more costs and experience slower product development times, but should be able, with the help of consultants as needed, to ride out the changes the new rule brings, Bard said.

<title>CDRH Seeks Input on Device Software Policy That Promotes Industry</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/xray/xrayhead.gif" alt="Guide to Medical Device Regulation"></center>
<P>
<h2>CDRH Seeks Input on Device Software Policy That Promotes Industry</h2>

<P>
Recognizing that the state-of-the-art for medical device software "has moved past" FDA efforts, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is looking to the medical device and software industries for insight on the best way to regulate this product area, according to CDRH Director Bruce Burlington, who spoke at a recent public workshop held in Bethesda, Md.
</P>

<P>
"We believe that by working with you at this stage, where our ideas are just beginning to form, that regulators, regulated industry and users can come up with a rational and reasonable approach that will protect the public health, as well as promote the development of a vigorous industry," Burlington told attendees of the Sept. 3-4 workshop co-sponsored by the FDA and the National Library of Medicine. Burlington admitted that the regulation of software is "a conundrum" for the agency.
</P>

<P>
"We want to understand where software is a medical device and where the public and public health protection will be achieved by the exercise of regulatory controls that [apply] to medical devices," he said. To date, the FDA essentially has concluded that if software has an intended use that relates to health care, particularly in the area of diagnostic decision-making, it is a device (see &#182;233).
</P>

<P>
However, because the FDA's approach to regulating devices is risk-based, Burlington explained that the agency does not wish to exercise controls where a device poses no hazards. However, if a device is part of an overall diagnosis process, then that product must be regulated, he said. Such high-risk devices would include computer-assisted diagnostic devices, automated test systems (such as those that determine which specimens need human review and which do not) and radiation therapy planning systems. 
</P>

<P>
"We need your help," Burlington said. "We need information on what can and what has gone wrong. Without information on the risks of software ... we will not be able to apply rational and proportionate controls that will serve our purpose of protecting the public health." 
</P>

<P>
Stressing that the agency "has to get the answer right," Burlington called on industry to help the agency categorize products according to risk to public health, and to help establish "bright lines" and clear decision points that lead to classification levels and the regulatory controls that apply to them. 
</P>

<P>
Although the agency set forth three major topics for discussion -- classification and risk-based criteria, alternatives to premarket notification requirements for certain medical software, including a "software quality audit" concept, and distribution issues related to software commercialization -- classification tops the FDA's priority list, according to agency officials. 
</P>

<P>
"We need to be able to identify and classify those low-end products to exempt them, because unless they are ... classified and exempt by regulation, they are ... subject to all requirements, " said Harvey Rudolph, deputy director of CDRH's Office of Science and Technology. "So we have to go through the classification process ... because the sooner we deal with it, the better it will set us up for the future," he said.

Although no time frame for issuing a new software policy has been set, the agency plans to address emerging issues "as best we can" during the "next 12 months" and develop a proposed policy, Rudolph said (see "Device Software Policy: Years in the Making," below). It is anticipated that the agency will hold additional workshops to discuss software issues.

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><CENTER>Device Software Policy: Years in the Making</CENTER></H4> 

<FONT SIZE="2"><P>
Although medical software technology has become more complex and part of significantly more medical device products during the past seven years, regulated industry has been stuck with an FDA draft software policy that was last revised in 1989, a situation that was described in 1994 by an FDA official as "distasteful," and which may continue in the months ahead while the agency formulates the new policy.
</P>

<P>
Because of the increased complexity and prevalence of medical software and a lack of updated guidance since 1989, the FDA, software manufacturers and health care practitioners have "misunderstood or misinterpreted the provisions and exemptions" in the current policy, according to a "points of discussion" document issued by the agency in preparation for a public workshop held Sept. 3-4 in Bethesda, Md. (see "CDRH Seeks Input on Device Software Policy," p. 1). 
</P>

<P>
The 1989 draft policy informally described a program to limit FDA's regulatory reach over software. Specifically, the draft policy identified jurisdictional limitations over software and described a number of exemptions, including several exemptions that were not the result of rule making and, therefore, had no legal effect. Nonetheless, the agency has followed this draft policy's provisions for seven years. 
</P>

<P>
For devices subject to FDA regulation, the 1989 draft policy states that all medical software is subject to adulteration and misbranding provisions of the Federal Food, Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act) (21 USC &#167;&#167;351, 352, see App. I), that most devices would be subject only to these provisions, and that some devices would fall under good manufacturing practice regulations (21 CFR &#167;820, see App. II) and also need premarket notifications (510(k)s). 
</P>

<P>
The FDA's device regulations and authorities do not apply to software that is intended to perform traditional "library" functions (i.e., those storage, retrieval and dissemination functions carried out using medical textbooks and journals) or software that performs general accounting, communications or educational functions that do not affect the diagnosis or treatment of patients. General purpose software, software used in nonclinical research and software that is altered by a practitioner for use in his or her own practice also is exempt from the regulations. However, all other software -- including components and accessories -- are regulated by the FDA. 
</P>

<P>
Software components and accessories are regulated in the same manner and to the same degree as the parent device. In FDA's workshop document the agency identifies a component as integral parts of such devices as infusion pumps, pacemakers and magnetic resonance imaging devices. 
</P>

<P>
In identifying software accessories, the FDA has determined that if the software is specified or intended for use with a classified device, or directly interfaces with another device for transfer of data to and from the other device, the software is an accessory. Software for calculation of rate response for a cardiac pacemaker, for off-line analysis of electroencephalogram data or for radiation treatment planning would be considered regulated software. 
</P>

<P>
The FDA had promised to issue a new software policy by the end of 1994, which was slated to re-evaluate FDA's regulation of "stand-alone software (i.e., software that is neither a component nor a part of a medical device) and delete the 1989 "competent human intervention" provision which stated that unclassified software that can be overridden by health professionals is exempt from 510(k) requirements (see "Revised CDRH Software Policy ...," June 1994, p. 7). 
</P>

<P>
The "competent human intervention" exemption was intended to apply to medical software that generated data that could be interpreted and, if necessary, overridden by, a health professional. However, this provision has been misinterpreted to apply to all medical software devices, including any device that simulates artificial intelligence and stores and compresses data -- such as diagnostic X-ray systems or other radiological diagnostic products -- unless previously classified.
</P>

<P>
In January 1996, the FDA held a meeting to discuss a three-tiered classification approach for computer-aided diagnostic devices. Harvey Rudolph, deputy director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health's Office of Science and Technology, explained the challenges of this approach at the Jan. 26 meeting. 
</P>

<P>
Although low-risk products exempt from review would fall into the bottom category and high-risk devices subject to premarket approval or 510(k) requirements would be placed in the top category, he said that the most challenging obstacle would be defining the criteria for moderate-risk products that possibly could be reviewed under a third-party certification process (see "FDA Renews Effort for Device Software Policy ...," March 1996, p. 4).

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><CENTER>Better Defining Software Risk Criteria</CENTER></H4>

<FONT SIZE="2"><P>
To help identify risks associated with a medical device software product, as part of a software classification process, the FDA held discussions with several trade associations prior to its September software policy workshop. These discussions yielded the following criteria, with examples, for the FDA to consider when making classification decisions about software products. Participants at a September workshop to address software regulation complained that the criteria often only made sense for the specific example cited.
</P>

<UL>
<P>
	<LI>The seriousness of the particular disease or condition which the medical software device is intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent and how the software contributes to the user's decision making for diagnosis or clinical management of the patient.
</P>
	
<P>
	<B>Example:</B> Software designed to call attention to imminent hazard conditions in an intensive care unit would be placed in a higher classification level than software that provides long-term storage for diagnostic radiologic information.
</P>
	
<P>
	<LI>The amount of time available before using the information provided by the medical software device, i.e., the time until a therapeutic or additional diagnostic intervention must be implemented by the health care provider after the results of the software have been provided.
</P>
	
<P>
	<B>Example:</B> An EKG reading and analysis package device whose output is "SHOCK NOW" may be placed in a higher class than a device that provides a proposed reading with a notation that the rhythm itself should be checked.
</P>
	
<P>
	<LI>Whether the data output is provided or manipulated in a novel or nontraditional manner or whether decision trees within the software depart from customary use.
</P>
	
<P>
	<B>Example:</B> If the system's algorithms, parameters, internal decision trees or other output manipulations depart from customary use it may be regulated differently than if it results in a traditional data presentation.
</P>
	
<P>
	<LI>Whether the software device provides individualized patient care recommendations.
</P>
	
<P>
	<B>Example:</B> If the software provides general advice or information, like a library, article or textbook, it may be placed in a lower class than software designed to provide a specific recommendation for a specific patient.
</P>
	
<P>
	<LI>Whether the mechanism by which the software device arrives at a decision is hidden or transparent.
</P>
	
<P>
	<B>Example:</B> If the limitations on the process are made known to the user, such as data contraction, deletion, editing or simplification, this may affect classification. Also, the methods used to make comparisons to normative databases and the ways normative databases are created may be factors in classification. 
</P>
	
<P>
	<LI>Does the product provide new capabilities for the user?
</P>
</UL>

<P>
Although the FDA has indicated that it has not yet determined how the criteria would be applied in an objective and consistent way during classification, it is attempting to gather risk information that will help resolve classification issues. The FDA sought public comment during the workshop regarding whether or not any or all of these criteria are necessary to assess risk, if these criteria are comprehensive enough to assess risk, and how the criteria should be combined in a model to limit potential risk to patients. However, no consensus was reached and it is likely the FDA will hold additional workshops on specific issues in the future.

 Compliance Handbook"></center><P>

<h3>Special Report</h3><P>
<h2> RBOC entry into video fraught with regulatory conflicts</h2>
It's been generally smooth sailing for the regional Bell operating companies
(RBOCs) in implementing their video service business plans: Ameritech has been
awarded 25 cable franchises; BellSouth has bought wireless cable properties and
is beginning to build full service networks; US West bought Continental
Cablevision; and PacTel, NYNEX and Bell Atlantic are constructing digital
wireless cable systems and broadband networks. By all indicators, competition
between RBOC and cable video services is beginning to emerge in pockets across
the country.<P>

But the most intense battles between the RBOCs and the cable industry may reside
more in the FCC and the courts than in the marketplace. That's because major
legal issues still need to be resolved before regulation can recede into the
background and competition can move to the forefront. <P>

The issue raising the most ire with the cable industry is the potential by RBOCs
for cross-subsidization, in which revenue from telephone ratepayers is used to
finance the construction of video service networks. Relatedly, the cable industry
advocates stringent cost allocation rules to ensure that RBOCs cannot
cross-subsidize. <P>

While the RBOCs and cable industry seem satisfied with the general principles of
the 1996 act, the details are still being ironed out in FCC proceedings and
federal courts. For example, the FCC has yet to release new cost allocation rules
and the commission's telephony interconnection order is stuck in federal court.
<P>

<h3><i>Charges of cross-subsidization</i></h3><P>

Accusations of cross-subsidization have been hurled at the RBOCs every time they
launch a new video service project. Because telephony is a much more lucrative
business than video programming distribution, the National Cable Television
Association (NCTA) has been vigilant in trying to ensure that the RBOCs not
engage in "anticompetitive conduct" by adding costs onto telephone rates to pay
for new video services. <P>

The 1996 act states that "a telecommunications carrier may not use services that
are not competitive to subsidize services that are competitive." But until all of
the regulatory protections are in place, the cable industry will not breathe any
easier. <P>

"It's irrational for telephone companies to not want to cross-subsidize," said
David Nicoll, an attorney with NCTA. The reason: telephone rates are currently
inflated, he said, providing RBOCs with plenty of excess revenue. Nicoll said
rates would be lower if phone competition truly existed, and cited the fact that
the FCC's recommended rates in its interconnection order are significantly lower
than RBOCs' current telephone rates. This, he contends, makes it difficult for
RBOCs to resist using revenue from telephone ratepayers, especially since a
substantial percentage exceeds the actual cost of providing telephone service.<P>

A representative from the United States Telephone Association was unavailable for
comment on these issues.<P>

Another cable-related concern is how to allocate costs for excess capacity
already constructed by telcos and new RBOC networks that can carry both voice and
video. NCTA has contended that "local telephone companies appear to have
constructed substantial excess capacity in anticipation of offering video
transmission," adding that the "costs of excess capacity should not be borne by
telephone ratepayers."<P>

A case in point is the conflict between BellSouth and Georgia and Tennessee cable
operators, which features many of the elements instigating conflict between RBOCs
and cable over video service: accusations of cross-subsidization, built-out
excess video capacity, unconventional cable franchising and claims of
discriminatory behavior. <P>

The Georgia and Tennessee cable operators have accused BellSouth of subsidizing
its entry into video service by:<P>
<UL><P>
<LI>laying excess co-axial cable without a franchise and paying for it from
telephone revenue;<P>
<LI>overcharging for services such as caller-ID and call-waiting in order to
subsidize video services; and<P>
<LI>discriminating against cable operators by overcharging for conduit and
pole-attachment space and foreclosing equal access to conduit space by favoring
its own video service.</UL><P>

This case illustrates the difficult issues still to be resolved surrounding the
RBOC entry into video. Most important, it could force BellSouth to justify its
expenditures on video services and set a precedent for how all RBOCs justify
video service investments. Also, the conflict makes clear that there still is no
guidance from the FCC on how telephone profits are defined and how these profits
can be used to build video systems. What's more, the commission may have to
establish complex accounting and monitoring mechanisms to avoid these types of
accusations in the future. <P>

<h3><i>Waiting on cost allocation</i></h3><P>

For Steve Effros, president of the Cable Telecommunications Association (CATA),
the cost allocation issue tops all of his concerns about RBOC entry into video
service. "We can't compete with what is still a monopoly service," he said,
adding that "the FCC has promised for four years ... to complete cost allocation
rules." <P>

As an example, the current open video system rulemaking is mired in conflict over
the issue of potential cross-subsidization. The FCC was supposed to complete OVS
cost allocation rules by October, but the complexity of the undertaking and RBOC
opposition to the proposed rules led to their postponement.<P>

While not opposing Bell Atlantic's OVS certification request for Dover Township,
N.J., (see November 1996 Monthly Bulletin, Page 11) NCTA believes it is
inappropriate to certify OVS providers without first having cost allocation rules
in place. According to NCTA, "cost allocation rules are essential to protect
consumers and competitors against anticompetitive cross-subsidy." <P>

In a brief on the issue to the FCC, NCTA said, "So long as the incumbent local
exchange carrier's telephone monopolies continue, the risk continues that
telephone rates in excess of costs will be used to subsidize video services, and
telephone customers will become unwilling contributors to an incumbent local
exchange carrier's anti-competitive strategy." <P>

The New Jersey Cable Telecommunications Association (NJCTA) claimed Bell Atlantic
is subsidizing its Dover Township system with revenue from telephone ratepayers.
In a brief filed with the FCC, NJCTA said, "If the commission does nothing, it
will allow tens of millions of dollars to slip into regulated telephone accounts
undetected." To this end, NJCTA requested that the FCC investigate how investment
capital allocated to the OVS system is assigned. <P>

NCTA's Nicoll said the only way to monitor telco cross-subsidization is to do an
audit. That aside, the challenge for the FCC is to determine how to allocate
common costs associated with facilities that can provide both voice and video
linking the telephone company's central office to customers. The cable industry
has suggested that telco expenditures should be governed by a fixed allocation
factor in which some percentage of the plant is allocated to each service. Under
this scheme, if 50 percent of the costs of the integrated network are for
telephone service, then 50 percent of the cost of the video portion of the
network could be subsidized by revenues from the telephone users of the network.
<P>

Another possible solution is to require that RBOCs offer video service in a
separate subsidiary from their telephony operations, including for OVS. The cable
industry contends that structural separation is necessary because telcos have a
strong incentive to misallocate costs associated with video programming services.
Furthermore, the cable industry claims, accounting safeguards can only go so far.
According to Leland Johnson, a consultant for NCTA, "the separate affiliate
requirement would help ensure that 'hidden' transactions do not occur between the
parent and the affiliate." <P>

And NCTA has also told the FCC that "structural separation is important in OVS
because certain telephone companies have previously announced plans to invest
billions of dollars in integrated plant," making "the separate subsidiary tool
absolutely essential to aid in the detection of cost and resource
misallocations." <P>

John Seiver, an attorney with the Washington, D.C., firm of Cole, Raywid &amp;
Braverman, which represents Georgia and Tennessee cable operators in their
complaint against BellSouth, said the cable industry needs to be aware that cost
allocation issues extend to any case where there is the possibility of joint
facilities being used, including wireless cable facilities.<P>

Seiver contends that the legal delays in implementing the interconnection order
could further tilt the advantage in favor of the RBOCs. "The playing field is
clearly skewed because it's easier for telcos to get into video than it is for
cable to get into telephony," he said. Seiver added that the impact local
franchisers could potentially have on competition between telcos and cable
operators should not be underestimated. <P>

This has to do with how municipalities award telecommunications franchises.
Seiver points to the conflict in Kansas between Classic Telephone, an MSO, and
the Kansas towns of Hill City and Bogue. Classic, which Seiver represents,
applied for a telecommunications franchise to be the second telephony provider,
but was denied because the towns preferred to have only one service provider. The
FCC has ordered both towns to grant a franchise to Classic (see this issue, page
7). According to Seiver, the damage has already been done. "The longer a local
government delays granting a franchise, the more opportunity the local monopoly
telephone company has to take subscribers and siphon off revenue before the cable
operator can enter the market," he said, adding that local governments "will do
whatever they want to on this issue." <P>

CATA's Effros would eliminate all local power to regulate telecommunications and
give it to the states, which regulate the RBOCs. "The states are supposed to
regulate telephony and the 1996 act said cities couldn't do it," Effros said. "If
cable has to negotiate with 14,000 cities to get into telecommunications
services, it is at a severe disadvantage to DBS and telcos," he said, adding that
"we won't see facilities-based competition if cities are allowed to regulate
cable telephony." <P>

Another issue of concern for cable operators and local governments alike is the
accusation by Georgia and Tennessee cable operators that BellSouth is
"cherry-picking" franchises by first laying co-axial cable in only the most
affluent areas without getting a cable franchise. RBOCs could potentially create
de facto cable systems in affluent areas by laying co-axial cable first, and then
telling local governments it will only serve the areas where it has laid cable.
<P>

<h3><i>Joint marketing restrictions?</i></h3><P>

Another issue related to cross-subsidization will be the possible restrictions on
how the RBOCs can market voice and video services.<P>

The 1996 act is silent on the issue of the joint marketing of telephone and video
programming services. The RBOCs do not want the FCC to impose any marketing
restrictions. Nor do they want regulators to determine the manner and degree in
which video service is bundled with other services. <P>

NCTA has advocated to the FCC that RBOCs should be prevented from referring
customers to their video divisions unless they provide the same service to
competing cable operators. "When a new resident enters a new community, one of
the first things to do is call the phone company to get phone service," said
David Nicoll. "Phone companies will get an unfair advantage if they can also
offer video service when it has a monopoly over an essential service like
telephony." <P>

Nicoll said joint marketing restrictions should be lifted only when there is
competition in a local telephone market from another telephony provider. Effros
agreed, adding that restrictions have to exist since "abuse could be so easy."
<P>

Effros also believes that restrictions on the bundling of services is the only
fair way to realize effective competition. "RBOCs should have to wait until
everyone can bundle video and voice, in which all competitors are not foreclosed
from entering telephony," he said, adding that "effective competition should go
both ways -- telcos should not be allowed into cable until cable can get into
their business." <P>

<h3><i>Pole and conduit attachments</i></h3><P>

The 1996 act requires incumbent telephone companies offering video services to
impute the rates for pole attachments and conduit facilities to their costs of
providing video service. This means that phone rates should be reduced, according
to the NCTA, because RBOCs can only charge for use of a pole based on their own
use of it for telephone service -- not what it costs them to offer both video and
telephone service on the pole. <P>

A major concern for cable is to ensure access to all poles and conduits. NCTA's
Nicoll said since "cable companies don't have the same access to poles that
utilities do, we're concerned that pole attachments are always available on just,
reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms." <P>

As part of the complaint he filed for the Tennessee and Georgia cable operators,
Seiver claims BellSouth is opening trenches to lay co-axial cable without
notifying local cable. Notification is important, Seiver said, because when a
telco gives access to its easements, it is supposed to be open to everybody. In
addition, Seiver said BellSouth was charging $6 when the true cost should be 30
cents. <P>

CATA's Effros said the key issue is for the cable industry to simply enforce FCC
rules prohibiting telcos from discriminating against cable operators. "The RBOCs
are not allowed to discriminate, but they're doing it," he said, citing an
ongoing case in which Ohio cable operators have charged Ameritech with violating
pole attachment regulations.<P>

Warning Letters Take Back Seat to NOVs on DDMAC's Enforcement
Agenda</title></head>
<body>
<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<P>

<h2> 
Warning Letters Take Back Seat to NOVs on DDMAC's Enforcement Agenda</h2>
<P>

Warning Letters no longer represent the FDA's primary enforcement tool for
advertising and promotion violations by pharmaceutical manufacturers, according
to Minnie Baylor-Henry, acting director of the Division of Drug Marketing,
Advertising and Communications (DDMAC) within the Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research (CDER).<P>

"Companies need guidance, not more Warning Letters," she said, signaling a shift
in DDMAC's enforcement methods and a philosophical departure from other CDER and
FDA divisions (see &#182;912).<P>

Although the division will continue to issue Warning Letters when appropriate,
DDMAC is re-examining how it communicates policy initiatives to the drug
industry, Baylor-Henry told attendees at a Feb. 26 conference. Her office
intends to follow the full notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures of the
Administrative Procedures Act and is "not going to let Warning Letters be the
first statement of policy" on an advertising and promotion issue, she
promised.<P>

The agency issued no Warning Letters for drug promotion violations in calendar
year 1995, reflecting a steady downward trend in the number issued since 1992
(see &#182;930). Similarly, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health has
issued fewer Warning Letters each year since 1993, though the yearly totals
remain significantly higher than those issued for drugs (see &#182;950). The
Center for Biologics Research and Evaluation also has issued fewer Warning
Letters for violations of its advertising policies (see &#182;940).<P>

<h3>Preventive Advice<P></h3>

Speaking at a Drug Information Association meeting in New York, Baylor-Henry
characterized 1996 as a "period of reflection at DDMAC." Her division is in the
process of re-evaluating all of the guidelines it issued since 1970 and has
found that many of them are outdated. DDMAC also plans to improve communications
with drug companies by emphasizing cooperation over enforcement, Baylor-Henry
said.<P>

In that spirit, DDMAC sent out 767 advisory letters in response to
manufacturers' requests for comments on launch campaigns, press releases,
continuing medical education programs and other marketing materials during
fiscal year 1995, she told attendees. This represents a 14 percent increase in
such letters over fiscal year 1994, Baylor-Henry reported. Baylor-Henry
emphasized that the submission of launch materials for preclearance is not
mandatory, but noted that DDMAC is willing to review a launch campaign as a
proactive approach to compliance with FDA regulations (see &#182;412).<P>

Despite efforts to work with drug manufacturers to ensure compliance, DDMAC sent
out 163 Notices of Violation (NOVs) in fiscal year 1995, Baylor-Henry said. NOVs
generally are issued for violations viewed as not serious enough to warrant a
Warning Letter, but serious enough to warrant an official record. They include a
description of the alleged violation, a statement of the actions DDMAC regards
as appropriate remedies, and a time period for the company to respond with its
intentions to correct the alleged violation. Unlike Warning Letters, which are
signed by the district director, NOVs are signed by the individual reviewer and
are not made public (see &#182;911).<P>

Baylor-Henry noted that recent NOVs have mandated corrective actions within a
specific time period -- a tactic previously reserved for Warning Letters.<P>

<h3>Violation Patterns<P></h3>

Although the noncompliant promotional materials cited in 1995 reflected a
wide-range of regulatory and policy offenses, some patterns of violations
emerged, Baylor-Henry said (see "Recent Promotion Violations Generating NOVs,"
p. 4). Remedies for non-compliant promotional materials ranged from requiring
companies to disclose the source of supporting data where appropriate to
mandating corrective advertisements, Baylor-Henry told conference attendees.<P>

DDMAC's philosophy of "working with the industry" does not mean that there are
fewer advertising and promotion violations by drug companies, Baylor-Henry
noted, reiterating that Warning Letters will be issued when necessary.
Nevertheless, DDMAC "will not send out a Warning Letter when an NOV will
suffice," she said.<P>

Speculating on where DDMAC draws the line between advertising violations that
require a Warning Letter and those that warrant an NOV, a food and drug law
attorney told the <i>Monthly Bulletin</i> that the agency's shift away from Warning
Letters likely has little to do with a change in the degree of industry
compliance with its regulations. Rather, the FDA is attempting to keep a low
profile in light of litigation pending against it and congressional reform
efforts, he said.<P>

<hr>
<center><h4>Recent Promotion Violations Generating NOVs<P></h4></center>

<font size=-1>According to Minnie Baylor-Henry, acting director of the FDA's Division of Drug
Marketing, Advertising and Communications, the following missteps in promotional
materials for prescription drugs warranted Notices of Violation (NOVs) sent from
her office to drug sponsors:<P>

<UL><li>Making comparative safety or efficacy claims, or quality-of-life claims based
on nonclinical data (see &#182;421);

<li>Making representations about the product in a reminder piece (see
&#182;416);

<li>Omitting a pregnancy warning;

<li>Failing to cite source information for nonclinical claims;

<li>"Burying" supporting data for claims in a footnote;

<li>Using an incorrect "Orange Book" rating;

<li>Including only selective information from a study;

<li>Distributing home-made pieces;

<li>Listing a dosing recommendation inconsistent with labeling;

<li>Making safety and efficacy claims prior to approval (see &#182;401);

<li>Making inaccurate comparative claims;

<li>Failing to submit the required data on a Form 2253;

<li>Failing to meet the requirements for an accelerated approval product (see
&#182;425);

<li>Claiming superiority over an approved generic;

<li>Failing to have a fair balance of risk and benefit information (see &#182;413);
and

<li>Failing to cite clinical studies to support claims.<P></font></UL>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT>FDA Cites Leading Deviations in  Withholding NDA Approvals</H2>

<P>
Deviations related to incapable manufacturing plants, inadequate good manufacturing practices (GMPs) and poor laboratory-related controls continue to prompt "withhold" recommendations during FDA preap-proval inspections, according to data presented by FDA Compliance Officer Rick Friedman at a recent Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society conference in Washington, D.C.  
</P>

<P>
Together, the three leading deficiencies accounted for 54 percent of all the deviations supporting recommendations to withhold approval of new drug applications (NDAs) and abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) from March 1995 through March 1996, Friedman said at the July 23 conference.
</P>

<P>
During this period, the agency conducted 395 inspections in connection with 681 pending applications. Of these applications, 118 received withhold recommendations -- which typically mean that an NDA or ANDA is removed from the review list until the firm corrects the deviations and, in most cases, the FDA conducts a second inspection to verify the corrections (see ¦752).
</P>

<P>
Although the proportion of withhold recommendations issued was lower during this 12-month period than in previous years, the FDA data show that many firms continue to struggle with the basic manufacturing requirements associated with product approvals. It is also noteworthy that the types of deviations most frequently cited vary substantially between NDAs and ANDAs -- suggesting that some companies may not approach quality control issues with the same level of scrutiny for both types of submissions.
</P>

<P>
<H3>Leading Deviations</H3>
</P>

<P>
For both NDAs and ANDAs, the FDA found that the single most common deviation was plants deemed incapable of producing the drug (see chart, below).  This deviation comprised 31 percent and 22 percent of the deviations alleged in withhold recommendations for NDAs and ANDAs, respectively.
</P>

</P></FONT>

In a follow-up interview with the <I>Monthly Bulletin</I>, Friedman elaborated on the circumstances that most often lead to a "plant not capable" withhold designation.
</P>

<P>
"It's usually very clear-cut," Friedman said. "In some cases, they simply haven't received the manufacturing equipment yet." 
</P>

<P>
Friedman said that when equipment is present and properly installed in plants, inspectors then will examine qualification studies conducted on the equipment, in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOPs). "They need to demonstrate that the equipment is going to operate according to specifications," he said.
</P>

<P>
A closely related deviation, inadequate process development, comprised approximately 8 percent of NDA and ANDA deficiencies, which the FDA says is particularly common in six-month priority application inspections.
</P>

<P>
"This refers to batch records that are not specific or complete, particularly with respect to operating ranges," Friedman said. Other examples of common process development deviations mentioned by Friedman include lack of operating ranges and processes that are not supported by development data.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>"Numerous GMPs," Laboratory Controls</H3>
</P>

<P>
Similarly, Friedman said that withhold recommendations citing "numerous GMP" deviations typically reflect obvious and pervasive GMP-related deficiencies.  Although this broad category of deviations comprised only 11 percent of all deviations alleged for NDAs, it occurred in 20 percent of those for ANDAs, possibly suggesting less rigorous quality control among firms submitting ANDAs.
</P>

<P>
"This means there are fundamental problems that may or may not be product-specific," Friedman said.
</P>

<P>
Although laboratory controls is itself a GMP requirement, it was independently cited in 14 percent of NDA and 12 percent of ANDA withhold recommendations. 
</P>

<P>
"We often find that [companies] have not calibrated their equipment, or when an out-of-specification result is obtained their retest SOP is too arbitrary or is not being followed," Friedman said, as examples of common laboratory-related violations. Friedman added that FDA inspectors also look to see that the retesting schedule is created by the appropriate company personnel and in accordance with SOPs.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Validation Failures</H3>
</P>

<P>
Validation problems comprised only 9 percent of the NDA and ANDA deviations cited. However, when such studies are required, validation data must be carefully reviewed and understood.
</P>

<P>
"Validation is generally not required before receiving approval unless it's a sterile application, which means that you would need certain qualification studies," Friedman said, adding that inadequate sterility is a "big issue" in some plants with aseptic processes.  
</P>

<P>
However, regardless of whether or not a firm is required to conduct validation studies prior to approval, all firms that do so should pay attention to their validation findings.
</P>

<P>
"It's a problem if a firm has conducted validation studies, but they show a lack of reproducability," Friedman said.  Friedman added that industry continues to have problems with scale-up batches for commercial production, a problem that sometimes prompts companies to conduct a full-scale test batch during or prior to validation test batches.
</P>

<P>
"I see a lot of companies doing a full scale batch before they do the three validation batches" he said, explaining that many 
</P>

<P>
companies are able to obtain FDA permission to subsequently market their full scale test batches, if the FDA does not find problems in the subsequent validation batches and identical processes were used.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>ANDA Fraud </H3>
</P>

<P>
Another noteworthy figure among the ANDA deviations is evidence of fraud in 7 percent of deviations alleged, which compares to only a 1 percent frequency among deviations for NDAs.
</P>

<P>
Although Friedman declined to comment on the nature of any fraud the FDA believes it has found, he indicated that typically such violations involve findings of discrepant data.
</P>

<P>
"We are always concerned when there are discrepancies between the drug application and the raw data found at the firm," he said. "Discrepancies always increase our scrutiny of other raw data that is reviewed at the firm."
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Outlook</H3>
</P>

<P>
Although an overall drop in the proportion of withhold recommendations is an encouraging sign for industry, withheld approvals continue to result from nearly one in five preapproval inspections. As in the past, FDA officials continue to cite poor record-keeping as an underlying cause of many of the specific GMP violations that are alleged (see "Poor Record-keeping at Heart of Drug GMP Violations ...," July 1996, p. 3).
</P>

<P>
The recently proposed drug GMP rule also affect the preapproval inspection process, if the rule is finalized in its present form (see "FDA Proposes Tighter Drug GMP Controls," July 1996, p. 1). This new regulation, along with separate, recently issued guidance documents on scale-up and post-approval changes, will create more specific requirements for manufacturing process and equipment controls -- meaning that firms will have less flexibility in establishing and following GMP procedures.

<h2>Localities, homeowners' associations lose ability to restrict antenna
use<P></h2>

Rules aimed at giving alternative programming providers an equal shot at the
video marketplace, while at the same time curbing local restraints on the use of
antennas, were released last month by the Federal Communications Commission.<P>

Issued under a mandate in the 1996 Telecommunications Act, the FCC rules
invalidate measures that "impair" a viewer's ability to receive signals from
multichannel video programming providers that use antennas, including direct
broadcast satellite (if the satellite dish is less than 1 meter in diameter;
larger in Alaska), multichannel multipoint distribution service (except where the
"mast" of the antenna is higher than 12 feet), local multipoint distribution
service and broadcast television. The rules cover installation, maintenance or
use of antennas to receive video programming.<P>

Many local governments, homeowners' associations, condominium boards and other
bodies have enacted laws, zoning ordinances, covenants, etc., that prohibit or
greatly restrict the use of antennas. Some forbid them outright, while others
place conditions (such as requiring fees or permits, elaborate landscaping or
narrow location specifications) that effectively render the satellite unusable.
Congress, in passing the 1996 act, viewed such measures as debilitating to
competition, because they put DBS, MMDS and other satellite providers at a
disadvantage to providers (such as cable operators) that don't rely on satellites
for subscribers to receive programming.<P>

The rules apply to property an antenna user owns (either directly or indirectly)
and has exclusive use of or control over. In a future rulemak-ing the commission
will decide if the prohibition should apply to the installation of antennas on
property owned by a landlord or on common property controlled by a condominium or
homeowners' association.<P>

According to the commission, a restriction "impairs" if it:<P>
<UL>
<LI>unreasonably delays or prevents use of;<P>
<LI>unreasonably increases the cost of; or<P>
<LI>precludes a subscriber from receiving an acceptable quality signal from one
of the antennas. Safety restrictions or restrictions designed to preserve
historic districts may still be enacted and enforced. </UL><P>

Once effective (a date has not been set), the rules will apply to all existing
local laws, covenants, zoning ordinances and similar rules that restrict antenna
use. No "grandfathering" provision was included.<P>

<h3><i>Modified stance</i></h3><P>

The final rules represent a modification of the initial position the FCC took on
local zoning restrictions, when it planned to widely pre-empt local authority
over antenna use. Instead, in the final version, the commission acknowledged that
local governments and other bodies should be able to enforce restrictions that
affect safety and historic preservation concerns.<P>

<h3><i>Do's and don'ts</i></h3><P>

The FCC maintained that the rules balance local concerns with its mandate to
eliminate restrictions that are perceived as unnecessary barriers to competition.
In short, restrictions that are roundly applied (i.e., don't unfairly single-out
antennas), affect but do not impair antenna use, or satisfy justifiable safety or
historic preservation issues are acceptable. To illustrate, the commission gave
examples of what would and would not be allowed under the new regulations. For
example, a city can:<P>
<UL>
<LI>require that antennas be painted to blend in with its background (but not
interfere with reception);<P>
<LI>require that antennas be placed so that they're not visible from the street
(as long as reception is not impaired); or<P>
<LI>assess fees to screen antennas (as long as costs are imposed to screen air
conditioners, trash cans or other similar devices in the neighborhood).</UL><P>

On the other hand, the city would violate the FCC rules if it were to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>create extra "hurdles" for consumers to overcome before using an antenna
(e.g., requiring permits or prior community approval before an antenna is
installed or charging a special fee for using an antenna) if those requirements
apply to one programming signal provider but not another;<P>
<LI>require that relatively unobtrusive DBS antennas be screened by expensive
landscaping (one example cited was a requirement that MMDS antennas be made to
look like a tree with leaves); or<P>
<LI>mandate that antennas be placed in positions that would significantly degrade
or prevent signal reception.</UL><P>

<h3><i>Safety, historic preservation</i></h3><P>

As noted, the rules make exceptions for local restrictions that relate to safety
or historic preservation concerns. For example, the commission said local rules
that prohibit antennas from being installed on fire escapes, dictate how far from
power lines antennas can be located or require proper grounding of antennas are
acceptable, even if they impair signal reception. However, a local body must
state in the text of the rule, its preamble or legislative history that the
restriction is safety-related. (A separate document explaining the safety reasons
would suffice, so that local bodies need not amend existing codes to satisfy the
FCC rule.)<P>

Safety restrictions can be no more burdensome on antenna users than necessary to
achieve the safety goal.<P>

Also, historic preservation concerns may be taken into account when setting
antenna-use restrictions. Areas listed or eligible to be listed in the National
Register of Historic Places are exempt from the FCC rules and may restrict
antenna use. However, such restrictions must be applied uniformly (that is, an
historic area could not restrict antennas while at the same time allow other
modern devices that could arguably have the same detrimental effect on the
historic nature of the area).<P>

<h3><i>Waivers</i></h3><P>

Under the rules, disputes between a governing body and a resident over the
restricted use of an antenna can be resolved by the FCC or a court deciding
whether the restriction is valid (e.g., is safety-related or affects historic
preservation). Additionally, the local body can petition the FCC to waive the
regulation if it has "highly specialized or unusual" concerns about antenna
installation, maintenance or use. The local government or association that is
seeking to restrict antenna use -- and not the consumer -- has the burden of
proving that the restriction is valid. <P>

<title>Investigational IVD CPG Surfaces, Encourages Certification to End Commercialization</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/food/xray/xrayhead.gif" alt="Guide to Medical Device Regulation"></center>
<P>
<h2>Investigational IVD CPG Surfaces, Encourages Certification to End Commercialization</h2>

<P>
After years of discussion about how to regulate research use only (RUO) and investigational use only (IUO) <I>in vitro</I> diagnostic (IVD) devices that are being promoted and distributed commercially for purposes other than research and investigation, the FDA has released a new draft compliance policy guide (CPG). It "encourages" -- but does not require -- manufacturers to establish certification programs to ensure the proper use of these products throughout the distribution chain (see "What Is a Commercialized IVD?," below). 
</P>

<P>
A previous draft version of the CPG released in 1993 had required certification programs to "establish an audit trail of the use of the product from manufacturer or importer to the end user." This provision was hotly contested by IVD manufacturers, who argued they had no control over research carried out by pathologists or other researchers using the manufacturer's IVDs. Such protests may have led the agency to suggest that a certification program is just "one way to demonstrate compliance" with the regulations. 
</P>

<P>
However, although the agency does not require certification programs, it clearly is the FDA's expectation that IVD manufacturers should collect and maintain "documentary evidence" that will "establish limited distribution and use," according to language used in the new CPG (CPG 7124.32). 
</P>

<P>
The agency is instituting this policy because the commercialization of investigational IVDs "has resulted in the widespread use of laboratory tests with unproven performance characteristics," the CPG states. "Use of such tests may mislead providers of medical diagnosis and treatment and cause serious adverse health consequences to unknowing patients." 
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>30-month Window</H3>
</P>

<P>
The FDA recognizes that immediate regulatory action against many commercialized IVDs could result in adverse public health consequences because such tests have become the standard of care and have been in clinical use for many years. Accordingly, the agency is providing manufacturers of certain commercialized devices with 30 months to collect data, submit a premarket approval (PMA) application, a premarket notification (510(k)) submission or a product license application (PLA), and get approval or clearance for their products. 
</P>

<P>
The FDA believes that the 30-month time frame "is a reasonable period for gathering safety and effectiveness data and obtaining agency review for clearance or approval." During this time period, unapproved IVDs must be labeled as research or investigational use devices and must not carry any labeling claims indicating that safety and effectiveness or any performance characteristics have been established for any indicated use. Manufacturers have a grace period of three months from the issue date of the CPG to comply with these labeling requirements. 
</P>

<P>
It also should be noted that IVDs entering the market after the issue date of the CPG will not be granted the 30-month period to come into compliance with the regulations. These devices are expected to have agency clearance or approval prior to being commercialized. 
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>High-risk IVDs Targeted</H3>
</P>

<P>
The agency also states in the CPG that it will take immediate regulatory action during the 30-month grace period to remove violative, high-risk products from the marketplace. The CPG defines such "enforcement priority category I" devices as IVDs that:
</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Meet all of the following criteria:
<UL>
	<LI>	The IVD is being used as a stand-alone test for diagnostic, monitoring or screening procedures;
	
	<LI>	The test result may lead to a significant medical decision or intervention (e.g., organ removal, surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, drug treatment with potentially severe toxicity or quarantine); and
	
	<LI>	The FDA determines there is inadequate scientific proof of the IVD's safety and effectiveness; or
</UL>
	
<P>
	<LI>Are used for diagnosis or prognosis in humans for which there are no data on human use or only anecdotal data to support safety and effectiveness; or 
</P>	

<P>
	<LI>Whose manufacturer fails to comply with labeling requirements, fails to begin a clinical or scientifically valid study to collect data on the device's safety and efficacy, or fails to obtain a PMA or PLA approval or 510(k) clearance within 30 months of the CPG's issue date.
</P>

</OL>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Certification Programs</H3>
</P>

<P>
As noted above, the FDA is encouraging IVD manufacturers to establish certification programs to "assure that the distribution and use of their IVDs will be controlled and limited to use in scientifically sound research or investigations." Although a certification program is not required, companies should be aware that the FDA will be less likely to take an enforcement action, including seizure, injunction, criminal prosecution and imposition of civil  penalties, if the manufacturer has a formal program or system that yields documentation demonstrating the firm's control of its investigational or research devices. The CPG suggests that all parties in the distribution chain should certify that the product will be used only for the purposes of gathering data to support submissions to the FDA and will not be used for diagnostic purposes without confirmation by another medically established diagnostic device or procedure. 
</P>

<P>
For IUO devices, the FDA states that an effective certification program might include:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
	<LI>Written and signed manufacturer, importer or distributor certifications that the product is being distributed properly, and written and signed certifications from individuals, laboratories or health care institutions that they will comply with the investigational use of the device;
</P>
	
<P>
	<LI>Procedures for ensuring that all written, printed or graphic matter used to describe the device complies with labeling requirements; and
</P>	

<P>
	<LI>Procedures for maintaining records of written certifications to establish an audit trail. 
</P>
</UL>

<P>
RUO device certification programs might include, at a minimum:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
	<LI>Certification that the IVD is used for laboratory research and not used for a diagnostic or therapeutic purpose; and
</P>

<P>
	<LI>Certification that the research is not intended for determining the safety and effectiveness of the IVD. 
</P>
</UL>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>CPG Status</H3>
</P>

<P>
Because the CPG still is in draft form, according to agency sources, it is not yet being implemented in the field. The FDA will publish a notice of availability of the final CPG in "the near future," an agency source told the <I>Bulletin</I>. It is likely the CPG will not be finalized until the FDA's recently proposed rules seeking to classify or reclassify immunohistochemical reagents and kits and analyte-specific reagents become final (see "'Home Brew' Test Reagents to Be Restricted," May 1996, p. 10).
</P>

<HR>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>What Is a Commercialized IVD?</H4> 

<FONT SIZE="2"><P>
The FDA's regulations detail specific requirements for <I>in vitro</I> diagnostic (IVD) devices, but allow an exemption from investigational device exemption requirements under 21 CFR &#167;812.2(c)(3), provided the following conditions are met (see &#182;383; App. II):
</P>

<UL>
<P>
	<LI>The devices are in the laboratory stage of development, and labeling does not represent the device as effective and prominently states "For research use only. Not for diagnostic procedures."; or 
</P>
<P>
	<LI>The devices are being shipped and delivered for testing to compare their usefulness to that of recognized products prior to full commercial marketing, and their labeling states: "For investigational use only. The performance characteristics of this product have not been established" (21 CFR &#167;809.10 (c) (2); see App. II).
</P>
</UL>

<P>
According to the new draft FDA compliance policy guide (CPG) (section 300.800), a "research use only" IVD is considered to be commercialized if the device is being used for investigational purposes (such as a clinical study with as few as one patient) where the test results will be reported to the patient's physician or medical records or will be used to assess the patient's condition (even if confirmatory tests or procedures are used).
</P>

<P>
An "investigational use only" IVD is considered to be commercialized, the CPG states, if it is:
</P>

<UL>
<P>
	<LI>Labeled or promoted with statements indicating the devices are safe or effective prior to agency approval or clearance; or
</P>

<P>
	<LI>Distributed to any party not involved with the conduct of a clinical trial to determine safety and effectiveness.

<title> Congressional Scrutiny, Proactive Credo Drive FDA Enforcement Efforts</title>

<h2> Congressional Scrutiny, Proactive Credo Drive FDA Enforcement Efforts </h2>
<p>

Companies seeking insight into the FDA's compliance concerns with respect to

promotion have been hampered by the lack of publicly available enforcement

documents. Experts disagree on why the agency has shifted away from issuing

Warning Letters as a policy-making tool.<p>

Speaking at the Drug Information Association's annual meeting June 12 in San

Diego, one food and drug law consultant noted that FDA's Center for Drug

Evaluation and Research (CDER) has issued few Warning Letters for advertising

and promotion violations in recent years (see &#182;935).<p> 

In fact, CDER's Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and Communications

(DDMAC) issued no Warning Letters for such violations in calendar year 1995,

reflecting a steady downward trend in the number issued since 1992 (see &#182;930;

"Warning Letters Take Back Seat to NOVs...," May 1996, p. 1).<p>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>FDA Philosophy</H3>

The consultant attributed the dearth of enforcement documents to two factors.

First, although the FDA disclaimed that it requires preclearance of

direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising in a recent <i>Federal Register</i> notice, most

companies still submit their DTC promotional materials to the agency for review

prior to dissemination (see &#182;430; "FDA Disclaims Preclearance of DTC Ads," July

1996, p. 1). This voluntary preclearance process weeds out violative DTC ads,

thereby reducing the need for later enforcement action in the form of Warning

Letters, the consultant said.<p> 

Second, DDMAC appears to have adopted the new, overall philosophy that it is

better to play a proactive role in enforcing its advertising policies than to

play a reactive one, he said.<p>

While there is nothing inherently wrong with this philosophy, one major drawback

of its practical implementation is that "the thought processes that lead up to

the policy are not public and therefore nobody else can understand or benefit

from" the agency's mechanisms for these decisions, the consultant commented.<p>

This leads to "a reinvention of wheels on a continuous basis," he said, adding

that as a result, there is no way to compare what "you are doing as a company to

what other companies have gone through" with their ad campaigns.<p> 

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Laying Low</H3>

 The FDA may be maintaining a low enforcement profile due to the highly charged

reform atmosphere on Capitol Hill, contended David Adams, a partner in the

Washington, D.C.-based firm Olsson, Frank and Weeda. The agency's policies on

advertising and promotion, particularly the dissemination of information on

off-label uses, is a significant part of what is fueling congressional reform

efforts, Adams noted. Thus, it is "quite probable that the agency has not wanted

to appear to be overly aggressive on enforcement during the pendency of reform

legislation," he added.<p>

Alan Slobodin, counsel to the House Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on

Oversight and Investigations, agreed. Although both the Senate and House FDA

reform proposals are "quite modest, they have engendered a great deal of

controversy," he told DIA attendees.<p>

According to Slobodin, FDA has been reacting to what is going on the Hill and in

the courts, and the House Oversight and Investigations subcommittee is taking

note. For example, he said, FDA "is now articulating its statutory mission in a

more detailed, nuanced way than it has been before."<p>  

The agency's "former mantra was 'protect the public health' which led to a very

aggressive stance on dissemination of off-label information," he noted. Now, the

FDA has adopted more of a "dual mission": protecting the public health balanced

with getting products to market, he explained.<p>

Slobodin also observed that the FDA has said it has a mission to advance

scientific research, and that Commissioner of Food and Drugs David Kessler has

stated that the agency must be committed to "fairness, objectivity and

even-handedness." However, as commendable as these multiple missions and goals

may sound individually, as applied to policies on promotion, they may conflict

with each other, Slobodin cautioned.<p>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Monitoring NOVs</H3>

Congressional scrutiny likely has driven FDA "underground" on enforcement, as

evidenced by the decreased use of Warning Letters and the increased use of

Notices of Violation (NOVs) (see &#182;911). Slobodin revealed that Rep. Joe Barton

(R-Texas), chairman of the subcommittee, requested 163 NOVs issued by DDMAC in

fiscal year 1995 for committee review. The purpose of the review is to determine

whether the 163 NOVs were in keeping with the handful of violation "patterns" 

identified by DDMAC Director Minnie Baylor-Henry last year, Slobodin said (see

"Recent Promotion Violations Generating NOVs," May 1996, p. 3).<p>

"We are keeping our options open as far as what we will do when we've looked at

them, Slobodin said. Congress may want to provide a summary of all of them and

then make them available to the public."<p> 

The consultant supported that proposal, noting that "the easiest solution [to

the lack of compliance guidance through Warning Letters] is to make NOVs

available so that [industry] can see what the violations are... and try to figure

out what the broad policy implications are" based on DDMAC's actions against

individual companies.<p>

<hr>

<h4><center>CBER Follows CDER Lead, Disclaims Preclearance<p></center></h4>

<font size=-1>The FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research's (CBER's) Advertising

and Promotional Labeling Staff (APLS) no longer will require companies to

preclear their advertising and promotion materials, APLS Senior Regulatory

Review Officer Toni Stifano said at the Drug Information Association's annual

meeting June 12 in San Diego.<p> 

The announcement comes on the heels of the agency's recent <i>Federal Register</i>

notice clarifying the absence of a preclearance requirement for

direct-to-consumer (DTC) promotional materials (61 FR 24314) (see "FDA Disclaims

Preclearance of DTC Ads" July 1996, p. 1). CBER's absolute requirement of

preclearance for all promotional materials long has been one of the key elements

distinguishing its policies from those of the Center for Drug Evaluation and

Research (CDER) (see &#182;511).<p> 

While CDER merely requested voluntary submission of DTC and launch materials --

and precleared nothing else except by special request of the company -- CBER's

APLS historically has mandated submission of all "promotional labeling" for all

biologics for which licenses are pending, for licensed products for which there

is a significant amendment, or for newly approved products.<p>

The difference between CDER's and CBER's approaches to preclearance stems from

the separate laws governing the regulated products. Drugs are regulated under

the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act), which precludes preclearance

of advertising except in "extraordinary circumstances" (FD&amp;C Act &#167;502(n); see

&#182;412; App. I). Biologics are regulated under the FD&amp;C Act and the Public Health

Service Act, which contains no such prohibition.<p>

Stifano noted that as part of the Clinton administration's "reinventing

government" initiative, CBER recently issued a proposal to drop the policy

requiring preclearance for ads accompanying a supplemental license application

for an approved biologic (61 FR 2739) (see "CBER to Harmonize Ad Rules with

CDER," May 1996, p. 4). However, implementation of CBER's commitment to end

preclearance is stalled by concerns that the Center is violating existing

regulations that remain in place until the proposal is finalized.<p> 

To clarify the situation, CBER plans to issue a <I>Federal Register</I> notice "in the

very near future that explains that we are in fact going to implement this full

tilt prior to the final rule being published," Stifano said. In the meantime,

the Center is "changing some of the verbiage that is going out with the

approvable or approval letters to state that 'you may wish to submit your

introductory campaigns for our preclearance, for our review,'" she added.<p> 

Stifano made clear that she supports voluntary submission of launch materials.

Voluntary preclearance allows CBER to be proactive, she explained. Such

submissions give industry "an opportunity to get a reading from us early on what

we find to be acceptable versus not acceptable and it will help industry in the

long run, preventing Warning Letters or [notices of violation]."<p>

"Voluntary submission is a value-added service," Stifano said, declining to make

a recommendation to companies undecided about whether to send in their

promotional materials following the policy change. Stifano said that CBER will

continue to work very closely with CDER to harmonize policies in this area.</font><p>

<title>Device Group Calls for Pilot Committee To Advise DDMAC on Guidance Practices</title>
</head>

<P>

<h2> Device Group Calls for Pilot Committee To Advise DDMAC on Guidance Practices</h2>


The Indiana Medical Device Manufacturers Council Inc. (IMDMC) is urging the FDA

to adopt negotiated guidance development procedures "to encourage greater public

participation in the development of the first draft of guidance documents." <p>

The IMDMC recommends the FDA establish a diverse committee to advise the Center

for Drug Evaluation and Research's Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and

Communication (DDMAC) on how to develop guidance for industry on promotion

issues.<p>

However, the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) issued an

internal memorandum establishing interim "good guidance practices" (GGPs) for

use while the agency considers the issue. Those interim GGPs may not require

involvement of the public at any level for certain types of guidances, the CDRH

memo states.<p>

<h3>Public Participation<p></h3>

The IMDMC's proposal comes in response to the agency's March 7 <i>Federal Register</i>

notice requesting input on its treatment and use of guidance documents and on

how to both improve and involve the public in the guidance process (61 FR 9181)

(see "FDA and Industry Must Partner to Develop Better Guidances, Expert Says,"

July 1996, p. 1). <p>

The issue of GGPs was raised by the IMDMC in a May 1995 citizen petition filed

with the FDA, and was followed by a public meeting on the subject in April. The

IMDMC also is part of the recently formed <I>ad hoc</I> Guidance Document Task Force --

composed of 13 medical products trade groups -- which submitted separate comments

to the agency.  <p>

In its comments, the IMDMC calls on the agency to more fully involve the public

in the guidance development process by creating interdisciplinary committees

that include all of the constituencies affected by the proposed policy. The

IMDMC suggests that the agency initiate a pilot program of negotiated guidance

development through an advisory committee to assist DDMAC. <p>

DDMAC is an appropriate choice for a pilot program for the following three

reasons, according to the device group's comments:<p>

(1) It is one of the major divisions within the FDA that operates without input

from any advisory committee;<p>

(2) There is a "desperate need for guidance [from DDMAC] on a wide variety of

marketing practices"; and<p>

(3) Marketing issues are well-suited for interdisciplinary review because they

involve legal, scientific and business concerns.<p>

<h3>Simpler Process<p></h3>

In its comments, the IMDMC urges the agency to focus on defining clearly the

types of communications that will be subject to GGPs, rather than on the

"nomenclature" of the documents themselves. The FDA should "focus on the

substance of a communication, rather than its form," the group states,

suggesting that the agency define guidance documents as any "communications that

in effect announce a regulatory expectation to a broad audience." <p>

The IMDMC proposes that once the initial draft of the guidance document is

complete, it should be subjected to "broad public comment" through a two-tier

process that is simpler and more efficient than the three-tier process described

in the FDA's <i>Federal Register</i> notice. <p>

The two-tier system would be based on the varying need for expediency in issuing

the guidance, the group's comments note, with the first tier including those

documents for which the FDA has the opportunity to solicit comments in advance

of publication.<p>

The second tier would include those guidances "which because of the public

interest cannot wait for advance public comment" before issuance. The IMDMC's

plan would eliminate a third tier envisioned by the FDA as consisting of

documents that include a single notice stating that public comments are welcome.

<p>

The group recommends the agency use the <i>Federal Register</i> as the vehicle to

communicate the progress of the guidance development process and that the agency

also publish the final document there. Once the final document is in use, the

IMDMC calls on the FDA to adopt auditing and monitoring procedures to confirm

that staffers are following GGPs, particularly to ensure that FDA employees are

not using guidance documents as binding rules.<p>

<h3>Task Force Comments<p></h3>

The Guidance Document Task Force comments elaborate on the IMDMC's admonishment

that the FDA avoid using guidance documents as binding policy by specifically

cautioning the agency to cease using "unofficial vehicles such as [W]arning

[L]etters, speeches and press releases" to communicate guidance so as not to

undermine GGPs. <p>

The task force states it is especially concerned that "when FDA adopts GGPs that

impose responsibilities on the agency, the agency staff will have added

incentive" to fall back on the easier, unofficial communications. The agency

should train staffers in GGPs to reduce this risk, the task force says.<p>

Like the IMDMC, the task force suggests much greater public input in the

guidance development process, predicting that this "would go a long way toward

improving the content of guidance[s]" it complains are unclear and outdated.

Public input also would help the agency better prioritize those areas for which

guidance is necessary, the task force adds.<p>

<h3>CDRH's Lead<p></h3>

CDRH issued an internal memorandum June 6 entitled "Standard Operating

Procedures for the Development and Use of CDRH Guidance Documents" which was

circulated to the Office of Device Evaluation Review staff. The memo establishes

interim GGPs for use "while the [a]gency formulates its strategy for dealing

with this important issue." <p>

 However, unlike the IMDMC and task force proposals -- which would mandate public

input at some stage for all documents that "meet the threshold determination for

what constitutes guidance" -- the CDRH procedures require the document authors to

meet with management "to discuss whether comment from outside parties should be

solicited." The CDRH memo explains that public comment is not needed for those

guidance documents that "simply capture current practices." To assist staff in

making this threshold determination the memo includes a decision tree. <p>

The memo also requires CDRH staff to distinguish those draft guidances

distributed for comment and those "released for actual use," suggesting that it

plans to continue implementing informal guidance policies. Moreover, the CDRH

memo recommends staffers use several channels of distribution for documents for

which public comment will be sought, including, but not limited to, publication

in the <i>Federal Register.</i><p>

The memo does note that guidance documents in any form "do not confer legally

enforceable rights or responsibilities on either the FDA or the public" and

should not be treated as such. In addition, the memo reminds CDRH staff that all

guidance documents are subject to public comment even after they become

effective and that the developmental process is "a continuous one." The Center

states that it will conduct training in the FDA's GGPs as they are

implemented.<p>

<title>FDA to Clarify Dietary Supplement Structure/Function Notification Process</title>

<P>
<h2>FDA to Clarify Dietary Supplement Structure/Function Notification Process</h2>

<P>
Dietary supplement labels bearing "structure/function" claims would need to include a disclaimer that the FDA has not evaluated this statement, according to a proposed rule published Sept. 27 in the <I>Federal Register</I> (61 FR 50771, see App. III). A structure/function claim is a truthful, nonmisleading statement that describes the benefits of a nutrient or dietary ingredient on a "classical" nutrient deficiency disease or describes general well being from consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient.
</P>

<P>
The disclaimer would read as follows: "This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease." 
</P>

<P>
The FDA has proposed the regulation to streamline the procedure that requires dietary supplement companies to notify the FDA within 30 days of marketing a product that bears a structure/function claim on the label.
</P>

<P>
After the notification requirement became effective as Sec. 403(r)(6) of the Dietary Supplement Health and Safety Act (DSHEA), the FDA received timely notification from some manufacturers. However, it also has received inquiries from other companies that "reflect uncertainty about what must be done to notify the agency about a statement of this type for a dietary supplement product." 
</P>

<P>
In addition, the agency has received numerous notifications for statements that are unacceptable because they indicate that the product does intend to cure, treat, mitigate, diagnose or prevent disease. These types of claims are not authorized by DSHEA. Accordingly, the FDA advises companies that if they continue to market the product with these claims, they risk regulatory action by the agency.
</P>

<P>
The proposed rule states that dietary supplement manufacturers, packers or distributors must notify FDA's Office of Special Nutritionals within 30 days after first marketing a dietary supplement that bears a structure/function claim as described in DSHEA. It also would require companies to include in the notification the name of the dietary supplement (including the brand name), the name of the dietary ingredient about which the claim is being made, and the text of the structure/function statement.
</P>

<P>
This information will allow the agency to clearly identify which product the company is referring to, and whether the statement is of the type that can appropriately be made.
</P>

<title>Allergen Labeling Concerns FDA, Consumers</title>

<h2>Allergen Labeling Concerns FDA, Consumers</h2>

<P>
Consumers share the FDA's concerns that some allergens are not being declared on the food label due to misinterpretation of the exemptions for ingredient labeling, according to comments received recently by the agency on proposed revisions to flavor labeling regulations.
</P>

<P>
In a notice to manufacturers dated June 10, 1996, the agency noted that there are two "very narrow exemptions" from ingredient labeling requirements. One, 21 CFR &#167;403(ii), provides that spices, flavorings and colorings may be declared collectively without naming each one; the other, 21 CFR &#167;101.100(a)(3), exempts incidental additives such as processing aids that are present in only insignificant levels and do not have any technical or functional effect in the finished food from ingredient declaration. 
</P>

<P>
Because very small amounts of allergen present in a food can cause an adverse reaction in sensitive people, no level of allergen present in food can be considered insignificant, the FDA said. 
</P>

<P>
In the June notice, the agency asked manufacturers "to examine their product formulations for ingredients and processing aids that contain known allergens that they may have considered to be exempt from declarations incidental additives ... and to declare the presence of such ingredients in the ingredient statement." Using the name of the ingredient and a parenthetical statement "processing aid" would be acceptable, the FDA indicated.
</P>

<P>
<H3>What Is an Allergen?</H3>
</P>

<P>
Although the FDA has not formally defined "allergens," it did issue a 1992 policy statement recognizing milk, eggs, fish, crustacea, mollusks, tree nuts, wheat and legumes, particularly peanuts and soybeans, as known allergens (57 FR 22984).
</P>

<P>
"The voluntary declaration of an allergenic ingredient of a color, flavor, or spice could be accomplished by simply naming the allergenic ingredient in the ingredient list. Other, non-allergenic ingredients that are exempt from declaration would remain unlisted," the FDA wrote.
</P>

<P>
In its recent request for comments on the labeling of natural and artificial flavors (see  "Proposed Changes to Specific Labeling Regs ...," p. 1) the FDA received 114 comments from consumers concerned about "hidden" ingredients in their food, specifically monosodium glutamate (MSG) and other substances they fear are masked by phrases such as "flavorings" or "natural flavorings." 
</P>

<P>
Consumers felt the terms "natural flavors" and "artificial flavors" were too broad, and urged the FDA to ensure that every substance present in the food be listed on the label. For example, the National Organization Mobilized to Stop Glutamate (NoMSG) wrote in comments:
</P>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"All sources of MSG (including MSG-containing compounds) must identify this substance when added to foods. Our position is that the word 'flavoring' is vague, frequently deceptive, and has been used as a subterfuge for widespread addition of monosodium glutamate- containing substances in foods." 
</BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P>
Another group of consumers suffering from the autoimmune disease celiac sprue stressed that they must avoid certain ingredients.
</P>

<P>
<H3>Industry Response</H3>
</P>

<P>
Several industry groups also addressed the allergy issue in their comments. The National Seasoning Manufacturers Association, for example, wrote:
</P>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"FDA should publish a list of allergens that must be listed by common or usual name when used in a food additive or a flavoring. This would eliminate hydrolyzed vegetable proteins with the associated glutamates, egg products, dairy products, yeasts, fish, crustaceans, meat by-products (e.g., gelatin, blood protein), etc. from being labeled as "Natural Flavors" with the associated health and religious problems." </BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>
Because consumers were united in their concerns that foods were not adequately labeled, and called on FDA to ensure that some form of labeling requirement for allergens be established, it is likely that the agency will carefully consider allergen labeling provisions.

<html> <title> Court Rules on Whether Workers Were 'Subject To' Pay Docking </title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/person/file/filehead.gif" alt="FLSA Employee Exemption Handbook">
<P>
<h2>Court Rules on Whether Workers Were 'Subject To' Pay Docking</h2>
<body>
<h3><i>New Jersey Engineers' Case Marks the First Time 3rd Circuit Considers the
Controversial Issue</i></h3>

In an overtime compensation suit involving engineers, yet another federal appeals
court has ruled that an employer's improper pay docking policy violated the Fair
Labor Standards Act (FLSA) salary basis test, even though that policy was never
actually enforced.<P>

In <i>Balgowan v. New Jersey Department of Transportation,</i> No. 95-5276 (3rd
Cir. May 16, 1996), engineers sued their employer claiming unpaid overtime
compensation. The state transportation department contended that the engineers
were exempt from the FLSA as professionals, but the employees disagreed. They
argued, among other things, that they were not paid on a salary basis as required
by the act because their pay had been subject to docking for reasons prohibited
by U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) salary basis regulations (29 CFR
&#167;541.118).<P>

DOL's salary basis rules place tight restrictions on when an FLSA-exempt
employee's pay may be docked without the exemption being lost (see &#182;220-228
of the <i>Handbook</i>). In recent years, controversy has arisen over when an
employee is actually "subject to" an employer's pay reduction policy. The
question has been reviewed by several federal appeals courts, and to date, their
interpretations have varied (see diagram below).<P>

For example, some federal appeals courts, including those covering the 8th, 5th
and 11th Circuits, have concluded that an employee may still qualify for a
professional exemption from the FLSA even if the employer has a policy that
<i>theoretically</i> could result in the employee's pay being docked. In other
words, the professional exemption may still apply, these courts reason, if a
violative pay-docking policy is in place but no deduction in wages has actually
occurred.<P>

Conversely, other federal appeals courts, including those covering the 2nd, 9th
and District of Columbia Circuits, have interpreted "subject to" differently.
Specifically, these courts have ruled that any time the <i>potential</i> for a
deduction in an exempt employee's pay exists, the employee is not paid on a
salary basis. The mere existence of a violative pay docking policy, these courts
conclude, is enough to destroy the exemption.<P>

Until <i>Balgowan,</i> the 3rd Circuit had not ruled on this question.<P>

<h3>The Engineers' Complaint</h3>

The court began its analysis by carefully reviewing the transportation
department's pay docking policy. The court found that the policy allowed for an
employee's suspension without pay for infractions such as tardiness,
insubordination and neglect of duty.<P>

DOL regulations (29 CFR &#167;541.118(a)(5)) allow employers to dock an
employee's pay for infractions of safety rules of major significance without
losing the exemption. But the regulations state that these safety rules include
"only those relating to the prevention of serious danger to the plant, or other
employees, such as rules prohibiting smoking in explosive plants, oil refineries
and coal mines."<P>

The appeals court found that the employer's practice of docking pay for
tardiness, incompetence and other non-safety-related reasons violated the salary
test. "These infractions exceed the scope of the safety exception to the
professional exemption," the court said.<P>

<h3>Status of the Pay Docking Policy</h3>

As a follow-up argument, the employer contended that the professional exemption
should nevertheless be retained for the workers because the employer had never
actually enforced the pay docking policy and no engineer had ever suffered a
reduction in pay because of it. In essence, the employer asserted that an actual
docking of pay had to occur before the engineers could lose their status as
exempt professionals.<P>

Considering the stance of the other federal appeals courts with regard to the
issue, the 3rd Circuit embraced the decisions by the D.C., 2nd and 9th Circuits.
The 3rd Circuit concluded that being "subject to" reductions in pay for minor
non-safety-related reasons does not require actual docking of pay to have
occurred.<P>

"We conclude that the language of [29 CFR &#167;541.118(a)(5)] would be strained
by holding that an employee is 'subject to' a reduction only if an actual
reduction has occurred," the court said. "We believe that the [transportation
department's] disciplinary policy, even if not enforced, renders the engineers'
salary contingent rather than fixed."<P>

"We believe this approach more accurately comports with reality," the court
continued. "This approach is also consistent with the policy that the FLSA is a
remedial act and exemptions from its coverage are to be narrowly construed
against employers."<P>

"Finally, it would be rather arbitrary to hold that whether an employer qualifies
for the professional exemption shall be determined by the employees' collective
good behavior," the court pointed out. "If one employee violates the disciplinary
policy and is docked, so the argument goes, all the employees would lose the
professional exemption and be entitled to FLSA-required overtime rates."<P>

The court also reasoned that an unenforced employment policy, like the one the
transportation department claimed to have adopted, causes confusion as to whether
that policy is in effect and should be followed.<P>

<h3>Other Issues</h3>

The appeals court also considered several other points in reaching its decision.
For example, the court ruled that the transportation department did not qualify
for relief under the FLSA's so-called "window of correction" provisions (29 CFR
&#167;541.118(a)(6)) because the employer's pay docking error was not
"inadvertent." In addition, because the transportation department is a public
employer, the court reviewed the applicability of the FLSA's salary basis test
for the engineers' work both before and after Sept. 6, 1991.<P>

In September 1991, DOL amended its salary basis regulations to permit public
employers to dock the pay of exempt employees for partial-day absences. Citing
prior case law on this issue, the court ruled that the salary test did not apply
to the engineers prior to Sept. 6, 1991. Therefore, the engineers need only meet
the "duties" portion of the professional exemption to qualify before that date,
the court said.<P>

The engineers conceded that they met the duties test prior to September 1991;
therefore, they were exempt from the FLSA's overtime provisions. With regard to
the engineers' exempt status after that date, the court held that the salary test
had not been met (due to the docking for other than major safety reasons).
Consequently, the engineers were non-exempt and due overtime for that period.<P>

<html> <title>Columbia University Found Not Liable Under Title VII for Failure to
Investigate Sexual Harassment Claims, Court Rules</title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/person/sink/sinkhead.gif" alt="Educator's Guide to Controlling Sexual Harassment">
<P>
<h2>Columbia University Found Not Liable Under Title VII for Failure to
Investigate Sexual Harassment Claims, Court Rules</h2>

<body>
After affirming a jury's finding that the sexual harassment allegations of a
Columbia University employee against her co-worker were unfounded, the U.S.
District Court for Southern New York June 28 ruled that the school was not liable
under Title VII for failure to investigate the accuser's complaint.<P>

The court said that "even if the law were such to impose liability on an
employer" for a failure to investigate, Columbia University would not have been
liable because a "sufficient evidentiary basis" did not exist for a finding
against the school.<P>

<h3>The Alleged Harassment</h3>

While a student at Columbia, plaintiff Sharon Karibian in 1986 began working on a
fundraising project within the university. She claimed that her supervisor, Mark
Urban, "pressured her into having sexual relations" with him intermittently
between 1987 and 1989.<P>

According to Karibian, Urban had engaged in "unwelcome sexual activities" with
her and had indicated that "she would receive employment advantages if she
submitted" to his advances and disadvantages if she did not. In her claims
against Urban, Karibian alleged that he committed two types of sexual harassment:
quid pro quo and hostile environment.<P>

Urban conceded that he had "pursued Karibian romantically" and that a sexual
relationship had developed between them. However, he asserted that their
relationship was consensual.<P>

Based on the evidence presented, a jury found that Urban did not sexually harass
Karibian. Though not specifically stated in the court's opinion, one of the
deciding factors in the verdict was a series of conflicting statements made by
Karibian concerning her relationship with Urban.<P>

Karibian's characterization of the relationship at trial contradicted records
made of her discussions with two university employees with whom she met to
discuss the relationship and alleged abuse. Karibian testified at trial that
Urban had "forced, violent sexual intercourse" with her on two occasions in early
and mid-1988, and added that undesired "activities of a sexual nature" continued,
with a break of several months, until the spring of 1989.<P>

However, the notes of a clinical psychologist with whom Karibian met on eight
occasions in 1988 indicated that her "problem, as described in detail to [the
psychologist], was Karibian's anxiety about being able to hold Urban as a
boyfriend," the court noted. Karibian said nothing to the psychologist about
unwelcome advances, or the use of force or violence in connection with the
relationship, records showed.<P>

According to a member of the university's panel on sexual harassment with whom
Karibian consulted later in 1988, Karibian told her "repeatedly that she had
willingly engaged" in the relationship, but now wanted to end it and feared that
if she tried, she might suffer consequences at work. Karibian later denied that
she had made statements indicating that the relationship was voluntary.<P>

<h3>Employer Liability for Investigations</h3>

Although the jury did not find that Urban sexually harassed Karibian, it did
conclude, in response to one of Karibian's claims, that the university received
notice of the alleged harassment in September 1988, well before the time the
school acted on the complaint in 1990. The jury also affirmed Karibian's claim
that the university failed "to take reasonable steps to determine the facts about
Karibian's complaint and take appropriate remedial action," the court said.<P>

In light of the jury's finding that the school failed to act on the harassment
complaint, the court was faced with determining whether the school's failure was
a "valid issue under the law." In other words, the court was asked to decide
whether the school could face liability under Title VII or the New York Human
Rights Law for not acting on the complaint, even though the complaint had been
invalidated.<P>

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits (among other things) sex
discrimination in employment (42 U.S.C. &#167;2000e), as does the New York law in
question. The court found that neither statute "has any language expressly
creating liability for failure to investigate and remedy a complaint of
discrimination." The laws do provide certain specific protections, such as a bar
against retaliation for harassment complaints, but as the court stated, "[n]o one
contends that the failure to investigate and remedy a complaint" is equivalent to
retaliation or any other conduct protected by the statute.<P>

Case law establishing an employer's obligation to investigate sexual harassment
claims was cited by Karibian, but the court found that the evidence failed to
support her claim because in the cited cases, the accused employees had been
found guilty of sexual harassment.<P>

The court recognized that "one might believe" that employers have a "moral or
ethical duty" to investigate claims, but added that this is distinct from a
statutory duty. And while the court acknowledged that conducting investigations
that are fair to both accuser and accused is difficult, it said that despite the
lack of statutory obligation, employers have a "strong incentive" to conduct
investigations of harassment complaints to avoid or curb liability in cases where
sexual harassment <i>does</i> exist.<P>

<h3>The University's Investigation</h3>

The court next examined the university's response to Karibian's complaint. In
September 1988, Karibian took advantage of two university options for dealing
with possible harassment:<P>

<UL>
<LI>she discussed the alleged harassment with a member of the university's panel
on sexual harassment (as stated above); and <P>

<LI>she discussed Urban's actions with a worker in the school's Office for Equal
Opportunity and Affirmative Action (EEOA).</UL>

Although the court determined that both procedures are "entirely confidential,"
Karibian claimed that these actions constituted notice to the school of alleged
harassment.<P>

Columbia University students and employees who believe they are being harassed
also have an option to file a complaint under an appropriate school grievance
procedure, the court noted. This option is not confidential; individuals who file
a complaint initiate an investigation of their claims. Karibian did not take
advantage of this option and in fact specifically asked the EEOA employee that
"there be no investigation at that time," the court said. After her meetings with
the above individuals, her sexual relationship with Urban continued.<P>

Despite Karibian's argument to the contrary, the court determined that Karibian
had not made a complaint "under circumstances which would allow Columbia to
engage in investigative and corrective measures until early 1990." At that time,
Karibian informed one of Urban's superiors of his alleged misconduct. (By this
time, their sexual relationship had ended, and the misconduct allegedly took the
form of retaliation, or "detrimental employment actions.")<P>

Urban's superior then reported the complaint to John Borden, deputy vice
president of the division where Karibian and Urban worked. At that point, the
court said, "[i]mmediate steps were taken both to investigate the complaint and
to provide a remedy to Karibian."<P>

First, the university took steps to ensure that Urban and Karibian never had to
meet alone in their business dealings. Then, deciding to take "a more drastic
step," the university removed Urban as Karibian's supervisor in February. In
April, the school requested and received Urban's resignation (but not because of
the sexual harassment allegations).<P>

According to the court, "it is difficult to understand how Columbia could have
done more than it did to investigate Karibian's complaint and to provide remedial
measures." Because of the absence of university liability in the case, the court
granted a motion by Columbia to set aside an award of $450,000 in damages the
university was slated to pay the accuser.<P>

In the original trial, an array of other claims, such as complaints of
retaliation by Urban, Columbia and Borden under state law, had been dismissed.
The court dismissed motions by Karibian attempting to reinstate these and other
claims.<P>

hostile environment sexual harassment, see the March 1994 <i>Monthly
Bulletin,</i> page 1. (<i>Karibian v. Columbia University,</i> S.D.N.Y, No. 91

<title>FLSA Amendments Revise Pay Rule for Certain Computer Professionals</title>

<P>
<h2>FLSA Amendments Revise Pay Rule for Certain Computer Professionals</h2>
<h3><i>Meanwhile, Comp Time Bill Makes Headway in Congress</i></h3>

A newly enacted amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) fixes at $27.63
the amount a computer professional must be paid per hour to qualify for
exemption from the act. The amendment was enacted as part of a law (H.R. 3448,
P.L. 104-188) that raises the federal minimum wage 90 cents per hour by Sept. 1,
1997.<P>

The amendment, which takes effect Oct. 1, 1996, adds to the FLSA a provision
establishing the minimum hourly wage a computer worker must receive to qualify
for exemption from the overtime protections of the act -- provided he or she
meets other duties requirements also set forth in the amendment (see &#182;531
of the <i>Handbook</i>). Currently, FLSA implementing regulations, as set forth
in the <i>Code of Federal Regulations</i> (CFR), provide that exempt computer
professionals be paid on a salary basis, or be paid an hourly rate of at least
6.5 times the minimum wage (29 CFR &#167;541.312). The new law removes the 6.5
multiplication factor from the rules and establishes the flat $27.63 rate.<P>

The new amendment means that FLSA implementing regulations and the statute
provide two different minimum wage standards for exempt computer professionals
who are paid by the hour: $27.63, under the FLSA, and 6.5 times the increased
minimum wage, under the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) existing regulations.
According to a source at the DOL, employers should rely on the new amendment,
which supersedes the DOL's rules. "Basically," the DOL said, "this [amendment]
freezes the law as it is now." Therefore, employers will henceforth be held only
to the $27.63 hourly minimum, regardless of future increases in the minimum
wage.<P>

The source added that DOL's rules will be amended to reflect the change, but
could not predict when such an amendment would come.<P>

H.R. 3448, the bill containing the amendment, was approved by Congress Aug. 2
and signed by President Clinton Aug. 20. The law includes various tax reform
provisions, many geared toward helping small businesses.<P>

Under the law, the minimum wage will increase to $4.75 per hour effective Oct.
1, 1996. A second increase, to $5.15, will occur Sept. 1, 1997. The effective
dates were established by a House-Senate conference committee; earlier versions
of the bill would have set earlier dates for the two steps of the increase.<P>

In general, all employees covered by the FLSA must be paid at least the minimum
wage, which was set at $4.25 per hour in March 1991 (see &#182;101 of the
<i>Handbook</i>).<P>

In addition to the changes for computer professionals, the new law contains a
measure revising the "tip credit system." Rather than paying "tipped" employees
50 percent of the minimum wage plus tips, employers may now pay workers $2.13
per hour plus tips (as under the previous system, the resulting amount must at
least equal the minimum wage). The law also enacts an "opportunity wage"
provision, which permits employers to pay new employees under 20 years old at a
rate of $4.25 per hour for their first 90 days of employment. Both provisions
are effective Oct. 1.<P>

<h3>Comp Time Bill Approved in House</h3>

A second FLSA-related bill (H.R. 2391), which would give private sector
employees the option to receive compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay,
passed the House July 30. The original version of the bill was introduced by
Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C., on Sept. 21, 1995.<P>

Pursuant to the FLSA, employers are required to pay their non-exempt employees
at a rate of time and one-half for all hours worked over 40 in a week.
Ballenger's bill would alter the FLSA to allow private employers to offer their
employees paid time off (or "comp time") in lieu of overtime pay, an option
currently enjoyed in the public sector.<P>

Employee use of comp time under the bill would be voluntary, and employers could
grant comp time only if provided for by a collective bargaining agreement (or
similar agreement made by an employee representative), or an agreement entered
into by the employee before work began.<P>

The bill also provides, among other things, that comp time granted as overtime
compensation would be given at a rate of time and one-half, the same rate at
which cash overtime is awarded. At the end of each calendar year (or other
pre-established 12-month period), an employer would have to give employees cash
in exchange for all unused comp time they had accrued.<P>

The bill also provides that an employee's entrance into a comp time agreement
could not be a "condition of employment." Under the legislation, employers could
not "directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten or coerce" employees into
agreeing to receive comp time rather than cash for overtime or using comp time
once it is accrued. Employers that violated these rules would be liable under
the legislation for monetary penalties.<P>

Under the bill, private sector employees could accrue up to 240 comp time hours.
Employees who exceeded these limits would receive cash overtime payments for the
additional hours.<P>

Ballenger said in introducing the bill that offering employees a choice between
overtime pay and comp time would "help ease the burdens of juggling work and
personal responsibilities." But at a hearing on the bill held last December,
several Democrats on the House Workforce Protections Subcommittee expressed
concern that the legislation did not guarantee a sufficient degree of protection
for employees.<P>

Since its introduction, several provisions attempting to create increased worker
protections have been added to the bill. Nevertheless, opponents of the bill are
still concerned about employee rights, worrying, for instance, that the bill
would allow employers to force workers to accept comp time instead of overtime
pay.<P>

The Senate Aug. 1 placed the comp time bill on its legislative calendar, but the
date of the bill's initial consideration in the Senate remains unclear.<P>

Other comp time proposals recently have been offered by President Clinton and
members of the Senate. The president discussed his version of a comp time
proposal at a June 24 conference held in Nashville, Tenn. Also, legislation
similar to Ballenger's bill (S. 1129) was introduced Aug. 7, 1995, in the Senate
by Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo. (see September 1995 <i>Current Developments,</i>
Page 8). The Ashcroft legislation was referred to the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee.

<H2>Gag Rules: A Bad Storm Rising or A Mild Summer in a Teapot?</H2>
<H3>by C Keith Powell, Esq.</H3>
Recently &quot;gag rules&quot; -- limits on provider communication in managed
care organization (MCO) and insurance company contracts -- have received
much unfavorable publicity. Several states -- including Massachusetts, New
York, Maryland, and Georgia -- have passed legislation prohibiting MCOs,
insurance companies, or other entities from forbidding providers from discussing
treatment options with patients. Federal legislation also is being considered.<BR>
<BR>
It has been suggested that the public health and safety demand nothing less
than allowing providers, without restriction, to make any statements whatsoever,
including slander against the MCO and disclosure to competitors of proprietary
information. If this destroys managed care, so much the better, according
to the popular press. After all, managed care supposedly is killing people,
forcing fine doctors into disreputable behaviors that they are somehow helpless
to resist, and generally undermining society. [See &quot;Media Perspectives
of Gag Clauses,&quot; below.]<BR>
<BR>
A problem arises when one asks to see provider contract provisions that
specifically restrict physicians in their discussions of treatment options.
While everyone has heard of them, it is impossible to locate a provision
that has the effect of preventing the discussion of treatment options. A
common provision often alleged to prevent the discussion of treatment options
is that of U.S. Healthcare [see &quot;Gag Clauses -- Before and After,&quot;
below], which was the basis for the Time magazine article that gave recent
impetus to much of the public furor over gag rules.<BR>
<BR>
The majority of the statements that, on the surface, go further toward explicit
limits on treatments are &quot;pre-certification&quot; rules intended to
avoid dangerous and unnecessary treatments, and have operated in that fashion.
Even these statements have been pared back willingly - usually even unilaterally
- by MCOs in response to recent publicity on gag rules. The reason why MCOs
are so willing to clarify that these provisions do not limit discussion
of treatment options is simply that they were never operated in such a way
in the first place, and would be unenforceable were such an effort made.
<H4>The MCO Perspective</H4>
First, consider a hypothetical version of the gag rule that would try to
prevent a physician from discussing treatment options with a patient. Such
a rule would almost surely be legally unenforceable as counter to public
policy and probably inconsistent with informed consent laws. <BR>
<BR>
Also, personal injury law is flexible and capable of responding to new situations
by inventing new wrongs to be redressed. An effort to prevent discussion
of treatment options would likely expose the MCO to a dangerous new claim.
Beyond legal issues, the public relations effect would be devastating. Ethical
providers would abandon the MCO in large numbers and form competitors.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, this prohibition does not apply to proper managed care procedures,
for example, pre-certification requirements. Properly applied, these managed
care procedures not only prevent injury and death through unnecessary and
inappropriate procedures but also (via cost savings creating lower premiums)
make all health care services available to people who would not otherwise
have them without managed care. MCOs should aggressively pursue all appropriate
managed care procedures and should resist any efforts to claim that such
procedures are attempts to keep physicians from discussing treatment options
with patients.<BR>
<BR>
Second, consider confidentiality and antidisparagement clauses. Any business
needs to protect against the improper disclosure of information that could
damage the business and against slander of the company. These are ancient
rights that, to a great extent, already exist in common and statutory law,
and their proper inclusion in provider contracts not only maximizes protection
of these valuable rights but also puts providers on notice that proper,
ethical behavior is expected. <BR>
<BR>
Beyond the needs of the average business, such as a fried chicken fast-food
chain (which tries to protect its &quot;secret herbs and spices&quot; and
fights dishonest claims that its food is not fit to eat), the MCO has an
especially strong need for such protection. The provider supply situation
plus hostile legislation, such as any willing provider laws, puts the MCO
in the unusual situation of being forced to deal, supposedly on a partnership
basis, with providers of services who are openly hostile to the MCO and
would like to see managed care destroyed so that they can return to the
days of fee-for-service.<BR>
<BR>
On this distinctly unlevel playing field (in which the MCO's worst enemies
can force it to do business with them, but it has no such power to force
a physician to contract with it), the MCO needs all available power to force
providers to behave in a way that respects its confidential information
and does not disparage it. When the MCO is forced to deal with physicians
who claim that confidentiality and antidisparagement clauses keep them from
discussing treatment options with patients, and that managed care is forcing
them to practice experiemental surgery, the MCO needs all the help it can
get. Every MCO should use confidentiality and antidisparagement clauses
to the maximum permitted extent to give themselves as much of the protection
as possible that other businesses - including health care providers - have.
<H4>The Specialty Care Provider Perspective</H4>
First, specialists need to be sure of what they think they see in the MCO's
contract. Most gag rule language has every appearance of legitimately protecting
MCOs from improper disclosure of confidential information and disparagement.
There is no evidence of attempts to enforce them in any other way. The great
majority of the accusations of such behavior comes from sources with a strong
antimanaged care bias and fall apart quickly under scrutiny; the very few
others are &quot;maybes&quot; at best, and unenforceable and ineffective
at that.<BR>
<BR>
Second, the best way of avoiding problems with required but unacceptable
contract provisions is to refuse to do business with their purveyors. MCOs
cannot force specialists to contract with them. A specialist can certainly
continue to practice on a fee-for-service basis. If the specialists prefers
to work with MCOs, he or she can find a different one, maybe one that is
provider owned. If there is no other MCO in the area, or none without offensive
contract provisions, the specialist can get together with other physicians
equally offended by the provisions and start their own MCO. If few or no
other physicians are so offended, the specialist should consider re-examining
his or her interpretation of the MCO provisions and behaviors to be sure
that the perception is reasonable.<BR>
<BR>
If the specialists wish to do business with an MCO that they feel is insisting
on an improper contractual provision, talk to the MCO. All evidence suggests
that they are sensitive to specialists' concerns and may be willing to change
the provision. Even if they are not willing to change the provision in all
provider contracts (possibly because they believe that most physicians interpret
it differently), they might change it in this case. If this sounds naive,
consider that when Dr. Himmelstein found the provision of U.S. Healthcare
offensive, he supposedly crossed it out before signing, and the amended
contract was accepted without complaint. U.S. Healthcare did not seem to
consider the entire matter very important, and other MCOs seem to agree.<BR>
<BR>
While specialists should not commit contract fraud, it is always possible
that in a rare situation they could find themselves confronted with a contract
situation that they did not previously know existed at the time that they
were forced to make a decision on the mater being addressed. Under these
conditions specialists should recall that the courts will try to enforce
public policy in favor of communication on legitimate areas such as treatment
options. <BR>
Specialists will probably find shelter under the informed consent laws of
their state. A number of states have enacted legislation specifically to
protect the right to discuss treatment options. Statutes and strong public
policy generally override contract provisions in conflict. Specialists can
certainly count on the press and politicians being on their side on this
issue. Of course, this is not a recommendation to use this line of reasoning
to commit fraud against an MCO by knowingly accepting such contract provisions
and later claiming ignorance of them.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, specialists should try to be fair and reasonable. MCOs have very
low profit margins, and exist in an extremely competitive environment. They
have to deal with many specialists who would like to see their organizations
fail. Specialists would not want others disclosing their confidential business
information or disparaging they, and they should not mind agreeing not to
disclose the MCO's confidential business information or disparage it. <BR>
<BR>
It is not true, as some try to claim, that the terms &quot;confidential
information&quot; and &quot;disparagement&quot; can mean anything. Such
terms in provider contracts will be construed strictly against the drawer
of the contact and liberally in favor of the public policy supporting a
patient's right to such information. Particularly in the legal setting,
it is almost unimaginable that these concepts could be confused with doctor-patient
discussions of treatment alternatives, particularly given the informed consent
laws and relevant public policy. To a great extent, clauses on confidential
information and disparagement only reflect existing legal rights, and they
are eminently reasonable in the environment in which MCOs have to operate.
<BR>

<H3>Media Perspectives of Gag Clauses</H3>
1. &quot;What's needed is not just protection for doctors from gag orders,
but protection from consumers against the werewolves who may lurk in the
shadows of managed care.&quot; [&quot;Consumers Need Protection From Managers
of Managed Care,&quot; by Laurel Shackelford, the [Louisville?] Courier-Journal,
June 2, 1996, Sec. d page 2.]<BR>
This is the end of an article, the body of which covers the testimony of
a physician who in 1987 &quot;caused the death of a man&quot; when as an
&quot;executive physician&quot; with an HMO she &quot;denied him a necessary
operation to save his heart.&quot; Note that the MCO was blamed even though
it hired a physician to determine if requested surgery was necessary, and
the physician then supposedly decided to label as unnecessary an operation
that was, in fact, necessary.<BR>
<BR>
2. &quot;Today MCOs allow primary care physicians to make the treatment
decisions rather than having them approved by physicians directly on staff
with the MCO. Things are much worse now than when such procedures had to
be cleared with the MCO, because today the primary care physician is no
longer a patient advocate and is likely to deny care in order to reduce
costs.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
This a paraphrased statement made by a physician explaining that while MCOs
were once blamed for requiring approval by a physician at the staff level
for care that the primary care physician wanted to give, they should now
be blamed for giving full authority to the primary care physician.<BR>
<HR>
<H3>Gag Clauses -- Before and After</H3>
<I>U.S. Healthcare's original gag clause, which became the subject of media
attention, reads:</I><BR>
Physicians shall agree not to take any action or make any communication
which undermines or could undermine the confidence of enrollees, potential
enrollees, their employers, their unions, or the public in U.S. Healthcare
or the quality of U.S. Healthcare coverage. Physicians shall keep the Proprietary
Information [payment rates, utilization review procedures, etc.] and this
Agreement strictly confidential.<BR>
<BR>

(1) Physician shall have the right and is encouraged to discuss with his
or her patients pertinent details regarding the diagnosis of the patient's
condition, the nature and purpose of any recommended procedure, the potential
risks and benefits of any recommended treatment, and any reasonable alternatives
to such recommended treatment.<BR>
<BR>
(2) Physician's obligations not to disclose Proprietary Information do not

<title> Public Employer's Guide to FLSA Employee Classification </title>

<h2>Courts Base FLSA Rulings Against State Workers on <i>Seminole</i>
Decision</h2>

Two district courts recently dismissed claims filed by state employees against
their employers under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), ruling that the U.S.
Supreme Court's decision in <i>Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida,</i> 116 S.
Ct. 1114 (1996), protected states from private actions by state employees
brought in federal court.<P>

In <i>Seminole,</i> a five-justice majority of the Court struck down a provision
of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) (25 U.S.C. &#167;2710(d)(7)), which
was passed by Congress under the Indian Commerce Clause of the U.S.
Constitution. The provision required states to negotiate in good faith with
Native American tribes to enter into tribal-state compacts governing conduct of
gaming activities on Indian reservations. The provision also gave federal courts
jurisdiction over causes of action brought by Native American tribes to enforce
the states' obligation to negotiate such compacts.<P>

Pursuant to the provision, the <i>Seminole</i> tribe sued the state of Florida and its
governor for injunctive relief to force the governor and the state to enter into
negotiations for a tribal-state compact on gaming. However, the Supreme Court
ruled that Florida and its governor were immune from such a suit pursuant to the
11th Amendment.<P>

<h3>Highway Patrol Employees</h3>

In <i>Whitesell v. Moore,</i> No. 5:96-CV-292-BR2 (E.D.N.C. Aug. 14, 1996),
Robert Whitesell, an employee of the North Carolina State Highway Patrol, filed
charges against the state and the state's secretary of crime control and public
safety, claiming he was misclassified as exempt under the FLSA and was owed
compensation for overtime hours worked for the department. Citing several court
rulings, the department asked the court to dismiss Whitesell's claims, arguing
that the 11th Amendment barred FLSA claims against a state government.<P>

For example, relying on the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Edelman v.
Jordan,</i> 415 U.S. 651 (1974), the defendants argued that a state's own
citizens or the citizens of another state may not file suit against the state
for money damages under the 11th Amendment. The defendants said that the 4th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in <i>Gray v. Laws,</i> 51 F.3d 426 (1995),
extended this protection to state officers acting in their official capacity.
Further, the defendants said, in <i>Seminole,</i> the Supreme Court held that
states "may not be sued in federal court unless they consent to it in
unequivocal terms or unless Congress, pursuant to a valid exercise of power,
unequivocally expresses its intent to abrogate the immunity."<P>

The district court in <i>Whitesell</i> noted that Congress passed the FLSA under
its authority granted in the Interstate Commerce Clause of the Constitution.
However, the Court in <i>Seminole</i> "overruled prior case law and held that
'Article I [the Interstate Commerce Clause] cannot be used to circumvent the
constitutional limitation placed upon federal jurisdiction,'" the district court
stated.<P>

Moreover, because the FLSA was established under Congress' Interstate Commerce
Clause authority, the law cannot dismiss the state's 11th Amendment immunity.
"Plaintiff cannot raise his claim against defendants, a state and its officer
acting in his official capacity, in this court," the district court ruled.<P>

The plaintiff acknowledged that <i>Seminole</i> prevented "Congress from granting him a
right to sue defendants." However, he argued that the state and its official
"implicitly" relinquished their immunity under the 11th Amendment "by choosing
to comply with FLSA and causing its employees to legitimately rely on that
compliance."<P>

To decide the question, the district court again turned to the <i>Seminole</i>
decision. The Supreme Court in <i>Seminole</i> held that to determine whether
Congress properly has abrogated the states' sovereign immunity, two questions
must be asked:<P>
(1) has Congress unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate the immunity;
and<P>
(2) has Congress acted pursuant to a valid exercise of power?<P>

Using this standard, the court concluded that the state's compliance with the
FLSA was not voluntary, but required by Congress. The district court therefore
found that "defendants have not 'unequivocally' waived their 11th Amendment
immunity."<P>

<h3>New York State Employees</h3>

In the second case, <i>Close v. State of New York,</i> No. 94-CV-0906, 1996 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 12330 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 19, 1996), 404 employees of the state alleged
they were not paid for overtime hours worked under the FLSA. They sought
compensation for the overtime, liquidated damages and attorneys' fees.<P>

In February 1996, the U.S. District Court for Northern New York issued a
memorandum decision and order holding that the state had violated the FLSA for
not properly compensating its employees for overtime hours worked. However, the
state recently filed a motion to dismiss the case and vacate the previous ruling
under the Supreme Court's <i>Seminole</i> finding, claiming the district court
did not have jurisdiction to hear the case.<P>

The state employees argued that the <i>Seminole</i> decision did not change a
state's responsibilities under the Interstate Commerce Clause; <i>Seminole</i>
only dismissed states' 11th Amendment immunity under the Indian Commerce Clause,
the plaintiffs said. However, the court stated that "the Indian Commerce Clause
is a greater transfer of power from the states to the federal government than is
the Interstate Commerce Clause," and dismissed that portion of the employees'
argument.<P>

Responding to the employees' second claim that the state had relinquished its
immunity by consenting to the suit, the court responded that "judicial
recognition of constructive waiver has been extremely rare." Only when Congress
clearly indicates its intent to make states responsible in federal court for
certain actions, and the state "voluntarily chooses" to undertake such actions,
can states waive their 11th Amendment immunity, the court noted. "This is not a
situation where a state knew beforehand that an inevitable cost of engaging in
an activity and deriving its benefits was consent to be sued," the court
ruled.<P>

The plaintiffs also claimed that the <i>United States Code</i> allowed actions
under the FLSA "against an employer (including a public agency) in any federal
or state court of competent jurisdiction" (29 U.S.C. &#167;216(b)), calling into
question the constitutionality of the FLSA as it applies to states. Therefore,
according to plaintiffs, the U.S. Attorney General must certify the FLSA
constitutionality issue before the court can proceed. The district court
responded that "because the constitutional issue is so clear in this case
following the Supreme Court's ruling in <i>Seminole Tribe,</i> however, there is
no reason for the court to await the outcome of the certification."<P>

The district court followed the <i>Seminole</i> ruling, stating that it "no
longer [had] subject-matter jurisdiction over the state's violation of the Fair
Labor Standards Act," and vacated its memorandum decision against the state.<P>

<h3>Implications of the <i>Seminole</i> Decision</h3>

In light of the <i>Seminole</i> case, it appears that state employees may no
longer bring FLSA suits in federal court against their employers. The
<i>Whitesell</i> and <i>Close</i> decisions illustrate this assumption. Absent
the state's consent, such suits arguably violate the 11th Amendment to the
Constitution. Whatever the final result, the 11th Amendment immunity argument
poses some excellent grounds to dismiss pending federal cases, although private
actions presumably still may be brought in state courts.

<html> <title>Device BIMO Inspections Continue to Stress Data Integrity Issues<p></title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/food/clin/clinhead.gif" alt="Guide to Good Clinical Practice">
<P>
<h2>Device BIMO Inspections Continue to Stress Data Integrity Issues<p></h2>
<body>

Medical device sponsors and researchers need to be mindful of both the basic
parameters of FDA clinical research regulations and of the specific requirements
for their types of products -- particularly given the agency's emphasis on
fraudulent submissions under its applications integrity policy (AIP), according
to Charma Konnor, the new director of bioresearch monitoring (BIMO) within the
Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH).<p>

In an exclusive interview with the <i>Monthly Bulletin</i>, Konnor explained that small
device firms in particular need to focus on FDA regulations and guidance for
conducting and managing device clinical trials, if they want to avoid potential
product approval delays due to AIP violations.<p>

"From what I've seen, particularly smaller firms need access to information so
they can comply," Konnor said. "Under the applications integrity policy if these
firms don't have the right guidance they can suffer financially."<p>

<h3>AIP Basics</h3><p>

The AIP is an overreaching FDA compliance policy guide formally entitled "Fraud,
Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities" issued in
1991 (CPG 7150.09, see App. III). Under the policy, the FDA can investigate and
require corrective actions by product sponsors if they have submitted false or
misleading information to the agency related to a product application.<p>
"From a bioresearch monitoring standpoint, our core concerns are the quality and
integrity of the data," Konnor said. "The next step in integrity is fraud ...
we're talking about altered data, data that [are] omitted on purpose or data
that [are] fabricated. We do find this and it is something we do look for," she
added.<p>

Konnor affirmed that because submission errors or omissions often reflect
underlying deviations in clinical trial conduct, record keeping or monitoring,
an AIP-related violation often can trigger FDA actions against clinical
investigators and institutional review boards (IRBs), in addition to a rejection
of a product application.<p>

<h3>Common Deviations</h3><p>

Often related to AIP violations are the following common deviations by device
sponsors, IRBs and clinical investigators that occur during the course of
clinical trials, which Konnor said closely parallel those found in drug related
studies:<p>

<ol><li>Informed consent -- Both a failure to obtain and document consent or to do
so in a timely manner (before study enrollment) (21 CFR &#167;812.150, see App.
II for all sites);<p>

<li>Failure to notify IRBs and FDA of protocol changes -- Failure of clinical
investigators to inform their sponsor, IRB and the FDA of substantial changes
that impact on the scientific basis or safety of their study  (21 CFR
&#167;812.150(4));<p>

<li>Record keeping problems -- Compliance by device sponsors, IRBs and clinical
investigators with the FDA's applicable record-keeping requirements,
particularly in documenting informed consents, and in filing progress and change
reports and adverse event reports (21 CFR Subpart G).</ol><p>
Konnor added that many such violations found during FDA inspections reflect
sloppiness in the transfer of data from patient records to case report forms, or
onto reports between the various parties responsible for the clinical trial (see
chart below).<p>


<center><img src="/tpg/food/clin/clinjuly1a.gif"></center><P>



<h3>Significant Risk Determination</h3><p>

Another concern, Konnor said is that many firms have difficulty making a proper

determination of whether a device is "significant risk" (SR) or "nonsignificant

risk" (NSR). <p>

SR devices require approval of an application for investigational device (IDE)

by the FDA, but no such approval is needed for NSR products (see Information

Sheet: "Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies," App.

III).<p>

Konnor stressed that IRBs play a critical role in the SR/NSR determination,

after a sponsor has made an initial judgment. FDA regulations also require that

a sponsor notify the FDA if the IRB disagrees with its SR/NSR determination (21

CFR &#167;812.150(9)).<p>

"IRBs continue to improve their cuts on SR and NSR determinations," she said.

"But we continue to see enough insufficient SR and NSR determinations that this

still remains a concern to us and we're exploring how to get the word out."<p>

<h3>Device Accountability</h3><p>

Another important issue in device clinical trial management, Konnor said, is

accountability by sponsors and clinical investigators for investigational

products (21 CFR &#167;&#167;812.110, 812.150). Under the regulations, sponsors

and investigators must keep careful records of devices shipped, received,

administered, and left over during the course of a clinical trial (21 CFR

&#167;812.140, see App. II).<p>

"Accountability continues to be a problem," Konnor said. "Clinical investigators

and sponsors have a responsibility to know what they're shipping out ... how

many ... and who they are going to.<p>

"In some instances [devices] are being distributed beyond the agreed-upon

parameters of the study, beyond the patients enrolled in the study," she added.

"In other cases [the problem] can be people not keeping track of their study

articles.<p>

"The bottom line is those who assume responsibility for monitoring studies

should also be responsible ... for the devices they're handling," Konnor

said.<p>

<h3>IRB-specific Issues</h3><p>

Konnor said that leading problems for IRBs are approval of studies after

research has been initiated, and failure to conduct adequate continuing

reviews.<p>

"They're not all giving approval of studies before they have started --

sometimes it happens in reverse order," Konnor said. "In other studies we see no

approval -- period -- and the study is ongoing."<p>

Konnor added that other, leading operational issues include failure to conduct

annual continuing reviews, inadequate written procedures and poor record

keeping. In part, she said, these problems stem from IRB staffing issues.<p>

"Frankly, sometimes they don't have enough staffing or inappropriate staffing,"

Konnor said, echoing the concerns of her counterparts in the drug area. "What

we're talking about is people who can do the job that's necessary," she

said.<p>

<h3>Communication is Key</h3><p>

Although Konnor affirmed that her office continues to rigorously enforce the

agency's requirements, she stressed that greater emphasis is being placed on

promoting industry's voluntary compliance.<p>

Accordingly, Konnor said her office increasingly is relying on untitled letters,

rather than highly publicized Warning Letters or other enforcement actions. She

reported that her office has issued 21 untitled letters and six Warning Letters

for bioresearch violations since Oct. 1, 1995. "We are in an era now where we've

got to do this differently," Konnor said. <p>

"We are not shooting from the hip and sending Warning Letters just to generate

numbers," she added "We're trying to identify what the problems and the needs

are and then work with [industry] so they understand what their responsibilities

are."

<title> FLSA Employee Exemption Handbook </title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/person/file/filehead.gif" alt="FLSA Employee Exemption Handbook">
<P>
<h2>Computer Professional's Suit Centers on Worker's Duties</h2>
<h3><i>Court is Among First to Interpret Application of DOL's 1992
Rules</i></h3>

In one of the first Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) overtime suits to address
application of the special 1992 federal rules governing computer professionals,
the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently held that an employer did not
present enough evidence to prove that its technical writer/documenter was exempt
from the act.<P>

In 1992, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) issued rules (29 C.F.R.
&#167;541.303; see Appendix II of the <i>Handbook</i>) establishing strict
standards for determining when certain highly paid computer employees could
qualify for a special FLSA exemption for computer-related occupations. The 1992
rules provide a means of exempting such workers that is different from the
method of qualifying exempt administrators and executives under the traditional
"long" and "short" tests (see Tab 500).<P>

The plaintiff in the case, Stephen Bohn, worked as a technical writer/documenter
in the software and training departments of Park City Group Inc., and was paid
$47,000 annually. After the company terminated Bohn's employment for
inadequately performing his duties, he brought suit claiming he was improperly
denied overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek.<P>

The U.S. District Court for Utah granted Park City Group's motion for summary
judgment, ruling that Bohn was an exempt employee "because his primary duty was
as either a computer professional or an artistic professional." Bohn challenged
the ruling, and the appeals court reversed and remanded for trial the lower
court's decision.<P>

<h3>The Short Test for Professionals</h3>

Under the FLSA, employers generally must pay time and one-half overtime to an
employee for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek, unless the worker is
specifically employed in a "bona fide executive, administrative or professional
capacity" (29 U.S.C. &#167;207(a)(1)) or qualifies for another type of
exemption. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <i>Corning Glass Works v. Brennan</i>
(417 U.S. 188, 196-97 (1974)) that an employer bears the burden of proving an
employee's exempt status.<P>

FLSA regulations provide both a long test and short test for determining an
employee's exempt status as a professional. The level of Bohn's salary made him
subject to the short test, the 10th Circuit said.<P>

Under the short test for professionals, an employee must perform work that
requires the consistent exercise of discretion and independent judgment and
consists of one of the following:<P>
<UL>
<LI> work requiring advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning
customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual
instruction and study;<P>

<LI> teaching, tutoring, instructing or lecturing in the activity of imparting
knowledge as a teacher in the school system or educational establishment or
institution by which he is employed; or<P>

<LI> work that requires theoretical and practical application of highly
specialized knowledge in computer systems analysis, programming and software
engineering, and who is employed and engaged in these activities as a computer
systems analyst, computer programmer, software engineer or other similarly
skilled worker in the computer software field, as provided in
&#167;541.303.
</UL>

An employee also will meet the short test for professionals if his or her
primary duty consists of "work requiring invention, imagination, or talent in a
recognized field of artistic endeavor" (29 C.F.R. &#167;541.3).<P>

"The district court apparently found that based on undisputed facts, [Bohn's]
primary duty involved work either as a professional in an artistic endeavor or
as a computer professional," the appellate court said. Bohn, however, maintained
that the lower court erred in granting summary judgment to his employer because
questions of material fact remained concerning the duties he performed. He
argued that the nature of his duties did not qualify him for exemption under
DOL's 1992 rules.<P>

<h3>The 1992 Rules</h3>

DOL's 1992 rules recognize that expertise and skill required for the computer
professional exemption normally are attained through a combination of education
and experience in the field (29 C.F.R. &#167;541.303(c)). Consequently, in lieu
of a formal educational requirement, the rules list specific primary duties that
typical computer professionals perform. The rules (29 C.F.R. &#167;541.303(b))
state that a bona fide computer professional's primary work must involve at
least one of the following:<P>
<UL>
<LI> the application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including
consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
specifications;<P>

<LI> the design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or
modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and
related to user or system design specifications;<P>

<LI> the design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or<P>

<LI> a combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which
requires the same level of skills.<P>
</UL>

Bohn graduated from Southwest Missouri State University with a bachelor's degree
in elementary education, then earned 13 semester hours toward a master of arts
in educational media and technology at Brigham Young University. He also had
worked previously in the computer and instruction fields. This experience led
the appeals court to conclude that "[o]verall, [Bohn's] education and experience
allow but do not compel a finding that he had the skill and expertise required
to meet the computer professional exemption." Therefore, the court turned to
Bohn's primary duties to determine whether they met the requirements of 29
C.F.R. &#167;541.303(b).<P>

<h3>Bohn's Duties</h3>

Park City Group hired Bohn as a "documenter at the documentation project manager
level." The job description for the position contained several computer-related,
instructional and supervisory duties. Among them were the following:<P>
<UL>
<LI> being comfortable with several operating systems;<P>

<LI> producing innovative solutions for a variety of complex problems;<P>

<LI> guiding users in formulating requirements;<P>

<LI> arbitrating conflicts between individuals;<P>

<LI> reviewing the work of lower employees;<P>

<LI> formulating decisions on broad policy and standards issues; and<P>

<LI> demonstrating in-depth knowledge and understanding of the software
development business.<P>
</UL>

Bohn claimed that he did not perform the duties outlined in the description,
however. Instead, he maintained that he spent most of his time on "basic word
processing, photocopying, collating and talking with other employees, and
minimizing the amount of time he spent doing technical writing."<P>

This account contradicted an earlier affidavit he submitted in which he
testified that he performed many of the duties outlined in the job description.
The district court ruled that though Bohn may have performed many of the
clerical tasks, they "were not duties and responsibilities assigned to him."<P>

Bohn also argued that "his work did not require the highly specialized computer
skills described in [29 C.F.R. &#167;541.303(b)]." Park City Group had relied on
those rules to classify Bohn as exempt.<P>

"On their face, [Bohn's] duties and accomplishments appear to reflect high-level
skills, but without more we cannot determine whether they involve the depth of
knowledge the law requires for the professional exemption," the appeals court
said. The court also ruled that the district court had relied too heavily on the
level of Bohn's salary when it ruled he was a professional. "Based on the record
before us we cannot agree that [Park City Group] met [its] burden to show that
no issues of material fact remained on this question," the 10th Circuit held.<P>

The appellate court also examined the issue of Bohn's exemption as an artistic
professional, stating that "recognized fields of artistic endeavor include
'music, writing, the theater and the plastic and graphic arts.'" FLSA
regulations state that, when writing is considered, essayists, novelists and
scenario writers who chose their own subjects, and writers for advertising
agencies are considered artistic professionals (29 C.F.R. &#167;541.302(c)(2)).
"Given these regulations we doubt plaintiff's duties as a technical
writer/documenter could qualify for an artistic professional exemption," the
court said.<P>

The 10th Circuit ruled that the district court erred by granting Park City Group
summary judgment because issues of material fact remained pertaining to Bohn's
job duties. The appellate court reversed the lower court's decision and remanded
the case for trial. (<i>Bohn v. Park City Group Inc.,</i> No. 95-4086, 1996 U.S.
App. LEXIS 22626)

<h2>Computer Employee's Duties Focus of Exemption Case</h2>
<H3><I>Court is Among First to Interpret Application of DOL's 1992 Rules</I></H3>

In one of the first Fair Labor 	Standards Act (FLSA) overtime 	suits to
address application of the special 1992 federal rules governing computer
professionals, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held Aug. 28 that an
employer did not present enough evidence to prove that its technical
writer/documenter was exempt from the act.<P>

In 1992, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) issued rules (29 C.F.R.
&#167;541.303; see Appendix II) establishing strict standards for determining
when certain highly paid computer employees could qualify for a special FLSA
exemption for computer-related occupations. The 1992 rules provide a means of
exempting such workers that is different from the method of qualifying exempt
administrators and executives under the traditional "long" and "short" tests (see
Tab 200 of the <I>Handbook</I>).<P>

The plaintiff in the case, Stephen Bohn, worked as a technical writer/documenter
in the software and training departments of Park City Group, Inc., and was paid
$47,000 annually. After the company terminated Bohn's employment for inadequately
performing his duties, he brought suit claiming he was improperly denied overtime
pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek.<P>

The U.S. District Court for Utah granted the employer's motion for summary
judgment, ruling that Bohn was an exempt employee "because his primary duty was
as either a computer professional or an artistic professional." Bohn challenged
the ruling, and the appeals court reversed and remanded for trial the lower
court's decision.<P>

<H3>The Short Test</H3><P>

Under the FLSA, employers generally must pay time and one-half overtime to an
employee for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek, unless the worker is
employed in a "bona fide executive, administrative or professional capacity" or
is otherwise exempt from the act (29 U.S.C. &#167;207(a)(1)). FLSA regulations
provide both a long test and short test for determining whether an employee is an
exempt professional. The level of Bohn's salary made him subject to the short
test, the 10th Circuit said.<P>

Under the short test for professionals (29 C.F.R. &#167;541.3), an employee must
perform work that requires the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment and
consists of one of the following:<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>work requiring advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning
	customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual
	instruction and study; <P>

	<LI>teaching, tutoring, instructing or lecturing in the activity of imparting
	knowledge as a teacher in the school system or educational establishment or
	institution by which he is employed; or <P>

	<LI>work that requires theoretical and practical application of highly
	specialized knowledge in computer systems analysis, programming and software
	engineering, and who is employed and engaged in these activities as a computer
	systems analyst, computer programmer, software engineer or other similarly
	skilled worker in the computer software field, as provided in &#167;541.303.<P>
</UL>

An employee also will meet the short test for professionals if his or her primary
duty consists of "work requiring invention, imagination, or talent in a
recognized field of artistic endeavor" (29 C.F.R. &#167;541.3). <P>

A "good rule of thumb" for establishing an employee's primary duty, the court
noted, is to determine what task comprises at least 50 percent of an employee's
time. <P>

However, the court added, with regard to the short test, an employee's primary
duty is usually the task "that is of principal value to the employer" rather than
"collateral tasks" that may make up more than half the worker's time. Bohn
maintained that the lower court erred in granting summary judgment to his
employer because questions of material fact remained as to whether his primary
duty characterized him as a computer or artistic professional.<P>

<H3>The 1992 Rules</H3><P>

DOL's 1992 rules recognize that expertise and skill required for the computer
professional exemption normally are attained through a combination of education
and experience in the field (29 C.F.R. &#167;541.303(c)). Consequently, in lieu
of a formal educational requirement, the rules list specific primary duties
typical computer professionals perform. The rules (29 C.F.R. &#167;541.303(b))
state that a bona fide computer professional's primary duty must involve at least
one of the following:<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>the application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including
	consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
	specifications;<P>

	<LI>the design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or
	modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and
	related to user or system design specifications;<P>

	<LI>the design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer
	programs related to machine operating systems; or<P>

	<LI>a combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which
	requires the same level of skills.<P>
</UL>

The court found that Bohn possessed a bachelor's degree in elementary education
and had earned credit towards a master of arts in educational media and
technology. He also had worked previously in the computer and instruction fields.
This experience led the appeals court to conclude that "[o]verall, [Bohn's]

level." The job description for the position contained several computer related,
instructional and supervisory duties. Among them were the following:<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>being comfortable with several operating systems;<P>

	<LI>producing innovative solutions for a variety of complex problems;<P>

	<LI>guiding users in formulating requirements;<P>

	<LI>arbitrating conflicts between individuals;<P>

	<LI>reviewing the work of lower employees;<P>

	<LI>formulating decisions on broad policy and standards issues; and<P>

	<LI>demonstrating in-depth knowledge and understanding of the software
	development business.<P>
</UL>

In addition, a job description for Bohn's technical writing position provided,
among other things, that such an employee would need to optimize the expenditure
of company funds, have knowledge of trends in documentation techniques and
methods and be able to write and edit materials on a number of different subject
matters.  <P>

Bohn, however, claimed that he had not performed the duties outlined in the
descriptions. Instead, he maintained that he had spent most of his time on "basic
word processing, photocopying, collating and talking with other employees, and
minimizing the amount of time he spent doing technical writing."<P>

This account contradicted an earlier affidavit he submitted in which he testified
that he performed many of the duties outlined in the job descriptions. The
district court ruled that though Bohn may have performed many of the clerical
tasks, they "were not duties and responsibilities assigned to him." <P>

Bohn also argued that "his work did not require the highly specialized computer
skills described in [29 C.F.R. &#167;541.303(b)]." The company had relied on
those rules to classify Bohn as exempt. <P>

According to the appeals court, "[o]n their face, [Bohn's] duties and
accomplishments appear to reflect high level skills, but without more we cannot
determine whether they involve the depth of knowledge the law requires for the
professional exemption." <P>

The court also ruled that the district court may have relied too heavily on the
level of Bohn's salary when it ruled he was a professional. The court said the
employer "failed to provide the kind of detailed information" about Bohn's
primary duty and "the computer skill required in this area of 'high tech" work"
to allow a classification of the employee as a computer professional. <P>

<H3>The Artistic Professional Exemption</H3><P>

The appellate court also examined the issue of Bohn's artistic professional
exemption, stating that "recognized fields of artistic endeavor include 'music,
writing, the theater and the plastic and graphic arts.'" FLSA regulations state
that, when writing is considered, essayists, novelists and scenario writers who
chose their own subjects, and writers for advertising agencies are considered
artistic professionals (29 C.F.R. &#167;541.302(c)(2)). "Given these regulations
we doubt plaintiff's duties as a technical writer/documenter could qualify for an
artistic professional exemption," the court said.<P>

The 10th Circuit ruled that the district court erred by granting Park City Group
summary judgment because issues of material fact remained pertaining to Bohn's
job duties. The appellate court reversed the lower court's decision and remanded
the case for trial. (<I>Bohn v. Park City Group, Inc.</I>, 10th Cir., No. 95-4086, 1996
U.S. App. LEXIS 22626) <P>

<title>EEOC issues guide on coordinating ADA, workers' comp</title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<P>
<h2>EEOC issues guide on coordinating ADA, workers' comp</h2>


The EEOC issued new guidance in September on the ADA and workers' compensation laws, highlighting many
troublesome questions facing employers, including when they may refuse to return injured employees to
work, what they may ask and which reasonable accommodations they must provide after a work injury.
Throughout the guidance, the EEOC cautions employers that workers' compensation concerns and
determinations do not supersede ADA mandates.<P>

For example, workers' compensation costs may not be used to justify adverse employment actions against
individuals with disabilities, the EEOC asserts. But an employer may fire or refuse to hire a person who
would pose a direct threat. (The EEOC defines direct threat as posing a "significant risk of substantial harm
to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable
accommodation.")<P>

"Where an employer refuses to hire a person because it assumes, correctly or incorrectly, that, because of
a disability, s/he poses merely some increased risk of occupational injury (and, therefore, increased
workers' compensation costs), the employer discriminates against that person on the basis of disability,"
the EEOC states.<P>

The EEOC also maintains that employers may not rely exclusively on a workers' compensation
determination that an employee has a permanent or total disability when deciding if an employee is a
qualified individual with a disability covered under the ADA. (Several courts have rejected the EEOC's
similar position that representations of total disability for purposes of receiving disability benefits does not
bar ADA coverage (see p. 9).)<P>

However, it also asserts that such a determination may be relevant in assessing whether a worker can
perform essential functions with or without reasonable accommodation or return to work without posing a
direct threat.<P>

An employer also may not require that an employee with a disability-related work injury be able to work
"full duty" in order to return if full duty includes marginal functions and the employee can perform all
essential functions with or without a reasonable accommodation.<P>

Furthermore, the employer, rather than a rehabilitation counselor, physician or other specialist, must
determine whether an employee poses a direct threat, the EEOC states. But an employer may consult with
such specialists about an employee's functional limitations, abilities and possible reasonable
accommodations.<P>

<H3>Permitted questions and exams</H3><P>

An employer may ask disability-related questions or require a medical examination of an injured employee
if the questions and exams are job-related and consistent with business necessity. "This requirement is met
where an employer reasonably believes that the occupational injury will impair the employee's ability to
perform essential job functions or raises legitimate concerns about direct threat," the EEOC states. <P>

But the questions and exams must solely concern the work injury and its effect on the employee's ability to
perform essential job functions without posing a direct threat. <P>

An employer also may ask disability-related questions or require a medical exam of a worker with an
occupational injury to ascertain the extent of its workers' compensation liability, as long as the questions
and exams are "consistent with the state law's intended purpose of determining an employee's eligibility for
workers' compensation benefits."<P>

And if an employee with an occupational injury asks for a reasonable accommodation, the employer may ask
for documentation if the need for accommodation is not obvious. <P>

However, the EEOC cautions, "while the employer may require documentation showing that the employee
has a covered disability and stating his/her functional limitations, it is not entitled to medical records that
are unnecessary to the request for reasonable accommodation."<P>

<H3>Reasonable accommodation</H3><P>

For those workers with disability-related work injuries, an employer must provide reasonable
accommodations; relying solely on workers' compensation laws may violate the ADA. For example, an
employer's reasonable accommodation duty is not satisfied by placing an injured worker in a workers'
compensation vocational rehabilitation program, the EEOC provides.<P>

An employer does not have to accommodate every employee with a work injury, because not all work
injuries are covered by the ADA. (The ADA defines "disability" as an impairment that substantially limits a
major life activity, record of such impairment or being regarded as having such an impairment.)<P>

But the ADA prohibits an employer from discharging covered, injured employees who are temporarily
unable to work where it would not impose an undue hardship to provide leave as a reasonable
accommodation. (In addition, under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), private and public sector
employers of 50 or more employees must provide up to 12 workweeks of unpaid job-protected leave to
eligible employees for certain specified family and medical reasons, including a serious health
condition.)<P>

And if leave would pose an undue hardship, the employer must consider whether it would cause an undue
hardship for the employee to temporarily fill a vacant, equivalent position for which he or she is qualified.
If an equivalent position is not available, the employer must look for a vacant position at a lower level. If no
such position is available, continued leave is not required.<P>

While an employer also must reallocate marginal job duties as a reasonable accommodation, it may not
reassign a worker with a disability-related job injury without first trying to accommodate the worker in
his or her original job. <P>

Such accommodations might include modifying equipment or offering a part-time work schedule.
"Reassignment should be considered only when accommodation within the employee's original position is not
possible or would impose an undue hardship," the EEOC states. <P>

However, if accommodation in the original position is not possible, the employee must be reassigned to an
equivalent vacant position if available (and lower- graded position if not), as long as he or she is qualified
for the vacant job and no undue hardship results. The employer does not have to create a new position,
create a light duty position or "bump" another employee (see p. 12).<P>

An employer may provide an accommodation that requires a worker to remain on the job even if he or she
requests leave under the ADA. <P>

However, discriminatory leave policies are prohibited. The EEOC states "if an employee with a
disability-related occupational injury does not request a reasonable accommodation, but simply requests
leave that is routinely granted to other employees (e.g., accrued paid leave or leave without pay), an
employer may not require him/her to remain on the job with some type of adjustment unless it also
requires employees without disabilities who request such leave to remain on the job with some type of
adjustment."<P>

Moreover, the FMLA prohibits employers from requiring employees qualifying for FMLA leave to remain on
the job with an adjustment, the EEOC notes.<P>

<H3>Light duty</H3><P>

Although employers do not have to create light duty positions, the EEOC states that "in some cases, the only
effective reasonable accommodation available for an individual with a disability may be similar or
equivalent to a light duty position. The employer would have to provide that reasonable accommodation
unless the employer can demonstrate that doing so would impose an undue hardship."<P>

For example, if a worker is injured off-the-job, an employer may deny a request to create a light duty
position, but must still reasonably accommodate the worker (including reassigning marginal functions),
potentially resulting in a restructured job that resembles light duty.<P>

Although the ADA does not require the creation of light duty positions, it does not prohibit employers from
"making a workplace modification that is not a required form of reasonable accommodation under the ADA
for an employee with an occupational injury in order to offset workers' compensation costs," the EEOC
provides.<P>

However, it warns that a policy of creating light duty jobs for occupationally injured employees is
prohibited if it has an adverse impact on a class of individuals with disabilities and there is not a
job-related reason consistent with business necessity for the policy.<P>

Further, an employer that reserves light duty positions for employees with occupational injuries must
consider reassigning employees with disabilities who are not occupationally injured to such jobs as a
reasonable accommodation, the EEOC maintains. But if an employer has only temporary light duty positions,
it does not have to provide a permanent light duty position for a worker with a disability-related
occupational injury.<P>

The EEOC's guidance is included in this month's supplement.<P><HR>

<H4>Tips: Ensure the confidentiality of medical records<P></H4>

<FONT SIZE="2">Employers must maintain in separate medical files all information obtained from post-offer medical
examinations and disability-related inquiries. This includes medical information on an applicant's or
employee's occupational injury or workers' compensation claim. The EEOC recommends that employers keep
medical files in a separate, locked cabinet apart from where personnel files are stored and designate who
can have access to the file.<P>

A file's information may not be disclosed, except to:<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
		<LI>supervisors to inform them about necessary work restrictions or accommodations;<P>
	
		<LI>first aid and safety personnel, when appropriate, if the disability might require emergency treatment or procedures in case of fire or other evacuations; or<P>

		<LI>government officials investigating compliance with laws prohibiting discrimination based on disability.<P>
</UL>

An employer must keep medical information confidential even if someone is no longer an applicant or an
employee.<P>

Also, relevant information from a file may be disclosed to state workers' compensation offices or "second
injury" funds, and to insurance companies when they require a medical examination to provide health or life
insurance for employees.<P>

<html> <title> Officials may be liable for recommending former employee</title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/person/sink/sinkhead.gif" alt="Educator's Guide to Controlling Sexual Harassment">
<P>
<h2> School officials may be liable for recommending former employee who had history
of sexual misconduct</h2>
<body>
<P>
School authorities who recommended a former employee -- known to have engaged in
various types of sexual wrongdoing -- may be liable to a student enrolled at the
hiring school, the California Court of Appeal held Dec. 15. <P>

According to Randi W., a thirteen-year-old student of Livingston Middle School,
vice principal Robert Gadams "negligently and offensively touched, molested, and
engaged in sexual touching," while she was in his office. Prior to his employment
with Livingston Middle School, Gadams had been employed by various other school
districts from which he was allegedly forced to resign for sexual misconduct.<P>

Before he was hired by Livingston Middle School, Gadams obtained recommendations
from various individuals who worked for his former employers. Among these
individuals were Gilbert Rossette, an official in the Mendota School district,
where Gadams worked between 1985-1988; Richard Cole, an official of Tranquility
High School District and Golden Plains Unified School District, where Gadams was
employed between 1986-1990; and finally, Gary Rice and David J. Malcolm,
officials in the Muroc Joint Unified School District, where Gadams worked in or
around 1990 and 1991.<P>

While employed in the Mendota School District, Gadams allegedly was involved in
sexual misconduct with female students which, according to the complaint, was
known by Rossette. Despite this purported knowledge, in his recommendation of
Gadams, Rossette set out numerous positive aspects of Gadams' tenure in Mendota
and concluded that "I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Mr. Gadams for any
position!"<P>

Similarly, while employed by Golden Plains Unified School District, Gadams had
been the subject of various complaints by parents, which according to the
complaint, led to Gadams' "resigning under pressure from Golden Plains due to
sexual misconduct charges." Despite this situation, Cole recommended Gadams,
listing his various strong points as an instructor and administrator and stating
that "he would recommend him for almost any administrative position he wishes to
pursue."<P>

Gadams was also allegedly forced out of his next position, again for sexual
harassment of female students. Despite his alleged knowledge of this, David
Malcolm wrote of Gadams in his recommendation as "an upbeat, enthusiastic
administrator who relates well to the students" and who was "in large part"
responsible for the campus of the Boron Junior/Senior High School being "a safe,
orderly and clean environment for students and staff." Malcolm concluded that he
would recommend Gadams "for an assistant principalship or equivalent position
without reservation.<P>

Randi W. claims in her complaint that these recommendations were made "with
actual malice, corruption and actual fraud since these defendants knew the true
facts regarding Gadams and knew that an injury to a child by Gadams would
probably result." In accordance with this, Randi W. pursued theories of
negligence, negligent hiring, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, negligence per
se, and violation of Title IX. The lower court dismissed her complaint, ruling
that the facts alleged failed to establish that the above-named officials owed a
legal duty to her. Randi appealed to the California Court of Appeal.<P>

With respect to Randi's general negligence claim, the appeals court found that
there was no liability because the officials did not have a "special
relationship" with either Gadams or Randi at the time of the alleged molestation,
nor did they have any ability to control Gadams. Accordingly, the trial court's
ruling on this issue was affirmed. <P>

Similarly, the lower court did not err when it dismissed the "negligent hiring"
count, the court said, noting that it knew of no case that extended the negligent
hiring theory to a non-employing defendant. Nor did the lower court err when it
dismissed Randi's Title IX count, the court said. "Nothing in the language of
title IX . . . suggests that such a cause of action could extend to educational
institutions which have no direct relationship to the plaintiff," the court
wrote.<P>

However, with respect to the claims of negligent misrepresentation, fraud, and
negligence per se, the lower court erred when it dismissed Randi's complaint
without allowing her the right to amend her complaint so she could establish why
the officials owed any duty to her, the court ruled.<P>

<h3>Failure to disclose can equal misrepresentation</h3><P>

The court said that the failure to disclose certain information can constitute
misrepresentation and may also be interpreted as "the giving of false
information," as stated in California's tort law. While mere nondisclosure is
generally not actionable, quoting from <i>Rogers v. Warden</i>, 20 Cal.2d 286, 289
(1949), the court said that the law has long recognized that "although one may be
under no duty to speak as to a matter, if he undertakes to do so, either
voluntarily or in response to inquiries, he is bound not only to state truly what
he tells but also not to suppress or conceal any facts within his knowledge which
materially qualify those stated. If he speaks at all he must make a full and fair
disclosure." And, as stated in <i>Cicone v. URS Corp</i>., 183 Cal.App.3d 194, 201
(1986), "One who is asked for or volunteers information must be truthful, and the
telling of a half-truth calculated to deceive is fraud."<P>

Here, the recommendation letters were given to an educational placement office
and each made an unqualified recommendation for Gadams' employment in other
school positions, the court said. "In our opinion the facts allegedly known by
respondents, but not disclosed in the recommendation letters, 'materially
qualify' the facts disclosed about Gadams' conduct at the respondents' schools
and render the letters misleading half-truths," the court wrote. The court said
that under the circumstances as alleged here, California law protects third
parties, such as Randi. Accordingly, the court concluded that the officials owed
a duty to Randi not to negligently or intentionally misrepresent Gadams'
desirability to prospective employers. Thus, the facts as alleged in Randi's
complaint established an adequate duty to support both the negligent
misrepresentation and fraud counts, the court found. Further, California law
imposes on officials a duty to report known or reasonably suspected incidents of
child abuse. Because of this duty, the officials in this case had a mandatory
duty to report the acts committed by Gadams. Thus, Randi's claim of negligence
per se should not have been dismissed by the lower court without its granting her
leave to amend her complaint, the court ruled. (<i>Randi W. v. Livingston Union
School District</i>, Cal.Ct.App., No. F020849, Dec. 15, 1995) <P>

<H2>Structuring Specialty Care Capitation: Deciding Which Specialties to
Capitate to Maximize Savings</H2>
<H3>by John H. Straub</H3>
Managed care organization (MCO) administrators should not feel it is necessary
to capitate all of their specialty care provider networks just because it
is popular to capitate. Some of the best reimbursement strategies used by
MCOs capitate only 40 percent or less of specialty care providers. MCOs
should capitate specialty areas that produce the greatest savings with capitation
arrangements, and not all specialties are good candidates for utilization
savings.<BR>
<BR>
Specialty capitation should not be viewed as an &quot;all or nothing&quot;
proposition. There is no real advantage to capitating all the providers
in the network because some specialty practice areas cannot produce enough
utilization management savings to warrant capitation. These specialists
are better compensated through negotiated fee-for-service arrangements mutually
beneficial to both the MCO and the specialty care provider.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Careful Analysis Required</B><BR>
<BR>
In practice, capitation is neither desirable nor economically practical
when the need for a particular specialty service is limited to only a few
medical situations per year, especially when these incidences of illness
or episodes are not high-cost medical services and are short term. The decision
to capitate requires careful analysis of the network's overall utilization
experience and projection of future medical services. <BR>
<BR>
The types of medical episodes or diagnoses that are chronic - such as diabetes,
cardiac disease, or certain forms of cancer - are high maintenance and require
large doses of specialty care services. MCOs should review their utilization
experience, seeking out situations of high cost similar to those listed,
to begin the process of determining where medical utilization savings might
be created through capitation.<BR>
<BR>
Specialty capitation has grown in popularity because it has produced utilization
savings primarily from the viewpoint that specialists will find better ways
to diagnose and treat patients when they become responsible for the cost
of care under capitation risk contracts. Under the risk contract, the provider's
objective is to improve the patient's health more quickly without performing
a wide range of tests and treatments that produce only marginal results.
Using tests that look for &quot;outlier&quot; types of diagnoses are not
good candidates for front-line testing. Tests that identify the more common
diagnoses become the mode of practice under managed care.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Confusion Over Capitation's Role</B><BR>
<BR>
For many MCO administrators, health care providers, and specialists themselves,
there has been great confusion as to where capitation fits into the framework
of managed care. The greatest part of the confusion or misunderstanding
stems from the belief that managed care principles dictate that providers
must be reimburse through fully capitated contracts, and anything less is
not managed care. The other part of the myth is that capitation is managed
care and everything else, such as utilization management, quality assurance,
and provider access, are secondary to the development of a capitated reimbursement
system.<BR>
<BR>
This perception can be detrimental to the success of an MCO if the administrators
truly believe that profitability through decreased utilization and quality
will suddenly fall into place once all specialists are activated into a
fully capitated reimbursement system. Capitation cannot operate in a stand-alone
mode without the help of the other disciplines of managed care.<BR>
<BR>
The reality is that specialty care capitation is only one of the tools of
managed care, which, in combination with discounted fee-for-service arrangements
and other managed care tools, has the potential to create efficiency and
effectiveness within the provider network. Utilization management and quality
assurance combined with the appropriate provider reimbursement arrangement
create the total managed care environment.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Examine Several Variables</B><BR>
<BR>
MCO administrators must examine several variables to determine which network
specialists are good candidates for capitation and which specialists should
be compensated through a discounted fee schedule, or arrangement other than
capitation. If the variable analysis determine that no utilization savings
will be generated, the MCO will not capitate the specialist.<BR>
<BR>
The variables to examine in deciding which specialists should be capitated
include: 
<UL>
<LI>the frequency of utilization, 
<LI>the book of business being served, 
<LI>potential utilization savings, 
<LI>the supply of specialists, 
<LI>cost of treatment, and 
<LI>the types of diseases being treated. 
</UL>
Selecting the specialty care providers that will be capitated depends on
a careful analysis of all the above variables and their importance to the
MCO's service area.<BR>
<BR>
There is no one set of rules to dictate which group or type of specialists
can or cannot be capitated. Any specialty can be capitated. A good capitation
candidate will depend on the needs of the MCO seeking to contract for specialty
care services. Generally, subspecialists in narrowly defined fields will
not be considered good candidates for capitation, because little utilization
cost savings can be realized when the incidence of utilization is so low.<BR>
<B><BR>
Realizing Utilization Savings</B><BR>
<BR>
Utilization savings can be realized for both the MCO and the specialty care
provider in a number of ways. For the MCO, utilization savings can occur
when the specialty care provider follows established protocols set by the
MCO that suggest patterns of treatment to assist the patient in healing
faster or to prevent additional illness through preventive care practices.
An example of preventive care is to educate the MCO's members to initiate
exercise and dietary programs that may assist in keeping members out of
inpatient settings.<BR>
<BR>
Other utilization savings can be realized by the MCO when specialists reduce
unnecessary testing that does not fall under the specialist's capitation
arrangement. Reducing costs in areas of medical treatment not under the
responsibility of the capitation agreement sets up the potential for the
MCO to reward the specialist with incentive payments. MCOs have learned
that utilization savings increase dramatically when incentives represent
a major piece of the capitation reimbursement package. In some of the more
effective reimbursement plans, the incentives pay more than the monthly
per member per month capitation rates.<BR>
<BR>
Specialty care providers realize utilization savings when they reduce the
amount of unnecessary testing for which they are responsible under the terms
of the capitated contract. The fewer tests done means additional savings
to their practice. They also realize utilization savings when MCOs include
incentive plans that may pay bonuses for holding bed days per 1,000 below
a targeted amount.<BR>
<BR>
From the MCO's perspective, there is no economic advantage to enter into
a capitation agreement with certain specialty providers if there is little
or no demand for the specialist's services or if no utilization savings
can be realized. Reaching the conclusion that there will not be much demand
or savings from utilization savings for a given specialty service, however,
is not always a clear-cut decision. Predicting utilization frequency can
be difficult.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Decisions Based on Past Experience</B><BR>
<BR>
The MCO's decision to contract under capitation becomes even more difficult
in situations in which the membership is constantly growing and changing
along with the needs for different medical services. The MCO can never be
sure which specialists may be in demand from one year to the next. MCOs
will usually capitate for services that are most commonly needed in their
service areas based on past experience of incidence and regional projections
furnished by consulting actuaries.<BR>
<BR>
Studies of utilization practices also have assisted MCOs in determining
where savings can be realized in certain specialty practices. MCO utilization
management teams have shown that there are certain specialties that can
exercise greater utilization control than other specialty practices. MCOs
will target those specialties and offer capitation reimbursement plans combined
with incentive programs to reduce waste and realize medical savings in the
delivery of health care. [See <I>To Capitate or Not to Capitate - That Is
the Specialty</I> below.]<BR>
<BR>
Pediatric neurologists, as an example, probably would not be capitated in
a commercial book of business because their medical services are used infrequently
compared to the total medical services of the total patient or membership
base participating in the MCO. The need for a pediatric neurologist on a
full time or fully dedicated basis would not be that tremendous and the
utilization savings are generally not that significant under this type of
specialty. The MCO would therefore seek a specialist of this type outside
the network on the spot market or contract within the network on a discounted
fee-for-service arrangement.<BR>
<BR>
Under a Medicaid risk contract, however, it may be appropriate to capitate
a pediatric neurologist. The frequency of illness requiring the neurologist's
services may be greater than under a commercial plan, since the members
of most Medicaid programs are predominately children.<BR>
<BR>
MCOs should weigh all the variables to determine the most appropriate capitation
reimbursement package suitable to their demographic service area to produce
the best results in terms of profitability and quality of care.<BR>
<HR>
<H2><CENTER>To Capitate or Not to Capitate - That Is the Specialty</CENTER>
</H2>
Cost of service and the ability to control utilization play important roles
in the MCO's decision to capitate a particular specialty. The following
specialties are the best candidates for capitation, as they tend to be high
cost and offer the potential of increased savings through capitation agreements:
<UL>
<LI>allergy, 
<LI>cardiology, 
<LI>dermatology, 
<LI>gastroenterology 
<LI>general surgery, 
<LI>oncology, 
<LI>opthalmology, 
<LI>optometry, 
<LI>orthopedcs, 
<LI>otolaryngology, 
<LI>pathology, 
<LI>plastic surgery, 
<LI>psychiatry, 
<LI>radiology, and 
<LI>urology. 
</UL>
The following specialties tend to be lower cost or have fewer opportunities
to realize utilization savings and tend to be excluded from capitation agreements:
<UL>
<LI>anesthesiology, 
<LI>cardiac surgery, 
<LI>chiropractic care, 
<LI>endocrinology, 
<LI>hematology, 
<LI>nephrology, 
<LI>neurosurgery, 
<LI>obstetrics/gynecology, 
<LI>oral surgery, 
<LI>podiatry, and 
<LI>pulmonology. 
</UL>
The HMO Warren Surveys identify the following specialties as the ones most
often capitated: 
<UL>
<LI>allergy, 
<LI>cardiology, 
<LI>dermatology, 
<LI>general surgery, 
<LI>opthalmology, 
<LI>orthopedics, 
<LI>otolaryngology, 
<LI>psychiatry, 
<LI>radiology, and 
<LI>urology.

<html> <title>FDA Stalls in Finalizing Investigator Financial Disclosure
Rule</title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/food/clin/clinhead.gif" alt="Guide to Good Clinical Practice">
<P>
<h2>FDA Stalls in Finalizing Investigator Financial Disclosure Rule</h2>
<body>

The FDA continues to face discordant objections of industry and academic

researchers over its proposed clinical investigator financial disclosure rule,

prompting some experts to question whether or not a final rule will be issued at

all. <p>

During a March 29 meeting, the FDA Science Committee sought further input from

interested parties, eliciting diverse objections within the research community,

particularly between industry and academic researchers. <p>

"I wouldn't be surprised if they don't go forward at all because of the

confusion and diversity of opinion on this issue," Marlene Tandy, director and

counsel at the Health Industry Manufacturers Association (HIMA) said during a

follow-up interview. Tandy believes the agency also has had to reconsider its

proposal because of the vast burden and complexity the agency itself would face

if the rule were implemented in its present form. <p>

"I think . . . they realize the proposed rule is too far out there," Tandy said.

"I am hoping that the FDA's management officers want the agency to go in a

different direction." <p>

<h3>Slow Progress </h3><p>

The FDA's path in issuing a final rule has meandered through two Science Board

meetings and one public hearing (held July 20, 1995) since the proposed

financial disclosure rule was published in the Sept. 22, 1994 <i>Federal

Register</i> (59 FR 48708, see App. III; "Industry Assails Sweeping Financial

Disclosure Rule," September 1995, p. 4). In addition to numerous testimonies,

the FDA received 47 comments on the proposed rule, many of which sharply

criticized the agency for imposing burdensome and unnecessary requirements. <p>

At the center of the debate for both the FDA and the research community is

whether or not a "threshold" for disclosure of financial interests should be

used, and, if so, how such information ought to be reported to the agency. Other

issues for researchers include what the agency will do with collected

information and how it will proceed in determining whether or not an "undue

influence" exists in a scientific study. <p>

As published, the proposed rule would oblige investigators to provide their

institutions with detailed information on equity interests that exceed $5,000 or

5 percent of the holdings of a publicly traded company sponsoring the research

(59 FR 48708, see App. II). This is a substantially lower threshold than that

used in a similar final rule of the Public Health Service (PHS), which

establishes a reporting requirement for equity interests or remuneration of at

least $10,000 (see 60 FR 35810, see App. V; "PHS, NSF Finalize Investigator

Disclosure Rules," September 1995," p. 6; ). The PHS rule requires only that

individual conflicts be reported internally before the grant award, while the

FDA proposed rule requires investigator certifications during the trial

selection process. <p>

<h3>Rescission Retreat </h3><p>

Although reportedly few details of the agency's progress were revealed at the

meeting, one positive determination made by the FDA is a decision not to

prohibit outright or require divestment of certain financial interests. An

agency background paper released by the Science Board states that the FDA has

"decided against" prohibiting any financial interests or requiring investigator

divestiture. <p>

"FDA concluded that such a prohibition would disproportionately and unfairly

penalize certain sponsors such as small device and biotechnology firms," the

backgrounder states. <p>

<h3>Industry Outcry </h3><p>

The signs of a more moderate approach at the FDA may reflect the vociferous

protests of industry groups, which have been concerned partly because the FDA

does not presently review any financial information of private U.S. firms. <p>

"This is a very tricky one and we are potentially impacted more than other

industries," Alan Goldhammer of the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO)

told the <i>Monthly Bulletin. </i><p>

"There are some forms of compensation that are a potential problem," Goldhammer

conceded, but he added that the rule, as proposed, would be far more burdensome

than necessary and likely would have a serious impact on start-up biotech firms.

<p>

Similarly, HIMA's Tandy said that device sponsors are concerned about an

overwhelming burden if the proposed rule is finalized in its present form. She

explained that the rule, if ever finalized, should be streamlined through the

use of a far higher threshold (of $25,000) and a simple "check-off" procedure to

indicate the presence of a potential conflict of interest. <p>

<h3>Mixed Academic Support </h3><p>

As compared to industry researchers, federally funded researchers appear to have

fewer reservations toward an FDA disclosure rule because they already are

subject to the PHS final rule. As a result, federal grantees are pushing for

harmonization of the FDA proposal and the PHS final rule. <p>

"We need a uniform federal system for conflict of interest," David Blake, M.D.,

of the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC), told the Monthly

Bulletin. Blake added that the proposed rule would create excessive burdens for

both researchers and the FDA, which would have little need for the reports in

most cases. <p>

"FDA has said that, in reality, they need this information only in a small

percentage of cases," he said. <p>

Blake explained that his organization, like HIMA, also favors a simple

"check-off" disclosure process whereby investigators would indicate whether or

not a financial interest exists. Blake proposed that if a financial interest

exists and the FDA determines that findings of a particular trial are unusually

favorable, then the agency would be able to request more detailed information,

evaluate the potential for bias, and weight their evaluation of the clinical

evidence accordingly. <p>

Blake also suggested that the FDA-proposed requirement for up-front, full

disclosure of equity interests above the threshold is problematic because the

FDA's intentions and internal procedures are not entirely clear. <p>

"FDA has never told us what they're going to do with this information," Blake

said. "It would be a great mistake for FDA reviewers to see this information and

then be biased in their review of the application." <p>

<h3>Threshold Debate </h3><p>

Like Tandy, Blake and other academicians also favor a higher disclosure

threshold.  <p>

"People have underestimated the size of this burden," Blake said. "The biggest

problem is to try to unburden the system by having a fairly high <i>de

minimus</i> value." <p>

Another area of agreement between academic and industry researchers appears to

exist in the timing of investigator disclosures. Although the FDA proposes that

companies submit certifications along with the new drug application (NDA), the

proposed rule also requires that these certifications be based on disclosures

obtained from investigators at the time they are selected for the clinical

trial. The PHS rule, in contrast, requires only that investigators submit a list

of potentially conflicting financial interests by the time the institution

submits its grant application. <p>

"I think it's clear that a 'just in time' regulation is more appropriate," Blake

said. <p>

<h3>FDA Disagrees </h3><p>

The FDA has issued no official indication of its intentions in revising the

proposed rule, but Office of Drug Evaluation 1 Director Robert Temple, M.D.,

indicated to the <i>Monthly Bulletin </i>that he believes the agency has a

legitimate purpose in pursuing the rule. Although Temple offered no predictions

as to the final content of the rule, he did say that there is a willingness to

consider revising the reporting threshold. <p>

However, Temple disagreed that the meeting represented diverse opinions on how

the disclosures should be implemented. <p>

"The people who testified at this meeting were not so far apart on this, I was

struck by that," Temple said.<p>

When asked whether or not the FDA is considering a rule that would harmonize

disclosure requirements with those of the PHS, Temple ruled out any possibility

of such an approach. <p>

"There's no way these two rules can be the same," he said. "The PHS and FDA

rules are completely different rules, with completely different functions. <p>

"People are missing the point Ñ we want to know if investigators have an

interest in the study," Temple added, explaining that detailed disclosures are

considered essential by the agency. "If we perceive that a person has a

substantial financial interest in the outcome then I have no doubts that we'll

ask about the particular concerns." <p>

<h3>Outlook </h3><p>

Although Temple's intransigence may suggest continued support for the financial

disclosure proposal within the agency, industry experts say that the agency's

course on the disclosure rule ultimately may reflect heavy congressional

pressure for deregulation.<p>

In fact, the FDA background statement notes "considerable" congressional

attention to the issue and concedes that major drug and device firms do not

participate in payment schemes that would trigger the type of disclosures set

forth in the FDA proposed rule. <p>

Accordingly, some experts suggest that it is questionable that the agency will

proceed with such a controversial measure while broad FDA reform proposals are

still pending in Congress. At press time, no publication date for a final rule

on financial disclosures had been announced.

<Title> Proposal Would Add Performance Test Option to UL 58 Steel Tank Standard</Title>
</head>

<body background="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">
<IMG SRC = "/tpg/enviro/ustt/ustthead.gif" alt="Underground Storage Tank Guide"><P>


<h2> Proposal Would Add Performance Test Option to UL 58 Steel Tank
Standard</h2><P>

A proposal sent by Underwriters Laboratories (UL) May 30 to industry

representatives would change the method used to calculate the steel thickness

required by the organization's standard for underground storage tanks (USTs)

storing flammable and combustible liquids.<p>

In addition to incorporating the Roark equation for calculating steel thickness,

the proposed revisions to the 61-year-old UL 58, <i>Steel Underground Tanks for

Flammable and Combustible Liquids</i>, would add a performance test that would apply

to tank designs that do not fit the Roark equation.<p>

The proposal also invited comment on structural improvements in tank heads, head

joints, lift lugs and other areas. Many of these changes were proposed about a

year ago, but were never finalized.<p>

UL sent the bulletin soliciting comments on the proposal to its industry

advisory conference for UL 58; the industry advisory group for UL 1746, <i>External

Corrosion Protection Systems for Steel Underground Storage Tanks</i>; UL's fire and

casualty councils and subscribers to the UL 58 standard. Comments are due Sept.

3, and UL plans to finalize the revisions by the end of the year.<p>

In March, UL proposed revisions to UL 1746 that would incorporate the Roark

equation for calculating tank wall thickness and modify the current external

pressure test (see <i>Bulletin,</i> April 1996, p. 1). If the proposed revisions to

both standards are finalized, the revisions would make UL 58 similar to UL 1746

by eliminating the steel-gauge specifications table in favor of the Roark

equation and by adding the performance test. <p>

The revisions are a step toward the eventual merger of the two standards,

according to Jon Brannan, associate managing engineer with UL. UL expects the

demand for UL 58 steel tank designs that do not include external corrosion

protection to diminish in the next five to 10 years, making a separate standard

unnecessary, he said. Plain steel tanks would still be available as UL-listed

components under the combined standard if people wanted to purchase them and

apply their own external corrosion protection, he said.<p>

<h3>Reason for the Changes</h3><p>

The current UL 1746 allows the manufacture of tanks with walls of thinner steel

than those allowed under the current UL 58. These reduced wall thickness (RWT)

tanks "do not provide a sufficient factor of safety to withstand the external

pressure USTs experience during service, particularly with marginal quality

installations and with the use of poor backfill," according to the Steel Tank

Institute (STI). <p>

STI proposed that UL change the shell thickness specifications of both standards

because STI "became aware of [RWT] tanks which were alleged to have buckled in

service, or during integrity testing," according to an article in the STI

newsletter, <i>Tank Talk</i>. STI specifications do not allow RWT tanks, according to

STI's Lorri Grainawi.<p>

The revisions to UL 1746 were prompted by industry concerns, Brannan said, but

"there have been no UST failures as the result of a deficiency in the UL 1746

standard." In addition, adding a performance test to UL 58 will allow

opportunities for innovative tank designs, he said.<p>

<h3>The Roark Equation</h3><p>

Leslie Scott, president of Trusco Tank Inc., said the proposal is better than

the old fabrication standard because the Roark equation will take into account

the length, diameter and burial depth of each tank. Considering a tank's

configuration when determining structural requirements will make the degree of

safety more consistent among the various UL 58-listed tanks, he said. Because

the current UL 58 categorizes tanks by diameter, some shorter tanks were built

stronger than they needed to be, he said. Trusco manufactures tanks under both

UL 58 and UL 1746.<p>

Scott criticized the proposal for not specifying how the Roark equation should

be applied in certain situations, such as when a tank has stiffeners or

bulkheads. Although the proposal allows a 25 percent increase in tank length if

a stiffener is added at the tank's midpoint, it does not address the use of a

bulkhead at the midpoint or an off-center stiffener, Scott said. Wayne Geyer of

STI explained that the proposal addresses bulkheads by treating them as

stiffeners, despite differences in their impact on the structural strength 

of the tank.<p>

In addition, the proposal allows a 40 percent increase if two stiffeners are

added at one-third points in 

the tank, but there are many other configurations, Scott said. Trusco builds

multi-compartment tanks, he noted.<p>

The performance test was proposed, in part, to address potential design

variations that may not be covered by the equation, Brannan said.<p>

Sullivan D. Curran of the Fiberglass Tank and Pipe Institute also expressed

concerns about relying solely on the Roark equation as proposed. "While the

Roark equation may be used to compute the standard steel plate thickness for a

'simply supported plate,' it was not derived ... to be used to determine the

allowable thickness for a 'supported plate' of common construction materials,

including steel," Curran said.<p>

Geyer noted that STI sponsored extensive testing to verify the applicability of

the Roark equation before proposing that UL incorporate it into the

standards.<p>

Curran also noted that the proposal does not include references to support the

factors used by UL for Modulus of Elasticity of Steel and Poisson's Ratio. The

factors used in the proposal differ from those used in several designer

handbooks and other standards and would allow the use of thinner steel, he

said.<p>

Institute members support the steel tank industry's efforts to assist UL in

developing valid tank standards and maintaining the credibility of the UL label,

Curran said. Institute members manufacture "virtually all" of the UL-listed

fiberglass USTs, he added.<p>

<h3>The New Performance Test</h3><p>

The performance test in the UL 58 proposal is the same  test proposed for UL

1746, Brannan said. The external pressure test would require that the tank

withstand burial in at least five feet of water for one hour. The proposed test

is different from the test now used under UL 1746, in which the tank is

supported by backfill.<p>

STI believes that the proposed test is superior to the current version. It is

not good engineering practice to rely too heavily on backfill for the tank's

structural integrity because the type, compaction and moisture content of

backfill can vary substantially, STI said. Using water instead of backfill makes

the test more consistent and repeatable, Grainawi said.<p>

However, STI believes that standards should rely on engineering calculations

like the Roark equation when possible, reserving performance tests for cases

when the equations are not applicable. "It is far more important to base

requirements on engineering design calculations rather than on performance

tests," STI said. This philosophy is consistent with structural standards

developed by other organizations, STI noted.<p>

Curran favored a switch from a fabrication guideline to a performance standard,

but not the "either-or" approach that was proposed. Curran questioned the

rationale for changing the UL 1746 performance test, noting that the current

test has been used for 30 years in other UST standards. <p>

Improper installation and backfill should be addressed by environmental

regulations, code requirements and standard industry practices, Curran said.

However, Geyer noted that in actual practice, local code officials may lack the

training and resources to fully implement these requirements.<p>

<html> <title> Court applies Title VII to Student's Title IX claim</title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<P>
<h2> Court applies Title VII hostile environment theory to Student's Title IX
claim</h2>
<body>
<P>
<b><i>Does a school district have a duty to protect students from sexual
harassment by their peers?</i></b><P>

Although a school district does not have a constitutional duty to take
affirmative action to prevent sexual harassment by students, the U.S. District
Court for Western Missouri ruled that such a duty may arise under Title IX.<P>

Jennifer Bosley, a minor student in the Kearney R-1 School District, complained
that she was sexually harassed by other students while riding the school buses.
Specifically, she complained that while on the bus, students sang sexually
inappropriate songs, a boy hit her on her bottom, another boy rubbed himself and
took his shirt off and brushed up against some of the girls, a boy accused
Jennifer of being a homosexual, and another boy claimed that Jennifer was having
sex with a frog and that she had AIDS.<P>

After all of these incidents occurred, Jennifer's mother complained to the school
officials, including the superintendent, the assistant superintendent, the
principal of Jennifer's school, and the principal of Kearney Intermediate School.
After concluding that no satisfactory action had been taken by the school
district, Mrs. Bosley removed her children from the school district. <P>

Ultimately, Mrs. Bosley brought suit against the school district under 42 U.S.C.
1983 and 20 U.S.C. 1681. Specifically, it was alleged that the school district
(1) violated Jennifer's constitutional rights to privacy, substantive due
process, equal protection and other constitutional rights; (2) failed to fulfill
its duty to stop inappropriate sexual harassment and thereby intentionally
discriminated against Jennifer by causing her to be excluded from, and denying
her the benefits of, a federally funded educational program; (3) negligently
failed to protect students from sexual harassment; and (4) breached a duty
arising from the school/student relationship the district had with Jennifer --
specifically the duty to protect Jennifer and provide her a place of safety. In
counts five, six and seven, Mrs. Bosley alleged claims on behalf of herself for
loss of services and medical expenses, for loss of consortium, and for
slander.<P>

In rejecting most of these claims before trial, the court said that, except in
certain limited circumstances, "state and local governmental entities have no
duty under the substantive component of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment to protect the life, liberty and property of its citizens from private
actors." Circumstances where such a duty arises include situations where the
state takes a person into custody and holds her there against her will -- such as
where an individual has been incarcerated or involuntarily committed to a mental
hospital. In these situations, a state is constitutionally required to provide
adequate food, shelter, clothing, and medical care, and in addition, must provide
those in its custody reasonable safety from themselves and others, including
private actors.<P>

The court found that the case at hand was not comparable to the above situations.
Here, Jennifer Bosley was not taken into custody by the school district and held
against her will. Rather, she was simply a student enrolled in the district's
schools, the court said. The fact that her mother removed her from the school
district indicates that she could have done this at an earlier time and "was not
wholly dependent on the school district to protect her daughter," the court
added. <P>

Thus, the court concluded that Bosley's assertion of a substantive due process
violation under &#167;1983 must fail as a matter of law because "compulsory
school attendance does not create the custodial relationship necessary to impose
constitutional liability on the defendant school district for failing to protect
Jennifer Bosley against alleged sexual harassment by her fellow students."
Further, the court said that it could not conclude that the school district
treated Bosley differently from the male students in the same or similar
circumstances, thus, it said her equal protection claims under &#167;1983 must
fail as well.<P>

The court further concluded that sovereign immunity barred Bosley's claims of
negligence and breach of a duty owed to her by the school district by reason of a
special relationship between schools and their students. Because the underlying
claim cannot survive summary judgment for the school district, Mrs. Bosley can
have no derivative claim for loss of services and medical expenses, the court
said. Under Missouri law, Mrs. Bosley cannot recover for loss of consortium.
Finally, the court dismissed Mrs. Bosley's claim of slander for failure to plead
the facts of her claim with particularity. <P>

<h3>Hostile environment under Title IX</h3><P>

However, with respect to the allegations brought under Title IX, the court denied
the school district's motion for summary judgment and allowed Bosley's claim to
go forward. Relying on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <i>Franklin v. Gwinnett
County Public Schools</i>, 503 U.S. 60 (1992), the court said that Title VII law
provides standards for enforcing the anti-discrimination provisions of Title IX.
Further, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's guidelines instruct
agencies to consider Title VII standards when determining whether an employer has
violated Title IX, the court said. Finally, the Office for Civil Rights uses
Title VII's hostile environment standard when determining whether an educational
institution has failed to take proper remedial action when dealing with
student-to-student sexual harassment.<P>

Thus, the court found that Title VII principles should be used to determine
whether there was intentional discrimination under Title IX. Hostile environment
sexual harassment is actionable when it is sufficiently patterned and pervasive,
the court said. Quoting from <i>Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</i>., 114 S.Ct. 367
(1993), the court said that in making this determination, the adjudicator must
consider "the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it
is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and
whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance." <P>

To impute conduct to an employer where the claim involves harassment by peers, it
must be established that the employer knew or should have known of the hostile
environment and took insufficient remedial action, the court added.<P>

Thus, to establish a claim against a school district in cases of
student-to-student harassment, it must be shown that "(1) the plaintiff was
subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment; (2) the harassment was based on sex;
(3) the harassment occurred during the plaintiff's participation in an
educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance; and (4)
the school district knew of the harassment and intentionally failed to take
proper remedial action."<P>

"Once a school district becomes aware of sexual harassment, it must promptly take
remedial action which is reasonably calculated to end the harassment," the court
concluded. The court found that based on the allegations presented by Bosley,
there were genuine issues for trial. Further, the court concluded that the school
district had ample notice of its potential liability for damages when it failed
to take adequate remedial actions to prevent the continued harassment of Bosley.

1995)

<H2>What MCOs Need to Know About Medicare</H2>

<H3>EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: PART ONE OF TWO</H3>
Not only is the marketing of a Medicare risk contract difficult because
of the scrutiny with which the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)
examines a managed care organization's material, but often MCOs may not
understand the unique needs and characteristics of senior consumers.<BR>
<BR>
Today's senior is a financially savvy, sophisticated consumer who sees himself
or herself as an active player, not as someone on the sidelines in a rocking
chair, according to one marketing expert. <BR>
<BR>
In Part I of this exclusive interview, Thomas Hayes, senior vice president
and director of marketing services for The Senior Network, Inc., based in
Stamford, CT, offers managed care organizations (MCOs) insights into the
unique characteristics of marketing risk contracts to seniors, specific
considerations in marketing to senior women, the effect of the baby boom
population on marketing risk contracts, and strategies on working with HCFA.<BR>
<HR><B><I>Bulletin: </I></B>What are some of the unique characteristics
of marketing a Medicare managed care plan?<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Hayes:</I></B> Compared with marketing other products, one of the
most unique characteristics of marketing managed care is that many seniors
have a strong bias against the product itself. This makes marketing an uphill
battle because the product already starts with a strike against it.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, unlike most products and services, such as a detergent or soap,
the physical connection between an MCO and the senior is tenuous. After
enrollment, a senior may never interact with the MCO for extended periods
of time. This lack of contact also places an added burden on the marketing
material (and telemarketers) because the material must forge a link between
the MCO and the senior. <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Bulletin: </I></B>Demographically, a significant percentage of Medicare
beneficiaries are women. How would you characterize today's senior woman?<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Hayes:</I></B> Today's senior woman, between the ages of 65 and 74,
is an extremely sophisticated consumer. She also is financially savvy, but
what I believe distinguishes her most is that she is, at this stage in her
life, able to turn her attention toward herself. To illustrate what I mean,
in one survey we did, senior women said that they were now able to take
a bath instead of a shower. It is not that the senior woman wants to see
herself as rocking her life away in a chair, but that, having done for others,
it is now all right to do for herself. <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Bulletin: </I></B>What can a marketing piece do to reach this segment
of the population?<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Hayes:</I></B> To reach senior women, I believe it is necessary to
portray them as busy. I think it is a mistake to show a senior sitting down
and reading a book because that is not how they see themselves. It's not
necessary to show them mountain biking or hang gliding, but it is crucial
to show them doing something - jogging, taking a hike with their grandkids
- an activity that shows them physically able to participate in life.<BR>
<BR>
Interestingly, we have found that men often are an easier sell for managed
care products. As a group, men show less identification with a particular
physician, and are more willing to try something new if it will reduce their
medical expenses.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Bulletin: </I></B>Do you foresee major changes in the &quot;average&quot;
Medicare beneficiary as more baby boomers become eligible for benefits?
What will these changes entail in terms of marketing?<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Hayes: </I></B>I believe that attention focused on the baby boomers
as an attitude rather than a demographic segment is overblown, especially
by the media and in advertising. <BR>
<BR>
There are substantial differences, for example, between a person born in
1946 at the start of the boom, and one born in 1964, at the boom's end.
Certainly, I see members of the baby boom generation, as they become eligible
for Medicare, exerting force on the market, but it is a force through numbers,
rather than through attitude. More importantly, I think it is important
to understand that their entrance into Medicare is still 15 to 20 years
away, and that the current population of seniors has needs that must be
addressed, especially if an MCO wants to be in existence in the year 2013.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Bulletin: </I></B>What are the three most important things that HCFA
looks for in examining marketing material? <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Hayes: </I></B>The three crucial things we have found to be true in
working with HCFA on marketing material are: 
<UL>
<LI>a recognition of the firm rules that HCFA has issued, for instance regarding
lock-in provisions; 
<LI>clarity of communication, that is, a senior should have no difficulty
at all understanding the rules laid out in the marketing material; and 
<LI>tonality, which means that the material should balance communication
and interest in making the plan's design understandable and being a sales
tool. 
</UL>
One thing that we have found in working with HCFA is that there is a variance
across the country, not only in terms of process, for instance in approval
of marketing material, but even in terms of actual wordings at times, with
certain phrases being unquestioned in some parts of the country, while in
others the same phrasings have caused difficulty. <BR>
<BR>
A related development that we are seeing more recently is in state insurance
commissions wanting to see marketing material and becoming involved in the
approval process with regard to marketing material. I foresee these commissions
as becoming more and more involved in the marketing process as managed care
becomes more prevalent, and this will add another regulatory hurdle that
an MCO must overcome to market its plans. n<BR>
<BR>
Part II of the interview will focus on the role of telemarketing in offering
a risk contract, what to look for in choosing an outside marketing firm,
and how to maximize the relationship between an MCO and a marketing firm.
Part II will appear in next month's <I>Bulletin</I>. <BR>

Major Implications for RCRA Corrective Action in EPA Policy Statement</TITLE>

<H2>Major Implications for RCRA Corrective Action in EPA Policy Statement</h2>
<BODY>

<P>
<I>By David P. Flynn, Esq.<BR>
Phillips, Lytle, Hitchcock, Blaine &amp; Huber</I><P>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently 
issued a &quot;policy statement&quot; in the <I>Federal 
Register</I> (60 F.R. 53, (3/20/95)) that has major implications 
for the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) 
corrective action program and for facilities subject 
to both Superfund and RCRA jurisdiction.<P>

Historically, it has not been clear which program, the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and 
Liability Act (CERCLA, or &quot;Superfund&quot;) or 
RCRA (or a mixture of both) would be relevant to the 
investigation and remediation of a site that met the 
criteria for both programs.  With this &quot;policy 
statement,&quot; EPA has indicated that in such a set 
of circumstances, the RCRA program can take the lead 
in framing the investigative and remediation requirements 
for such sites.<P>

EPA states in the policy statement that it is agency 
policy to delete RCRA facilities from the National 
Priorities List before an ongoing cleanup is complete 
if the site will be &quot;adequately addressed&quot; 
in the RCRA corrective action program under an existing 
RCRA permit or RCRA order.  In addition, the agency 
will &quot;defer&quot; from listing a site on the National 
Priorities List (NPL) if there is a mechanism in place 
to ensure that the investigative and remedial needs 
will be addressed under the RCRA corrective action 
program.<P>

The agency has identified several reasons for this policy. 
First, EPA states that this deletion/deferral policy 
will &quot;free CERCLA's oversight resources for use 
in situations where another authority is not available.&quot; 
This justification may evidence EPA's desire to speed 
up the Superfund remediation process as well as reduce 
the number of sites on the NPL by moving sites into 
the RCRA program, which would also would allow a number 
of sites to be delegated to those states that have 
authorized corrective action programs.<P>

Another reason stated for the deletion/deferral policy 
is to &quot;avoid possible duplication of effort and 
the need for an owner/operator to follow more than 
one set of regulatory procedures.&quot;  From this 
stated justification it appears that this policy has 
been driven, at least in part, by programmatic differences 
and conflicts within the agency at sites that can be 
considered both a CERCLA and RCRA site.  In the past, 
at least, the agency has not been troubled by the burden 
of duplication of effort on the regulated community.<P>

EPA has enumerated several factors or criteria that 
must be considered in a situation where a site is being 
considered for &quot;deletion&quot; from the NPL, and 
the remedial program being deferred to the RCRA program. 
If there is &quot;uncertainty&quot; as to whether 
the criteria have been met, deletion of an NPL site 
generally will be inappropriate.  The deletion factors 
set out in the policy statement include:<P>

<OL>
<LI>If evaluated under EPA's current policy, the site 
would be eligible for a deferral (<I>i.e.</I> would not be 
included on the NPL list);<BR>

<LI>The site is currently being addressed by RCRA corrective 
action authorities under an existing enforceable order 
or permit that contains corrective action requirements;<BR>

<LI>Response under RCRA is progressing adequately; and 
<BR>

<LI>Deletion would not disrupt an ongoing CERCLA response 
action.<P>
</OL>
There are several scenarios where the ability to delete 
or defer a site from NPL listing, and proceeding under 
the RCRA program, may be beneficial to a facility owner/operator.<P>

First, to the extent that portions of a site would be 
considered discrete solid waste management units or 
corrective action management units <I>and</I> such areas are 
not currently accessible due to current operations, 
the investigation and remediation of those areas under 
the RCRA corrective action program may be deferred 
until such time as active use ceases or the areas otherwise 
become &quot;accessible.&quot;<P>

Second, the goals and objectives of the remedial program 
could be more advantageous to a facility owner or operator 
under the RCRA corrective action program.  Oftentimes, 
the RCRA program will look at the facility boundary 
as the &quot;point of compliance&quot; for exposure 
purposes at an active facility, and determine cleanup 
objectives on that basis. Conversely, the CERCLA program 
often requires that a remedy meet stringent cleanup 
requirements at an<I>y point</I> at or beneath the site.  
This difference could have a multi-million dollar impact 
on the cost of the investigation and remedial program 
for a facility.<p>

There are costs and benefits to this EPA policy.  A 
facility owner affected by this policy will have to 
evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, whether it makes 
sense to seek deletion of an existing NPL site or attempt 
to defer the listing of other sites, and proceed under 
the RCRA corrective action program.<P>

<H2>Appeals Court: Zero Discharge Not Applicable When Permit Is Unavailable</H2>

<body>
A federal appeals court on April 1 reversed a lower court order that permanently

barred a Georgia real estate developer from discharging stormwater runoff from a

19-acre residential housing development.<p>

The appeals court held that the zero discharge standard for stormwater runoff

does not apply when "compliance with the standard is factually impossible"

(<i>Hughey v. JMS Development Corp.</i>, 94-8402, 94-88655 (11th Cir.)).<p>

The Clean Water Act (CWA) specifically prohibits the discharge of pollutants

without a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.

However, "this zero discharge standard presupposes the availability of an NPDES

permit, allowing for the discharge of pollutants under the conditions set forth

in the permit," the court said. <p>

The court also found that the zero discharge standard does not apply when the

discharger was in good-faith compliance with local pollution control

requirements that substantially mirrored the proposed NPDES discharge standards,

and the discharges were minimal. "The law does not compel the doing of

impossibilities," the court said.<p>

In August 1992, homeowner Terence Hughey sued JMS Development Corp. under the

citizen suit provision of CWA, alleging that JMS had violated the act by

discharging stormwater from a point source without first obtaining a permit.

Hughey alleged that JMS' activities caused two watercourses to become muddied

during rainfall events: a small stream originating on JMS property, and the

Yellow River into which the stream empties. Hughey owns land abutting the Yellow

River. <p>

Hughey alleged that JMS' discharges were made "in association with industrial

activity," which includes construction, according to U.S. Environmental

Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. Because the developer's clearing, grading

and grubbing activities were considered "industrial," Hughey contended that JMS

was required to have an NPDES permit. In the absence of a permit, Hughey argued,

JMS was subject to the zero discharge standard. <p>

The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in August 1992

issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting JMS from discharging stormwater

without a permit from its Gwinnett County, Ga., development property, and in

November of that year the court found that JMS was potentially liable under CWA

for its stormwater discharges. <p>

JMS conceded that rain water had run off its property and that it did not

possess an NPDES permit. However, the company was able to show that no such

permit was available from either EPA or Georgia at the time the property was

under development and that it had obtained every permit that was available prior

to initiating construction. EPA finalized its stormwater general permits in

September 1992, but Georgia did not issue its industrial and construction

general permits until June 1993 and July 1995, respectively. <p>

In addition, JMS had spent over $30,000 installing sedimentation control

devices, including silt fences, check dams, vegetation, sloping and a

sedimentation retention basin, at the request of Gwinnett County officials. The

erosion and sedimentation control measures used by JMS met or exceeded the

county's requirements. <p>

Nevertheless, in December 1993, the court found that JMS had indeed discharged

stormwater without a permit on 14 separate dates in 1992, and that the

violationsÑalthough minimalÑwere ongoing. The court subsequently issued a

permanent order prohibiting JMS from discharging stormwater without a permit and

required JMS to pay $8,500 in civil penalties and over $115,000 in attorney fees

to Hughey.<p>

In appealing the ruling, JMS argued that the general ban on discharging

stormwater, which in effect was an order to "obey the law," violated the

standard of specificity required by rules of civil procedure. JMS also contended

that it should not be punished for failing to secure a permit when no permit was

available, and objected to the award of attorney fees and costs.<p>

The appeals court found that once JMS began the development, compliance with the

zero discharge standard became impossible. "This was not a case of a

manufacturing facility that could abate the discharge of pollutants by ceasing

operations," the appeals court said. "Nor did the discharger come to court with

unclean hands: JMS made every good-faith effort to comply with CWA and all other

relevant pollution control standards." <p>

"Practically speaking, rain water will run downhill, and not even a law passed

by the Congress of the United States can stop that," the court said.<p>

<html> <title> Student's Sexual Harassment Claims Dismissed As Untimely </title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/person/sink/sinkhead.gif" alt="Educator's Guide to Controlling Sexual Harassment">
<P>
<h2> Student's Sexual Harassment Claims Dismissed As Untimely </h2>
<body>

A student seeking monetary damages from a school district after claiming she was
sexually harassed by a temporary school employee failed to file her complaint on
time, Louisiana's 4th Circuit Court of Appeal ruled recently. The appellate
ruling affirms a decision by a district court dismissing the complaint.<P>

The action was brought by Vertis Bowers on behalf of her daughter Krishell, an
elementary school student. The claim stemmed from an incident that took place on
Nov. 6, 1991, in which a group of several students, including Krishell, reported
to their principal that their substitute teacher, Alvin Pierre, had "touched them
inappropriately, namely, fondled their breasts," according to the court.<P>

After learning of the alleged incident, the school principal contacted the police
department, and the teacher was arrested for "sexual misconduct." The principal
testified that the teacher did not return to work after his arrest.<P>

On the date of the incident, a detective was called to the school to investigate
the alleged sexual misconduct. At that time, the detective took Krishell's
statement and gave her a copy of his business card. The next day, he spoke to
Krishell's mother, he said, to discuss her daughter's statement to him regarding
the alleged misconduct.<P>

Bowers filed her sexual harassment complaint against the school district on Jan.
6, 1993, more than a year after the alleged incident took place. She sought
recovery in the form of damages from the school under Article 2315 of the
Louisiana Civil Code, a statute which provides that when an individual is harmed,
the responsible party is liable for reparations.<P>

<h3>Knowledge of the Abuse</h3>

On Oct. 19, 1994, the school district filed a motion asserting that due to
Bowers' long silence on the issue (during which time she did not urge her claim),
her claim was not valid. In response, Bowers submitted an amended petition
defending her failure to submit the claim more quickly. A Louisiana district
court granted the school's motion, and Bowers appealed.<P>

According to Bowers' amended petition, the teacher had threatened the students he
molested and told them not to tell anyone of his improper actions. This fact, the
petition said, "combined with the traumatic results of the molestation, prevented
Krishell from talking about [the incident] with her mother."<P>

The court learned that through communication with both the detective and the
school principal, Bowers had been informed in 1991 that Pierre had sexually
abused students at the school, including her daughter. In her petition, however,
Bowers claimed she did not learn "in any substantial way" of the <i>extent</i> of
the abuse or the "forms of the abuse" until the summer of 1992. In fact, she said
that until that time, she had known only that "some sexual violation(s) had
occurred."<P>

The plaintiff also argued that Krishell had never shared with her mother all the
details of the misconduct, a fact that Bowers attributed to the "psychological
and emotional damage [the child] suffered." Krishell "could not and did not
convey" the facts of the abuse to her mother, the petition said. Bowers said that
she got some information from her daughter about a year after the incident.<P>

The court heard testimony indicating that during the period of more than a year
between the alleged abuse of her daughter and the filing of her complaint, Bowers
did not take any action to withdraw her daughter from the school.<P>

<h3>The Court's Reasoning</h3>

Bowers maintained that the district court, in dismissing her petition, had failed
to apply the doctrine of <i>contra non valentem,</i> which holds that a legal
action cannot be time-barred if an individual is <i>unable</i> to bring the
action. The plaintiff also maintained that in cases of child molestation, the
deadline for filing a claim is "suspended until the child victim's parents learn
of the abuse, the extent of the abuse and the various forms of the abuse."<P>

The appellate court countered that the district court <i>had</i> applied the
doctrine of <i>contra non valentem,</i> and that the deadline for filing the
claim had been properly considered. Bowers admitted that on Nov. 6, she had known
that her daughter had been molested and that the molestation included "fondling
of the breast," the court said. The fact that she failed to find out any further
details was "her own fault."<P>

The court found that to learn more about the abuse, Bowers could have brought her
daughter to counseling, obtained a copy of the police report on the incident, or
actually gone to the school to discuss it with the principal. (Bowers claimed
that she had tried unsuccessfully to contact the principal by leaving phone
messages for her.)<P>

If Bowers felt unable to do these things, the court said, she could have "at the
very least immediately consulted a lawyer." Citing a precedent case, the court
said that a plaintiff is "deemed to know that which he could have learned from
reasonable diligence."<P>

According to the court, <i>contra non valentem</i> only suspends a deadline for
filing a claim until a plaintiff has a "reasonable basis to pursue a claim." In
this case, this basis for action existed as of Nov. 6, 1991, the court
concluded.<P>

Because the complaint was not filed on time, the appeals court affirmed the
district court's decision to dismiss the claim. (<i>Bowers v. Orleans Parish
School Board,</i> La. Ct. App., 4th Cir., No. 95-CA-2530, May 29, 1996)

in favor of 25 research hospitals in the U.S. District Court for the District of

California, Western Division (<i>Cedars Sinai Medical Center, et al. v. Donna

Shalala, No. CV-95-2902)</i>.<p>

The April 8 court ruling is considered a pivotal victory for the hospitals,

which faced potential investigations and prosecutorial action by the Inspector

General (IG) of the Department of Health and Human Services for having accepted

reimbursement for investigational devices between 1986 and 1994.<p>

At issue in the case is Health Care Finance Administration's (HCFA's)

retroactive enforcement of an informal 1986 Medicare Manual Instruction, which

originally was issued without notice-and-comment rulemaking, as required by the

Administrative Procedures Act (APA). <p>

Although HCFA continued to reimburse hospitals for investigational devices for

several years despite the 1986 instruction, the agency began to halt the

payments and seek remuneration from some hospitals after formalizing the policy

in August of 1994. However, by then the IG already had subpoenaed 132 research

hospitals, including the 25 plaintiff hospitals.<p>

<h3>HCFA Confusion</h3><p>

According to one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, Robert A. Klein, the 25 hospitals

were concerned that if left unchallenged, the IG would attempt to retroactively

disallow the Medicare charges, and even seek penalties under alleged deviations

from Medicare fraud and abuse rules. <p>

Klein also told the <i>Monthly Bulletin </i>that he believed his client had

cause for concern, in light of HCFA's history in prior cases of retroactively

penalizing hospitals for reimbursement issues that arose from confusing or

improperly implemented policies. <p>

An April 12 release by the American Association of Medical Colleges states that

a number of institutions ceased device clinical trials as a result of the 1994

IG investigation. More recently, in 1996, HCFA's Seattle Regional Office

requested additional documentation and began reviewing the subpoenaed records of

nine hospitals, which was expected to result in recoupment of payments for

alleged overpayments relating to the IDEs.<p>

<h3>1986 Instruction</h3><p>

The HCFA policy at issue is contained in a 1986 Medicare Manual Instruction

which states that unapproved devices are "considered investigational" by

Medicare and are not "reasonable and necessary" for the diagnosis or treatment

of disease.<p>

Prior to 1986, intermediaries determined reimbursement on a case-by-case basis,

in order to determine whether or not a treatment was "reasonable and necessary."

This practice continued despite the 1986 instruction, until HCFA issued a "blue

book" memorandum in August 1994, reiterating the 1986 policy.<p>

Subsequently, in 1995, HCFA issued a formal rule partially reversing this policy

and allowing reimbursement for "non-experimental" IDE devices (see "Medicare to

Cover Certain IDE Devices," November 1995, p. 6).<p>

However, research hospitals that received reimbursements for investigational

devices during the time period at issue -- from 1986 through 1994 -- could be

held responsible for returning these funds and even assessed penalties if HCFA

were allowed to treat the 1986 instruction as a binding regulation.<p>

<h3>Procedural Victory</h3><p>

Although the government contended in its defense that the 1986 instruction was

merely interpretive of the Medicare statute (42 U.S.C. &#167;1395hh(a)(2)), the

plaintiff hospitals argued successfully that the instruction was a substantive

rule subject to full rulemaking procedures under the APA. <p>

Because HCFA did not follow APA rulemaking procedures, the court ruled that

Medicare Hospital Manual section 260.1, Medicare Intermediary Manual section

3151.1 and Medicare Carriers Manual section 2303.1 are invalid. Although the

decision pertains only to the 25 plaintiff hospitals, it could serve as an

important precedent for research hospitals that obtained Medicare reimbursement

for treatments involving IDEs from 1986 through 1994.<p>

Sources familiar with the case said that a government appeal of the decision may

be likely, but at press time, no such appeal had been announced.<p>

<H2>Draft California Permit Takes a 'Common Sense' Approach</H2>

<body><p>

The California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) has extended until

Dec. 1 the deadline for members of industrial monitoring groups to submit group

monitoring plans. Sampling and monitoring requirements for all industrial

stormwater permittees also are postponed until Dec. 1.<p>

In addition, the board is circulating a new draft of the state's next industrial

general permit. The revised draft differs significantly from the original

permit, which expired Nov. 17.<p>

SWRCB had announced in July that deadlines for monitoring groups were postponed

until further notice, while regulators continued to work out details of the new

permit. But in late September, SWRCB Executive Director Walt Petit directed

groups to submit monitoring plans by Oct. 15. The abrupt change of plans and

short notice period sparked an angry response from industry, which in turn

resulted in an additional grace period, according to attorney William Funderburk

Jr., with the Los Angeles law firm of Radcliff, Frandsen, Tricker and Dongell. 

<p>

Funderburk said he is "encouraged by" provisions of the revised draft permit

that appear to recognize the variable quality of stormwater runoff. "There are a

lot of problems that our clients have with the draft permit, but we are

generally encouraged."<p>

Funderburk likened runoff from stormwater to fugitive air emissions. Unlike

regulations for stationary air sources and process wastewater discharges that

are measurable and reliable, stormwater discharges are highly unpredictable. 

<p>

"We need to come up with creative ways to regulate these fugitive or mobile

sources," Funderburk said. For example, requirements for best available

technology economically achievable (BAT) and best conventional pollutant control

technology (BCT) should give maximum flexibility to individual facilities to

design their own standards. BAT/BCT standards should not be in the hands of

regulators, and more importantly, they should not be designed by citizen groups,

he said. <p>

According to SWRCB, the draft permit is an attempt to address a variety of

concerns raised by monitoring group leaders, regional water board stormwater

staff and others. Requirements for receiving water limitations, stormwater

pollution prevention plans (SWP3s), monitoring, and group monitoring would

change, if the draft permit is adopted.  <p>

For example, under the draft permit, if a discharger failed to reduce a

pollutant that causes a violation of a water quality standard--despite having

implemented all best management practices (BMPs) that are technically and

economically achievable--the discharge of that pollutant would be considered in

compliance with receiving water limitations, provided the discharger obtains

approval from the water board. Under the old permit, dischargers that violated

receiving water limits, despite having fully implemented BMPs, could be found in

violation of the permit. <p>

"The loosely defined terms of the permit cut both ways," Funderburk said. "For

companies that read it closely they can conceivably get by on spending minimum

amounts to comply," he said. But there's a fine line between minimum compliance

and knowing how the permit will be enforced by various third parties, he said.

"So there's a minimum standard and a practical standard. We would prefer that

the practical standard be more refined and allow individual facilities greater

flexibility to define BAT/BCT for their own circumstances," he said.<p>

According to information provided by SWRCB, the old permit did not provide

enough detail about the major components of the SWP3. Furthermore, the old SWP3

requirements were inconsistent with EPA's new multi-sector permit. In the draft

permit, SWP3 requirements are revised to be more descriptive and explanatory,

and have been renumbered to more closely follow those in the federal

multi-sector permit, SWRCB said. The draft permit also would require an annual

compliance audit as part of the SWP3, it said. <p>

Monitoring requirements also would change under the draft permit. For example,

dischargers who comply with the general permit and have analyzed six samples

would be eligible for reduced sampling and analysis. Under the old permit,

dischargers were required to perform sampling and analysis twice a year,

regardless of the results. The draft permit also would extend the duration of

the rainy season, as defined in the permit, by two months; allow sampling in the

first hour of a storm, rather than the first half-hour; and remove the

definition of "significant storm," so that facilities could sample any storm

that produces a discharge.<p>

The draft permit also would recognize watershed monitoring as a viable

alternative to monitoring at an individual facility. Watershed monitoring would

have to be approved by the regional water board.<p>

Requirements for members of monitoring groups also would change. Under the draft

permit, two samples from all participating facilities in a given group would be

required over the life of the five-year general permit. The old permit required

two samples per year from the same 20 percent of participating facilities. The

draft permit also would require late filers to sample four times during the life

of the permit. Previously, late filers who joined groups were subject to the

same reduced sampling as other group members. <p>

"In terms of trends for the whole country, it's significant that California's

leading water agency essentially appears to be headed in a somewhat more common

sense regulatory direction," Funderburk said. "It's not deregulatory, but it

doesn't regulate through a buckshot, one-size-fits-all approach," he said. <p>

A public hearing on the permit was scheduled for Nov. 12. The permit can be

downloaded from the Internet at http://www.swrcb.ca.gov.

<html> <title>FDA Cites High Foreign Clinical Violations</title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/food/clin/clinhead.gif" alt="Guide to Good Clinical Practice">
<P>
<h2>FDA Cites High Foreign Clinical Violations</h2>
<body>
Drug sponsors and clinical investigators need to verify compliance with FDA
regulatory requirements when clinical studies originally conducted for European
registration are subsequently used in support of U.S. new drug approval (NDA)
submissions, according to FDA officials. <p>

Overall, the FDA reports that foreign studies have nearly twice the violation
rate of U.S. studies for basic FDA requirements such as protocol adherence and
adequate record keeping (see chart, below). In large part, this violation rate is
associated with studies originally conducted outside of an investigational new
drug (IND) application that are subsequently submitted by sponsors.<p>

<center><img src="/tpg/food/clin/clinjuly2a.gif"></center><P>

"The overwhelming majority of these studies were conceived for submission for
foreign drug registration, not U.S. registration," said Alan Lisook, M.D.,
clinical investigations branch chief within the Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research (CDER), in prepared remarks for a recent industry seminar held in
Israel. "It was only <i>post-facto</i> that they were submitted to the FDA.<p>

"Studies not performed under IND, in order to be accepted in support of NDA
claims, must meet the ethical requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki, or
the laws of the country in which the research was conducted, whichever
represents the greater protection of the individual," Lisook said.<p>

<h3>FDA Requirements</h3><p>

In providing an overview of FDA's policy with respect to foreign studies, Lisook
said current agency regulations allow the FDA to accept foreign studies as the
principal "adequate and well-controlled" studies used for U.S. marketing
approval, but only if they are applicable to the U.S. population and medical
practice and were performed by medically competent investigators. <p>
Although the regulations do not necessarily require on-site inspections, FDA's
current policy is to audit all foreign studies providing the basis for drug
approval if no such domestic studies also exist. This policy also is applied to
studies supporting "major" drug supplements. In addition, the FDA will launch
"investigator-oriented" inspections when it finds specific circumstances that
warrant further investigation (see "Leading Issues That Prompt FDA Investigator
Inspections," below).<p>

<h3>Different Requirements</h3><p>

During its foreign inspections, the FDA will consider whether or not a study
meets its minimum threshold for compliance, through meeting the requirements of
the country in which it is conducted or the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki. During this process, Lisook said that the FDA looks foremost for
review and approval (even if done orally), of a protocol by an appropriate
review committee, and use of informed consent.<p>

Lisook reported that the "major thrust" of the agency's audits in such
situations is to examine the validity of data submitted. He said three related
circumstances or violative conditions commonly are found that lead to a
recommendation that studies be rejected:<p>

<ol><li><i>Nonavailability of data for audit.</i> Typically, this problem becomes apparent
before an inspection is launched but after the sponsor is requested to schedule
an inspection.<p>

<li><i>Failure to follow protocol.</i> Examples of this type of violation, which is
relevant to all studies submitted to the FDA, include misreporting of drug
therapy and/or drug dosage or of disease remission; enrollment of ineligible
subjects; or inadequate blinding.<p>

<li><i>Unreported concomitant therapies.</i> The FDA requires that any administration
of concomitant therapy that might interfere with a study drug be reported as
such. Lisook said this problem is "particularly prevalent" in countries where
"polypharmacy" is common practice.</ol><p>

Other common violations cited by Lisook that are considered serious, but will
not necessarily warrant rejection of a study, include: consent form
deficiencies; inadequate drug accountability; failure to obtain institutional
review board (IRB) approvals; and failure to list subinvestigators in a study
(see "Drug Clinical Site Inspection Increase During Fiscal Year 1995," April
1995, p. 1).<p>

<h3>FDA Recourse</h3><p>

Lisook said that most clinical investigators are sent one of three types of
letters following an inspection of their clinical site. The bulk of letters sent
by the FDA (71 percent) are called "information letters," which identify
deviations from FDA clinical trial regulations, but without requiring a written
response. A second type of letter simply acknowledges that an inspection has
occurred, without alleging any deviations. These are used in 20 percent of
inspections.<p>

The third type of letter -- the FDA Warning Letter -- is used to address
deviations of "significant importance" that require prompt action by clinical
investigators. Although controversial, Warning Letters have been used for
alleged violations by foreign clinical investigators whose studies were used to
support an NDA (see "Warning Letter Sparks Controversy Over FDA Jurisdiction,"
September 1995, p. 1). Lisook said that Warning Letters are sent to
approximately 9 percent of clinical sites (see Tab 1100).<p>

<h3>FDA Sanctions</h3><p>

In the cases in which serious deviations are alleged, the FDA also can pursue a
range of sanctions against investigators, including disqualifications,
restrictions on receiving investigational drugs and even criminal prosecutions.
To date, the FDA has pursued such actions against 115 clinical investigators.
<p>

Although the more extreme clinical sanctions typically involve situations in
which willful deception of the agency occurred on the part of an investigator,
investigators are held accountable for data integrity, generally, and should
implement appropriate systems.<p>

Many of the inadvertent issues involving data integrity can be either averted or
minimized through routine quality control audits of foreign clinical sites,
Lisook said.<p>

<hr>
<h4><center>Leading Issues That Prompt FDA Investigator Inspections</h4></center><p>

<font size=-1>Described below are the leading reasons or observations for which FDA
bioresearch inspectors launch "investigator-oriented" inspections of clinical
sites, according to Alan Lisook, M.D., chief of the clinical investigations
branch, within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. These types of
inspections formerly were called "for-cause" inspections, and comprise roughly
10 percent of FDA clinical inspections. <p>

<ul><li><b>Large Volume of Work:</b> Researchers appear to have undertaken a "large number"
of investigational drug studies, or studies spanning very different areas of
medicine;<p>

<li><b>Research Out of Specialty:</b> Investigators doing research out of his/her
specialty area;<p>

<li><b>Aberrant Efficacy or Safety:</b> Researchers report efficacy or safety data that
appear to be "too good to be true" as compared to the findings of other
physician researchers;<p>

<li><b>Unrealistic Enrollment:</b> Researchers appear to have too many patients enrolled
than could be reasonably expected for the given disease and location in which
the study is occurring;<p>

<li><b>Overconsistent Lab Results:</b> Researchers report laboratory results consistent
beyond normal biologic variation or that are inconsistent with results submitted
by other investigators;<p>

<li><b>Media Attention:</b> Studies that have attracted significant media attention that
is anticipated to result in high demand for the subject drug;<p>

<li><b>Scientific Merit:</b> A study considered truly important such that it merits
in-depth examination;<p>

<li><b>Sponsor Complaints:</b> Sponsor representatives report to the FDA that they have
difficulty in obtaining case report forms or other problems relating to the
trial; and<p>

<li><b>Subject Complaints:</b> The FDA receives a complaint from a study subject about
alleged violations of subject rights or the study protocol.</ul></font><p>

<h2>Courts, agencies and 105th Congress to reshape rights of people with
disabilities</h2>

The 105th Congress, which convenes Jan. 7, may not be the main branch of
government redefining the ADA during 1997. Instead, the courts and federal
agencies may play a much larger role in helping to define this law further. <P>

While the courts and agencies influence the development of ADA law, Congress may
focus its attention on the reauthorization of two other significant laws
prohibiting discrimination based on disability: the Rehabilitation Act and
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). <P>

Nevertheless, some business lobbyists and disability advocates anticipate that
there might be proposals to amend the ADA. <P>

<H3>Supreme Court</H3>

Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet heard any ADA case, at least three
decisions it will issue this year may have a significant impact on disability
rights.<P>

Stephen Gold and Diane Coleman, attorneys for Not Dead Yet, and American Disabled
for Attendant Programs Today, have filed a brief in <I>Vacco v. Quill</I>, C.A. No.
95-1858, a right-to-assisted-suicide case that the Supreme Court has agreed to
hear.<P>

In their brief, Gold and Coleman asserted that if the Court were to uphold a
constitutional right to assisted suicide or authorize its legalization by states,
it would be sanctioning "a lethal form of discrimination which violates the ADA."
Gold and Coleman maintained that people with severe disabilities, including
nonterminal disabilities, are potential victims of a right to assisted
suicide.<P>

The Court will consider whether to affirm the judgment of the 2nd U.S. Circuit
for the Court of Appeals, which held that there is a constitutional right to
assisted suicide under the Equal Protection Clause. <P>

"With respect to the protection of minorities, the poor and the nonmentally
handicapped, it suffices to say that these classes of persons are entitled to
treatment equal to that afforded to all those who now may hasten death by means
of life-support withdrawal," the 2nd Circuit said.<P>

The Court also will decide two title VII cases that may also affect ADA's
coverage of small employers (<I>Walters v. Metropolitan Educational Enterprises</I>, see
August 1996 <I>Monthly Bulletin</I>, p. 11, concerning how to count employees when
defining a title VII employer) and whether the ADA prohibits employers from
retaliating against former employees (<I>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.</I>). <P>

The ADA clearly prohibits employers from retaliating against employees and
permits them to sue once they are former employees. Title VII prohibits
discrimination based on race, gender, religion and national origin.<P>

<H3>LD students and voc/rehab</H3><P>

Jane Jarrow, president of Disability Access Information &amp; Support in
Columbus, Ohio, said that college and university service providers would be
particularly interested in court decisions affecting students with learning
disabilities and college and university documentation requirements and
substitution policies.<P>

"Another major issue that still looms on the horizon for disability service
providers in higher education is a resolution of the current 'stand-off' between
post-secondary education and the vocational rehabilitation [voc/rehab] system,"
she said. <P>

Some voc/rehab agencies have refused to pay for modifications or accommodations
provided by post-secondary service providers to students who also are voc/rehab
clients, claiming that postsecondary institutions must bear the cost alone (see
September 1996 <I>Monthly Bulletin</I>, p. 8).<P>

<H3>Justice</H3><P>

The civil rights division at Justice, which enforces Titles II and III of the
ADA, will be under new leadership in 1997 due to the resignation of Assistant
Attorney General Deval Patrick, who left to spend more time with his family in
Massachusetts. <P>

Liz Savage, special assistant to Patrick, said, "Deval will be missed. We'll move
on and continue to vigorously enforce the ADA." <P>

"We intend to maintain a balanced enforcement program," Savage said, noting that
Justice does not focus on one issue. <P>

Justice will continue its outreach and technical assistance to small businesses
and expects to expand its use of mediation and alternative dispute resolution,
she noted.<P>

<H3>EEOC</H3><P>

The EEOC also has undergone changes at the top, with the recent resignation of
two of its five commissioners, Gaull Silberman and Joyce Tucker. <P>

While Silberman has been succeeded by Reginald Jones, Tucker's successor has not
yet been chosen.<P>

Commissioner Paul Miller said that the EEOC is considering issuing new policy
guidances in the coming year on plaintiffs who receive Social Security benefits,
long-term disability benefits disparities and psychiatric disabilities.<P>

 Miller also said that he wants to see more ADA enforcement for people with
developmental disabilities (e.g., mental retardation and cerebral palsy). <P>

The EEOC has brought its first claim on behalf of individuals with mental
retardation against Hertz (see August 1996 <I>Monthly Bulletin</I>, p. 5).<P>

Peggy Mastroianni, the EEOC's associate legal counsel, noted that the EEOC would,
as it stated in its national enforcement plan, continue enforcing claims raising
unresolved questions about reasonable accommodation, qualified individual with a
disability, undue hardship and direct threat. She added that the EEOC's ADA staff
would be looking very closely at psychiatric disabilities, people who apply for
other benefits, how the ADA affects temporary employees and reasonable
accommodations. <P>

Although the commission has analyzed reasonable accommodation in its regulations
and technical assistance manual, Mastroianni noted that it has never issued
policy guidance on reasonable accommodation.<P>

She said there are very interesting issues concerning "how the ADA plays out with
temporary employment agencies." <P>

For example, she said the pre-employment inquiry analysis is "a little different"
with temporary employees since there is the question of whether a conditional
offer is made by the temporary agency or its client (i.e., a business using a
temporary agency to perform its work).<P>

<H3>Access Board</H3><P>

The Justice Department and Access Board recently issued proposed guidelines on
children's facilities (see September 1996 <I>Monthly Bulletin</I>, p. 1), and will be
reviewing comments and preparing final rules. <P>

The Access Board also will review the proposed changes to the ADA Accessibility
Guidelines (ADAAG) in preparation for drafting a proposed rule to revise and
update ADAAG (see December 1996 <I>Monthly Bulletin</I>, p. 1).<P>

The Access Board also is working on regulatory negotiation on play areas
(concerning playground equipment), and a notice of proposed rulemaking for
outdoor developed areas (e.g., sports facilities, golf, boating and fishing
facilities, amusement facilities). <P>

Justice and the Access Board are working on a final rule for sections of ADAAG
concerning courtrooms, judicial, legislative, regulatory facilities and detention
and correction facilities.<P>

In addition, the Access Board will continue working on guidance for making
telecommunications equipment and customer services premises equipment
accessible.<P>

<H3>Rehabilitation Act</H3><P>

Congress will probably not tinker with section 504's prohibition on disability
discrimination by federal fund recipients, said Sallie Rhodes, director of client
assistance program training at the National Association of Protection &amp;
Advocacy Systems (NAPAS).<P>

Instead, Congress will focus on return-to-work solutions and getting people off
Social Security rolls when it considers reauthorizing the Rehabilitation Act,
Rhodes maintained. <P>

She said that state voc/rehab agencies increasingly are coming under fire for not
getting the job done and a push already is under way to depend more on private
rehabilitation providers. <P>

In addition to trying to cut costs, privatization will be considered in response
to complaints that voc/rehab agencies are not providing effective services for
people with severe disabilities, Rhodes said. <P>

She characterized privatization as "a bad solution to a very severe resource
problem," and said voc/rehab will "still be a player" since it has used private
providers for years.<P>

<H3>IDEA</H3><P>

People with disabilities have their educational interests at stake as Congress
will try again to reauthorize IDEA. (IDEA provides disabled elementary and
secondary students with a free, appropriate public education requirement.)<P>

Last year, Congress came close to reauthorizing IDEA. The House approved a
proposal to permit cessation of services for students causing certain
disciplinary problems (e.g., having a weapon or drugs in school). <P>

However, Congress could not reach consensus and agreed only to extend IDEA
appropriations for a year. <P>

Many disability rights advocates fear that this proposed exception to IDEA's
"stay-put" rights (during any challenge to a change in placement, the child must
remain in the current educational placement) will resurface. <P>

Curtis Decker, NAPAS' executive director, maintained, "We know if these kids are
thrown out of school they become juvenile delinquents, but they make improvements
if services continue."<P>

<H3>Possible ADA amendments</H3><P>

The 104th Congress, which many feared would limit the reach of the ADA, ended up
expanding its coverage to apply to the legislative and executive branches of the
federal government (see December 1996 <I>Monthly Bulletin</I>, p. 1). <P>

However, the motive may have not been a desire to strengthen disability laws, but
instead to eradicate the perceived hypocritical position of the federal
government exempting itself from the very laws it enacted.<P>

Some business lobbyists remain critical of several aspects of the ADA, and
proposed amendments to the ADA may result. Mary Reed, a lobbyist for the National
Federation of Independent Business (which represents many small businesses),
maintains that the ADA has many problems that need correcting. Reed said these
problems include no exemption for small businesses; vague definitions of
"qualified individual with a disability," "undue hardship" and "readily
achievable"; and excessive penalties.<P>

Gina McDonald, president of the National Council on Independent Living, contended
that the ADA "remains vulnerable" to backlash. <P>

"Clearly we believe that ADA will be under attack again. The most vulnerable
parts will be enforcement, especially of title III, definition of who is a person
with a disability and time lines for cities and states to be in compliance."<P>

One of the 104th Congress' proposed changes to the ADA may not resurface as
quickly as it would have had Rep. William Zeliff, R-N.H., not retired. Zeliff was
one of the main sponsors of the Drug-Free Workplace and Public Safety Assurance
Act of 1996 (H.R. 4017), which proposed amending the ADA and section 504 by
allowing employers to consider an  individual's record of past illegal drug or
alcohol abuse when he or she is applying for or has a "safety-sensitive" job (see
October 1996<I> Monthly Bulletin</I>, p. 14).<P>

Rejecting criticisms of the ADA, McDonald said the media needs to focus more
attention on the law's benefits to society. <P>

She also said that Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., may introduce a community
attendant services act that would establish a national program of community-based
attendant services for people with disabilities and promote this alternative to
institutional services.<P>

During the 104th Congress, Feingold introduced a similar bill (the Long-Term Care
Reform and Deficit Reduction Act, S. 85), which was referred to Senate Committee
on Finance. <P>

<H3><I>Report says ADAAG overhaul needed</I></H3><P>
<h2>Plan advocates narrowing of work area exemption</h2>
A recently issued report proposes that the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG),
an accessibility standard for new construction and alterations, undergo some
changes of its own. Most notably, it suggests narrowing ADAAG's current exemption
for work areas. <P>

David Harris, chair of the 22-member ADAAG review advisory committee, stated, "We
have developed a comprehensive set of recommendations that will help result in
the next edition of the ADAAG being compatible with available technologies, yet
flexible enough to allow the prompt and efficient use of appropriate new
technologies and practices."<P>

But while the committee has proposed greater flexibility in some parts of its
proposed ADAAG, its suggested changes to the work area exemption would impose
more stringent requirements.<P>

Under the current ADAAG and committee's proposed ADAAG, workplace common areas
(e.g., rest rooms, kitchens, meeting rooms) must be accessible. However, unlike
the current ADAAG, the committee's proposed version would exempt only individual
work stations rather than "work areas."<P>

This change would not have a significant impact on many office buildings, which
already have individual work stations (e.g., offices and cubicles) for most of
its employees. <P>

But the change would have a dramatic impact in work settings where individual
work stations are placed in more general work areas that are currently exempt
under ADAAG. Such general work areas would include many restaurant kitchens and
manufacturing plant floors.<P>

The committee proposed retaining most other current ADAAG's substantive
standards. <P>

However, it suggested loosening up some absolute requirements and providing
instead a range of acceptable dimensions. For example, ADAAG currently requires a
bench in an accessible dressing room to be 24 inches by 48 inches. The committee
recommended this be changed to 20 inches to 24 inches in depth and at least 42
inches in length.<P>

A few other recommendations would institute stricter standards. For example,
ADAAG currently requires in places of assembly with fixed seating at least one
accessible wheelchair location for seating capacities from four to 25, two for 26
to 50 seats and four for 51 to 300 seats.<P>

By contrast, the report proposes requiring at least two wheelchair spaces for
assembly areas seating 50 or less, four for 51 to 100 seats and five for 101 to
300 seats.<P>

<H3>New format</H3><P>

While the committee recommended leaving most of ADAAG's current standards intact,
it proposed completely reorganizing ADAAG's format. ADAAG currently is divided
into 10 sections. (Sections 11-14 still are interim and section 15 was proposed
recently, see September 1996 <I>Monthly Bulletin</I>, p. 1). Although the committee has
proposed 10 chapters, any resemblance between its proposed structure for ADAAG
and ADAAG's current organization ends there.<P>

The committee recommended separating "scoping" requirements (e.g., how many
features and which spaces must be accessible) entirely from its technical
requirements (e.g., the range of dimensions that must be met for areas to satisfy
accessibility standards). Although ADAAG currently places many scoping
requirements at its outset, the proposed ADAAG sets them off in their own
chapter.<P>

Another proposed format change -- the committee suggested expanding a few
subsections in ADAAG (e.g., subsections on accessible routes and built-in
furnishings) into chapters of their own. <P>

Other suggested changes in format include adding several new charts to help
clarify standards. For example, charts showing the required number of accessible
rooms for accessible transient lodging (e.g., motels and dorms) show that
facilities with 51 to 75 rooms must have three accessible rooms and one room with
a roll-in shower. The chart does not say whether the room with a roll-in shower
may be one of the three accessible rooms or must be an additional accessible
room.<P>

The committee's proposed chart would instead have separate columns showing the
number of required accessible rooms without roll-in showers, accessible rooms
with roll-in showers and total number of required accessible rooms.<P>

<title>Mental health parity law enactedp</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<P>
<h2>Mental health parity law enacted</h2>

Mental health advocates have won a major victory, the enactment of the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996,
mandating that employers offer similar health insurance coverage for both physical and mental illnesses. Its
enactment follows a failed attempt to include it in the health insurance portability reform bill (September
1996 <I>Monthly Bulletin</I>, p. 14).<P>

While a breakthrough in mental health coverage, however, many employers' health benefit plans will not be
required to provide parity under this new law. (Employers are not required to provide parity under the
ADA.)<P>

On Sept. 5, the Senate adopted the parity act as an amendment (introduced by Sens. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.) to H.R. 3666 (an appropriations bill for the Departments of Veterans Affairs
and Housing and Urban Development). House-Senate conferees accepted the language and President Clinton
signed it into law on Sept. 26.<P>

The act will prohibit group health plans from capping aggregate lifetime or annual benefits for mental health
service but not for medical or surgical services. Most insurance policies include a $50,000 lifetime cap for
treatments for mental illness, while physical illnesses, like cancer or heart disease, are capped at $1
million or more, Domenici maintained.<P>

Domenici praised House members for accepting the Senate-approved mental health parity language, stating,
"This has been a very long and difficult effort, but I'm pleased that we have finally succeeded. ... This
represents a first step by the Congress to bring the nation to terms with caring for the millions of
Americans who suffer from these diseases of the brain."<P>

<H3>Exemptions</H3>

Although a significant piece of legislation, the act was scaled back significantly from the one originally
introduced. Instead, in a compromise with employers, proponents agreed to exempt businesses with fewer
than 50 employees and delay the effective date until 1998.<P>

Moreover, the amendment will not apply if it increases premiums by 1 percent or more, as a result of
language added by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.<P>

Paul Fronstin, research associate with the Employee Benefits Research Institute, said that Gramm's
amendment will result in the parity amendment having a "very limited impact on employers." However, he
said the act does not clarify whether employers must first provide parity and then see if their premiums
are affected or instead may "opt out" from providing parity based on actuarial projections. <P>

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that employers will incur a cost of less than 2/10 of 1
percent in health premiums by providing parity, or about 60 cents in additional costs per member per
month.<P>

Lee Carty, director of communications at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law in Washington, D.C.,
said that employees in Maryland and Minnesota did not see their rates increase by the threshold 1 percent
after those states enacted mental health protections. <P>

Carty noted the limits of the law's reach, describing it as a "first step in providing equality for people who
have mental illness and first step in fairness." She said the parity act will not prohibit employers from
having lower copayments for people who have mental disabilities than people who have physical disabilities.
Further, employers will not have to provide mental health coverage under the law, she stated.<P>

While the EEOC provides that parity is not required under the ADA for people with mental and physical
disabilities, Shelley Jackson, a staff attorney at the Bazelon Center, said mental health advocates will
challenge differences in health care coverage  under the ADA and the Mental Health Parity Act. Such
disparities "stand in the way of people with mental disabilities trying to gain self sufficiency through
employment," she said.   <P>

<title> Employer's Guide to the Fair Labor Standards Act </title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/person/wage/wagehead.gif" alt="Employer's Guide to the Fair Labor
Standards Act">
<P>
<h2>Recent Congressional Hearing Addresses Community College Employees, Teen Drivers </h2>
<P>

After raising the minimum wage and clarifying the compensability of employee commuting time, the 104th
Congress turned its attention to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) one last time before adjournment. <P>

On Sept. 12, the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Subcommittee on Workforce Protections
discussed three notable FLSA bills. They covered classification of community college employees, teenagers
driving on the job and law enforcement training compensation. <P>

Rep. Randy Tate (R-Wash.) and a panel of private- and public-sector representatives discussed the topics,
although significant action on the measures is not expected until the 105th Congress begins work next
spring. <P>

<H3>Exemption for Certain College Employees</H3><P>

One bill (H.R. 2134) discussed at the hearing would grant an exemption from the overtime provisions of the
FLSA to "classified" employees (support staff workers) at community colleges who also served as
"certified" teaching employees. Classified employees include such school workers as custodians, cafeteria
workers, bus drivers and secretaries. The bill in question, introduced July 17, 1995, by Rep. George P.
Radanovich, R-Calif., would add a provision to the FLSA at 29 U.S.C. 213(b) (see Appendix I of the
<I>Guide</I>).<P>

Currently, under the FLSA, when an employee serves in two different capacities for the same employer and
is paid at different rates for these duties, the hours worked in both jobs must be combined, and, if the
weekly total exceeds 40, overtime must be paid for the excess hours. Also, an employer must ensure that
both rates of pay are reflected in the employee's "regular rate of pay" (the basis for overtime calculation)
by adding the compensation for both jobs and dividing by the number of hours worked (to get a "weighted"
average, see &#182;510 of the <I>Guide</I>). <P>

Hearing witness Don Hall spoke on behalf of the American Association of Classified School Employees and a
related California state association in support of the bill. Hall formerly worked in two different capacities
at the same community college in California as both a painter (a classified employee) and an art history
instructor (a certified employee).  <P>

Hall did not receive overtime pay for hours he worked over 40 in a week until the U.S. Department of Labor
(DOL) found in a May 28, 1991, Wage and Hour Division opinion letter that an employee in a similar position
was entitled to pay for overtime hours at the adjusted rate described above. Hall then lost the art
instructor position and was forced to seek certified employment at another community college. <P>

At the hearing, Hall agreed that employees in his position should receive compensation for overtime work in
their regular positions as classified employees (the Radanovich bill would provide such a protection).
However, he said, his work as a teacher was an "entirely different line of work" from his job as a painter,
and it was "only by coincidence that the employer for each position [was] the same."   <P>

Moreover, while Hall stressed that the unions he represented would not support amendments to the FLSA
that would "compromise its crucial protections of the American worker," he maintained the Radanovich
legislation "has been carefully crafted in a manner that in no way threatens the integrity" of the act. He
pointed out that the bill's use of the terms "classified position" and "certified or other academic capacity"
would limit its scope, applying the legislation only to the "group of employees who have asked for the
exemption." <P>

<H3>Teenage Drivers on the Job</H3><P>

Meanwhile, Rep. Tate led a discussion on the regularity with which employees under age 18 should be
permitted to drive automobiles on the job under the FLSA's child labor provisions. Current FLSA
implementing regulations require that on-the-job driving for minors be limited to operation of vehicles
(under a certain weight and during daylight hours) that is "occasional and incidental to the minor's
employment" (29 C.F.R. &#167;570.52; see Appendix II of the <I>Guide</I>). <P>

According to Tate, the current DOL definition of "occasional" is no more than once a week and four times a
month on average. The term "incidental," Tate said, means no more than 20 percent of work in a workday
and 5 percent in a workweek. A bill (H.R. 2089) introduced July 20, 1995, by Tate would alter the
regulations to stipulate only that driving by minors "not be the primary duty of the minor's employment."
<P>

In 1994, DOL imposed fines on certain businesses for allowing minors to drive in situations other than "rare
and emergency situations," a practice that Tate criticized. Hearing witness Ed Fitzpatrick, a representative
of the Washington State Auto Dealers Association, pointed out that the "rare and emergency situations"
standard is higher than the "occasional and incidental" standard set forth in the regulations. This DOL
action, he said, has thwarted the efforts of many employers who wanted to "offer job opportunities to
teenagers and provide them with meaningful work experience," but now have cut back on such positions out
of fear of being fined by DOL.      <P>

Tate and a representative of the Child Labor Coalition of the National Consumers League (who opposed the
bill) clashed on the issue of safety in teenage driving. While Tate cited a study indicating the threat of
accidents is no worse for minors than adults, the critic pointed to statistics naming teenage drivers as
those with the worst accident records, adding that driving by minors on the job is simply unsafe (see
&#182;&#182;740, 750).<P>

A law enforcement training time bill (H.R. 4172) was also discussed at the hearing and would exempt law
enforcement officers from the FLSA's overtime protections while they attended apprenticeship training
programs. All three bills were referred to the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities;
H.R. 2134 and H.R. 2089 were subsequently referred to the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.<P>

<title>9th Circuit Affirms Its Stand on When Workers Were 'Subject to'
Docking</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/person/fair/fairhead.gif"></center>
<P>
<h2>9th Circuit Affirms Its Stand on When Workers Were 'Subject to' Docking</h2>

In two separate rulings issued Aug. 2, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held
that a worker, exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), may be "subject
to" improper pay deductions if an express policy for such deductions exists, even
if the worker has not experienced any deductions. <P>

The rulings followed several recent decisions by other federal appeals courts
concerning the "subject to" question. Several of these courts have agreed with
the 9th Circuit that the mere existence of a violative pay-docking policy may
destroy an employee's FLSA exemption (<I>Balgowan v. New Jersey Department of
Transportation,</I> No. 95-5276 (3rd Cir. 1996), <I>Current Developments,</I> July 1996,
page 1). Other federal appeals courts (including those for the 5th, 8th and 11th
Circuits) have held that prohibited pay docking generally needs to have occurred
for the exemption to be lost. <P>

Although the reasoning used by the 9th Circuit in its Aug. 2 rulings was
consistent with its stance on the issue, the findings returned in the two cases
it reviewed were dissimilar. In <I>Hackett v. Lane County</I> (No. 95-35283, Aug. 2,
1996), the court found that the exempt employees in question -- supervisors in a
sheriff's office -- had not experienced improper pay reductions, nor had they
been "subject to" improper deductions due to an employer's "express policy." In
<I>McGuire v. City of Portland, Ore.</I> (No. 95-35391, Aug. 2, 1996), however, the
court ruled that the employer did have in place a specific policy that made the
employees -- fire battalion chiefs -- "subject to" improper deductions, even
though no actual pay docking had occurred. <P>

<H3><I>Hackett v. Lane County</I></H3>

The FLSA provides that, in general, employees are entitled to overtime payments
for all hours worked in excess of 40 per week. A worker classified as a bona fide
executive, administrative or professional (EAP) employee, however, is exempt from
the overtime provisions of the law. In <I>Hackett</I>, the sheriff's office supervisors
had been classified by their employer as exempt executives or administrators. <P>

To qualify for one of the EAP exemptions, an employee must meet the requirements
of both the FLSA's "duties test" and the "salary test" for the exemption in
question. The fact that the employees in <I>Hackett</I> satisfied the duties test, as
either executives or administrators (see Tab 200 of the <I>Handbook</I>), was not in
dispute. <P>

To meet the FLSA's salary basis test (see &#182;222 of the <I>Handbook</I>), an employee
must, in general, regularly receive "a predetermined amount constituting all or
part of his [or her] compensation, which amount is not subject to reduction
because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed" (emphasis
added; 29 C.F.R. &#167;541.118(a), Appendix II, pages 49-50). <P>

Salaried employees must be paid for any week in which they perform work, but need
not receive payment for weeks in which no work is performed. Also, deductions
from the pay of a salaried employee taken in increments of less than one week are
generally not permissible for a week in which an employee performs any work.
However, an employer may dock employee pay for less than one week's work for
violations of safety rules of major significance -- that is, rules "relating to
the prevention of serious danger" (29 C.F.R. &#167;541.118(a)(5), Appendix II,
page 50). <P>

The supervisory employees in <I>Hackett</I> asserted that they did not meet the salary
basis test because their pay was "subject to wage deductions pursuant to
disciplinary suspensions unrelated to safety violations, and lasting for periods
of less than a week." The U.S. District Court for Oregon held that the employees
were not subject to unlawful suspensions, and the 9th Circuit affirmed.<P>

According to the appeals court, the employees conceded that they had not actually
received a disciplinary suspension of less than a week. However, this fact alone
did not resolve the case. The "critical question," the court said, was whether
the employees were "subject to" an improper suspension, rather than whether their
pay had actually been docked.<P>

In <I>Barner v. City of Novato</I> (17 F.3d 1256 (1994)), the 9th Circuit ruled that
where no actual pay deduction has occurred, to establish that an employee has
been subject to such a deduction, an employer must have in place an "express
policy" allowing improper pay docking. Applying this standard to <I>Hackett</I>, the
appeals court reviewed two documents it said could have established the existence
of such a policy: a personnel manual for public safety employees and a manual
that applied to all county employees.<P>

The court stated that neither of the manuals expressly permitted a disciplinary
suspension prohibited by the FLSA for exempt workers. The public safety manual
"provide[d] for disciplinary suspension without pay for a multitude of
infractions," but did not specify how long such a suspension would last, the
court said. Further, the second manual provided that employees could receive
disciplinary suspensions of less than one week only for major safety violations,
a practice permitted by the act.<P>

The court found that the two manuals, when read together, "create[d] an express
policy against disciplinary suspensions [except for major safety violations] for
increments of less than a week." Because the employer did not violate the salary
basis test in this regard, the court found that the employees were exempt from
receiving overtime under the FLSA.<P>

<H3><I>McGuire v. City of Portland, Ore.</I></H3> <P>

In <I>McGuire,</I> the second case reviewed by the court, fire battalion chiefs, like
the sheriff's office employees in <I>Hackett,</I> had been deemed administrators or
executives. However, in <I>McGuire,</I> and in contrast to <I>Hackett,</I> the court found that
the employees had <I>not</I> been paid on a salary basis, because their employer -- a
city -- had subjected them to partial-week pay reductions for infractions of
regulations other than major safety rules.<P>

The court found that the city's "express, published policy" provided that all
city employees could "suffer disciplinary suspensions with loss of pay for a
variety of offenses and infractions." The policy permitted, contrary to the FLSA,
an unpaid suspension in a week in which an employee had performed work.<P>

The city argued that its policy did not destroy the workers' FLSA-exempt status
because none of the battalion chiefs had ever received such a reduction and the
city did not intend to impose one. However, citing its precedential ruling in
<I>Abshire v. County of Kern</I> (908 F.2d 483 (1990)), in which the court held that
"employees were not salaried where an express policy provided for 'invalid'
deductions, even though the county had never in fact imposed such deductions,"
the court rejected the city's argument. The employer had an "express policy"
subjecting the employees to improper pay deductions, the court found. Therefore,
the court ruled that the battalion chiefs were not paid on a salary basis.<P>

In a related argument, the city also maintained that certain provisions of the
FLSA that prohibit workers from receiving certain pay reductions preclude public
employers from "taking advantage of" the EAP exemptions, and therefore are
contrary to congressional intent. But while the 9th Circuit recognized that
principles of public accountability necessitate that public employers be allowed
to dock exempt employee pay for partial-day absences (see &#182;222 of the
<I>Handbook</I>), the court did not apply this reasoning to the practice of disciplinary
suspensions.<P>

Quoting the U.S. Department of Labor, the court concluded that "employers have a
broad array of disciplinary means available with which to satisfy public
accountability without defeating the executive or administrative exemption." <P>

<head><title>Chicken Pox Was a Serious Health Condition</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/person/time/timehead.gif" alt="Family and Medical Leave Handbook">
<P>
<h2>Chicken Pox Was a Serious Health Condition </h2>
<P>
An employee suffering from chicken pox should have been placed on medical leave under the Family and
Medical Leave Act (FMLA) instead of having his employment terminated for absenteeism, the U.S. District
Court for Northern Ohio ruled recently.<P>

William George filed suit against his employer, Associated Stationers Inc., alleging it violated his rights
under the FMLA when it terminated him for excessive absences from work. George was employed as part of
the company's "flex-force" team comprised of seasonal employees hired to work in the company's
warehouse.<P>

From Feb. 9, 1994, through Dec. 12, 1994, George missed six days of work, was late three days and
worked one partial day. Marco DeSciscio, George's supervisor, issued the employee a written warning
about his attendance problems that included the statement that "another occurrence will result in further
disciplinary action up to and including termination."<P>

On Dec. 31, 1994, George began to feel ill; his condition worsened over the next several days until on Jan.
3, 1995, vesicles  covered his skin. George called DeSciscio and informed the supervisor that he could not
report to work because he had chicken pox. DeSciscio met with the company distribution supervisor and the
area manager, and they decided to terminate George's employment.<P>

Several days later George went to the hospital emergency room, where he was examined and diagnosed
with chicken pox. The attending physician instructed George to stay home from work until the vesicles had
dried up and to return in one week for a check-up. The physician testified that "because the skin vesicles
were evident at the time of George's visit . . . his was a 'highly contagious condition' and thus he was unable
to go to work until the period of contagion had passed." George was cleared to return to work after his
follow-up examination.<P>

<H3>Chicken Pox as a 'Serious Health Condition'</H3><P>

Associated Stationers conceded that they knew George did not report to work because he had chicken pox.
They said that he was terminated in accordance with the company's attendance policy and argued that
chicken pox was not a serious health condition as defined in the FMLA.<P>

Under the law, a serious health condition is defined as "an illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental
condition that involves . . . continuing treatment by a health care provider" (29 U.S.C. &#167;101(11), see
Appendix I of the <I>Handbook</I>). The U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) regulations further define continuing
treatment to include an incapacity of three or more consecutive days and "treatment two or more times by
a health care provider" (29 C.F.R. &#167;825.114(a)(2)(i)(A), see Appendix II of the <I>Handbook</I>). The
regulations do not stipulate a time period in which the two "treatments" must take place.<P>

Associated Stationers argued that the FMLA was intended "to cover only those employees with chronic or
debilitating conditions." The regulations explicitly cover "chronic and debilitating conditions" (29 C.F.R.
&#167;&#167;825.114(a)(iii)-(iv)), but neither the regulations nor the statute limit the definition of
serious health condition to just such illnesses, the court noted. <P>

DOL's regulations exclude such conditions as the common cold, ear aches and upset stomach from
classification as a serious health condition (29 C.F.R. &#167;825.800). However, the court stated that
"here [George] had the requisite two treatments . . . was told by his physician that he could not work until
the vesicles were covered . . . and was contagious until at least January 9. This is a different situation than
that of an employee suffering from an ear ache or common cold."<P>

The employer also claimed that a serious health condition required an employee to prove that he or she
could not perform the "essential functions of his job as those functions are defined by the Americans with
Disabilities Act [ADA]." However, the court pointed out that the regulations under FMLA state that the
FMLA's "serious health condition" and the ADA's "disability" are two distinct and separate concepts, "and
must be analyzed separately" (29 C.F.R. &#167;825.702).<P>

The court also noted that George was not required by the FMLA to invoke the law in order to be covered by
its stipulations. Once the employee contacted the company and explained his health-related situation, "the
obligation shifted to the employer to determine whether leave was sought under the act and to obtain any
additional information," the district court said, citing the U.S. District Court for Middle Tennessee (<I>Brannon
v. Oshkosh B'Gosh Inc.</I>, 897 F. Supp. 1028 (1995)). The court ruled that George had a serious health
condition as defined under the FMLA at the time of his termination.<P>

<H3>The Employer's Attendance Policy</H3><P>

George's suit also maintained that his employer's attendance policy violated the FMLA. Associated
Stationers argued that its policy was not a violation, but merely stated that "the attendance policy . . .
simply required that employees report illnesses, including medical documentation thereof, and that a
medical leave, if properly documented, will count as one 'occurrence' regardless of the length of said
leave."<P>

Associated Stationers cited several court cases decided under the ADA to show that absenteeism was a
valid basis for termination. However, the court noted that the ADA was established to level "the playing
field for disabled individuals to allow them to compete with nondisabled employees," while the FMLA "was
designed to entitle employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons." The district court ruled that
the ADA cases cited were irrelevant.<P>

The court classified the employer's policy as "no-fault," meaning that an employee's absence other than for
vacation was classified as an "occurrence" and counted in the company's point system, which was the basis
for its disciplinary actions.<P>

The FMLA specifically states that FMLA leave cannot be counted under "no fault" attendance policies as an
occurrence (29 C.F.R. &#167;825.220(c)). "An attendance policy which does not except as an 'occurrence'
an absence caused by a serious medical condition violated the [FMLA]," the court ruled, adding that if an
employee's last absence was due to a serious health condition as defined by the FMLA, the employer "may
not terminate the employee based upon its absenteeism policy."<P>

The district court ruled in favor of George's motion for summary judgment on the issue of liability and
overruled Associated Stationers' similar motion for dismissal. (<I>George v. Associated Stationers Inc.,</I> N.D.
Ohio, 932 F. Supp. 1012, June 3, 1996; 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14670)<P>

<head><title>Arbitration Ruled Enforceable for FMLA Claims</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/person/time/timehead.gif" alt="Family and Medical Leave Handbook">
<P>
<h2>Arbitration Ruled Enforceable for FMLA Claims</h2>

Claims brought under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) are subject to compulsory arbitration
clauses contained in employment agreements signed by employers and employees, the U.S. District Court
for Northern Texas held recently.<P>

P. Stephen Satarino brought suit against his employer, A.G. Edwards Inc., claiming the firm had violated his
rights under the FMLA and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) when it terminated his employment
after he suffered serious injuries in an automobile accident. These injuries compromised his
information-processing abilities, and made him unable to work for as long or as productively as he did prior
to the accident.<P>

The employee maintained that Edwards interfered with his right to take leave under the FMLA for medical
care and physical therapy. Satarino also argued that Edwards retaliated against him for exercising his
FMLA rights, did not post the required FMLA notices and failed to make the required updates to the
employee handbook, and discriminated and retaliated against him for opposing discriminatory FMLA
practices.<P>

Edwards argued that Satarino's claims should be dismissed because the employee had agreed to "binding and
enforceable arbitration" of his claims when he signed a Supplementary Training Agreement for an
Investment Broker, an Investment Broker Agreement and a National Association of Securities Dealers Inc.
Form U-4. The employee signed these forms in conjunction with his employment with Edwards.<P>

The training agreement stated that:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Any controversy or dispute arising between [Satarino] and Edwards in respect to this agreement or [his]
employment by Edwards shall be submitted for arbitration before the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., or the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

The broker agreement contained a section entitled "Arbitration," which stated:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>[Satarino] agree[s] that any controversy or dispute arising between [Satarino] and Edwards in respect to
this agreement or [his] employment by Edwards shall be submitted for arbitration before the New York
Stock Exchange, Inc., or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

The Form U-4 that Satarino signed provided as follows:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I agree to arbitrate any dispute, claim or controversy that may arise between me and my firm, or a
customer, or any other person, that is required to be arbitrated under the rules, constitutions, or by-laws
of the organizations indicated in Item 10 as may be amended from time to time and that any arbitration
award rendered against me may be entered as a judgement [sic] in any court of competent jurisdiction.<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Citing the U.S. Supreme Court's holdings in <I>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction
Corp.</I>, 460 U.S. 1, 24, 74 (1983), and <I>AT&amp;T Technologies Inc. v. Communications Workers of
America</I>, 475 U.S. 643, 650 (1986), the district court stated that the Federal Arbitration Act set a
"liberal policy favoring arbitration agreements" and that any doubts about the applicability of an arbitration
clause should be decided in favor of arbitration. In addition, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has
jurisdiction over the Texas district court, recently ruled that a claim of discrimination brought under Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was subject to mandatory arbitration (<I>Rojas v. TK Communications Inc.</I>,
87 F.3d 745 (1996)).<P>

The district court applied Rojas to the immediate case, stating that "the three agreements are
unquestionably of adequate breadth to support compulsory arbitration." The court noted that both the
training and broker agreements' arbitration clauses stated that "any controversy or dispute" between
Satarino and Edwards with respect to Satarino's employment must be arbitrated. Form U-4 contained
similar language.<P>

Satarino, citing the U.S. District Court for Southern New York's ruling in <I>Hoffman v. Aaron Kamhi Inc.</I>, 927
F. Supp. 640 (1996), argued that because the arbitration clauses did not explicitly refer to the FMLA or
ADA, an employee could not be forced to arbitrate such claims (see December 1996 <I>Current Developments</I>,
page 7). However, the district court distinguished the facts in <I>Hoffman</I> from those in the present case on
the basis that <I>Hoffman's</I> arbitration provision was "poorly worded and ambiguously phrased."<P>

Moreover, the Texas district court added that it was bound by the decisions of the 5th Circuit, so "to the
extent that <I>Hoffman</I> would require a different result, <I>Rojas</I> controls," the court said.<P>

Satarino did not specifically address <I>Rojas</I>, but maintained that FMLA and ADA claims are distinct from
actions brought under Title VII and, thus, "particularly inappropriate for arbitration." The 5th Circuit has
not addressed whether FMLA and ADA claims can be subjected to compulsory arbitration, but the district
court predicted that the appellate court would uphold such employment agreements due to its lack of
hesitancy in the <I>Rojas</I> decision.<P>

The district court cited the Supreme Court's holding in <I>Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.</I>, 500 U.S.
26 (1991), where the Court stated that if Congress had not intended FMLA claims to be resolved through
arbitration, "it will be discoverable in the text of the [act], its legislative history, or an 'inherent conflict'
between arbitration and the [act's] underlying purposes." Although the FMLA does not explicitly provide for
arbitration of claims, the law "contains nothing to suggest that agreements to arbitrate are unenforceable,"
the court said, ruling that contractual agreements to arbitrate FMLA claims were enforceable. (<I>Satarino v.
A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.</I>, N.D. Texas, Civil Action No. 3:96-CV-1587-D, Oct. 23, 1996) <P>

<Title>States Offer Financial Aid for Meeting 1998 Deadline</Title> <P>

<body background="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif>
<IMG SRC = "/tpg/enviro/ustt/ustthead.gif" alt="Underground Storage Tank Guide"></IMG><P>


<h2>States Offer Financial Aid for Meeting Upcoming 1998 Deadline</h2><P>
<body>

Underground storage tank (UST) owners in 14 states can rely on state programs for
financial assistance in meeting the 1998 tank upgrade or replacement deadline,
according to a recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report (see
related story, p. 1).<P>

There are nine state direct loan programs, six of which are available only to
small businesses. The programs have interest rates ranging from 0 percent to as
high as 7.5 percent, the report stated. In two state interest subsidy programs,
the state contributes funds to reduce interest rates provided by private lenders.
At least 96 percent of eligible applicants who submit an application obtain a
subsidy, according to the report.<P>

In three state loan guarantee programs the state assumes a portion of the default
risk to encourage banks to loan money to tank owners, the report said. All three
programs are available only to small businesses and guarantee most of the loan
amount. Many loan program administrators reported that even with state loan
guarantees, some banks still are reluctant to loan money to tank owners for fear
of environmental liability.<P>

Of four state grant programs, only one is limited to small businesses, although
the other programs limit eligibility to financially needy businesses, the report
said. Oregon applicants must guarantee that they will remain in business for a
specified period. <P>

Information on the state financial assistance programs discussed below was
obtained from the EPA report.<P>

<h3>California</h3><P>

California's Replacement of Underground Storage Tank Loan Fund offers low
interest loans to small-business UST owners for tank upgrades, repairs, removals
or minor corrective actions. <P>

The state has made 114 loans totaling $16,665,723 since December 1994. Program
officials currently are reviewing 25 loan applications, which total $4,443,215.
Since the onset of the project, the state has declined 64 applications. Program
participants had no complaints about the program and found participation to be
relatively easy, according to the report.<P>

The minimum loan per borrower is $10,000, and the maximum loan is $350,000. Loans
with real estate as collateral must be repaid within 20 years, and loans with
other collateral must be repaid within 10 years. Each loan includes a 2 percent
loan fee. For more information, contact the California Trade and Commerce Agency,
Office of Small Business, Erik Watkins, loan officer; (916) 323-9879; or Jim La
Tanner, loan officer, (916) 327-3104.<P>

<h3>Delaware</h3><P>

Delaware's Small Retail Gasoline Station Assistance Program provides low interest
loans--at 2 percent above the Federal Reserve discount rate--to certain retail
service stations for installation of air quality protection devices, replacement
of existing UST systems, removal or abandonment and subsequent replacement of UST
systems, and installation of water quality protection devices. To be eligible for
the program, stations must:<P>

<UL>
<LI>have an average monthly throughput for gasoline and/or special fuels
(diesel) of less than 75,001 gallons for the previous 12 months; <P>

<LI>qualify as a small business under the definition used by the Small Business
Administration (SBA); and<P>

<LI>have a pre-construction inspection so that the Department of Natural
Resources and Environmental Control can inform the station of its upgrade
needs.<P>
</UL>

To date, four tank owners have applied for loans and been approved. Two
applications are under review. Program contacts indicated that tank owners and
operators have had difficulty using the 15-page application, because of its
length and the type of information requested.<P>

The maximum loan amount per borrower is $100,000 or 90 percent of the entire
project cost, whichever is less. Participants must pay a minimum of 10 percent of
the entire project cost. The loan must be repaid within seven years. For more
information, contact the Underground Storage Tank Branch at (302) 323-4588.<P>

<h3>Hawaii</h3><P>

The Hawaii Capital Loan Program-Underground Storage Tank Loan Account offers
direct, low interest loans--at 1 percent below the Prime Rate or 7.5 percent,
whichever is lower--and participates in loans from private lending institutions
for upgrades, replacements, closures and remedial actions. <P>

The state legislature has threatened to eliminate funding because of a perceived
lack of interest in the fund, the report said. According to program
administrators, few loan applications have been received  because UST owners do
not consider upgrades to be an urgent need. To date, the program has processed
one loan application and granted a $140,000 loan. <P>

The maximum direct loan is $1 million per borrower. The maximum state portion for
a participation loan  is $1 million or 90 percent of the total amount, whichever
is less, per borrower. For more information, contact the Hawaii Capital Loan
Program, Financial Assistance Branch, Department of Business, Economic
Development and Tourism, Grosvenor Center, Mauka Tower, 737 Bishop St., Suite
1900, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813; (808) 586-2576.<P>

<h3>Idaho</h3><P>

Idaho's Underground Storage Tank Financing Program is a loan guarantee and
interest subsidy program that provides assistance to gasoline station owners and
oil dealers for tank upgrades and replacements. To qualify for a program loan, a
business first must qualify for a loan through its commercial bank and through
the Small Business Administration (SBA).<P>

The only problem program administrators reported was a continuing hesitancy by
banks to loan money to UST owners for fear of incurring potential cleanup
liability, particularly when UST owners do not carry insurance policies, the
report said. To date, tank owners have submitted 14 applications to the program,
and seven loans totaling $496,000 have been approved. Six applications are
pending and one was either declined or withdrawn.<P>

The fixed interest rate to the borrower is 6 percent. SBA guarantees a maximum of
90 percent of the loan with the lending institution responsible for the 10
percent unguaranteed portion. For more information, contact the Idaho State
Treasurer's Office, Liza Carberry; (208) 334-3203.<P>

<h3>Iowa</h3><P>

The Iowa Comprehensive Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Fund-Guaranteed Loan
Program guarantees loans to tank owners or operators for capital improvements,
including tank upgrades, cleanups or capital purchases of property. To qualify
for a guarantee, the tank owner or operator must independently own and operate a
petroleum UST site; own less than 12 tanks at not more than two sites; have a net
worth of $400,000 or less; and demonstrate that he or she was unable to obtain
financing from at least two private lending institutions.<P>

To date, the program has approved 28 applications and reviewed 40 applications,
the report said. There is no maximum loan amount for the guarantee, but the
maximum guarantee is 90 percent of the loan. Interest rates may be either
variable or fixed and the maximum loan period is 20 years. Loan applicants must
pay an application fee of $150. For details, contact Williams and Company at
(712) 252-1455.<P>

<h3>Maine</h3><P>

Maine's Oil Storage Facility or Tank Replacement Program provides direct loans,
loan guarantees and grants to commercial underground and aboveground oil storage
tank or facility owners and local governments for tank upgrades, replacements,
removals, disposals and purchases of air quality equipment. <P>

To qualify, an applicant must demonstrate that its tank or facility is leaking,
or must be removed or replaced as required by law; it is financially needy; and
is a commercial entity that does not own more than a 50 percent stake in more
than one tank facility location. For a loan guarantee, the applicant also must
demonstrate that it qualifies for a bank loan. For a grant, the applicant also
must demonstrate non-profit status and hardship.<P>

To date, the program has approved 143 of 249 applications submitted. Of the
remaining 106 applications, fewer than 50 percent were denied and the rest were
withdrawn, according to program officials. For details, contact the Finance
Authority of Maine, 83 Western Ave., P.O. Box 949, Augusta, Maine 04332-0949;
(207) 623-3263; fax (207) 623-0095.<P>

Maine has another financial assistance program, called the Residential
Underground Oil Storage Tank Removal Program, that provides interest free loans
and grants to residential tank owners and operators for replacements, removals
and disposal of tanks. For more information, contact the Maine State Housing
Authority, 353 Water St., Augusta, Maine 04338-2669; (207) 626-HOME; (800)
452-4668.<P>

<h3>Maryland</h3><P>

The Maryland Underground Storage Tank Upgrade and Replacement Fund Loan Program
provides low interest loans to private tank owners for UST removals, replacements
and upgrades. To qualify, a tank owner must: <P>

<UL>
<LI>be in compliance with all federal and state laws and regulations; <P>

<LI>have registered its tanks before July 1, 1991; <P>

<LI>demonstrate the legal capacity to incur the obligations of a loan; <P>

<LI>demonstrate creditworthiness, collateral and other security; and<P>

<LI>provide a letter of intent to apply for assistance.<P>
</UL>

To date, the program has approved 30 of the 200 applications submitted by tank
owners. No applications have been denied: 30 applications are being processed and
140 were withdrawn. Applicants report that the applications are difficult to use
and they found it difficult to meet collateral requirements because they are
reluctant to sign personal guarantees, according to the report.<P>

The interest rate is equal to the yield of the most recent sale on state general
obligation bonds, which currently is 6 percent. Loans must be repaid within 15
years. The maximum loan amount is $50,000 per site, or $150,000 per owner per
year. For more information, contact the Maryland Department of the Environment,
UST Upgrade and Replacement Fund Office, Cindy Bojokles; (410) 631-3095.<P>

<h3>Massachusetts</h3><P>

Massachusetts' Underground Storage Tank Petroleum Product Cleanup Fund is a grant
program available to cities, towns, districts and other political bodies for tank
replacement, removal and closure. The fund went into effect May 19. For more
information, contact the fund at (617) 727-3200, ext. 628.<P>

<h3>Michigan</h3><P>

The Michigan Underground Storage Tank Financial Assurance (MUSTFA) Act-Interest
Subsidy Program provides an interest subsidy on loans for replacement and upgrade
of petroleum UST systems. To qualify for assistance, a business must be in
compliance with MUSTFA registration requirements. Program administrators
indicated that approximately 99 percent of applicants who complete the
application process are approved for the subsidy.<P>

The subsidy is for the first $200,000 of a loan per owner or operator. The
maximum period of interest subsidization is 10 years. For more information,
contact the MUSTFA Fund Administrator, Department of Natural Resources, 333 South
Capitol Ave., Town Center, 2nd Floor, Lansing, Mich. 48933; (517) 373-6247; and
the Department of Treasury, Cash/Debt Management Section, P.O. Box 15128,
Lansing, Mich. 48901; (517) 373-8404. <P>

<h3>Ohio</h3><P>

Ohio's Petroleum UST Linked Deposit Program offers an interest subsidy on loans
for replacement and upgrade of petroleum UST systems. Since the start of the
program in 1989, $1.6 million has been invested for subsidization, of which
$600,000 is outstanding investments. <P>

The $500,000 budget has not been expended, but program administrators expect to
receive more applications and grant more interest subsidies as the Dec. 22, 1998,
deadline approaches and awareness of the program increases. Of 23 applications
submitted to the program to date, 22 have been approved and one has been
denied.<P>

The interest rate subsidy for the first $100,000 of a loan per owner or operator
reduces the fixed borrowing rate by 3 percent. The maximum period of interest
subsidization is four years. For details, contact the Ohio Underground Storage
Tank Release Compensation Board at (614) 752-8963.<P>

<h3>Oregon</h3><P>

The Oregon Underground Storage Tank Financial Assistance Program-Tier IV
Essential Services Grant is available to UST motor fuel station owners and
operators and certain property owners in the state. The grant, which is the
lesser of $75,000 or 75 percent of the entire project cost, is for tank upgrades,
replacements, corrective action associated with upgrade or replacement, and
installation of pollution control equipment.<P>

Although the program works well, the grant is inadequate when severe soil and
groundwater contamination are present, and there are no provisions for tank
closure only, according to program administrators. For more information, contact
the Department of Environmental Quality, UST Financial Assistance Coordinator,
811 S.W. 6th Ave., Portland, Ore. 97204; (503) 229-5870; (800) 452-4011.<P>

Oregon also has another general assistance program, the UST Pollution Control Tax
Credit, that offers a 50 percent Oregon business income tax credit based on the
total costs of eligible project improvements. The credit can be used to cover UST
upgrades and replacements, and is available to tank owners and operators
regardless of whether they qualify for the Tier IV grants. For details, contact
the financial assistance coordinator at the phone numbers and address listed
above.<P>

<h3>Pennsylvania</h3><P>

Pennsylvania's Storage Tank Loan Fund provides loans at a 2 percent interest rate
to small, for-profit storage tank facility owners and operators for replacement
of leaking tanks, tank removals (if the business will continue to operate on the
site) and removals of a release or material affected by a release. Since April
1992, tank owners have submitted 74 loan applications. Fifty-seven have been
approved; 12 have been withdrawn or denied; and five are under review.<P>

The maximum loan provided by the fund is $50,000 or 75 percent of the entire
project cost, whichever is less. Loans must be repaid within 10 years. For
details, contact the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce, Division of Loans and
Technical Assistance, 490 Forum Building, Harrisburg, Pa. 17120; (717) 783-5046;
fax (717) 234-4560.<P>

<h3>Utah</h3><P>

The Utah Petroleum Storage Tank Loan Fund offers 3-percent fixed-rate loans for
upgrades, replacements and closures to tank owners who demonstrate compliance
with all state and federal UST laws, rules and regulations; have a certificate of
compliance; and have paid all fees, interest and penalties. No loans have been
made because the program is new.<P>

The maximum loan amount is 80 percent of approved project costs, $15,000 per tank
or $45,000, whichever is least. For more information, contact the Division of
Environmental Response and Remediation, UST Section, 168 North 1950 West, Salt
Lake City, Utah 84116; (801) 536-4100.<P>

<h3>Vermont</h3><P>

Vermont's Underground Storage Tank Loan Assistance Program gives zero interest
loans of as much as $40,000 to retail gasoline outlets that sell less than an
average of 20,000 gallons of gasoline per month and municipal facilities that
store petroleum products and have populations of less than 2,500. The program
covers replacement of motor fuel tanks that were in existence on or before Jan.
1, 1987.<P>

The state requires that all loans be guaranteed by a mortgage on real property or
equipment, and that they be repaid within 10 years. For details, contact the UST
Loan Program, Waste Management Division, Department of Environmental
Conservation, 103 South Main St., Waterbury, Vt.  05617-0404; (802) 241-3888.<P>

<title>IRS Issues Model Amendment For Veteran's Benefits Rules</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<P>
<h2>IRS Issues Model Amendment For Veteran's Benefits Rules</h2>
<P>
The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-188)  has corrected the tax code and ERISA so that employers may comply with the rules governing makeup contributions to the defined contribution plans of returning military veterans without violating qualified plan requirements.
</P>

<P>
Given these corrections, the IRS issued a revenue procedure on Oct. 7, 1996, which provides model language for amending plans to comply with the veteran's benefits rules in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA). 
</P>

<P>
Under USERRA, employees on leave for military service are entitled to receive defined contribution plan benefits -- and make up missed contributions -- for the length of the absence.  
</P>

<P>
But when USERRA took effect in October 1994, it was unclear how rules on contribution limits would apply to makeup contributions for veterans. For example, what if the makeup contributions, combined with the regular contributions the veteran is making to the plan, brings the employee over the annual contribution limit?
</P>

<P>
The Small Business Job Protection Act created a new section to the code, Section 414(u), to deal with these problems. The new section mandates that, when determining contribution limits, makeup contributions apply to the plan year(s) of absence, not the year(s) in which the contribution is actually made. 
</P>

<P>
The new revenue procedure (Rev. Proc. 96-49) provides model amendments for administrators who are modifying their plans to comply with the new section. These amendments may be completed without applying to the IRS or paying a user fee.
</P>

<P>
In general, plans are required to make such an amendment for plan years that begin on or after Jan. 1, 1998. However, plans are immediately required to comply with the USERRA rules. There rules went into effect in October 1994, and the two-year grace period bringing plans into compliance with them ended Oct. 13, 1996. 
</P>

<P>
The model language in the revenue procedure may be used by the following plans: master or prototype, regional prototype, volume submitter specimen, individually designed, and simplified employee pension plans (SEPs). 
</P>

<P>
In addition, plans must have received a favorable opinion, notification, advisory, ruling or determination letter that takes into account the requirements of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
</P>

<P>
Plan administrators who use the model language must also file Form 8837, "Notice of Adoption of Revenue Procedure Model Amendments (Rev. Proc. 96-49)."
</P>

<P>
Here is the model language: 
</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<P>
	<LI><B>Amendment 1:</B> "Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code." (This model amendment may be used to amend plans to provide for the requirements of USERRA and Code Section 414(u).)
	</P>

	<P>
	<LI><B>Amendment 2:</B> "Loan repayments will be suspended under this plan as permitted under section 414(u)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code." (This model amendment may be used to amend plans that provide for loans to participants, if the sponsor chooses to suspend loan repayments during a participant's military service.)
	</P>
</UL>

<P>
For an explanation of the new law affecting makeup contributions for veterans, see the "Special Report" in the October issue of <I>Current Developments</I>.

<title> Employer's Guide to the Fair Labor Standards Act </title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/person/wage/wagehead.gif" alt="Employer's Guide to the Fair Labor
Standards Act">
<P>
<h2>DOL Announces Schedule for Future FLSA Regulatory Action </h2>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) Nov. 29, 1996, announced its 12-month agenda for proposing and
finalizing changes to federal regulations. Among the projects that would most affect the Fair Labor
Standards Act (FLSA) and its application to the American work force are those targeting DOL rules
governing child labor and overtime and minimum wage exemptions for executive, administrative,
professional and outside sales employees.<P>

The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires federal entities to summarize their regulatory priorities for each
coming year and establish a timetable for acting on those plans. However, the priorities, which are
published twice a year in the <I>Federal Register</I>, do not provide specific details on proposed or final changes
to the rules.<P>

Moreover, federal agency target dates for completing the projects historically have been unreliable.
Frequently, a federal department or agency delays issuing a proposed or final rule for several months, and
sometimes even years.<P>

<H3>High Priority</H3><P>

Due to changes in technology in the work place and job content over the years, DOL plans to review its child
labor regulations. The department in its announcement notes that changes in the places children are
working, differing federal and state standards, and different views on how to best coordinate school and
work necessitate a re-examination of the regulatory matter.<P>

DOL invited comment on its child labor regulations in 1994 and stated it would base its proposed regulatory
alternatives on those comments. Possible changes to be considered include specific modifications or changes
to hazardous occupations orders and changes to the hours 14- and 15-year-olds are allowed to work.<P>

The department says it also will move forward with plans to "define and delimit the term 'any employee
employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity.'" This term applies to minimum
wage and overtime exemptions established under the FLSA regulations. In its notice, DOL explained the
complex history of these exemptions and the fact that salary levels used in applying the exemption tests
are outdated and offer little guidance to employers.<P>

The salary tests have not been updated since 1975 and recent lawsuits have created confusion as to what
constitutes compliance with the regulations' "salary basis" criteria. "Numerous comments and petitions
have been received in recent years from industry groups regarding the duties and responsibilities tests in
the regulations," DOL said.<P>

Though the regulations have been revised to deal with specific issues, they "are still in need of updating and
clarification," according to the department. DOL says that it plans to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking
on the provisions in September 1997, and will involve affected interest groups to develop alternatives to
the current regulations. It further says that "although legislative proposals have been introduced in the
Congress to address certain aspects of these regulations, the department will continue to pursue revisions
to the regulations as the appropriate response to the concerns raised."<P>

<H3>Other Issues Before DOL</H3><P>

DOL's semiannual agenda indicates that several other federal requirements related to the FLSA will likely be
reviewed in the coming 12 months. Among them are the following:<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI><I>Records to Be Kept by Employers Under the FLSA</I>. This proposal would simplify regulatory language and
streamline regulatory requirements to make them more easily understandable and reasonable. A notice of
proposed rulemaking should be issued by June, according to DOL.<P>

<LI><I>Minimum Wages in American Samoa</I>. Because the FLSA's minimum wage standards in American Samoa are
determined industry-by-industry and are delineated in separate portions of the regulations, the department
plans to combine and consolidate regulatory text as part of the Clinton administration's "Reinventing
Government" initiative. DOL planned to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking on the issue in November
1996, however, the department has yet to issue the proposal.<P>

<LI><I>Employment of Student-Learners, Apprentices, Learners, Messengers and Student Workers Under Section
14 of the FLSA</I>. This proposal falls under the Reinventing Government initiative as well, and would
consolidate and streamline the five separate parts of the <I>Code of Federal Regulations</I> that deal with this
topic to reduce duplication. A proposed rulemaking concerning the rule was due from the department in
November 1996, but no proposal has been issued.<P>

<LI><I>Miscellaneous Exemptions Under the FLSA.</I> This proposal would consolidate and streamline various FLSA
exemptions into a single set of regulations, including the provisions governing local delivery drivers and
helpers, FLSA applications to seamen, and radio and television personality overtime exemptions, among
others. A notice of proposed rulemaking is scheduled for September.<P>

<LI><I>Implementation of the 1996 Amendments to the FLSA</I>. This proposal would bring DOL's current regulations
into line with the amendments made by the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. These include
changes to provisions governing minimum wages, computer professionals and the youth "opportunity"
wage, among others. DOL scheduled a notice for proposed rulemaking for November 1996, however, the
department has yet to issue the proposal.<P>

<LI><I>Application of the FLSA to Domestic Service</I>. This proposal includes technical amendments to the
regulations regarding domestic service employees. The department planned a final action on this matter by
December 1996, but no action has been taken on the matter.<P>

<hr>

<H2>Physician-Hospital Relationships: <BR>
Managing the Delivery of Care </H2>
The theme at the recent Catholic Health Association's executive conference
in San Antonio, Texas, was clear: The predominant concern of both physicians
and hospitals should be how to manage patient care effectively across the
continuum of services. Speaker Bernadette Broccolo, a partner at Gardner,
Carton &amp; Douglas in Chicago, explained, &quot;As health care systems
move into the second and third generations of physician-hospital integration
models, they must move away from focusing only on structure to looking at
the operational aspects and how the relationships and finance will really
work.&quot; 
<H3>IPAs-an Attractive Model</H3>
Present-day barriers to viable integration efforts include an overemphasis
on autonomy and financial gain, a reluctance of the parties to realign economic
and financial aspects (such as compensation, contribution of resources,
and allocation of risks and return), and a lack of leadership or trust.
To attract physicians to integrated delivery systems, Dr. Henry Golembsky,
a senior consultant with APM Management in San Francisco, recommended several
practical services that these networks should consider offering: continued
access to patients and practice growth; practice autonomy, especially in
clinical decision making; help with managed care contracting and cost control;
participation in plans with high-quality panels and reasonable payment levels;
a fair means of dividing capitated revenues; and a collegial, professional
atmosphere (see Box #1). <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The most successful form of physician integration is really not a
form of hospital physician integration, including equity models, but independent
practice associations [IPAs],&quot; Ms. Broccolo pointed out. &quot;And
the reason physicians have moved toward IPAs is because they have focused
on managing the delivery of care-agreeing to unify case management protocols,
unify utilization review, [unify] patient satisfaction measures, [unify]
outcomes measures-focusing on their success as providers as opposed to investors.&quot;
<H3>Incentives Point to Quality</H3>
Dr. Golembsky expanded on Ms. Broccolo's comments. &quot;Financial incentives
must be designed to motivate the management and delivery of high-quality
patient care.&quot; It is also important for integrated systems to ensure
that the rewards and risks are significant enough to actually influence
behavior. Incentives must be aligned among all parties-primary care physicians,
specialists, hospitals, and other providers. &quot;If one makes money by
taking advantage of a partner, over the long term that relationship won't
be stable,&quot; he cautioned.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H4>Box #1: Community Characteristics That Influence Network Growth</H4>
<FONT SIZE="2">What factors influence the growth of the health care industry in specific
communities? The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, based in Princeton, New
Jersey, analyzed a number of sample U.S. communities in search of an answer.
The foundation's report noted differences in the nature of change and the
speed at which it traveled across these selected areas, with several key
factors affecting the movement toward managed care: 
<UL>
<LI>If large, well-managed, and well-capitalized organizations exist in
a segment of the market, that segment is likely to play an important role
in change. 
<LI>Hospital sectors may be relatively concentrated with large institutions
and strong management, which often integrate vertically into insurance endeavors
(e.g., starting their own health plan or negotiating an exclusive arrangement
with an insurer) and take the lead in integrating physicians into the network.
<LI>Organizational strength, as in large physician group practices, allows
the entity to contract with health plans on the basis of capitation and
lead the coordination of the delivery of care. 
<LI>Experience with managed care affects change and rapid growth: familiarity
with health maintenance organizations (HMOs) leads to the formation of network
and independent practice association (IPA)-model HMOs; lack of experience
leads to the establishment of preferred provider organizations (PPOs) and
less structured forms of managed care. 
<LI>The degree of state and local political commitment affects the ability
of safety net providers to offer access; other factors include a preference
or aversion of providers to profit entities, not-for-profit entities, or
organizations from outside the community, as well as how private employers
act within the market. </FONT>

<title> Court Rules on Double Recovery from Coordinated and Uncoordinated
 Insurance Policies</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/pen_ben/cobs/cobshead.gif" alt="Coordination of Benefits

<P>
<h2> Court Rules on Double Recovery from Coordinated and Uncoordinated Insurance
Policies</h2><P>

An insured may be compensated by both an uncoordinated no-fault automobile
insurance policy and a coordinated health insurance policy when the insured's
injuries result from a motor vehicle accident, a Michigan appellate court
ruled.<P>

In <i>Shanafelt v. Allstate Insurance Co.</i> 1996 Mich. App. LEXIS 214 (App. Ct.
Mich. 1996), Joyce Shanafelt severely injured her leg when she slipped and fell
on icy ground while getting into her car. Shanafelt had a health insurance policy
that contained a coordination of benefits provision and a no-fault automobile
insurance policy with Allstate that did not coordinate benefits with other
insurance.  <P>

Shanafelt sought no-fault benefits from Allstate. Michigan's no-fault automobile
insurance act provides that coverage is provided where "the injury was sustained
by a person while occupying, entering into or alighting from the [parked]
vehicle." The district ruled, and the appeals court agreed, that Shanafelt's
injury fit within the "entering into" a parked vehicle provision.<P>

Shanafelt's medical expenses were paid by her health insurer under the
coordinated insurance contract then in effect. In disputing the district court's
decision that it pay damages, Allstate argued that Shanafelt's expenses had
already been paid by the health insurer. <P>

Double recovery is prohibited under Michigan law. The coordinated benefits
provision of the health insurer, however, provided that "the coverage under those
plans will be coordinated so that up to, but no more than, 100 percent of any
eligible expenses will be paid for or provided by all such plans combined." The
Allstate policy, being uncoordinated, did not have language stating that 100
percent of an insured's expenses would be compensated by all the insurers.
However, the policy did not limit a plaintiff's right of recovery under multiple
insurance policies.<P>

Accordingly, the appeals court concluded that when an insured has an
uncoordinated no-fault insurance contract with an insurer that does not limit the
right to recover duplicate insurance coverage, the insured may be compensated
twice by uncoordinated and coordinated policies. <P>

<title> FLSA Amendments Revise Pay Rule for Certain Computer Professionals </title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/person/jobs/jobshead.gif" alt="Public Employer's Guide to FLSA Employee Classification"></center>

<h2>FLSA Amendments Revise Pay Rule for Certain Computer Professionals</h2>

<h3><i>Meanwhile, Comp Time Bill Makes Headway in Congress</i></h3>

A newly enacted amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) fixes at $27.63
the amount a computer professional must be paid per hour to qualify for
exemption from the act. The amendment was enacted as part of a law (H.R. 3448,
P.L. 104-188) that raises the minimum wage 90 cents per hour by Sept. 1,
1997.<P>

The amendment, which takes effect Oct. 1, 1996, adds to the FLSA a provision
establishing the minimum hourly wage a computer worker must receive to qualify
for exemption from the overtime protections of the act -- provided he or she
meets other duties requirements also set forth in the amendment. Currently, FLSA
implementing regulations, as set forth in the <i>Code of Federal Regulations</i>
(CFR), provide that exempt computer professionals be paid on a salary basis, or
be paid an hourly rate of at least 6.5 times the minimum wage (29 CFR
&#167;541.312). The new law removes the 6.5 multiplication factor from the rules
and establishes the flat $27.63 rate.<P>

The new amendment means that FLSA implementing regulations and the statute
provide two different minimum wage standards for exempt computer professionals
who are paid by the hour: $27.63, under the FLSA, and 6.5 times the increased
minimum wage, under the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) existing regulations.
According to a source at the DOL, employers should rely on the new amendment,
which supersedes the DOL's rules. "Basically," the DOL said, "this [amendment]
freezes the law as it is now." Therefore, employers will henceforth be held only
to the $27.63 hourly minimum, regardless of future increases in the minimum
wage.<P>

The source added that DOL's rules will be amended to reflect the change, but
could not guarantee when such an amendment would come.<P>

H.R. 3448, the bill containing the amendment, was approved by Congress Aug. 2
and signed by President Clinton Aug. 20. The law includes various tax reform
provisions, many geared toward helping small businesses.<P>

Under the law, the minimum wage will increase to $4.75 per hour effective Oct.
1, 1996. A second increase, to $5.15, will occur Sept. 1, 1997. The effective
dates were established by a House-Senate conference committee; earlier versions
of the bill would have set earlier dates for the two steps of the increase.<P>
In general, all employees covered by the FLSA must be paid at least the minimum
wage, which was set at $4.25 per hour in March 1991 (see &#182;101 of the
<i>Guide</i>).<P>

In addition to the changes for computer professionals, the new law contains a
measure revising the "tip credit system." Rather than paying "tipped" employees
50 percent of the minimum wage plus tips, employers may now pay workers $2.13
per hour plus tips (as under the previous system, the resulting amount must at
least equal the minimum wage). The law also enacts an "opportunity wage"
provision, which permits employers to pay new employees under 20 years old at a
rate of $4.25 per hour for their first 90 days of employment. Both provisions
are effective Oct. 1.<P>

<h3>Comp Time Bill Approved in House</h3>

A second FLSA-related bill (H.R. 2391), which would give private sector
employees the option to receive compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay,
passed the House July 30. The original version of the bill was introduced by
Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C., on Sept. 21, 1995.<P>

Pursuant to the FLSA, employers are required to pay their non-exempt employees
at a rate of time and one-half for all hours worked over 40 in a week.
Ballenger's bill would alter the FLSA to allow private employers to offer their
employees paid time off (or "comp time") in lieu of overtime pay, an option
currently enjoyed in the public sector.<P>

Employee use of comp time under the bill would be voluntary, and employers could
grant comp time only if provided for by a collective bargaining agreement (or
similar agreement made by an employee representative), or an agreement entered
into by the employee before work began.<P>

The bill also provides, among other things, that comp time granted as overtime
compensation would be given at a rate of time and one-half, the same rate at
which cash overtime is awarded. At the end of each calendar year (or other
pre-established 12-month period), an employer would have to give employees cash
in exchange for all unused comp time they had accrued.<P>

The bill also provides that an employee's entrance into a comp time agreement
could not be a "condition of employment." Under the legislation, employers could
not "directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten or coerce" employees into
agreeing to receive comp time rather than cash for overtime or using comp time
once it is accrued. Employers that violated these rules would be liable under
the legislation for monetary penalties.<P>

Under the bill, private sector employees could accrue up to 240 comp time hours;
pursuant to existing FLSA provisions, the accrual limit for public sector
employees engaged in public safety, emergency response or seasonal work would
remain at 480 hours. Employees who exceeded these limits would receive cash
overtime payments for the additional hours.<P>

Ballenger said in introducing the bill that offering employees a choice between
overtime pay and comp time would "help ease the burdens of juggling work and
personal responsibilities." But at a hearing on the bill held last December,
several Democrats on the House Workforce Protections Subcommittee expressed
concern that the legislation did not guarantee a sufficient degree of protection
for employees.<P>

Since its introduction, several provisions attempting to create increased worker
protections have been added to the bill. Nevertheless, opponents of the bill are
still concerned about employee rights, worrying, for instance, that the bill
would allow employers to force workers to accept comp time instead of overtime
pay.<P>

Ballenger's bill will next be considered by the Senate, although no date has yet
been set for this action.<P>

Other comp time proposals recently have been offered by President Clinton and
members of the Senate. The president discussed his version of a comp time
proposal at a June 24 conference held in Nashville, Tenn. Also, legislation
similar to Ballenger's bill (S. 1129) was introduced Aug. 7, 1995, in the Senate
by Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo. (see September 1995 <i>Current Developments,</i>
Page 8). The Ashcroft legislation was referred to the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee.

<html><title>Teaching Award Is Taxable, Tax Court Rules</title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<P>
<h2>Teaching Award Is Taxable, Tax Court Rules</h2>
<body>
In a recent decision, the U.S. Tax Court has confirmed the IRS' long-standing
position that employees may not exclude from income awards they receive for
outstanding performance. The case, <i>Gloria Ann House v. Commissioner</i> (T. C. Memo.
1996-311), involved an award for "religious, charitable, scientific, educational,
artistic, literary, or civic achievement." <P>

Gloria Ann House, a professor at Michigan's Wayne State University, received a
$3,000 cash award from the university for teaching excellence. The university
issued House a Form 1099-MISC for the $3,000, but it did not withhold taxes.
Although House reported the award on her federal income tax return, she
identified and treated it as nontaxable income.<P>

The court concluded that House's teaching award was taxable income because it did
not meet the Code Section 74(b)(3) requirement for exclusion. To exclude an
educational award under Section 74(b), the recipient must transfer it to a
government agency, charitable organization or other Code Section 170(c)(1)
entity. Because House did not transfer her award, the IRS determined that she
owed income tax and an accuracy-related penalty. The tax court agreed.<P>

House did not dispute the IRS' contention that her award did not fulfill the
Section 74(b)(3) requirement for exclusion. Instead, she argued that because the
university did not withhold employment taxes on the award, the award did not
constitute income and did not need to be reported as income. The tax court
rejected these arguments.<P>

Very few employee awards are excludable from income, and those that are must
satisfy strict requirements. Code Section 274(j) provides an exclusion for only
two kinds of employee achievement awards -- length-of-service and safety
achievements. (See &#182;530 through &#182;539 of the <i>Guide</i> for a discussion of
employee award programs.) <P>

<h2> Flex Plans and the Family and Medical Leave Act: Proposed Regulations
Eliminate Some Confusion</h2>
<body>

Administering Section 125 cafeteria plans can be complicated enough. But the
enactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), which requires the
maintenance and restoration of certain benefits for employees who take up to 12
weeks of FMLA leave, muddled it even further. To clarify the interaction between
the FMLA and Section 125, the Internal Revenue Service published proposed
regulations in the Dec. 21, 1995, <i>Federal Register</i> (60 FR 66229). <P>

The FMLA is enforced by the Department of Labor, which promulgated regulations in
January 1995 that, among other things, discussed employees' entitlement to
health-related benefits while on FMLA leave. (The FMLA is described in &#182;566
of the <i>Handbook</i>.) However, certain health benefits--such as health coverage and
medical flexible spending accounts (FSAs) under cafeteria plans, as well as COBRA
continuation coverage--are partially or solely under the IRS's purview. Since the
FMLA was enacted in 1993, the IRS has been wrestling with guidance on its side of
the equation. In 1994, the IRS released guidance on COBRA/FMLA issues; the new
proposed regulations address the impact of the FMLA on cafeteria plans. <P>

In general, the FMLA affects three broad areas of cafeteria plan
administration:<P>

<UL>
<LI>changes in family status;<P>

<LI>payment and cessation of cafeteria plan premiums; and<P>

<LI>medical FSAs.</UL><P>

The IRS's proposed regulations use a question-and-answer format, with a total of
eight questions, to clarify the FMLA's impact on various issues in these
areas.<P>

<h3>Plan Elections, Rights and Benefits</h3><P>

The proposed regulations clarify that an employee requesting leave under the FMLA
may revoke his or her existing cafeteria plan group health coverage election for
the remaining coverage period. Furthermore, if an employee loses health insurance
coverage while on FMLA-protected leave--for example, for nonpayment of the
policy's premium--the employer must reinstate the employee's coverage upon his or
her request. In addition, the reinstated coverage must apply under the same
conditions (including family and dependent coverage), with the same rights,
including the right to revoke or change elections, that applied prior to the
leave. However, the employee has no greater right to benefits for the remainder
of the plan year than an employee who has worked continuously during the plan
year, the IRS stated.<P>

If an employee elects to continue his or her cafeteria plan group health
coverage--including a medical FSA--during the FMLA-protected leave period, the
payment of premiums must continue without regard to the leave. Thus, the employee
would remain responsible for his or her premium contribution, if any, including
any amounts made pursuant to a salary reduction agreement. Similarly, an employer
would continue to contribute its share of the premiums during the leave
period.<P>

The proposed regulations also clarify that the FMLA requirements for cafeteria
plans do not apply to any non-health benefits, such as life insurance, provided
through the plan. Instead, an employer should rely on established policies for
provision of benefits during an employee's non-FMLA-protected leave period.<P>

Thus, an employee who takes FMLA leave presumably could revoke a flex plan
election regarding a non-health benefit to the same extent as employees on
non-FMLA leave--such as upon experiencing a change in family status, for example.
However, an employer may have to continue coverage of non-health benefits under a
flex plan during the FMLA leave to ensure that the employee can receive those
same benefits upon returning from leave. In that case, the employer may recover
the employee's share of the cost after the employee has returned from leave.<P>

<h3>Collecting Health Premiums</h3><P>

An employer can waive--on a nondiscriminatory basis--the requirement that
employees pay their share of premiums for health coverage during FMLA leave.
However, in cases where employees are required to pay for all or part of their
premiums, the IRS provides three payment options for employees who continue
health coverage--including medical FSAs--while on unpaid FMLA leave.<P>

<OL>
<LI>A pre-pay option, in which a cafeteria plan may <i>permit</i>--but not <i>require</i>--an
employee to pay, prior to FMLA leave, the amounts due for the leave period.
Contributions can be on a pre-tax salary reduction basis or an after-tax
basis.<P>

<LI>A pay-as-you-go option, in which employees may pay their share of premiums on
the same schedule as payments were made prior to FMLA leave, or under any other
payment schedule set forth in future FMLA regulations issued by the DOL.
Contributions generally can be made by the employee on an after-tax basis, but
they also can be made on a pre-tax basis from compensation due the employee
during the leave period (assuming that the Section 125 rules have been
satisfied). If an employee fails to make a scheduled payment, the employer may
make the payment and recoup it from the employee later. <P>

<LI>A catch-up option, where an employer recoups an employee's share of premiums
if the employee does not pay premiums during FMLA leave. However, the catch-up
option must be agreed upon in advance. Contributions can be made on a pre-tax
basis from any available compensation when the employee returns from FMLA leave,
but they can also be made on an after-tax basis.</UL><P>

However, the IRS noted three exceptions to these options: (1) the pre-pay option
cannot be the sole option offered (although it may be limited to employees on
FMLA leave); (2) the catch-up option can only be the sole option if it is also
offered to employees on unpaid non-FMLA leave as the sole payment option; and (3)
a cafeteria plan cannot offer a choice between the pre-pay or catch-up options
without also offering the pay-as-you-go option, if that option is also offered to
employees on unpaid non-FMLA leave.<P>

All three options include guidance on the collection of premiums on a pre- and
post-tax basis. Premium payments made on a pre-tax basis typically would arise if
an employee cashes out unused sick or vacation days. An employer should not
include such pre-tax payments in the employee's gross income if the employee
satisfies all other cafeteria plan requirements.<P>

The proposed regulations also outline procedures for payment of group health
premiums when an FMLA-protected leave period spans two cafeteria plan years. In
general, the regulations stress that any payment solution in this situation must
not enable the employee to defer compensation from one cafeteria plan year to the
next. Rather, the example provided in the regulations suggests that, to avoid
deferral of compensation, an employee should use some combination of the three
payment methods.<P>

<h3>Medical FSAs and the FMLA</h3><P>

Under the FMLA, employees who take FMLA leave must be permitted to continue
coverage under a medical FSA or revoke an existing FSA election for the remainder
of the coverage period. Furthermore, employees must be allowed to reinstate
their health FSAs once they return from FMLA leave on the same terms as prior to
taking the leave. However, the IRS noted that an employer cannot <i>force</i> a
returning employee whose coverage was terminated while on FMLA leave to reinstate
coverage.<P>

According to the IRS, as long as coverage is continued under FMLA leave, the full
amount of the elected coverage, minus any prior reimbursements, must be available
to the employee at all times, including the FMLA leave period. However, if an
employee's FSA terminates while the employee is on FMLA leave, he or she is not
entitled to receive reimbursements during that period. Furthermore, if that
employee is eventually reinstated, he or she cannot retroactively elect FSA
coverage.<P>

The IRS also noted that if a return from leave without pay constitutes a change
in family status under a cafeteria plan, an employee who returns from FMLA leave
can make a new medical FSA election for the remainder of the plan year.<P>

<h3>March 20 Comment Deadline</h3><P>

Written comments and requests for a public hearing are being received by the IRS
until March 20, 1996. Submissions should be sent to CC:DOM:CORP:R (EE-20-95),
Room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, P.O.B. 7604, Ben Franklin Station,
Washington, D.C. 20044. For more details about the regulations, call Catherine
Fuller at 202/622-6080. For information about written comments and the public
hearing, call Mike Slaughter at 202/622-8452.<P>

Employers may rely on the proposed FMLA regulations until the IRS issues final
regulations. The regulations are provided in this month's supplement to the
<i>Handbook</i>, in Appendix B.  <P>

<h2>Data Bank Finally Repealed</h2>
</P>

<P>
Legislation formally repealing a controversial federal rule that required employers to report health coverage data to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) was signed into law (Public Law No. 104-226) by President Clinton on Oct. 2.
</P>

<P>
Under the original requirement, which appeared in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, employers were required to report data to HCFA for calendar years beginning Jan. 1, 1994, and before Jan. 1, 1998. The first report was required to be filed no later than Feb. 28, 1995. The information was to have been used in a Medicare/Medicaid Data Bank to improve the identification of Medicare secondary payer cases and the ability to determine when employer plans should be the primary payer.  
</P>

<P>
Employers opposed the requirement from the outset, contending that it was administratively burdensome and expensive. A May 6, 1994, report by the U.S. General Accounting Office found that the data bank would have added significantly to employer recordkeeping, with no assurance that existing data on Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries would improve. When that report was published, HCFA recommended that Congress enact legislation delaying implementation of the data bank for 18 months.
</P>

<P>
In response to employer concerns, a conference agreement accompanying an FY 1995 appropriations bill funding the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)--HCFA's parent agency--stated that no funds were to be used to implement the data bank. In October 1994, HCFA announced that employers would not have to comply with the rule.
</P>

<P>
However, the requirement was technically still on the books, and several legislative efforts to repeal the rules were unsuccessful. As the 1996 reporting date drew closer, an HHS appropriations bill again did not include funding for the data bank, and HCFA informally stated that it would not enforce the rule.
</P>

<P>
The law's path to enactment was almost a year long. It was introduced in November 1995 as H.R. 2685 by Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., and passed the House in March. The Senate did not approve the measure until Sept. 25, 1996. Clinton signed the bill a week later, officially consigning the data bank to history.

<html> <title> How DOL's Wage &amp; Hour Division Conducts an Investigation</title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<IMG SRC="/tpg/person/file/filehead.gif" alt="FLSA Employee Exemption Handbook">
<P>
<h2> How DOL's Wage &amp; Hour Division Conducts an Investigation</h2>
<body>
<P>

The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) authorizes the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)
to investigate and gather data concerning wages, hours and other employment
practices; to enter and inspect an employer's premises and records without a
subpoena; and to question employees to determine whether any person has violated
the provisions of the act.<P>

Investigations may occur if DOL receives a complaint from an employee or some
other individual, an improper practice is found in a particular industry, or as
part of a general plan to review as many contractors' practices as possible.
Frequently, because DOL investigators are required to treat complaints
confidentially, an employer may not know the reason for an investigation.<P>

Generally, investigations will extend back two years. However, an investigation
may extend back three years if the DOL investigator has received prior approval
from a DOL area director and regional solicitor. In general, DOL investigations
will go back three years if the agency anticipates the examination will result in
litigation.<P>

Usually, DOL investigators will inform an employer of the time and date of an
investigation. In addition, an investigator will tell the employer what records
will be reviewed.<P>

<h3>Interviews With Employers, Employees</h3><P>

During the first interview with an employer, an investigator will outline for the
employer the scope of the investigation, including documents to be reviewed and
employees to be interviewed. Typically, an investigator reviews documents to
determine coverage of individual employees under the FLSA (e.g., whether they are
exempt from the laws' minimum wage and overtime provisions). Subsequently, the
investigator will usually interview employees to test the adequacy and accuracy
of records and help determine the validity of alleged violations. The interview
also gives employees the opportunity to point out other suspected violations.<P>

Interviews are conducted without the employer or its representative present, and
all information given by employees during the interview is kept confidential.
Conversely, the investigator will not give the employee any information obtained
from the investigator's review of the employer's records.<P>

When the fact-finding portion of the investigation is completed, the investigator
will hold a conference with the employer and inform the employer of the
investigation results. In cases where an employee has corrected past monetary
violations by full payment of back wages prior to an investigation, the
investigator will not treat these as violations. Nor will the investigator treat
minor bookkeeping errors as violations. However, if the investigator has found
FLSA violations, he or she will inform the employer of the steps needed to
correct the violations.<P>

During the conference with the employer, the investigator may initiate
negotiation of payment of back wages to employees, or attempt to encourage the
employer to comply with the FLSA. However, the conference will not be the
employer's last opportunity to negotiate with DOL should the employer choose not
to agree to back-wage payments at that time. In deciding whether to challenge
DOL's findings regarding back wages due, the employer should take into account
the strength of its legal position and the possibility of protracted and
expensive litigation should DOL decide to file a complaint against the
employer.<P>

<h3>Minimizing FLSA Liability</h3><P>

There are several ways an employer can minimize interruption caused by a DOL
investigation as well as reduce its FLSA liability.  The employer should
cooperate with the DOL investigator and provide the requested information and
employees for interviews. A cooperative attitude is likely to expedite the
investigation and produce a minimal amount of disturbance in the workplace. In
addition, the employer should not attempt to pressure or intimidate employees who
are to be interviewed by the DOL investigator, as the investigator is sure to ask
the employees if they have been pressured by their employer to give certain
answers.<P>

Also, the employer should ensure that it is in compliance with the FLSA before
being investigated by the DOL. Although almost every large employer makes some
inadvertent errors in overtime calculations or employee classifications, the
employer's liability will be greatly diminished if it is substantially in
compliance with the FLSA.<P>

Employers' payroll departments should understand how to compute overtime
calculations, and human resources departments should understand how to classify
employees under the FLSA and treat exempt employees to maintain their exempt
status. Further, employers should determine and review the exempt status of
employees on a regular basis in accordance with FLSA regulations. Hiring an
outside consultant to conduct classification studies and examine overtime and
leave policies can be beneficial. In addition, employers should listen carefully
to their employees' complaints and be sensitive to their dissatisfactions.
Resolving potential FLSA problems before an employee complains to DOL is an
employer's best solution to potential investigations.

Under newly proposed IRS regulations, retirement plan administrators would be able to accept an eligible rollover distribution without endangering their plans' qualified status even if the distribution turns out to be ineligible for rollover treatment -- as long as the administrators acted on a good faith belief that the rollover requirements were met. 
</P>

<P>
Existing rollover regulations do not specifically address the steps that administrators could take to ensure that they were acting in good faith; nor do the existing regulations address how to fix the problem that arises when an accepted rollover distribution turns out to be invalid.
</P>

<P>
The proposed regulations, published in the Sept. 19, 1996, <I>Federal Register</I>, allow a qualified plan to avoid disqualification due to an invalid rollover distribution as long as the plan administrator acted in good faith and distributed the invalid rollover amount, with earnings, to the participant within a reasonable period of time after discovering the error.
</P>

<P>
The IRS developed the proposed regulations to reassure plan administrators that accepting eligible rollovers should not jeopardize their plans' qualified status, even if the distributions turn out to be invalid. 
</P>

<P>
The IRS hopes the reduced risk will encourage more plans to accept rollovers, thereby increasing the portability of qualified pension plan benefits.
</P>

<P>
<H3>1995 Final Regulations</H3>
</P>

<P>
The original direct rollover regulations provided detailed rules governing direct rollover requirements and the ability of plan administrators to require reasonable assurances of the qualified status of any rollover distribution. The 1995 final regulations also provided that plans would not be disqualified if they accepted direct rollovers that later turned out to be invalid. However, the regulations only addressed the consequences arising from direct rollovers from other plans and not individual rollovers from participants (within 60 days of receiving distributions). Also, the original regulations did not give examples of the information that recipient plans could require from other plans or employees to prove that a distribution was eligible for rollover treatment.
</P>

<P>
<H3>Relief Expanded in Proposed Regulations</H3>
</P>

<P>
The proposed regulations provide many illustrative examples of the information that recipient plans could require from other plans and participants. For example, before accepting a direct rollover contribution, plans may require that participants submit a letter from the distributing plan's administrator indicating that the distributing plan had received a favorable IRS determination letter. 
</P>

<P>
In the case of a regular (not a direct) rollover contribution, a plan also could require a similar statement or a certification from the employee that the rollover requirements are met; a copy of the distribution statement could be required to accompany the prior plan's distribution check. Similar certifications may be required from conduit IRA distributions.
</P>

<P>
The proposed regulations also provide relief for plan administrators who determine that a rollover contribution previously accepted was invalid (because the distributing plan was later determined to be disqualified or because the distribution did not meet the requirements for a direct rollover distribution). In these cases, the recipient plan will retain its qualified status as long as it acted in good faith in accepting the rollover contribution and it distributes the invalid rollover amount, with earnings, as soon as practical after learning that the rollover contribution was invalid. Also, the invalid rollover does not have to be treated as an employee contribution for any nondiscrimination or other limitation testing purposes.
</P>

<P>
Although the proposed regulations do not establish any new legal principles, they do provide a great deal of certainty for plan administrators concerned about the consequences of taking rollovers that turn out to be invalid.
</P>

<h2>VCR Program Changes Expected; IRS Inundated With Submissions</h2>

<P>
<i>By Paul M. Hamburger</i><P>

We have been hearing a great deal lately about the IRS Voluntary Compliance
Resolution (VCR) Program. Now, with the IRS stepping up its plan audit activity,
plan sponsors will be giving more thought to finding their compliance errors
ahead of time and submitting them to the IRS for approval. This has proven to be
so true that the VCR Program is overwhelmed with submissions. <P>

The number of IRS submissions under the VCR Program has increased so dramatically
that the IRS has taken steps to speed up processing. Many of these steps are not
published in any formal guidance and will not be published soon -- they are known
to those who have made a number of current VCR submissions. Others will be
announced through changes in the IRS employee plans manual.<P>

<h3>Key Administrative Rules</h3><P>

Here are some of the key administrative rules that the IRS reviewers have
followed to expedite the VCR submission process:<P>
<UL>

<LI>The actual plan language related to the qualification defect does not always
have to be submitted. If it is a fairly common plan provision (like
nondiscrimination testing in a 401(k) plan or required minimum distribution
language), the IRS will accept the word of the party making the submission that
plan operation did not conform to the plan document.<P>

<LI>Detailed schedules and data concerning the dollar amounts of correction for
each affected individual are not necessary. Instead, the submission need only
describe the overall amount necessary to correct, the manner in which the
correction will be accomplished, and the number of employees affected.<P>

<LI>Some of the correction rules are being relaxed. For example, if an
overpayment of plan benefits has been made and the amounts are relatively small,
the IRS will not likely require that the plan pursue the overpaid participants.
<P>

<LI>In a defined benefit plan that has overpaid annuity payments, for example, if
a participant has been overpaid less than $20 per month, the IRS may consider
allowing the plan to continue making the overpayment rather than cause concern
among affected plan participants by reducing pension payments to the amount
required by the plan. This is particularly likely if the overpaid participants
are not highly compensated employees (HCEs).</UL><P>

In another important change, the IRS will not always require that plan sponsors
who have violated the Section 401(k) nondiscrimination tests in past years
contribute amounts to nonhighly compensated employees (NHCEs). According to VCR
published procedures (those in the standardized VCR Program), the IRS typically
requires that corrections for nondiscrimination testing require that
contributions be made for all NHCEs. That way, the HCEs will be allowed to keep
the otherwise discriminatory excess contributions that should have been refunded
in previous years.<P>

Sometimes, however, making contributions for all NHCEs can be very costly.
However, if the plan were allowed merely to refund, with interest, excess amounts
to HCEs, the funds could come from the plan and the cost of correction would be
significantly less to the employer. <P>

Current (but unpublished) VCR procedures allow for a return of excess
contributions to HCEs to solve the nondiscrimination testing problem only if the
cost of the corrective contribution exceeds five times the cost of distributions
to HCEs. <P>

Under a change that the IRS is considering for submissions made after Dec. 31,
1996, the employer could correct a nondiscrimination testing failure by
distributing $1 for every $1 contributed to the plan by the employer. In some
cases, this could be a significant savings in terms of corrective contributions.
But because the IRS does not intend to publish this rule soon, sponsors wishing
to submit their 401(k) plans to the VCR Program for correction of
nondiscrimination testing should check with the VCR Program reviewers before
filing to verify that a proposed method of correction is acceptable.<P>

<h3>Changes to the APRS</h3><P>

In addition to the VCR Program changes, the IRS is considering changing its
"administrative policy regarding sanctions" (APRS).<P>

The APRS is not a formal program. Rather, IRS auditors looking at plan
qualification errors will consider the severity of any problems they find. If the
qualification defect is <i>de minimis</i>, the IRS reviewer may choose to apply
the APRS and indicate that the problem will be overlooked.<P>

Plan sponsors who are under audit can ask the IRS to consider a defect (or
defects) for APRS treatment; however, the IRS has the final say. <P>

The biggest limitation of the APRS has been its restrictive eligibility
requirements. For example, if a plan has more than one type of defect in a single
year, it is technically not eligible for APRS treatment.<P>

The IRS has been considering changes for late 1996 or early 1997 to the APRS
program that will allow plan sponsors to self-correct a broad range of
qualification errors without having to obtain IRS approval. In this way, a
sponsor could correct errors for one plan year by the end of the next plan year
and retain its qualification without having to file with the IRS.<P>

<html> <title>Supreme Court Agrees to Hear QDRO Case</title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<P>
<h3><i>QDROs</i></h3><P>
<h2>Supreme Court Agrees to Hear QDRO Case</h2>
On Nov. 1, 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review an important QDRO
decision, <i>Boggs v. Boggs.</i> In the <i>Boggs </i>decision, the Fifth U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals held that ERISA did not preempt Louisiana's community
property law. <P>

As reported in the June 1996 issue of <i>Current Developments,</i> the Fifth
Circuit's decision created a split between its views and those expressed by the
Ninth Circuit in <i>Ablamis v. Roper </i>(937 F.2d 1450) as well as the
Department of Labor (see DOL Adv. Op. 90-46A, Dec. 4, 1990).<P>

In the case, the participant, Isaac Boggs, was married for 34 years to Dorothy
Boggs. Dorothy died and Isaac married Sandra Boggs, who survived Isaac when he
died. Isaac named Sandra as his surviving spouse for his pension benefits and she
was the named beneficiary of his life insurance benefits. Isaac and Dorothy's
children sought a portion of these benefits based on Louisiana's community
property law. Sandra argued that ERISA's anti-assignment rule preempted
application of state community property laws. <P>

The Fifth Circuit rejected this argument. The court also rejected the arguments
for ERISA preemption that were raised by the Department of Labor. <P>

Because of the clear split between the Fifth and Ninth Circuits on this point,
the U.S. Supreme Court decided to hear the case. Assuming that the Court follows
what seems to be the clear intent of Congress in passing the QDRO rules in the
first place, it is likely that it will find that ERISA does, in fact, preempt the
application of community property rules insofar as those rules affect the
disposition of qualified pension or profit sharing funds in the absence of a
QDRO.<P>

<h2>Supreme Court to Hear ERISA Preemption Case Next Year</h2>

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear an ERISA preemption case early next year
regarding a New York tax on health care services. The case will be heard between
January and April, said a court spokeswoman.<P>

In the case, <i>DeBuono v. NYSA-ILA Medical and Clinical Services Fund,</i> U.S.
Sup.Ct, No. 95-1594, (dated Oct. 15, 1996), the Court will decide whether a
state tax affecting two New York health care facilities operated by ERISA funds
is preempted by ERISA.<P>

The NYSA-ILA Fund is an ERISA-regulated multiemployer, labor management trust
fund established through collective bargaining agreements. It administers an
employee welfare benefit plan that provides medical, dental and other health
care services to ERISA plan participants. These benefits are provided through
three medical centers the fund operates--two in New York and one in New
Jersey.<P>

In 1991, New York enacted a health facility assessment (HFA) law, which imposed
a tax on gross receipts from patient care services and general operations of
in-state hospitals. The law, which was due to expire on April 1, 1992, was
amended to remain in force after that date.<P>

The fund filed suit in April 1992, claiming that ERISA preempted the tax as it
related to payments and contributions on health benefits. The suit also sought
restitution of the assessment taxes it had already paid.<P>

The state argued, however, that the HFA should not be preempted because it
covered ERISA plans by virtue of the plans' inclusion in a broader class of
entities subject to regulations. A federal district court in New York agreed,
saying the HFA was not preempted by ERISA because it has an "incidental impact
on ERISA plans."<P>

"The minimal tax imposed by the HFA is not great enough to pose a serious
economic threat to the plan, which might trigger preemption," the court said.
The amount of the assessment was six-tenths of one percent for the fund's
medical facilities.<P>

The Second Circuit, however, reversed the district court's decision, saying that
the HFA "depletes those assets earmarked for the provision of health care
benefits and, as a result, will cause the fund to reduce benefits provided
and/or charge beneficiaries more in the future for benefits received." (See
<i>NYSA-ILA Medical and Clinical Services Fund v. Axelrod,</i> 27 F.3d 823 (2nd
Cir. 1994).) That decision was ultimately vacated and remanded by the U.S.
Supreme Court because of the Court's ruling in <i>New York Conference of Blue
Cross vs. Travelers Ins.,</i> 131 L. Ed. 2d 695, (1995), which found that ERISA
does not preempt state laws which only have an indirect economic impact on ERISA
plans. However, the Second Circuit reaffirmed its original decision, saying it
was distinguished from <i>Travelers,</i> which involved a tax imposed on a third
party--insurance carriers--that provided health coverage. According to the
Second Circuit, the NYSA case involved no third party. Rather, the New York law
directly depleted the fund's assets and therefore has a direct affect on ERISA
plans. New York then requested the Supreme Court to review the case to determine
if the Second Circuit's opinion conflicts with the <i>Traveler's</i>
decision.<P>

<h3>Court Rejects AWP Case</h3>

The Supreme Court declined to review <i>CIGNA Healthplan of Louisiana v. State
of Louisiana,</i> 82 F. 3d 642 (5th Cir. 1996), in which the 5th Circuit Court
of Appeals ruled that Louisiana's any-willing-provider (AWP) law is preempted by
ERISA because it refers to and relates to ERISA plans.<P>

As a result of the court's ruling, the AWP law and other similar statutes cannot
require managed care groups to include any physician in their network who is
willing to abide by network terms and conditions.<P>

CIGNA Healthplan of Louisiana is a licensed HMO that provides prepaid coverage
for enrolled subscribers, including sponsors of ERISA plans. After excluding two
physicians from its network, CIGNA was notified by the attorney general's office
that a formal complaint had been filed charging them with violating the AWP law.
CIGNA, along with Connecticut General Life Insurance Co. (CGLIC), a licensed
health insurer that marketed CIGNA's network and used it in conjunction with
self-funded plans, sought a court judgment that the AWP statute was preempted by
ERISA.<P>

A lower court ruled in favor of CIGNA and CGLIC. The 5th Circuit affirmed that
decision. Before the 5th Circuit ruled in favor of CIGNA, the Supreme Court had
narrowed the scope of ERISA preemption in the <i>Travelers</i> case. The 5th
Circuit said the Supreme Court emphasized the appropriateness of preemption when
state statutes "mandate employee benefit structures or their administration." In
CIGNA's case, the appeals court said Louisiana's AWP law prohibits ERISA plans
from selecting a PPO that does not include any willing, licensed provider,
effectively requiring ERISA plans to buy benefits of a particular structure when
they contract with organizations like CIGNA and CGLIC.<P>

<h3>Court Rejects Two Other Cases</h3>

The Supreme Court declined to hear <i>Joseph Golden v. Kelsey-Hayes Co.,</i>
1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 539 (6th Cir. 1996), in which the 6th Circuit Court of
Appeals upheld a lower court's preliminary injunction against an employer,
reaffirming that, through rules of contract interpretation, courts will find
that rights accrue or vest under an agreement even if they are not explicitly
explained.<P>

The claim for vested benefits arose when a group of Kelsey-Hayes companies
reorganized and cut back on retiree benefits. There was a $500,000 per
beneficiary lifetime benefit cap, and increases to co-payments and annual
deductibles. In addition, a monthly payment that reimbursed Medicare premiums
for beneficiaries age 65 and older was eliminated. When plan participants and
beneficiaries challenged the cutbacks, the court said they would have to show
that both the employer and union intended to include a right to lifetime
benefits when they negotiated the collective bargaining agreements.<P>

The appeals court had ruled that evidence existed showing the plan sponsor's
intent to create vested rights to lifetime benefits through the collective
bargaining agreement and summary plan description.<P>

The Supreme Court also declined to hear <i>James E. Stiltner v. Beretta U.S.A.
Corp.,</i> 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 1562 (4th Cir. 1996) in which the 4th Circuit
ruled that an employer's threat to stop providing "gratuitous" health benefits
to persuade a plan participant to drop his disability benefits claims does not
discriminate under ERISA because the employer was not obligated to provide the
benefits.<P>

James Stiltner began working for Beretta U.S.A. in November 1988 as an
independent contractor. He was hired full-time in February 1989, at which time
he received a letter describing his medical and long-term disability benefits,
which excluded coverage for pre-existing conditions. Beretta changed disability
insurers in 1990, and the new insurers also had exclusions for pre-existing
conditions.<P>

Stiltner suffered a heart attack--he had a heart condition when he began working
for Beretta--and stopped working in June 1990. He applied for disability
benefits but was denied. In 1992, he demanded that Beretta pay him more than
$330,000 in long-term disability benefits, claiming entitlement under the
employment contract. Beretta refused, but offered to pay him $3,000 and continue
to pay his health premiums if he agreed to release the company from all
liability on his disability claim.<P>

Stiltner sued, claiming that the SPD failed to mention the preexisting condition
exclusion and that the employment letter listed disability benefits as an
employment contract, obligating Beretta to provide the benefits. He also
asserted discrimination under ERISA Section 510.<P>

The lower court ruled in Beretta's favor. An appeals court panel initially
reversed the lower court's decision, but the full appeals court heard the case
and ruled in favor of Beretta. Citing the National Labor Relations Act, the
court defined discrimination under ERISA Section 510 as "actions affecting the
employer-employee relationship" and ruled that revoking a gratuitous benefit
does not interfere with the employer-employee relationship. "A benefit is merely
gratuitous when there is a lack of consistency or regularity in providing the
benefit and when there is no official program under which the benefits are
provided," the court said, adding that, conversely, nongratuitous benefits are
provided regularly and consistently and are protected under ERISA Section 510.

<title>Health Benefits May Vest With Termination of LTD Plan Based on Employer
Promises, Appeals Court Rules</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/pen_ben/self/selfhead.gif" alt="Employer's Guide to Self-Insuring Health Benefits"></center>
<P>
<h2>Health Benefits May Vest With Termination of LTD Plan Based on Employer
Promises, Appeals Court Rules</h2>

Although a reservation of rights provision prevented vesting of health benefits,
an ambiguously worded exception to the nonvesting provision exposed an employer
to providing lifetime medical benefits for participants on long-term disability
(LTD), a federal appeals court ruled in <i>Leo W. Chiles v. Ceridian Corp.,</i> 1996
U.S. App. LEXIS 24450 (10th Cir. Sept. 19, 1996).<P>

An LTD plan's ambiguous summary plan description (SPD) prevails over clear
language in the master plan documents and reasonably could be read to provide
employer-paid medical benefits as long as participants are disabled, the court
said.<P>

The court said welfare benefits generally do not vest, but a contractual right
to lifetime health benefits may be created. Here, the SPD appeared to have made
an exception to the reservation of rights if the LTD plan was terminated. Plan
termination issues typically arise under retirement plans, not with group
welfare plans where there is scant legal guidance, the court noted.<P>

Nonetheless, the court found that the LTD plan had been terminated upon sale of
the employer and transfer of the LTD obligations to the buyer; however, the SPD
was unclear whether it meant to automatically vest health benefits upon the LTD
plan's termination. The appeals court sent the case back to the lower court for
a finding on that issue, and on whether the participants must show reliance on
the apparent promise of health benefits.<P>

<h3>Facts of the Case</h3>
Control Data provided an LTD plan through its subsidiary, Imprimis. Control Data
provided a range of ERISA benefits through a master plan document. The LTD
plan's SPD stated the company would pay premiums for all benefits until plan
participants were no longer eligible for disability coverage.<P>

Control Data sold Imprimis to Seagate Technology. As part of the sale, Seagate
agreed to administer the disabled participants' rights according to Control Data
plan terms. Control Data transferred assets to Seagate to cover projected
liabilities under the plan. Seagate then created a new LTD plan for the Control
Data plan participants. When the sale was pending, Control Data informed
employees that it would continue to pay for health coverage for those in the LTD
plan; however, three years later employees were required to pay part of the
premiums.<P>

Control Data's ERISA plans contained amendment and termination provisions, with
the SPD of each plan stating that Control Data reserved that the right to change
or discontinue the plan. The SPDs retained the employer's right to terminate the
plan "at any time." The LTD master plan's reservation of rights provided that
notwithstanding the termination of the LTD plan, a participant who is totally
disabled on the effective date of termination "shall continue to receive
benefits in accordance with" the plan terms. The SPD similarly stated that plan
participants who were totally disabled on the termination date will have
continued disability coverage as long as they remain totally disabled.<P>

Upon being told they would have to pay part of the health premiums, the former
employees claimed that: (1) the benefits had vested by plan terms; (2) even if
the health benefits had not vested upon qualification for LTD, the LTD plan
guaranteed the benefits would vest for all those disabled at the time the LTD
plan was terminated; and (3) the LTD plan did terminate when Control Data sold
Imprimis to Seagate.<P>

The appeals court noted that courts consistently have ruled that group welfare
benefits--unlike pension benefits--do not vest under ERISA unless the employer
contractually agrees to grant vested benefits.<P>

The 10th Circuit noted that courts have not ruled so consistently, though, when
there is an alleged promise of retiree lifetime medical benefits and a general
reservation of rights provision. But, the court continued, the weight of case
authority supports the approach that a general reservation of rights clause
allows the employer to retroactively change the medical benefits even in the
face of clear language promising company-paid lifetime benefits.<P>

Here, the court said, it was not faced with the problem of a general reservation
of rights clause. Rather, the reservation of rights provision explicitly related
to the LTD benefits and clearly retained Control Data's right to change the
benefits of all LTD plan participants. Thus, there was no general contractual
vesting of health benefits.<P>

However, the SPD did seem to create an exception to that reservation of rights
for when the plan terminated. Thus, the court had to determine whether the
Control Data LTD plan terminated when Imprimis was sold to Seagate, or was just
modified as Control Data and Seagate contended.<P>

<h3>Plan Had Terminated</h3>
After noting the lack of legal precedent regarding welfare plan termination, the
court found the Control Data LTD plan was terminated based on four factors: <P>
<OL>
<LI>new trustees were appointed to a replacement plan instituted by Seagate;<P>
<LI>Seagate became the administrator of the new plan;<P>
<LI>Control Data transferred money to fund the new plan; and<P>
<LI>after the transfer Seagate assumed all of Control Data's obligations for
disability plan participants.<P>
</OL>

The court further pointed out that essential features of an ERISA plan include a
procedure for establishing and carrying out a funding policy for the plan and
procedures for plan operation and administration. After Imprimis was sold, the
responsibilities for funding and administering disability benefits shifted to
the Seagate LTD Plan.<P>
<h3>SPD Prevails</h3>
Control Data and Seagate contended the LTD plan's documents could not support a
conclusion that the term "benefits" included payment of health premiums. But the
court said when plan documents and SPD conflict, the SPD prevails. The SPD
stated that the company would pay the premiums for all benefits for those on
LTD. Another part of the SPD clearly states that the company pays the health
care premiums for employees on short-term or long-term disability.<P>

The court concluded the former employees had successfully argued that a
reasonable person could find the SPD to include payment of health premiums as a
benefit to which persons on LTD status are entitled.<P>

This did not mean the former employees automatically became entitled to health
coverage, however. The court said the benefits are available only where
employees rely on an ambiguous or faulty SPD, or otherwise show prejudice from
the inconsistency between the SPD and the master plan document. The court left
the issue of reliance to the lower court.<P>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
In addition to underscoring the importance of clear and consistent document
drafting, the ruling applies law developed for retiree medical benefits to LTD
plans. In doing so, the court follows a line of reasoning that welfare benefits
do not vest statutorily upon retirement or upon LTD status, but may vest
contractually by virtue of employer and plan sponsor promises. In addition, the
court helps to fill a void of guidance on group welfare benefits terminations.
When a welfare benefits plan terminates, particularly a group health plan, after
the sale of a subsidiary can have implications for COBRA continuation of health
benefits, and who is obligated to provide the continued health coverage. There
also can be implications under Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) rules, such as
whether the disabled still have employee status, and which coverage is primary
and secondary.

<title> Adoption Assistance Finds Its Place in the Employee Benefits Spectrum</title>

<h2>Adoption Assistance Finds Its Place in the Employee Benefits Spectrum</h2>

<P>
Benefits costs, especially for group health insurance, are continuing to rise, forcing many employers to transfer some premium expenses to employees. To soften this blow and preserve employee morale, employers are looking for low-cost, highly visible additions to their basic benefits packages. What they are frequently hitting upon to answer some of their needs is the adoption assistance plan.
</P>

<P>
And Congress has recently lent its legislative power to strengthening this benefit. Under a provision in the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, employers can provide their employees with up to $5,000 per adoption, tax-free ($6,000 for special needs adoptions), beginning in January. (See the September 1996 issue of <I>Current Developments</I>, p. 3, for more information on the exclusion.)
</P>

<P>
The new exclusion has sparked employers' interest. But will it encourage more of them to launch adoption plans?
</P>

<P>
According to the National Adoption Center, approximately 100,000 families in the U.S. adopt each year. That number, when distributed across the nation's workforce, means a single employer will spend few of its total benefits dollars on adoption assistance.
</P>

<P>
But those few dollars can advance an employer's larger goals -- achieving benefits equity, improving industry competitiveness and strengthening employee loyalty and productivity. Employers that offer adoption assistance have discovered that, for a small investment, it delivers a high rate of return.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Adopting the Adoption Benefit</H3>
</P>

<P>
Steve Humerickhouse, founder of the Minneapolis-based Adoption Advocates, believes the number of plans will increase as employer awareness of the exclusion for adoption assistance spreads. "We're finding an immense number of employers looking at adoption assistance. The [recently enacted] exclusion could push them to actually implement the benefit," he says.
</P>

<P>
Helen Berry, senior benefits specialist at Lotus Development Corp., in Cambridge, Mass., also sees the benefit from this benefit. "If you're looking for a low-cost benefit that doesn't involve a lot of additional work, adoption assistance is a great way to go. Our employees really appreciate it and the price tag is right."
</P>

<P>
Adoption assistance programs are not new to the workplace; some employers have offered the benefit for many years. For example, Hallmark Cards Inc., in Kansas City, Mo., instituted adoption assistance benefits more than 15 years ago, according to Tresia Franklin, manager of benefits administration. "We're a very family-oriented company," she says.
</P>

<P>
Other companies have only recently introduced adoption benefits. Bell Atlantic Corp., a mid-Atlantic telecommunications provider, implemented its adoption assistance program as part of a union contract last July. "It's very new, but so far we've had about 60 inquiries and have helped about 5 employees to locate adoption agencies," says Joan Rasmussen, company spokesperson for Bell Atlantic.
</P>

<P>
As of 1995, only 23 percent of major U.S. employers offered adoption assistance benefits, according to a survey by Hewitt Associates. But, as employers search for cost-effective benefits, this percentage is likely to grow.
</P>

<P>
Adoption assistance benefits can include any combination of three major components -- financial assistance, paid or unpaid leave and resource and referral services. The most successful packages include each component in some form.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Achieving Benefits Equity For All Parents</H3>
</P>

<P>
Both employers and adoption assistance advocates usually cite benefits equity as the most important reason why employers should offer adoption benefits. "Most employers offer benefits for employees that have children born to them. The same rationale should apply to adoptive families because they're doing the same thing -- building stable families," says Patrick Purtill, director of government relations for the National Council for Adoption, in Washington, D.C.
</P>

<P>
When Suzanne Camp, adoption benefits coordinator at the National Adoption Center, in Philadelphia, speaks with employer groups, she asks them to "think about the maternity benefits you offer -- what is the relative cost of the insurance providing those benefits." She then explains to employers that adoptive parents should receive similar benefits.
</P>

<P>
Companies are beginning to consider this perspective that benefits equity matters to all employees. Employers that offer maternity benefits under the umbrella of their group health plans are now recognizing that some of their employees build families through adoption and should receive comparable benefits to ease the transition.
</P>

<P>
"We realize there are costs involved with adoptions. We wanted to make this benefit available to help employees," says Mary Lou Simmermacher,  a press relations representative with Hewlett-Packard Co., in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>

<P>
For employees at Eastman Kodak Co., in Rochester, N.Y., adoption assistance is "a reasonable benefit," says Paul Allen, manager of corporate media relations. "Parents that have to go the adoption route to form a family are not able to take advantage of the medical coverage available through maternity benefits. Adoption assistance rounds out our benefits program."
</P>

<P>
Lotus instituted adoption assistance benefits more than five years ago to "even the score" between birth and adopting parents. "We saw that our female employees received medical coverage and maternity leave," says Berry. "But we couldn't offer that to adopting parents under the existing benefits program. Adoption assistance gives those parents time to be with their child."
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>A Low-Cost Benefit</H3>
</P>

<P>
The low cost of adoption assistance benefits appeals to many employers. Because utilization rates hover between 1/2 percent and 2 percent of the employee population, even employers that provide the maximum $5,000 excludable benefit will spend relatively little for adoption assistance, accounting for a small percentage of total benefits dollars. For that minimal investment, Camp says, many employers feel "they're doing something good for their community."
</P>

<P>
Employers can reimburse many types of expenses -- adoption agency fees, legal fees and court costs, medical expenses of the child prior to adoption, temporary foster care expenses, travel and lodging expenses, and in cases of international adoption, immigration and naturalization fees, and immunization and translation fees.
</P>

<P>
Adoptions, even when arranged through nonprofit agencies, are expensive. According to Purtill, domestic adoption costs can average between $14,000 and $22,000. International adoptions, because they "involve more work and travel to extremely expensive areas like Moscow and Beijing," will cost even more, he adds.
</P>

<P>
Adoptive families finance these expenses just about any way they can. Families will tap personal savings, credit cards and family loans. "A lot of people are forced to take out second mortgages," Purtill says.
</P>

<P>
The reimbursement caps used by companies interviewed for this article range from $2,000 to $5,000. According to the 1995 Hewitt report, the reimbursement caps of about 79 percent of employers surveyed fell within this same range.
</P>

<P>
For example, Lotus reimburses up to $2,500 per finalized adoption for eligible expenses, including agency, placement and legal fees, medical examinations and temporary foster care.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Parental Leave Includes Parents Who Adopt</H3>
</P>

<P>
Many employers also have applied the concept of benefits equity to their leave policies for adopting parents. Adopting parents often need leave time for reasons beyond welcoming a child into the home. Adoption agency home studies, visits with their children while in temporary foster care, or travel to another region or country all require leave. A flexible adoption or parental leave policy that accommodates a wide range of needs can help adopting parents.
</P>

<P>
Hewlett-Packard employees can request up to one year of unpaid leave, even though most do not use the full year.
</P>

<P>
At Lotus, adopting parents receive up to 20 days of paid parental leave after their first year with the company, accrued at 2.5 days per month. They can use this paid leave as part of their leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Resource and Referral Services Give Employees A Head Start</H3>
</P>

<P>
Resource and referral services are a critical -- and relatively inexpensive -- benefit. For employees exploring the adoption option, the information gathering process can require many time-consuming telephone calls -- often only possible during working hours. Resource and referral services can streamline this process, benefiting both employers and employees. And adoption services can be incorporated into an employer's existing "work/life" program.
</P>

<P>
Bell Atlantic, Hewlett-Packard and Lotus use outside service providers. Hewlett-Packard's range of services includes practical information on the financing of adoptions, adoption options, local resources, referrals to reputable adoption agencies, and help coordinating it all.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Getting the Word Out</H3>
</P>

<P>
An adoption assistance program's success -- from achieving an almost hassle-free administration to using the benefit to communicate company culture and values -- depends on how an employer communicates the benefit's availability to its workforce.
</P>

<P>
Some common ways to communicate include paycheck stuffers, information brochures, work site seminars and benefits fairs. Almost all employers include information in their benefits handbooks. Many also publish announcements or news stories in their company newsletters.
</P>

<P>
At Amgen Inc., a biotechnology company in Thousand Oaks, Calif., every new employee is given this information as part of the new hire orientation, says Lynne Connell, senior corporate communications specialist. Amgen also uses emerging technology -- its company "Intranet" (a sort of internal Internet accessible only to employees) -- to make benefits information available at all times.
</P>

<P>
Lotus uses its computing and software expertise to inform employees of their benefits options. All benefits materials, including adoption assistance information, are available online, using the company's own Notes program.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Interested, But Wondering How to Start?</H3>
</P>

<P>
Introducing a new employee benefit takes planning. One resource that can get you started is the National Adoption Center's Adoption and the Workplace initiative. The center, along with the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, a public charity established by Dave Thomas, founder of the Wendy's chain of restaurants, has developed a guide to help employers set up adoption assistance plans.
</P>

<P>
The <I>Employer's Guide to Adoption Benefits</I> provides answers to many questions, as well as a model implementation plan that employers can adapt to their needs.
</P>

<P>
In addition, the National Adoption Center, with funding from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, has established a national database of employers offering adoption assistance benefits. The database collects information on benefit eligibility rules, financial reimbursement caps, paid and unpaid leave policies and resource and referral services. Employers also can request adoption assistance benchmarking studies to help them develop industry-competitive programs.
</P>

<P>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT><CENTER>Adoption Assistance Benefits Promote Industry Competitiveness</CENTER></H4>
</P>

<FONT SIZE="2"><P>
Using employee benefits to maintain and strengthen industry competitiveness has become an increasingly necessary strategy for employers. As more and more employees change jobs more frequently, the quality of an employer's benefits package has become crucial to recruiting and retaining employees.
</P>

<P>
In the 1990s, employers are developing "work/life" benefit programs to improve their ability to compete for skilled employees. And many are learning that adoption assistance can play an integral role in that recruitment process.
</P>

<P>
The availability of adoption assistance enhances an employer's image as an industry leader, setting the pace for benefits innovation. According to Suzanne Camp, adoption benefits coordinator at the National Adoption Center, many employers seek information about the benefits programs provided by others in their industries. "These employers want the best benefits programs out there," Camp says. "And more and more, that means offering adoption benefits."
Bell Atlantic analyzes what benefits other employers offer as a routine practice. "We review benefits trends to learn what we need to do to remain competitive in the marketplace," says company spokesperson Joan Rasmussen. "It's a very competitive industry for us. Employees are no longer spending as much time with one company. Benefits are one factor that help us attract a qualified workforce."
</P>

<P>
The high visibility of adoption assistance benefits also demonstrates an employer's commitment to supporting families and the larger communities in which they do business. That commitment to integrating work and family more smoothly draws skilled workers to an employer -- and can keep them there.
</P>

<P>
Paul Allen, manager of corporate media relations at Eastman Kodak, says that, although adoption benefits represent only one component of the company's benefits program, it's one that "helps attract good employees. It fills a benefits niche and keeps us competitive."
</P>

<P>
A cutting-edge benefits program also can promote a company's competitiveness by improving its productivity. When an employer communicates through its benefits program that what's good for its workers is good for business, employee loyalty thrives, boosting productivity. And the heightened morale doesn't just come from employees who use a particular benefit, such as adoption assistance. It permeates the company's culture. Tresia Franklin, manager of benefits administration at Hallmark Cards, says, "Adoption benefits are a good morale booster even for people who don't use it."
</P>

<P>
"Really trying to manage work-life. That's what it's all about," explains Helen Berry, senior benefits specialist at Lotus. "It's fast-paced and stressful here; we work hard. But people know it's a caring environment because of our benefits -- adoption assistance, spousal equivalent benefits, wellness programs, paid parenting leave. People appreciate it and it shows."

<html> <title>New HCE Definition Eases Nondiscrimination Testing -- But Not for Flex
Plans</title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/pen_ben/flex/flexhead.gif" alt="Flex Plan

<P>
<h2>New HCE Definition Eases Nondiscrimination Testing -- But Not for Flex
Plans</h2>
The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, enacted in August, includes a host
of long-awaited measures that will simplify the complex nondiscrimination tests
that apply to retirement plans and certain types of welfare plans. That's good
news for sponsors of retirement plans, including defined benefit pension plans
and various forms of defined contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans.<P>

There's bad news for flex plan sponsors, however: The new, simplified rules do
not apply to Section 125 plans. <P>

Among the new rules is a simplified definition of a highly compensated employee
(HCE) as specified by Code Section 414(q). This HCE definition is a critical
element of many of the different nondiscrimination tests that must be applied to
various types of employee benefit plans.<P>

Unfortunately, the new HCE definition will not affect benefits that use
definitions of highly paid employees other than the one spelled out in Code
Section 414(q). This category of benefits includes Section 125 plans. Under
Section 125, cafeteria plans -- but not the benefits provided through these plans
-- must use an imprecise definition of a "highly compensated participant" for
purposes of the benefits/eligibility test (see &#182;710) and a "key
employee" standard for purposes of the concentration test (see &#182;720).
<P>

Section 125 plans are not the only plans that are unable to take advantage of the
new, simplified HCE definition:<P>
<UL><P>
<LI>self-insured health plans use a "highly compensated individual" definition
under Section 105 (see &#182;741); and <P>
<LI>under Code Section 79, group term life insurance plans use the same "key
employee" definition used in the Section 125 concentration test (see
&#182;742). </UL><P>
Of the benefits discussed in the <i>Handbook, </i>in fact, the new, simplified
definition of an HCE under Section 414(q) will affect only Section 129 dependent
care assistance plans (see &#182;743).<P>

<H2>Allocating Medicare Revenues Among Providers</H3>
<H3>by C. Keith Powell, Esq.</H3>
One of the crucial questions a managed care organization (MCO) with a Medicare
risk contract must answer is how to allocate its revenues across provider
categories. Many MCOs try to start the allocation process by finding out
what the national distributions of provider payments are and fitting them
into their particular risk contract.<BR>
<BR>
MCOs should be aware that cost-based distributions across different providers
are extremely difficult to construct with great accuracy for a local area,
and even if such a distribution can be built it is generally of little use
in structuring revenue flows under the Medicare risk contract.<BR>
<BR>
The following are practical guidelines that apply to national provider cost
distributions as well as the limitations inherent in any attempt to use
national distributions to structure revenue flows under the MCO's individual,
geographically specific risk contract.<BR>
<BR>
<B>National Versus Local Costs</B><BR>
<BR>
For any provider category, certain parts of the country will have high costs
and other parts low costs. Unfortunately, areas of the country that have
high costs for one provider class (such as hospitals) do not necessarily
have high costs for other providers. For example, in a given area, hospital
costs may be 50 percent higher than the national average while physician
costs may be 20 percent lower than average. In such a case, there is no
way that an MCO could safely assume that its percentage distribution of
costs could be based on the national average. While the disparity between
national and local costs is most evident in extreme cases, it is present
in all cases. <BR>
<BR>
<B>All Providers Are Not Equal</B><BR>
<BR>
Even if an MCO can learn the average cost level in an area for a particular
class of providers, it should be aware that costs can vary considerably
within that class. For instance, one large surgical group can have much
higher costs than another in the same area.<BR>
<BR>
Estimating costs among various local providers of the same class can grow
even more complex when the fact that one provider will generally be much
more willing than another to offer a large discount to the MCO to get its
business is taken into consideration.<BR>
<BR>
Because of these two factors, even if the cost level of a given provider
group can be determined, such information does not predict the &quot;proper&quot;
amount of revenue to pay to that provider because it may be possible to
negotiate an excellent discount.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Statutory and Market Issues</B><BR>
<BR>
Under a typical Medicare risk contract there is much less money available
to providers in the aggregate than provider cost data would indicate, and
some classes of providers are more willing than others to absorb these shortfalls.
This makes cost distributions less reliable for allocating Medicare risk
contract revenues.<BR>
<BR>
MCOs should keep in mind that they receive only 95 percent of the average
cost under a risk contract, and the MCO typically takes 7.5 percent to 10
percent out of that reimbursement for administrative costs. However, the
Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) includes only about 0.25 percent
for Part A and 2.0 percent for Part B administration (the government's actual
cost for the administrative work that will be passed on to the MCO). <BR>
<BR>
According to recently published statistics, most MCO risk contracts offer
additional health benefits without charging enrollees for these benefits.
For instance, nearly half the MCOs offering prescription drug benefits do
not charge enrollee premiums. Offering these additional benefits at no charge
to the enrollee results in an addition of $100 per member per month in health
benefits for which no revenue is received. Thus, overall, the amount of
money available to providers, after the MCO deducts its administrative overhead,
is often only about 70 percent or less of the cost of those services.<BR>
<BR>
In a setting in which only 70 percent of the cost equivalent money is available,
some providers are much more able to control costs than others. Also some
providers will want the additional business more than others - a decision
that relates to such issues as marginal cost, supply of those providers,
and acceptance of managed care concepts. However, other providers will not
be open to discounting. For instance, many hospitals and certain physicians
may take 50 percent cuts to become exclusive providers, vendors of prescription
drugs will not. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Revenue Distribution Examples</B><BR>
<BR>
While MCOs should keep in mind the caveats outlined above, they may find
it useful to see estimates of provider costs for the aged in 1996 based
on HCFA data.<BR>

cannot easily break out the costs of group practice prepayment plans (GPPPs)

GPPP costs over the remaining provider calculation in proportion to the
given costs of the other categories. For instance, if hospitals constitute

<HR SIZE="4">Note that Tables 1 and 2 show only the costs for the Medicare
program benefits, and do not include the cost of supplemental benefits added
to almost all Medicare risk contract packages. The HCFA numbers given for
the cost of Part A and Part B deductibles, and copayments are, at best,
national numbers, and do not reflect area cost differences - a grave problem
for the value of Part B coinsurance and a serious concern for Part A values.

<B>Trends Over Time</B><BR>
<BR>
HCFA data, over time, offers MCOs insight into patterns of change in cost
distribution, although there is no guarantee that such trends will continue
or apply to a given set of providers.<BR>
<BR>
The overall portion of money going to hospitals since the Medicare program
began has not changed much, however, there has been a strong shift from
the inpatient hospital setting to outpatient care. In contrast, the portion
of money going to home health agencies has soared in the past decade. Recently,
skilled nursing facility costs have reversed historic declines, and appear
to be rising.<BR>

<html> <HEAD><TITLE> Draft Interim Policy Promotes Stormwater Controls, Monitoring</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<body background="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif>
<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/enviro/strm/strmhead.gif" alt="Stormwater Permit
Manual"></center></IMG><P>



<H2> Draft Interim Policy Promotes Stormwater Controls, Monitoring</H2>

<body>

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends using best management

practices (BMPs) instead of numeric water-quality based effluent limits in

stormwater permits, according to a May 3 draft of an interim permitting strategy

for regulating industrial and municipal discharges.<p>

The interim approach calls for BMPs in first-round stormwater permits, and

expanded or better-tailored BMPs in subsequent permits, according to a draft

policy document from EPA's Office of Water. In a draft question and answer

document explaining the interim policy, EPA said if BMPs alone are demonstrated

to provide adequate water quality protection, additional controls are not

necessary. However, in cases where data exist to develop more specific

requirements for meeting water quality standards, those requirements would be

incorporated into permits, the policy states.<p>

The policy would apply to stormwater discharges associated with industrial

activity and discharges from municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s). It

would not apply to industrial stormwater discharges regulated under an effluent

limitation guideline for which technology-based numeric effluent limits already

have been derived. EPA in March circulated a draft policy document saying that

numeric effluent limits are not appropriate for MS4 permits (see <i>Bulletin</i>, April

1996, p. 1).<p>

The policy evolved in response to questions about whether effluent limits--numeric

or otherwise--are suitable for National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System

(NPDES) stormwater permits, and whether numeric limits can be enforced. "Due to

the nature of stormwater discharges, and the typical lack of information

necessary to develop numeric effluent limits, EPA recommends an interim

permitting approach be used for NPDES stormwater permits," the policy states. <p>

"There has been a lot of anxiety over this because EPA has not spoken about

water-quality based effluent standards," said John Whitescarver, president of the

National Stormwater Center in Washington. "We all know what the rules say--that

the standards apply to all NPDES permits. But with this policy, EPA has done a

good job of explaining the fact that the standards cannot be derived properly to

be put into stormwater permits," Whitescarver said. <p>

The interim permitting approach would apply to EPA only, although the agency said

it would encourage NPDES states to adopt similar policies for state stormwater

permits. But Whitescarver said he believes the policy would prevent

NPDES-delegated states from enforcing numeric effluent limits in their existing

permits. "EPA has never really pushed it, and this removes the threat of

enforcement by states," he said. <p>

The policy clarifies that EPA is aware of the lack of information to justify

numeric limits in stormwater permits, and calls for a monitoring program to be

used to gather additional data, which could be used to establish non-numeric

limits in the form of BMPs.<p>

<h3>Monitoring Procedures</h3><p>

To aid in gathering more information about stormwater discharges, permits should

include some combination of monitoring procedures, such as ambient monitoring,

receiving water assessment or discharge monitoring, the draft policy notes.

According to the draft, the frequency and types of monitoring needed will vary

depending on individual circumstances.<p>

Monitoring is typically performed for two reasons: to identify and characterize

stormwater contaminants found in industrial runoff, and to assess whether

stormwater controls implemented under a pollution prevention plan are reducing

the contaminants. This often involves end-of-pipe chemical-specific monitoring,

EPA said.<p>

<h3>Physical v. Chemical</h3><p>

Although EPA has defined a methodology for deriving numeric water-quality based

effluent limits, that policy is really designed for continuous wastewater

discharges at low flow conditions, not for intermittent wet weather discharges

during high flow conditions, EPA said. "Low flow and continuous flow are two

things you don't have in storm events," Whitescarver said. "For those two

reasons, numeric effluent limits don't belong in stormwater permits," he said.<p>

In some cases, the water quality impacts of storm-water discharges may be more

closely related to physical effects--like stream bank erosion, streambed scouring,

extreme temperature variations or sediment--than to the chemical pollutants

present in the discharge, EPA said. However, the agency admitted that it is

difficult and expensive to accurately measure the effects of specific BMPs or the

overall effect of a complex stormwater control plan on the achievement of

specific water quality standards.<p>

"This issue of high velocity flows that cause erosion is of great interest,"

Whitescarver said. "In the policy, EPA talks a lot about the physical problems

that can occur with episodic storm events. How do you fix that? How do you

prevent high velocity flows from causing sediment discharges? Normally you have

to use structural controls." Whitescarver said he sees EPA's thinking on water

quality standards moving away from chemical constituents and toward physical

constituents, "and by that I mean erosion, layering of sediment, scouring and the

like." <p>

<h3>Research Programs</h3><p>

The agency said it is working now with the Water Environment Research Foundation

and the American Society of Civil Engineers to determine which BMPs are most

effective under different circumstances. "The results of this research will

provide permitting authorities and permittees with information about how to

evaluate the effectiveness of different kinds of BMPs in different circumstances,

and to select the most appropriate controls to achieve water quality objectives,"

EPA said. <p>

In addition, EPA is sponsoring research by the Watershed Management Institute and

other organizations over the next two to four years that will examine how well

different BMPs protect receiving water quality. <p>

<h3>What Lies Ahead</h3><p>

As Whitescarver pointed out, EPA is calling its new policy an "interim approach"

to permitting. "That means there's another one coming, a final policy, and that

could be something very different," he said. A final policy would take years to

develop, he said. "EPA would need to develop the methodology, collect the data,

and do the engineering to figure out what it all means. Clearly this is four or

five years down the road," he said. <p>

The draft policy stressed that the Clean Water Act does not require EPA to

subject industrial and municipal permittees to numeric water-quality based

effluent limits to attain water quality standards. EPA said it has interpreted

the statute to allow BMPs in lieu of numeric standards. <i>NRDC v. Costle</i>  held

that EPA did not have to establish numeric effluent limits if the limits were not

feasible (568 F.2d 1369 (D.C. Cir. 1977)). Further, although there is no formal

guidance on the subject, EPA has defended use of BMPs as a substitute for numeric

limits in other litigation involving stormwater discharges.<p>

<title>Employee Relocation Programs Offer Benefits For Children, Parents and Spouses</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/pen_ben/perk/perkhead.gif" alt=" Employer's Guide to Fringe Benefit Rules"></center>
<P>
<h2>Employee Relocation Programs Offer Benefits For Children, Parents and Spouses</h2>

<P>
Two economic trends are having a profound influence on employer relocation policies today: the widespread belt-tightening corporate America has undertaken in recent years and the growing number of women in the workforce. 
</P>

<P>
Together, these trends have changed relocation policies to reflect employers' more solid commitment to work/life programs.
</P>

<P>
A survey of 191 organizations released last month by the Employer Relocation Council (ERC) shows how powerful these trends have become. Cris Collie, executive vice president of ERC in Washington, D.C., sees the industry "focusing increasingly on work-family issues, on how we should address everything that comes into play" when employees relocate.
</P>

<P>
Through the 1960s, 1970s and even the 1980s, Collie says, most transfers were connected either to employee promotion or development. Dad, the typical transferred employee, would announce the transfer and Mom and the kids would pack up and head toward upward mobility. But that scenario, he says, has "gone the way of the black and white television." 
</P>

<P>
In the 1990s, most transfers represent lateral career moves for employees, springing from company mergers, cost-cutting strategies and corporate reengineering. An employer reorganizes and needs an employee's specialized skills in another division. A company downsizes and can offer a valued employee continuing employment only at another branch across the country. In recent years, an employer's invitation to an employee to relocate has more frequently become an alternative to the pink slip.
</P>

<P>
Despite the tight job market for many middle managers -- the group most frequently relocated, according to the ERC survey -- employees rarely just accept a transfer. Instead, they more frequently ask employers, "What about my family? My spouse? My kids? My parents?" Employers are answering with comprehensive relocation policies, Collie explains, that "serve as tools to persuade the employee to accept the transfer and then to make that transfer work."
</P>

<P>
Today, a transfer's success or a failure closely correlates with the effort an employer expends involving and assisting the employee's family -- especially the "trailing" spouse. And more and more relocation policy-makers recognize that employees worrying about their unemployed and unhappy spouses, their unreliable child care and their aging parents cannot be focused and productive in their new jobs. So many companies have added a myriad of family assistance components to their relocation programs, including child care, elder care and career assistance for spouses.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Child Care and Schooling</H3>
</P>

<P>
The ERC survey reports that 25 percent of responding companies have established child care and schooling assistance policies for relocating employees. Another 10 percent provide similar services according to employee demand.
</P>

<P>
Almost every employer responding to ERC's survey indicated that the location and quality of schools in the new work area concern their relocating employees. Fifty percent of employers also report employee worries about the availability of reliable and affordable child care services in the new location.
</P>

<P>
Some employers provide employees with a simple list of child care facilities and schools convenient to the new home. Others conduct workshops, counsel parents on children's needs and fears during the move, and even reimburse babysitting costs to allow the trailing spouse to seek employment.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Elder Care</H3>
</P>

<P>
Collie also says that the importance of elder care assistance has increased recently and will probably be more in demand in the coming years. "Most relocating employees are between 25 and 40 and a growing number of them are members of the 'sandwich generation' with responsibilities for both their children and their parents," he notes. According to an earlier ERC survey in 1993, 17 percent of employers maintained a formal policy on elder care benefits. An additional 7 percent provided some form of benefits on a case-by-case basis.
</P>

<P>
But, Collie says, as the elderly population rapidly increases over the next 10 years, employers will need to develop relocation policies even more sensitive to employee concerns about their aging parents.
</P>

<P>
Employees want benefits that will allow them to continue caring for their parents as they did before the transfer. For those employees simply seeking reputable elder care facilities that won't decimate their budgets, about 59 percent of employers provide directories of services available in the new location. Slightly more than half of the companies in the ERC survey will treat elderly relatives as equally important members of their employees' households and will pay for their relocation if they already lived with the employees. And a few will move elderly relatives even if they are not living with the relocating family.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Assistance for Spouses</H3>
</P>

<P>
Transfers also are much more likely to involve dual-career couples than they did even 10 years ago. And although the typical relocating employee, according to the ERC survey, is still male, 35, in middle management and earning $55,000, his spouse is just as likely to be pursuing a career as important to the financial well-being of their family as his.
</P>

<P>
Assisting a spouse in securing new employment has become a highly requested relocation benefit. "While employers can't guarantee jobs for trailing spouses, they can do a lot of things to make the search easier," Collie says. And, according to the ERC survey, more employers now extend spousal assistance to the partners of unmarried employees. One-third of employers surveyed now reimburse at least some relocation expenses for the partner accompanying the relocating employee. And about 23 percent of employers provide employment assistance to domestic partners.
</P>

<P>
Employer willingness to help unmarried partners as well as married spouses during the relocation process suggests a greater awareness that each employee's situation is unique. Collie says that even the advances made in recent years to address employees' family concerns don't help other segments of the employee population, such as unmarried individuals and single parents, as substantially. "Relocation policies and benefits can't be one for all," he says. "Transfers must be handled on a case-by-case basis."
</P>

<P>
The search for new solutions, he predicts, will become one of the most important challenges confronting the relocation industry today.

<title> ERISA Does Not Preempt State HMO Law, Magistrate Rules</title>

<h2>ERISA Does Not Preempt State HMO Law, Magistrate Rules</h2>

An HMO must treat a divorced spouse as if she is still a plan participant--and
not charge her the full COBRA premium--because ERISA does not preempt a
Massachusetts HMO law mandating such coverage, according to a U.S. magistrate in
Massachusetts. The case is <I>Cellilli v. Cellilli</I>, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12667
(W.D. Mass. 1996).<P>

<H3>Facts of the Case</H3><P>

Mary Ellen Cellilli was covered as a dependent spouse under the group health plan
of her husband's employer, Northeast Utilities Service Co. CIGNA Healthcare of
Massachusetts--an HMO--administered the plan. In May 1994, Cellilli and her
husband divorced. Their divorce decree required Ms. Cellilli's ex-husband to
maintain her health coverage.<P>

Apparently, Cellilli believed that her coverage would continue as if she were
still a dependent spouse--without any additional premium. However, Northeast
terminated her from the plan and sent her a COBRA election notice (COBRA provides
that a divorce or legal separation is a qualifying event that entitles a
qualified beneficiary to up to 36 months of COBRA coverage. See &#182;1123 of the
<I>Handbook</I>.) The notice indicated that she would be entitled to elect COBRA
coverage at her own expense.<P>

In March 1995, Cellilli, apparently dissatisfied with her COBRA coverage, filed a
complaint in family court. She requested that the divorce decree be modified so
that Northeast and CIGNA continue to cover her like a dependent spouse. She
supported her argument with a Massachusetts law regarding the continuation of HMO
coverage.<P>

Under that law (Chapter 176G, Section 5A), a divorce judgment could order that a
spouse who was enrolled in an HMO prior to a divorce "shall be and remain
eligible for benefits under said contract . . .without additional premium . . .
until the remarriage of either the member or such spouse, or until such time as
provided by said judgment, whichever is earlier."<P>

Northeast and CIGNA removed the case to federal court. They then filed a motion
for summary judgment, alleging that the state law claim was preempted by ERISA.
In response, Cellilli argued that although ERISA generally preempts all state
laws affecting ERISA plans, the insurance "savings clause" barred preemption in
this case.<P>

<H3>Did ERISA Preempt the State Law?</H3><P>

The U.S. magistrate first noted that under the state law's "plain language,"
Cellilli was entitled to continue the HMO coverage "without additional premium,"
because she was the spouse of an HMO member prior to the divorce. Thus, unless
the law is preempted by ERISA, the magistrate indicated that the defendants'
refusal to continue Cellilli's coverage in that manner was probably an error. <P>

The magistrate then gave an overview of ERISA's preemption clause, which provides
that ERISA's provisions "shall supersede any and all State laws . . .[that]
relate to any employee benefit plan." The magistrate then noted that ERISA's
"savings clause" rescues from preemption any state law "which regulates
insurance." In turn, the savings clause is limited by the "deemer clause" which
states that an employee benefit plan is not considered to be an insurer or to be
engaged in the business of insurance under any state law that regulates insurance
companies or contracts. <P>

The magistrate determined that the HMO plan was an "employee benefit plan" under
ERISA, and the state law "relates to" such a plan. Therefore, the magistrate
analyzed the "crux" of the dispute--whether the state law regulates insurance
within the scope of ERISA's savings clause and, if so, whether it may still be
preempted under ERISA's deemer clause.<P>

<H3>The Savings Clause</H3><P>

According to the magistrate, whether a state law regulates the business of
insurance depends on whether the law: (1) spreads risk, (2) integrally affects
the relationship between the insurer and the insured, and (3) is limited to the
risk-spreading parties.<P>

The magistrate noted that "on its face," the state law did all three: (1) it
spoke of "additional insuring risks," "premiums" and "health insurance coverage";
(2) it referred to "the commissioner of insurance"; and (3) it integrally
affected the relationship between the risk- spreading parties--the HMO, its
doctors and the insured.<P>

Therefore, the magistrate concluded that the state law directly controlled the
terms of insurance contracts and was saved from ERISA preemption unless it was
excluded based on the deemer clause.<P>

<H3>The Deemer Clause</H3><P>

In applying the deemer clause, the magistrate noted a distinction between insured
plans and self-funded plans--which could not be deemed an insurance contract
regulated by the state.<P>

The HMO plan was "clearly" not self-funded, according to the judge. Specifically,
the judge indicated that Northeast: (1) offered 17 different options through
CIGNA--including 11 HMOs, and five self-funded plans; (2) stated in a publication
that it "self-funds [its] group insurance plan, except for HMO coverage;" and (3)
defined its self-funded plans as ones in which claims were paid from general
assets" and costs were based on claims experience, while Northeast paid fixed
rates for HMO enrollees.<P>

The magistrate then noted that HMOs and insurance companies share the "indicia of
the business of insurance"--for a fixed fee, the risk and responsibility of
providing benefits is shifted from a beneficiary to a third party insurer.
Accordingly, the magistrate ruled that the HMO was an insured plan unaffected by
the deemer clause and therefore subject to the state law. The magistrate remanded
the case to state court for further proceedings.<P>

In reaching its decision, the magistrate rejected several contentions by the
defendants that the state law was preempted by ERISA. For example, the defendants
argued that it would be too costly, and contrary to ERISA's goal of uniformity,
to comply with the state law. However, the magistrate was "not persuaded" by this
argument, concluding that: (1) no concrete evidence was offered to show that 
compliance with the state law would be unduly burdensome; and (2) it was not the
judge's concern if the ruling resulted in "some disuniformities."<P>

"As the Supreme Court has stated, 'disuniformities . . . are the inevitable
result of the congressional decision to 'save' local insurance regulation.
Arguments as to the wisdom of these policy choices must be directed at
Congress,'" the magistrate indicated. <P><HR>

<CENTER><H4>Practice Pointer</H4></CENTER>

<FONT SIZE="2">This case serves as a reminder for insured group health plans subject to COBRA.
As explained at &#182;2000, these plans must comply with <I>both</I> the federal COBRA
requirements and any state insurance laws governing continuation coverage rights.
Typically, insurers are familiar with these requirements and will be able to
provide employers with information on any administrative differences from COBRA.</FONT>

<TITLE>
EPA's Self-Policing and Self-Disclosure Interim Policy </TITLE>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/tpg/enviro/fixx/fixxhead.gif" ALIGN=top></center>

<h2>EPA's Voluntary Environmental Self-Policing and Self-Disclosure Interim Policy</h2>
<BODY>


<P>
On April 19, 1995, EPA released a set of 14 questions 
and answers relating to the Agency's new environmental 
audit policy. According to EPA, the policy is designed 
to encourage regulated entities to conduct compliance 
audits and correct violations they find. The following 
six questions are part two of a two-part series presenting 
this EPA document. Part one of this document appeared 
in the May issue of the <I>Monthly Bulletin</I>.<B><BR>

<P>Q: How will EPA determine whether a company has done 
an environmental audit or self-evaluation that is &quot;appropriate 
to the size and nature of the facility?&quot;</B><BR>
A: In general, the larger and more complex the operations 
at a facility, the greater will be EPA's expectation 
that the facility conduct routine and periodic compliance 
audits that are comprehensive, objective, systematic, 
and documented. However, EPA does not want to preclude 
application of this policy to companies with limited 
resources that conduct less thorough or less formal 
compliance evaluations.<B><BR>
<P>
Q: What if a company self-polices and self-corrects violations 
but does not voluntarily disclose the violations?</B><BR>
A: A company that does not voluntarily disclose a violation 
will not have met one of the conditions for full gravity 
mitigation.  Therefore, EPA  could eliminate up to 
75% of the gravity portion of any civil penalty in 
such a case, depending on the circumstances.  However, 
where criminal conduct is involved, and depending on 
the circumstances, EPA might decide to recommend that 
criminal charges be brought against the entity, since 
failure to disclose could indicate an intent to conceal 
the criminal conduct.<B><BR>
<P>
Q: What kind of cooperation normally would be required 
by EPA in order to meet condition 7 in Section II.A 
of the policy?</B><BR>
A: In addition to providing information that is reasonably 
necessary  for EPA to determine the applicability of 
the policy, the regulated entity may be required to 
provide relevant documents and access to employees 
and others having knowledge of the violation. The regulated 
entity may also  be required to assist and cooperate 
in any ensuing investigations or proceedings against 
individuals and other entities regarding the violation.<B><BR>
<P>
Q: What amount of economic benefit will EPA consider 
&quot;insignificant?&quot;</B><BR>
A: EPA will be guided by existing penalty policy provisions 
relating to when EPA will not seek or proceed with 
calculation of economic benefit. For example, the RCRA 
penalty policy provides that &quot;enforcement personnel 
may forego calculating the economic benefit component 
where it appears that the amount of the calculation 
is likely to be less than $2,500 for all violations 
alleged in the complaint.&quot; RCRA Civil Penalty 
Policy, at 26 (1990).<B><BR>
<P>
Q: What is the status of the expansion of other media 
of EPA's enforcement response policy  under Section 
507 of the Clean Air Act?</B><BR>
A: Under Section 507 of the Clean Air Act, EPA gives 
small businesses that are not major sources of air 
pollution up to 90 days, or in some circumstances up 
to 180 days,  to correct violations identified through 
voluntary participation in a state compliance assistance 
program. The Section 507 policy does not apply to criminal 
acts, violations involving  imminent and substantial 
endangerment, or repeat violations. An Agency-wide 
workgroup has been working on expanding the Section 
507 to media other than air for several months. An 
expansion of this policy is expected to be completed 
this spring.<B><BR>
<P>
Q: How does the interim policy reward entities that have 
implemented state-of-the-art comprehensive environmental 
management systems that include periodic and objective 
compliance auditing as just one of several elements?</B><BR>
A: An entity with such a system is much more likely to 
meet the requirements for full gravity mitigation on 
a consistent basis than an entity that does not. In 
addition, an entity with such a system is in a much 
better position to prevent noncompliance, and avoid 
any penalties, in the first place. EPA will be looking 
into additional incentives that we can offer for state-of-the-art 
environmental management systems as we implement our 
Environmental Leadership Project.<P>

<title>IRS Provides Model Amendment for Re-employed Veterans</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/pen_ben/plan/planhead.gif" alt="The 401(k)
Handbook"></center>
<P>
<h2>IRS Provides Model Amendment for Re-employed Veterans</h2>
<P>
In its final days, the 104th Congress passed a law requiring that plans reinstate
benefits for re-employed veterans (see the November issue of <I>Current
Developments</i>, p. 1). <P>

Does this new law require you to amend your plan?<P>

Yes, but you do not have to amend the plan sooner than the first day of the first
plan year beginning on or after Jan. 1, 1998.<P>

This amendment requirement is the result of a recent change to the Uniformed
Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), enacted Oct.
13, 1994. <P>

Congress passed USERRA to clarify many requirements for employer-sponsored
pension and other benefits programs when employees are re-employed after military
service. The USERRA requirements were effective for re-employments initiated 60
days or more after Oct. 13, 1994. <P>

Originally, USERRA required that plan amendments had to be adopted by Oct. 13,
1996. But many (if not most) qualified plans were not amended for any of the
USERRA requirements by Oct. 13, because many of the original USERRA rules were
not clear or complete. Also, makeup contributions for returning veterans could
have violated statutory nondiscrimination and other limitations on
contributions.<P>

Congress has now amended the USERRA rules through a new Code Section 414(u), as
added by the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. Now that the
qualification glitches of the original USERRA are corrected, plans must be
amended to incorporate the USERRA requirements.<P>

To help employers, the IRS issued a model amendment (Revenue Procedure 96-49).
The IRS has also delayed the effective date for adopting the amendment until
1998.<P>

The IRS revenue procedure includes two model amendments: all contributions,
benefits and service credit will be provided in accordance with Section 414(u);
and loan repayments will be suspended for employees who enter qualifying military
service, in accordance with Section 414(u). The latter amendment is optional for
those plans with plan loan features.<P>

Here is the procedure for adopting the amendment:<P>
<OL><P>
<LI>The model language is available only to sponsors of master and prototype
(M&amp;P), regional prototype, volume submitter specimen, and individually
designed plans that have received favorable IRS approval for all requirements of
the Tax Reform Act of 1986.<P>

<LI>A sponsor should adopt the model amendment in a timely fashion. No further
IRS filings are necessary and no additional IRS user fees are owed.<P>

<LI>M&amp;P, regional prototype, and volume submitter plans that use the model
language must file Form 8837 with the IRS. The IRS will not respond to this form
and no user fee is required.<P>
</OL><P>

<TITLE>Health Plans Not Subject to DOL Plan Asset Regulations </TITLE>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/pen_ben/bene/benehead.gif" alt="Employer's Health Benefits Bulletin"></center> 
<P>
<h2>Health Plans Not Subject to DOL Plan Asset Regulations</h2> 

<P>
In a change from an earlier proposed rule, the Department of Labor (DOL) has excluded health plans from a requirement that shortens the period of time in which plan assets must be turned over to a trust or insurer.
</P>

<P>
Under ERISA, employee contributions are plan assets that must be placed in trust (or turned over to an insurance company) as soon as possible after they are paid to the employer but not more than 90 days after they are paid. In December 1995, the DOL proposed regulations that would have moved up this deadline so that an employer would have place employee contributions in trust by the 15th day of the month in which wages subject to withholding were paid.
</P>

<P>
The DOL proposed a shorter deadline as part of its effort to tighten the ERISA standards that apply to employees' 401(k) plan contributions. According to the DOL, a shorter deadline for placing 401(k) participants' money in trust would prevent employers from "abusing" that money. The proposed regulations, however, included health plans in their scope in addition to 401(k) (and other retirement) plans.
</P>

<P>
However, the final DOL regulations, which were published in the Aug. 7 <I>Federal Register</I> and become effective Feb. 3, 1997, provide that employee contributions to health plans are not subject to this rule. Therefore, the 90-day rule is still in effect for health plans.
</P>

<P>
The final regulations also specify that cafeteria plan administrators may continue to rely on a 1992 ERISA "technical release" from the DOL (ERISA Tech. Rel. 92-01) stating that the DOL would not take action against cafeteria plan sponsors that do not place employee contributions in trust.

<html> <title>Congress Learns to Live With FLSA Overtime Requirements</title>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/person/jobs/jobshead.gif" alt="Public Employer's Guide to FLSA Employee Classification"></center>
<P>
<h2>Congress Learns to Live With FLSA Overtime Requirements</h2>
<body>
<h3><i>On Capitol Hill, the Overtime Pinch Continues. But Will Congress Consider
Amending the Act This Year?</i></h3><P>

Employers on Capitol Hill are continuing to feel the pinch of complying with the
Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Federal minimum wage and overtime provisions of
the FLSA took effect for congressional employees Jan. 23 and since then, support
for overhauling the Depression-era statute has been increasing in the House and
Senate.<P>

House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., told a group of human resources professionals
in March that many House members are complaining that the FLSA is unworkable --
particularly those provisions of the act concerning FLSA-exempt administrators,
professionals and executives. Gingrich's comments follow closely a report
released by the non-profit Congressional Management Foundation that found that in
12 percent of House members' offices, either one staffer or none was designated
as non-exempt from the FLSA and therefore eligible for overtime pay.<P>

Earlier this year, the Flexible Employment Compensation and Scheduling Coalition,
a group advocating fundamental FLSA reform, conducted an "audit" of a fictional
congressional office in conjunction with its study of the Congressional
Accountability Act (CAA). Adopted as part of the Republican "Contract With
America" in January 1995, the CAA for the first time applied to Congress
substantial portions of the FLSA and 10 other federal workplace and civil rights
laws (see January 1996 <i>Current Developments,</i> page 1).<P>

The coalition's audit predicted that Congress would experience significant
problems determining which of its staff members are non-exempt for FLSA purposes.
This finding was far from surprising to the rest of the nation's employers, who
have for years experienced first-hand the confusion and expense that can result
from incorrectly classifying employees under the FLSA.<P>

Since early January representatives of public and private sector employers have
been closely monitoring Congress' attempts to comply with the act. Advocates for
reforming the FLSA strongly believe that congressional experience with the act
will convince lawmakers to overhaul the statute in the near future.<P>

In practice, the reaction of House and Senate members to the federal minimum wage
and overtime provisions for the most part has been as predicted. Many members
have complained that guidance for applying the FLSA's executive, administrative
and professional exemptions is inadequate, and that the statute unduly restricts
workplace flexibility. In fact, the House recently passed a resolution requiring
Congress' Office of Compliance -- an independent office charged with implementing
the CAA -- to issue additional clarification on applying the FLSA to Capitol Hill
workers. The Compliance Office is reluctant to issue guidelines on FLSA
exemptions, and the Senate has more readily accepted this position.<P>

<h3>The Congressional Management Foundation Study</h3>

So Congress has been left to find its own way. The Congressional Management
Foundation (CMF) study illustrates Congress' compliance efforts so far; CMF
surveyed 440 House members' offices regarding the FLSA and received 167
responses. In the Senate, all 100 senators' offices were surveyed and 55
submitted information.<P>

With respect to determining exempt/non-exempt status, CMF found that in the
House, 59 percent of positions are being classified as exempt (see chart below).
Moreover, House offices are in strong agreement on the classification of the
most senior and the most junior positions, the study found, and the most complex
classification issue so far has centered around the employment position
"legislative assistant."<P>
<img src="/tpg/person/jobs/jobsmay1a.gif" alt="This table is titled FLSA Classification of Job Positions by House Offices"><P>

In the Senate, the study found that 53 percent of positions are being classified
as exempt (see last chart).<P>

Meanwhile, the study also reviewed how House members and senators are altering
their business operations to comply with the FLSA. In the House, seven of every
eight offices responding to the survey said they had budgeted $5,000 or less to
pay overtime costs in 1996. In the Senate, 74 percent of offices budgeted $10,000
or less.<P>

From these and other figures, the study concluded that most offices are looking
for the least expensive options in adapting to the new overtime requirements. In
general, this has meant offices are eliminating the need to pay overtime whenever
possible.<P>

For example, in the House, the survey indicated that offices intend to enforce
shorter work hours, more carefully monitor work schedules, trim office workloads,
increase operational efficiency and allow for less staff "down time." In the
Senate, most offices also are working to better manage their operations; however,
unlike their House counterparts, Senate offices are more openly embracing the use
of "Belo plans," a method of compensation used by employers to stabilize pay for
non-exempt employees who work fluctuating work weeks.<P>

Overall, the study concluded that House and Senate offices "are making good faith
efforts to comply with the FLSA." But, predicted CMF, "It could be difficult for
many offices to actually maintain their current workload with such low overtime
budgets. As the year goes on, some offices may be forced to confront the painful
choice of either lowering the quality of their work, reducing the quantity of
work they produce, or paying more in overtime than they have currently
budgeted."<P>

<h3>The Prospect for FLSA Changes</h3>

Advocates of FLSA reform have long lobbied Congress for both major and minor
revisions to the act. In the last two years, key House and Senate committees have
staged hearings on various aspects of FLSA reform, and pressure to update the
statute to address the needs of the 1990s workforce is growing.<P>

Prior to enactment of the CAA, several lawmakers, particularly members of the
House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, openly sympathized with
the concerns of employers that are confused or overly burdened by FLSA
compliance. Now that all House members and senators have been forced to interpret
and comply with the statute on their own, their gripes are expected to fuel
additional calls for FLSA reform.<P>

Already, several bills targeting issues such as compensatory time off (in lieu of
overtime pay) and alteration of the 40-hour work week are being debated. But
despite this heightened interest in the act and the growing willingness of
lawmakers to consider amendments, time is growing short. Citing Congress'
burgeoning legislative calendar as well as upcoming elections in the fall , many
interested parties now doubt whether significant amendments to the FLSA could be
enacted before the end of the 104th Congress. If attempts at  amendment fail now,
supporters of FLSA reform will likely have to wait until at least next year to
achieve their goal.<P>

<title>New CBO Report Offers Options for Taxing Employee Fringe Benefits</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<P>
<h2>New CBO Report Offers Options for Taxing Employee Fringe Benefits</h2>

<P>
Although the federal budget deficit has decreased significantly in recent years -- from $290 billion in 1992 to $144 billion in 1996 -- it continues to concern both Democrat and Republican policy-makers. While still too early for speculation about how this month's elections will affect fiscal policy, a recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report predicts that an <I>increase</I> in the deficit could spur a flurry of legislative action in the new 105th Congress.
</P>

<P>
And that action could dramatically affect fringe benefits. One of the strategies proposed by the CBO for managing the deficit calls for revamping the tax treatment of fringe benefits.
</P>

<P>
<H3>Why the Concern Now?</H3>
</P>

<P>
Although budget policies have nearly halved the deficit since 1992, the CBO estimates that, beginning in 1997, the deficit will increase again, first creeping and then rapidly climbing toward $285 billion in 2002 -- the year Congress and the president have set for balancing the budget. By 2006, the deficit could top $400 billion.
</P>

<P>
Congress must implement measures now to curb this trend and meet the 2002 date targeted for balancing the budget, the CBO cautions. Its report, in effect, maps out the next four years and beyond, giving Congress some options for cutting federal spending and increasing taxes to achieve a balanced budget.
</P>

<P>
The CBO prepares information reports for Congress to use when grappling with the budget impact of proposed legislation. The reports, however, <I>are not</I> legislative proposals. 
</P>

<P>
<H3>The Rationale for Change</H3>
</P>

<P>
One area the CBO examined as a potential revenue source was the tax treatment of employee fringe benefits, including employee discounts, parking subsidies and on-premises athletic facilities.
</P>

<P>
CBO offered four economic policy reasons why Congress should consider changing the tax treatment of fringe benefits. 
</P>

<P>
First, employees who receive only cash compensation pay more income and payroll taxes than employees who receive the same compensation in both cash and nontaxable fringe benefits. For example, an employee earning $40,000 in cash only will pay more taxes than an employee earning $37,000 in cash, $1,800 in qualified transportation benefits and $1,200 in other excludable fringe benefits.
</P>

<P>
Second, the tax-favored status of a fringe benefit can increase employee demand for it because being able to exclude a benefit encourages employees to use it more than if it were taxable. Increased demand, in turn, can drive up a benefit's price for those who must pay for it with after-tax dollars.
</P>

<P>
Take parking, for example. Parking subsidies encourage more employees to drive to work rather than use van pools or mass transit. When more employees drive, available parking decreases. In response to increased demand and reduced supply (so the marketplace goes), parking prices will rise. As a result, employees not eligible for subsidies will pay more for their parking.
</P>

<P>
The exclusion for employer-paid mass transportation passes can partially reverse this effect by giving employees an offsetting incentive to use mass transit.
</P>

<P>
Third, a fringe benefit exclusion is worth more to higher-income employees because it allows them to receive greater total compensation but avoid moving into a higher tax bracket. Some employees may actually fall into a lower tax bracket if some of their compensation is in the form of excludable fringe benefits.
</P>

<P>
Finally, higher-income employees generally receive more fringe benefits than lower-income employees, and their benefits tend to be more valuable. For example, some servers at fast-food restaurants may receive free hamburgers during their shifts while top executives do business over lobster.
</P>

<P>
<H3>A Tax, One Way or the Other</H3>
</P>

<P>
The report outlined two ways to tap the revenues the federal government currently loses by allowing employees to exclude fringe benefits:
</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<P>
	<LI>make all fringe benefits taxable to employees; or
</P>
	<LI>impose an employer-paid excise tax on them.
</UL>

<P>
Taxing all fringe benefits, the CBO noted, would create administrative problems, such as how to value a benefit. In most cases, valuing a benefit would be difficult for anything other than goods and services with fixed dollar costs.
</P>

<P>
For example, determining the value of a monthly bus pass is easy. A $57 pass is $57. But, how should an employer value a benefit, such as an on-premises athletic facility, offered to many employees who use it more or less frequently?
</P>

<P>
Allocating a fringe benefit's value also is a problem. After determining the total value of a fringe benefit, an employer would have to assign portions of that value to individual employees so that specific dollar amounts could be included in their incomes.
</P>

<P>
For example, suppose a clothing retailer gives its employees a 10-percent discount on merchandise from its stores. The retailer could tally all sales to employees during the year, calculate the difference between what the employees paid for the clothing and what they would have paid if they did not use their 10-percent discount, and then allocate that difference equally among its employees.
</P>

<P>
But some employees may have used the discount more frequently than others. For example, Bob buys $2,000 worth of clothing and receives $200 off his total purchases, while Mary buys $200 worth of clothing and gets only $20 off. Bob and Mary should not be allocated the same dollar value for their discount.
</P>

<P>
Recording each employee's use of a fringe benefit and assigning a value to that use is probably too complex for most employers. And, the CBO noted, even if employers implemented procedures for tracking fringe benefits and equitably assigning value to employees, the costs to the IRS to collect fringe benefits taxes could exceed any revenues collected.
</P>

<P>
<H3>An Administratively Simple Excise Tax</H3>
</P>

<P>
Instead of eliminating the fringe benefit exclusions and making the benefits taxable to employees, the CBO proposed that employers pay a 3-percent excise tax on the total costs of their fringe benefits, but only for benefits with easily determined total costs, such as subsidized parking or on-premises athletic facilities.
</P>

<P>
CBO noted several advantages to this approach.
</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<P>
	<LI>To calculate the excise tax, employers would only need to total their fringe benefit costs. They would not have to calculate each employee's individual benefit. For example, the clothing retailer would only need to tally the costs of employee discounts used.
</P>
	<LI>The proposed 3-percent excise tax would be much lower than the current 7.65-percent Social Security and Medicare tax rate employers pay on wages. The lower rate would maintain an employer's financial incentive to provide fringe benefits.
</UL>

<P>
The CBO pointed out, however, that even with this excise tax, higher-income employees would still receive and exclude a disproportionate percentage of fringe benefits.
</P>

<P>
But the report also suggested that an employer could pass on its excise tax expenses to employees more or less progressively. Through their own policies, for example, employers could more equitably provide fringe benefits by reducing compensation paid in cash in proportion to fringe benefits received.
</P>

<P>
<H3>Let the Debate Begin</H3>
</P>

<P>
The likelihood of Congress enacting an excise tax remains uncertain. Moreover, any statutory change to the tax treatment of fringe benefits probably would develop in conjunction with other, large-scale benefits changes, like curbing the exclusion for employer-paid health insurance premiums.
</P>

<P>
But when and if the debate begins, the CBO report could be a valuable prep course for both sides.

Standards Act">
<P>
<h2>Insurance Company Representatives Were Exempt Administrators, Court Finds </h2>
<H3><I>Case Is One of Few Involving Insurance Company Employees</I></H3>
<P>
In one of the relatively few cases to address the exempt status of insurance industry employees under the
Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts recently ruled that marketing
representatives and specialists whose primary duty was to contact and deal with insurance agents and
recommend insurance products were exempt administrators. <P>

Though the insurance industry is one of the largest in the country, it has spawned few controversies under
the FLSA. Those lawsuits that have come before the courts have centered on the application of the wage and
hour law's administrative exemption.<P>

In the immediate case, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich brought suit against the John Alden Life Insurance
Company, claiming that it had failed to pay overtime to its marketing representatives and marketing
specialists working at the company's Westborough, Mass., office. In response, John Alden argued that the
employees were exempt as administrators under Section 213(a)(1) of the FLSA (see Appendix I of the
<I>Guide</I>).<P>

<H3>Marketing Responsibilities</H3><P>

Marketing representatives for John Alden were primarily responsible for contacting and dealing with
licensed independent insurance agents, recommending the company's various insurance products for
end-purchasers. The employees decided which agents to contact, when to contact them and which products
to emphasize.<P>

The representatives also were the main contact for the insurance company, informing agents of new
products or combinations of new products, price changes and analysis of new or renewal business. They
often passed on information about competitors and recommendations for the company that were relayed by
their supervisors and resulted in changes in John Alden products.<P>

The insurance employees were usually college graduates with two to six years of experience whose
salaries ranged from $50,000 to $75,000. Marketing representatives typically spent seven hours per day
talking with insurance agents and two hours each day on paperwork related to their contacts.<P>

Because of the amount of the employees' salaries, the district court applied the "short test" for the
administrative exemption (29 C.F.R. &#167;541.2(e)(2), see Appendix II). Under this test, employees who
earn more than $250 per week qualify as exempt if (1) their primary duty entails "the performance of
office or nonmanual work directly related to management policies or general business operations of [the]
employer or [the] employer's customers" (29 C.F.R. &#167;541.2(a)), and (2) these duties require the
employee to exercise discretion and independent judgment (29 C.F.R. &#167;541.2(e)(2)).<P>

<H3>Administration or Production?</H3><P>

The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) argued that the marketing representatives were merely salespeople
performing production work, not administrators. Citing the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision in
<I>Martin v. Cooper Electric Supply Co.</I>, 940 F.2d 986 (1991), DOL pointed out that, in that case, the
salespeople were ruled production workers "because they actually produced . . . sales." DOL stated that the
marketing representatives were similarly situated because their main duty was the "day-to-day sales
operations of the company."<P>

The court rejected this argument, stating that <I>Martin</I> was distinguishable from the immediate case because
the John Alden employees did not set the prices or terms of the insurance policies; they promoted sales,
the court said, which was not a "production" duty. The court held that the product of the company was its
insurance policies.<P>

John Alden relied on DOL's regulations, which state:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The administrative operations of the business include the work performed by so-called white-collar
employees engaged in 'servicing' a business as, for example, advising the management, planning,
negotiating, representing the company, purchasing, promoting sales, and business research and control (29
C.F.R. &#167;541.205(b)).<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

The employer contended that because the marketing representatives were "promoting sales" and
"representing the company," they should be exempted as administrators. The company also maintained that
the insurance agents were actually the sales force for its products and the marketing employees cultivated
relationships with those agents as representatives of John Alden. Though the marketing representatives did
not design the company's insurance products, the company stated, "they describe those products to agents,
thereby promoting company sales."<P>

The court found in favor of John Alden and ruled that the employees were primarily engaged in
administrative duties.<P>

<H3>Substantially Important Work</H3><P>

Under the regulations, administratively exempt employees do not necessarily have to "participate in the
formulation of management policies or in the operation of the business as a whole" (29 C.F.R.
&#167;541.205(c)). Although the exemption does apply to those employees who have a direct hand in
business policies and operations, it also encompasses those employees who affect business operations or
"carry out major business assignments" (29 C.F.R. &#167;541.205(c)).<P>

DOL argued that the marketing representatives "have no policy responsibilities and do not carry out major
assignments." However, John Alden maintained that the representatives had "considerable impact" on the
company as the only information source to agents about the company's products. The firm also claimed that
the success of the company depended on the representatives' ability to sell the insurance products.<P>

The district court ruled that the marketing representatives' work was "critically important" and affected
the company to a considerable degree. Therefore, the court found that John Alden had met the first prong of
the short test, and proven before the court that the representatives performed nonmanual work related to
business operations and management.<P>

<H3>Discretion and Independent Judgment</H3><P>

DOL also contended that the marketing representatives did not employ "real and substantial" discretion or
independent judgment in the key areas of their positions because they had no part in setting or negotiating
the prices or terms of the insurance products they were selling, and they did not make the approval
decisions on submitted applications. DOL also noted that the representatives' decisions about which agents
to call, when to call them and what sales pitch to use did not require discretion "with respect to matters of
consequence." DOL then added that making product suggestions or proposals did not denote sufficient
discretion because such action only entailed collecting information and entering it into a computer.<P>

John Alden maintained, however, that the representatives "clearly exercise discretion and independent
judgment in significant matters." The firm stated that the employees determined when to promote certain
insurance products in five New England states, maintained communications with insurance agents, identified
the interests and needs of these agents, kept files on competitors and analyzed product trends in the
industry to determine which company products best met market needs. The insurance company also stated
that the marketing representatives often made suggestions on which new products and new features to
adopt based on information gathered from the independent insurance agents.<P>

Considering this evidence, the district court ruled that the marketing representatives "exercise significant
discretion and independent judgment in carrying out their duties" and were not merely skilled laborers
operating within a strict set of guidelines. The court held that the John Alden employees met both prongs of
the short test and were therefore administratively exempt under the FLSA. (<I>Reich v. John Alden Life
Insurance Co.</I>, D. Mass., Civil Action No. 95-40086-NMG, Oct. 8, 1996) <P>

<title>Employees Who Quit Their Jobs Are Eligible for Educational Assistance, IRS
 Rules<P></title>

<h2>Employees Who Quit Their Jobs Are Eligible for Educational Assistance, IRS
Rules<P></h2>
<P>
Employers can provide educational assistance benefits to former employees who
have voluntarily separated from service, the IRS has clarified. In a recent
revenue ruling, the IRS concluded that the educational assistance exclusion under
Code Section 127 extends to employees who quit, as well as to active, retired,
disabled and laid-off employees.<P>

Revenue Ruling 96-41 represents the first guidance on this issue that employers
and the IRS can use as precedent.<P>

<h3>Different Circumstances, But Same Conclusion,</h3><P>

The revenue ruling considered two employers' educational assistance plans. One
plan offered educational assistance benefits to both current and former
employees, including former employees who had voluntarily left the company. The
other plan offered educational assistance benefits to former employees who were
involuntarily terminated because the company had downsized.<P>

The IRS ruled that in both situations, extending educational assistance benefits
to employees who had quit or were laid off did not risk the plans' qualified
status.<P>

<h3>What Changed?</h3><P>

An IRS official has informally stated that the ruling does not represent any
change in IRS policy on eligibility for educational benefits. Rather, the revenue
ruling confirms a 1986 private letter ruling (P.L.R. 8644078), which determined
that educational assistance benefits provided to employees up to two years after
they voluntarily left their employer were excludable. (The private letter ruling,
however, cannot be used as precedent.)<P>

Despite the IRS' position that it has not substantively changed its policy, some
employers might think otherwise for two reasons. First, although the existing
regulations under Section 127 allow employers to provide educational assistance
benefits to "retired, disabled, or laid-off" employees, the regulations do not
suggest that they also can provide benefits to employees who voluntarily quit.<P>

Second, the ruling conflicts with Section 127's legislative history. According to
a 1984 U.S. House of Representatives report on the exclusion, Congress intended
for employers to tax employees on educational assistance received not only after
voluntary separation from service, but also within the entire taxable year of the
separation.<P>

<h3>Possible Impact on Recruitment and Retention</h3><P>

Few employers want to allocate their limited benefits dollars toward educating
employees who have voluntarily quit. But a closer look at the earlier private
letter ruling suggests that this assistance can make good business sense.<P>

The letter ruling considered an educational assistance plan maintained for food
handlers in a company's restaurants. Most crew members were high school students
working on an hourly, part-time basis. They earned credits toward educational
assistance benefits based on hours of service and a schedule of benefits and
could receive educational reimbursements for up to two years after leaving the
company.<P>

The company developed the plan to help employees continue their education beyond
high school. That financial assistance probably boosted the company's ability to
recruit and retain students.<P>

Furthermore, by offering educational assistance benefits, the company was able to
supplement the handlers' low wages -- about $3,000 per year -- on a tax-favored
basis.

<html> <title> Court Rules on Whether Workers Were 'Subject To' Pay Docking </title>

<P>
<h2>Court Rules on Whether Workers Were 'Subject To' Pay Docking</h2>
<body>
<h3><i>New Jersey Engineers' Case Marks the First Time 3rd Circuit Considers the
Controversial Issue</i></h3><P>

In an overtime compensation suit involving engineers and a state transportation
agency, yet another federal appeals court has ruled that an employer's improper
pay docking policy violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) salary basis
test, even though that policy was never actually enforced.<P>

In <i>Balgowan v. New Jersey Department of Transportation,</i> No. 95-5276 (3rd
Cir. May 16, 1996), engineers sued their employer claiming unpaid overtime
compensation. The state transportation department contended that the engineers
were exempt from the FLSA as professionals, but the employees disagreed. They
argued, among other things, that they were not paid on a salary basis as required
 by the act because their pay had been subject to docking for reasons prohibited
by U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) salary basis regulations (29 CFR
&#167;541.118).<P>

DOL's salary basis rules place tight restrictions on when an FLSA-exempt
employee's pay may be docked without the exemption being lost (see &#182;220-228
of the <i>Guide</i>). In recent years, controversy has arisen over when an
employee is actually "subject to" an employer's pay reduction policy. The
question has been reviewed by several federal appeals courts, and to date, their
interpretations have varied (see diagram below).<P>

For example, some federal appeals courts, including those covering the 8th, 5th
and 11th Circuits, have concluded that an employee may still qualify for a
professional exemption from the FLSA even if the employer has a policy that
<i>theoretically</i> could result in the employee's pay being docked. In other
words, the professional exemption may still apply, these courts reason, if a
violative pay-docking policy is in place but no deduction in wages has actually
occurred.<P>

Conversely, other federal appeals courts, including those covering the 2nd, 9th
and District of Columbia Circuits, have interpreted "subject to" differently.
Specifically, these courts have ruled that any time the <i>potential</i> for a
deduction in an exempt employee's pay exists, the employee is not paid on a
salary basis. The mere existence of a violative pay docking policy, these courts
conclude, is enough to destroy the exemption.<P>

Until <i>Balgowan,</i> the 3rd Circuit had not ruled on this question.<P>

<h3>The Engineers' Complaint</h3><P>

The court began its analysis by carefully reviewing the transportation
department's pay docking policy. The court found that the policy allowed for an
employee's suspension without pay for infractions such as tardiness,
insubordination and neglect of duty.<P>

DOL regulations (29 CFR &#167;541.118(a)(5)) allow employers to dock an
employee's pay for infractions of safety rules of major significance without
losing the exemption. But the regulations state that these safety rules include
"only those relating to the prevention of serious danger to the plant, or other
employees, such as rules prohibiting smoking in explosive plants, oil refineries
and coal mines."<P>

The appeals court found that the employer's practice of docking pay for
tardiness, incompetence and other non-safety-related reasons violated the salary
test. "These infractions exceed the scope of the safety exception to the
professional exemption," the court said.<P>

<h3>Status of the Pay Docking Policy</h3><P>

As a follow-up argument, the employer contended that the professional exemption
should nevertheless be retained for the workers because the employer had never
actually enforced the pay docking policy and no engineer had ever suffered a
reduction in pay because of it. In essence, the employer asserted that an actual
docking of pay must occur before the engineers could lose their status as exempt
professionals.<P>

Considering the stance of the other federal appeals courts with regard to the
issue, the 3rd Circuit embraced the decisions by the D.C., 2nd and 9th Circuits.
The 3rd Circuit concluded that being "subject to" reductions in pay for minor
non-safety-related reasons does not require actual docking of pay to have
occurred.<P>

"We conclude that the language of [29 CFR &#167;541.118(a)(5)] would be strained
by holding that an employee is 'subject to' a reduction only if an actual
reduction has occurred," the court said. "We believe that the [transportation
department's] disciplinary policy, even if not enforced, renders the engineers'
salary contingent rather than fixed."<P>

"We believe this approach more accurately comports with reality," the court
continued. "This approach is also consistent with the policy that the FLSA is a
remedial act and exemptions from its coverage are to be narrowly construed
against employers."<P>

"Finally, it would be rather arbitrary to hold that whether an employer qualifies
for the professional exemption shall be determined by the employees' collective
good behavior," the court pointed out. "If one employee violates the disciplinary
policy and is docked, so the argument goes, all the employees would lose the
professional exemption and be entitled to FLSA-required overtime rates."<P>

The court also reasoned that an unenforced employment policy, like the one the
transportation department claimed to have adopted, causes confusion as to whether
that policy is in effect and should be followed.<P>

<h3>Other Issues</h3><P>

The appeals court also considered several other points in reaching its decision.
For example, the court ruled that the transportation department did not qualify
for relief under the FLSA's so-called "window of correction" provisions (29 CFR
&#167;541.118(a)(6)) because the employer's pay docking error was not
"inadvertent." In addition, because the transportation department is a public
employer, the court reviewed the applicability of the FLSA's salary basis test
for the engineers' work both before and after Sept. 6, 1991.<P>

In September 1991, DOL amended its salary basis regulations to permit public
employers to dock the pay of exempt employees for partial-day absences (see
&#182;230 of the <i>Guide</i>). Citing prior case law on this issue (see November
1995 <i>Current Developments,</i> page 1), the court ruled that the salary test
did not apply to the engineers prior to Sept. 6, 1991. Therefore, the engineers
need only meet the "duties" portion of the professional exemption to qualify
before that date, the court said.<P>

The engineers conceded that they met the duties test prior to September 1991;
therefore, they were exempt from the FLSA's overtime provisions. With regard to
the engineers' exempt status after that date, the court held that the salary test
had not been met (due to the docking for other than major safety reasons).
Consequently, the engineers were non-exempt and due overtime for that period.<P>

<title> Retirement Plans May Limit Coverage to Employee Groups, But Exclusion
Rules Must
Be Specific</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<P>
<h2> Retirement Plans May Limit Coverage to Employee Groups, But Exclusion Rules
Must
Be Specific</h2>
<h2><i>Microsoft Loses Lawsuit From Misclassified Common Law
Employees</i></h2><P>
Many employers limit coverage under their qualified pension and 401(k) plans to
certain groups of employees. Sometimes, the covered groups are clearly
distinguishable from noncovered groups: Plans may be limited to union or nonunion
employees or employees of certain company divisions or subsidiaries, for example.
In other cases, the distinctions are not entirely clear: The plan may cover all
"regular" employees or employees "on payroll," for example.<P>
The dangers of excluding individuals otherwise entitled to benefits can be
significant. A qualified plan could be subject to tax penalties for
disqualification for this error and the employer may be required to retroactively
fund the benefits for improperly excluded individuals (see &#182;321 of the
Handbook).<P>
Two recent cases highlight the significant financial risk employers take when
trying to limit coverage under certain benefit plans through exclusion rules that
are not specific.<P>
<h3>Playing Hardball With Microsoft</h3><P>
In <i>Vizcaino v. Microsoft Corp. </i>(97 F.3d 1197, 9th Cir. 1996), the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals held that workers originally classified by the Microsoft
Corp. as independent contractors, but classified by the IRS as common law
employees, must be allowed to participate retroactively in the company's 401(k)
and employee stock purchase plans as though they were common law employees. By
allowing for retroactive reinstatement in stock-based plans of one of the fastest
growing companies in the country, the court, in effect, awarded millions of
dollars in lost benefits to these individuals.<P>
Microsoft hired the workers as freelance independent contractors and told them
they would not receive benefits. The employees also signed agreements confirming
that they would be working as independent contractors. These workers, although
fully integrated into the Microsoft work force (working on teams with regular
employees, sharing supervisors, performing identical functions and working the
same core hours), were paid through the accounts receivable department and not
through Microsoft's payroll department. They were paid higher salaries than
comparable common law employees apparently because they didn't receive
benefits.<P>
In 1989 and 1990, the IRS examined Microsoft's employment records and
subsequently ruled that these workers were employees for withholding and
employment tax purposes. After learning of the IRS decision, the workers sued for
the right to participate in Microsoft's qualified 401(k) plan and employee stock
purchase plan.<P>
The 9th Circuit ruled that these workers were eligible to participate in both
plans. The court indicated that although Microsoft could have excluded them, the
eligibility criteria of the plan did not do so. The plan's eligibility terms
included employees "on the United States payroll of the employer." The court
found no distinction in how the employees were paid -- through payroll or through
accounts receivable -- so the workers, classified by the IRS as employees, should
have been eligible to participate.<P>
The 9th Circuit also found that the workers were eligible to participate in the
employee stock purchase plan. A worker's eligibility to participate in an
employee stock purchase plan is spelled out in Code Section 423. This type of
plan, in contrast to qualified retirement plans, must cover all employees of an
employer, with only certain limited exclusions. Microsoft argued that the workers
were ineligible to participate because they had previously signed agreements
acknowledging that they would not get benefits. <P>
The court declared this argument immaterial because the label used to describe
the workers' employment status in the documents was incorrect and Microsoft could
not legally exclude common law employees from the plan without sacrificing the
plan's tax status.<P>
(The 9th Circuit includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana,
Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Guam.)<P>
<h3>Leased Employees Can Be Common Law Employees</h3><P>
The second case, <i>Bronk v. Mountain States Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Inc.</i>
(1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16155), involved a group of workers who provided services
to U.S. West and Mountain States Telephone &amp; Telegraph, and who were paid
through temporary service agencies or leasing agencies. Allegedly, these
individuals were really working as common law employees of the employers and not
as leased employees. (Common law employee status is determined based on the facts
and circumstances and a 20-factor test established by the IRS. Essentially, this
test determines whether the recipient of the services primarily directs the
individual's employment and how the work is done.) Thus, the issue was whether
the plans excluded employees who were hired as leased employees but who really
met the status of common law employees of the employer. <P>
The companies' pension plans limited coverage to "regular employees" as
determined by the records of the company. This language, according to the
plaintiffs, gave them the right to be covered by the plans because they were
regular employees. The district court found that the ERISA and tax code minimum
participation standards require the inclusion in this particular case of those
leased employees who met the definition of common law employees. The district
court ordered the parties to conduct further proceedings.<P>
<h3>Plans Can Limit Coverage</h3><P>
Both of these opinions appear to rely on the belief that if an employer
establishes a qualified retirement plan, the plan must cover all of the
employer's common law employees. This is not true. Plans of most large companies
are limited in coverage. Many other plans cover either union or nonunion
employees. Similarly, plans may limit coverage to the employees in a certain
division, location, subsidiary or facility of the employer. The tax qualification
rules permit all these exclusions; they have never been seriously challenged.<P>
Challenges may become more common, however, if courts adopt expansive readings of
the Microsoft and Bronk opinions. Plans with imprecise exclusions may find that
excluded individuals (whether they are leased employees, independent contractors,
temporary employees or otherwise excluded) will try to challenge the imprecise
exclusions to obtain some additional benefits.<P>
Aside from the tax qualification concerns, significant amounts of money are at
stake. If an employer inappropriately excludes otherwise includable employees
from an ERISA plan, the employer will have to make up lost benefits, including
possibly lost earnings, to those employees. If the lost funds would have been
invested in investments that grew substantially during the years in question 
(like Microsoft stock), the amounts could add up to millions of dollars.<P>
Is there anything that employers can do to avoid a claim similar to that faced by
Microsoft? Yes. Plans should specify in detail all groups of excluded employees.
Eligibility provisions that simply indicate that "regular" or "permanent"
employees are covered are imprecise and generally unacceptable. So-called
"leased" employees may be just as regular or permanent as the traditional common
law employees.<P>
Instead, exclusions could be drafted for individuals (whether or not they are
employees) who are paid through unrelated third-party payrolls or hired through
agreements with unrelated third-party employment agencies. The precise language
depends on the employer's particular situation and should be drafted only after
consulting with a benefits attorney. Also, sometimes it's not possible to amend
the plan to correct imprecise language. Therefore, plan amendments should be
planned and implemented carefully.<P>
A final word of caution: Qualified plans are subject to precise coverage and
nondiscrimination rules. Employers should not exclude certain categories of
employees without considering the ramifications of these exclusions on the strict
qualification tests.<P>

<H2>'Environmental Justice' Claims Cannot Strike Down Permit, Says EAB</H2>

<P>
Issues of environmental justice -- the disproportionate 
impact of a hazardous waste facility may have on minority 
and low-income populations -- can be addressed in a 
permitting decision under the &quot;omnibus power&quot; 
clause of RCRA, ruled the Environmental Appeals Board 
(EAB) on June 29, 1995.<P>

Writing for a three-member panel, EAB judge Edward E. 
Reich held in <I>In Re Chemical Waste Management of Indiana,</I> 
RCRA Appeal Nos. 95-2 and 95-3 (June 29, 1995) that 
EPA has the power under RCRA $3005(c)(3)(A) to consider 
issues of &quot;environmental justice&quot; when considering 
an application for a permit to store, treat, or dispose 
of hazardous waste.<P>

&quot;Under the omnibus clause, if the operation of 
a facility truly poses a threat to the health or environment 
of a low-income or minority community, the omnibus 
clause would require the [EPA] region to include whatever 
terms and conditions are necessary to prevent such 
impacts,&quot; noted Reich.<P>

<h3>Congressman, ACLU Intervene</h3><P>

The case arose in March 1995, when EPA Region V, based 
in Chicago, issued a final permit decision approving 
renewal of the federal portion of the permit for the 
Adams Center Landfill Facility in Ft. Wayne, Ind., 
and allowing the landfill to expand its capacity. Indiana 
was authorized to run the base RCRA program in 1986, 
but oversight of corrective action and other requirements 
under the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments were 
carried out by EPA [see <I>Manual</I>, &#182;1345].<P>

The EAB received three petitions challenging Region 
V's action, filed by the city of New Haven, to the 
east of Fort Wayne, and two residents of the city. 
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored 
People and Mark Souder, the congressman from Indiana's 
Fourth District, filed friend-of-the-court briefs. 
<P>

The plaintiffs and intervenors alleged that Region V's 
permit decision was not consistent with Executive Order 
12898, issued by President Clinton on Feb. 16, 1994. 
In the Executive Order, Clinton directed all federal 
agencies to identify and address &quot;disproportionately 
high and adverse human health or environmental effects 
of programs, policies or activities on minority and 
low-income populations.&quot;<P>

Region V erred by attempting to implement the Executive 
Order without guidance or criteria issued by EPA headquarters, 
said the petitioners. In addition, Region V's demographic 
study of the population within one mile of the landfill 
facility was flawed. They alleged that the 40 to 80 
percent of population within two miles of the facility 
is comprised of minorities, and the population is 80 
to 100 percent made up of minorities within three miles 
of the landfill.<P>

<h3>Board Rejects Claims</h3><P>

The parties opposed to the permit decision &quot;do 
not believe that the threats posed by the facility 
can be addressed through revision of the permit,&quot; 
noted Reich. &quot;Rather, it is apparent that the 
petitioners believe that their concerns can be addressed 
only by permanently halting operation of the facility 
at its present location, or at a minimum, preventing 
the phased expansion of the facility. Thus, the petitioners 
challenge the permit decision, including the modification, 
in its entirety, rather than any specific permit conditions.<P>

The Executive Order &quot;does not purport to, and does 
not have the effect of, changing the substantive requirements 
for issuance of a permit under RCRA and its implementing 
regulations,&quot; noted the Appeals Board. Under RCRA 
$3005(c)(1), EPA or an authorized state is <I>required</I> 
to issue a permit to any applicant meeting all of the 
requirements of RCRA and its implementing regulations.&quot; 
<P>

Thus, &quot;there is no legal basis for rejecting a 
RCRA permit application based solely upon alleged social 
or economic impacts upon the community,&quot; said 
Reich.<P>

&quot;If a permit application meets the requirements 
of RCRA and its implementing regulations, EPA <I>must 
</I>issue the permit, regardless of the racial or socioeconomic 
composition of the surrounding community and regardless 
of the economic effect of the facility on the surrounding 
community,&quot; Reich noted.  <P>

<h3>Omnibus Power Eyed</h3><P>

Nonetheless, the omnibus power granted to EPA by RCRA 
$3005(c)(3) allows the agency to include &quot;such 
terms as the Administrator (or state) determines necessary 
to protect human health or the environment&quot; in 
a permit, wrote Reich.<P>

&quot;If the nature of a facility and its proximity 
to neighboring populations would make it impossible 
to craft a set of permit terms and conditions that 
would protect the health and environment of such populations, 
the agency would have the authority to deny a permit,&quot; 
he noted. Similarly, EPA can include terms and conditions 
in a permit to address actual or potential impacts.<P>

Reich added, &quot;There is nothing in RCRA $3005(c)(3) 
to prevent Region V from taking a more refined look 
at its health and environmental impacts assessment, 
in light of allegations that operation of the facility 
would have a disproportionately adverse impact on the 
health or environment of low-income or minority populations.&quot;<P>

In this case, the petitioners have not demonstrated 
that the region erred in granting the permit, noted 
Reich. It held a series of information meetings and 
solicited comments from the community before issuing 
the permit.<P>

Moreover, Reich added, &quot;The petitioners have not 
demonstrated how the absence of a national environmental 
justice strategy or the absence of some other kind 
of nationwide criteria and guidance has led to an erroneous 
permit decision.&quot;<P>

<IMG SRC="/tpg/person/wage/wagehead.gif" alt="Employer's Guide to the Fair Labor
Standards Act">
<P>
<h2>FLSA 'Retaliatory Discharge' Relief Unavailable to Personnel Director </h2>
<P>
A personnel director who expressed concerns to her superiors about her
company's Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) compliance was not protected under the
law because performing one's job duties is not a protected activity as defined by
the statute's retaliatory discharge provisions, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled recently.<P>

Lori McKenzie brought suit against her employer, Renberg's Inc., and its owner,
Robert Renberg, claiming that she was discharged in retaliation for informing her
employer of possible company violations of the FLSA. She claimed her actions were
covered by the labor law, and Renberg had unlawfully terminated her. Renberg
argued that McKenzie's activities were not protected under the FLSA, and that she
was released from employment for other work-related reasons.<P>

McKenzie served as personnel director for Renberg's and was responsible for
monitoring company compliance with state and federal wage and hour laws, equal
employment opportunity laws and other statutes that regulated the workplace. In
August 1991, a co-worker attended a wage and hour law seminar and shared with
McKenzie the materials and information she acquired. Upon reviewing this
material, McKenzie became concerned that certain employees of the company were
not being properly compensated for overtime worked.<P>

McKenzie approached the company attorney and expressed her concerns. She also
later discussed the problem with Renberg. Renberg fired McKenzie 16 days
later.<P>

At the district court level, a jury returned a verdict in favor of McKenzie on
her retaliation claim. However, the court entered judgment as a matter of law in
favor of Renberg, stating that McKenzie would have been terminated for reasons
outside those related to her employer's alleged retaliation. McKenzie appealed
the district court's decision, challenging the lower court's decision to grant
Renberg judgment as a matter of law.<P>

<H3>The Appeals Court Decision</H3><P>

The 10th Circuit rejected the lower court's reasoning, stating that "the mere
existence of a non-retaliatory motive that would justify an employee's discharge
does not absolve an employer of liability for a retaliatory employment decision."
Instead, the appellate court noted that the employer's non-retaliatory reason for
termination must be the motivating factor behind its employment decision, citing
the U.S. Supreme Court decision in <I>McKennon v. Nashville Banner Pub. Co.</I> (115 S.
Ct. 879, 885 (1995)).<P>

Before the appellate court, Renberg argued that McKenzie's actions were not
protected by the FLSA and that she did not produce sufficient evidence to support
the district court jury's retaliation finding. The 10th Circuit agreed with the
first of these arguments, and therefore did not review the second.<P>

Renberg maintained that McKenzie did not assert any rights protected under the
FLSA, but was merely performing her job's duties when she reported to the
company's officers. Section 215(a)(3) of the act states that it is unlawful for
an employer:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee because
such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted
any proceeding under or related to the act, or has testified or is about to
testify in any such proceeding, or has served or is about to serve on an industry
committee.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

The 10th Circuit also has extended this protection to employees who presented a
good faith, but unproven, conviction that their FLSA rights had been violated
(<I>Love v. RE/MAX of Am. Inc.,</I> 738 F.2d 383, 387 (1984)). Otherwise, the types of
activities covered under this portion of the law are fairly explicit, the appeals
court said.<P>

However, "we have never held that an employee is insulated from retaliation for
participating in activities which are neither adverse to the company nor
supportive of adverse rights under the statute which are asserted against the
company," the court stated. Instead, the court presented examples of protected
activities that would invoke the retaliatory discharge protections of &#167;215(a)(3)
of the law, including:<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>filing a formal complaint;<P>

	<LI>providing testimony in a FLSA proceeding; or<P>

	<LI>complaining to a superior about inadequate pay.<P>
</UL>

"McKenzie never crossed the line from being an employee merely performing her job
as personnel director to an employee lodging a personal complaint about the wage
and hour practices of her employer and asserting a right adverse to the company,"
the court noted. She never initiated any actions against Renberg on her own
behalf or for another employee, the court said. She only performed the duties of
her position, informing the company officials of the risk of claims under the
FLSA from employees. <P>

The court stated that McKenzie presented no evidence that she stepped outside of
her position as a company representative, asserted any rights under the FLSA or
took any action against the company. "McKenzie . . . lacks an essential
ingredient of a retaliation claim; that is she did not take a position adverse to
her employer or assert any rights under the FLSA," the court noted.<P>

The appellate court upheld the lower court's decision, but on the basis of this
rationale, stating that "McKenzie did not engage in activity protected under
&#167;215(a)(3)." (<I>McKenzie v. Renberg's Inc.,</I> 10th Cir., No. 94-5197, Sept. 4, 1996)

<TITLE>Equipment in the Physician Network: Refurbish, Lease, or Purchase?</TITLE>

<hr>

<H2>Equipment in the Physician Network: <BR>
Refurbish, Lease, or Purchase?</H2>
Provider networks that have just survived a merger, acquisition, or other
transitional step typically keep a sharp eye on their expenses. One high-cost
area is that of medical equipment used for special procedures such as cardiac
catheterization, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, as
well as chemistry analyzers and laboratory equipment. Purchasing this equipment
brand-new is far more expensive than installing refurbished equipment (see
chart). <BR>
<BR>
If the equipment needs of a physician practice or network do not demand
cutting-edge technology, one alternative to keep costs down is to use quality
reconditioned equipment-either bought or leased. This strategy is useful,
particularly if the network notices a decrease in utilization as a result
of managed care or if the organization has other plans for the capital.
In making equipment decisions, however, purchasers need to consider carefully
what will best serve the network and whether the advantages of buying used
equipment or leasing equipment outweigh the potential problems. 
<H3>How Leasing Can Help</H3>
Companies like Comdisco, Inc., of Rosemont, Illinois, offer equipment leasing
arrangements for health care providers. From the company's perspective,
providers that lease equipment receive the following benefits: 
<UL>
<LI>Available cash for other investments and acquisitions that have higher
potential returns; 
<LI>Maximum flexibility in the face of uncertain utilization; 
<LI>Shift in financial risk and protection against technological obsolescence;
<LI>Accurate projection of equipment costs over the life of the lease; 
<LI>Flexibility to easily acquire advanced technological upgrades as they
become available or trade up or out as needs change; 
<LI>Direct link of the costs of equipment-based services to the revenues
those services generate; 
<LI>A cost-effective and flexible financing solution that makes the network
more competitive; and 
<LI>Access to needed technology without the restrictive covenants that come
with tax-exempt financing. 
</UL>
<H3>Agreement Details Need Watching</H3>
Leasing arrangements, however, are not risk-free. Recently, the financial
details of the equipment leasing contract brought one provider to court:
Under a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the
court affirmed a finding by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)
that a hospital was not entitled to Medicare reimbursement for certain &quot;capital-related
costs.&quot; The costs in question involved the hospital's use of a computerized
tomography (CT) scanner owned by an outside company. [Public Hospital of
Salem v. Shalala, No. 95-3511 (7th Cir. May 7, 1996).]<BR>
<BR>
United States Medical Management, Inc., installed a CT scanner at the hospital
and serviced the equipment under the terms of the contract. The company
owned and insured the scanner, kept the software updated, and trained technicians
to use it. The hospital's responsibility included providing the space, electricity,
and staff, as well as paying a per-scan fee to the company. The contract
did not call for a monthly rental fee or a minimum number of patient scans.<BR>
<BR>
The problem leading to the court confrontation surfaced when the hospital
wanted to treat the scanner as a capital asset for purposes of Medicare
reimbursement. The Provider Reimbursement Review Board decided that the
hospital was entitled to treat the capital-related portion of its lease
payments as capital-related pass-through costs, concluding that the contract
was a lease. HCFA disagreed, finding that the costs should be classified
as operating expenses because the scanner services failed to meet the criteria
of a lease, rental, or license. HCFA found the agreement to be a contractual
relationship-a purchase service agreement for which the hospital was required
to pay based on usage (see sidebar). When the case reached the district
court level, the southern district of Illinois affirmed HCFA's finding,
and the appeals court agreed. 
<H3>Avoiding Problems Through Common Sense</H3>
Whether a physician network decides to purchase new equipment, refurbish
used equipment, or lease equipment from an outside company, it must consider
a number of issues. Comdisco recommends, for example, analyzing the network's
equipment portfolio and inventory to determine whether productivity and
utilization can be improved through an upgrade of the equipment to a more
efficient system. From a cost standpoint, it is also beneficial to avoid
duplicating equipment throughout the network. Long-term strategic plans
often help analysts determine what equipment is necessary now and in the
future.<BR>
<BR>
From a common sense standpoint, if the equipment is going to be refurbished
or reconditioned, it is imperative to ensure that the work is done properly
and that the equipment undergo preventive maintenance procedures as needed.
Time spent ensuring the quality of the equipment is just another component
of health care for which physician network administrators are responsible.
Poor equipment might lead to such problems as incorrect or inaccurate diagnoses,
wasted time, and repetitive testing. From the patient's point of view, anything
that happens at a provider facility is an integral part of the quality of
care received. <BR>

<H2>Sidebar: Common Leasing Provisions</H2>
A leasing agreement is one of many legal documents that physician administrators
might face in the increasingly complex tangle of health care. When deciding
on the language to be used in such an agreement, it is advisable to consult
legal counsel to ensure that the agreement complies with all applicable
federal and state laws. The following sample provisions offer a few ideas
for contract language. 
<H3>Ownership of Equipment </H3>
<UL>
<LI>The equipment shall at all times be the sole and exclusive property
of Lessor. Lessee [the provider] shall have no rights or property interest
therein, except for the right to use the equipment in the normal operation
of a medical practice consistent with the terms of this lease. 
<LI>Consider offering Lessee option to purchase the equipment at expiration
of the term. 
</UL>
<H3>Operation and Maintenance </H3>
<UL>
<LI>Lessee will use the equipment in a careful and proper manner in accordance
with all applicable manufacturer and vendor specifications, solely in the
conduct of a medical practice, and will comply with and conform to all federal,
state, county, municipal, and other laws, ordinances, and regulations relating
to the possession, use, and maintenance of the equipment. 
<LI>Lessee shall maintain the equipment in good repair and proper working
order and shall be solely responsible for the costs of maintenance of the
equipment during the term of this lease. Such maintenance shall be performed
in accordance with all requirements necessary to enforce all product warranty
rights, if any, and manufacturer specifications. 
</UL>
<H3>Risk of Loss and Damage or Destruction to the Equipment</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Lessee shall bear all risk of loss, damage, theft, or destruction, partial
or complete, to any or all of the equipment, from and after delivery of
the equipment to Lessee. The operation and use of the equipment will be
at lessee's sole risk. 
<LI>Any loss, damage, theft, or destruction, partial or complete, to any
or all parts of the equipment incurred or occasioned by any cause, circumstance,
or event of whatever nature, and any total or partial loss of use or possession
thereof to Lessee, should not in any way release, abate, affect, reduce,
or impair any of Lessee's obligations, including without limitation, Lessee's
obligation to pay rent for the equipment. 
</UL>
<H3>Rental</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Lessee agrees to pay Lessor during the term, annual rental payments
of $________, payable in monthly installments of $_________ on the ____
day of each month, beginning on the ____ day of _________, _______, for
the right to lease the equipment, without demand or set-off.

<Title>Punitive damages not available under section 504, court rules<P></Title>
</head>

<body background="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif"> 
<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/fed_gts/hand/handhead.gif" alt="Section 504 Compliance
  Handbook"></center><P>

<h2>Punitive damages not available under section 504, court rules<P></h2>
A jury's award of $1.3 million in punitive damages against an employer that
violated section 504 is invalid because punitive damages cannot be recovered
under section 504, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals determined.<P>

Charles Moreno, a car inspector foreman with diabetes, proved that Consolidated
Rail Corp. (Conrail) violated section 504 by dismissing him because of his
disability. A jury found that Conrail owed Moreno $62,536 for lost wages and
benefits (which later was reduced by $24,388), $125,000 for emotional distress
and $1,312,752 in punitive damages. The district court entered the jury's
compensatory damages verdict, but not its punitive damages award. <P>

In its original opinion, the 6th Circuit decided that punitive damages were
available under section 504 (see October 1995 <i>Monthly Bulletin,</i> p. 1).
However, it later vacated this decision and affirmed, ruling that punitive
damages are not a section 504 remedy and remarking that no court held otherwise
until 1994.<P>

The appellate court decided that Congress did not authorize punitive damages
under section 504. A 1991 amendment capping at $300,000 punitive damages awards
under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act (concerning discrimination by the
federal government) showed Congress' intent to keep punitive damages unavailable
under section 504, the 6th Circuit ruled.<P>

It further held that punitive damages would be inappropriate under section 504.
"It would be highly anomalous to let a plaintiff asserting an implied right of
action under section 504 recover more in punitive damages than could be recovered
by a plaintiff asserting the statutory remedy created for section 501," the
appellate court stated.<P>

In a dissent, Judge Martha Daughtrey criticized the majority for relying on case
law that developed before <i>Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools (Appendix
IV:907). (In Franklin,</i> the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that "absent clear
direction to the contrary by Congress, the federal courts have the power to award
any appropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action brought pursuant to a
federal statute.")<P>

The 6th Circuit also affirmed the district court's finding that Conrail was a
federal fund recipient covered by section 504. <P>

The state of Michigan used funds received through federal transportation programs
to pay Conrail to reconstruct railroad crossings that the company was responsible
to maintain. Rejecting Conrail's characterization of the funds as compensation
rather than a subsidy, the appellate court concluded that Conrail was covered by
the law.<P>

This case is <i>Moreno v. Consolidated Rail Corp.,</i> Appendix IV:588.

<h2>ERISA Cannot Be Used in PHSA Case to Gain Greater COBRA Damages, Court
Rules</h2>

An argument from a state government retiree that he can sue for COBRA notice
violations under ERISA because it provides more generous legal remedies than the
Public Health Service Act (PHSA) was rejected by an Illinois federal district
court. In <I>Mansfield v. The Chicago Park District Group Plan</I>, 1996 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 17251 (N.D. Ill. 1996), the court held that, although the different
remedies in ERISA and the PHSA might seem unfair to public sector employees,
Congress clearly meant for those differences to exist.<P>

<H3>Facts of the Case</H3><P>

Robert Mansfield, an employee of the Chicago Park District, was covered under the
District's group health plan. Before his retirement in May 1993, Mansfield met
with a plan representative who did not explain that Mansfield could elect COBRA
coverage once he retired. (COBRA provides that a termination or reduction in
hours of employment is a qualifying event that entitles qualified beneficiaries
to up to 18 months of COBRA coverage. See &#182;1122 of the <I>Guide</I>.) Instead, the
representative said that Mansfield's coverage would expire June 30, 1993. <P>

After Mansfield retired, the District again failed to notify him of his COBRA
rights. In October 1993, Mansfield suffered a heart attack, and began regularly
receiving treatment related to that condition. However, because he was uninsured,
Mansfield had to pay all of his medical expenses.<P>

Mansfield sued the District alleging that, among other things, it violated
COBRA's rules under ERISA and the PHSA. He sought monetary damages (including
penalties for a lack of a COBRA notice), attorney's fees and a jury trial.<P>

The employer sought to dismiss Mansfield's claims, contending that: (1) only the
PHSA--not ERISA--applied to the case because Mansfield's claims were based on
coverage under a "governmental plan" that is exempt from ERISA; (2) the request
for a jury trial and attorney's fees under the PHSA should be denied; and (3) the
PHSA claim was timed barred based on the statute of limitations period under
state tort law.<P>

<H3>ERISA Claim Dismissed</H3><P>

The court agreed that Mansfield's ERISA claim should be dismissed, noting that
although the COBRA rules under ERISA and the PHSA are "essentially identical,"
ERISA specifically exempts governmental plans. Instead, Congress limited the
COBRA claims for state and local government employees to the PHSA's provisions. 
<P>

Mansfield maintained that, even though the employer was a governmental plan,
ERISA should still apply. He argued because the COBRA rules in ERISA and the PHSA
are "the same," the remedies and protections should also be the same, regardless
of whether a covered employee works in the public or private sector.<P>

The court noted that Mansfield "adamantly" argued this point because ERISA
provides for more remedies than the PHSA. For example, under ERISA, a plaintiff
may obtain attorney's fees, "money damages" and notice penalties of up to $100
per day. (These penalties are described at &#182;1520 of the <I>Guide</I>.) In contrast,
PHSA remedies are limited to "appropriate equitable relief." Mansfield called
this difference unfair to public sector employees and contrary to congressional
intent. <P>

The court disagreed, finding that Congress clearly exempted government plans from
ERISA and clearly set the remedies for COBRA violations under the PHSA.<P>

Although Congress' decision to provide more extensive remedies to private sector
employees under ERISA may seem "unfair" to public sector employees, Congress had
legitimate reasons for doing so, the court reasoned.<P>

Furthermore, the court determined that equitable relief under the PHSA typically
does not include money damages, such as notice or other monetary penalties.
However, it may include an award of money as restitution for losses caused by a
defendant to make a plaintiff whole. Accordingly, the court ruled that Mansfield
may recover restitution for out-of-pocket medical expenses due to the District's
alleged COBRA notice failure. On the other hand, it dismissed portions of his
complaint that sought monetary damages beyond those expenses.<P>

<H3>Jury Trial and Attorney's Fees Denied</H3><P>

The court also agreed to dismiss the parts of Mansfield's complaint that sought a
jury trial and attorney's fees under the PHSA. The court made the following
points: <P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>No case law exists regarding whether PHSA plaintiffs may obtain a jury
	trial. However, ERISA does not provide jury trials for plaintiffs. Following this
	logic, the court concluded that the PHSA does not allow jury trials.

	<LI>ERISA provides that prevailing plaintiffs can be awarded attorney's fees,
	but the PHSA does not. Therefore, the court said that it "will not read an
	attorney's fees provision into the PHSA where none exists," noting that in the
	PHSA/COBRA case <I>Brett v. Jefferson County</I> (see &#182;1900), a court declined to
	allow attorney's fees.
</UL>

<H3>Claim Filed Within Statute of Limitations</H3><P>

The District argued that Mansfield's claim should also be dismissed because it
was filed too late. According to the District, because the PHSA does not have a
statute of limitations for COBRA claims, the most analogous limitation period
should be one-year state tort law statute of limitations. Under this rule,
Mansfield's complaint was filed too late.  <P>

In trying to decide on an appropriate statute of limitations, the court looked to
the case law under ERISA because ERISA's COBRA rules are substantially similar to
those in the PHSA. In ERISA cases, courts have typically characterized ERISA
lawsuits as contract actions and looked to the state statute of limitations for
breach of written contracts. <P>

Under Illinois law, a 10-year statute of limitations applies to lawsuits over
breaches of written contracts. Because Mansfield's complaint--filed two years
after his lawsuit--fell within this period, the court found it was not
time-barred. <P>

<h2>Copyright changes to benefit blind individuals</h2>


Blind people will be able to get books in accessible formats much quicker because
of an amendment to U.S. copyright law. <P>

President Clinton signed H.R. 3754, the legislative branch appropriations bill
for fiscal year 1997, into law (P. L. 104-197) on Sept. 16. An amendment
sponsored by Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., provides "it is not an infringement of
copyright for an authorized entity to reproduce or to distribute copies or
phonorecords of a previously published, nondramatic literary work if such copies
or phonorecords are reproduced or distributed in specialized formats exclusively
for use by blind or other persons with disabilities."<P>

The National Federation of the Blind (NFB), which played a key role in
negotiating the amendment, praised it as removing the time-consuming process of
getting copyright clearance before books are made available in an accessible
format for blind individuals.<P>

However, it is unclear what effect the amendment will have  for dyslexic or
learning disabled individuals and whether its exemption applies to college
service providers. How two of the amendment's terms -- "authorized entity" and
"other persons with disabilities" -- are interpreted will be crucial in answering
both questions.<P>

<h3>Authorized entity</h3><P>

The amendment defines authorized entity as "a nonprofit organization or a
governmental agency that has a primary mission to provide specialized services
relating to training, education or adaptive reading or information access needs
of blind or other persons with disabilities." <P>

Alan Adler, vice president for legal and governmental affairs at the Association
of American Publishers (which helped draft the amendment), claimed that
university service providers are not automatically authorized entities under the
amendment. Instead, he said their coverage will depend on such factors as whether
the university is nonprofit or has the primary mission of providing specialized
services for educating the blind. "Most universities will not fall within this
exemption," he said, although he added, "it's possible they would be exempt. A
state university might fall within the exemption or a nonprofit university."<P>

When asked if service providers would be authorized entities, James Gashel, NFB's
director of governmental affairs, said, "I don't see why they shouldn't be. The
only question is if the university is primarily involved in serving blind people.
I suppose it might be said that the population is a lot broader in a university.
But I don't know why they couldn't set up a nonprofit organization just for the
purpose" of putting books in an accessible format.<P>

Rather than set up a nonprofit, John Kelly, vice-president for consumer services
and marketing at Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic (RFB&amp;D -- also involved
in the amendment's wording), suggested that service providers instead coordinate
local production of texts in accessible formats with RFB&amp;D, since the
organization clearly is an authorized entity. <P>

<h3>'Other persons with disabilities'</h3><P>

There also is disagreement over whether students with learning disabilities are
covered by the proposed exemption. "Blind or other persons with disabilities" is
defined as "individuals who are eligible or who may qualify in accordance with
the act entitled 'an act to provide books for the adult blind,' approved March 3,
1931 (2 U.S.C. &#167;135a; 46 Stat. 1487) to receive books and other publications
produced in specialized format." <P>

Adler said that the exemption did not include students who have dyslexia or other
learning disabilities, emphasizing that the exemption is "fairly narrow" and
maintaining that "dyslexia is not defined as well as blindness."<P>

<h3>Library of Congress definition</h3><P>

However, Kelly disagreed, noting that many students with learning disabilities
are covered under the Library of Congress' Books for Blind and Physically
Handicapped Individuals program. <P>

In addition to blind people, this program makes books available to disabled
people who are "certified by competent authority as unable to read or unable to
use standard printed material as a result of physical limitations" and those
certified as "having a reading disability resulting from organic dysfunction and
of sufficient severity to prevent their reading printed material in a normal
manner."<P>

Competent authority for certifying reading disabilities is defined as "doctors of
medicine and doctors of osteopathy who may consult with colleagues in associated
disciplines."<P>

<h3>Specialized format</h3><P>

Adler and Kelly agree that the amendment's definition of specialized format does
not include large print to protect large print publishers' established markets.
Instead, it encompasses "braille, audio or digital text which is exclusively for
use by blind or other persons with disabilities."<P>

Digital text, or e-text, cannot describe graphs, algebraic equations or
geographical diagrams, Kelly said, but new technology is on the horizon that will
combine audio with e-text to provide audio descriptions of such elements and
thereby "give the blind consumer the ability to move around text in the same way
a sighted person could."<P>

Kelly also emphasized that, in spite of its ambiguities, the Chafee amendment is
a major step forward. "This has been truly a hallmark effort on publishing
companies to do the right thing," he said. <P>

<title>With One Caveat, Retiree Health Coverage May Vest Under Document Terms Without Explicit Language, Court Rules</title>
</head>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<P>
<h2>With One Caveat, Retiree Health Coverage May Vest Under Document Terms Without Explicit Language, Court Rules</h2>
<P>

</P>

<P>
While lifetime health benefits do not vest under ERISA, they may vest under contract terms even without explicit vesting language, two federal appeals courts stated. 
</P>

<P>
The rulings add impetus to a growing body of case law upholding retirees' rights to lifetime benefits based on promises by their former employers.
</P>

<P>
In upholding a lower court's preliminary injunction against an employer, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in <I>Joseph Golden v. Kelsey-Hayes Co</I>., 1996 LEXIS 539 (6th Cir. 1996), reaffirmed that through rules of contract interpretation, courts will find that rights accrue or vest under an agreement even if they are not explicitly explained. 
</P>

<P>
According to the court, the evidence that expressed the plan sponsor's intent to create vested rights to lifetime health benefits included:
</P>

<P>
(1) collective bargaining agreement (CBA) language that tied retiree and surviving spouse eligibility for health coverage to eligibility for vested pension benefits; and
</P>

<P>
(2) summary plan description (SPD) language which indicated that the company guaranteed health benefits.
</P>

<P>
The claim for vested health benefits arose when a group of Kelsey-Hayes companies reorganized and cut back on retiree health benefits. Among the benefit modifications were a monthly premium contribution, increased co-payments and annual deductibles, a lifetime benefit cap of $500,000 per beneficiary and elimination of a special age-65 benefit--a monthly payment to pensioners 65 and older that reimbursed the cost of Medicare Part B premiums.
</P>

<P>
Participants and beneficiaries whose coverage stemmed from retirement before the restructuring challenged the cutback. To prevail, the court said they had to show that, under its ruling in <I>United Automobile Workers v. Yard-Man, Inc.</I> (716 F.2d 1476 (6th Cir. 1983), the employer and union intended to include a right to lifetime benefits when they negotiated the CBAs. 
</P>

<P>
The court, rejecting the company's argument that the Supreme Court implicitly had overruled <I>Yard-Man</I>, said that the Court, in <I>Litton Financial Printing Division v. NLRB</I> (501 U.S. 190, 111 S.Ct. 2215 (1991)), recognized that through rules of contract interpretation, benefits rights can be found to vest "even if they are not explicitly set out in the agreement."
</P>

<P>
Since eligibility for health benefits was tied to eligibility to vested pension benefits, which are intended to be for life, the court found that the parties also intended for the company to provide lifetime health benefits.
</P>

<P>
The court also noted that the SPD indicated the company guaranteed health benefits. One provision in the SPD stated that employees who retire without pension eligibility because they were ineligible for the pension plan would still have free, lifetime health coverage. The court agreed with the retirees that this language showed an intent to provide lifetime benefits.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Contract Terms May Create Lifetime Coverage Rights</H3>
</P>

<P>
In the second ruling, the 9th Circuit held that contract terms may create rights to lifetime health coverage, but rejected retirees' claims because they were based on language in a booklet which failed to meet all the requirements of an SPD. The case is <I>Jimmy Pisciotta v. Teledyne Industries, Inc.</I>, 1996 LEXIS 19188 (9th Cir. 1996).
</P>

<P>
An insurance contract referenced in the insurance booklet stated that the contract was the controlling document. The booklet gave Teledyne the right to modify or terminate employee welfare benefits. Therefore, Teledyne had the right to limit the retirees' health benefits, the court said. (While the case involved insured health benefits, the ruling still is relevant to self-funded plans on several points, including what documents are controlling in defining employee benefits, what claims are valid under the estoppel theory and the effect of promises of lifetime benefits.)
</P>

<P>
The appeals court also rejected the retirees' claims that Teledyne should be estopped from denying coverage because of promises made, holding that the estoppel claim is available only when plan documents are ambiguous. That was not the case here, the court said. 
</P>

<P>
Approximately 400 current and former employees claimed that Teledyne violated ERISA when it imposed a monetary cap on what it would pay for retiree health coverage. Teledyne said it would pay the entire premium for the rest of employees' and spouses' lives. A booklet issued to employees stated coverage would be continued, "during the lifetime of you and your spouse." The employees contended that the booklet should be deemed the SPD, and Teledyne's subsequent modification of benefits violated that promise of lifetime benefits.
</P>

<P>
In rejecting their claim, the appeals court stated, "The SPD is the statutorily established means of informing participants of the terms of the plan and its benefits."
</P>

<P>
Of 12 elements required to be in a SPD, the booklet contained only two, according to the court. No other plan document has such a promise of lifetime benefits, it said.
</P>

<P>
Teledyne's failure to produce a proper SPD did not create a right to lifetime benefits, the court found. A plaintiff was not entitled to a substantive benefit for such a violation, it said.
</P>

<P>
The court further stated that even if the booklet did amount to a SPD, the benefits did not vest. The booklet disclaimer stated that the insurance contract was controlling. Therefore, the contract gave Teledyne the right to modify or terminate employee welfare benefits.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Implications</H3>
</P>

<P>
Lifetime health and other welfare benefits have been litigated extensively, with courts consistently rejecting retirees' claims of vesting health benefits. Only more recently, through plan sponsor promises, have retirees found a way to successfully argue lifetime benefits.
</P>

<P>
Even that approach was limited by the Supreme Court, however, when it ruled that plan sponsors may modify plans to limit benefits if they retained that right in plan documents. That was not an issue in the 6th Circuit case. But the 6th Circuit's ruling does reaffirm that employers still can be held liable for lifetime benefits without an explicit grant of such rights. 
</P>

<P>
The case should put employers and other plan sponsors on notice that if they do not intend to grant lifetime health or other benefits, they should clearly say so in plan documents and SPDs.
</P>

<P>
The 9th Circuit's ruling implicitly states that lifetime benefits can be created through plan documents or SPDs. A troubling aspect of the ruling is that in the absence of an SPD, there apparently was no other communication to employees indicating their ERISA rights. 
</P>

<P>
Courts normally look to the SPD as the controlling document because it is typically given to employees. (See &#182;711 for a more detailed discussion.) The SPD usually controls when it contradicts the plan documents because what employees see and rely on determines what their rights are. But when no SPD exists, and the only communication of benefits rights is a booklet, under the prior reasoning it seems appropriate that the employer be bound by the booklet's terms.
</P>

<P>
Employers should ensure that they do provide SPDs rather than rely on booklets. Not all courts would agree with the 9th Circuit. Also, ERISA requires that participants be given SPDs. Without going through all the expense of a new and separate SPD, plan sponsors may use a wrap-around document with a booklet to include all the elements required to be in an SPD. 
</P>

<h2>President Clinton Expected to Apply FMLA and Other Laws to the Executive Branch </h2>

The Presidential and Executive Office Accountability Act (H.R. 3452), which applies a number of federal
laws, including the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), to the executive offices and residences of the
president and vice president, is expected to be signed into law by President Bill Clinton, according to a
White House source. He has until Oct. 30 to either sign or veto the legislation.<P>

The bill, introduced by Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., and paralleling the Congressional Accountability Act enacted
in early 1995, was passed by the House of Representatives Sept. 24 by a vote of 410-5. It then passed the
Senate with an amendment by Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. The House agreed to the Coats amendment without
objection and the bill was cleared for the president's signature on Oct. 18.<P>

"This Congress took unprecedented action by making itself subject to the same laws that govern private
citizens and businesses. My legislation will make the White House obey those laws, too," Mica said in an
Oct. 4 press release.<P>

Under the act, the executive branch of the federal government would be subject to 11 federal laws,
including the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, as of Oct. 1, 1997.
However, the executive branch would not be required to comply with the FMLA until Oct. 1, 1998.<P>

Under this new law, the FMLA's provisions would apply to all eligible employees, defined as any employee
"who has been employed in any employing office for 12 months and for at least 1,250 hours of employment
during the previous 12 months." This definition is nearly identical to that contained in the FMLA.<P>

The executive office accountability law also would call on the president or a designee of the president to
issue regulations to implement the act that "shall be the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the
Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions." The law would also allow the same remedies for
employees whose employers violate the statute's provisions, including punitive damages.<P>

<title> Newborn Case Raises Interesting Issues Under New Law</title>

<h2>Newborn Case Raises Interesting Issues Under New Law</h2>

A federal district court case involving a former employee's failure to follow
written plan procedures in enrolling a newborn with health problems under COBRA
coverage provides a good example of how the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) could affect such situations. The case is
<I>Variety Children's Hospital, Inc. v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Florida</I>, 1996 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 14199 (S.D. Fla. 1996).  <P>

<H3>Facts of the Case</H3><P>

Lynda Yoder was an employee at Lil' Champ/Jiffy Stores until October 1992, when
her employment terminated. Yoder, who had employee-only coverage under the
company's plan, elected COBRA coverage. The insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield
of Florida, Inc., contracted with CobraServ to administer COBRA coverage. Yoder
was pregnant at the time of her qualifying event, and allegedly telephoned
CobraServ regarding her coverage. She contended that a CobraServ employee told
her that her unborn baby was covered under the plan and that she should call
again after the baby's birth.<P>

In December 1992, Yoder was in an automobile accident which she claimed caused
her to go into premature labor in January 1993. Yoder maintained that she
telephoned CobraServ after her son Todd's birth and again confirmed coverage.
Todd, who required extensive medical treatment, was treated at Variety Children's
Hospital but died in February 1993.<P>

Apparently, medical claims relating to Yoder's childbirth and Todd's treatment
were denied. She then sued Lil' Champ, CobraServ and Blue Cross in state court,
alleging, among other things, breach of insurance contract, breach of contract,
promissory estoppel, bad faith refusal to pay and fraud.<P>

The case was removed to federal court because the claims were governed by ERISA.
Upon removal, Yoder conceded that her state law claims were preempted by ERISA
and filed an amended complaint alleging, among other things: (1) breach of
insurance contract against Lil' Champ and Blue Cross; (2) breach of contract
against CobraServ; (3) promissory estoppel against Blue Cross and CobraServ; and
(4) waiver against Blue Cross and CobraServ.<P>

Yoder contended that: (1) she timely filed medical claims which were wrongfully
denied; (2) even as she disputed the denial of her claim, she continued to pay
COBRA premiums, which CobraServ accepted and acknowledged; and (3) Lil' Champ and
Blue Cross wrongfully canceled her COBRA coverage in May 1993 and returned her
premiums.<P>

<H3>Breach of Insurance Contract Claim/Exhaustion of Remedies</H3><P>

As a preliminary matter, the defendants argued that Yoder's claim should be
dismissed because she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies under the
plan. The court reviewed the law in the 11th Circuit and determined that Yoder
was required to exhaust her plan administrative remedies before bringing suit in
federal court, unless she could demonstrate that it would have been futile to
exhaust her administrative remedies. (See &#182;1913 of the <I>Handbook</I> for a
discussion of the exhaustion doctrine.)  <P>

Yoder argued that her court papers alleged sufficient facts to prove that she
exhausted her administrative remedies. However, the court disagreed. It dismissed
Yoder's "breach of insurance contract" claim, but allowed her to re-state her
allegations to raise the exhaustion argument.<P>

<H3>Breach of Insurance Contract Claim/Substantive Merits of Claim</H3><P>

Although the court dismissed the part of Yoder's complaint alleging a breach of
insurance contract, it reviewed the merits of Yoder's substantive arguments.<P>

Among other things, Lil' Champ and Blue Cross both contended the Yoder's breach
of insurance contract claim should be dismissed as a state law claim which is
preempted by ERISA. However, the court noted that Yoder abandoned her state law
claim after the case was removed to federal court; therefore, her claim was
essentially a claim under ERISA seeking to recover plan benefits, enforce her
plan rights or clarify her rights to future benefits. Thus, assuming she could
overcome the exhaustion-of-administrative-remedies defense, the court found that
Yoder's claim would be viewed as a claim under ERISA.  <P>

<H3>Breach of Contract Claim</H3><P>

The court also denied CobraServ's motion to dismiss Yoder's breach-of-contract
claim, essentially relying on its view that Yoder really raised her claim as an
ERISA-based claim. <P>

Next, the court separately addressed CobraServ's argument that Yoder could not
bring an ERISA claim against CobraServ as a third-party non-fiduciary
administrator. The court indicated that several courts have held that a "plan
administrator who merely performs claims processing, investigatory and
recordkeeping duties is not a fiduciary" and, therefore, not a proper defendant
in an ERISA case. However, the court determined that this was not the situation
with CobraServ. <P>

According to the court, Yoder alleged that CobraServ had discretionary authority
or control over plan management. Specifically, Yoder alleged that CobraServ was
responsible for paying benefits and/or determining eligibility for benefits.
Therefore, the court determined that the breach-of-contract claim (in the guise
of an ERISA claim) could not be dismissed. <P>

<H3>Waiver Claim</H3><P>

Yoder argued that Blue Cross and CobraServ waived their rights to terminate her
COBRA coverage when the defendants accepted her COBRA premiums. The court noted
that waiver is "the voluntary, intentional relinquishment of a known right."
Furthermore, the court indicated that because waiver generally is a state law
claim, it is preempted by ERISA unless waiver is recognized under ERISA. <P>

The court then noted that the 11th Circuit has kept the waiver issue unresolved.
Nevertheless, even if it were to allow for a waiver claim, the court noted that
the elements for a waiver argument were not present in Yoder's case. Essentially,
Yoder's claim was based on the defendant's acceptance of premiums, which were
returned when it was discovered that they were wrongfully accepted. Thus, the
court determined that there was insufficient evidence showing the defendants
intentionally relinquished a known right or benefitted unjustly from the receipt
of Yoder's premiums. <P>

"A 'something for nothing' waiver claim cannot stand," the court held.<P>

<H3>Promissory Estoppel Claim</H3><P>

In considering Yoder's promissory estoppel arguments, the court first noted that
Yoder was actually alleging an equitable estoppel, rather than a promissory
estoppel, claim. To that end, the court indicated that equitable estoppel is not
available for unambiguous written plans or oral modifications of the plan. <P>

The court then noted that plan documents provided that individuals with
employee-only coverage must apply in writing for family coverage before the birth
of a baby to ensure coverage for the newborn child(ren).<P>

Yoder contended that she contacted CobraServ prior to Todd's birth because she
perceived an ambiguity in the plan regarding coverage for newborns and
dependents, and she relied on CobraServ's representations that Todd would be
covered under the plan. However, the court concluded that the plan terms were
unambiguous about the procedure to enroll newborns. Because Yoder did not allege
that she applied for such coverage or followed the plan procedures, the court
dismissed Yoder's claim.<P>

<H3>Implications Under New Law</H3><P>

This case raises several interesting issues based on the recent COBRA changes
enacted under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPAA). Under HIPAA, children who are born to or adopted by a covered employee
during a period of COBRA coverage become qualified beneficiaries with statutorily
protected rights. One of the issues left open by the new law is how these
children acquire those rights.  <P>

Before using the <I>Variety</I> decision to explore this issue, it is important to note
that the facts in <I>Variety</I> occurred long before the HIPAA effective date.
Therefore, the facts alleged in that case are being used for illustration
only.<P>

<H3>Question No. 1: Does HIPAA Override Plan Terms?</H3> <P>

According to the Lil' Champ plan, apparently, individuals with employee-only
coverage had to apply in writing for family coverage before a baby's birth to
ensure coverage for the newborn child(ren). On the other hand, HIPAA
automatically provides COBRA rights to children born to covered employees during
COBRA coverage.<P>

Thus, the first question under HIPAA is whether the law overrides the plan
provisions. Stated differently, if the plan requires prenatal written
certification before a child may be covered, can the failure to provide that
certification override statutory rights that do not arise until the child is
born?  <P>

This question affects a large number of plans with similar provisions and that
require a notification of birth within a certain time period for the child to be
entitled to health coverage.<P>

Although it is not clear at this point, it would not be surprising to find that
the HIPAA rules will require that COBRA coverage be offered to a newborn child
notwithstanding a participant's failure to provide a prenatal written
certification. On the other hand, it is possible that plan provisions might
survive the HIPAA change because these provisions relate more to eligibility for
dependent coverage as a precondition for acquiring COBRA rights.  <P>

Another way could reconcile the plan's rule with the HIPAA statutory rule.
Basically, the plan's rule would be followed if the child wishes simply to retain
the status of a non-qualified beneficiary dependent child under the plan terms.
Why would that be the case? Because as a non-qualified beneficiary dependent
child, there may be no additional premium (or a small dependent rate premium). On
the other hand, if the child wants the qualified beneficiary protections and
rights, the qualified beneficiary would arguably have to pay a  COBRA premium
separate from the covered employee. Whether this distinction is a valid one may
be clarified in future guidance from the IRS.<P>

<H3>Question No. 2: Within What Time Period Must a Newborn Elect COBRA Coverage?</H3> <P>

Assume that the future HIPAA guidance from the IRS provides that a covered
employee's newborn (or adopted) child retains COBRA rights automatically from
birth (or adoption), regardless of any plan provisions that would require some
prenatal (or pre-adoption) action to preserve coverage options. The next question
is how this right is to be effectuated.  <P>

Based on the statutory language, it appears that the statutory protections of a
newborn or adopted qualified beneficiary are not premised on an actual election.
Thus, Yoder's child under the new law might have had to have been automatically
treated as a qualified beneficiary entitled to elect COBRA coverage from the date
of birth forward. But if the child does not follow the plan enrollment terms,
does COBRA provide the child with a special period within which to elect COBRA
coverage, regardless of plan terms? Again, further guidance is needed.  <P>

<H3>Question No. 3: When Must a Newborn (or Adopted) Qualified Beneficiary's COBRA
Premium Be Paid?</H3> <P>

Assuming that a newborn (or adopted) child acquires the status of a qualified
beneficiary, what premium may be charged and when must that premium be paid?
According to IRS Revenue Ruling 96-8 (see &#182;1810), if a qualified beneficiary
group was treated as a family before a qualifying event, the plan is allowed to
charge that post-qualifying event "family" of qualified beneficiaries the same
total premium. Nevertheless, this is not necessarily required in every case. <P>

Thus, when a child is born to a covered employee during a period of COBRA
coverage and becomes a qualified beneficiary, the plan must determine whether the
child is to pay a separate COBRA premium (as a single qualified beneficiary) or
merely the rate charged for additional dependent children. This is not entirely
clear.<P>

Next, regardless of the amount of the COBRA premium, it is important to know when
that premium must be paid. Assume that, as in Yoder's case, a child is born well
into a qualified beneficiary's period of COBRA coverage. Also assume that the
child is born in the middle of a month.  <P>

Before HIPAA was enacted, the covered employee/qualified beneficiary had to
comply with the plan terms for adding a newborn child. As explained at
&#182;1114, this newborn child would not be a qualified beneficiary. Assuming the
plan terms for adding such a newly acquired dependent were met, the covered
employee/qualified beneficiary would have to pay the premium for this newborn
non-qualified beneficiary within the time frame required by the plan.<P>

Under HIPAA, however, the newborn child is becoming something much more than a
newly acquired non-qualified beneficiary dependent. Instead, the child is an
actual qualified beneficiary electing COBRA coverage. Therefore, one could argue
that the child has a statutory grace period for the payment of COBRA coverage. 
<P>

Ordinarily, COBRA requires that premium payments be made within a strict time
frame. (See &#182;1440 for a discussion of the timeliness of premium payments.)
Generally, the initial COBRA premium for the period between the qualifying event
and the COBRA election must be paid within 45 days of the COBRA election.
Subsequent premiums are generally due within 30 days. However, if a newborn
child's COBRA "election" occurs on the date of birth, it is not clear how these
strict time periods are supposed to apply.<P>

For example, if a child is born on March 15, 1997, when is the premium from the
date of birth due? Within 45 days? Within 15 days (that is, by the due date for
the March COBRA premium)? Within 30 days? Again, in the absence of guidance, it
is hard for administrators to know what the right answer is.<P>

One suggested approach would be the following: The child would have within 45
days from birth to pay the initial premium through the end of the month in which
the birth occurred. All subsequent premiums would be due within the regular
30-day grace period.<P>

Until the IRS issues guidance on these  issues, administrators will have to
implement a reasonable, good-faith approach to these questions. <P>

<TITLE>Experts on RMP Rule Outline Road Ahead, Answer Questions</TITLE> 
</HEAD>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/tpg/gif/tpgpattern.gif">

<center><IMG SRC="/tpg/enviro/blst/blsthead.gif" alt="Risk Management Program
Handbook"><h4> <i>Accidental Release Prevention Under the 1990 Clean Air Act
</i></h4></center><hr> 
<h2>Experts on RMP Rule Outline Road Ahead, Answer Questions</h2>

<P>
Questions about the breadth of the risk management program (RMP) rule and its application highlighted a recent nationwide video conference on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) recently finalized regulation. Throughout the day-long presentation, viewed by more than 2,000, a panel of experts from industry and EPA summarized key aspects of the new rule and answered questions phoned or faxed in by viewers.
</P>

<P>
In his opening remarks, Jim Makris, director of EPA's Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office (CEPPO), said, "If you take the RMP plan information submitted by facilities and you combine that with EPCRA submissions [data reported under various sections of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act], you have a powerful tool for shaping prevention in our communities."
</P>

<P>
Many questions presented to the panel related to threshold quantity (TQ) determinations, application of the rule to temporary operations like railcar delivery, and identification of worst-case scenarios to analyze as part of the hazard assessment requirements of the RMP rule.
</P>

<P>
How to account for, in TQ determinations, quantities of regulated substances delivered to facilities by railcar and tank truck is a "big issue that will be evolving," Makris said. A rough rule of thumb for rail cars is "if you have received it and it has been delivered, it [the quantity inside the car] must be considered in a TQ determination," said R. Craig Matthiessen, director of EPA's chemical accident prevention staff. 
</P>

<P>
EPA's perspective, however, should be coupled with how the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has interpreted temporary operations under the process safety management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), said panelist J. Steve Arendt, president of JBF Associates Inc., a process safety consulting firm. In effect, OSHA has said that facilities are not covered by the PSM standard simply because a railcar comes onsite and connects to a process without depositing an amount in excess of the TQ for the substance, Arendt said.
</P>

<P>
On this and other compliance issues, EPA is working with OSHA to establish consistency. The two agencies so far have developed a "coordination letter" that addresses compliance assistance to facilities and they eventually will negotiate a memorandum of understanding to cover all RMP compliance and enforcement issues, Matthiessen said.
</P>

<P>
One of the starting points for any facility potentially subject to the RMP rule will be the identification of "processes" that contain regulated substances and the determination of whether the TQ for each substance is met within the boundaries of the process. Matthiessen said EPA has decided to use the same definition of "process" that OSHA utilizes with the PSM standard. "Thus, you go process-by-process ... you determine the TQ by adding up the total quantity of a listed substance in each process," he said.
</P>

<P>
Related to the TQ determination is the analysis to define what parts of a process must be considered in identifying worst-case release scenarios under the hazard assessment requirements of the rule. The expert panel was asked, "How far back in the process do you need to go in identifying worst-case scenarios? Do facilities need to assume, for example, that a fire progresses back through process piping to impact various connected vessels in the process?" Arendt said that the RMP rule only requires you to look at the largest vessel or piping in a process that would create the greatest impact if the contents were released. "You don't need to go way back through a process," he said.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>OCA guidance as screening tool</H3>
</P>

<P>
To help with the task of identifying worst-case scenarios, EPA's Offsite Consequence Assessment (OCA) guidance can be a useful screening tool, Matthiessen said. Facilities can use it to analyze covered processes and identify hazard zones for a number of potential release scenarios, then choose only a few to analyze with more sophisticated modeling techniques, he said. An interim final version of the OCA guidance was released by EPA at the time the final RMP rule was signed. EPA plans to have the guidance peer reviewed over the next few months and intends to keep it up-to-date, Matthiessen said.
</P>

<P>
Several questions were raised regarding the criteria for classifying processes into Programs 1, 2 or 3, each of which entails different regulatory requirements under the RMP rule. Program 3, the most stringent tier, would apply to processes that fall within one of nine Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes and to processes already covered by the PSM standard. However, Arendt pointed out that if a process meets the criteria for Program 1, the least stringent tier, it would be eligible for Program 1 even though the process already is subject to the PSM standard or falls within one of the listed SIC codes.
</P>

<P>
One of the criteria for Program 1 eligibility is that there can be no public receptors within the hazard zone of a worst-case release scenario involving a covered process. A number of questions were presented to the expert panel concerning the definition of "public." Basically, anyone that is not a facility employee or an onsite contractor is considered to be the public, Arendt said. Thus, employees of neighboring plants are part of the public, he said. However, service contractors that periodically come onsite would not be considered part of the public because they are covered by OSHA requirements and are not ordinary visitors, Matthiessen said.
</P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Hypotheticals described</H3>
</P>

<P>
Several people addressed the expert panel with hypothetical situations and asked the panel to interpret how the RMP rule would apply. For example, one hypothetical involved a fertilizer manufacturer delivering to customer cooperatives an amount of product containing greater than the TQ for ammonia. Would the customers then be covered by the RMP rule? Arendt responded that yes, they would be covered and added that this type of situation may be ripe for development of a model RMP for co-op customers.
</P>

<P>
Another hypothetical involved a co-op with an ammonia retail operation that qualifies for Program 2. At this site, farmers come to the co-op and hook up their own equipment to the storage tank to transfer ammonia into their containers. Must the co-op consider the farmer's connecting equipment within its hazard review, which the co-op is required to conduct under the prevention section of the RMP rule? According to EPA's Matthiessen, it is up to the co-op to work it out with the farmer to ensure that faulty or inappropriate equipment is not used, and perhaps communicate this issue with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) and the community.
</P>

<P>
With regard to revising an RMP plan once it is submitted, the question was posed whether periodic changes to a process hazard analysis (PHA) for a covered process would require a facility to submit a revised plan. One of the major requirements of the RMP rule is that facilities with covered processes must submit to a central location (to be determined at a later date by EPA) an RMP plan summarizing the facility's hazard assessment, prevention and emergency response programs. "For major modifications to a process that require PHA revalidation, a revised RMP plan must be submitted," Matthiessen said. "But not the entire plan, you may need to just submit revisions," he said. JBF's Arendt said he doesn't believe a revised RMP plan will be necessary each time some change is made to a PHA--just when a PHA is revalidated, he said.
</P>

<P>
Since the RMP rule was finalized, EPA has been emphasizing that one of the primary purposes of the risk management program is to provide state agencies, the public and local emergency response agencies with information that is useful for chemical accident prevention and emergency response planning. 
</P>

<P>
In relation to this goal, an important point was raised by a hazardous materials specialist employed by a small fire department in the northeast. He said that Tier II chemical inventory data submitted under sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA created paperwork burdens that his department has had difficulty transforming into useful information. Will EPA help local responders use the new RMP plan information? he asked. 
</P>

<P>
EPA's Makris responded by noting that the new version of CAMEO emergency planning software should be helpful. He added that EPA is planning to make it easier to access and use RMP plan information electronically. Also, the agency has plans to add an RMP question and answer database to CEPPO's Internet site (the address is <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/swercepp">http://www.epa.gov/swercepp</A>).
</P>

<P>
With respect to LEPCs, Makris said they will play an important role in the flow of RMP information to the communities, although they will not be involved in enforcement unless state law grants them authority. However, EPA plans to develop formal guidance to help LEPCs perform their role, he said.
</P>

<P>
Addressing the costs to implement a risk management program at a facility, the expert panel was asked to estimate a ballpark figure for a generic, small plant with two covered processes onsite. Assuming that the facility already was complying with the PSM standard, Arendt estimated the total cost to implement a risk management program could be as little as several thousand dollars, or up to about $10,000. "The greatest cost will be the hazard assessment, but the OCA guidance will help," he said.
</P>

<P>
The video conference, which occurred the same day (June 20) the final RMP rule was published in the <I>Federal Register</I>, was produced by Coastal Video Communications Corp. and co-sponsored by EPA and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers' Center for Chemical Process Safety.
