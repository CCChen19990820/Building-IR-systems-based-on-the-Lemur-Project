Still, the fund industry is a vibrantsector with funds accounting for 17% of GDP compared to 1.7% in 1990. Todaythere are over three million unit holders. <BR><BR>Regulations allowing investment funds in Spain date back to 1958. Althoughupdated in 1994, the sector remained fairly undeveloped. The relative disinterestin collective investment was finally overcome with the introduction of amore favourable tax regime. Since 1991, in order to cater for its own depositholders interested in funds, the banking community has promoted the benefitsof this tax regime. <BR><BR>Consequently the amount of funds under management grew very rapidly, fromPta3.6 trillion in 1991 to Pta6.3 trillion in 1992, Pta10.2 trillion in1993, Pta11.2 trillion in 1994 and Pta12.18 trillion by year end 1995. Theincrease from 1994 to 1995 was less dramatic at 8.45%. Indeed, if fund incomeis excluded, net growth actually decreased. The first few months of 1996,however, look very promising according to initial figures from the industry.<H3>Collective funds </H3>There are three types of collective financial investment vehicles in Spain.They are SIMs, FIMs and FIAMMs. <BR><BR><B><I>SIMs </I></B><BR><BR>SIM stands for Sociedad de Inversion Mobiliaria. There are two types: thosewith a fixed capital (SIM) and those with a variable capital base (SIMCAV).<BR><BR>SIMs have a minimum capital base of Pta400 million and are legal entitiesin which the capital is divided into shares giving the holders voting rightsand, occasionally, dividend rights. The company is not required to havean asset manager or a custodian bank. The shareholders have total controlof the company. The drawback is that they are illiquid as there is no officialmechanism for the sale or purchase of shares other than via the stock market.There, the buyer or seller is likely to face a considerable premium or tosuffer a discount due to the very thin market for the shares. <BR><BR>The SIMCAV shares the same structure as the SIM except that shareholdersdo not enjoy preferential subscription rights. Again the drawback of theSIMCAV is its illiquidity. <BR><BR>The SIMCAV's liquidity is, however, better than that of the SIM becausethe SIMCAV can vary in size and is obliged to buy or sell shares at a priceeither 5% above or 6% below the net asset value. <BR><BR>SIMs and SIMCAVs are no longer growing, whether in value or volume. Theyhave been superseded by the FIAMMs and FIMs. <BR><BR>SIMs' and SIMCAVs' share of the investment fund market has dropped fromaround 3.8% in 1993 to 3.12% in 1994. It remained static in 1995. <BR><BR><B><I>FIMs and FIAMMs</I></B> <BR><BR>FIMs and FIAMMs are very different to SIMs. They are not legal entitiesin their own right. Investors in the funds hold units rather than sharesand do not have the legal status enjoyed by shareholders. The funds do nothave a management board but have an external manager as well as a custodianbank responsible for safeguarding the interests of the unit-holder. Thetransparency of the market in terms of reporting on performance is expectedto ensure that fund managers act in the interest of the unit-holder. <BR><BR>The funds are immensely liquid. Any unit-holder can request redemption atany time and must receive it within three days. The open-ended nature ofthe funds also contributes to their flexibility. <BR><BR>FIMs and FIAMMs are the similar in structure except that FIAMMs are restrictedto investment in short-term money market instruments. They cannot be usedfor investment outside of the fixed-income markets, nor in instruments witha maturity of more than 18 months. The two also differ in that FIMs musthave an asset base of at least Pta500 million and the FIAMMs of Pta1.5 billion.<BR><BR>Most FIAMMs are heavily invested in the treasury bill market. Spanish treasuries(letras del tesoro) are issued at three-month, six-month and one-year maturities.In 1989 there was Pta329 billion invested in FIAMMs which rose to Pta620billion in 1990, Pta2.0 trillion in 1991, Pta3.3 trillion in 1992, Pta4.7trillion in 1993, Pta5.1 trillion in 1994 and Pta7.0 trillion in 1995. FIAMMsrepresent about 57% of the total collective investment fund market whereasFIMs account for 43%. Participants in FIAMMs have increased in number from1.3 million to 1.6 million while participants in FIMS have fallen from 1.44million to 1.31 million. This shift was partly because of the poor performancesrecorded across all the Spanish markets and the interest rates in the short-termsector being more attractive than than longer term rates. <BR><BR>There are at present, four types of FIMs: fixed-income only; mixed variablerate; variable rate funds with an emphasis on equity; and currency funds.The largest group by far are the fixed-income funds which include a guaranteedincome fund introduced in 1995. The fixed-income funds have over Pta4.1trillion under management and already the guaranteed income funds accountfor Pta238 billion. The growth in the number of funds in 1995 was brisk,with 66 new FIMs of which 60% were the guaranteed income type, comparedto the creation of only 26 new FIAMMs. <BR><BR><B><I>Derivatives</I></B> <BR><BR>Collective investment institutions are allowed to invest in derivatives.Initially they were only allowed to take part in the derivatives marketsfor the purpose of hedging exposures. Now they are allowed to take positions.But there are strict controls on the extent of involvement in the market.<BR><BR>For instance, the total exposure of a FIM, FIAMM or SIM to the exchange-tradedderivatives market must not exceed 16% of its assets. Involvement in theOTC market is forbidden. The reporting requirements are also stringent andfunds must make a statement about their derivatives exposure in any informationto unit-holders. <BR><BR><B><I>Participants and fees</I></B> <BR><BR>Funds are typically promoted by a bank or broker. The investment fund manager,however, is a separate entity with a minimum capital base of Pta50 million.They are known as Sociedades Gestoras de Instituciones de Inversion Colectiva(SGIICs). There are currently 110 fund managers in Spain. Any bank, savingsbank, brokerage or credit cooperative may act as a custodian. <BR><BR>A service fee is paid to the asset manager and the custodian bank out ofthe fund. In the case of FIAMMs, the fee paid to the manager will be between0.5% and 1% of the total assets, for FIMs it will vary between 1% for afixed-income fund, rising to 2.5% for an international equity fund. Thereis a limit of 2.5% on fees chargeable. The custodian's fee is normally around0.2%. The unit-holder may also be asked to pay a subscription fee and aredemption fee of up to 5%. In practice, these are rarely charged. <BR><BR><B><I>Regulation</I></B> <BR><BR>The investment funds are strictly regulated by the CNMV. Its regulationsare based on 1984 legislation, updated in 1990. That ruling, in turn, hasbeen amended to include more recent topics such as whether or not investmentfunds may participate in the derivatives market. The legislation is expectedto be amended further to allow developments such as feeder funds, wherebyone fund may be entirely invested in another fund outside the country. <BR><BR>The regulations also define limits to which certain types of investmentfunds can be invested in particular areas. For example, one fund cannotinvest more than 5% of its assets in another fund. A fund cannot investmore than 5% of its assets in any one company. This limit may rise to 10%provided that the fund does not invest more than 40% of its total assetsin companies where it has more than 5% of its assets invested. <BR><BR>The limits on investment are redundant when the investment is in an instrumentissued by the state, a member state of the EU or by autonomous communitiesand international organizations of which Spain is a member. Funds can bewholly invested in such instruments as long as they are invested in at leastsix separate issues. <BR><BR>The regulations also lay down guidelines for reporting. Funds must be registeredwith the CNMV as well as with the ministry of finance and economy. Assets,profitability and ownership must be reported at set intervals. <BR><BR><B><I>Taxation</I></B> <BR><BR>For tax purposes there are two types of funds: capitalization and income.Income funds pay a dividend. Very few funds are income funds. Income carriesa withholding tax of 25% whether or not the income is re-invested. The incomeis taken into account along with salary and other forms of income, whichadversely affect the marginal tax rate. Capitalization and income fundsare subject to capital gains tax when sold. As long as the fund has beenheld for more than a year and a day, the gain is treated as irregular andis not added to salary for the calculation of the tax rate. The marginaltax rate is not affected. The capital gains tax is reduced by 7.14% annuallyafter the second year, making any capital gain tax-exempt after 15 years.<BR><BR><B><I>Developments</I></B> <BR><BR>The funds in Spain will continue to diversify their holdings for both riskreduction and yield enhancement. The variety of funds will also continueto increase. Funds that specialize in derivatives and risk capital fundswill appear in time as the market in Spain matures. Umbrella funds alsohave yet to be permitted. Legislation permitting those is a short time away.<BR><BR>The pension fund industry is very undeveloped in Spain so the institutionalinvestment market could receive fresh impetus from the pension funds asthey grow. Personal pension plans to date have attracted very little attentionor assets because of illiquidity - no withdrawals may be made untilthe holder reaches the age of 65. The annual limit on pension fund contributionshas also constrained their growth but this has recently been raised to anannual limit of Pta1 million. There is also reportedly a silent agreementwithin the main political parties that the legislation on the age of withdrawalsshould be changed in the next few years. <BR><BR>The impact of corporate pension plans will be greater. Legislation has beenpassed giving companies up to 10 years to externalize their fund management.That will add enormously to the funds under management in Spain. <BR><BR>Finally, a conservative party win in the March 1996 elections could signaltax changes which would spur further investment in funds. Currently fundsmust be invested for 15 years to qualify as fully exempt from capital gainstax. The conservative party has indicated it would reduce that to sevenyears. <HR><BR><B>Investment funds volume<BR><BR></B><IMG SRC="images/em.96.03.26.4.gif"WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="228" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <HR>For furtherinformation, please contact: <BR><BR>Alfonso Martinez Parras, <BR><BR>Private Banking <BR><BR>tel 34 1 349-9400 <BR><BR>fax 34 1 308-4056 <BR><BR>Paseo de la Castellana 51 <BR><BR>5th floor B <BR><BR>28046 Madrid  <p></td></tr></table><br><nobr><a href="em.96.03.26.index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Back a Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt1.gif" alt="Back"></a><a href="../../../../../services/faqs.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Help';return true"><img width=22 height=22 hspace=90 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt2.gif" alt="Help"></a><a href="#top" onMouseOver="window.status='Top of the Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt3.gif" alt="Top"></a></nobr><br><br><nobr><a href="../../../../../alert/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='ALERT - Discussion Groups, Latest News, Site Updates, Sponsors and Events Diary';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav1.gif" alt="Alert"></a><a href="../../../../../search/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SEARCH - Keyword and Structured Searches';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav2.gif" alt="Search"></a><a href="../../../../../services/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SERVICES - FAQs, Feedback, Problems and EMWL Team';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav3.gif" alt="Services"></a><a href="../../../../../contents/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='CONTENTS - Publications, World Map, Product Sections and Data';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav44.gif" alt="Contents"></a></nobr></font><br><br><font size=2>All material subject to strictly enforced copyright laws. 1996&copy; <a href="MAILTO:pbrady@pobox.com">Euromoney Publications PLC.</a></font><br></center></body></html>

The system has simplifiedsettlement procedures in Spain and reduced the normal settlement periodto only five working days (T+5). This has meant large cost reductions andincreased efficiency. Previously, settlement could take up to 15 workingdays. Because the system is centralized and has simultaneous delivery-versus-payment,the risk for foreign investors is considerably reduced. <BR><BR>The SCL is owned by the banks and stock exchanges. Within the SCL, all Spanishbanks hold securities accounts on behalf of their clients. The SCL monitorsits members' accounts, lodging not only its own portfolio but also the positionsheld in favour of third parties. <BR><BR>The SCL is responsible for: <BR><BR>* settlement and clearing of securities and cash sums for stockmarket transactions<BR><BR>* repurchasing of securities <BR><BR>* keeping account records of securities <BR><BR>* provision of data to issuer companies. <BR><BR>Once transactions have been effected on the market, the stock exchangesinform the SCL on the same trade day of the volume of securities and theirprices. This must be broken down into itemized transactions specifying ownershipand the participant responsible for settling it (which can differ from thebroker that negotiated the trade). This type of settlement is called therapport system. Transactions are settled via rapport on a delivery-versus-paymentbasis directly between the local custodian, committed to T+5, and the SCL.<BR><BR>Market members have a set period between T and T+2 to communicate the detailedinformation to the stock exchange where the trade took place. Days T andT+1 are considered normal with T+2 being reserved for exceptional tradesor for those of non-residents. In order to meet the deadline, non-residentsmust send instruction to market members as soon as possible. Market membersshould respond on T or T+1 with the identity of the holder and of the partyto settle the trade. The parties asked to handle settlement have one dayfrom notification to refuse. If they do refuse, settlement is handled bythe market member. Sales settlement requires the seller proving possessionof the stock being sold. Once proof of sale is completed, each party involvedis notified on how much they will receive or how much they will pay. <BR><BR>On the fifth day after trading, the necessary amount is settled and thetransaction entered in the relevant records including the SCL. Fund movementtakes place between the accounts that the parties have in the Bank of Spain.(Cash settlement is always via the Bank of Spain. Those participants thatdo not hold a direct account with the bank must arrange settlement throughsome other participant.) <BR><BR>A second type of trade involves non-rapport transactions which settle throughthe Traspaso system (a pseudo delivery-versus-payment system). These dealsare often settled by the foreign broker's bank rather than the investors'agent bank. The average fail rate is 10% because the lack of a real delivery-versus-paymentsystem makes it difficult to guarantee a settlement date. <BR><BR><B><I>Transfers between participants</I></B> <BR><BR>Participants may transfer securities between their SCL accounts with noneed to execute trades, provided they maintain the same ownership registrationof the securities. <BR><BR>Spanish legislation does not recognize nominees. Investors must sell andsimultaneously buy-back through the exchange if they wish to re-registerstock. <BR><BR><B><I>Buy-in and short sales</I></B> <BR><BR>When stock sold is not delivered to the central securities depository withinthe T+5 deadline, the sale is considered to have failed but given an extrasix days for justification and settlement. After these six days the SCLwill repurchase (buy-in) the stock sold in the market. When a buy-in occursthe stock is bought back at the highest price recorded on the day with a3% penalty on the gross amount of the transaction. When the cost of therepurchase is higher than the original sales proceeds, the difference ispayable to the SCL by the client of the delivering party at fault. Whenthe cost of repurchase is lower than the original, the SCL will keep thedifference to ensure no profit can be had from selling short. Members ofthe SCL cannot cover a transaction with bought stock when the settlementdate coincides or is after the date of the sale. <BR><BR><B><I>Developments</I></B> <BR><BR>There is a move towards total real-time processing which will eventuallyreduce settlement time to T+3 (probably within 18 months). There is someresistance from the major suppliers of clearing facilities in Spain whomay be concerned with late settlement costs. Those institutions providingcustody without clearing are pushing for the shorter settlement period.<BR><BR><B><I>Espaclear</I></B> <BR><BR>Espaclear is the settlement and clearing system of the Association of FinancialIntermediaries' Market. It is owned by the SCL. Although some companiesprefer to issue via the Espaclear system because it is cheaper than SCL,97% of trades are settled through SCL. <BR><BR><B><I>Settlement of public debt instruments</I></B> <BR><BR>Settlement can be domestic or through Euroclear or Cedel. Through Euroclearor Cedel, settlement can take three days. If the bonds are being transferredfrom either clearing organization to the Bank of Spain, an extra day isrequired. <BR><BR>In the domestic system, settlement is via computerized book-entry throughthe Bank of Spain. It can be the same day, the next trade day or two tradedays after trade date. Interbank dealing normally trades for settlementon the same day, while other domestic transactions will trade for same daysettlement or the next day. Non-residents mainly trade for settlement eithernext day or two days later. In all cases, settlement is on the basis ofdelivery against payments. There is another settlement system, the Camarade Compensacion, through which non-residents may settle bonds but it isless widely used because of its complex nature. <BR><BR><B><I>Accrued interest</I></B> <BR><BR>Accrual of interest depends on whether the bond pays a semi-annual or annualcoupon. (Since 1989 the treasury has issued only annual coupons on its bonds.)Interest accrues to the settlement date on the basis of an actual/365 yearusing the ISMA regulations. <H3>CUSTODY </H3>Spain offers all the normal custodial services such as paying for a security,minimizing settlement problems, collecting dividend and interest as wellas monitoring corporate actions and filing tax claims. However, few of thecustodian banks in Spain can offer a high level of automation. The differencein efficiency between the banks is wide with some banks averaging a failedtrade rate of over 20% in the last two years and some as low as 1.85% (Chemical-Chase).More demanding customers have forced custodian banks to upgrade technology,introduce new systems and become more efficient. <BR><BR>Custodial banks should be able to offer all the standard settlement services,automatic capture, management and notification of orders status, automaticmanagement of dividends, coupons and other corporate activities as wellas management of stock lending transactions and repo services. It is alsonow possible for banks such as Chemical-Chase to offer recovery of taxesin five to 30 days against the average of more than three months. Becauseof new technology banks can also offer automatic intra-day reporting withmultiple formats, languages and addresses, automatic notification of marketnews and activity, real-time revaluations, client-defined report and transmissionformats, multiple cross referencing and high speed enquiry services. Asbanks continue to invest in product automation, competition for custodialservices in Spain is expected to increase. <HR>For further information,please contact: <BR><BR>Javier Aranguren, tel 34 1 349-2832 <BR><BR>Daniel Smith, tel 34 1 349-2844 <BR><BR>Paseo de la Castellana 51 <BR><BR>28046 Madrid <BR><BR>Fax: 34 1 319-7323  <p></td></tr></table><br><nobr><a href="em.96.03.26.index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Back a Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt1.gif" alt="Back"></a><a href="../../../../../services/faqs.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Help';return true"><img width=22 height=22 hspace=90 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt2.gif" alt="Help"></a><a href="#top" onMouseOver="window.status='Top of the Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt3.gif" alt="Top"></a></nobr><br><br><nobr><a href="../../../../../alert/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='ALERT - Discussion Groups, Latest News, Site Updates, Sponsors and Events Diary';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav1.gif" alt="Alert"></a><a href="../../../../../search/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SEARCH - Keyword and Structured Searches';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav2.gif" alt="Search"></a><a href="../../../../../services/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SERVICES - FAQs, Feedback, Problems and EMWL Team';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav3.gif" alt="Services"></a><a href="../../../../../contents/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='CONTENTS - Publications, World Map, Product Sections and Data';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav44.gif" alt="Contents"></a></nobr></font><br><br><font size=2>All material subject to strictly enforced copyright laws. 1996&copy; <a href="MAILTO:pbrady@pobox.com">Euromoney Publications PLC.</a></font><br></center></body></html>

This is partly due to the demands of the European Union of whichSpain is a member, but also due to the desire of the Spanish governmentto internationalize its financial markets. Liberalization in Spain in thelast 10 years has been widespread and rapid. <H3>LEGAL FRAMEWORK </H3>The legal framework for the financial sector is based upon several importantpieces of legislation. The central bank is responsible for a monetary policybased on economic stability and meeting the challenges of the changing financialservices sector. It is also responsible for credit guidelines, banking disciplineand questions of solvency. <BR><BR>The securities market regulation is based on the 1988 Securities MarketAct and its amendments and provisions. This covers all aspects of the financialmarkets from listing to trading and control of markets and participants.<H3>EQUITIES: SHARES </H3>A share is a security which represents an equal division or proportionalpart of a corporation (sociedad an&oacute;nima). The fundamental characteristicof a sociedad an&oacute;nima is the division of its capital into shares,which incorporate the shareholders' rights. Shares can be represented bycertificates (registered or bearer) or by book-entries. With registeredshares, the owner's identity appears among the certificates' registers,while if they are represented by book-entries, such information does notappear. <BR><BR><B><I>Transfer</I></B> <BR><BR>The transfer of those shares materialized in book-entries takes place througha complex process known as an accounting transfer. If the shares are inregistered form, they may be transferred by a much simpler endorsement procedure.<BR><BR>Shares not listed on an exchange are governed by the Companies Act (Leyde Sociedades An&oacute;nimas) of 1989, as amended. If the shares are listedon an exchange, the base rule is the Securities Market Act (Ley del Mercadode Valores) of 1988. <BR><BR><B><I>Tax aspects</I></B> <BR><BR>Following the 1988 introduction of the Securities Market Act, a transferof shares, whether or not admitted to an official secondary market, is exemptfrom both transfer tax (Impuesto sobre Transmisiones Patrimoniales; ITP)and value-added tax. However, transfers on the secondary market of securitiesof companies, funds, associations and other entities, whose assets are atleast 50% formed by property located in Spain, are the exception and thereforesubject to transfer tax. <H4>EQUITIES: CORPORATE PARTICIPATIONS </H4>In accordance with the provisions of Law 2/1995, in respect of limited liabilitycompanies (&quot;Sociedades de Responsabilidad Limitada&quot;), the corporatecapital must be divided into indivisible and cumulative corporate participations.These are not considered to be securities, may not be represented eitherby book-entries or physical certificates, and may not be referred to asshares. Lack of classification as a security implies on the one hand thatthey may not be traded on an organized securities market and, on the otherhand, that such limited liability companies may not be listed on an exchange.<BR><BR><B><I>Transfers</I></B> <BR><BR>Voluntary transfers of participations among partners, as well as those carriedout in favour of a spouse, ascendant or descendant of the partner or infavour of companies belonging to the same group as the transferor, are freelypermitted, unless otherwise provided in the company's by-laws. <H3>CORPORATE BONDS </H3>Bonds may be represented by certificates (in registered or bearer form)or by book-entries. In the event that the bonds are represented by certificates,these are issued in a numbered series and are negotiable. <BR><BR>In the case of default, there is a very quick procedure (juicio ejecutivo)which allows auction of the debtor's property. The representation of bondsthrough book-entries is obligatory if it is intended that the bonds become,or remain, admitted to trading on an official securities market. <BR><BR>Sociedades an&oacute;nimas, in terms of bond issuance, are governed by theCompanies Act, the Securities Market Act and the Mercantile Registry Regulations.Limited liability companies may not issue bonds. <BR><BR>Normally sociedades an&oacute;nimas use bond issues as a means of financing.There is a requirement that the total amount of the issue not exceed thesum of paid-in share capital, any reserves which appear on the latest approvedbalance sheet, regularization accounts and balance sheet updates. <BR><BR>There are some exceptions to this limit: <BR><BR>1) When the issue is guaranteed by mortgages, pledges, the state, an autonomouscommunity, a province or a municipality <BR><BR>2) When the issue is carried out by banks <BR><BR>3) When the issue is carried out by highway licensee companies. <BR><BR>Bonds may be classified either as simple or convertible, and as ordinaryor guaranteed. The difference between simple and convertible is based onwhether or not they incorporate the right to be converted into shares ina new issue of the company, while the difference between ordinary and guaranteedlies in whether or not they are backed by a special guarantee (mortgages,pledge, guarantee of the state, the autonomous community, province or municipality).<H3>TREASURY SECURITIES </H3>The Spanish government securities market is distinguished between short-termtreasury debt, both bills and notes (Deuda del Tesoro) and longer term statedebt (Deuda del Estado). <BR><BR><B><I>Deuda del Tesoro</I></B> <BR><BR>Deuda del Tesoro are short-term securities issued by the Bank of Spain tobolster cash flow or to fulfil monetary policy goals. <BR><BR>The Bank of Spain issues treasury bills or notes (Letras del Tesoro or Pagar&eacute;sdel Tesoro) which are normally acquired by private banks, savings banksand by money market dealers. Letras del Tesoro usually have a duration of12 months. Pagar&eacute;s del Tesoro have a maximum redemption period of18 months. <BR><BR><B><I>Deuda del Estado</I></B> <BR><BR>Deuda del Estado are medium-term and long-term bonds issued to finance publicexpenditure and official credit. State bonds are medium-term (five years),while debentures are 10 years. The structure of the Spanish government debtmarket structure was altered to a book-entry system with the 1986 StateBudgetary Act, based on articles of the General Budgetary Act. This newsystem permits greater speed in securities trading. <BR><BR>Both the short-term and long-term treasury markets have experienced stronggrowth in Spain in recent years, due principally to a decline in interestrates. Investors have been able to secure high returns which enjoy the guaranteeof the state. <H3>FOREIGN EXCHANGE </H3>Currency market regulations have changed profoundly because of liberalizationin the European Union. This liberalization has created significant modificationsin both the spot and forward markets. One important change is the tradingof the peseta directly against all of the EU currencies instead of calculatingforeign exchange by cross-rates via the dollar. In addition, because ofthe new foreign exchange freedom, banks can now establish their own fixingor average foreign currency exchange rates which may differ from those publishedby the Bank of Spain. <BR><BR>Furthermore, individuals and legal entities, either resident or non-residentin Spain, may obtain loans and credits in foreign currencies or in pesetas,granted either from within or outside Spain. When a resident or non-residentapplies to a bank for financing in Spain it is not necessary to obtain anyprevious authorization on the part of the government, no matter what theamount is. If the financing is applied for abroad, a resident will needto obtain a financial transaction number (N&uacute;mero de Operaci&oacute;nFinanciera or NOF). This is generally assigned by the Bank of Spain, andits purpose is to allow the central bank to obtain statistical data on thecountry's foreign indebtedness. Loans and credits from non-residents toresidents and vice versa are regulated by Bank of Spain Circular 23/1992.<BR><BR>Both resident and non-resident persons (individuals or legal entities) mayopen and maintain current accounts, savings accounts and term deposits,in pesetas or foreign currency, within or outside Spain. Non-resident personswho wish to open this type of account in Spain must demonstrate their non-residentstatus to the registered entity and confirm such status every two years.Such accounts are regulated by a 1991 ministry of economy and finance orderand the Bank of Spain Circular 1/1994. <H3>DERIVATIVES </H3><B><I>Futures and Options</I></B> <BR><BR>In Spain, there are two official organized markets for financial futures.On one, options and financial futures on fixed-income are traded. It isgoverned by a company called MEFF Sociedad Rectora de Productos FinancierosDerivados de Renta Fija, headquartered in Barcelona. The other market tradesequity derivatives, and is governed by a company named MEFF Renta Variable,headquartered in Madrid. The capital of both companies is wholly owned byMEFF Sociedad Holding de Productos Financieros Derivados, also headquarteredin Barcelona. MEFF is the equivalent of the London International FInancialFutures Exchange (Liffe). <BR><BR>Bearing in mind that derivatives contracts are recent creations in Spain,the regulations are generally insufficient. For purely contractual aspects,the Royal Decree 1814/1991 regulates the official futures and options markets.In addition there are other laws and acts which regulate different aspectsof the market such as the 1993 amended Bank of Spain Circular 4/1991 whichrefers to contracts and their form of accounting; articles 31, 59 and 77of the Securities Market Act, which created the futures and options marketsin Spain; and the 1989 treasury and financial policy resolution which allowsfutures and options on public debt book entries. <BR><BR>In Spain, no specific rules regulate commodities although in 1995 a newmarket for futures and options on citrus fruit was created in Valencia.This market follows the model of the Chicago commodities exchange. <H3>CUSTODY AND SETTLEMENT </H3>Settlement refers to the delivery of securities subject to trading. It alsorefers to the payment for such securities. Initially, because all securitieswere represented by physical certificates, settlement implied the physicalmovement of the certificates. This is what is now known as the traditionalsystem. <BR><BR>The proliferation of sociedades anonimas with high levels of capital createda massive onset of certificates, the possession of which became necessaryin order to exercise shareholder rights. Therefore, a system was neededwhich would be capable of transferring shares, bonds and coupons, as wellas a system for the exercise of the rights they incorporate, without theneed physically to mobilize, manipulate or materially transfer anything.A 1974 decree implemented by ministerial order in the same year createda new system for clearing and settling securities transactions. <BR><BR>Only securities which officially trade on the securities exchanges (Madrid,Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia) may be admitted to this system. In addition,they must meet certain requirements: <BR><BR>1) that the governing bodies of the exchanges on which they trade allowthem to be so traded <BR><BR>2) that they be possessed by a member entity of the system <BR><BR>3) that they not be subject to any condition which prevents their beingtreated as fungible <BR><BR>4) that they not be subject to any pledge, retention, or lien. <BR><BR>In order to settle securities transactions, the governing body of each exchangeorganizes a settlement and clearing service which, in addition to controllingthe securities included in the system, takes care of their accounting instrumentationand registration. The service will open accounts, in respect of the movementsof securities, in the names of the member entities of the system. Theseaccounts will be set off on each class of security, in which the securitiesbought and sold during each securities exchange session are paid and chargedto them. <BR><BR>The 1992 General Directorate of International Economy and Foreign Transactions(Direcci&oacute;n General de Econom&iacute;a Internacional y TransaccionesExteriores or DGEITE) resolution states that investors non-resident in Spainwho subscribe or acquire securities which are negotiable on the Spanishmarket must maintain their securities accounts or custody of certificatesat a Spanish entity (banks, savings banks, credit cooperatives, and evenbroker/dealers). The holders of these accounts may freely transfer themfrom one entity to another. <H3>DIRECT INVESTMENT </H3>In recent years, liberalization has bolstered foreign capital inflows toSpain. The Royal Decree 671/1992 establishes the legal framework for thistype of investment and was adapted to take into account the current statusof the Spanish economy and European Community regulations. (Directive 88/361in 1988 liberalized the movements of capital between persons residing inmember states of the EU.) <BR><BR>Those investments made by governments and entities of foreign sovereigntybelonging to non-community states require authorization by the Spanish councilof ministers, unless they are allowed by virtue of international treatiessigned and ratified by Spain. <BR><BR>According to the royal decree, direct foreign investments are deemed tobe those which are: <BR><BR>* participation in Spanish companies where the investor may effectivelyinfluence the management or control of the company by its participationor what its participation would become <BR><BR>* the establishment and expansion of branches, as well as the granting ofrepayable advances <BR><BR>* the granting of long-term (greater than five years) loans to Spanish companies<BR><BR>* the capitalization of reserves and reinvestment of undistributed profits<BR><BR>* the acquisition of property when such acquisition in itself constitutesa business activity. <BR><BR><B><I>Scheme of direct investments</I></B> <BR><BR>In general, this type of investment is freely permitted and only requiresprior administrative clearance from the General Directorate of InternationalEconomy and Foreign Transactions (DGEITE) in certain circumstances. <BR><BR>These are when: <BR><BR>* the foreign holding exceeds 50% of the capital of the Spanish companywhich receives the investment and any of the following circumstances arepresent: <BR><BR>- that the amount of the investment exceeds Pta500 million <BR><BR>- that the foreign holding in the share capital plus reserves of the Spanishcompany is greater than Pta500 million <BR><BR>* the amount of the loans or the amount of the establishment or expansionof branches exceeds Pta500 million or comes from natural persons or legalentities resident in tax havens; <BR><BR>* the foreign holding exceeds 50% of the capital of the Spanish companyreceiving the investment and any of the investors is a natural person orlegal entity resident in a tax haven. <BR><BR><B><I>Declaration and registration</I></B> <BR><BR>Foreign investments must formally be made by means of a document authorizedby a Spanish certifying official and declared to the investment registryof the ministry of economy and finance. <H3>TRADE FINANCE </H3><B><I>Official export credit</I></B> <BR><BR>This is an officially-backed credit which is granted to finance the amountof an export contract for Spanish goods and services. Not all types of goodsare included, but rather equipment and factories, second-hand goods, boatsand aircraft, etc. Consumer goods and agricultural products, as well asmilitary goods, are excluded. <BR><BR>The following forms of credit exist: <BR><BR>* credit to the domestic supplier; <BR><BR>* credit to the foreign purchaser. <BR><BR>With regard to the first type of credit, the exporter receives from theimporter at least 15% of the amount of the commercial contract (advancepayment) and receives from the financial entity a credit for 85%, whichit is obliged to repay. <BR><BR>The importer will pay the deferred amount of the commercial contract (85%),the amount of which the exporter will normally apply towards cancellingthe credit granted by the bank. <BR><BR>In the second case, the importer is bound to the financial entity. Normally,however, a financing entity other than the importer and from the same countrymay appear, who will assume the payment obligation in the name of the importer.This credit only becomes effective when the exporter receives the advancepayment, which is also referred to as a deposit or down payment (at least15% of the amount of the commercial contract). Within this form, two typesexist: <BR><BR>* individual credit agreement: this refers to a credit designed and negotiatedto finance a specific export contract <BR><BR>* line of credit: this is a standard agreement or global credit limit againstwhich, and up until the limit of which, operations in respect of variouscommercial agreements may be financed. <BR><BR>The following regulations govern these credits: <BR><BR>* Law 11/1983; <BR><BR>* Royal Decree 322/1987 ; <BR><BR>* Ministerial Order of March 5 1987 <BR><BR>* Resolution of March 13 1987 of the General Directorate of Commercial Policy<BR><BR>* Ministerial Order of March 8 1988 <BR><BR>These regulations are compatible with the international frame of reference,called OECD consensus, for this type of financing. The consensus becameeffective in April 1978, and is an informal agreement which establishesa self-imposed limitation on the conditions and practices in respect ofexport credit (minimum interest rates, amortization periods, prepayment,etc). <BR><BR><B><I>Export credit insurance</I></B> <BR><BR>Normally, entities financing these operations take out a policy with Compa&ntilde;&iacute;aEspa&ntilde;ola de Seguros de Cr&eacute;dito a la Exportaci&oacute;n (CESCE),an insurance and underwriting company the majority of whose capital is ownedby the Spanish state. The policy covers any credit (or non-payment) risksderiving from these operations. Such risks of non-payment may be due tocommercial, political, or extraordinary natural causes. <BR><BR>One of the characteristics of these export credits is that they often aresubject to fixed, below-market interest rates. This characteristic, togetherwith others, such as customarily long amortization periods, make them inadvisableas an investment alternative. <BR><BR>In order to pay the difference between the cost of funds for the financingbank and the OECD consensus rate, in 1983 the state introduced an agreementfor reciprocal interest adjustment, called Contrato de Ajuste Reciprocode Intereses or CARI. Through the system, the Official Credit Institute(Instituto de Cr&eacute;dito Oficial or ICO) is required to pay to the financingentity a constant return during the life of the credit, in order that thebank will grant the credit under conditions which are more advantageousto the borrower than those which would otherwise prevail in the market.<HR><BR><BR><B>Foreign investment in Spanish stock exchanges</B> <IMG SRC="images/em.96.03.26.6.gif"WIDTH="442" HEIGHT="241" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <BR>For further information, contact: <H3>ESTUDIO LEGAL <BR>ABOGADOS </H3>_____________________________ <BR><BR>Luis Fernando Lopez-Chicheri <BR><BR>c/ Vel&aacute;zquez, 51 <BR><BR>28001-Madrid <BR><BR>Tel: (34-1) 578.06.43 <BR><BR>Fax: (34-1) 431.21.52 <p></td></tr></table><br><nobr><a href="em.96.03.26.index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Back a Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt1.gif" alt="Back"></a><a href="../../../../../services/faqs.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Help';return true"><img width=22 height=22 hspace=90 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt2.gif" alt="Help"></a><a href="#top" onMouseOver="window.status='Top of the Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt3.gif" alt="Top"></a></nobr><br><br><nobr><a href="../../../../../alert/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='ALERT - Discussion Groups, Latest News, Site Updates, Sponsors and Events Diary';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav1.gif" alt="Alert"></a><a href="../../../../../search/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SEARCH - Keyword and Structured Searches';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav2.gif" alt="Search"></a><a href="../../../../../services/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SERVICES - FAQs, Feedback, Problems and EMWL Team';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav3.gif" alt="Services"></a><a href="../../../../../contents/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='CONTENTS - Publications, World Map, Product Sections and Data';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav44.gif" alt="Contents"></a></nobr></font><br><br><font size=2>All material subject to strictly enforced copyright laws. 1996&copy; <a href="MAILTO:pbrady@pobox.com">Euromoney Publications PLC.</a></font><br></center></body></html>

It has been further estimated that thesefunds generate an annual cash flow, in the form of dividends and interest,of be- <BR><BR>tween Swfr70 billion and Swfr100 billion. <BR><BR>Between 60% and 70% of these funds are believed to be owned by private individuals.While French, Italian and German individuals have traditionally channelledtheir savings into Switzerland, investors from all over the world are nowmaking good use of the Swiss financial market. The main international fundmanagers in Europe are the three big Swiss banks, while the numerous Swissprivate banks, notably in Geneva, Zurich, Basle and Lugano also manage largefunds. In addition, the insurance companies and pension funds are increasinglyinvesting in international bonds and equity related securities. <BR><BR>Because of the large amounts of funds under management and a broad investorbase, Swiss banks have become major players in financial centres such asNew York, London, Tokyo and Frankfurt. They place debt and equity productsin all currencies both in-house and directly to external institutional and/orprivate investors. In particular, they have special expertise in the underwritingand placement of Swiss franc denominated bond and note issues for domesticand foreign borrowers. <BR><BR><B><I>The fixed-income market</I></B> <BR><BR>Foreign issuers in the Swiss franc bond market again led the way in 1995,representing 57% of all issues launched during the year, with a total of301 transactions and a volume of Swfr33.7 billion. Domestic issuers (includingthe Swiss government), tapped the market on 187 occasions and for a totalof Swfr25.3 billion. <BR><BR>There are two main types of instruments in the Swiss fixed-income capitalmarket: publicly-listed bonds and unlisted notes. Bonds and notes differprimarily in denomination, maturity and the fact that the latter are notlisted. Notes are not genuine private placements, although they are sometimesstill called so. <BR><BR>An ever increasing number of international borrowers have put medium termnote programmes (MTNs), or Euro-medium term note programmes (EMTNs), inplace over recent years. While one-to-one transactions (ie one borrower,one investor) have been frequently issued under MTN programmes involvingSwiss francs, the issuing of Swiss franc denominated public bonds underan MTN programme still needs to be clarified in the context of the currentlisting regulations of the Swiss Admission Board. These listing regulationsare now being revised with a view to creating a more modern and less restrictiveset of rules this year. <BR><BR>Other products common to the Swiss market include convertible bonds, whichare very popular for issuers from the Far East, traded bond derivatives,OTC options, structured products and bond warrants. The market for warrantson Swiss government bonds is particularly active, as well as other warrantson US, Asian and European bonds, offered to Swiss and foreign clients. <BR><BR><B><I>The domestic bond market</I></B> <BR><BR>In 1995 the capital market for domestic issuers was again dominated by thestrong presence of the public sector. The Swiss cantons and municipalitieswere more active than in the preceding year and convertibles and bonds withwarrants launched by large corporates met with an excellent reception. However,the tax burden on new issues (stamp duty and withholding tax), has causedmany Swiss corporate issuers to borrow in the foreign bond segment (vianon-Swiss issuing vehicles). The Swiss treasury estimates the confederation'sgross funding requirements for 1996 to be around Swfr5 billion. Swfr3.5billion of this is still to be issued, and will be distributed over fivepayments during the year. However, in view of the government's substantialliquid reserves, 1996 could mirror 1995, when just 55% of the announcedSwfr4.5 billion gross funding requirement was taken up. <BR><BR><B><I>The foreign bond market</I></B> <BR><BR>In 1995 the Swiss franc was the fourth largest borrowing currency worldwide.The biggest issuers in the Swiss market in 1995 were state agencies (42%),followed by banks (21%), and corporates (19%), normally with an A ratingor better. The Swiss market, which is predominantly retail- oriented, ishighly receptive for household names. <BR><BR>The Swiss franc has consistently offered the lowest long-term interest ratesin the Western hemisphere. Even after netting out Swiss currency appreciationversus weaker currencies, break-even calculations show that in many casesa long-term borrowing in Swiss francs could have been cheaper than borrowingin dollars or in other European currencies. As a consequence, many largeborrowers have a substantial part of their foreign debt in Swiss francs.Furthermore, a Swiss franc issue can often generate cheaper funds througha currency swap than a financing operation done directly in the desiredcurrency. The name of a specific issuer often gets a better reception inSwitzerland than in the country of the target currency. Therefore, lowercost of funding is possible through a hedged Swiss franc issue. <BR><BR>The many types of investors in the Swiss market, ranging from individualsto large institutions, allow for a broad spectrum of borrowers. As Switzerlandis a typical retail market, investors' preferences are often different tothose in the Eurobond market, where institutional investors are dominant.In 1995, the bulk of issuers were from Germany (20%), Japan (17%) and Austria(14%). As a comparison, in 1993 Japanese borrowers represented 35% of allnew issues, while the Austrians and Scandinavians each had an 11% share.<H3>Underwriting, listing &amp; trading </H3>The placement of a bond issue is usually made by a bank or a group of banksunderwriting the securities on a firm basis. Transactions launched on abest-effort basis are rare. For monetary policy and supervision purposes,the Swiss National Bank has adhered to the rule that only a bank whose domicileis Switzerland, regardless of whether it is under Swiss or foreign control,is eligible as lead-manager in the Swiss franc primary market. This rulehas ensured that no Euro-Swiss franc bond market has been created outsideSwitzerland. However, since April 1 1993, the other syndicate members ina Swiss franc issue by an international borrower are no longer requiredto be based in Switzerland. In addition, the Swiss stamp tax on new issuesby foreign borrowers in Switzerland was lifted on the same date. <BR><BR>Listing on the stock exchange of Zurich and, in some cases, in Basle andGeneva, is usual for public bond issues. The listing procedure is straightforwardand is handled by the lead-manager. <BR><BR>Investors in Switzerland can make use of a highly developed infrastructureand a large number of secondary market specialists. Switzerland currentlyhas three stock exchanges, of which the Zurich stock exchange is by farthe largest. The full introduction of the electronic exchange trading system(Elektronische B&ouml;rse Schweiz, or EBS), currently taking place, marksan important change for Swiss and international market participants. Oncefully implemented, EBS will enable continuous trading of all products and,most importantly, will lead to an increase in trading liquidity by mergingthe current regional stock exchanges into one electronic exchange. <BR><BR>In line with foreign derivatives markets, the Swiss market has developedrapidly in recent years. The Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange(SOFFEX), the first fully electronic derivatives market in the world, startedtrading in 1988. At a later stage, the trading division of SOFFEX will beintegrated into the new electronic exchange trading system, creating a tradingorganization with one common technical platform. With the planned introductionof the new Swiss federal exchange law, the previous cantonal exchange lawsbecome obsolete. The supervision over the stock exchange will move overto the federal banking commission when the Swiss federal exchange law becomeseffective. <BR><BR>Immediately after the launch of a new issue, bonds may be traded in theprimary market. In Switzerland, the primary market is formally defined asthe place where securities are traded from the time of launch until oneday before the end of the subscription period, ie for about two to threeweeks. <BR><BR>The top 15 bonds in turnover are government bonds. These account for 50%of domestic bond market volume and are considered benchmarks on the domesticside. Other highly liquid bonds include the European Investment Bank, theKingdom of Denmark and the Republic of Austria, all of which are Swfr1 billionissues, and are considered benchmarks for foreign bonds along with the swapcurve. Yields are expressed on a 30/360 basis and coupons are computed annually.<H3>Outlook </H3>Prices on the Swfr bond market, as in other markets, rose continually in1995. The yield on 10-year confederation bonds dropped from over 5.2% tobelow 4%. One of the main reasons for lower interest rates is weak economicgrowth. The lower demand for cash, moderate growth in money supply, andlow inflation allowed the Swiss National Bank to pursue a considerably moreexpansive monetary policy in 1995. The discount rate was reduced in foursteps from 3.5% to 1.5% - a level not seen since 1979. Money market ratestherefore fell even more sharply than capital market rates last year, resultingin a relatively steep yield curve. <BR><BR>In 1995 the Swiss franc gained further strength (trade-weighted, it appreciatedby 6%). Against the leading currencies, $, Dm and Yen, it advanced 12%,4.5% and 7% respectively. <BR><BR>Since spring 1995, GDP growth has dropped dramatically and is currentlybelow its long-term potential of 2%. The deteriorating business climatekept unemployment at an uncharacteristically high 4% and increased fearsof further job losses. Because of stagnating real disposable income andcautious government spending, the best scenario to be expected in 1996 isa weak economic recovery. In the current low interest rate environment,investors will probably remain hesitant about committing themselves to longmaturities. With a potential for a rate upswing in the second half of theyear, the new issues market should be less active than in 1995. However,to some extent the Swiss franc will probably retain its role of safe-havenand diversification currency, and the Swiss bond market will continue tobenefit from this. <P><BR><BR>For moreinformation, please contact: <BR><BR>Peter H.

Ltd.</H4><H3>A PROMISING FUTURE </H3>When referring to Switzerland as a financial centre, what is often meantis the unique position that Switzerland has long held in the world of privatebanking. This history deserves a brief review, since it is relevant to Switzerland'scurrent status as an international financial centre. Equally important toglobal investors, however, is the future development of <I>Finanzplatz Schweiz</I>and the comparative advantages it will offer private and institutional investors.<H3>PRIVATE BANKING </H3>The leadership position Swiss private banking enjoys today was not achievedby mere circumstance. Rather, it arose out of a number of different factors:<BR><BR><B><I>Factors which built leadership </I></B><BR><BR>1) The first crucial factor in Switzerland's leadership position was itsunconstrained openness towards its European neighbours, manifested by itsmulticultural society and the four languages spoken within its narrow borders.<BR><BR>2) A second factor derives from the country's relatively small size andlack of natural resources, which encouraged the Swiss to look beyond theirnational borders and cultivate business relationships with foreign merchants.<BR><BR>3) A third factor is the confidentiality desired by the wealthy; a needwhich Swiss financial institutions have always been capable of meeting.Today, Switzerland's banking secrecy laws guarantee investors confidentialityand security. Other countries, such as Luxembourg, France or Austria, havenow also made the violation of banking secrecy laws a punishable offence,but in Switzerland banking secrecy is particularly stringent. Swiss bankingsecrecy is not intended to serve as a barrier to criminal investigationsbut as protection for people who have accumulated investment assets throughentirely legitimate means. <BR><BR>4) A fourth factor is Switzerland's political stability and long-standingneutrality. Foreign investors, whose assets were often imperilled by politicalupheaval, warfare or runaway inflation, often saw Switzerland as a financialsafe haven, where their assets were managed reliably and professionally.<BR><BR>5) Finally, there is the quality of financial services offered by Switzerland.Quality has since become an important criterion by which international financialcentres are measured. A recently published study by London-based propertycompany Healey &amp; Baker confirms that Swiss employees are ranked amongthe best in Europe with regard to quality. Fluency in several languages,for instance, is just one advantage when dealing with a Swiss investmentadvisor. <BR><BR>Because of the above factors, as well as the strong Swiss currency and thecountry's historically stable macroeconomic conditions, Switzerland hasbecome a major financial centre. An estimated 35% to 40% of all foreign-managedassets, or Swfr2,000 billion to Swfr2,500 billion, are managed in Switzerland.Maintaining leadership is a challenging task in today's highly competitiveenvironment. The needs and desires of both domestic and foreign clientshave to be constantly clarified and competently addressed, and servicescontinuously tailored to these ever-changing requirements. <H3>INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS </H3>Financial services specifically designed to accommodate the needs of institutionalinvestors did not emerge until the mid-1980s, but have since grown to becomeone of the major segments within the financial services market. The aggregatetotal of pension fund assets alone is likely to grow to $12,000 billionby the year 2000. This development has given rise to a vast array of productsfor institutions, offered as an all-in-one or tailor-made service . <BR><BR>The preferences and valuation criteria of institutional investors differfrom those of private individuals on a number of points: Institutions areinterested, for instance, in well-organized and efficient stock exchanges,a modern framework and an attractive macro-economic and micro-economic environment.<BR><BR>Unfortunately, Switzerland used to be handicapped by a number of structuraldeficiencies which provided other financial centres, such as Luxembourgor London, with a competitive advantage. One particular disadvantage wasSwitzerland's stamp duty, which considerably increased the cost of stock-markettransactions and encouraged investors to take their business elsewhere.This deprived Swiss exchanges of several billion francs worth of turnoverevery year. Laws regulating Swiss investment funds were also highly restrictiveuntil very recently, inducing both Swiss and foreign banks to establishand operate fund companies in Luxembourg or other offshore centres, ratherthan in Switzerland. Switzerland's open outcry system and the fragmentedstructure of three cantonal exchanges in Zurich, Basel and Geneva, wereneither modern nor competitive. <BR><BR>Influential leaders from Swiss political, business and stock exchange circleswere realizing where the financial world was heading and worked togetherto come up with several important innovations. <BR><BR>One major area involved legislative modifications to improve investmentconditions in Switzerland. Another big project is the Elektronische B&ouml;rseSchweiz (EBS), a screen-based trading system which will bring about majorimprovements for investors. These efforts, along with Switzerland's favourablemacroeconomic environment and interesting microeconomic developments, willmake Finanzplatz Schweiz even more attractive in the next few years. Thisshould encourage more and more international investors to do business inSwitzerland. <H3>IMPROVEMENTS </H3><B><I>Legal developments</I></B> <BR><BR>Switzerland's new securities law, which went into effect in 1992, providesgreater protection for shareholders and has also increased transparency.As a result, the attractiveness of investing in Swiss equities has beengreatly enhanced. Since then, important amendments have been made. For instance,companies are prohibited from arbitrarily refusing to enter registered shareholdersin their registrar. <BR><BR>A new investment fund law, conforming to EU directives, was enacted on January1 1995. This new law gives Swiss fund managers greater leeway with regardto options, securities lending, leverage and short selling. Newly createdfund categories ('other fund' and 'other fund with increased risk'), enablea greater differentiation of fund strategies and thus broaden the rangeof Swiss funds from which investors can choose. <BR><BR>The new stock exchange law will tentatively come into effect in July 1996and the new listing regulations in January 1997. Both are designed to improveshareholders' rights and the transparency of the Swiss stock market. <BR><BR>The stock exchange law represents a significant improvement in the rightsof minority shareholders: major shareholders must notify both the companyand the stock exchange authorities once their interest in a company exceedsor falls below a certain level. In addition, a public offer has to be madeto all shareholders once a single investor owns more than 33% of votingrights. <BR><BR>New listing regulations will require companies to present their accountsaccording to ARR guidelines (Swiss accounting and reporting recommendations),which correspond to true and fair principles. ARR guidelines are compatiblewith accounting and disclosure standards established by the EU. <BR><BR>From an investor's point of view, they go even further than EU directives,since they will require companies to provide a detailed funds flow statement.Thus the numerous companies which have already voluntarily adopted ARR guidelinesalso comply with the 4th and 7th EU directives. The flow of informationwill improve further in June 1998, when companies will be required to publishan interim report. <BR><BR><B><I>Swiss Electronic Exchange</I></B> <BR><BR>The Swiss Electronic Exchange (EBS) was long awaited, much criticized and,some claimed, doomed to fail from the outset. However, it got off to a successfulstart. On December 8 1995, screen-based trading in non-Swiss equities andrelated options went on-line and the fully automated exchange system functionedwithout any major problems. <BR><BR>In the second phase, Swiss equities will be transferred to the electronicexchange. Major organizational change will occur when the three Swiss stockexchanges Zurich, Basle and Geneva merge into a single Swiss Exchange. Thiswill increase liquidity and make investments in the Swiss market more attractive.Market activities will be subject to new regulations. <BR><BR><B><I>Rapid and fair execution of all orders</I></B> <BR><BR>Once EBS is fully operational, all securities will be traded permanentlyfrom 9:30am to 4:30pm without interruption. This means that in future itwill be possible to buy and sell second-tier stocks at all times. Theseare currently traded only twice a day. The new electronic exchange providesfor some new types of orders that complement the trading instruments availableto traders and investors. <BR><BR>The electronic exchange guarantees equal opportunity for all market participants.The system operates according to a clearly defined price/time priority forthe execution of orders, regardless of their size. First, all at-best ordersare carried out, followed by the highest bid or lowest ask price, respectively,with priority given to the orders which have been in the system the longestwhen entered prices are equivalent. <BR><BR>A solution to the problem of odd lots was found by combining them into roundlots which are then traded at the reference price. Sizing of round lotshas been simplified, making the minimum more accessible to retail investors.<BR><BR>Unlike the London Stock Exchange, where prices are quoted by official brokersonly, EBS operates on the basis of an order-driven system. Supply and demandare determined by price, not by market-makers. Market-making within EBSmerely serves to support market depth and improve liquidity. <BR><BR><B><I>Efficiency of exchange organization and reporting</I></B> <BR><BR>Swiss stock exchanges used to suffer from a lack of transparency and incompleteinformation, compared with other international exchanges. The launch ofEBS and the new exchange regulations which will now take effect, will eliminatethis competitive disadvantage. <BR><BR>Article 7 of the exchange regulations stipulates that members are obligedto make all transactions on the electronic exchange system during tradinghours. Exceptions are dealt with in Directive 3, which regulates the sizeof orders that may be traded off-exchange. <BR><BR>In adherence to the principle of best execution, a client may at any timeask the bank which carried out the transaction to verify whether an off-exchangeexecution produced a more favourable price than trading via the EBS. <BR><BR>According to Directive 10, exchange members now have to report off-exchangetransactions within 30 minutes or, for transactions conducted outside tradinghours, by the next start of trading at the latest. In its trading statementthe bank must designate all transactions not done via the matcher as off-exchangetransactions. <BR><BR>With this new regulation, investors have an effective means of protectingtheir investments, significantly improving transparency and making it impossibleto by-pass the official electronic trading system. <BR><BR>An elaborate form of self-regulation guarantees that EBS is adequately supervised.The new federal law on securities trading empowers the federal banking commissionto supervise the exchange. <BR><BR>Thanks to the utilization of high-tech trading methods, the supervisorybodies are equipped with innovative and effective monitoring tools. Theauthorities have instant access to the order book for each security and,if necessary, can reconstruct any unusual movements in the market step-by-step.<BR><BR>A special stock-watch programme was designed to detect sudden price changesand/or conspicuous fluctuations in volume, and will enable supervisory staffto take immediate action. The aim of these innovations is to ensure a fairand orderly market as well as provide all participants with access to up-to-dateinformation. <BR><BR><B><I>Timely and faultless clearing and settlement</I></B> <BR><BR>A Swiss exchange brochure states that: &quot;In 1993 a new milestone wasreached in the settlement of exchange transactions.&quot; It refers to theelectronic clearing system for Swiss securities (SECOM), which has enabledSwitzerland to take a leading international position in clearing and settlementprocedures. <BR><BR>Linked to EBS's fully electronic matching system, the SEGA communicationsystem permits clearing of market transactions on the value date set bythe exchange. The pre-matching procedure operated by SECOM provides theback office with details of individual transactions prior to the actualsettlement date. Input errors can therefore be detected and rectified atan early stage, which ensures settlement within the usual three days afterclosing. As securities are transferred on the settlement date, payment ismade automatically, at the same time, via Swiss Interbank Clearing (SIC).Investors will certainly appreciate these advantages and do more and moreof their trading through the Swiss exchange. <BR><BR>The successful launch of EBS does not mean, however, that the developmentand improvement of Switzerland's financial centre has been completed. Itis in fact just the starting point for an ongoing process of refinement.<BR><BR>With the realization of EBS, as well as the legal and regulatory amendmentsmade in the run-up, the member banks of the Swiss Exchange have forged anexcellent basis for improving the services provided to their clients. Highly-skilledtraders and client-oriented investment advisors are the pillars on whichthe improvements will rest, along with the role played by a rapid transmissionof information to and from the exchange. <H3>MACROECONOMICS </H3><B><I>Moderate growth at low interest rates</I></B> <BR><BR>Expectations of rapid economic growth accompanied by a high rate of inflationsent bond and stock markets on a downward spiral in 1994. This pessimisticsentiment vanished in 1995. Economic activity generally remained moderatein 1994, with GDP growth at 4.1% in the US, 0.5% in Japan and 2.9% in WesternEurope, and even sagged in 1995, with the exception of Japan. Accordingto provisional estimates by Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and theCentre for Research of Economic Activity, Switzerland's GDP growth in 1995weakened to 0.4%. Consequently, many economic forecasters no longer speakof a resurgence in inflation, but instead are warning of possible deflation,which would knock the Swiss economy into a recession. <BR><BR>It is now projected that real GDP will grow at a modest rate of between1% and 2% in 1996 and 1997. Most GDP components will post only modest increasesin the next two years. Private consumption will be subdued in 1996, as itwas in 1995. Due to uncertain job security and only marginally higher disposableincomes, private consumption is expected to expand by only 1% in real termsin 1996. An acceleration can be expected no earlier than the beginning of1997. Construction activity is unlikely to contribute to GDP growth duringthe next two years either, since there is still a large supply of unoccupiedproperties in the commercial and residential real estate markets. Bank Vontobelexpects that construction activity will remain flat during the next twoyears. <BR><BR>Growth will be sustained once again by domestic capital spending and exports.The disadvantages faced by Swiss companies competing in foreign markets,due to the strong Swiss franc, have forced these firms to modernize andrationalize their production facilities. This, in turn, gives Swiss companiesa technological lead which is expected to raise exports by around 5% inreal terms during the next two years. A two- to four-year postponement ofEuropean monetary union would be particularly beneficial for Switzerland'sexport and tourism industries. The Swiss franc would weaken against theGerman mark, since German investors would no longer be rushing to park theirfunds in Swiss francs. In addition, investors would most likely close speculativepositions that have given the Swiss franc's upward trend an extra boost.<BR><BR>The difficulties encountered by Swiss companies due to a strong domesticcurrency are clearly evident when looking at the development of foreignexchange rates for 15 major currencies in the past six years. During thisperiod the value of the Swiss franc has risen by 25% (approx. 4% pa). Thefranc's appreciation against the dollar is even more dramatic, as the realdollar/franc exchange rate was 41% lower at the end of 1989 than it is now,corresponding to a 6% annual rise in value for the Swiss franc. <BR><BR>The effect on business is that Swiss firms have been forced to substantiallyincrease productivity while slash-ing costs, just to offset the adverseeffects of a strong domestic currency and to remain competitive in internationalmarkets. <BR><BR>With moderate growth rates and poor consumer sentiment, Swiss inflationshould recede further. Despite the uptick attributable to the introductionof a value-added tax system, last year's rate of inflation was less than2% (annualized average: 1.8%). A continued decline in inflation to 0.4%is expected in 1996, with a slight upturn in 1997 to 1.0%. The downwardtrend of the consensus inflation forecast shows that inflationary expectationsfor 1996 were originally far too high. In March 1995 the consensus figurefor average inflation in 1996 came to 2.0%, which was then steadily reviseddownward to the 1.14% figure published in December 1995. This is still wellabove Bank Vontobel's estimate. The inflation estimate of 0.4% for 1996is based on the following three points: firstly, the absence of last year'sVAT effect reduces inflationary pressure; secondly, lower food prices dueto downward price pressure from cheaper imported goods and the intensifyingstruggle among retail distributors for market share; and thirdly, housingrents will hardly go up because of the large supply of unoccupied housingand falling mortgage rates. <BR><BR>Although the Swiss National Bank (SNB) reduced its key rates several timesduring 1995, bringing them to their current historical low of 1.5%, moneysupply expanded by only an estimated 0.7%, rather than the 2% target setby the SNB. It is unlikely that SNB will have any reason to reverse itsmonetary course this year. <BR><BR>Although Bank Vontobel did forecast at the beginning of 1995 that interestrates would be falling in congruence with the bank's inflation expectations,the extent of the subsequent interest rate decline did take the bank bysurprise. The average yield of government bonds tumbled by around 150 basispoints to 3.7%, and three-month Swfr Eurorates fell from around 4.5% toroughly 1.75%. The bank believes that current interest rates are not a signof market overshooting and expects a volatile sideways trend at both thelong and short end during the next 12 months. <H3>STOCK MARKET </H3><B><I>Will the show go on?</I></B> <BR><BR>In terms of volume, the Swiss stock market, with a turnover of approximatelySwfr374 billion in 1995, ranks sixth worldwide and third in Europe, behindLondon and Frankfurt. This is no doubt attributable in part to the market'soutstanding performance. <BR><BR>1995 was an exceptionally good year for the Swiss stock market. The totalmarket posted a 23% rise in Swiss francs, a performance exceeded by onlyone other market - Wall Street. Expressed in dollars, however, Swiss equitieswere last year's best performer, posting a 40% rise in value. A carefulanalysis of the stock market's performance shows that investors were notat all caught up in a euphorically bullish sentiment, despite the headyprice gains. Investors last year snapped up shares in those companies pursuinga focused strategy backed up by concrete actions. Index gains thereforestemmed primarily from a handful of heavily capitalized stocks, such asSandoz, Swiss Re and Alusuisse. Blue chips advanced 25% compared to a declineof around 1% for the small-cap segment. <BR><BR>Following this outstanding performance in 1995, several global investmentbanks have advised their clients to reduce their exposure to Swiss equitiesand cash in on last year's fat profits. Another strong surge in prices atthe start of this year was followed by a correction, above all by thosestocks which had made big gains last year. These volatile swings have mademany investors wary and uncertain. <BR><BR>There are three things which investors should consider when looking at theSwiss market: <BR><BR>Firstly, the earnings outlook for listed Swiss companies remains good. Thisyear Bank Vontobel estimates that earnings will grow by an average 18% following1995's average 13% increase. <BR><BR>Secondly, in comparison with the expected yields on Swiss-franc bonds ofaround 4.13%, Swiss stocks are attractively valued at 13.6 times estimated1997 earnings (earnings yield: 7.3%). <BR><BR>And thirdly, rather than being euphorically bullish, the attitude of foreignand domestic investors regarding exposure to Swiss equities has been markedby caution, which is reflected in the market's relatively high risk premium.<BR><BR>Taking into account these three points, the bank believes the outlook forthe market's performance in 1996 is good. Investors should pay special attentionto the small-cap segment, which has underperformed the market by a widemargin (-1% versus +25% in 1995) and, measured by all standard valuationindicators, is currently trading at a slight discount to the total market.<BR><BR>For more information, please contact: <BR><BR>Hanspeter Lutz <BR>Chief strategist 41 1 283 73 61 <BR><BR>ChristophLedergeber <BR>Head of sales 41 1 283 56 94 <BR><BR>Thomas Pfyl <BR>Head of research 41 1 283 73 70 <BR><BR><B>Bahnhofstrasse 3, <BR>CH-8022 Z&uuml;rich</B> <p></td></tr></table><br><nobr><a href="em.96.03.27.index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Back a Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt1.gif" alt="Back"></a><a href="../../../../../services/faqs.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Help';return true"><img width=22 height=22 hspace=90 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt2.gif" alt="Help"></a><a href="#top" onMouseOver="window.status='Top of the Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt3.gif" alt="Top"></a></nobr><br><br><nobr><a href="../../../../../alert/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='ALERT - Discussion Groups, Latest News, Site Updates, Sponsors and Events Diary';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav1.gif" alt="Alert"></a><a href="../../../../../search/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SEARCH - Keyword and Structured Searches';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav2.gif" alt="Search"></a><a href="../../../../../services/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SERVICES - FAQs, Feedback, Problems and EMWL Team';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav3.gif" alt="Services"></a><a href="../../../../../contents/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='CONTENTS - Publications, World Map, Product Sections and Data';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav44.gif" alt="Contents"></a></nobr></font><br><br><font size=2>All material subject to strictly enforced copyright laws. 1996&copy; <a href="MAILTO:pbrady@pobox.com">Euromoney Publications PLC.</a></font><br></center></body></html>

Swiss securities are included in any significantinternational investment portfolio and volumes from overseas investors continueto increase. Switzerland has the third-largest equity market in Europe witha market capitalization in 1995 of over Swfr458.6 billion and a turnoverof approximately Swfr374 billion for domestic equities. <BR><BR>Over the past five years the Swiss market has undergone tremendous changesand its market participants can now take full advantage of one of the world'sleading technically-advanced infrastructures. Today, the Swiss financialnetwork electronically links SOFFEX (The Swiss Options and Financial FuturesExchange), EBS (Electronic Stock Exchange), SECOM (SEGA communication system),SIC (Swiss interbank clearing) and Telekurs (market information provider),thereby increasing the liquidity and transparency of the market and reducingsettlement risk to a minimum. These developments could only be achievedthrough extraordinary cooperation between the leading Swiss financial institutionsand the longsightedness of the federal and cantonal bodies. <BR><BR>Standardized options and futures, ranging from options on individual sharesand index-linked options to index- and interest-linked futures contracts,are traded on SOFFEX, which started in 1988 and ranks amongst the leadingEuropean derivatives exchanges. Trading and clearing are fully integratedand automated. <BR><BR>EBS commenced the first phase of its operations with the trading of foreignequities on December 8 1995. It is a computerized and continuous order-driventrading system, replacing the existing exchange floors of the three regionalexchanges (Zurich, Basle and Geneva) and assuming their central tasks. Thenext phases will occur later in 1996. The floors will finally cease to existwhen the remaining products are also traded through EBS. The electronicexchange will enable all market participants to have access to a centralpricing mechanism and order size will be visible via computer screen. Aswas the case under the old open outcry system, the investors still placetheir orders with a bank, and in this respect the new electronic exchangedoes not affect them. Nevertheless, the investor is indirectly affectedby numerous changes such as new trading hours (from 9:30am to 4:30pm) andcompulsory trading of small and middle-sized transactions. For investors,the main advantage of EBS is a fairer market due to the increased transparencywhich results from the continuous reporting of prices as well as volumes.These changes will not only lead to a greater flexibility in the operationof the Swiss stock exchange, but, above all, to greater efficiency in theback offices. <BR><BR>With the introduction of EBS, settlement on a rolling basis of trade dateplus zero becomes a technical possibility. On the completion of automatictrade matching on EBS, settlement in SEGA takes place without separate settlementinstructions from the respective EBS members. SEGA, the Swiss securitiesclearing corporation, was founded in 1970 as a joint undertaking by Swissbanks, with the patronage of the Swiss Bankers Association. The companyis owned by some 160 Swiss banks and no one bank possesses a majority stake.SEGA provides for collective custody of eligible Swiss securities and forclearing services. Securities are immobilized and change of ownership takesplace through a book-entry system. Custody, clearing and settlement-relatedpayments are made via electronic link to SIC, which is operated by Telekurs,owned by the Swiss banks and guaranteed by the Swiss National Bank. <H3>CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT </H3>On a consolidated level, the securities industry has, for a number of years,been using the nine recommendations on <BR><BR>clearing and settlement, issued by the Group of Thirty as a benchmark forthe service quality offered by a national market as a whole. <BR><BR>At the time the recommendations were published in 1989, Switzerland wasin the comfortable position of already meeting six out of the followingnine recommendations: <BR><BR>*Trade comparison for direct market participants <BR><BR>*Trade comparison for indirect market participants <BR><BR>*Central securities depository <BR><BR>*Trade netting system <BR><BR>*Delivery versus payment <BR><BR>*Same day funds <BR><BR>*Rolling settlement <BR><BR>*Securities lending and borrowing <BR><BR>*International securities identification number (ISIN) and other ISO securitystandards. <BR><BR>Today, Switzerland meets all but recommendation number two, that is, tradecomparison for indirect participants. This is due to the prevailing Swissmarket practice of banks acting as principal (for their own account), asan effective contracting party and as a member of the stock exchange. <BR><BR>In a series of international conferences organized by the InternationalSociety of Securities Administrators (ISSA) last year, 35 national marketstook the opportunity to present status reports about their compliance withthe G-30 recommendations. Switzerland's report demonstrated forcefully thatthe very substantial joint-efforts of the Swiss securities industry weredirected towards reducing settlement risk and improving the efficiency ofmarket systems and procedures. With EBS and SECOM/SIC, Switzerland now hasone of the most advanced and integrated trading, clearing and settlementinfrastructures in the world. True, irrevocable real-time simultaneous exchangeof securities and cash on a transaction-by-transaction basis takes place.<BR><BR>The G-30 status updates were an outcome of the ISSA conferences. The mainpurpose of ISSA's G-30 review was to amend the original recommendations,where appropriate, in order to reflect today's market demands more accurately.Some of the benchmarks were set higher. Switzerland once again meets mostof the more stringent criteria, which ultimately benefits investors. Apartfrom EBS, the SEGA communications system SECOM, which has replaced the oldSEGA system, is the key factor for this achievement. <BR><BR>Via SECOM, clearing and settlement with SEGA/Intersettle and its participantsin Switzerland and abroad is effected by electronic book entry which ison-line and real-time. Users can trace the current status of settlementand payment transactions almost 24 hours a day. The unique simultaneousdelivery-versus-payment facility provides for risk-free settlement betweenparticipants, in that securities and cash are available and blocked beforethe matched transaction is irrevocably settled. The market deadline fordelivery-versus-payment instructions at SECOM/SIC is 2:00pm on value day.Free delivery instructions for same-day settlement can be input into theSECOM system up until the start of the end-of-day processing at 7:00pm.This procedure pertains to all SEGA-eligible securities, which include bearerand registered shares, bonds, listed mutual funds, rights etc. The settlementof Swiss registered securities is usually not influenced by the registrationprocess. <BR><BR>However, since the process required to complete registration varies fromcompany to company based on their specific and individual by-laws, the foreigninvestor may have some questions on this topic which deserves further explanationin the next section. <H3>SWISS REGISTERED SHARES </H3>On July 1 1992 the current shareholders' rights law came into effect. Theregistered share market was liberalized and general sales restrictions regardingforeign investors were lifted. <BR><BR><B><I>Shareholders' rights</I></B> <BR><BR>When investing in registered shares quoted on the Swiss stock exchange,the investor buys not only the ownership of the security, but also the associatedrights. Listed companies can no longer block the transfer of these rightsto investors and on the correct lodgement of a registration form must acceptthe shareholder with rights and obligations. However, some companies' articlesof association may still limit the type of shareholder or the percentageof equity per shareholder. Should the company refuse full acceptance ofthe investor, they will be registered as a &quot;shareholder without votingright&quot;, but still receive the dividend and right to participate incorporate actions. Communications on voting eligibility are directed tothe shareholder by the company. <BR><BR><B><I>Settlement procedures</I></B> <BR><BR>In the past, all registered shares were physically settled between investors,banks and the companies, who acted as their own registrar. However, in 1988SEGA introduced a new clearing facility for this type of share and it becamepossible for certain companies to settle their shares through SEGA. Today,depending on the company, there are three procedures by which stock exchangequoted registered shares can be settled. <BR><BR>The first and most common is delivery-versus-payment/book-entry settlementvia SEGA. On settlement of the transaction, the custodian bank sends registrationdocuments to the buyer for due completion, and the completed documents arethen lodged with the company by the custodian. The shares remain in SEGAthroughout the registration process (See diagram on page 18). <BR><BR>The second settlement procedure is basically the same as the first. However,the shares are physically held by the custodian and the selling shareholder'sname has to be removed from the company's register before settlement isarranged. After settlement and registration formalities, share certificatesare forwarded to the custodian bank for safekeeping. <BR><BR>The third method is for the few remaining non-SEGA-eligible registered shares,which are all physically settled via the company registrar. The shares arekept by the custodian bank. <BR><BR>It is important to note that registered shares which have been purchasedbut not duly registered can be sold at any time, regardless of the registrationstatus. <BR><BR><B><I>Registration process</I></B> <BR><BR>Investors should duly complete and return the form to the custodian bank,usually within 20 working days of receipt. If the custodian does not receivethe investor's reply within this period, a reminder is usually sent. Ifthe reply is still not forthcoming after a further period of time, custodianswill continue to hold the shares in unregistered form. However, the sharescan still be registered at a later date, when a duly completed registrationform is received. Voting rights may not be exercised until completed registrationforms have been lodged and accepted by each individual company. <BR><BR>Furthermore, Swiss corporation law mandates that registrars have 20 daysto respond to registration requests otherwise they are considered to begranted. <BR><BR><B><I>Registration names</I></B> <BR><BR>Usually companies require their shares to be registered in the name of thebeneficial owner, though some companies may have a special nominee arrangementand will allow registration in fiduciary names. The nominee can either bea person or a company and is usually accepted with voting rights if theyare prepared to give details such as beneficial owner's name, nationality,place of domicile and number of shares. <BR><BR>Shares can also be held in a &quot;disposable position&quot;, which meansthat the shares are held at the company at the disposal of the custodianon a client's behalf. If the investor does not complete the registrationform within the required time-frame, the securities are recorded as beingin a disposable position at the custodian bank and at the company register.The custodian is not obliged to disclose names/details of the investor tothe company. The investor retains the right to receive a dividend, but forfeitsvoting rights. <BR><BR>Market participants are looking at the existing practice of each Swiss companyhaving its own registration form and the associated administration formalitiesin the market. A new development is a standardized one-time applicationfor a registration form, which will also include a power of attorney. Ifthis form is deemed acceptable by Swiss companies, the investor will onlyneed to complete and sign it the one time and their custodian will be ableto automatically register any further purchases of shares. However, to dateonly a few Swiss companies have given their consent to use this form. <BR><BR>With the present integration of all but a very few listed shares into theSEGA clearing system, and the growing automatic exchange of data betweencustodians and the companies, the handling of Swiss registered shares inthe near future will be more transparent to foreign investors. <H3>CUSTODY </H3><B><I>Collection of entitlements</I></B> <BR><BR>The Swiss market does not usually differentiate between the ex-date andthe payable date; they are the same, with very rare exceptions. The custodianreceives the dividend/interest funds either from the principal agent orfrom SEGA, if the securities are re-deposited there. Swiss custodians usuallycredit clients' cash accounts under re-serve, with income and good value,that is, dividends and interest due on securities held in the clients safe-custodyaccount/s on the payable date. The same principle applies to the redemptionof bonds and notes on their expiration date. Professional Swiss custodiansalso offer a dividend claim service. This will be supported by a futureSEGA development, whereby automatic dividend payments will be made for cum-dividendtransactions within a certain period of time after ex-date. Based on thetrade date, the dividend for the seller will be cancelled and the buyerwill be credited with the dividend. <BR><BR><B><I>Tax reclamation</I></B> <BR><BR>In Switzerland a tax of 35% is automatically levied on all income from dividendsand interest on Swiss securities, with no relief at source. Interest onSwiss franc bonds issued internationally (Eurobonds), is generally not subjectto withholding tax. The withholding tax is not related to the nature anddomicile of the beneficial owner's securities, nor is it legally or operationallylinked to ownership of the cash account. The reclaiming of this tax is dependenton the tax treaty concluded between Switzerland and the domicile of thebeneficial owner. As a rule, the tax relief takes the form of a refund.<BR><BR>Tax returns must be signed by the beneficial owner or his representative.The forms used are defined under the current double taxation treaties betweenSwitzerland and the domicile country of the beneficial owner. Due to thisprocess, claimants generally file the appropriate refund claim forms directlywith the Swiss federal tax administration in Berne. The reclaiming timeperiod is within three years from the end of the calendar year in whichthe income was received. Refunds for more than one year may be claimed onthe same form. Claims are usually dealt with by the Swiss tax administrationwithin three to six months of being lodged. The Swiss tax authorities willonly remit a cheque to claimants who do not hold a cash account with a Swissbank. <BR><BR><B><I>Corporate actions</I></B> <BR><BR>In Switzerland the most common corporate actions are capital increases,bonus issues, stock splits, stock option/cash dividends and conversion ofbonds. On the official announcement date of a corporate action, the custodianbank provides its clients with information such as an announcement date,a description of the action and restrictions, entitled share positions,response deadlines and taxes or deductions that may apply. Corporate actionsare executed according to clients' instructions. The rights claim processis similar to the dividend claim process, and in the future will be supportedby the SEGA development mentioned under entitlements for cum-dividend transactions.<BR><BR><B><I>Proxy voting</I></B> <BR><BR>Swiss companies have to announce details on annual general shareholders'and/or any other extraordinary meetings at least 20 days before the meeting.Custodians in turn advise investors of the meetings. The official publicationwith full agenda/proposals is mostly in the company's native language, ieGerman, French or Italian. Only in a few cases is it in English. Swiss custodianswith international institutional clients usually provide a short Englishtranslation with all the relevant information. <BR><BR>Market practice in Switzerland differentiates on the information flow forbearer and registered shares. Bearer shareholders receive the respectivedocumentation from their custodian bank. Registered shareholders receiveinformation direct from the company. However, as mentioned under the shareholders'rights section, until investors of registered shares have lodged a dulycompleted registration form and been fully recognized by the company, thevoting right cannot be exercised. Should the company refuse full acceptance,the investor will be registered as a &quot;shareholder without voting right&quot;,and will be directly advised of this fact by the company. <BR><BR>If bearer shareholders cannot personally attend the shareholders' meeting,they can give their proxy vote to their custodian bank, or to the officialindependent proxy representative. <H3>CONCLUSION </H3>After the steps taken by the Swiss financial community over the past fewyears, 1996 will be a year of consolidation and system optimization. Dueto all these achievements, Switzerland will be in an excellent positionto meet the ever increasing demands of the professional international investor.<BR><BR>The Swiss market is one of the best organized, and also has the flexibilityto cope with the ongoing developments in various current and future financialproducts, as well as the related communication needs. Therefore Switzerlandwill undoubtedly confirm its traditional leading position in the cross-borderinvestment streams. <BR><B>Union Bank of Switzerland</B> <BR><BR><B>Bahnhofstrasse 45 <BR><BR>CH-8021 Zurich <BR><BR>Switzerland</B> <BR><BR><B>SWIFT: UBSWCHZH80A</B> <BR><BR><B>Telex: 813 811 UB CH <BR><BR>Custody servicesMarc R&uuml;ttimann <BR><BR>head of custody services</B> <BR><BR><B>Tel: +41 1 235 31 15</B> <BR><BR><B>Facsimile: +41 1 235 34 05 <BR><BR>Ronald Akkermans <BR><BR>head of relationship management</B> <BR><BR><B>Tel: +41 1 235 65 01</B> <BR><BR><B>Facsimile: +41 1 235 34 05</B> <BR><BR><B>Doris Rein <BR><BR>relationship manager</B> <BR><BR><B>Tel: +41 1 235 50 38 <BR><BR>Facsimile: +41 1 235 34 05 <BR><BR>Securities borrowing and lendingFelix Oegerli <BR><BR>head of securities lending and prime brokerage</B> <BR><BR><B>Tel: +41 1 235 61 04</B> <BR><BR><B>Facsimile: + 41 1 235 32 32 <BR><BR>Martin Schoenenberger <BR><BR>head of global marketing coordination</B> <BR><BR><B>Tel: +41 1 235 75 44</B> <BR><BR><B>Facsimile: +41 1 235 84 12 </B><p></td></tr></table><br><nobr><a href="em.96.03.27.index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Back a Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt1.gif" alt="Back"></a><a href="../../../../../services/faqs.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Help';return true"><img width=22 height=22 hspace=90 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt2.gif" alt="Help"></a><a href="#top" onMouseOver="window.status='Top of the Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt3.gif" alt="Top"></a></nobr><br><br><nobr><a href="../../../../../alert/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='ALERT - Discussion Groups, Latest News, Site Updates, Sponsors and Events Diary';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav1.gif" alt="Alert"></a><a href="../../../../../search/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SEARCH - Keyword and Structured Searches';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav2.gif" alt="Search"></a><a href="../../../../../services/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SERVICES - FAQs, Feedback, Problems and EMWL Team';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav3.gif" alt="Services"></a><a href="../../../../../contents/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='CONTENTS - Publications, World Map, Product Sections and Data';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav44.gif" alt="Contents"></a></nobr></font><br><br><font size=2>All material subject to strictly enforced copyright laws. 1996&copy; <a href="MAILTO:pbrady@pobox.com">Euromoney Publications PLC.</a></font><br></center></body></html>

<H4> The impact of reform is starting to show up in the economic statistics, but
major weaknesses remain </H4>

 <H3> Tiger in training </H3> 
 
 <P> <I>By Jon Marks</I> 
 
  <P> Structural reform is finally having a marked effect on the
economy. The question is whether this can create sustained growth and allow one
of the great under-achievers of the Arab world to mimic Asia's tiger economies.

<P> Key indicators certainly point to a much-improved performance:

<P> <li> A budget deficit cut to just 1.5% of GDP in 1994/95

<P> <li> Inflation down to about 8% by July, with government projections that in the
long term it can be reduced to 3%

<P> <li>  Growth rising: most donors and government officials agree that GDP, worth
E&#163;205 billion ($60 billion) in 1994/95, will grow by about 4.5%-5% this year
as a rebound in tourism supports an extended construction boom.

<P> With tiger-style growth of about 8% required to absorb some 500,000 new
entrants to the labour market each year, ministers are looking to increase
current investment levels of 17%-18% of GDP and savings levels of about 15%.

<P> According to Nawal el-Tatawi, minister of economy and international
co-operation: "To step up the growth rate, we have to increase investment to
something like 25% and hopefully... even higher."

<P> In the short term this means attracting foreign investment to fill in some
very weak links in the economy:

<P> <li> The trade gap was estimated by the state statistical agency CAPMAS at $8.3
billion last year, representing a widening of the deficit by over one-third as
imports rose from E&#163;34.5 billion to E&#163;39.9 billion. Exports proved
disappointing after a 48.5% surge in 1994/95. Non-oil sales rose by about 3% to
E&#163;7.58 billion, but the total fell from E&#163;11.7 billion. There will have
been some benefit from higher oil prices this year

<P> <li> Agriculture: the country remains one of the world's largest food importers.
It is able to grow only 45% of its wheat requirements. But agriculture is still
the most important sector of the economy, providing 32% of employment and 16.3%
of GDP in 1994/95.

<P> There is good news. Since the liberalisation drives of the mid-'80s, there
have been continuous gains in productivity. Much of the non-oil export growth
registered in 1994/95 was due to increased agricultural sales, notably potatoes,
rice and cotton. According to Tatawi: "It is likely in the medium term that our
competitive edge is greater in agriculture and agriculture-based products than in
manufacturing. I am sure the scope is much, much bigger than what we are already
doing."

<P> Liberalisation of the cotton industry last year offers the promise of an
increasing crop after a slump. The agriculture ministry estimated a 35% rise in
cotton yield and new exports.

<P> <li> Industry contributed about 17% of GDP in 1994/95 but growth has been
sluggish due to weak domestic demand and heavy public-sector debt. With profits
rising in private-sector industry, manufacturing growth is expected. But projects
to be presented at the MENA summit include only smaller high-tech schemes and the
proposed $1.5 billion expansion of Alexandria National Iron &amp; Steel Company.

<P> Higher world prices, good results from exploration and the dash for gas mean
the oil sector is booming. Despite an increase of 8.3% in domestic hydrocarbon
consumption, the oil trade surplus rose by 10.3% last year to $1.47 billion.
Crude oil production averaged 878,685 barrels a day (b/d) in 1995.

<P> Among other major revenue earners:

<P> <li> Suez Canal vessel usage fell by 8.1% to 15,051 in 1995, but the volume of
cargoes increased to 293 million tonnes and revenues rose 1.6% to $1.94 billion

<P> <li> Remittances from migrant workers remain a major source of foreign exchange,
with private transfers rising to $3.3 billion in 1995

<P> <li> Tourism income rose by 30% to a record $3 billion and the number of
visitors rose by 28% to 3.6 million in 1995/ 96. 

<P> Yet other forms of investment are now required so the economy can take off.
"We are interested in employment generation so some investments that are more
labour-intensive are welcome," Tatawi says. Regional development projects are
also urgently required.

<P> According to Tatawi: "We are interested in large investments that utilise
natural resources such as petroleum, natural gas, petrochemicals, cement and
fertilisers. Each kind of investment has its attractions, but we are definitely
looking to foreigners for the larger ones and for help in the most
technology-oriented investments."

<a href="wl.96.06.17.html"><H3> EGYPT </H3> </a>




<H4> The lengthening list of privatised companies has become a key indicator of
success for the reform programme </H4>

 <H3> Chalking up the menu </H3>
 
  <P>
<I>By Jon Marks</I> 

 <P> The Egyptian government and its critics are agreed:
privatisation has joined growth, deficits and other more traditional measures as
a key indicator of economic performance.

<P> "The fact that the Ganzouri government is so committed to privatisation
showed the IMF and donors that, this time, there is a clearly reformist
government in Cairo," a European diplomat observes. "Privatisation has become one
of the most important indicators."

<P> "We started in a low voice and the voice started to get louder as we went
on," says the policy's architect, public enterprise minister Atef Ebeid. It was
necessary to overcome criticism to create a programme that worked for Egypt. "We
knew there was a credibility gap," Ebeid adds.

<P> Partly to overcome the gap, Egypt has taken to privatisation with a
vengeance. Twelve companies have been offered for sale in the October-December
period alone. Nine of these were to be offered on a revitalised Cairo stock
exchange and six involved the sell-off of a majority stake.

<P> In the period to June 1998, 91 companies worth a total E&#163;18 billion will
be put on sale, 27 of them through public offerings. "We have a wonderful,
attractive menu for investors," says Ebeid.

<P> As policy indicators go, Egyptian privatisation is now good enough for the
IMF, whose new standby agreement is being put in place accompanied by a final
tranche of Paris Club debt relief.

<P> Creditors react with enthusiasm to Cairo's apparent conversion to divestment
of public assets and its parallel move towards small government. Although Cairo
brokers and foreign investors remain sceptical about the government's proposed
timetable, they agree that the policy changes are dramatic, coming as they do
after years of disputes over macroeconomic indicators and stalled reforms.

<P> Since the programme began three years ago, the 17 state holding companies for
public assets have sold stakes worth more than $700 million in 34 affiliates
through the stockmarket. Four industrial companies have been sold directly for
$177 million and Arab investors bought two Cairo hotels for $220 million.

<P> But the process has been difficult. In private, officials say the holding
company system is very hard to manage. While privatisation offers potentially
huge rewards &#173; with 314 state-owned companies worth $25 billion slated for
privatisation &#173; progress has been slow. The government appeared to lose its
nerve in 1994 and 1995, when it sold just five companies.

<P><B> Beverages leave sour taste </B> <P> So far, one high-profile sell-off, Al
Ahram Beverages, has failed. Problems included the high offer price, unattractive
labour situation, the brewery's antiquated machinery and concerns that the
monopoly beer-maker might suffer an Islamist backlash or competition in a
liberalised market.

<P> Al Ahram Beverages is being offered again, one of several larger industrial
enterprises seeking anchor investors. This follows a model whereby unprofitable
companies are offered to anchor groups that can provide technology transfer,
markets and other added value. Other better-off concerns are sold through the
bourse.

<P> Officials are confident that the beer-maker, the Egyptian Company for Food
and the Industrial Gases Company will sell to anchor investors that can reverse
their fortunes. Their confidence reflects the progress made this year. Forecasts
suggest $1.5 billion worth of assets will have been sold by the end of this year
and up to $3 billion-$4 billion by the end of next year.

<P> But not everybody is carried away on the bandwagon. Critics of the strategy
argue that it does not necessarily bring foreign investors into productive
job-creating sectors. "Privatisation is bandied about as the panacea for Egypt's
ills, and it certainly generates goodwill abroad and brings in portfolio funds,"
a Cairo banker comments. "Recent policy shifts have been encouraging, but policy
must focus on the physical world and not so much on financial machinery."

<P> The government argues that essential investment &#173; and growth &#173; will
follow from the focus on the &THORN;nancial machinery. The World Bank agrees and
is pushing hard for Egypt to raise investment levels, which now stand at 16%-17%
of GDP. "This needs to double if Egypt is going to achieve the 7% annual growth
needed to meet a very large employment problem," a World Bank official in Cairo
observes. "The only way to achieve the 500,000 jobs a year target is through
faster growth."

<P> Demand for all types of new instruments is growing, signalled this autumn by
the popularity of a seven-year Egyptian pound Treasury bond issue. As the
E&#163;4 billion issue was announced, &THORN;nance minister Mohieddin al-Ghareib
said foreign institutions had already signalled their wish to invest in the new
bonds: "It is the first time these investors have wanted to buy into Egyptian
currency instruments... It shows that perceptions have changed." The minister
sees this as evidence that foreign investors are picking up on trends in the
economy, which he forecasts will grow by 5.7% this year.

<P> These developments are under way in an increasingly sophisticated market
where banks and corporations have become rare issuers of global depository
receipts (GDRs) to raise capital.

<P> These were used to float tranches of stock in the Commercial International
Bank (CIB) and, most recently, Suez Cement Company, two stocks that account for
some 16% of the Cairo bourse's $10.5 billion capitalisation.

<P><B> Over-subscribed and credible </B> <P> The CIB led Egypt's invasion of the
capital markets through a $119 million GDR launched in London. The issue was five
times over-subscribed. The CIB's experience is that fund managers will take up
such issues if the issuer is credible, managing director Adel el-Labban says.

<P> "Peace in the region and publicity about the new Egyptian 'tiger' may have
helped attract some attention, but the election of [Israeli prime minister
Benjamin] Netanyahu and events in Lebanon put the regional argument on the
backburner in June as the issue came out," Labban recalls. "Many fund managers
were either neutral or negative at first, no one was all-out bullish."

<P> The performance of CIB &#173; whose part-privatisation was the first
divestment of a state holding in a bank since 1952 &#173; was the determining
factor, Labban argues. The record of CIB since has been impressive and
"eventually it was the CIB story that sold it". Private banks are also turning to
the market for funds.

<P> According to Ahmed Elbardai, vice-chairman of Citibank, this funding is
essential, not least because about 90% of Egyptian deposits are for less than
three or six nights and the system has to take a longer view. The old drawbacks
of holding funds in the banking system are diminishing fast, he says: "Exchange
rate concerns are no longer a problem... I hope we're going to see the rapid
growth of deposits for one, two and three years."

<P> Bankers expect mergers and acquisitions activity to follow, adding momentum
to a market where GDRs, domestic Treasury and bond issues are attracting
significant interest. But it is privatisation that has excited most comment.
Until recently, "fund managers were looking mainly at Latin America and eastern
Europe: Egypt was not high on their list," Labban says. "The fact that so much
portfolio investment is coming in was helped by the government's decision to
speed the privatisation process."

<P><B> Exchange set for boom </B> <P> The pricing and quality of the sale assets
have drawn foreign institutional investors, who have provided more than half the
funds coming into the programme and triggered a mini-boom in the Cairo
stockmarket. The markets are set to invest more heavily still in coming months,
especially after the World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC) puts
Egypt on to its daily emerging markets index in January.

<P> "As soon as Egypt goes into the IFC index, that immediately allows us to put
as much money as we feel is appropriate within our overall risk guidelines," Alan
Conway, overseas portfolio manager of Hermes Investment Management, the UK's
largest pension fund manager, was quoted recently as saying. "I've got Egypt down
to be one of the best performing markets over the next couple of years, but
[until now] I've been limited in my ability to put money into it."

<P> At home privatisation is not popular with everyone, but political obstacles
have been tackled, not least by the declaration in May that those who resisted
privatisation would lose their jobs. Six boards of directors and eight chairmen
of holding companies have been replaced, while objections from three opposition
parties have been ignored.

<P> A watershed came the same month with the decision by the cabinet
privatisation committee to increase the proportion of shares on offer in Nasr
City Housing and Development Company from 15% to 75%.

<P> This paved the way for the first public offering of a majority stake in a
<BR> public-sector firm, in which 1 million of the 2.8 million shares sold went
to 43 foreign institutions and investment funds, raising E&#163;435 million. The
stock exchange is booming as a result. Following the launch of the privatisation
initiative in May, daily trading volumes rose to E&#163;22 million, about 10
times the previous year's level.

<P> A series of fund management companies has emerged to handle the new funds,
the most prominent the brokerage and corporate finance house EFG-Hermes, one
result of the recent merger of the Egyptian Financial Group and Hermes Financial.

<P> Hermes Financial Management (Egypt) has created the offshore semi-closed
Egypt Fund, which recently floated a second tranche of shares valued at $34
million, following a $16 million initial share offer placed mainly with European
institutional investors. Gulf-based investors are another target. Other offshore
funds set up this year include a $46 million vehicle managed by HSBC James Capel
and a $74 million trust run by Lazard Freres Asset Management in New York. At
least 126 funds are investing in the market, says minister of economy and
international cooperation Nawal el-Tatawi: "This is because it is profitable. If
you take the PE ratio, compared to almost anywhere else it is good."

<P><B> Bureaucratic delays still hit market </B> <P> Much still has to be done to
improve the trading environment. A significant backlog of share transactions has
built up, meaning that it can take weeks to obtain ownership certificates.
Officials counter that this will be cut to three days after the start-up of a new
central depository, scheduled for November.

<P> The quest for private finance will remain central to policy because the state
can no longer finance infrastructure and industry. A move into private projects,
as much as privatisation of public assets, is intended to help avoid a return to
debt problems.

<P> Egypt has learned from its past mistakes and is committed not to raise the
debt burden again. Privatisation can help to balance the budget and attract
investment. But it cannot do everything. "Unemployment remains the critical
question &#173; it needs the inward investment policy to work if Egypt is not to
face real new problems, which could well be exacerbated by privatisation," a
western embassy analyst comments. "And then there is the level of poverty, which
must be addressed at a time when privatisation and measures to downsize the state
seem to be increasing the poverty gap."

<P> Institutional investors are warming to Egypt. In a country where balancing
the interests of different groups is so important, privatisation must be shown to
benefit the population at large.

<a href="wl.96.06.17.html"><H3> EGYPT </H3> </a>


<H4> The tourist industry is moving up-market to sustain growth in a
 sector that is a major employer </H4>
 
<H3> Pyramid selling </H3>

 <P>
In a year when tourists have been arriving in ever bigger numbers, the shooting
of a group of Greek holidaymakers in April has had no lasting effect. Income from
tourism rose 30% to a record $3 billion and the number of visitors rose by 28% to
3.6 million in 1995/96, fuelled by rapid development along the Red Sea coast.

<P> "Tourism is witnessing a real boom in Egypt," says tourism minister Mamdouh
el-Beltagui. Since July 1994, numbers have increased month by month; in the
&THORN;rst six months of 1996 the growth rate exceeded 32%. He believes 1996
could set a record with more than 4 million visitors, an important step towards
his target of 6 million arrivals a year by 2000. This would make tourism Egypt's
largest export revenue earner.

<P> Hoteliers and tour operators had worried that the massacre in Giza by gunmen
from the Gama'a al-Islamiya would lead to a new slump in the market, just as it
was recovering from the 1993-94 period when tourism was badly hit by Islamist
attacks. The latest attack near the Pyramids was the bloodiest incident in over
four years.

<P> It did not prove to be the case. "Egypt is safer than London, Paris,
Frankfurt, Florida, Madrid or Florence," argues Beltagui. "No tourist has been a
target as such since the autumn of 1994: the Greeks incident was a political,
criminal act against tourists considered to be Israelis." As a sign of the times,
the Islamist underground is said to have been criticised even by its sympathisers
for undermining an industry that employs thousands of poorer Egyptians.

<P> Egyptian tourism is now looking to go up-market. "We are attracting more
segments of the tourist movement," says Beltagui. "Egypt used to be considered
the elite cultural destination but we have diversi&THORN;ed by adding
recreational tourism, mainly in the Red Sea and Sinai, as well as curative
tourism, safaris, desert tourism and <BR> eco-tourism."

<P> Hotel capacity is expected to double from the current 70,000 rooms when a
raft of construction projects is complete. German, French and Italian investors
are among those striking signi&THORN;cant partnerships with the local private
sector.

<P> Privatisation will provide more opportunities. "Some assets have already been
sold, but many more are to come," Beltagui says. "We are planning to sell all our
hotels and cruise ships, with the exception of four historic monuments ... and
these, of course, will still be run privately under management contracts."

<a href="wl.96.06.17.html"><H3> EGYPT </H3> </a>


<H4> As Egypt &THORN;nally joins the global economy, businesses face up to the
threat of greater foreign competition </H4>

 <H3> Brave new world </H3>
 
  <P>
<I>By Jon Marks</I> 

 <P> Take the temperature in 10 Ramadan City, a rapidly
expanding industrial zone in the desert outside Cairo, and you find marked
variations on the thermometer of business confidence.

<P> Many businesses feel recession in the air but some are better able to adapt
than others. "July and August were very bad months for most people," reports
Waleed A Helal of household goods maker El Helal &amp; Golden Star Factories.
But, "for El Helal the same period was very good: our turnover increased 20%
year-on-year."

<P> The key is growth in areas where the Egyptian economy must expand if it is to
integrate into the global economy. "Our growth is partly explained by an increase
in the distribution network," says Helal, who is proud that his trucks serve
wholesale and retail outlets all over the country. "It is also due to more
exports, especially to new markets such as South Africa and Europe."

<P> Moving out of Cairo has speeded growth for the family-owned El Helal group.
"Since we came here 10 years ago we have been able to develop a big area for our
factories," Helal says. The company has steadily expanded its range of household
products and developed export markets, increasingly through joint ventures with
established partners.

<P> A short drive up the highway that bisects 10 Ramadan City, Redallah Mohamed
Helmy &#173; who is chairman of The Egyptian Fibre Manufacturing &amp; Products
Company and leading light in the Federation of Egyptian Industries &#173; muses
on macroeconomic problems. "Ask any business and they will tell you there is a
recession, which has spread to our markets in the Gulf."

<P> Keeping factories open is very difficult when "everybody is trying to delay
his payments". Helmy is not sanguine about the future: "I don't think this
problem will end in the next two years." Privatisation can help Egyptian industry
become more competitive in the long run, Helmy believes. "It is something the
country needs, but for change to be effective it needs the majority to
understand."

<P> Foreign investors complain about rigidities in a labour law that protects
workers from dismissal, but also keeps many on very low pay. British Gas country
manager M Hugh Miller says employment controls are an issue even for incomers
able to start recruitment from scratch. "We need to be able to pay at
international standards and make changes where required," he told the
Euromoney/World Link Egyptian Capital Markets and Investment Conference in
September.

<P> "You can't expect to hire and fire here," Xerox Egypt managing director
Gilles Acogny told the same forum. "So you have to do good recruitment."

<P> Structures of local companies remain largely hierarchical. Some line managers
at one of 10 Ramadan City's more go-ahead firms, disposable syringe-maker Arab
Medical Equipment Company, have been promoted from the production line and
trained to develop in directions unimaginable for their parents. But for most
workers, the future holds little beyond the same job.

<P> Companies will have to work hard to ensure that future industrialists have a
responsibility to protect jobs, argues Helmy. "We are bidding for tenders at
margins, which mean very low profits just to keep the machines running."

<P> Growth is seen as the key to job creation and a new entrepreneurial class is
emerging. "It is no longer bad to be rich, provided you can account for your
wealth," observes a Cairo banker.

<P> In entrepreneurs like the Oriental Weavers chief Mohamed Ferid Khamis, "a new
breed of Egyptian entrepreneurs is beginning to emerge," says the International
Finance Corporation's acting regional representative, Tarek Allouba. "The
<I>infitah </I>[late president Sadat's liberal opening] brought the private
sector into trading and contracting, but there was very little productive
investment," Allouba says. "It has taken nearly 20 years for it to happen, to get
over the easy money... Macroeconomic stabilisation since 1991 has made Egypt a
different country."

<P> But the government is still moving too cautiously for some. Cairo's
reluctance to cede control of strategic industries has produced a 40% limit on
divestment in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, flour milling, steel, aluminium
and electricity.

<P> A recent report compiled by the US Embassy in Cairo noted that the pace of
business deregulation remained relatively slow when measured against the
freeing-up of Asia's "tiger" markets. Key challenges, said the report, include
tackling "the propensity of Egypt's ponderous bureaucracy to mask or avoid the
decision-making process, causing delays in implementing projects, and a corollary
ability of ingenious and turf-conscious bureaucrats to insert themselves and
their regulations in many business decisions".

<P><B> Overbearing bureaucracy </B> <P> Foreign investors complain about a range
of problems, often focusing on bureaucracy, which officials concede can be
overbearing. "We still have not managed to bring [into the bureaucracy] the new
generation that started work in the free market economy," admits General
Authority for Investment (GAI) chairman Ibrahim Fawzy. But, he adds, "the rate of
improvement really is accelerating".

<P> Infrastructure weaknesses are also being overcome quickly, although
inefficiencies remain. Club Med's regional director Mustapha Engin leavened a
glowing report delivered to the investment conference by warning potential
investors, "it is best to get two [telephone] lines, because one will be cut for
non-payment of an invoice settled seven years before."

<P> The slow pace of trade liberalisation, a pillar of the reform programme, has
also been criticised. But remaining tariffs are to be slashed in the next decade
in line with agreements with the EU and World Trade Organisation.

<P> "Our people are going to have to learn to live with the consequences of the
GATT and other accords," Helmy observes. The government agrees. As Egypt
integrates into the EU's new Euro-Med zone and WTO structures, "the most
difficult competition will be with the industrial, manufacturing sector", says
economy and international cooperation minister Nawal el-Tatawi. The desire to
protect Egyptian business may jeopardise the government's goal of accelerating
GDP growth to 8% by 2000, which calls for a more dynamic business environment.

<P> Some sectors, such as vehicle assembly, are showing impressive results. This
business has grown rapidly in the past two years. Most major international models
are now produced at 12 assembly plants employing 75,000 workers, most of them
private. Existing production by General Motors, Peugeot, Suzuki, Citro&euml;n,
Daimler-Benz and Hyundai will rise following GAI approval of plans by a prominent
local businessman to invest E&#163;140 million in two new projects to assemble
under licence for Daewoo Corporation of South Korea and Germany's BMW. Skoda, Kia
and Nissan are all expected to begin production in the next two years, while
Germany's Volkswagen may source a number of components from Egypt if suppliers
meet international standards.

<P> Rapid industrial expansion will require new means of financing. The IFC is
developing a local leasing company with Commercial International Investment
Company, a Commercial International Bank affiliate.

<P> For bigger firms, "using the capital market is one way of growing businesses,
but it is not enough," says Citibank's Ahmed Elbardai. "It needs other forms of
capital formation, such as the development of venture capital funds." These are
starting to emerge.

<P> Family-run companies remain wary of using the stock exchange to raise
capital, resisting public disclosure in a corporate culture where the most basic
facts can be treated as valuable business secrets. "Family firms can be very
strong but they need capital to develop," Elbardai says. Some have agreed to
part-equity sales, which banks have bought into. "The bank does that to cement
relations," he observes. But innovation is critical "if Egypt is to become a
vibrant exporter".

<P><B> Payment innovation </B> <P> Ironically, traditional approaches to
financing may hold up innovation. At the El Helal complex in 10 Ramadan City, new
equipment is being installed and a $2 million order of plastic injection machines
is on its way from Cincinnati. Money will be provided by one of the business
development lines at the US Agency for International Development. The buyer pays
in Egyptian pounds through a local bank at local interest rates after two years.

<P> "Of course, we know we are paying a higher price," Helal concludes. "But if
you know you are being given two years' credit it is so much better... If the
Europeans knew what was good for them they would do the same."

In terms of net sales of fixed-interest securities,it has been the second largest market since 1992 by international standards.In Europe, the German bond market, with a turnover of Dm2.870 billion atyear-end 1995, occupies the leading position. The total volume of Deutschmarkbonds outstanding has roughly doubled compared with 1990. <BR><BR><B>Market segments and issuers</B> <BR><BR>In terms of turnover, bank bonds play a leading role in the German bondmarket (49% share in 1995), ranking above public sector issues (38.5% sharein 1995). Deutschmark-denominated Eurobonds accounted for 12% of issuancewhile corporate bonds play only a minor role in the German bond market,accounting for less than 1% of issuance in 1995. <BR><BR>The public sector, as a group of issuers, comprises the following agencies:<BR><BR>* The Federal government and its special funds, accounting for 56.6% and10.4% of public-sector debt respectively; <BR><BR>* the Treuhand agency (which ceased to exist at the end of 1994), accountingfor 12.7% of public-sector debt; <BR><BR>* the L&auml;nder governments, or federal states, accounting for 9.6% ofpublic sector debt; and <BR><BR>* the rail and postal services, accounting for 10.7% of public-sector debt.<BR><BR>The securities falling under the generic term of bank bonds comprise mortgagebonds, communal bonds and other bank bonds issued by mortgage banks, Landesbanks,credit institutions with special functions, and commercial banks. The marketfor foreign Deutschmark bonds is used by public and private issuers. ForeignDeutschmark bonds are issued in particular by public corporations and issuersfrom neighbouring European countries whose bonds are guaranteed by nationalpublic institutions, and by supranational issuers (such as the World Bank,the European Investment Bank, etc.). For details on Deutschmark-denominatedEurobonds see the following Euro-Deutschmark section. <BR><BR><B>Federal government bonds</B> <BR><BR>The Federal government uses a number of instruments to finance its debt(see Chart 4), the most significant being Bunds, which have a maturity atissue of 10-30 years and a volume per issue of up to Dm25 billion. At theend of 1994, the volume of Bunds outstanding amounted to Dm377 billion,corresponding to 51.7% of tradable government paper. Preliminary estimatesfor 1995 show that these figures increased to roughly Dm430 billion and55% respectively. <BR><BR>Up until now, Germany has concentrated its secured refinancing in 10-yearBunds and five-year Bobls. In the past, it also issued four-year Bundeskassenobligationenand four-year Bundesschatzanweisungen (Sch&auml;tze or Treasury notes),but these issues were stopped in 1995. Additionally, there were two 30-yearBunds in 1986 and 1993/94 but these were never issued on a regular basis.A certain part of refinancing also took place via retail paper (includingtwo-year zero-coupon bonds and some long-term paper; these were not tradedon exchanges and were not available for foreign investors). Table 1 givesan overview of the capital market financing activities of the federal governmentfrom 1990 to 1994 (1995 data not yet available). <BR><BR>Intermediate maturities are covered by Bobls, unlisted Bundesschatzbriefe(federal savings bonds) and - until mid 1995 - Sch&auml;tze (Treasury notes),which were discontinued in favour of Bobls. In the short-term sector, theFederal government issues unlisted Finanzierungssch&auml;tze (Treasury financingpaper), U-Sch&auml;tze (Treasury discount paper) and Schuldscheindarlehen(borrower's note loans). Federal government paper is issued through a syndicateand/or by auction or sale in the market as a tap issue. The average bid/offerspread in the liquid 10-year sector of the Bund market is usually 6bp. <BR><BR><B>Futures and options for government bonds</B> <BR><BR>For the hedging and arbitrage of interest rate risks, there is a wide rangeof futures and options contracts available (principally Liffe's and DTB'sBund and Euromark futures and options contracts; for further details seederivatives section). However, the exchanges do not cover the entire maturityspectrum, particularly at the ultra-long end, since the DTB's 30-year Bund(Buxl future) was discontinued in June 1995. <BR><BR><B>Bank bonds</B> <BR><BR>Bank bonds can be divided into three main categories: <BR><BR>* Mortgage bonds (Hypotheken-Pfandbriefe); <BR><BR>* municipal bonds (&Ouml;ffentliche Pfandbriefe) and <BR><BR>* other bank bonds. <BR><BR>Hypotheken-Pfandbriefe are a special instrument created to fund housingloans. They are subject to the Mortgage Bank Act or the Shipbuilding BankAct. These laws require the bonds to be fully collaterized by first-rankingmortgages. Pfandbriefe are covered by mortgages with an upper lending limitof 60 per cent of the property's lending value which itself tends to belower than the property's market value, thus eliminating the risk of realestate collateral being wiped out by a property crash. &Ouml;ffentlichePfandbriefe are issued to fund public sector loans (Schuldscheindarlehen).These act as the collateral. <BR><BR>In 1995, a new liquid segment of the Pfandbrief market emerged: the JumboPfandbrief. May 1995 was the turning point when Frankfurter Hypo launchedthe first-ever Dm1 billion Jumbo deal with a maturity of four years. Sincethen more than 60 Jumbos with a nominal value of more than Dm90 billionand maturities ranging from 2.5 to ten years have come onto the market.The term 'Jumbo' is used to denote Pfandbrief issues which have a minimumnominal value of Dm1 billion and which their issuers or a consortium quoteat a fixed bid/offer spread of 5bp to 10bp, depending on the maturity. Thisonly applies to trading lots of up to Dm25 million. Currently, more than90% of Jumbos are &Ouml;ffentliche Pfandbriefe (for details see Pfandbriefsection). <BR><BR>The other bank bonds may be divided into issues by special purpose banks(Kreditanstalt f&uuml;r Wiederaufbau, Industriekreditbank, Staatsbank Berlin)and private bank bonds. Special purpose banks issue bearer bonds with ahigher credit standing as they are guaranteed by the state. Bearer bondsissued by private banks are secured by the issuing banks' assets. <BR><BR><B>Investors: Foreign participation increases ...</B> <BR><BR>In the five years since reunification, foreign participants have steadilyincreased their share of the German bond market. In 1990, foreigners heldabout 15% of all outstanding Deutschmark bonds from domestic issuers. Sincethen, they have nearly doubled their market share to about 28% (they haveactually increased their holdings of all Deutschmark bonds by 450%). Inparticular during the bond rally in 1992/1993, they were strong buyers ofDeutschmark bonds absorbing the largest share of new government bond issues.<BR><BR>This was at a time when the government had to issue an historically highvolume of bonds to finance the restructuring of eastern Germany. This hugeamount of new government bond issues would obviously have triggered muchhigher bond yields in 1992/93 if foreigners had not been prepared to buyall these new issues. <BR><BR><B>... as domestic market share is down</B> <BR><BR>In contrast, domestic banks have been less active in the German bond market.Their market share has fallen fell from more than 40% in 1990 to less than37% in 1995, although their absolute holdings of Deutschmark bonds morethan doubled due to the increase in issuance. Domestic non-banks (includingprivate investors, funds, insurance companies and corporates) have alsoseen their market share fall since 1990 to 35.1% in 1995, However, sincea low of 32.4% in 1993, their market share may increase and these institutionsmay regain their former importance. (See Table 2.) <BR><BR>A more detailed analysis of foreign investors in Germany (for all capitalmarket products, i.e. including equities, derivatives and money market instruments)is given in Table 3. It underlines that investors in - or rather via - theUK are the most important international investors in German securities andthat this group shows the most volatile behaviour of all foreign investors.Investments from Japan and South-East Asia are also quite volatile. Theimportance of Luxembourg depends strongly on tax decisions in Germany, whilethere is quite stable demand from Switzerland and the US. <BR><BR><B>Foreign interest uneven</B> <BR><BR>However, the importance of the different investors for certain specificsectors of the bond market can only be seen by separately analysing theirmarket share in these specific sectors. This is because of uneven distributionof buying and selling activity between different investor groups and betweendifferent market sectors. <BR><BR>Although issuers of bank bonds have had some success in their recent effortsto boost foreign investors' interest in the German Pfandbrief market, manyforeigners still concentrate their investments in government bonds and Eurobonds.Nevertheless, this is changing gradually and the launch of a new segmentof the Pfandbrief market, the Jumbo market, has made Pfandbriefe much moreattractive to foreigners today. <BR><BR>Table 4 gives an overview of the market share of certain investor groupsfor the Pfandbrief and public sector bond markets since German unification.Foreigners are now the single most important investor group in public sectorbonds (including Bunds, L&auml;nderanleihen, Treuhand, Unity, Bahn, Postetc.) with a market share of nearly 40%, this even reaching 44.3% in thebull market of 1993 on the back of the strong appreciation of the Deutschmarkand the severe recession in Germany. <BR><BR>In contrast, all domestic non-banks have a relatively low market share,while foreigners held only 15% of all banks bonds in 1994 - though theyincreased their share in that segment from 3.5% in 1989. Table 4 also showsthat domestic funds, insurance companies and private investors are moreactive in bank bonds than in public bonds. This is partly a result of speciallegal rules, but is also caused by the yield pick-up that bank bonds offer.The importance of insurance companies in the bank bond market would be evenclearer if the table included registered bonds, but data on these bondsis not available. The statistical remainder (the part which can not be attributedto a special investor group) is revealed in the Bundesbank data and is addedto the banks in Table 4. <BR><BR>The rising market share of foreigners in recent years can be mainly attributedto the changing behaviour of funds and other institutional investors towardsmore international diversification. Furthermore, reforms to the German capitalmarkets have modernised them and made them much more accessible to foreigninvestors. <BR><BR>As a result, the dependency of the German bond market on international developments,in particular those in the US, has increased tremendously in the last coupleof years. This is also confirmed by our correlation analysis (see Table5) which reveals the strong influence of US Treasuries in the 1990s (onBunds and other bond markets). <BR><BR><B>Market perspectives</B> <BR><BR>The biggest challenge for the German bond market is without doubt the introductionof Emu from 1999 onwards. Even in an Emu environment, national governmentswill continue to play an important role as issuers. To enhance the Germangovernment's chances of becoming the Euro benchmark issuer and to strengthenGermany's ability to compete as a financial centre, further reforms to theGerman capital markets are needed. They include, inter alia, therapid conversion of all securities to Euros, the admission of short-termdebt paper, the introduction of a primary dealer system and regular issuanceof ultra-long bonds. Otherwise, when confronted with a future Eurobond market,German market participants may be at a competitive disadvantage, in particularagainst France. The German government and the Bundesbank are aware of thissituation and have already indicated that short-term debt paper (two-yearTreasury notes and six-month Bu-Bills), along with coupon-stripped bondswill be issued during the second half of 1996. <BR><BR>The Bundesbank also urges Germany to re-establish 30-year Bunds issuanceon a more regular basis. As far as the new Bu-Bills are concerned, it seemsthat Germany will be able to issue six-month paper via regular auctionsstarting in the third quarter of 1996 at the earliest. From a current perspectivethe third quarter looks rather ambitious, however. <BR><BR>These auctions may take place quarterly or every six months. To gain theBundesbank's approval, the volume of the new issues will be limited to afixed number (the exact number still has to be decided on, but a volumeof Dm50 billion seems to be the maximum). A rough indication for a possiblelimit can be taken from the so-called Bulis. This special short-term paperwas issued via the Bundesbank in 1993 and 1994 and reached a maximum volumeof Dm25 billion in 1993. There are plans to begin with two quarterly auctionsof Dm10 billion each. Thereafter an issuance of Dm20 billion every six monthsis envisaged. Note, however, that these plans are not officially confirmedyet - neither by the finance ministry nor by the Bundesbank. <BR><BR><BR><B>Chart 1: Size of the international bond market

The Euro-Deutschmark bond markethas steadily increased its market share over the years. The Deutschmarkis now the second most important reserve currency. This process has notbeen only triggered by the secular trend of Deutschmark appreciation versusthe major currencies but also due to a switch of the Bundesbank's marketregulation policy to an attitude which is much more investor-oriented thanin earlier years. In the last 10 years, the Bundesbank has abolished manyobstacles which had reduced the attractiveness of the Deutschmark-denominatedEurobond markets for foreign issuers and investors. <BR><BR>In 1985 the Bundesbank allowed German-based subsidiaries of foreign banksto lead manage Eurodeutschmark bond issues and opened the market to moreinnovative debt instruments such as FRNs, zero-coupon and dual-currencybonds. <BR><BR>Since 1989, the Bundesbank no longer requires lead managers to inform itahead of a planned issue, paving the way for issues on a standby basis suchas medium-term notes and commercial paper programmes. In 1992, the Bundesbanksaid it no longer requires Deutschmark bond issues to be governed by Germanlaw or to be listed on a German stock exchange. However, the lead managerof a Deutschmark issue must still be a bank domiciled in Germany. <BR><BR>In the last 4 years (since the beginning of the 1992/93 bull market forDeutschmark bonds), the outstanding volume of the Deutschmark Eurobond markethas surged and in fact nearly doubled. 1995 and 1996 has seen a very strongrise of the Deutschmark Eurobond market. <BR><BR><B>Issuers</B> <BR><BR>Private and public banks have been the most active issuers in the DeutschmarkEurobond market in the last 15 months but sovereigns, supranational issuers,several European governments and other authorities are also important playersin the market (see Table 1 and Chart 1). In comparison to those groups,international and private corporates play only a minor role in the DeutschmarkEurobond market. <BR><BR>Non-German corporates tap the market when swap rates are attractive, butare reluctant to carry unhedged Deutschmark debt on their balance sheetsdue to the secular appreciation of the Deutschmark. In the early monthsof 1996 the market has seen long-term issues low-rated central governmentcredits for the first time, namely the 10 and 15-year Eurobonds for theRepublic of Argentina. Table 2 gives an overview on the top borrowers inthe Euro-Dm bond market. <BR><BR><B>Investors</B> <BR><BR>Traditionally, the Deutschmark Eurobond market has been a retail marketbut this situation has changed slightly in recent years. However, althoughno official statistics are available for this market segment, it is wellknown that retail investors in Germany, Switzerland and the Benelux countriesstill play an important role, mainly due to tax reasons. <BR><BR><B>Instruments</B> <BR><BR>The range of debt instruments available in the Deutschmark sector is verylarge. Straight bonds are still the most widely used instrument in Eurobondfinancings, where fixed-rate issues have accounted for more than 50% ofthe market on a year-on-year basis. In the 1980s, bonds with warrants, eitherfor equity or debt, made their appearance in the Deutschmark sector. <BR><BR>At times, the issue volume in these instruments was very large, and recentlythe issuance of covered warrants without accompanying debt financing hasreplaced the traditional issuing method. Their share is currently around30%. Though convertibles were also sometimes popular with the issuers andinvestors and substantial amounts of these instruments have been issuedin the 1980s and early 1990s, their share has come down significantly. Floating-ratenotes (FRNs) are capital market instruments with variable-rate coupons linkedto money-market interest rates - most often Libor but increasingly Fibor.<BR><BR>In 1994, there was a surge in the issuance of new Deutschmark FRNs, whichwere designed to satisfy investor needs. In 1995 and so far in 1996 theirshare is about 7 % (see also Chart 2). The introduction of money marketfunds in Germany in August 1994 created further demand for Deutschmarksand for Deutschmark FRN issues. <BR><BR>FRNs can also be combined with a floor or a cap, providing the investorwith some downside protection against sharp falls in money market rates(floor) or providing the investor with a higher spread over the base rate;thus compensating the investor for giving up the opportunity of stronglyrising rates (cap). <BR><BR>Apart from the usual syndicated bond offerings, MTN or CP programmes providethe issuer with more flexibility. Under an existing credit line, the issuerhas the flexibility to draw new lines under an existing programme as andwhen necessary. <BR><BR>Global bonds are a relatively new innovation to the Euro-Deutschmark bondmarket, with the first Deutschmark global bond launched by the World Bankunder the lead management of Deutsche Bank and Salomon Brothers in 1993.Through intensive marketing with both foreign and domestic investors, aglobal bond issue helps raise the issuer's profile. And by concentratingon a few big issues and active market-making, funding costs can be reduced.<BR><BR><B>Underwriting and Syndication</B> <BR><BR>A few years ago it was customary in the Deutschmark bond market to launchan issue with large syndicates consisting of managing and sub-underwritingbanks (selling groups) involving smaller banks with only limited regionalplacement capabilities. <BR><BR>Increasing competition, declining management fees and the issuer's desireto maintain an active market in an issue for a sustained period of timehave considerably changed the traditional practice of bond issuance. <BR><BR>Today, Eurobond issues are launched by small groups of banks, meeting certainrequirements. The most important requirement is a strong international salesforceto ensure the necessary international placement capability. A lead managershould also have the ability to underwrite and successfully manage evenlarge issues, a fact that is often demonstrated by a high ranking in theinternational league tables. For Deutschmark Euro and global bonds the correspondingfigures are shown in Tabl e 3 with DMG as the leading bookrunner - benefitingfrom its triple-A rating and its widely recognized competence in Deutschmarkinstruments. <BR><BR>A lead manager should also play a prominent role in secondary market activities-otherwise the issue could attract only a limited number of investors dueto the perceived lack of liquidity. The ability to generate attractive swaps,often linked to the lead manager's international credit rating, is alsogaining importance. <BR><BR><B>Pricing</B> <BR><BR>Increasing market volatility and intensive competition have lead the issuingbanks and issuers to abandon the traditional syndication methods in favourof the so-called fixed price, re-offer system. The fixed price, re-offersystem was designed to return profitability and syndicate discipline tothe market, where cut-throat competition had become the norm. Under thissystem the lead manager would normally indicate the price as a spread relativeto a certain benchmark. <BR><BR>For a few hours the issuing banks would then offer their clients the issueat the fixed price. Once a sufficient amount of the issue has been placedthe lead manager announces the final terms of the issue and declares theissue to be 'free-to-trade'. Only then should normal primary market tradingstart. This procedure should ''theoretically' prevent the issuing banksfrom underbidding each other by offering early discounts from the offerprice, driving the price down and eroding management fees. <BR><BR><B>Trading</B> <BR><BR>Generally issue sizes in the Eurobond market are smaller than in the domesticgovernment bond market. Hence, an issue tends to become illiquid sooner.Therefore, it is important for the issuer as well as for the investor tofind lead managers committed to making a market in the issue for a sustainedtime period. <BR><BR>As an issue becomes more firmly placed with retail investors, liquiditygenerally decreases. For big issue sizes - Dm1bn or more - banks usuallymake an active market for one or two years. For liquid issues, the usualbid/offer spread is Dm0.05. Illiquid issues are quoted at a bid/offer spreadof Dm0.25 or Dm0.50. For liquid issues the average trade ticket at DeutscheMorgan Grenfell would be between Dm10m-Dm25m, while the average trade ticketfor less liquid issues is around Dm250,000-Dm1m. <BR><BR><B>Clearing and form of bonds <BR></B><BR>As a rule Euro-Deutschmark bonds are issued in bearer form, although someregistered bonds exist. A certain percentage of bearer bonds are still physicallydeliverable, but the trend is toward book entry only. Retail clients, inparticular, still have a pronounced preference for definitive bonds, andconsequently issues targeted at retail clients still provide for definitivebonds. Bearer bonds can be settled via the Deutscher Kassenverein, Euroclearor Cedel. For Deutschmark global bonds settlement via DTC is also possible.<BR><BR><B>Table 1: Issuers of Dm Eurobonds</B> <TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=1><TR><TD COLSPAN=8 ALIGN="CENTER"> </TD> </TR><BR><TR><TD></TD> <TD COLSPAN=2><B>1995</B></TD> <TD COLSPAN=2><B> 1996 (upto April)</B></TD> <TD COLSPAN=3><B> Total</B></TD> <TD></TD> </TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>Amount in mn (Dm)</TD> <TD>No of issues</TD> <TD>Amount in mn</TD> <TD>Noof issues</TD> <TD>Amount in mn</TD> <TD>Amount mn</TD> <TD>No of issues</TD> </TR><TR><TD>Sov/CG/SA/Sup</TD> <TD>30,667.35</TD> <TD>50</TD> <TD>16,290.00</TD> <TD>25</TD> <TD>46,957.35</TD> <TD> 32,680.05</TD> <TD>75</TD> </TR><TR><TD>PTE Corporates</TD> <TD>12,029.73</TD> <TD>60</TD> <TD>2,543.52</TD> <TD>12</TD> <TD>14,573.25</TD> <TD> 10,149.65</TD> <TD>72</TD></TR><TR><TD>Pub Corporates</TD> <TD>300.00</TD> <TD>1</TD> <TD> 0.00</TD><TD> 0</TD> <TD>300.00</TD> <TD> 207.60</TD> <TD> 1</TD> </TR><TR><TD>PTEBank/Fin</TD> <TD>73,998.41</TD> <TD>1697</TD> <TD> 28,970.35</TD> <TD>911</TD><TD>102,968.76</TD> <TD> 71,524.04</TD> <TD>2608</TD> </TR><TR><TD>Pub Bank/Fin</TD><TD>32,606.31</TD> <TD>121</TD> <TD> 16,495.10</TD> <TD>88</TD> <TD>49,101.41</TD><TD> 33,912.07</TD> <TD>209 </TD> </TR><TR><TD>Others</TD> <TD>4,150.00</TD><TD>12</TD> <TD> 350.00</TD> <TD> 2 </TD> <TD>4,500.00</TD> <TD> 3,142.05</TD><TD>14</TD> </TR><TR><TD><B>Total</B></TD> <TD><B>153,751.80</B></TD> <TD><B>1941</B></TD><TD><B> 64,648.97</B></TD> <TD><B>1038</B></TD> <TD><B>218,400.77</B></TD><TD><B> 151,615.45</B></TD> <TD><B>2979</B></TD> </TR></TABLE> <B>Chart1: Composition of Dm Eurobonds<BR><BR></B><IMG SRC="images/em.96.06.24.3.1.gif" WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="205"NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <B>Chart 2: Gross sales of Dm Eurobonds<BR><BR></B><IMG SRC="images/em.96.06.24.3.2.gif" WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="205"NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <BR><BR><I>Source: Datasream</I> <B>Table 2: Top borrowers in the Eurobond market</B><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=1> <TR><TD><B>Sovereigns</B></TD><TD><B>Supranational borrowers</B></TD> <TD><B>Banks</B></TD> </TR> <TR><TD>Austria</TD> <TD>EIB</TD> <TD>Deutsche Bank</TD> </TR> <TR><TD>Belgium</TD> <TD>WorldBank</TD> <TD>Dresdner Bank</TD> </TR> <TR><TD>Denmark</TD> <TD>Eurofima</TD><TD>Commerzbank</TD> </TR> <TR><TD>Finland</TD> <TD>EC</TD> <TD>L-Bank</TD></TR> <TR><TD>Ireland</TD> <TD>IADB</TD> <TD>Depfa</TD> </TR> <TR><TD>Sweden</TD><TD>ADB</TD> <TD>DSL</TD> </TR> <TR><TD>Argentina</TD> <TD></TD> <TD>KsW</TD></TR> <TR><TD>Hungary</TD> </TR> </TABLE> <HR><B>Chart 3: Av yields of bondsoutstanding 2/5/96 <BR><BR></B><IMG SRC="images/em.96.06.24.3.3.gif" WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="204"NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <BR><I>Source: Datasream</I> <HR><B>Table 3: Dm Euro and global bookrunners1995</B> <TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=1> <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>Managingbank/group</TD> <TD>No of issues</TD> <TD>Total</TD> <TD>Share (%)</TD></TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>1 Deutsche MG</TD> <TD>36</TD> <TD>17,045.37</TD><TD>17.29</TD> </TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>2 Dresdner KB</TD> <TD>23</TD> <TD>11,715.82 </TD> <TD>11.88</TD> </TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>3 CS First Boston</TD><TD>22</TD> <TD>6,777.95</TD> <TD>6.88</TD> </TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>4 Commerzbank</TD><TD>16</TD> <TD> 5,986.67</TD> <TD>6.07</TD> </TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>5 MorganStanley</TD> <TD>16</TD> <TD> 5,942.30</TD> <TD>6.03</TD> </TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>6SBC Warburg</TD> <TD>16</TD> <TD> 3,978.74</TD> <TD>4.04</TD> </TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>7Goldman Sachs</TD> <TD>8</TD> <TD> 3,947.05</TD> <TD>4.00</TD> </TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>8WestLB</TD> <TD>12</TD> <TD>3,832.48</TD> <TD>3.89</TD> </TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>9Paribas</TD> <TD>9</TD> <TD> 3,402.20</TD> <TD>3.45</TD> </TR> <TR><TD COLSPAN=2>10Merrill Lynch</TD> <TD>12</TD> <TD>3,294.96</TD> <TD>3.34</TD> </TR> </TABLE><FOOTER> <HR>For more information please contact:<BR><BR><B>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell<p></td></tr></table><br><nobr><a href="em.96.06.24.index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Back a Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt1.gif" alt="Back"></a><a href="../../../../../services/faqs.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Help';return true"><img width=22 height=22 hspace=90 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt2.gif" alt="Help"></a><a href="#top" onMouseOver="window.status='Top of the Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt3.gif" alt="Top"></a></nobr><br><br><nobr><a href="../../../../../alert/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='ALERT -

At the most basic level, the size of the market,with Dm1.258 trillion outstanding at the end of December 1995, means thatthe Pfandbrief now represents the third largest individual bond segmentoutside the US. Investors in the UK, for example, may be surprised to learnthat the Pfandbrief market is now more than twice the size of the Britishgovernment bond (Gilt) market. And while it naturally remains dwarfed bythe US and Japanese government bond markets, the Pfandbrief sector is comfortablythe largest fixed-income instrument in Germany, accounting for just under35% of the Deutschmark bond market at the end of 1995. Federal governmentbonds, by contrast, account for just under 28% of the market. <H3>YIELD AND SECURITY </H3>Its size apart, the Pfandbrief has historically been an important componentof German institutional investors' portfolios because it has offered anenviable combination of yield and security. <BR><BR>Yield has come in the form of a generous pick-up over Bunds, which has rangedfrom between 20 to 60 basis points, and which has traditionally reflectedthe relative illiquidity of the Pfandbrief market compared with the governmentbond sector. Until the start of 1995, the vast bulk of Pfandbrief issuestraded at identical yields. More recently, however, the emergence of thenew Jumbo Pfandbrief market, offering investors liquid and transparent issuesof between Dm1 billion and Dm5 billion, has led to the development of atwo-tier market in terms of yield. <BR><BR>The yield differential between &quot;traditional&quot; Pfandbrief issuesand the new Jumbo deals became especially pronounced over the first monthof 1996, during which time the spread between Jumbo Pfandbriefe and Bundsnarrowed sharply, from 25.6 basis points on January 2 to 14.2 basis pointsat the end of April. In a parallel development, the negative spread versusthe swap curve and the yield curve for traditional Pfandbriefe both widened.<BR><BR>In spite of these recent spread trends, the double-digit yield pick-up overBunds which the Jumbo Pfandbrief market offers investors remains highlyattractive in view of its outstanding credit quality - a quality which manyinvestors both within Germany and overseas are increasingly interpretingas ranking alongside the creditworthiness of the German government. <BR><BR><B>INVESTOR PROTECTION IS KEY </B><BR><BR>The unrivalled security of the Pfandbriefe is enshrined in the laws whichgovern their issuance and which are unequivocally committed to the protectionof investors. Broadly speaking, investor protection is guaranteed at twolevels - first, through the very clear legislation defining which institutionsare privileged by law to issue Pfandbriefe; and second, through the equallyclear and extremely conservative guidelines determining the quality andsize of the collateral backing Pfandbrief issues. <BR><BR>Germany's Mortgage Bank Act (enacted in 1900) and its Public Sector PfandbriefAct (passed in 1927) are the two laws which govern the issuance of Pfandbriefe,and under the terms of which issuance is strictly limited to four categoriesof German banks. These are the 24 pure private mortgage banks and the threemixed private mortgage banks (both categories are governed by the MortgageBank Act), the 12 regional Landesbanks and the six institutions which areclassified as &quot;public sector banks with special tasks&quot; (governedby the Public sector Pfandbrief Act). <BR><BR>As of the end of December 1995, 55.2% of the Pfandbrief market was accountedfor by private mortgage banks, with the remaining 44.8% the domain of publicsector issuers. <BR><BR><B>THE SOLIDITY OF THE COLLATERAL</B> <BR><BR>The collateral backing Pfandbrief issues takes the form either of loansmade to the public sector (in the case of &Ouml;ffentliche Pfandbrief) orof mortgages (Hypotheken Pfandbrief). &Ouml;ffentliche Pfandbriefe, whichaccount for over 70% of the total market, are fully collateralized by onelarge, separately registered pool of loans to, or guaranteed by, the publicsector. <BR><BR>Given that under the German system there is a constitutional obligationfor mutual financial support between the triple-A rated Federal government,the state and municipal governments and other public sector entities, itis self-evident that in terms of risk, the &Ouml;ffentliche Pfandbrief marketcan be viewed as having a similar ranking as the German government bondmarket. <BR><BR>The fact that no Pfandbrief issuer (either of &Ouml;ffentliche or Hypothekenpaper) has ever defaulted, bears witness to the rock-solid security andcreditworthiness of the instrument. <BR><BR>The collateral which backs the issue of Hypotheken Pfandbriefe derives itssolidity in part through the ultra-conservative parameters which defineits eligibility. Again, these bonds are fully collateralized by a singlelarge, separately registered pool of mortgages on residential and commercialproperty. But mortgages eligible as pool collateral must not exceed 60%of a property's lending value, which equals an over-collateralization of167%. Additionally, the valuation of the underlying property (lending value)within the collateral pool must be based on its permanent characteristicsand on the income that can be earned from the property on a sustained basis,without taking the expected appreciation (or capital gain) of the property'svalue into account. As a rule of thumb, the lending value of eligible poolcollateral has typically been between 10% and 15% below a property's actualmarket value. <BR><BR><B>MORE THAN A MORTGAGE-BACKED <BR></B><BR>For want of a more accurate official translation, non-German investors stillfrequently - but erroneously - assume that the Pfandbrief market is similarto the mortgage-backed securities market with which they are familiar incountries such as the US and the UK. In reality there are more differencesthan similarities between the two markets, meaning that ultimately investorswill need to accept that the term Pfandbrief has no direct translation inthe jargon of the international capital markets. <BR><BR>One of the most important differences between the Pfandbrief market andthe mortgage-backed sector is that there is no link between any individualcollateral within the collateral pools and any particular Pfandbrief issue.Specific assets within each pool are not segregated to cover individualPfandbrief issues. In other words, if a Pfandbrief bank were to become insolvent,holders of Pfandbriefe would have first claim on the respective collateralpools in addition to recourse to any other of the bank's assets. <BR><BR>Another key difference between the two market sectors is that in the mortgage-backedmarket a special vehicle company (SVC) is set up and the assets are soldoff-balance sheet. In Pfandbrief transactions the assets remain on-balancesheet. As a result, the issuing bank (rather than the SVC) remains fullyliable for timely payments of interest and repayment of principal. <BR><BR>A third important difference is that the prepayment risk which is typicalin the mortgaged-backed market is non-existent in the Pfandbrief sector.<BR><BR><B>JUMBOS HIGHLIGHT DIFFERENCES <BR></B><BR>The very clear differences between US-style mortgage backed securities andGerman Pfandbriefe have been graphically illustrated over the course ofthe last year, with the emergence of the new 'Jumbo' Pfandbriefe. The sheersize of each individual Jumbo issue - set at a minimum of Dm1 billion -has dictated that the vast majority of transactions in this new sector havebeen collateralized against loans to the public sector, rather than againstresidential mortgages. In this respect the name &quot;baby Bunds&quot;,coined by non-Germans who find it difficult to pronounce the German word&quot;Pfandbrief&quot;, is not too far off the mark. <BR><BR>By the end of April 1996, of the Dm83.5 billion of Jumbo issues which hadbeen launched, Dm77 billion (close to 92%) was accounted for by &Ouml;ffentlichePfandbriefe. Of the 54 Jumbo bonds which had been launched by the same date,only four were classified as Hypotheken Pfandbriefe. In other words, theJumbo Pfandbrief sector has almost nothing to do with the German mortgagemarket. Instead, an investor buying Jumbo Pfandbriefe will be gaining exposureto German government risk with a yield pick-up over Bunds. <BR><BR><B>JUMBOS ADD LIQUIDITY</B> <BR><BR>The development of the Jumbo Pfandbrief market - which was kickstarted inMay 1995 with a Dm1 billion issue launched by Frankfurter Hypo - has beencritical for a number of other reasons. <BR><BR>First and foremost, it has injected substantial levels of liquidity intothe market. In its special study of the German bond market, published inAugust 1994, Deutsche Bank noted that the typical size of a Pfandbrief issueranged from between Dm50 million and Dm500 million, although traditionalPfandbriefe have also been launched in packages as small as Dm10 million.<BR><BR>In today's new Jumbo market, the average issuance size to date has beenDm1.52 billion. The largest individual issue so far has been the Dm5 billionJumbo launched in November 1995 by DePfa. <BR><BR><B>JUMBOS BRING FOREIGN INVESTORS <BR></B><BR>A second critical feature of the new German Pfandbrief market is that itsenhanced liquidity has clearly attracted the attention of internationalinvestment bankers and institutional investors. <BR><BR>At the end of 1994 (the latest date for which official figures are available),foreign investors accounted for only 11.7% of the total Pfandbrief market,which compared with a 45% holding of Bunds. At the same date, the lion'sshare of the market was accounted for by domestic institutional investorswhich held over 78% of all outstanding Pfandbriefe. <BR><BR>Today, it is believed that foreign holdings of Pfandbriefe are now muchhigher than the 11.7% recorded at the end of 1994. This is in part becausean essential feature of the new Jumbo market is the placing of new issuesvia syndicates made up of between three and six marketmakers continuouslyquoting two-way prices. <BR><BR>Since September 1995, when Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) was the firstnon-German institution acting as a joint bookrunner for a Jumbo Pfandbriefissue, international banks have been increasingly joining bookrunning syndicates.<BR><BR>In total, bookrunning by foreign banks accounted for 28.3% of the totalvolume raised in the Jumbo Pfandbrief market over the first quarter of 1996,compared with 15.8% for the whole of 1995. <BR><BR>In a reflection of the expanding role of foreign lead and co-lead managementof Jumbo issues, the Pfandbrief Quarterly, a bulletin published by DeutscheBank, has started to incorporate a regular league table of Jumbo issue bookrunners.In the first of these, published in April, Morgan Stanley came fourth, withTrinkaus &amp; Burkhardt (a subsidiary of the HSBC Group) sixth, UBS eighth,and Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and ABN AMRO 11th, 12th and 13th respectively.<BR><BR><B>THE PFANDBRIEF GOES GLOBAL</B> <BR><BR>Morgan Stanley owes its elevated position in this league table exclusivelyto the important contribution it made to the development and internationalizationof the Pfandbrief market in the first quarter of 1996. <BR><BR>This came in the form of its role as sole and joint lead manager (togetherwith Commerzbank and UBS) of the two global Pfandbrief issues launched inFebruary by DePfa which raised Dm2 billion and Dm1.5 billion respectively.<BR><BR>The international diversity of investor participation in both these issuesspeaks volumes for the new-found global acceptance of the Pfandbrief. Accordingto DePfa, 19% of the two issues was placed in the US, with a further 28%taken up by Asian institutions. <BR><BR>Equally encouraging was that of the 53% bought by European investors, only13% remained in Germany. The placement was carried out in accordance withusual market practice for global issues and included a pre-marketing aswell as a bookbuilding phase. <BR><BR>Although the two DePfa global issues generated considerable excitement andpress coverage both in Germany and abroad, they have not been the only landmarkPfandbrief issues to have made an important contribution to the internationalizationof the market. Prior to the DePfa globals, the Dm3.5 billion issue launchedin January by Hypothekenbank in Essen had been the first Jumbo Pfandbriefto have featured standard Eurobond syndication and fee structures, withsix joint bookrunners and a selling group of 16 institutions. <BR><BR>Later in the same month, Bayerische Vereinsbank issued the first Jumbo Pfandbriefto have been placed via a syndicate using the fixed price re-offer method.This 10-year Dm1.5 billion issue, which was co-led by Bayerische Vereinsbank,Commerzbank, Merrill Lynch and UBS, was also the first Jumbo to have beenpriced against a benchmark Bund issue. <BR><BR>Although in its first 10 months the Jumbo Pfandbrief market grew with breathtakingand unexpected speed - with total outstanding volume breaking through theDm50 billion mark by January 10 1996 - few market participants believe thatthis level of new issue activity can be maintained over the coming year,for several reasons. <BR><BR>First, a hazier macroeconomic and interest rate climate is already suggestingthat 1996 is unlikely to be as prosperous a year for European bond investorsas 1995. <BR><BR>Second, Germany's mortgage bank sector can only issue new Pfandbriefe involumes which are proportionate to the increase in its new lending. Finitedemand for new lending in Germany translates automatically into a finitesupply of new Pfandbriefe. <BR><BR>Be that as it may, it is self-evident that the Jumbo Pfandbrief market ishere to stay. Even assuming a gradual deceleration in the level of new monthlyissuance of Jumbo Pfandbriefe (from between 20% to 30% in the latter monthsof 1995 to between 7% and 10% in mid-1996, and 5% to 6% by year-end 1996),it is expected that by the end of this year the total volume outstandingwill be in the neighbourhood of Dm130 billion - which would equate to about10% of the entire Pfandbrief market (traditional Pfandbrief and Jumbo issuescombined). <BR><BR><B>A STANDARDIZED DEFINITION </B><BR><BR>To support the long-term transparency of the Jumbo Pfandbrief market, astandardized definition of the term 'Jumbo' is imminent. Only issues witha minimum size of Dm1 billion, which are in the form of straight bonds (asopposed, for example, to FRNs), and which have at least three marketmakerspermanently quoting two-way prices will be allowed to market themselvesunder the Jumbo banner. A 'Grandfather' clause will, however, enable existingissues of Dm1 billion or more self-led issues with the issuer being theonly marketmaker, to continue to be referred to as Jumbo Pfandbriefe. <BR><BR><B>JUMBOS PART OF A LARGER PLAN</B> <BR><BR>In spite of the obvious success of the Pfandbrief Jumbo market to date,it is a mistake to view the developments in the Jumbo sector in isolation,or as a one-off move to enhance volumes, liquidity and transparency. Itis more accurate to interpret the evolution of the Jumbo market as an essentialcomponent of a much broader mosaic which will continue to be enhanced anddeveloped in order to underpin far-reaching support for the market, bothdomestically and overseas. <BR><BR>Encouraged though they have clearly been by the early success of the Jumbomarket, German bankers are sufficiently realistic to acknowledge that itslaunch coincided with an especially benign environment for the Europeanfixed-income market. As a result, they are equally aware that the Pfandbriefmarket needs to be developed further, in order to provide it with a numberof essential safeguards to protect it from any long-term turbulence in thebond market. <BR><BR>Many of these initiatives have already been made. A Pfandbrief index (thePEX Index) has been launched, re-based to 1988 and offering investors amore efficient means of tracking the performance of their Pfandbrief holdings.<BR><BR>More recently, in December 1995, a computer-based bond-trading system, IBIS-R(modelled on the IBIS system which has served the German equity market sowell), was also launched, which was viewed as a further important step towardsbolstering secondary market liquidity in the Pfandbrief sector. <BR><BR><B>GROWING DEMAND FOR RATINGS <BR></B><BR>Another critical recent development in the Pfandbrief market - and one whichbodes well for its rapidly expanding global acceptance - has been the growingdemand for internationally-recognized investment grade ratings among theleading Pfandbrief issuers. Although the senior unsecured debt of many ofthese banks have enjoyed long-standing and prestigious ratings from agenciessuch as Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), Moody's and IBCA, until very recentlyonly one Pfandbrief issuer (Frankfurter Hypo) had secured a rating specificallyrelating to its Pfandbrief issues. Over the course of the last year, a numberof other major issuers in the market - including Bayerische Vereinsbank,DePfa, L&uuml;becker Hypothekenbank and the Commerzbank subsidiary, RheinischeHypothekenbank - have all followed suit, each securing triple-A (or equivalent)ratings on their Pfandbriefe. As more issuers seek to broaden their investorbase still further, it is to be expected that the number of banks issuingrated Pfandbriefe will continue to grow. <BR><BR><B>INNOVATIONS IN THE PIPELINE <BR></B><BR>Looking to the future, a number of other innovations are expected in thePfandbrief market, which will further enhance its international standingby bolstering liquidity and attracting a more diversified range of investors.These include the emergence of a Pfandbrief repo market, options on Pfandbriefissues and, ultimately, the introduction of a Pfandbrief futures contract.<BR><BR>Bankers believe that a Pfandbrief future would most likely be modelled onthe existing five year DTB Bobl future, and that only triple-A rated JumboPfandbriefe with a remaining maturity of between three-and-a-half and fiveyears would qualify as deliverable paper for a futures contract. <BR><BR>Analysts at Frankfurter Hypo believe that an underlying volume of deliverablepaper of between Dm70 billion and Dm80 billion would be a prerequisite forthe establishment of a well functioning five-year Pfandbrief contract. <BR><BR>Although the total volume now outstanding which would be eligible for deliveryin accordance with these parameters stands at Dm32 billion, it is anticipatedthat, if the market continues to grow at or near current rates, an adequatevolume of deliverable paper could be built up within the next two years.<BR><BR><B>A PIONEER IN THE MARKET <BR></B><BR>The newly named Frankfurter Hypothekenbank Centralboden (FHC or FrankfurterHypo for short) came about as a merger in 1995 which joined FrankfurterHypothekenbank and Deutsche Centralbodenkredit. A subsidiary of triple-Arated Deutsche Bank, who own 95% of the company, the new FHC entity is thesecond largest private pure mortgage bank in Germany in terms of assets,with total assets of Dm76.1 billion and total equity of Dm2.2 billion. <BR><BR>Prior to this merger, the old Frankfurter Hypothekenbank had always actedas an important pioneer in the Pfandbrief market, making a key contributiontowards the internationalization of the instrument. In 1987, the bank wasthe first in Germany to secure a triple-A rating on its Pfandbrief issuesfrom Standard &amp; Poor's, and, more recently, it was the first to launcha Jumbo issue. By the end of May, 1996, FHC had launched four Jumbo Pfandbriefewith a total volume of Dm4.5 billion. <BR><BR>FHC's mortgage collateral and public sector loan pools are well diversified.At the end of December 1995, its property collateral was valued at Dm27.6billion, accounted for by almost 100,000 individual loans widely dispersedamong 16 German L&auml;nder. On the same date, FHC's total public sectorloan pool was valued at just under Dm35 billion, 100% of which was accountedfor by domestic loans. <HR><BR><B>Growth of Pfandbriefe outstanding since 1980<BR><BR></B><IMG SRC="images/96.06.24.4.1.gif" WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="165" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <BR><BR><B>Growth of the Jumbo Pfandbrief market<BR><BR> </B>  <IMG SRC="images/96.06.24.4.2.gif" WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="182" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <BR><BR><B>Pfandbrief: third largestbond market outside US <BR><BR></B><BR><BR><IMG SRC="images/96.06.24.4.3.gif" WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="173"NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <BR><BR><B>Total gross sales of Dm bonds<BR><BR> </B>  <IMG SRC="images/96.06.24.4.4.gif" WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="182" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> <BR><BR>For more information please contact: <BR><BR>Ingo S&ouml;hngen <BR>Securities department Junghofstra&szlig;e <BR>5-7 60311 <BR>Frankfurt am Main <BR>Tel: +49 69 29898 215 <p></td></tr></table><br><nobr><a href="em.96.06.24.index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Back a Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt1.gif" alt="Back"></a><a href="../../../../../services/faqs.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Help';return true"><img width=22 height=22 hspace=90 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt2.gif" alt="Help"></a><a href="#top" onMouseOver="window.status='Top of the Page';return true"><img width=22 height=22 border=0 src="../../../../../images/navt3.gif" alt="Top"></a></nobr><br><br><nobr><a href="../../../../../alert/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='ALERT - Discussion Groups, Latest News, Site Updates, Sponsors and Events Diary';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav1.gif" alt="Alert"></a><a href="../../../../../search/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SEARCH - Keyword and Structured Searches';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav2.gif" alt="Search"></a><a href="../../../../../services/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='SERVICES - FAQs, Feedback, Problems and EMWL Team';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav3.gif" alt="Services"></a><a href="../../../../../contents/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='CONTENTS - Publications, World Map, Product Sections and Data';return true"><img width=120 height=31 border=0 hspace=0 src="../../../../../images/nav44.gif" alt="Contents"></a></nobr></font><br><br><font size=2>All material subject to strictly enforced copyright laws. 1996&copy; <a href="MAILTO:pbrady@pobox.com">Euromoney Publications PLC.</a></font><br></center></body></html>

<H4> Egypt's long-promised economic reforms, spearheaded by privatisation, at
last seem to be in full &thorn;ow </H4>

 <H3> Flood tide for reform </H3> 
 
 <P>
<I>By Jon Marks</I> 

<P> Egyptians have been crowding Cairo's cinemas to see
a film dramatising the former leader Gamel Abdel Nasser's role in the Suez
crisis. <I>Nasser 1956</I> marks a return to form for Egypt's once-great film
industry and underlines its subject's continuing fascination for the Arab world.
But 40 years after the Anglo-French invasion the shadow of Nasser also hangs over
Egypt's economic planners, who face the daunting challenge of restructuring his
less glorious legacy of bureaucracy and state management.

<P> Since President Hosni Mubarak appointed Kamal el-Ganzouri prime minister at
the start of this year, there have been clear signs that this legacy is finally
being paid out.

<P> After years of stop-start reforms, the IMF and World Bank are fulsome in
their praise for the latest economic programme which centres on privatisation. As
the influential minister of state for economic follow-up, Youssef Boutros Ghali,
likes to put it, "The 21st century in Egypt has started in 1996." Not least, this
is a recognition that the country can no longer ignore the global economy in its
domestic policy. Critics argue that commitments to reform, although welcome, are
not the same as its implementation. But their voices are drowned by praise from
international organisations and investors lining up to put their funds into
Egyptian markets.

<P><B> Personal commitment to results </B> <P> The apparent success of Ganzouri's
appointment as Egypt's first new premier in nine years has surprised many
observers. "In many respects his commitment to reform has been very impressive: I
had thought that as a long-time minister he would just continue with old
approaches to policies, but so far this has not proved the case," says one Cairo
banker.

<P> Ganzouri is identifying personally with key aspects of policy, giving the
reform process a focus it has long required, diplomats say. "The first wave of
reforms in 1991 did not really affect people's lives, except for a few measures
such as lifting subsidies," a US official observes. "This time the government
wants to go further and Ganzouri has taken responsibility for success or failure
at a personal level."

<P> Underpinning the new mood is Egypt's access to generous international
support. Since the late Anwar Sadat signed the Camp David peace accords with
Israel in 1979 Egypt has received massive US aid, now running at more than $2
billion a year. Because Egypt was lynchpin in the 1990-91 Gulf war coalition it
has also benefited from substantial debt relief. Few countries have enjoyed the
benefits of a $10 billion debt write-off or such large aid flows.

<P> This has underwritten the economic take-off. Contrary to the situation faced
by most liberalising economies, Egypt's foreign reserves are estimated at over
$18 billion and rising. Cairo bankers would like to see some of this channelled
into the economy to increase liquidity, but finance minister Mohieddin al-Ghareib
says it is not necessary: "We are now following the free market &#173; if we have
been able to build up our reserves, it is a result of the confidence of the
international community."

<P> With foreign exchange flowing in through the stock exchange and
privatisations, investment is starting to feature in an economy previously
dependent on aid. The more investment expands, Ghareib observes, "the more
foreign funds come in to be converted into Egyptian pounds, and stronger reserves
are a by-product".

<P> For macroeconomists and capital markets investors this is Egypt's year in the
sun, which even the gloom surrounding the stalled Middle East peace process
cannot darken. Arguably the world's oldest national entity or country, Egypt is
finally speaking the language of the global economy.

<P> "We have all the indicators in the right proportions in 1996 &#173; and we
have financial infrastructure in terms of banking and the capital market,"
enthuses economy and international cooperation minister Nawal el-Tatawi. Stable
and improving macroeconomic balances and an opening of local markets are
essential, Tatawi says: "So we can start looking for acceleration of the overall
growth rate and, in different sectors, look to improve productivity, promote
exports and, with the objective of improving the well-being of the people,
generate employment, per capita income growth and regional development to spread
the benefits of development."

<P><B> Unveiling of new projects at MENA </B> <P> The government's message will
be reiterated as the third Middle East/North Africa (MENA) Economic Summit
unfolds in Cairo. In a year when economic reforms have finally yielded fruit, the
summit has become the centrepiece of Egypt's economic policy push. A
comprehensive list of projects for private-sector financing, involving
investments worth some $16 billion concentrated in transport, oil and gas,
tourism and electricity, was set to be presented to the world during the November
meeting.

<P> The marketing campaign will be backed by further commitments to a
liberalising policy by the leaders of the self-proclaimed "new tiger on the
Nile". According to IMF executive director Abdel Shakour Shaalan, "tighter
monetary policy and improved regulation have restored confidence and stopped the
dollarisation of the Egyptian economy". He should know, having helped steer a
rocky course through the troubled waters of relations with the Fund over many
years.

<P> The intensity of the government's approach and its adherence to a tight
reform timetable since Ganzouri's appointment have surprised cynics and persuaded
some that this time things will be different. Others prefer to wait and see,
echoing a western diplomat who says: "We are very encouraged, but it is too early
to say if the pace of change can be maintained."

<P> Further and faster structural reforms are embodied in Egypt's new IMF standby
agreement, which was to be signed as <I>World Link</I> went to press. The
24-month standby loan will replace the IMF's extended fund facility (EFF), which
was approved in 1993.

<P> The EFF failed to pass its first review when differences over economic
indicators, including exchange rates, proved irreconcilable. It is a sign of
changing times that devaluation is no longer an issue and neither is the pace of
reform, which in the past has usually solicited comparisons with the timeless
flow of the country's defining physical feature, the River Nile.

<P> Closing the book on the protracted debt crisis of the '80s, Egypt has waited
three years for the IMF deal. This allows it to tap other financing facilities
and obtain a final $3.9 billion tranche of debt-forgiveness agreed with Paris
Club creditor governments in 1991. The resulting saving of up to $300 million in
annual interest payments will help to compensate for reductions in customs duties
and other import tariff fees.

<P> Reforms agreed with the IMF include cuts to the civil service, which is set
to cause new controversies in a country where so many are employed (or
under-employed) by the state. According to Ghareib, "The IMF agreement says that
we must cut the size of government by 2% a year, but we are working to reduce it
by even more this year."

<P><B> Ready for reform </B> <P> Officials argue that careful management of
popular opinion means that Egyptians are ready for such reforms. "There have been
many criticisms and we have had to be patient," public enterprise minister Atef
Ebeid told an investment conference in September. "But the pace can now be
accelerated: we have to continue the reform."

<P> The government is convinced that the greatest challenge of recent years,
radical Islam, is now under control. Islamist underground groups have reportedly
killed nearly 1,000 people since 1992, but they also suffered heavy losses which
have reduced their operational capacity. Analysts predict that as long as
President Mubarak, aged 68, remains healthy and continues to be seen as a
guarantor of political stability, the substantial majority of Egyptians will
overlook calls for radical change to a moribund party political system and
re-elect the head of state for a fourth presidential term in 1999.

<P> While radical Islam has posed a real threat, the government has benefited
from the relatively equanimical nature of the population. This often leads
political commentators to decry the lack of an ideology or common vision among
Egyptians.

<P> Commenting on a rare opinion poll, carried out in 1994, political scientist
Nader Fergany noted that many Egyptians remain at the margins of political life.
Fergany noted: "In societies where educational attainment is poor [only half the
population is literate], minds are subject to the pervasive influence of
one-sided mass media and effective political participation is penalised, social
consciousness tends to be feeble and one should not expect people to hold strong,
logically articulated opinions. In such a society, it is probably more accurate
to speak of public sentiment than public opinion."

<P> The government is well aware of the volatility of "public sentiment" and has
worked harder than before to prepare the population for strong reforms. According
to Ebeid: "Privatisation will lead to a reduction in the labour force, but labour
organisations understand this and are willing to co-operate." This, the powerful
minister concludes, is because "they know it will lead to some unemployment in
the short run, but in the medium term it will help the masses of workers".

<P> There are limits to how fast change can be brought about in a country where
poverty and unemployment remain critical problems. Diplomats in Cairo believe
basic food subsidies will remain in place, especially as Egypt looks to the
experience of its neighbours and remembers the turbulence caused in Jordan this
summer by the removal of bread subsidies.

<P> Resistance is also expected to higher prices for other items. But the right
to charge more for services may be essential to the government's ambitious plans
for infrastructure development, using build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) and other
private financing techniques. As one donor official observes: "In Egypt, things
like water for irrigation and agriculture are free: it is a precedent established
by the Pharaohs and no one has changed it since."

<P> Elsewhere, the next few years could see radical change, with the pace set by
a further overhaul of business practices. Drafts of a unified Companies Act and a
new unified investment law, which would replace the current Law 230 and other
conflicting legislation, are ready.

<P> There are continued complaints by foreign operators about the blockages still
caused by Egypt's ponderous bureaucracy and other legacies of Nasserite
economics. As the private sector learns to stand alone, a deregulated environment
is seen as essential.

<P><B> Get up, stand up </B> <P> "If you are privatising, the private sector
entity has to stand on its own feet: it may need a bank guarantee, but it should
not lean on the state to do its job for it," argues Boutros Ghali.

<P> The current policy in Cairo is to ask all Egyptians to stand on their own
feet. It will not be easy for anyone, from the rural poor of Upper Egypt and
state-sector employees, used to low-paid jobs for life, to industrialists
accustomed to the cushion of high tariffs and cheap money. A challenge has been
thrown down. Egypt can meet it provided investment flows create the 500,000 new
jobs a year the government wants and much-needed safety nets like the social fund
can function adequately.

<P> A Cairo banker observes that past reforms failed to deliver the expected
results: "When it came to the crunch we had no growth and no real development
strategy, and we ignored a very skewed income strategy." This time, the
government promises it will be different. According to Boutros Ghali: "We have to
move on all fronts simultaneously and we have the means to do it."

<P> Backed by debt relief and political impetus on a scale that few similarly
placed countries have enjoyed, Egypt is poised to show doubters that when it
comes to liberal reform, the traditionally slow-moving Nile is in full flood.

<H4> Population growth and chronic pollution are damaging the health and economic
prospects of Cairo's people </H4> 

<H3> Shadow over the sun </H3> 

<P><I>By Jon Marks</I> 

 <P> Cairo is choking under the weight of people struggling to make
a living. It is also choking from pollution, which even a raft of big-ticket
projects financed by donor funding cannot hope to eradicate in the foreseeable
future.

<P> On the Nile waterfront, prestige buildings give Cairo a glamorous image. But
in the shadows are a maze of narrow lanes in which poorer families crowd. Some
newcomers even sleep in makeshift shelters in the street as they wait to obtain a
tenement.

<P> And the street is crowded after 5,000 years of settlement. In 1800, there
were about 300,000 people in Greater Cairo. By 1930, the number had quadrupled.
The population officially stood at 4.4 million in 1960, growing to 11.5 million
in 1990 and a projected 16.6 million by the end of the century. These could well
be conservative estimates.

<P> The city's environmental crisis is now so bad that the forest of minarets,
which help give traditional Islamic neighbourhoods their unique flavour,
disappear into an orange haze during rush hour and shroud the pyramids from
passers-by in Giza.

<P> Studies have identified lead pollution as the most serious of Cairo's many
environmental problems. A USAID-funded comparative risk assessment, undertaken in
1994, showed that Cairo had the world's worst air pollution in terms of suspended
particulates and lead, which causes 25,000 deaths or more every year.

<P> Lead pollution significantly increases the blood pressure of all Cairo
residents. According to the USAID report, children raised in Cairo are in danger
of losing on average an estimated 4.25 IQ points as a result of lead pollution.
The economic cost of this IQ loss is estimated at $13 billion.

<P> Projects such as the massive Cairo wastewater scheme, efforts to reduce lead
and other emissions and the benefits of economic growth are improving the
situation. But there is a long way to go.

<P> Egypt's minister responsible for the environment, Atef Ebeid, speaks proudly
of his country's fast-developing gas industry and clean-up campaigns. Buses and
vans are being fitted with gas tanks but the majority remain dependent on leaded
petrol.

<P> Multilateral agencies are lining up substantial support, with the World Bank
and European Investment Bank focusing on a huge Mediterranean clean-up campaign.
In October, the Bank announced that the Middle East region's first Mediterranean
Environmental Technical Assistance Programme (METAP) office would open in Cairo.
In addition, the World Bank has approved a $20 million loan while the
International Development Association has given a $15 million credit.

<P> The World Bank loan is planning to part-finance the $48.7 million pollution
abatement project, set to include a pollution-fighting fund established with the
country's largest bank, National Bank of Egypt.

<P> Environmentally friendly sources of fuel such as gas, wind and solar power
hold the key to a less polluted future. But the city's current generation seems
condemned to suffer from the motor car and factory chimney in ways their parents
could not envisage. Earlier generations saw the sun rise over pyramids and
mosques: modern inhabitants see a mix of smog and desert dust.

<a href="wl.96.06.17.html"><H3> EGYPT </H3> </a>




<H4> Private &THORN;nance is being sought for major infrastructure projects,
notably in the power and transport sectors </H4>

 <H3> If the boot &THORN;ts </H3>
<P>
<I>By Jon Marks</I>

<P> Egypt has joined the roster of countries
seeking private finance to develop infrastructure. Not that this means the state
is surrendering all responsibility. If veteran electricity and energy minister
Mohamed Maher Abaza is correct, the policy shift will create a judicious balance
of private investment to build infrastructure and some state involvement where
public sector management gives good value to consumers.

<P> There are three major power programmes slated for development using the
increasingly popular build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) method. International
attention has focused on the BOOT contract for Egypt's first independent power
project (IPP). This would build a two-by-325-MW unit to supply power to the
Egyptian Electricity Authority (EEA) from Sidi Khraier in the Nile Delta.

<P> Underlining international interest, 54 companies applied for documents for
Sidi Khraier. Between seven and 10 are expected to form a shortlist from the 34
requested to prequalify by October 31. The contract may not be awarded until next
July, according to Abaza &#173; not least so that due care is taken with very
complex documentation.

<P> Two further BOOT power plants are planned: a pump storage unit at Gallala in
Sinai and a 300-MW wind farm at Zafarana on the Gulf of Suez where, Abaza says,
wind speeds are among the highest in the world. Henceforth, "all new power
stations will be built by the private sector and privatisation is planned for
distribution companies".

<P> This does not mean an end to state activity, however. All existing power
stations will remain with the state sector, Abaza says, "because there is no need
to privatise them. They are already well-managed; indeed, we have always tried to
run them as if they were privately managed". Production costs are very low and
competitive.

<P> A measure of privatisation is planned for distribution companies, but no
dates have yet been set. Based on experience elsewhere, the transfer of
distribution into private hands can be problematic.

<P> The expected IPP boom will make headlines, but as Cairo tightens its spending
belt the government is opening the way for innovative private sector financing
techniques in the transport and water sectors. The potential for BOOT schemes
extends to a planned airport at Marsa Allum on the Red Sea, for which 37 bids
have been already been received. "This will be needed in three to five years as
tourism projects develop," comments tourism minister Mamdouh el-Beltagui. Four
toll-road schemes are also to be offered for tender. Private water projects are
envisaged but may be more difficult to implement.

<P><B> Multilateral support for private sector </B> <P> As an incentive for
private participation, international organisations are ready to provide strong
support. For the Sidi Khraier power scheme, for example, commitments have come
from agencies including the World Bank and its investment arm, the International
Finance Corporation.

<P> But securing international guarantees may not be easy. The World Bank's offer
to support aspects of commercial risk is dependent on the government providing
counter-guarantees. Ministers say they are unconvinced of the need to provide
sovereign guarantees for private-sector schemes. They argue that if
infrastructure is to be opened up to investors, they should take the risk.

<P> Such backing is essential as only a few priority infrastructure schemes,
notably the Middle East Oil Refinery (Midor) project, continue to attract Export
Credit Agency (ECA) financing. Midor, an Egyptian/Israeli joint venture building
a refinery at Alexandria, has a regional impact in keeping with the spirit of the
Middle East peace process as it was conceived in 1993-95.

<P> But for most projects, one legacy of past debts is that cover from many ECAs
remains limited. "ECAs have been much slower than other financiers to appreciate
the changes under way since debt reduction," comments a western banker visiting
Cairo. "Consequently the government is almost forced to turn to independently
financed schemes."

<P> This sentiment is mirrored by a US official. "Investment companies are
upgrading their attitudes to Egyptian risk quicker than governments," he
concludes. "While ECA activity remains relatively low, private investment is
moving steeply upwards."

Statement by Joan Claybrook<BR>
President of Public Citizen<BR>
On FMVSS 208 and Air Bags<BR>
Transportation Subcommittee<BR>
Committee on Appropriations<BR>
House of Representatives<BR>
Washington, D.C.<BR>
December l9, l996<BR>
</center>

<P>
Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee:
<P>
I am pleased to be invited to testify before you today on Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 and air bags. I am President of Public Citizen, a national consumer advocacy organization with l20,000 members nationwide, and former Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (l977-l98l).
<P>
Safety standard 208 is the most important one ever issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  It has saved over l600 lives to date, and promises to save tens of thousands more in the future.  Air bags will also mitigate millions of serious head, facial, neck and chest injuries.  In addition, it was the spark for the enactment of mandatory safety belt use laws now in place in all but one state.  
<P>
However, there have been tragic side-effects from air bag inflation in crashes, particularly low speed crashes.  These deaths should not occur.  Some 32 children and 20 adults, most of small stature, have been killed.   Almost a third of the children were in rearward facing infant carriers which must never be used in the front seat of an air bag equipped vehicle.  Most of the other children were unrestrained, which means they were probably thrown during vehicle braking into the dashboard area where the air bag inflates.  The adult deaths likewise appear to be caused by the occupant being very close to or almost on top of the air bag located in the steering wheel.  For air bags with only one inflation force level, the forces generated by the air bag designed to protect people in higher speed crashes can be too severe for occupants right next to the air bag module when it inflates.
<P>
Airbag injuries do not occur with the same frequency in all models because some manufacturers have better airbag designs than others.  Honda has a much less aggressive airbag than other manufacturers and has no reported deaths.  The Ford Taurus and Chevrolet Corsica account for 47% of the driver side deaths (9 out of 19) but account for only 3% of driver side air bags.  And the Chrysler minivan accounts for 25% of passenger side deaths (8 out of 32) but accounts for only 8% of passenger air bags.  While these numbers are too small to be statistically valid, they certainly suggest a trend.  Very simple design changes such as mounting the airbag module in the top middle of the dash rather than at the front of the dash or recessing the module in the bottom of a dished steering wheel could make airbags much more friendly to occupants and less likely to cause injury.
<P>
There are a number of courses of action now under way that are critical to stop this terrible situation.  
<P>
First, warnings in vehicles.   The fastest way to stop fatal air bag injuries from continuing is to make sure drivers and occupants know how to ride in air-bag equipped vehicles.  The warnings in current vehicles are totally inadequate. Last month the NHTSA issued a requirement for bolder and clearer warnings installed on new vehicles beginning in 90 days to make sure parents know to place their children in the back seat and properly restrain them.  At the same time, most auto manufacturers are sending notification letters to current owners of air bag equipped vehicles notifying them about the potential dangers of proximity to the air bag when it is inflating. 
<P>
Second, informing the public.  There are a number of public information programs in progress, including government efforts,  the national Air Bag Safety Program funded by the auto and insurance industries that is being described in the hearing today, and activities by safety advocates.  With the same messages coming from all sectors, the media seem to be increasingly aware of the importance of informing the public about taking several simple precautions.  The word is definitely spreading throughout the nation.  But these efforts must continue for driving behavior to truly change. While warnings and public information should have been issued much sooner, the message now is being heard. 
<P>
Third, improved air bag designs.  In my view, this is the heart of the problem we are facing today. Unfortunately, many manufacturers have not used effective technologies designed and tested as much as 20 years ago. 
<P>
The government standard, FMVSS 208, is a broad performance standard, allowing manufacturers the opportunity to develop a variety of innovative designs to meet the safety standard.  Manufacturers could install automatic belt restraints or air bags (or any other automatic protection system that meets the injury prevention levels in the standard).  Virtually every manufacturer has now chosen to install air bags which will be fully required by statute in l998 models cars and in l999 model vans, sport utility vehicles and pick up trucks.  Many manufacturers have designed their systems quite precisely to meet the basic specifications of the standard:  a 30 mph full frontal barrier crash using a 50th percentile male test dummy automatically protected to avoid specified injury levels.   
<P>
One of the most important elements in air bag design that determines the level of protection as well as the likelihood of inadvertent injury is the inflation flow rate.  Most current vehicles on the highway have a single inflation level.  This means that whether the crash is at l5 mph or 35 mph, the air bag inflates with the same force.  But as far back as the mid-l970's, General Motors installed (albeit with stored gas and a heating charge, a different type of technology than the pyrotechnic systems being used today) dual stage inflation air bags in l0,000 l973-l976 vehicles sold to the public.  As described in a paper presented by NHTSA, private contractor and air bag supplier engineers to the 8th International Experimental Safety Vehicle Conference in Wolfsburg, West Germany in October l980, "For low level deployment the stored gas only was used while for high level deployment the solid propellant charge heated the stored gas for augmented flow." (p. 343).
<P>
While the numbers are too small to be statistically valid, I would note that in several hundred crashes involving over 300 hundred occupants, including more than a dozen children and some small adults in these l970's GM cars, the injury effects we are seeing today were not evident.  It is also noteworthy that child passenger safety was an issue GM was concerned about in designing these systems.  As long ago as l972, GM engineers in a Society of Automotive Engineers paper, reported "favorable results" testing standing child dummies using air bags with "...variable inflation, which lessens the initial deployment surge to ease the action of the cushion on the occupants..." (Klove and Oglesby, Publication No. 720411).
<P>
The l980 Wolfsburg paper was derived from NHTSA funded research on how to protect out-of-position, unrestrained child occupants in crashes.  The paper summarizes the "design wisdom" of dual inflation systems as follows:  "The passenger bag should not, to the extent possible, be deployed at a faster rate than is justified by the crash severity." (p.349)  
<P>
I want to emphasize that designing an air bag is a complex task for engineering experts and involves many factors, including the vehicle crash pulse, bag fabric weight and mass, shape and volume, folding, location of the mounting in the dashboard, cover opening and other variables.  However, it appears that the protection needed for various size occupants can be provided by dual or multi-stage inflation systems. But this uncomplicated technology has been largely ignored by manufacturers of today's air bag equipped vehicles and should be reviewed as part of NHTSA's forthcoming rulemaking for higher technology air bags to protect vulnerable populations.  
<P>
It is for this reason that Public Citizen and the Center for Auto Safety petitioned the NHTSA in November to issue a proposal for dual stage inflation air bag systems.  These systems can be designed and installed in the short term, far sooner than much of the 2lst Century "smart", high tech systems, and the additional cost is very small.
<P>
Air bag suppliers as reported in the NHTSA docket have already developed dual stage systems that inflate with less force in low speed crashes and more in high speed.  In addition,  Mercedes and BMW already offer designs that distinguish not only the force of the crash but whether occupants are wearing belts.  These systems generally require electronic sensors, but many manufacturers have already moved from mechanical to electronic sensors (the electronic, single point sensors can be cheaper than using mechanical sensors).  We urge NHTSA to encourage these near-term technology systems as well as development of more sophisticated systems in its forthcoming rulemaking.  The car buying public should be able to purchase the next generation of safer air bags as rapidly as possible.  (I would note that the Washington Post reported on December 17, 1996 that TRW, a major air bag supplier, purchased a Canadian-based supplier of electronic devices, including sensors.)
<P>
The timing is particularly important to consumers because the auto industry has petitioned the government to permit a depowering of current air bag designs for the next few model years and to allow certification with sled tests rather than full scale crash tests.  Consumer organizations have reluctantly decided not to object to this proposal because we are extremely concerned about the fatal and other serious injuries now occurring and trust that some of them, particularly harm to small adults, can be mitigated with depowering.  Depowering is only a short term partial fix for air bags that need to be redesigned. But we also are deeply concerned there will be a tradeoff for adults in higher speed crashes.  In addition, substitution of sled tests, which are advantageous because they are much cheaper and faster than crash tests, can be manipulated to substantially reduce the protection achieved with air bags.  Permanent depowering of airbags is projected to kill more people than it would save.
<P>
The American Automobile Manufacturers Association agrees that depowering is a temporary measure until better technology is incorporated.  Thus, protective systems that can be incorporated in the next few years, such as dual inflation systems, have great appeal now over much more complex, higher technology systems that may take additional years to test and produce.  
<P>
Fourth, disabling air bags.   Consumer groups have opposed the on/off switch proposed by NHTSA (except for vehicles with no rear seat), as well as disconnecting air bags that NHTSA has indicated it will propose, because in the end we believe more people will be killed and seriously injured than will be helped. For example, Dainius Dalates of Canada DOT and Kennerly Digges, former Deputy Administrator of Research at NHTSA authored a paper for the last Experimental Safety Vehicle conference showing reduction of head injury with air bags for belted occupants in frontal crashes of at least 65% compared to belted only occupants.  And as described above, there are available remedies other than on/off switches that are far superior for investment of industry resources.  As well, other witnesses today will describe information developed by insurance companies and the government that should be made more readily available to consumers about air bag performance in current cars and how to purchase the car that best fits the buyers needs, thus reducing concerns that might lead the owner to want to disconnect the air bag.
<P>
Also, disconnecting or turning off the air bag wrongly implies that children should ride in the front seat.  We believe this sends the wrong message to parents, as children are far better protected in the rear seat in an air bag or non-air bag car.  In addition, for the government to suggest that disconnection is acceptable only further sparks public anxiety, much of which is unfounded.
<P>
Fifth, built-in rear child restraints.   Some manufacturers, such as Volvo and Chrysler, are building child restraint systems into the back seats of their vehicles.  Built-in child restraints assure compatibility between the restraint and the vehicle, are usually easier to operate, make it clear the child belongs in the rear seat, and are useful for owners without young children who occasionally transport children in their vehicles.   NHTSA should develop a performance standard requiring these restraints be in the rear seats of all new cars.
<P>
In summary, Mr. Chairman, the government, motor vehicle-related businesses and consumer organizations all have a common interest in getting the message to citizens across the nation about putting their children in proper restraints in the rear seat and allowing about l0 inches between the belted driver and the steering hub for maximum safety in current air bag equipped vehicles.  
<P>
We also have a common interest in getting the next generation of air bag systems with improved technologies (not necessarily highly complex ones) into the marketplace as rapidly as possible, certainly within the next few years.  With the loss of life on our roads every day almost equivalent to a Value-Jet crash, we must all rise to the challenge of enhancing the proven life-saving advantages of air bags while removing the risks of unnecessary injury.
<P>
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this important issue.

Statement By Joan Claybrook<BR>
President of Public Citizen<BR>
November 22, 1996<BR>
<P>
<P>
	The Department of Transportation actions today are long overdue and should begin the process for improving air bag designs, but unfortunately the authorization for disconnecting air bags could cause mass confusion because it appears to contradict the req
uired label warning that young children should be properly restrained and seated in the rear.
<P>
	For the government to authorize disconnection sends the wrong message to motorists who will interpret this as a recommendation to disconnect. No doubt citizens who have their air bags disconnected will be required to sign liability waivers, surrendering 
their legal rights, and paperwork records will have to be maintained for years to reference in crash investigations, lawsuits and vehicle transfers.
<P>
	The solution lies in long-overdue "smart" technology. This has been delayed because the auto industry chose not to develop smarter, safer air bags despite knowing of the potential dangers for many years. Depowering appears to be the only feasible interim
 solution until more advanced designs go into production.  
<P>
	Among the most promising technological short-term solutions would be dual-inflation air bags that inflate more slowly in low-speed crashes and faster in high-speed crashes. They could be in production within the next two years and would add little to the
 cost -- $10-20 per car. These systems would improve air bag safety for children and small adults.  There must be no compromise on the date for the introduction of smart air bags - there has been too much delay already.
<P>
	The warning labels are clearly needed as soon as possible.  Air bag injuries to children can be eliminated <u>immediately</u> if children are properly restrained in the back seat.  The toddlers who died so tragically -- with one or two possible exception
s -- were all unrestrained or improperly restrained.  The safest place for children 12 and younger is in the back seat, with safety belts buckled.  Infants in rear-facing seats should never be in front seat.  If children are in front seat, they should alw
ays be restrained and the seat should be back as far as possible.
<P>
	All drivers and passengers of any age, weight or size should use safety belts at all times.  Shorter, lighter drivers should be sure to stay 6-10" back from the air bag module in the steering wheel.  These common-sense precautions increase safety immedia
tely, in all kinds of crashes, with or without air bags.
<P>
	Air bags save hundreds of lives and reduce injuries -- particularly brain, head and facial injuries -- to thousands of other crash victims.  Every day on America's roads there is a loss of life equivalent to a Value-Jet crash. The challenge to all involv
ed with auto-safety is to preserve the proven life-saving advantages of air bags while eliminating the risk of injury.

This year, the nuclear industry is lobbying Congress to force a
high-level nuclear waste dump upon the state of Nevada.  The
industry is backing legislation, that would slash environmental
standards, preempt state and local laws, and begin the largest
nuclear waste transportation project in history.
<P>
Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project is part of a
coalition of citizens groups that oppose the industry's efforts.

Washington DC --
A national public opinion survey conducted immediately following the
November election, and released today by a national coalition of business,
environmental, consumer, and energy policy organizations, found broad,
consistent, and bi-partisan support for federal funding, tax incentives,
and appliance efficiency standards to promote renewable energy and energy
efficient technology programs.  However, little support exists for fossil
fuels such as coal and oil or for nuclear power technologies like
pyroprocessing.  With most Americans viewing global climate change as a
serious environmental threat, the majority favor the United States signing
an international agreement to set a binding deadline for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions.  Finally, as Congress and many states consider
legislation to deregulate the electric utility industry, voters made clear
that they want provisions included to mandate renewable energy, energy
efficiency, and environmental protection and they want utilities and
shareholders -- not consumers -- to bear the cost for uneconomic "stranded
nuclear assets."  These are among the key findings of the survey, "America
Speaks Out on Energy: A Survey of 1996 Post-Election Views" conducted for
the Sustainable Energy Coalition by the Republican polling firm of
Research/Strategy/Management, Inc. of Lanham, MD from November 9 to 14
among a sample of 1,200 registered voters.  The survey, which is being
simultaneously co-released by 22 other organizations in 16 states, has a
margin of error of +/-2.9%.  The 15 questions addressed federal funding of
energy research and development, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency's (EPA) Green Lights and Energy Star programs, nuclear
pyroprocessing, tax support for ethanol and other energy sources,
appliance efficiency standards, the seriousness of global climate change,
and an international agreement to control greenhouse gas emissions.  In
addition, the survey posed a series of questions on the topic of
restructuring the electric utility industry, which the new Congress is
expected to begin debating early next year.  Specific topics addressed
include mandating that electricity generators include renewable energy
sources in their mix; using a Renewable Portfolio Standard to promote
increased use of renewables, requiring utilities to invest in energy
efficiency measures, disposing of so-called "stranded nuclear assets;" 
and establishing comparable environmental standards for all utility
fossil-fueled plants.  Key findings include: 

	Federal Energy Budget Issues For the third year in a row, a
majority (56%) of all voters, and nearly two-thirds (66%) of those
expressing a preference, would give the highest priority to funding the
U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) renewable energy and energy efficiency
research and development (R&D) programs.  On the other hand, nearly a
third (31%) of respondents selected nuclear power as the first R&D program
that should be subject to budget cuts, followed by fossil fuels (21%).  A
plurality (45%) of voters favor maintaining funding for EPA's Green
Lights, Energy Star and other voluntary energy efficiency programs at the
current levels, and 24% favor increased funding.  A plurality (44%) of
voters also oppose Congress funding the nuclear pyroprocessing program. 
Opposition is particularly strong among Republicans and Independents,
where 54% of voters expressing an opinion were opposed to continued
funding. 

	Tax Incentives and Priorities Although 73% of respondents said
that cutting taxes made at least some difference in how they voted for
Congress, a majority (52%) of all voters, and nearly two-thirds (62%) of
those stating a preference, supported tax incentives for either renewable
energy or energy efficiency efforts.  Support for natural gas, other
fossil fuels, and nuclear power tax incentives only measured in the single
digits for each.  Moreover, an overwhelming majority (83%) noted their
preference for redirecting tax breaks to renewable fuels while only 10%
felt they should continue to be given to oil companies.  Nearly
three-quarters of voters (71%) also support continuing the federal tax
exemption for ethanol-blended gasoline while only 20% are opposed. 

	Appliance Efficiency Standards Nearly two-thirds (65%) of voters,
including a majority of Republicans (53%), favor strengthening appliance
efficiency standards.  This support exists even though a majority of
respondents (56% vs. 35%) -- when asked about the role of government in
the economy -- believe that the government is generally doing too many
things.  In response to a similar question asked a year ago, only 48% of
voters favored having the government continue to strengthen appliance
efficiency standards while 46% preferred letting the market place
determine new standards. 

	Climate Change; Signing an International Agreement For the second
year in a row, over seventy percent (71%) of voters said they viewed
global climate change as a serious threat.  This view extends across all
political party affiliations including Reform Party members (83%),
Democrats (82%), Independents (72%), and Republicans (56%).  Half of all
respondents said they were in favor of the United States signing an
international agreement that would set a legally binding deadline for
reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  A fifth of voters (20%) are somewhat
opposed while only 21% strongly oppose signing such a treaty.  The
strongest support comes from voters (66%) who cast their ballot in the
November 1996 election for President Clinton, whose Administration will be
taking the lead in negotiating a treaty throughout the coming year. 

	Electric Utility Restructuring A majority (53%) of voters favor
Congress requiring electricity companies to use renewable energy sources
while 44% would leave the choice up to the companies' discretion.  Even
stronger support (57%) was expressed for including a Renewable Portfolio
Standard (that would direct electricity generators to include a percentage
of renewables in their energy mix) in federal electric utility
restructuring legislation even if it means higher utility bills.  By a
large majority (69%), voters favor requiring utilities to invest in energy
efficiency programs; only 10% of voters strongly oppose such a requirement
while 16% are somewhat opposed.  This view is particularly strong among
voters (84%) who believe the environment should be a top congressional
priority in 1997.  By a lopsided margin (70%), voters felt that utilities
and their shareholders should be primarily responsible for paying the debt
on existing nuclear power plants that may not be able to compete in a
restructured utility market.  Only 14% thought that the consumers served
by these utilities should pay for these so-called "stranded assets" while
8% indicated that the general public should pay through their taxes. 
Finally, a majority of voters (53%) "strongly favor" strong environmental
standards that would apply equally to all fossil fuel power plants while
another 27% "somewhat favor" such standards for a combined total of 80%. 
This view is shared by people of all political stripe including voters
(68%) who define themselves as very conservative.  The Sustainable Energy
Coalition is a coalition of 40+ national business, environmental,
consumer, and energy policy organizations (list available upon request)
founded in 1992 to encourage a shift in federal energy priorities to favor
renewable energy and energy efficiency.

Conference Statement</A>
<P>
<STRONG>1.) Do you support abolition of the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE)?</STRONG><P>

<P><STRONG>Clinton</STRONG>:  No.  The President has already
ordered substantial reductions in the size of the Department to
make it more efficient.  By 2000, the Administration's plan will
have saved taxpayers more than $10 billion.  Essential functions
of
the Department -- such as research and development, efficiency
programs and critical defense programs -- should be preserved. 
Republican proposals to dismantle the Department would either
save
money by shirking essential missions or simply transfer functions
to other departments without saving taxpayers anything.

<P><STRONG>Alexander</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Buchanan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Dole</STRONG>:  Yes.  Bob Dole supports abolition of
the
U.S. Department of Energy because of the need to downsize the
Federal government and because the Department of Energy serves
little purpose in obtaining energy or environmental benefits in
the
public interest.  The Department of Energy is one of four cabinet
agencies which together spend more than $74 billion per year and
whose elimination Bob Dole has called for in his initiative to
streamline the entire Federal bureaucracy.

<P><STRONG>Dornan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Forbes</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Gramm</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Keyes</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Lugar</STRONG>:  No.  Not at this time.  However, if
reliable analysis determined that the essential functions of DOE
could be more efficiently allocated to existing departments as
part
of a general reorganization of the Executive Branch, I would
consider supporting such a reorganization.

<P><STRONG>Taylor</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>
2.) Do you support federal "takings" legislation that would
require
payment if federal environmental regulations reduce property
values?</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Clinton</STRONG>:  No.  The Administration supports
protecting private property.  If the government takes someone's
property, the government should pay.  That's what the
Constitution
says and that is what the President demands of his government. 
But, the so-called "takings" legislation introduced as part of
the
Republicans' Contract with America goes beyond Constitutional
protections: It would cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars
and weaken safeguards for public health, safety, and the
environment.  The President has said he would veto these types of
bills.

<P><STRONG>Alexander</STRONG>:  Yes.  I support the
constitutional
principle that property should not be taken without just
compensation.  When I was Governor of Tennessee, I was able to
protect wetlands with a bill that specifically prohibited the
taking of property by condemnation or by eminent domain.

<P><STRONG>Buchanan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Dole</STRONG>:  Yes.  Bob Dole supports Federal
legislation that protects the private property rights of American
citizens from invasion by the Federal government consistent with
the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and has introduced
legislation in the Senate to achieve that objective.

<P><STRONG>Dornan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Forbes</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Gramm</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Keyes</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Lugar</STRONG>:  The Constitution already requires
that
landowners be compensated for takings of their private property. 
I am skeptical that Congress should try to improve upon the work
of
the courts in defining a taking or determining what is just
compensation.

<P><STRONG>Taylor</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>
3.) Do you support opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to
oil exploration and drilling?</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Clinton</STRONG>:  No.  The Arctic Refuge is a rare,
pristine wilderness that should be preserved for future
generations.  There are substantial state and federal lands that
can be developed in Alaska without disturbing the Refuge.  And
since there is more oil in energy efficiency than can be
extracted
from the Arctic Refuge, drilling is as unnecessary as it is
unwise.

<P><STRONG>Alexander</STRONG>:  Yes.  I favor opening ANWR for
oil
and natural gas exploration.  I believe that such a step is
important for increasing our domestic oil production while
decreasing our dependence on foreign oil.  Although I oppose
opening some areas to oil drilling -- off the coast of Florida
would be one area -- I am convinced that the technology now
exists
to begin limited oil and gas exploration in ANWR in a way that
would be safe for the environment.

<P><STRONG>Buchanan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Dole</STRONG>:  Yes.  Bob Dole supports allowing oil
and
gas development on the Coastal Plain -- a small portion -- of the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge because it can be done safely and
responsibly without damage to the environment, and because
careful
development of America's oil and natural gas resources
contributes
to economic growth, creates American jobs, enhances our nation's
energy security and reduces dependence on foreign oil.

<P><STRONG>Dornan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Forbes</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Gramm</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Keyes</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Lugar</STRONG>:  Yes.  I would support it on the
assumption that strict regulations and advanced technology will
protect wildlife.

<P><STRONG>Taylor</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>
4.) Do you favor raising the Corporate Average Fuel Economy
standards for new cars to 45 mpg and for new light trucks to 35
mpg
by the year 2005?</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Clinton</STRONG>:  No.  The Administration strongly
supports improving fuel efficiency, and believes CAFE has been a
useful tool to increase fuel economy in the past.  However, the
fast-paced increase suggested by the question runs a strong risk
of
not being cost-effective and of being counterproductive.  In
September 1993, the President initiated a new partnership with
the
domestic auto industry and labor to develop a new generation of
high-performance, affordable vehicles up to three times more fuel
efficient than today's models.  Early developments are promising.

<P><STRONG>Alexander</STRONG>:  No.

<P><STRONG>Buchanan</STRONG>:  No.

<P><STRONG>Dole</STRONG>:  No.  Bob Dole supports saving energy
in
the transportation sector, but he believes that additional
Federal
regulatory mandates such as raising Corporate Average Fuel
Economy
("CAFE") standards are not the best way to obtain more energy
efficient cars and trucks.  Bob Dole advocates greater use of
alternative fuels like ethanol to reduce emissions and increase
energy security.  Bob Dole also advocates taking a harder look at
market-based mechanisms to get the really inefficient and
polluting
cars off the road.

<P><STRONG>Dornan</STRONG>:  No.

<P><STRONG>Forbes</STRONG>:  No.

<P><STRONG>Gramm</STRONG>:  I am opposed to arbitrary government
mandates that can lead to increased burdensome government
intervention and increased costs to the consumer.

<P><STRONG>Keyes</STRONG>:  No.  CAFE kills 2,000 - 4,000 people
a year by making larger, safer cars less affordable.  It's an
assault on the family car and should be abolished.

<P><STRONG>Lugar</STRONG>:  No, but I support the current CAFE
standards, which have doubled the energy efficiency of our
automobile fleet.

<P><STRONG>Taylor</STRONG>:  Yes.  Increase ethanol/fuel ratio to
30/70 from 15/85.

<P><STRONG>
5.) Do you support the construction of new nuclear power plants
in
the U.S.?</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Clinton</STRONG>:  New nuclear power plants are not
being built today for two economic reasons:  first, they are
extremely expensive -- more costly than both conservation
measures
and other sources of electricity generation; and second,
nationwide
conservation and utility deregulation have reduced the demand for
huge new plants.  The Administration supports research and
development funding to help develop more cost-effective nuclear
plant designs.  Ultimately, however, the market and the public
must
choose the technology and fuels for future electricity generation
-
- not the government.

<P><STRONG>Alexander</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Buchanan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Dole</STRONG>:  Bob Dole supports a diversified energy
supply system.  If nuclear power is selected as the economic
choice, and otherwise meets all health and safety licensing
requirements, Bob Dole supports the right of companies to choose
nuclear power technology.  However, one of the most pressing
problems facing the nuclear energy industry is the disposal of
nuclear waste.  This problem has not been adequately addressed by
the Clinton Administration and needs to be resolved.

<P><STRONG>Dornan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Forbes</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Gramm</STRONG>:  Federal safety standards governing
the
construction of nuclear facilities should continue.  States and
localities should decide for themselves if they want nuclear
power
plants in their communities.

<P><STRONG>Keyes</STRONG>:  Yes, provided the nuclear plants are
not built with tax dollars.

<P><STRONG>Lugar</STRONG>:  I would not rule out such
construction
if a particular nuclear plant is an economical and safe option. 
Nuclear power could help combat the threat of global warming.

<P><STRONG>Taylor</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>
6.) Do you support cuts of 25 percent in the DOE energy
efficiency
and renewable energy programs?</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Clinton</STRONG>:  No.  These programs save consumers
money, create jobs, help new technologies gain market share in
the
U.S. and abroad, and reduce the gases that cause global climate
change and other air pollution.  That's why the President has
expanded funding for these programs -- more than 40 percent for
conservation and renewables (measured from the last Bush budget
to
the 1996 Clinton request).  Many of these programs engage the
private sector in voluntary energy-saving efforts that help
improve
productivity -- and generate significant economic and
environmental
benefits for each taxpayer dollar invested.

<P><STRONG>Alexander</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Buchanan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Dole</STRONG>:  Yes.  DOE's energy efficiency and
renewable energy programs, like many other worthy programs in the
Federal government, must bear their share of the budget restraint
necessary to obtain a balanced budget.  Federal funding for
energy
conservation programs and for renewable energy programs increased
27.5% and 42% respectively, from FY'1993 to FY'1995.  These
substantial increases came on top of a doubling of energy
conservation research and development funding and a 65% increase
in
renewable energy funding during the Bush Administration.  The
Congress has approved approximately $800 million in FY'1996
funding
for DOE's energy conservation and renewable energy programs. 
This
seems adequate.

<P><STRONG>Dornan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Forbes</STRONG>:  Additional cuts may be needed so I
have not yet established a funding level.

<P><STRONG>Gramm</STRONG>:  As President, I will eliminate the
Department of Energy.

<P><STRONG>Keyes</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Lugar</STRONG>:  No, but in the context of addressing
our budget predicament, all federal programs, including DOE
programs, must be eligible to take some cuts.

<P><STRONG>Taylor</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>
7.) Do you support ensuring that the government receives a fair
market return for publicly owned minerals extracted by private
mining companies on federal land?</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Clinton</STRONG>:  Yes.  Mining companies should pay a
fair share.  At a time when Republicans in Congress are cutting
Medicare and Medicaid and raising taxes on working families in
order to balance the budget, it is wrong that mining companies
can
take public minerals worth $1 billion for as little as $275.  I
believe the current laws should be reformed.

<P><STRONG>Alexander</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Buchanan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Dole</STRONG>:  While Bob Dole supports reform of out-
dated mining laws, he opposes efforts that would put miners and
others in related activities out of work, severely impact the
economy in our Western states and actually decrease Federal
revenues.  Fees for mineral extraction on Federal lands should be
set in a way that promotes responsible development of our
nation's
mineral resources to support economic growth and create jobs. 
Such
fees also need to reflect the Federal government's fiscal
responsibilities to the American taxpayers to balance the budget
and manage Federal resources.

<P><STRONG>Dornan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Forbes</STRONG>:  I support the principle of a fair
market return but have endorsed no specific plan as of now.

<P><STRONG>Gramm</STRONG>:  I support revising the 1872 mining
law
and increasing the amounts charged to mining companies using
federal lands.

<P><STRONG>Keyes</STRONG>:  Yes, provided market value is
determined by some kind of auction or competitive bidding.

<P><STRONG>Lugar</STRONG>:  Yes, although we should recognize
that
there are differences about what constitutes a fair market rate
that must be resolved.  I would favor an increase of some type in
the fees that mining companies pay for extracting minerals on
public lands.

<P><STRONG>Taylor</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>
8.) Do you support the proposed cuts in funding (40%) for HHS'
Low
Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and DOE's
Weatherization Assistance Program?</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Clinton</STRONG>:  No.  In the past two years, we have
witnessed severe weather -- the brutal winter of 1993-94 in the
East, the hot summer of 1995 in the Midwest, and the blizzard of
1996 which we are now facing -- where many poor and elderly
citizens face life-threatening situations.  LIHEAP helps these
citizens pay their bills and offers them an important lifeline. 
Weatherization continues to be a very cost-effective way to help
poor families, who spend about three times the proportion of
their
family budgets on fuel and utility bills than average.

<P><STRONG>Alexander</STRONG>:  Yes.  I support cuts in these
programs to help balance the budget.

<P><STRONG>Buchanan</STRONG>:  No Response.

<P><STRONG>Dole</STRONG>:  Again, Bob Dole supports HHS' Low
Income
Home Energy Assistance program and DOE's weatherization
assistance
program and understands the importance of these programs to the
State of New Hampshire.  The issues are:  (1) how much should be
spent on these programs given other competing priorities; (2) the
need to balance the budget; and (3) who should bear financial
responsibility for these programs, the Federal government or the
states.  In general, he believes the states should have more say
about how to use Federal resources to provide for the welfare of
their citizens.  Whether states choose to use those resources for
low income energy assistance or weatherization should be a
judgment
for states to make, not the Federal government.

<P><STRONG>Dornan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Forbes</STRONG>:  I have established no specific
funding
level.

<P><STRONG>Gramm</STRONG>:  I have voted in favor of increased
funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program and
sought to reduce spending on other programs of lower priority in
order to pay for it.

<P><STRONG>Keyes</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Lugar</STRONG>:  No.  I strongly support the low
income
home energy assistance and weatherization programs.

<P><STRONG>Taylor</STRONG>:  No.

<P><STRONG>
9.) Do you support the phase-out of new appliance efficiency and
building energy code standards?</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Clinton</STRONG>:  No.  These standards have saved
consumers billions of dollars in the past 10 years.  Moreover,
new
appliance standards are set by consulting with manufacturers to
ensure that standards are cost-effective and in the best
interests
of both consumers and appliance producers.  Building energy codes
remain the cheapest, most efficient way to increase energy
efficiency in homes and offices, and federal guidance is
necessary
because state and local programs don't always have the resources
to
develop their own codes.

<P><STRONG>Alexander</STRONG>:  No.  They do need to be reformed,
however, to eliminate the most burdensome regulations.  Many
builders have already invested money to conform with existing
codes.

<P><STRONG>Buchanan</STRONG>:  No Response.

<P><STRONG>Dole</STRONG>:  Bob Dole supports providing consumers
with the information they need to choose the level of efficiency
they want to pay for.  He does not support Federal mandates or
regulations that deny consumers choice and affordable appliances
or
cost American jobs.

<P><STRONG>Dornan</STRONG>:  Yes, (as regards to new appliance
efficiency standards; building energy codes are a matter of state
law)

<P><STRONG>Forbes</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Gramm</STRONG>:  Consumers should determine which
product(s) in the marketplace is superior based on available
information provided by the manufacturer.

<P><STRONG>Keyes</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Lugar</STRONG>:  No.  I helped persuade President
Reagan
to sign national appliance efficiency standards into law.

<P><STRONG>Taylor</STRONG>:  No.

<P><STRONG>
10.) Do you support cutting U.S. so-called greenhouse gas
emissions
to 1990 levels by the year 2000?</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Clinton</STRONG>:  Yes.  On Earth Day 1993, shortly
after taking office, President Clinton made a commitment to cut
emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000 --
a
commitment previous Presidents refused to make.

<P><STRONG>Alexander</STRONG>:  No.  Greenhouse gas emissions are
a serious issue, and we should rely on the best science to make
policy.  But this is not exclusively an American problem.  It
should be dealt with in conjunction with other countries.  The
U.S.
should not place its businesses at an economic disadvantage by
acting unilaterally.

<P><STRONG>Buchanan</STRONG>:  No Response.

<P><STRONG>Dole</STRONG>:  Bob Dole supports the commitment made
by
President Bush to prepare a plan with the objective of returning
U.S. greenhouse gas levels in the year 2000 to 1990 levels
through
voluntary measures.

<P><STRONG>Dornan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Forbes</STRONG>:  I question the need for restricting
the United States' ability to create jobs for our people based on
global warming theory which is unproven.

<P><STRONG>Gramm</STRONG>:  I support market-driven energy
efficiency and oppose artificial government mandates implemented
by
EPA regulations.

<P><STRONG>Keyes</STRONG>:  No.

<P><STRONG>Lugar</STRONG>:  I supported the 1992 Climate Change
Convention, which called on all nations to stabilize emissions of
greenhouse gases.

<P><STRONG>Taylor</STRONG>:  No Response.

<P><STRONG>
11.) Do you support establishment of an interim storage
high-level
nuclear waste site in Nevada?</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Clinton</STRONG>:  No.  The Administration opposes
building anywhere a temporary storage facility for high-level
waste
until scientific investigation on a permanent disposal site is
farther along.  The Administration believes that we should focus
on
funding and completing the scientific examination of the
permanent
underground disposal repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  We
should make the decision about where and when to build an interim
site after we know more about Yucca Mountain's suitability as a
permanent repository.

<P><STRONG>Alexander</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Buchanan</STRONG>:  No Response.

<P><STRONG>Dole</STRONG>:  Bob Dole supports the siting of an
interim storage facility for high-level nuclear waste.  He
believes
that determinations regarding the siting of that facility should
be
left to the legislative process, through the authorizing
committees
of the Congress working with those deeply involved in the high-
level nuclear waste program.

<P><STRONG>Dornan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Forbes</STRONG>:  Undecided pending further study.

<P><STRONG>Gramm</STRONG>:  I believe it is appropriate that the
Federal government should be involved with the disposal of
nuclear
waste, and the government will need to work closely with
individual
states to best determine the future of interim and long term
storage issues.

<P><STRONG>Keyes</STRONG>:  Undecided.

<P><STRONG>Lugar</STRONG>:  Yes, if needed to avoid premature
licensing of a permanent storage facility.

<P><STRONG>Taylor</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>
12.) Do you support transfer of federal land for the proposed
Ward
Valley, California low-level nuclear waste facility?</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Clinton</STRONG>:  Yes, if the proper health and
safety
standards are in place.  Unfortunately, the state of California
(to
whom the site would be transferred) and Republicans in Congress
believe the site should be transferred without any binding
commitments for public safeguards.  The President opposes that
measure, and vetoed it with the rest of the GOP budget (the
reconciliation bill).

<P><STRONG>Alexander</STRONG>:  Yes.  I am not familiar with the
details of the proposal, but I would support it provided the
project is scientifically and environmentally sound.

<P><STRONG>Buchanan</STRONG>:  No Response.

<P><STRONG>Dole</STRONG>:  Yes.  Ward Valley is the site selected
by state officials charged with the responsibility of siting a
low-
level nuclear waste facility.  Independent scientific assessments
have demonstrated no reason why Ward Valley is not a suitable
site
for such a facility.  Bob Dole believes, therefore, that the
Federal government should accommodate the choice that the states
have made.

<P><STRONG>Dornan</STRONG>:  Decision is made at [the] state
[level]; local issue.

<P><STRONG>Forbes</STRONG>:  Undecided pending further study.

<P><STRONG>Gramm</STRONG>:  I believe it is appropriate that the
Federal government should be involved with the disposal of
nuclear
waste, and the government will need to work closely with
individual
states to best determine the future of interim and long term
storage issues.

<P><STRONG>Keyes</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Lugar</STRONG>:  Yes.  The National Academy of
Sciences
endorsed this concept.

<P><STRONG>Taylor</STRONG>:  No Response.

<P><STRONG>
13.) Do you support reauthorization and strict enforcement of the
Endangered Species Act?</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Clinton</STRONG>:  Yes.  The President supports a
strong
Endangered Species Act (ESA) that protects wildlife and provides
more flexibility to landowners and more involvement for the
states. 
Without waiting for Congress, the Administration has already
launched reforms of the ESA that will ensure that the vast
majority
of homeowners never again have to worry about ESA restrictions.

<P><STRONG>Alexander</STRONG>:  Some of the extreme applications
of
the Endangered Species Act have become somewhat silly, costing
jobs
and drifting away from the original purpose of the Act.  That was
the case in Tennessee when the allegedly "endangered" snail
darter
almost prevented our state from building a dam.  We later learned
that the snail darter was not endangered at all, which is why we
need a better, more scientific system of determining whether a
species is actually endangered.  I think there is a way of
reforming the Endangered Species Act that is less onerous to
property owners, gives more incentives to property owners to
protect endangered species, but still retains federal protection
of
endangered species and their habitats.

<P><STRONG>Buchanan</STRONG>:  No.

<P><STRONG>Dole</STRONG>:  The Endangered Species Act ("ESA") is
in
need of reform.  It has been a divisive and costly mechanism that
-
- while playing a role in the return of formerly endangered
species
such as the bald eagle -- has effectively placed the judiciary in
charge of commerce and land management in significant portions of
the West and Northwest.  The bitterness and controversy
surrounding
the ESA works <EM>against</EM> the responsible environmental
stewardship that needs to be encouraged on the part of all
Americans.

<P><STRONG>Dornan</STRONG>:  No.

<P><STRONG>Forbes</STRONG>:  No, unless common sense amendments
are
adopted to stop prosecution of farmers who run over endangered
rats
while plowing their fields and similar ridiculous situations.

<P><STRONG>Gramm</STRONG>:  I support a rational, science-based
endangered species law which respects private property and
individual jobs.  I believe the most important environmental
reform
we can adopt is to guarantee the protection of private property.

<P><STRONG>Keyes</STRONG>:  No.  I support the Shadegg bill --
voluntary, incentive-based conservation.

<P><STRONG>Lugar</STRONG>:  Yes, but the scope of the ESA needs
clarification.

<P><STRONG>Taylor</STRONG>:  No.  Enforcement should consider
economic impact and environmental impact.

<P><STRONG>
14.) Do you support application of probabilistic risk assessment
and cost/benefit tests to all new and existing federal
environmental and energy regulation?</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Clinton</STRONG>:  Yes.  The Administration supports
risk assessment and cost/benefit analysis for new and existing
regulations, when the analysis is commensurate with the
significance of the decision, and would improve the regulatory
system.  The Administration cannot support a risk assessment or
cost/benefit scheme that would cause undue delay or litigation or
would roll back health, safety, and environmental protection.

<P><STRONG>Alexander</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Buchanan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Dole</STRONG>:  Yes.  While we have made enormous
improvements in reducing environmental pollution, Bob Dole
believes
that the current environmental regulatory approach is flawed.  We
need to learn from the last 25 years of Federal environmental
regulation to determine how to best achieve our environmental
goals
for this and future generations.  Americans have spent about $2
trillion on direct compliance with Federal environmental
regulations since 1970.  In a study done for GAO in 1992,
Professor
Thomas Hopkins of the Rochester Institute of Technology projected
that Americans would be spending at least $170 billion a year on
direct compliance with environmental regulations by 1995 -- an
amount that is more than double (in constant dollars) what he
estimated was spent in 1985.  Risk assessment and cost/benefit
tests are not an attempt to "roll back" environmental
protections,
but rather are an effort to ensure that as we move forward to
protect our environment we do so wisely.  We must emphasize sound
science, prioritize our efforts, be careful of pursuing small
risks
at great costs and understand that spending more to chase slight
or
sensational risks means less state, local and individual
resources
are available to meet other health or societal needs.  Bob Dole
believes that we can afford to apply a little common sense to
environmental regulation.  In fact, we cannot afford <EM>not</EM>
to.

<P><STRONG>Dornan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Forbes</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Gramm</STRONG>:  Yes.  I believe that all regulatory
legislation Congress considers should be subject to risk
assessment
or cost-benefit studies.  Business, local governments, families
and
individuals make cost-benefit decisions every day on how to spend
their money and ensure that expenditures are cost-effective.  The
Federal Government, particularly the EPA and other regulatory
agencies that thrive on imposing new rules, should be subject to
similar standards.  They don't follow those standards now because
the money being spent is not their own; it's ours.

<P><STRONG>Keyes</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Lugar</STRONG>:  Yes, in order to achieve strict
environmental standards at reasonable costs such as we did in
controlling acid rain.

<P><STRONG>Taylor</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>
15.) Do you support the proposed cuts (about 35%) in the EPA
budget?</STRONG>

<P><STRONG>Clinton</STRONG>:  No.  The President is strongly
opposed to cuts of this magnitude, which would put public health
and safety at risk.  He vetoed the Republican EPA appropriations
bill in large part because it would have cut EPA's funding 22
percent from the President's request.  (The vetoed bill had been
improved slightly in the House/Senate conference from the 35% cut
cited in the question, which was the House level.)

<P><STRONG>Alexander</STRONG>:  One of the proposed cuts in EPA
funding would have cut the money for state efforts to keep their
drinking water clean.  That makes no sense to me.  Clean water is
the single most important environmental issue in every community.

We want states and localities to play a greater role in keeping
water clean.  Republicans should be arguing for moving
responsibility to states, not making it more difficult for them.

<P><STRONG>Buchanan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Dole</STRONG>:  For fiscal year 1996, EPA will
<EM>not</EM> receive a 35% cut in funding.  Although Bob Dole
supports the current funding level for EPA, EPA must also bear
its
share of the burden of achieving a balanced budget.  EPA has
almost
doubled in size in the past 20 years to over 19,000 employees
(not
counting contract employees), and its budget has grown from $1.6
<EM>billion</EM> to $3.6 billion (in constant dollars), not
counting construction spending, during the same period.  More EPA
staff does not automatically mean a better environment.  It does
mean fewer resources to devote to other needs (e.g., health,
nutrition, housing).

<P><STRONG>Dornan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Forbes</STRONG>:  I have established no specific
funding
level.

<P><STRONG>Gramm</STRONG>:  To balance the federal budget, cut
taxes, and defend private property in America, I will look at
every
federal program - including the EPA - to determine if the
benefits
to be derived by spending money on it are worth taking the money
away from hard-working, ordinary Americans to pay for it.  Not a
lot of programs will stand up to that test.

<P><STRONG>Keyes</STRONG>:  Yes (noting the cuts were 20% less
than
the President's budget).  Appropriations riders were the only way
to discipline EPA after the environmental establishment blocked
reauthorization of major environmental bills.

<P><STRONG>Lugar</STRONG>:  No.  I would oppose a 35% cut in
current funding levels, but I voted for a smaller cut in FY'95
[sic] funding levels for EPA.

<P><STRONG>Taylor</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>
16.) Do you support repeal of the 1935 Public Utility Holding
Company Act?</STRONG> 

<P><STRONG>Clinton</STRONG>:  No. PUHCA was enacted to limit
anti-
competitive behavior by utility monopolies, and still serves as
an
important safeguard for consumers.  Significant changes have been
enacted to PUHCA and related laws in recent years, and we should
carefully examine the effect of those reforms before we make
further changes.  However, as the electric utility industry
becomes
more competitive, the Administration will assess the prospects
for
undertaking statutory reforms of PUHCA in view of national
objectives of reliable, clean, and economic electricity
generation.

<P><STRONG>Alexander</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Buchanan</STRONG>:  No Response.

<P><STRONG>Dole</STRONG>:  Yes.  The 1935 Public Utility Holding
Company Act is an outdated statute that no longer provides
benefits
to consumers or investors and should be repealed.  The Securities
and Exchange Commission under both Republican and Democratic
Administrations in 1981 and again in 1985 has recommended repeal
of
this statute.  Bob Dole has co-sponsored legislation that would
repeal this out-moded statute with appropriate safeguards for
consumers.

<P><STRONG>Dornan</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Forbes</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Gramm</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Keyes</STRONG>:  Yes.

<P><STRONG>Lugar</STRONG>:  Yes, if this would eliminate
duplicative regulation.

<P><STRONG>Taylor</STRONG>:  Yes.

<h1><center>Corporate Welfare</h1></center>
<p>
Each year, U.S. taxpayers subsidize U.S. businesses to the tune 
of more than $150 billion. Every five years, the U.S. Treasury loses $1 
billion because mining companies don't pay a fair market value for 
minerals extracted from public lands. Companies such as Hershey 
International and McDonalds receive some $69 million each year in public 
funds for advertising campaigns and other promotions of their products as 
American agricultural exports.  Stopping public funding of new roads in 
the national forests, which are used by timber companies to carry away 
trees they bought from the government for next to nothing, would save 
about $50 million annually.  
<p>
	Each dollar spent on these "aid for dependent corporation" 
welfare programs means one dollar less for environmental programs, 
support for education, assistance to those in need, tax 
breaks for families, or deficit reduction.  During this Congress, Public 
Citizen will help lead a major  push to reduce corporate welfare. Key 
votes will likely occur in the spring, when the 
budget is debated, and then in the summer and fall as specific 
appropriations bills, ladened with corporate pork, are considered.

Finance Reform <img 
height=20 width=50 src="/congress/images/dollar.gif"></h3></center><p>

	The current campaign finance system is a scandal.  Monied 
interests control the legislative agenda of the Congress because they 
control the purse strings of the campaigns.  Only the rich, or the 
friends of the rich, can afford to run for office.  Incumbents accumulate 
massive war chests to scare off potential challengers merely be holding 
out their hands at fundraisers attended by PACs and lobbyists.  The 
public is outraged by this system and frustrated with Congress's failure 
to change it.  
<p>
	Parties and candidates spent nearly $2 billion on the 1996 
elections, the most ever.   Outside groups spent hundreds of millions 
more on independent expenditures and so-called issue advocacy.  Tales of 
fundraising scandals and abuses were daily occurrences during the last 
few months of the campaign, and investigations and recriminations will 
likely occupy the Congress for months to come.  And for what?  The end 
result of this spending orgy was an election in which less than half of 
the eligible electorate turned out to vote, and 95% of incumbent members 
of the House (and all but one Senator) who sought reelection were 
successful.  
<p>
	Public Citizen has long been committed to bringing about 
meaningful campaign finance reform, and we will play a leading role in 
pushing for a major overhaul in the 105th Congress.  Such reform should 
include a cap on spending in exchange for significant public resources, a 
ban on soft money, and reductions in the influence of special interest 
PACs.  Unlimited party spending and electioneering disguised as issue 
advocacy also must be addressed.  Congress must also improve disclosure 
of campaign funding and enforcement of the election laws, which includes 
providing adequate resources for the FEC to do its job.

	Today, Americans enjoy safer automobiles and consumer products, 
purer food and drinking water, cleaner air, more reliable drugs and 
medical devices, and safer work places than ever before.  These

similar assault on these important protections in the 105th 
Congress.

	Pro-industry Members of Congress want to cripple government 
agencies such as the EPA, the FDA, and OSHA --  each charged with 
protecting the health and safety of the American public.  Anti-regulatory 
extremists have a three-pronged approach to rolling back important health 
and safety standards: 1) Paralyze regulatory agencies by requiring 
needless and excessively bureaucratic procedures -- such as extensive 
cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments -- before a simple standard to 
implement environmental, health and safety laws could be issued.  2) 
Attack actual laws that guarantee health and safety protections.  At 
various times over the last two years, serious attempts to roll back the 
Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the 
Food, Drugs and Cosmetics Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act 
all came up for consideration.  3) De-fund important agencies and 
programs that ensure health and safety.
<p>
	Anti-safety leaders and their special interest allies were 
thwarted in the 104th Congress, but they are likely to be back with a 
vengeance in 1997-1998.  One probable bill will neutralize important FDA 
protections.  Another may make a broader attack on all environmental, 
health and safety laws.  Public Citizen is prepared to again take the 
lead to make sure that critical health and safety standards are not 
rolled back.

<h1><center>Civil Justice/Legal Rights</h1></center>
<p>
	For over 100 years, Americans injured by defective products, 
unsafe workplaces and medical malpractice have had the right to seek 
compensation in courts of law before citizen juries. America's civil 
justice system has been responsible for punishing corporations that  
manufacture defective products -- such as the Ford Pinto, school buses, 
asbestos, tobacco and the Dalkon Shield -- and holding HMOs, hospitals 
and doctors accountable for reckless medical care.  Public Citizen 
believes that Americans have a right to a trial by jury when they are 
injured by defective products or negligent health care. 
<p>
	Because it has been a successful deterrent of corporate 
misconduct, in the last 15 years, America's civil justice system has been 
under ferocious attack in Congress and state legislatures by HMOs and 
doctors, insurance companies, oil and chemical polluters, big tobacco and 
auto manufacturers seeking immunity for wrongdoing. Although corporations 
have been successful in securing some limitations on liability in 
individual states, Public Citizen and other consumer groups have stopped 
Congress from enacting federal limits on corporate liability.
<p>	But each year, the attack on the right to trial by jury 
intensifies. Last year, the bill actually passed Congress but was stopped 
from becoming law by President Clinton's veto. In 1997, Public Citizen 
will once again lead the effort to oppose another well-funded corporate 
effort to limit the liability of reckless corporations and doctors. Votes 
will likely take place in the House 
and Senate during the Spring of 1997.  In addition to limitations on 
liability for defective products and medical malpractice, key votes will 
likely occur on limiting the liability of railroads and shipping 
companies.

<center><h1>Health Care Reform</h1></center><p>

	One hundred forty-million Americans now get their health coverage 
through some form of managed care. There has been an explosion of big 
business, profit-making managed care companies that often put profits 
ahead of patient care. Some managed care companies have included "gag 
rules" in their contracts with participating physicians, preventing them 
from fully discussing treatment options with patients.  Many have 
financial incentives which reward doctors for referring fewer patients to 
specialists.  Often decisions on what treatments will be authorized are 
made by persons who have not examined the patients -- they may not even 
be fully qualified medical professionals.  
<p>
	Only a few states have adopted comprehensive measures to stop 
managed care abuses.  Many Americans whose health care comes from 
self-insured, employer-sponsored managed care plans are not protected by 
any state legislation because current federal law forbids states from 
regulating such plans.	
<p>									  
	Public Citizen continues to believe that fundamental health care 
reform that provides quality universal care will only come when the U.S. 
adopts a single-payer system similar to Canada's.  However, to protect 
those Americans who find themselves in managed care from abuses which may 
threaten their health, Public Citizen is working for passage of federal 
legislation to provide comprehensive, effective regulation of managed 
care and for a change in federal law to ensure that states are able to 
protect the rights of all managed care enrollees within their state.

<p><I>1995 Annual Report</h1></I> </center>
<p>
<b>1995</b> was a year of great accomplishment for Public Citizen
Litigation Group.  In terms of productivity, 1995 was exceptional.
The sheer number of cases in which the Litigation Group is involved
has grown significantly, largely as a result of our legal staff's
high level of experience.  Indeed, Litigation Group lawyers average
about 15 years in practice, and nearly ten years with the group,
which enables us to handle a high volume of complex cases. <p>

<p>

     1995 was a watershed as well in terms of significant
victories.  Not only did we win an important victory in the Supreme
Court, but we  also saw notable wins on a number of  key fronts,
including class action litigation, industry claims that consumer
rights are cut off or "preempted" by a federal law, and open
government.<p>

<p>

     The Litigation Group was founded in 1972 by Ralph Nader and
Alan Morrison, the Group's senior lawyer and formerly its director.

For the past three years, David Vladeck has directed the Group,
which has a staff of ten lawyers, including one who serves as the
Coordinator for the Supreme Court Assistance Project, which is
discussed in the final section of this report.  <p>

<p>

     In 1995, Litigation Group staff handled cases in virtually
every federal circuit, in a number  of state courts, and  before
severalfederal agencies.  Unlike some other public interest law
firms, we rarely file briefs as an <i>amicus curiae</i> (friend of
the court) in cases primarily handled by other lawyers.  Thus, the
cases discussed in this Report, unless otherwise noted, were
handled by Litigation Group staff lawyers.  In addition, staff
lawyers were actively involved in the legislative process, often
testifying before congressional committees, working with committee
staffs, writing reports on pending legislation, and providing
technical support to Public Citizen's lobbying arm, Congress Watch.

<p>

<p>

     Consistent with the Litigation Group's long track record of
appearances before the United States Supreme Court, our attorneys
argued yet another case before the Court in 1995, bringing the
total number of cases we have argued to 36.  In that case,
<i>Yamaha v. Calhoun</i>, we represented the family of a 12-year
old girl killed while using an allegedly defective jet ski. 
Yamaha, the jet ski's manufacturer, claimed that "general federal
maritime law,"  and not state law, determined how much a victim's
survivors can recover in accidents occurring in the territorial
waters of the United States. That claim, if accepted, would have
limited the family's recovery to funeral expenses and little more. 
Fortunately, in an unanimous ruling that came right after the new
year, the Court agreed with our position and held that state law
governs.  Our victory in <i>Yamaha</i> brings our record to 24
wins, 11 losses and one tie.  Moreover, we have two cases pending
before the Court that will be heard in 1996, which is a testament
to the vitality of our Supreme Court practice.<p>

<p>

     From its founding in 1972, the Litigation Group has focused
its efforts to protect consumers in five major areas: government
and corporate accountability; fighting government and corporate
secrecy; regulation of the professions; separation of powers; and
worker rights.  In recent years, however, our efforts to protect
consumers have expanded dramatically to respond to two disturbing
trends in the law.<p>

<p>

     First is the rising tide of class action settlements that
benefit the manufacturers of unsafe or defective products and the
plaintiffs' lawyers, but deliver little or no value to consumers. 
The class action device can be a powerful pro-consumer tool because
it allows a large number of individuals who have been ripped off to
join forces against large corporations or the government.  But too
often in recent years that tool has been used to fashion sweetheart
settlements for lawyers and defendants that work against the
interests of consumers.  <p>

<p>

     Second, we are also doing battle against the aggressive use by
corporate defendants of the "preemption defense" - a claim that a
federal  law or regulation ousts (preempts) state laws  that allow
the consumer or accident victim to recover damages.  In 1995, we
handled cases involving medical devices, airline safety, automobile
safety, and maritime accidents.  And next year we will argue an
important preemption case involving medical devices before the
Supreme Court.<p>

<p>

     Because our work on class actions and preemption now occupies
center stage at the Litigation Group, we begin this year's annual
report with an overview of the significant cases we have handled in
those fields.  We then summarize our more important cases in each
of the other areas as well, to show the breadth of our work and the
impact we have had, and will continue to have, in those critical
areas.<p>

related jobs and wages, environmental and health conditions and illegal drug flow. <p>

If NAFTA can not pass such a "do no further harm" test in these area, then the President must conduct
renegotiations to fix specific problems. If the problems are not fixed, the bill provides for termination of
Congressional authorization of NAFTA.  Unless NAFTA were reauthorized by Congress, this would
trigger U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA.<p>

Currently, 108  Members of the House of Representatives have cosponsored the 
NAFTA Accountability
Act-- 66 Democrats, 40 Republicans and 2 independents. A number of these 
cosponsors had even voted for NAFTA. <p>

Since this bill is opposed by President Clinton and the Republican leadership, this legislation will likely
need to gather more than 200 cosponsors in order to get a vote.

ACTION ALERT

URGE PRESIDENT CLINTON TO STAND FIRM AGAINST GIVING LAND TO
CALIFORNIA FOR DANGEROUS WARD VALLEY RADIOACTIVE WASTE DUMP

BACKGROUND: 

	-The State of California is seeking the transfer of about 1,000 acres 
of land from the federal Bureau of Land Management for use as a 
"low-level" radioactive waste dump to be built and run by U.S. Ecology, a 
company whose previous dumps have leaked badly.

	-Committee to Bridge the Gap, a public interest group based in 
California that has led the opposition to the dump, projects that the 
following radioactive wastes would go to Ward Valley over its assumed 
30-year life (in curies):

       Nuclear Reactor Wastes

       Routine Releases                     141,009
       Irradiated Components                557,882
       Primary Coolant Decontamination      303,875
       Power Plant Decommissioning          375,907
       Reactor Design Firms                  15,207

       Total Nuclear Reactor Wastes       1,393,880      

These reactor wastes would constitute 97.59% of all radioactive wastes, 
in curies, to go to Ward Valley. The remaining 2.41% would come from 
industrial users, biotech companies, medical and academic institutions, 
and government entities. Despite the overwhelming predominance of the 
nuclear utility wastes, the dump proponents have tried to make this a
fight over hospital and biotechnology wastes. Despite the misleading tag 
of "low-level," much of this waste is highly toxic and will remain 
hazardous for centuries.

	-Data that was recently pried out of the U.S. Dept. of the Interior 
shows alarmingly high levels of tritium and carbon-14 near Nevada's 
Beatty dump for "low-level" radioactive waste.  Beatty, now closed, is 
operated by U.S. Ecology, the same contractor chosen for Ward Valley, and 
has been considered a model for Ward Valley. What the Beatty studies 
show is that radioactive waste migrates through the desert much more 
rapidly than previously thought, which means radiation from Ward 
Valley could leach into the water table and the Colorado River, source of 
drinking water for millions.

	-The land slated for the dump is sacred to several Native American 
tribes.

	-The land is also prime critical habitat for the desert tortoise, a 
threatened species.

	-The San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors voted 5-0 on November 
21 to ban disposal of radioactive waste above a "significant water 
resource," and to require waste to be disposed of in lead-lined 
waterproof vaults of steel-reinforced concrete.  Ward Valley is in the
county of San Bernardino and is above a significant water resource. U.S. 
Ecology does not plan vaults or liners of any sort; instead, waste would 
be dumped into unlined shallow trenches. The state and U.S. Ecology say 
the county has no authority to regulate radioactive waste dumps, and that 
issue will probably be decided in court. 

	-The Dept. of Interior has been negotiating with California Gov. Pete 
Wilson over the terms of the transfer of the federal land to the state 
for use as a dump. Interior has already reneged on a promise to hold a 
public hearing before any land transfer, so there is a danger of an
administration cave-in.

	-Congress, as part of its massive budget reconciliation bill, snuck in 
(with no public hearing or notice) a provision mandating the land 
transfer to California with no conditions and exempting the transfer from 
environmental laws. President Clinton vetoed the bill for 82 reasons, 
Ward Valley being one of them. The Clinton administration is now 
negotiating with Congress over the budget bill, so grass-roots support is 
key to convincing the president not to yield on this issue.
 
WHAT YOU CAN DO:

       	Email President Clinton, president@whitehouse.gov or 
75300.3115@compuserve.com, and Vice-President Gore, 
vice.president@whitehouse.gov. You can also fax Clinton at 202-456-2461, 
and Gore at 202-973-1475.

       	Californians should also fax letters to John Emerson, a deputy 
assistant for intergovernmental affairs who will be running the 
Clinton-Gore re-election campaign in California. His fax is 202-456-6220 
or 456-2889, and his phone numbers are 202-456-2896 and 456-7060. 

       	Thank the president for vetoing the budget reconciliation bill, 
and for listing the Ward Valley land transfer as one of his 82 reasons to 
veto. Urge him to continue to stand firm against signing any bill 
mandating a Ward Valley land transfer, and to refuse to administratively 
transfer the land to the State of California as long as major environmental,
health and safety questions remain unresolved.

       	For further information, contact Bill Magavern at Public Citizen,
202-546-4996 (on vacation until Jan. 2) or Joe Lyou at Committee to Bridge
the Gap, 310-478-0829.

<H3>
KEEP NUCLEAR WASTE OFF THE ROAD;  OPPOSE H.R. 1020
</H3><P>
     Is nuclear waste coming to your community?  If the nuclear
industry gets its way, citizens in 43 states could host thousands
of tons of high-level nuclear waste on a journey to Nevada.
<P>     Since 1987, Yucca Mountain in Nevada has been targeted as
the final home for the nation's irradiated nuclear fuel.  The
Department of Energy's program to study the site has been beset
by poor management and cost overruns and continues in the face of
vigorous state opposition and mounting evidence that the site may
be unsuitable. A nuclear waste repository, once expected by 1998
will not be available until 2010, at the earliest.
<P>     Nuclear utilities have generated approximately 30,000 metric
tons of high-level nuclear waste.  Having produced so much of
some of the deadliest materials ever created, they are now
appealing to the government to take out their garbage for them.
<P>     The House of Representatives will soon consider legislation to
do just that.  The industry-backed 
Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1995, H.R. 1020, would force the construction
of an unneeded and unwanted "interim" storage facility in Nevada,
overriding current law that forbids placing such a facility in
Nevada.   This prohibition is important to ensuring the integrity
of site suitability studies at Yucca Mountain lest any
"temporary" site become a de facto permanent repository.  The
interim site would not, however, have the performance
expectations of a repository.
<P>     There is no substantive rationale for moving high-level
nuclear waste to a centralized interim site.  No risk assessment
or cost-benefit analysis has been conducted that justifies the
hazards and expense of such a project.  While the nuclear
industry claims that centralized storage reduces high-level waste
sites from 109 to one, every operating reactor will remain a
high-level waste site so long as it continues to split atoms. 
Nuclear utilities want to move the waste out of their backyards
purely for political and public relations reasons. 
<P>
H.R. 1020 would also:    
<P>               
-eliminate repository site suitability standards<BR> 
-establish a repository radiation exposure standard that poses a
lifetime risk of one cancer death for every 285 exposed individuals<BR> 
-carve holes in the National Environmental Policy Act<BR>
-forbid the Environmental Protection Agency from issuing<BR>
radiation release standards<BR>
-allow the preemption of Nevada state law<BR>
-establish unforgiving deadlines that may compromise program
safety<BR>
-order the DOE to begin interim storage construction without
Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval<P>

     If H.R. 1020 passes, transportation of high-level
radioactive waste will commence on a scale unprecedented in human
history.  Over 95 percent of the nation's waste radioactivity is
contained within these materials.  The increased number of
shipments, coupled with the length of the journey (most reactors
are east of the Mississippi River) will raise the likelihood of
transportation accidents involving radioactive waste.  Cask
safety standards fail to incorporate the full range of trauma to
which a cask may be exposed in an accident, and regulations do
not require testing of full-scale models to ensure compliance.  
<P>
What you can do:
<P>
Write or call Representative and urge her or him to:
<P>   
     -oppose H.R. 1020 and any other bill that would weaken
environmental standards or force construction of an unneeded
"interim" storage facility

<BR>
<P>
<H3>I. <U>Identification of Commentors and Their Interest in this
Matter</U>.<H3>
<P>
<H4>
IPALCO Enterprises, Inc. (&quot;IPALCO&quot;), the Citizens Action
Coalition of Indiana, Inc. (&quot;CAC&quot;) and Public Citizen,
Inc. (&quot;Public Citizen&quot;), jointly submit these comments
on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (&quot;NRC&quot; or 
&quot;Commission&quot;)
proposed policy statement regarding the impact of competition
and electric utility industry restructuring on its power reactor
licensees.
<P>
IPALCO is a multi-state energy company providing a variety of
energy products and services. IPALCO's principal subsidiary, Indianapolis
Power &amp; Light Company, provides retail and wholesale electric,
steam and other energy services primarily in the area in and around
Indianapolis, Indiana. CAC is an Indiana not-for-profit corporation
which represents the interest of consumers in utility matters
and is also actively involved in environmental protection issues
in Indiana and throughout the United States. Public Citizen is
a non-profit research, lobbying and litigation organization based
in Washington, D.C., which advocates for consumer protection and
for government and corporate accountability, and is supported
by members throughout the United States. None of the commentors
herein are power reactor licensees or have any proprietary interest
in power reactor licensees of the NRC.
<P>
IPALCO, CAC and Public Citizen have been actively involved in
the ongoing national debate and proceedings with reference to
electric utility industry restructuring
<A HREF="#footnote1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>. They support national
efforts to bring full, fair and sustainable competition to the
electric utility industry in a manner which will be beneficial
to all energy consumers while protecting and promoting public
health, safety and the environment. <BR>
<P></H4>
<H3>II. <U>Summary Position of Commentors</U>.</H3>
<P><H4>
The Commission's Draft Policy Statement (&quot;DPS&quot;) is a
necessary and timely effort. The Commission is commended for its
willingness to confront the serious and potentially dramatic effects
on its licensees of the transition to a more competitive electric
utility industry. The Commission's concerns as expressed in the
DPS are legitimate, and prompt regulatory action will be required
to ensure adequate protection of the public health, safety and
environment.
<P>
The NRC should acknowledge certain principles and consider specific
proposals. First, the current &quot;fund as you go&quot; exemption
for regulated public utility licensees' decommissioning funding
is untenable. In a restructured and competitive industry, adequate
funding should be assured in advance. Second, the Commission should
immediately require, by rule or order, that all funds received
by any licensee for so-called &quot;stranded cost&quot; recoveries
are first applied to fully fund that licensee's external decommissioning
trust fund. Third, licensee decommissioning funds collected to
date that remain in so-called &quot;internal funds&quot; of the
licensee-utility should be immediately converted into independent,
external trust funds. Fourth, incremental decommissioning cost
estimates should be required to be fully analyzed and revised
as appropriate, particularly in the context of revising procedures
to facilitate early retirement of uneconomic licensee reactors.
Finally, the NRC should request of Congress additional inspection
and compliance resources for the daunting tasks associated with
regulating its licensees in an increasingly competitive industry.
<P>
As good policy, the Commission's actions should not be directed
toward frustrating the electric industry's movement toward competition,
nor should the Commission allow its regulatory regime to promote
special protections, subsidies or other competitive advantages
to its licensees which are injurious to competition, consumers
and competitors. The Commission will increasingly become involved
in the ongoing national debate on restructuring. In this debate,
the Commission must take a principled policy position. Licensees
with questionable financial ability to sustain safe operations
in a competitive environment should be promptly shut-down and
decommissioning completed. They should not be propped-up by direct
or indirect subsidies.
<P></H4>
<H3>III. <U>The Economics of Restructuring and Nuclear Power</U>.</H3>
<P><H4>
Much discussion has already occurred concerning the effects industry
restructuring may have on the segment of the electric utility
business owning nuclear generating stations. The percentage of
generation in the United States provided from nuclear power has
oscillated between 21% and 22% since 1990. While nuclear power
thus represents a substantial source of electrical energy today,
a significant percentage of existing nuclear power plants could
be replaced by much lower cost alternatives in a relatively short
period of time. Indeed, recent proceedings by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (&quot;FERC&quot;) which address the so-called
&quot;stranded cost&quot; problem emphasize this economic reality
<A HREF=#footnote2><SUP>2</SUP></A>.
<P>
The extent to which existing investment in nuclear power plants
exceeds the current cost to replace their output using modern
technology is substantial. Such potentially stranded costs represent
the lion's share of the total electric utility industry stranded
costs estimated to range from $50 to $300 billion <A HREF=#footnote3>
<SUP>3</SUP></A>. Even Commission
licensees assert that &quot;the financial integrity of some utilities
may be jeopardized&quot; <A HREF=#footnote4><SUP>4</SUP></A>
 by the failure to fully recover stranded
costs.
<P>
Regardless of the uncertainty created by stranded sunk capital
costs, many licensees will be required to compete on the basis
of forward operating costs <A HREF=#footnote5><SUP>5</SUP></A>
 in a competitive environment. Despite
recent relative improvements in some licensees' operating costs,
many licensees may not be competitively viable on this basis alone.
For example, if 2.4&#162; per kWh proves to be the competitive
benchmark for production costs, <A HREF=#footnote6><SUP>6</SUP></A>
 then 34 of 109 utility-owned commercial
power reactors would not be economically viable based on their
production costs during 1993 through 1995. <A HREF=#footnote7>
<SUP>7</SUP></A> By comparison, if the
competitive benchmark is only 2.0&#162; per kWh, then 55 reactors,
or approximately one-half of the total, would not be economically
viable given their reported production costs between 1993 and
1995. Perhaps most notable of all, 30 of the 55 reactors that
fail the test for financial viability at 2&#162; per kWh had capacity
factors greater than 70% during the relevant period. <A HREF=#footnote8>
<SUP>8</SUP></A> Even the
most zealous advocates of nuclear power appear to concede that
many licensees will be competitively viable power sellers only
if full stranded cost recovery and substantial license extensions
occur. <A HREF=#footnote9><SUP>9</SUP></A>
<P>
A recent Moody's report places 47 of 65 nuclear utilities evaluated
into the &quot;significant risk&quot; category and states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Many nuclear operating utilities are among the group least likely
to avoid a deterioration in credit quality as competition unfolds.
Notwithstanding the progress that many of these utilities have
made in lowering non-fuel operating and maintenance expense, interest,
and property taxes, the cash costs tied to nuclear power production
remain high and may not be recoverable in the rates dictated by
an open market. . . .[O]n average, non-fuel operating and maintenance
costs (fixed charges) associated with the generation of nuclear
power (expressed in dollars per kilowatt) are greater than those
relating to fossil fueled or hydro power by wide multiples. Likewise,
. . . sunk costs, which are non-cash in nature and relate to recovery
of past capital expenditures, are substantially greater on a dollar
per kilowatt basis for nuclear plants than for other types, reflecting
the high initial costs of constructing nuclear capacity.
<A HREF=#footnote10><SUP>10</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Since April 1993, Moody's has downgraded the bond ratings of 24
nuclear utilities, some more than once. <A HREF=#footnote11><SUP>11</SUP></A>
<P>
As the industry is restructured, the continued viability of many
nuclear plants becomes increasingly questionable. Under the existing
monopoly system, captive customers subsidize the high capital
costs or high operating costs, or both, of such plants through
electricity prices that far exceed the current long-run marginal
cost of producing power. Some proposals to restructure the electric
utility industry, including Order 888, explicitly acknowledge
and seek to preserve these subsidies in the name of &quot;stranded
cost&quot; protection. Other proposals do not.
<P>
If national retail competition occurs without stranded cost subsidies,
one group of existing nuclear power plants, those with low sunk
capital costs, low operating costs and limited incremental capital
requirements, will either be largely unaffected or increasingly
profitable. A second group of nuclear power plants, those with
low operating costs, but high sunk capital costs, will continue
operating, albeit with an accounting write-down of the value of
such plants and less financial assurance of the ability to perform
necessary tasks affecting the public health, safety and environment
like decommissioning.
<P>
A third group of nuclear power plants will, of necessity, cease
operations. This group includes those plants with operating costs
that will exceed the market price of power for a sustained period
of time and plants which, despite low operating costs, confront
the need for major, incremental capital expenditures for projects
like re-sleeving cracked steam tubes and replacing steam generators.
In this regard, Moody's reported:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the August 1995 Special Comment <I>Stranded Costs Will 
Threaten
Credit Quality of U.S. Electrics</I>, Moody's first reported the
belief that there are at least 10 nuclear plants (out of 110 in
the U.S.) that might be closed for economic reasons if the generation
of electric power is completely deregulated. The propensity for
certain nuclear plants to require expensive capital additions
to comply with the standards of their Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) operating license increases the likelihood that the number
of early shutdowns might be even greater than those 10 originally
identified. <A HREF=#footnote12><SUP>12</SUP></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
As these plants cease operation, they cease producing spent fuel
and other waste streams that require storage, transportation and
disposal. Once these non-viable plants cease operation, a national
plan for the prompt decommissioning of these plants must be confronted.
<P></H4>
<H3>IV. <U>Specific Issues to be Addressed and Regulatory Action 
Required</U>.</H3>
<P><H4>
The plain fact that many licensees' investments in nuclear power
plants are uneconomic and sunk costs will not be recoverable in
a competitive environment has numerous implications. Many of the
most immediate and significant issues concern the inevitable 
&quot;back-end&quot;
costs of the nuclear cycle associated with decommissioning and
waste disposal. Indeed, numerous licensees argued at the FERC
that proposed stranded cost recovery provisions were <I>inadequate</I>
to assure decommission funding. <A HREF=#footnote13><SUP>13</SUP></A>
 Notably, none of the utility proposals
presented, which continue the huge cash flows that both the current
monopoly system and stranded cost protection produce for these
plants, suggest that stranded cost &quot;lost revenues&quot; that
are recovered through these regulatory schemes should be <I>dedicated</I>
to the necessary tasks of decommissioning and waste disposal.
Other issues which need to be addressed relate primarily to assuring
adequate resources are available to the Commission during a period
of necessary increased activity.
<P>
Certain specific proposals should be considered by the Commission.
First, as the DPS acknowledges, since monopoly protection will
no longer assure licensees of recovering all costs or maintaining
financial viability, the current requirements for financial assurance
by a licensee, particularly with reference to funding decommissioning,
require revision. The current &quot;fund as you go&quot; exemption
for regulated public utility licensees' decommissioning funding
is untenable because monopoly protection is neither desirable
nor likely to continue until all licenses expire and plants are
decommissioned.
<P>
The Commission's decommissioning requirements are designed to
ensure protection of the public health, safety and environment
by (1) requiring licensees to maintain adequate funds to safely
remove their plants from service and decontaminate and decommission
the radiological portions of their facilities, and (2) ensuring
that residual radioactivity at the site resulting from a plant's
operation meets stringent radiological criteria. Specifically,
10 C.F.R. &#167;50.33 requires holders of operating licenses to
provide reasonable assurance that they have sufficient funds available
to decommission their plants. In addition, 10 C.F.R. &#167;50.75
requires the submission of a decommissioning report containing
a certification that a specified level of funding will be provided.
<P>
Citing pro-nuclear industry sources, the average per unit decommissioning
cost estimate (in 1994 dollars) is in the range of $300-$400 million.
<A HREF=#footnote14><SUP>14</SUP></A>
For the nuclear power plants, this yields a future liability on
the order of $35 to $40 billion, across the industry. Because
funding for this future liability is currently accumulated over
the life of the generating plants, the amount that has been collected
to date by the industry is only approximately $6 billion. 
<A HREF=#footnote15><SUP>15</SUP></A> Clearly,
in a restructured and competitive industry, adequate funding must
be assured in advance. There is no continued justification for
the &quot;fund as you go&quot; approach.
<P>
Second, prompted by Order 888 and competitive pressures, many
licensees are now seeking from utility regulators the ability
to recover their stranded sunk capital costs during the transition
to full competition. Such stranded cost recovery schemes go by
various names, including &quot;transition costs,&quot; &quot;wires
charges&quot; and &quot;exit fees.&quot; The use of cash flows
received by licensees from such stranded cost recovery schemes
is currently unrestrained. In essence, a licensee can get the
money and leave town with it, or more appropriately leave the
country, primarily by investing in foreign ventures. During the
last two years at least five nuclear electric utilities that have
been identified as having significant &quot;stranded costs,&quot;
have participated in overseas merger or acquisition transactions
involving approximately $7.5 billion. <A HREF=#footnote16><SUP>16
</SUP></A> The Commission should immediately
require of all licensees that all funds received by any licensee
from such stranded cost recovery first be applied to fully fund
the licensee's external decommissioning trust fund.
<P>
Third, a significant fraction of some licensee decommissioning
funds collected to date remain in so-called &quot;internal funds&quot;
of the licensee-utility. <A HREF=#footnote17><SUP>17</SUP></A>
The future availability of actual funds
for decommissioning from such internal funds is inherently dependent
on the continued financial viability of the licensee in an increasingly
uncertain competitive environment. In requiring full prefunding,
the Commission should also require all such internal funds be
immediately converted to independent, external trust funds.
<P>
Fourth, decommissioning cost estimates may require revision in
numerous respects. For example, the cost estimates used to establish
the level of funding needed should not assume any ongoing administrative
and general support from the licensees. To assure adequate decommissioning
funding regardless of the then-financial status of a competitive
licensee, the amount of decommissioning costs to be prefunded
in the external trust should be the cost of an independent third
party to perform all necessary decommissioning tasks, including
administrative and general support.
<P>
Similarly, because of the increased likelihood of early licensee
retirement of nuclear power plants in a competitive environment,
and to assure that the lack of cost-effective and fair procedures
for early retirement do not frustrate or delay otherwise economically
rational decisions to retire a plant, the Commission should promptly
review its procedural and substantive requirements for early licensee
termination and decommissioning. Among the many considerations
in this regard would be investigation and data gathering on a
decommissioning cost estimate credit associated with a voluntary
commitment to early retirement. Such a &quot;credit,&quot; or
reduction in the decommissioning prefunding requirement, should
be equal to the estimated incremental decommissioning costs that
will be avoided by a commitment to early retirement.
<A HREF=#footnote18><SUP>18</SUP></A>
<P>
It is important to recognize that some decommissioning costs are
&quot;fixed,&quot; in the sense that an obligation to incur them
at a future date is determined by an initial decision to operate
the plant. Generally, the total radioactivity inventory of a nuclear
power plant builds up very quickly during the first few years
of operation, and then tends to level off.
<P>
On the other hand, there will be some incremental costs associated
with any changes in scope of decommissioning activities, caused
by continued operation, even after the first few years. 
<A HREF=#footnote19><SUP>19</SUP></A> For example,
the total radioactivity is dominated by that built up in the reactor
vessel and internals, and that is dominated by Cobalt 60, which
has a relatively short half-life (5 years). <A HREF=#footnote20>
<SUP>20</SUP></A> The more problematic
isotopes may be those such as Nickel 59 (half-life of 80,000 years)
and Niobium 94 (half-life of 20,000 years). <A HREF=#footnote21><SUP>
21</SUP></A> These levels of radioactivity
build up linearly with plant operation. In reality, whenever deferred
dismantlement is a likely scenario, the longer-life isotopes will
play a more prominent role in the overall inventory at the time
of dismantlement. Also, if continued operation results in unexpected
contamination of certain components and structures, the additional
tasks associated with packaging and burial will increase decommissioning
costs.
<P>
Another area in which decommissioning costs may be incrementally
increased by plant operation relates to equipment additions and
replacement. As previously discussed, the costs of such incremental
capital additions to nuclear plants have been considerable. The
cost of decommissioning the added equipment has generally been
ignored. In one case, the cost for decommissioning just three
years of added equipment at one plant was estimated at about $10
million in 1985 dollars. <A HREF=#footnote22><SUP>22</SUP></A>
 Over a full plant operating license period,
the amount of equipment added and replaced can be considerable.
Steam generator replacement, for example, can add considerably
to decommissioning costs. In sum, the issue of incremental decommissioning
costs must be fully analyzed.
<P>
Finally, the NRC should be aware that the pressures of a competitive
environment on uneconomic licensees could motivate underfunding
necessary operating requirements, deferring maintenance, reducing
staffing below acceptable levels, <A HREF=#footnote23><SUP>23</SUP>
</A>  or engaging in corporate reorganization
or mergers to &quot;isolate&quot; nuclear costs. <A HREF=#footnote24>
<SUP>24</SUP></A> Given the unique
public health, safety and environmental effects of the licensees'
operations, the NRC should evaluate its own internal needs for
additional inspection and compliance resources, and seek additional
resources needed for the daunting tasks ahead.
<P></H4>
<H3>V. <U>Avoiding Anti-Competitive Effects in Licensee Regulation</U>.</H3>
<P><H4>
A broad concern involves Commission policy regarding the inherent
unsustainability of continued subsidization of its licensees during
industry restructuring. The commercial nuclear power industry
in the U.S. is one of the most heavily subsidized industrial segments
in the world. <A HREF=#footnote25><SUP>25</SUP></A>
 Whether it is long-standing legislative subsidies
like the Price-Anderson Act of 1957 or the new regulatory 
&quot;super-subsidies,&quot;
such as stranded cost surcharges and transition exit fees, the
advent of full, fair and sustainable competition will of necessity
require stripping away all of these subsidies. As Commission licensees
attempt to &quot;have thebest of both worlds&quot; -- the massive
subsidies of the current monopoly system and the anti-competitive
advantages those same subsidies would confer in an unregulated
marketplace -- the Commission will increasingly become involved
in the ongoing national debate on restructuring. Already some
licensees are urging economic regulators and policymakers to provide
continuing subsidies because &quot;the nuclear industry developed
as it did, in large part, as a result of government policies and
regulation.&quot; <A HREF=#footnote26><SUP>26</SUP></A>
 In this debate, the Commission must take a principled
policy position. Licensees with questionable financial ability
to sustain safe operations in a competitive environment should
be promptly shut-down and decommissioning completed. They should
not be propped-up by direct or indirect subsidies. To the extent
the DPS suggests otherwise in Section IV (A), it should be revised.
<P>
The Commission's actions should not be directed toward frustrating
the electric industries' movement toward competition, nor should
the Commission allow its regulatory regime to promote special
protections, subsidies or other competitive advantages to its
licensees which are injurious to competition, consumers and competitors.
The Commission should assure, to the maximum extent practicable,
that all costs associated with the operation and retirement of
its licensees' facilities, which cannot be recovered by competitively-priced
electric service, are borne by the licensees and that the U.S.
taxpayers and energy consumers are held harmless for such costs.</H4>

U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission

Strategic Assessment and Re-baselining Project

Comments of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project

Introduction:
Public Citizen welcomes the opportunity to participate in the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission's strategic assessment and re-baselining project.  
We believe a re-baselining of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is long 
over due. In 1987, the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of 
the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs characterized the NRC 
as being "too cozy with industry".  It concluded that "first, the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission has not maintained an arms length posture with the 
commercial nuclear power industry. Second, the NRC has, in some critical 
areas, abdicated its role as a regulator all together." (U.S. Congress, 
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, House Committee on Interior 
and Insular Affairs, NRC Coziness with Industry: An Investigative Report, 
100th Cong., 1st Sess., December, 1987)   This characterization is as 
true today as it was nearly ten years ago.  As a result, NRC has failed 
to adequately protect the public health and safety.

Since the NRC first announced its intention to under take this project in 
August 1995 , the need for such an assessment has become even more 
readily apparent. 

	In October 1995, the U.S. General Accounting Office reported 
weakness in  the NRC Inspection program at the South Texas nuclear power 
plant.  The GAO found that equipment outages at South Texas "violated 
several NRC requirements for the safe operation of the reactor and 
substantially increased the likelihood that the reactor's core could be 
damaged in an emergency."  (U.S. GAO, Weakness in NRC Inspection Program 
at the South Texas Nuclear Power Plant, GAO/RCED-96-10, p.2.)  
Furthermore the GAO found that NRC failed to identify the underlying 
safety problems until after South Texas was forced to shut down.  By 
then, the problems had become so bad that it took the licensee more than 
a year to address them.

	On March 5, 1996, Time ran a cover story on Connecticut's 
Millstone reactors that detailed significant nuclear safety violations 
which endangered the public health and safety. The Time story revealed a 
legacy of neglect by the NRC which allowed Millstone to operate outside 
of its design basis for decades. 

	On May 8, 1996, the NRC Inspector General (IG) released a report
entitled NRC Staff's Actions Related To Regulation At Maine Yankee.  The report 
determined that until allegations arose, the NRC staff was unaware that 
Maine Yankee was not in compliance with its Safety Evaluation Report and 
had not been in compliance since the SER was issued in 1989.  The IG 
found several examples where the staff had relied upon the licensee to 
follow NRC requirements and regulations; however, the licensee did not in 
fact comply.  Most disturbing of all, the IG found that NRC project 
managers, technical staff managers and senior officials had several 
opportunities to resolve the problem but failed to do so. (U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, Office of Inspector General, NRC Staff's Actions 
Related To Regulation At Maine Yankee, Case No. 96-04S, May 8, 1996, p. 4)
On May 31, 1996 the NRC IG found that despite a declining level of 
performance at Millstone since 1991, NRC had not placed Millstone on the 
Watch List.  The NRC's Executive Director for Operations James Taylor, 
Region I Administrator Tim Martin and Mr. William Russell Director of 
Reactor Regulation all told the IG "that given the indicators of poor 
performance at Millstone, the NRC should have taken more aggressive 
action including placing Millstone on the NRC watch list as early as 
1993." (U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of Inspector General, 
NRC Staff's Actions to Address Northeast Utilities System (NU) 1991 Self 
Assessments, Case No. 96-02S, May 31, 1996, p. 3.)
In July 1996  NRC Inspector General found that the NRC inspection reports 
failed to address the problems at Millstone and that NRC would have 
closed the issue if the whistleblower had not filed a 2.206 petition. 
(U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of Inspector General, NRC 
Handling of Issues Related to Refueling Operations at Millstone Unit 1, 
Case No. 96-05S, July 23, 1996)  It was later revealed that at least 15 
nuclear reactors were operating in the same unsafe manner as Millstone 1.
NRC needs to re-establish its credibility as a regulator.  Unless this is 
recognized and acted upon this current re-baselining effort is bound to 
fail. 

PUBLIC CITIZEN COMMENTS ON NRC'S STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT ISSUE PAPER DSI 
11:  OPERATING REACTOR PROGRAM OVERSIGHT

The failure of the NRC to identify the safety problems at Millstone 
Haddam neck and Maine Yankee reactors has severely damaged the agency's 
credibility.  The NRC has long been accused of being too cozy with the 
nuclear industry and many of the proposals considered in this initiative 
will further blur the lines between the regulated and the regulator. In 
all three areas under consideration: licensing,  inspection, &  
performance assessment, the nuclear industry has proven that it can not 
be trusted to regulate itself and unfortunately NRC has not been doing 
the job.  

The NRC has put forth three options:
	
	Option 1:  Review the reactor oversight processes in the context 
of lessons learned from current issues and develop processes and 
mechanisms to provide for systematic reexamination of reactor oversight 
activities to ensure their continued effectiveness

	Option 2:  Seek new approaches to improve effectiveness, work 
with the industry to foster an environment that is conducive to continued 
improvements in performance, and provide increased opportunities for 
public involvement in the regulatory process.

	Option 3:  Perform a Business Process Reengineering 

	Public Citizen supports option one.

	The NRC has lost its credibility as a regulator and needs to 
re-establish that its licensees meet all NRC requirements.  The NRC's 
50.54 letter regarding the adequacy and availability of design basis 
information is long over due.  The NRC has known since 1980 that 
licensees were failing to maintain the documentation upon which the NRC 
based the issuance of a license.  In a memo to the Commissioners, the 
Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation stated that "(t)he problem of 
documentation of conformance  with the Commission's regulations is a 
vexing, manpower intensive effort to which the staff, due to time and man 
power limitations, has been forced to give inadequate attention." (Memo 
from Harold Denton, Director, Nuclear Reactor Regulation, to the 
Commissioners, RE: Compliance of NRC Licenses with NRC Regulations, 
Regulatory Guides, Branch Technical Positions, And Licensee Commitments, 
July 23, 1980, p. 5.)  The staff's inattention to this problem has become 
evident in the shut downs of the Millstone and Haddam Neck reactors.  
Unfortunately Millstone is not unique. The NRC staff has found that many 
licensees have failed to appropriately maintain or adhere to plant design 
bases, appropriately maintain or adhere to the plant licensing basis, 
comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and NRC regulations and 
assure that final safety analysis reports properly reflect the actual 
design and configuration of the reactor.  Since all NRC safety 
determinations are premised upon compliance with the design basis,  NRC 
does not know if any these nuclear reactors are operating safely  Since 
the NRC has been forced to address this issue, dozens of reactors have 
reported that they have been operating in unanalyzed conditions and/or 
outside of the design basis. (U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Daily 
Event Reports ) Unfortunately, the leniency that the NRC has shown toward 
licensee's who report this problem fails to send the appropriate message 
to the nuclear industry. 

	The recent revelations regarding the regulation of Maine Yankee 
is even more disconcerting.  Not only has the staff failed to identify 
problems but once identified the NRC has failed to enforce it own 
regulations.  The recent NRC IG reports reveal a pattern of NRC neglect  
that has threatened the public health and safety.  Option one would help 
NRC re-establish a modicum of credibility in the wake of recent 
revelations of incompetence, complacency and corruption n the part of the 
NRC staff.

	Public Citizen opposes options two and three

	The staff  should not undertake activities to increase the role 
of industry in the oversight of licensing.  This industry has proven that 
it can not be trusted to regulate itself.  Any further delegation of the 
NRC's regulatory responsibility to industry will only strengthen the 
perception that the regulator has been captured by the regulated.  
Expanding the opportunities for public involvement, while necessary,  is 
no substitute for strong regulation.   
	
	Public Citizen also opposes a Business Process Re-engineering. As 
the NRC acknowledges , a BPR will be costly in terms of NRC time and 
resources. Instead of re-tooling the process NRC should enforce the 
regulations that are on the books and hold the staff accountable.  

	Although NRC is conducting a review of its existing regulatory 
processes, including licensing and inspection, in response to issues 
raised at Millstone and related underlying issues at Haddam Neck and 
Maine Yankee, the problem is one of attitude not process.  NRC has been 
unwilling or unable to enforce its own regulations.  

	In June 1996, the Christian Science Monitor ran a four part 
series on the NRC and the nuclear industry.  In the series, an NRC 
inspector with 20 years of experience summed it up this way:  "If you 
polled every senior resident inspector out there, they will tell you the 
same thing: (NRC) management won't let us do our job." (Spotts, Peter, 
"Walking the Beat With a Nuclear Patrolman", Christian Science Monitor, 
June 18, 1996, p.10.)


PUBLIC CITIZEN COMMENTS ON NRC'S STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT ISSUE PAPER DSI 
13:  THE ROLE OF INDUSTRY

	The NRC has put forth a series of options regarding the role of 
the nuclear industry in its own regulation:

Option 1:  Continue Current Program
Option 2:  Expand Role of Industry
Option 3:  Increase Accreditation and Certification of Licensee Activities
Option 4:  Increase Interaction With Industry and Professional Groups 
Option 5:  Use a "Designated Industry Representative

	Public Citizen supports Option 1 in so much as the other options 
are totally inappropriate.  The NRC should take no actions to either 
substantively increase the role of industry or expand the scope or pace 
of current NRC and industry initiatives to further rely on industry 
activities.

	Public Citizen is aware of the financial constraints of the NRC.  
However, NRC's credibility as an effective industry regulator is already 
in question.  Any further reliance upon the industry will only foster the 
impression that the NRC has abdicated its regulatory role.  

	The amount of safety information available to the public has 
already been reduced through reliance upon groups like the Institute of 
Nuclear Power Operations (INPO).  Any  reliance by the NRC on industry 
groups must not lead to a further diminution of the information that is 
publicly available.  As the NRC attempts to implement its risk based 
regulatory approach,  the reliability and availability data upon which 
this regulatory philosophy is based must be made publicly available.  To 
quote Commissioner Rogers, " the industry would simply have to live with 
the down side consequences of having plant specific reliability data 
available to both the NRC and the public." (Commissioner Kenneth C. 
Rogers, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Risk Based Regulation And The 
Need For Reliability Data Collection, May 16, 1995, p. 6.)


PUBLIC CITIZEN'S COMMENTS ON NRC'S STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT ISSUE PAPER DSI 
12:  RISK-INFORMED, PERFORMANCE-BASED REGULATION

	Public Citizen believes that the NRC should move more cautiously  
regarding the implementation of risk-based regulation.  The NRC programs 
to date been more concerned with the nuclear industry's financial 
interests than the public health and safety. The Illinois Department of 
Nuclear Safety has stated that performance based regulation could not be 
"implemented in today's environment without a loss of emphasis on safety, 
an emphasis that has taken many years to establish."(U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, Framework For A Performance Based Regulatory 
Approach, NUREG/CP-0129, September 1993, p.30.)  Public Citizen is 
convinced that safety has already been and will continue to be sacrificed 
as NRC shifts its regulatory philosophy. 

	The Commission's decision on  "how fast" and "how far" the agency 
will go in implementing risk-informed, performance-based regulatory 
approaches  must also be made in light of the recent NRC IG report  The 
IG concludes that the NRC and the nuclear industry hold significantly 
different perceptions regarding performance based regulation and 
enforcement.  The IG report states:

		Recent events at the Millstone nuclear power station 
		have caused NRC to refocus its emphasis on ensuring
		licensees strictly comply with regulatory requirements,
		such as adhering to the Final Safety Analysis Report 
		(FSAR), for all nuclear power plants.  However, industry
		representatives we spoke with are concerned that this
		re-emphasis on compliance threatens the viability of the
		effort to develop risk-informed, performance based regulation.

(U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of Inspector General, NRC's 
Transition to a Risk - Informed, Performance Based Regulatory System, 
OIG/96E-18, October 4, 1996, p.5.)

	So long as the nuclear industry views risk - informed, 
performance based regulation as synonymous with non-enforcement, any move toward 
accelerating the transition will likely result in reducing the margin of 
safety at operating reactors across the country.

	The NRC provides four options for moving toward more 
risk-informed, performance-based regulatory approaches.  

Option 1:	Continue Current Process   
Option 2:	More Rigorously Assess Relationship to Public Health and Safety
Option 3:	Perform a Comprehensive Assessment of NRC Regulatory Approaches
Option 4:	Consider Risk-Informed, Performance-Based Approaches 
		Primarily in Response to Stakeholder Initiatives   

	Public Citizen supports Option 2.  The NRC should require a 
substantial increase in overall protection to public health and safety 
that would justify the level resources necessary to pursue additional 
risk-informed, performance based regulatory initiatives.  Many of the 
initiatives undertaken thus far have been geared toward saving the 
nuclear industry money rather than protecting the public health and 
safety.  In some instances,  the NRC even told the utilities how much 
money they were saving by deregulating certain requirements.  Whether 
safety has been compromised or not remains to be seen.  The impression is 
that the NRC has been deregulating safety requirements on the basis of 
how burdensome the regulation was to the licensee.  


PUBLIC CITIZEN'S COMMENTS ON NRC'S STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT ISSUE PAPER DSI 
23:  ENHANCING REGULATORY EXCELLENCE

The NRC has asked how it can enhance regulatory excellence through 
maintenance of regulatory standards, rules, and requirements.  The NRC
provides two options:

Option 1:	Continue Current Approach 
Option 2:	Initiate a More Proactive Approach to Improvement

During the past several years, the NRC has initiated a number of programs 
to evaluate its rules and regulations. The NRC continues to implement a 
program begun in 1984 to eliminate or modify regulations that supposedly 
provide incrementally small safety benefits but impose a substantial 
regulatory burden on licensees.  The main focus of the Marginal to Safety 
Program is on rulemaking and regulatory guidance identified by industry 
as being costly to implement and only marginally effective in enhancing 
safety.

In January 1993, the Executive Director for Operations (EDO) established 
a regulatory review group (RRG) to conduct a review of power reactor 
regulations placing special attention on the feasibility of substituting 
performance-based requirements and guidance for prescriptive requirements 
and guidance.  The RRG recommended specialized areas where NRC 
regulations might be changed, leading to burden reduction with little or 
no adverse impact on safety.

	However, regulations NRC's own review considered significant to 
safety were being deregulated in the NRC's Marginal to Safety Program. 
Requirements that have already been eliminated or revised or are being 
reviewed include those pertaining to containment leakage rate testing, 
main steam isolation valve leakage control systems in boiling-water 
reactors, post-accident sampling systems, and combustible gas control 
systems.

	Yet in NRC Regulatory Review, combustible gas control regulations 
were judged to have a substantial impact on safety.  Environmental 
Qualification of Electrical Equipment was also judged by the NRC' s 
regulatory review as having a substantial impact on safety yet it is 
covered by the Marginal to Safety program.  Before NRC moves ahead with 
risk informed, performance based regulation it should explain how a 
regulation can have a substantial impact on safety and yet be considered 
marginal to safety.

	If this is the NRC idea of enhancing regulatory excellence, the 
public should be wary of any further "enhancements".  The resulting 
double talk has left the public with the impression that NRC is more 
concerned with the financial health of the nuclear industry than the 
health and safety of the public.  The NRC can best enhance regulatory 
excellence by enforcing the regulations that are on the books and holding 
licensee's accountable when regulations are violated.
Furthermore, the NRC should adjust the system of fines so as to provide 
a  major penalty for violating regulations.  So long as fines are less 
expensive than the cost of shutdown,  utilities will have little 
incentive to comply with regulations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:

	The NRC and its licensees have failed to heed the warnings of the 
President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island and have 
seriously compromised both the public health and safety and their own 
credibility.

	The Kemeny Commission recognized that "fundamental changes must 
occur in the organizations, procedures, and, above all in the attitudes 
of people.  No amount of technical "fixes" will cure this underlying 
problem." (President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island, 
Report of the President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile 
Island, The Need for Change: The Legacy of TMI, Washington, 1979, pp. 24 
& 25).  Unfortunately, the NRC and the nuclear industry have forgotten 
the lessons of Three Mile Island.  They have grow complacent with this 
most unforgiving of technologies.  Strict compliance with regulation has 
given way to non-enforcement, deregulation, and cost-beneficial licensing 
actions.  Public confidence in the NRC's ability to regulate the nuclear 
industry has not been this low since the meltdown at Three Mile Island.  

	The NRC must re-establish its credibility as a strong regulator 
and protector of the public health and safety.  The Chairman and the 
Commission have taken steps that have helped in this regard such as  the 
curtailment of the enforcement discretion program and the use of specific 
criteria in assessing which plants are placed on the NRC's "watch list." 
. 

	The recent NRC IG reports have revealed a need for additional 
oversight not only of the nuclear industry but also of the NRC.  In light 
of this, Pubic Citizen would like to make several recommendations:

	First, NRC should  promulgate regulations that allow for 2.206 
type petitions that question not only at the licensee but also the NRC 
staff actions.

	Second, NRC should undertake legislation that will allow 
citizens, states or municipalities to sue the NRC to enforcement 
regulations. 

	Third, The NRC should increase the level of fines levied on NRC 
licensees so as to provide a greater incentive for complying with 
regulations.

	Fourth, NRC should make the protection of whistleblowers a top 
priority.  
Those individuals who have harassed whistleblowers should be prohibited 
from working in the nuclear industry.

	The Kemeny Commission concluded that, "unless portions of the 
industry and its regulatory agency undergo fundamental changes, they will 
over time totally destroy public confidence and, hence, they will be 
responsible for the elimination of nuclear power as a viable source of 
energy." (President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island, 
Report of the President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile 
Island, The Need for Change: The Legacy of TMI, Washington, 1979, pp. 24 
& 25)  The need for fundamental change is as evident today as it was in 
the wake of the TMI meltdown. If the industry and this agency ignore it, 
the Kemeny Commission's admonition will become a reality.

Introduction

After the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl, the U.S. House of
Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee for
Energy Conservation and Power asked the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) to provide a list of the worst nuclear plants in
the country.  The NRC responded with a preliminary list of
sixteen reactors, the NRC's first "watch list."  These problem
plants would receive greater regulatory attention in the form of
additional inspections in an effort to improve their performance. 
Every six months NRC Senior managers meet with regional
administrators and determine which reactors will be placed on the
watch list. Public Citizen submitted a Freedom of Information Act
request in an attempt to gain access to the documents used to
develop the list.  The NRC replied that there were no such
documents.1

Unfortunately, the NRC has not explained the criteria used to
create their list and the meeting where such determinations are
made is closed to the public.  Nuclear Lemons offers the public a
method for assessing relative reactor safety which can be
discussed, debated and improved upon.

Identifying the worst reactors in the country is important for
several reasons.  First, NRC funds for nuclear reactor inspection
and enforcement are limited; if the worst reactors are
identified, scarce resources can be allocated appropriately.  If
these reactors are shut down, then limited funds for nuclear
regulation may be directed to other problem plants.  Second, as
competition in the electricity industry pushes utilities toward a
phaseout of nuclear power in the United States, the worst
reactors should be the first retired.  Third, organizations other
than the NRC like the Federal Emergency Management Agency, state
regulatory agencies, and Congress should be made aware of problem
plants.  Finally, citizens have a right to know any and all
threats that nuclear power poses to their health, families,
homes, and communities.

Public Citizen has produced Nuclear Lemons based on the
conviction that the public has a right to know not only which
nuclear reactors are the worst in the nation, but also the
methods by which this assessment is made.


Notes
1.  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, letter from Donnie H.
Grimsley, Director, Division of Rules and Records, NRC FOIA-86-433, 
Aug. 1, 1986.


Summary of Findings

To determine which reactors are the lemons of the nuclear industry,
Public Citizen has ranked every reactor in the nation based on
twelve performance indicators.  Nuclear Lemons are reactors with
the worst overall performance from 1993 to 1995.

Nuclear Lemons is an overall ranking based on twelve categories. 
While reactors that are particularly poor performers in only one
category may not rank as Nuclear Lemons, their poor performance is
no less noteworthy.  For this reason, the worst reactors in each of
the twelve categories are listed below.

Since NRC began the "watch list," thirty-seven reactors operated by
eighteen utilities have been designated as problem plants a total
of 211 times.  The utilities with the most reactors on the "watch
list" have been Illinois' Commonwealth Edison and the Tennessee
Valley Authority.  Six of the twelve Commonwealth Edison reactors
have appeared on the "watch list."  The record of the Tennessee
Valley Authority is even more abysmal.  Every reactor owned by TVA,
with the exception of the newly licensed Watts Bar reactor, has
been designated as a problem plant and placed on the NRC's "watch
list."

Historically, there has been a strong correlation between Public
Citizen's Nuclear Lemons and the NRC's "watch list."  Over the past
ten years and five editions of Nuclear Lemons, only one nuclear
plant placed on NRC's "watch list" failed to rank as a Lemon.  The
findings in this edition of Nuclear Lemons indicate that many of
the worst nuclear reactors in the nation have failed to pull
themselves up from the bottom of the industry rankings, despite
increased scrutiny from the NRC.  As the NRC has designated fewer
reactors as warranting additional scrutiny, the agency has missed
significant safety problems that have eventually resulted in
extended reactor shutdowns.  The last two editions of Nuclear
Lemons indicated that the Millstone reactors in Connecticut were in
trouble.  However, the subjective determination of NRC's senior
management has resulted in regulatory inaction, which constitutes
an abrogation of the NRC statutory responsibility to protect the
public health and safety.

While the NRC has the means of assessing safety and performance
problems, it apparently lacks the will to rectify the situation. 
The NRC has allowed problem plants to continue to operate, despite
the fact that they have failed to improve their safety performance. 
The perpetually poor performance of Commonwealth Edison's Dresden
and the Tennessee Valley Authority's Browns Ferry indicates that
NRC oversight and regulation is inadequate and that the "watch
list" process is a failure. Public Citizen finds that in several
performance categories any improvements are more a function of
changes in reporting requirements or NRC policies than actual
improvement in the operation of nuclear power plants.  This is true
for six of the twelve performance indicators used in this report,
including:  capacity factors, enforcement discretion, licensee
event reports, safety system actuations,systematic assessments of
licensee performance and scrams. Additionally, the database that
tabulates violations is so inaccurate as to be almost useless for
any in-depth comparisons over time. This leads us to question how
NRC can implement performance-based regulation when it is incapable
of determining the actual performance of the nuclear reactors it
purports to regulate.

HOLD FOR RELEASE:             CONTACTS:  James Riccio (202) 546-4996

PUBLIC CITIZEN SAYS NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION SLACK ON SAFETY;  
            IDENTIFIES WORST NUCLEAR REACTORS IN NATION
                                   
          New Jersey's Salem -1 Tops List of Nuclear Lemons

Washington, DC, Oct. 9 -- Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project
(CMEP) today charged the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) with
callous disregard for public health and safety.  The advocacy group
says the NRC has failed to identify many of the most troubled nuclear
reactors in the nation, and has failed to improve the performance of
those problem reactors it has identified.  The charges are detailed in
Nuclear Lemons, a new CMEP report which lists the twenty-five worst
nuclear reactors in the nation. 

"The NRC's attempts to improve performance at troubled nuclear reactors
have been an abysmal failure," said James Riccio, staff attorney for
Public Citizen and primary author of the study.  "Although NRC Chair
Shirley Jackson has tried to toughen enforcement, the agency's old
guard is still unwilling to crack down on the worst reactors."

Nuclear Lemons determines the worst commercial nuclear reactors based
on twelve safety, economic and performance indicators.  The rankings,
which are being co-released with citizens groups across the country,
are based entirely on statistics garnered from government and industry
documents.

While the NRC keeps a "watch list" of problem plants, the agency has
never explained the criteria used to create the list, or spelled out
conditions to indicate when a reactor should be permanently closed.
"The NRC identifies its  problem plants'," said Joan Claybrook,
President of Public Citizen, "but the Commission has no established
standards by which to judge when a nuclear reactor should be shut down. 
With so many aging, deteriorating nuclear facilities threatening public
health and safety, the NRC should be closing the most dangerous plants
and moving aggressively to improve the remaining reactors. "

"Increasing competition in the electric power industry threatens the
survival of many nuclear plants that are far more expensive to operate
and maintain than other sources of power," said Bill Magavern, Director
of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project. "Instead of looking
the other way, the NRC needs to keep a much closer watch on nuclear
utilities, which will be tempted to shortchange safety in their efforts
to cut costs.  And these nuclear lemons deserve the most scrutiny."

<i>A Public Interest Blueprint for Electricity
Restructuring</b></i><p>

</center>
<p>

Competition in the electric power industry could either usher in
a new era of cleaner, more affordable energy
services or prove to be the biggest consumer shakedown of our
time.  Americans consider electricity service to be a
basic commodity, making the stakes high and the consequences
potentially very severe.<b>   <p>

<p>

</b>With this nation on the verge of a historic transformation in
the way it generates, transmits and sells electricity, the
interests of average consumers must be fully represented in
efforts to write the new rules that will govern
competition.<b>  Power for the People</b> outlines a
comprehensive vision for restructuring the electric utility
industry to
benefit consumers and the environment while encouraging free and
fair competition.  Designed for implementation at
the state level, the blueprint proposes a variety of policy
mechanisms on issues that affect all Americans.<p>

<p>

Proposals to introduce competition into electricity markets pose
new challenges to regulators and elected officials. 
Bad public policy choices could seriously harm consumers in their
pocketbooks and in the quality of their
environment.  Specifically, possible outcomes of restructuring
include:<p>

<p>

     *    higher bills for small business and residential
consumers while large consumers receive discounts.<p>

     *    degraded environmental quality through increased use of
dirty plants and fossil fuels.<p>

     *    elimination of energy efficiency programs.<p>

     *    little or no development of renewable energy
technologies.<p>

     *    discrimination against low-income and rural
customers.<p>

     *    companies taking advantage of consumers through abusive
marketing and business practices.<p>

     *    unregulated monopoly utilities able to stifle
competition and increase profits.  <p>

     *    bailing out inefficient, high-cost utilities to reward
shareholders for bad business decisions.<p>

<p>

In order to prevent these outcomes from occurring and ensure that
benefits accrue to all classes of consumers, the
blueprint proposes that states do the following:<p>

<p>

     *    grant no recovery of costs for uneconomical utility
assets except in special circumstances.<p>

     *    break up vertically integrated utility monopolies by
requiring divestiture of assets.<p>

     *    create an independent energy agency to administer and
oversee energy efficiency, low-income, universal<p>

          service and research &amp; development programs.<p>

     *    aggressively promote an array of energy efficiency
programs funded by a system benefits charge.<p>

     *    guarantee universal service and bill assistance to
low-income and rural consumers.<p>

     *    increase the use of cleaner energy by requiring all
electric service providers to certify that a percentage          
     of their energy comes from renewable technologies.<p>

     *    enact standards on fossil fuel plants ensuring that the
emissions of hazardous pollutants decreases.<p>

<p>

These issues must be addressed prior to the introduction of
competition and cannot be solved simply by hoping that
the free market will provide equitable solutions.  All markets
exist within a regulatory and policy framework that
encourages certain types of business behavior.  If a new utility
structure provides the wrong incentives to
participants, the outcome could reward wasteful energy
consumption, promote the use of dirty generation sources,
allow one company to dominate a given market, and make it more
difficult for low-income and rural consumers to
meet their basic energy needs.  State legislatures and regulatory
commissions must aggressively engage these issues
and devise rules that facilitate competition and serve the public
interest.<p>

<p>

Consumer and environmental groups seek the creation of a safe,
affordable and sustainable energy system.  To that
end, <b>Power for the People</b> offers a vision and roadmap for
progressing towards a competitive market that includes
minimum standards, structural mechanisms for delivering basic
services, protections against market
power abuses
and assurances that small customers will be the first to see any
benefits.<p>

__________________________________________________<p>

<center><b>PUBLIC INTEREST BLUEPRINT FOR ELECTRICITY
RESTRUCTURING<p>

<i><a name="Principles and Summary">Principles and
Summary</a></i><p>

</center>
<p>

<p>

CONSUMER PROTECTION<p>

</b>The entrance of many new companies into electricity markets
creates the potential for fraud, deceptive marketing
and abuse of market power.  Consumers
must be protected against unfair business practices and be
assured that
sellers of electricity are not discriminatory or dishonest. 
Informed consumer choices will only be possible if
there is full disclosure of each company's resource portfolio and
environmental impacts.  States must also
aggressively monitor compliance with all consumer protection
laws.  If not already in existence, an independent
Citizen Utility Board should be established to advocate on behalf
of small business and residential electricity
consumers. <p>

<p>

<b>COST SHIFTING</b><p>

Utility restructuring should not result in a widening gap between
the rates paid by small and large consumers of
electricity.  Unless the benefits of competition are delivered
equally to all customer classes, a disproportionate cost
burden will fall to average citizens and ratepayers.  Under no
circumstance should any consumer on the utility
system be allowed to escape responsibility for supporting
reasonable low-income, renewable energy, R&amp;D and
energy efficiency programs.  <p>

<p>

<b>CREATION OF AN INDEPENDENT ENERGY AGENCY</b><p>

Ensuring independent oversight and administration of energy
efficiency, renewable energy, low-income and R&amp;D
programs will require the creation of an independent non-profit
or government agency.  This agency will
coordinate and adopt measures to ensure that all monies collected
from the electricity system are disbursed through
competitive bidding, effectively spent and directed to
high-priority programs that serve the public interest.  Since
allowing an existing utility to administer public funds for
energy services creates an inherent conflict of interest,
this agency must not be owned, operated or directed by an
existing utility or any other company conducting
business within the state's electricity sector.<p>

<p>

<b>DIVESTITURE OF UTILITY ASSETS</b><p>

Past monopoly status must not confer competitive advantages to
utilities or their subsidiaries.  Fair and free
competition will be impossible if one entity maintains monopoly
ownership over all aspects of the utility system. 
Requiring a distribution of assets among independent companies
will enhance competition and protect consumers
from the potential abuses of monopoly control.  In order to
protect against such abuses, utilities must separate their
generation, transmission and distribution assets into distinct
and unaffiliated corporate entities.<p>

<p>

<b>ENERGY EFFICIENCY<p>

</b>The aggressive pursuit of energy efficiency must not be
compromised by the switch to competitive electricity
markets.  Energy efficiency provides significant economic savings
and pollution prevention benefits that are not
sufficiently valued.  To ensure that efficiency receives priority
in a competitive system, funds should be collected
through a nonbypassable system
benefits charge and disbursed by the Independent Energy
Agency.  Total funding
must support an increase in activity over pre-competition
efficiency efforts.  In addition, state-guaranteed access to
below-market loans for efficiency improvements would help
consumers afford capital investments that yield energy
and financial savings over time.<p>

<p>

<b><p>

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION<p>

</b>Restructuring poses serious threats to environmental quality
that must be addressed prior to the implementation of
changes.  Competition must produce improvements in environmental
quality.  States should consider a range of
mechanisms to achieve net reductions in air, liquid and solid
waste emissions, including a requirement that all
generators meet federal and state environmental standards applied
to new plants or demonstrate that equivalent
emissions reductions have been achieved at other plants within
the state.  Furthermore, all fossil and nuclear
generators should be subject to fees based on emissions and waste
generation.  <p>

<p>

<b>RENEWABLE ENERGY</b><p>

Increased reliance on renewable energy must be a priority for any
restructured system given the considerable
environmental and economic benefits that accrue from its use. 
Since the value of renewables is not accurately
reflected in conventional pricing, states must adopt strong
structural measures that harness competitive forces and
guarantee a minimum level of resource diversity.  A renewables portfolio
standard, applied to all retail suppliers
of electricity, should be used to increase resource diversity
from current levels.  The pro-competitive nature of a
portfolio standard will result in low-cost renewables that
benefit all consumers and the environment.  Issues
relating to distributed generation, system reliability, off-grid
customers, renewables project financing and self-generation must
also be addressed.<p>

<p>

<b>RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT</b><p>

As utilities, industry and the federal government cut back on
research and development efforts, states must ensure
that adequate support is available to develop and deploy new
technologies that increase transmission and
distribution efficiency, enable distributed generation and reduce
or prevent pollution.  A system
benefits charge
should fund R&amp;D efforts administered by the Independent
Energy Agency.<p>

<p>

<b>RETAIL COMPETITION<p>

</b>This blueprint does not constitute an endorsement of retail
competition.  Unresolved issues could dramatically
affect the benefits retail competition offers to small business
and residential consumers.  If, however, a state
chooses to enact retail competition, it must mitigate the most
harmful potential consequences to consumers by
ensuring that methods of meaningful customer access and
aggregation are available.  In addition, small business
and residential consumers should be able to take advantage of
retail competition at the same time as large
consumers without any barriers to full participation.<p>

<p>

<b>STRANDED COSTS<p>

</b>The transition to a competitive market must offer concrete
savings to all consumers.  Granting full utility recovery
of stranded costs would saddle ratepayers with an unprecedented
burden that precludes many from realizing any
near-term benefits from restructuring.  Utility profits have
historically reflected the assumed risk of investments in
assets that could be rendered superfluous over time.  Relieving
utilities of liability for their bad decisions would
penalize efficient utilities and consumers.  The full burden of
covering the costs for uneconomical assets should fall
upon utility shareholders unless there is conclusive proof that
state regulators, over strenuous utility objections,
required a specific investment or that the decision to build a
stranded asset was, in hindsight, the least-cost option
available to the utility.  Furthermore, cost recovery should not
include anticipated profits, lost
revenues, expenses
or liabilities associated with future operations.  Any recovery
must also be balanced against all undervalued assets
in the utility system.<p>

<p>

<b>UNIVERSAL SERVICE</b><p>

Competition must bring benefits to all consumers.  Rural and
low-income consumers have the most to lose from
restructuring unless strong protections are enacted that ensure
universal service, access to competing suppliers, bill
assistance, reasonable payment policies, emergency service and
affordable rates.  Furthermore, degraded service
and redlining must be prohibited.  Funding for energy assistance
and universal service must be adequately supported through a nonbypassable 
system charge and low-income consumers should be guaranteed sufficient
weatherization and energy efficiency services.  <p>

S. 1936 Vote Results

On Wednesday, the Senate voted 63-37 to pass S. 1936, the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act of 1996.  In passing the measure, nuclear
industry supporters lost three votes from an earlier motion to
break a filibuster against the bill.  The 37 votes against the
bill demonstrates that Congress will sustain President Clinton's
promised veto against the legislation.  A list of how Senators
voted is printed at the end of this message.

What Now?

The bill's supporters now turn to the House of Representatives,
which may or may not elect to consider nuclear waste legislation
this year.  On the whole, the prospects are looking grim for the
industry lobbyists.  If the House adopts the Senate bill as is,
President Clinton's veto will be sustained easily, finishing the
bill once and for all.  If, on the other hand, the House passes a
differing version, the bill will have to go to a House-Senate
conference and be passed by both bodies again before being sent
to the President.  The remaining time on the legislative
calendar, however, is quite short, and the conference process
would give Senators Bryan and Reid the opportunity to launch two
additional filibusters against the bill. 

What you can do.

While there is cause for optimism, we should not breathe
completely easily yet.  The nuclear lobby will no doubt try to
place pressure on both the President and the House over the
August recess, and we need to exert a countervailing force. 
Please call the White House and thank President Clinton for
promising a veto of S. 1936 and tell him to hold firm against
industry pressure.  Then call your Representative and ask him or
her to oppose H.R. 1020, S. 1936's House counterpart, and any
similar legislation.  Also, be sure to thank your Senator(s) who
opposed the bill.

The White House Switchboard number is (202)456-1111; the Capitol
Switchboard number, (202)224-3121.  Direct line and fax numbers
as well as email addresses for Representatives and Senators can
be found on Critical Mass' voting index
(http://www.essential.org/CMEP).

Many thanks to everyone who has worked against the nuclear waste
bills this year.  Your efforts have made a difference.

Finally, as noted in an earlier posting, I am about to leave
Public Citizen for the dubious pleasures of law school.  While
the Senate vote made my exit a little later than planned, this is
my last posting to the CMEP list.  I will maintain my current
email address for some time, but future inquiries on Public
Citizen's work on nuclear waste policy should be directed to Bill
Magavern (magavern@citizen.org).

For Immediate Release
          Contact:  Michael Grynberg    (202)546-4996
                    Bill Magavern       (202)546-4996
July 31, 1996                           

Senate Passes Anti-Environmental Nuclear Waste Bill; 
Industry Supporters Fail to Attain "Veto-Proof" Majority

     Millions of dollars of industry lobbying bore fruit today as
the Senate voted to slash environmental standards, preempt state
law, and force some of the deadliest materials ever created upon
Nevada before studies are complete on whether Yucca Mountain in
the state is a suitable site for a permanent repository for these
materials.  While the bill failed to receive enough votes to
override President Clinton's promised veto, many Senators cast
aside concern for the environment to satisfy the industry's
whims.

     "It's easy to be an environmentalist when you're worried
about burning rain forests half a world away," Michael Grynberg,
Energy Policy Analyst with Public Citizen, said.  "The true test
is voting your principles when corporate interests in your state
want the opposite.  While too many Senators failed that test
today, enough voted their principles to ensure that this
irresponsible bill never becomes law."            

     S. 1936 contains broad preemptions of federal and state
environmental laws.  The measure also interferes with the
Environmental Protection Agency's authority to issue standards to
protect citizens from radiation releases from a repository. 
Instead the bill sets a lax exposure standard that permits four
times the radiation of current storage guidelines and is
associated with one excess cancer death for every 286 exposed
individuals. 

     The bill's hostility to sound policy and environmental
safeguards earned the legislation a veto promise from President
Clinton.  Today's vote demonstrates that the industry will be
unable to pass the bill this session.

     "A majority of Senators decided to look out for the special
interests of the nuclear industry," Bill Magavern, Director of
Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project, said. 
"Fortunately, President Clinton is looking out for the national
interest on this issue."

     S. 1936 would also require the taxpayer to assume title to
and liability for the deadly garbage that the nuclear industry
chose to create.  By limiting the user fee earmarked for the
nation's disposal program, S. 1936 leaves taxpayers facing a
liability that could reach billions.

     "No one has presented a valid reason to start shipping waste
to Nevada now," Grynberg said, citing the non-partisan Nuclear
Waste Technical Review Board's recommendation to wait on
centralized "interim" storage.  "Using citizen safety and
taxpayer dollars to subsidize the nuclear industry is corporate
welfare of the worst kind."

Nuclear Waste Bill to Receive Final Vote on Wednesday

Prior to a planned cloture vote on Thursday, the Senate reached a
unanimous consent agreement to vote on final passage of S. 1936,
the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996, on Wednesday, July 31.  In
return for ending their filibuster of the bill, Senators Bryan
and Reid (both D-NV) managed to delay the vote on final passage
by several days.

While the bill is expected to pass, the nuclear industry is not
expected to have the votes necessary to override a promised veto
from President Clinton.  We need to make sure this remains the
case.  As repetitive as this must seem, the importance of calls
to Congress only increases.  Please call your Senators and ask
them to oppose S. 1936.  Then call your Representative and ask
him or her to oppose H.R. 1020, the House counterpart to S. 1936. 
The nuclear lobbyists are pressuring the House to consider that
bill next week.

The Capitol Switchboard number is (202)224-3121.  Direct
line and fax numbers as well as email addresses for Senators can
be found on Critical Mass' voting index
(http://www.essential.org/CMEP).

Court Decision Obscures Waste Debate

One argument you may hear in calling congressional offices is
that the courts have just ruled that the Department of Energy
must take utility waste in 1998.  On Tuesday the D.C. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled that the DOE does have a contract with
utilities to start "disposing" of utility fuel in 1998.  While
the ruling contains many errors, and may indeed be appealed, it
is important to note what the ruling does not say.  Nothing in
the ruling directs the government to slash environmental
standards or force a dump on Nevada.  Indeed, building interim
storage in Nevada or, in the case of every other state, before a
license is issued for a permanent facility would violate existing
law.  

The ruling leaves open the question of what remedies would be
necessary if the government breaches its contract, but one should
remember that regardless of whether S. 1936 passes or not, the
government will not be able to begin accepting fuel in 1998. 
Most importantly, the ruling acknowledges the fact that the
government is not required to take title to irradiated fuel until
a disposal capacity for the materials exists.  "Disposal," as
defined by current law and cited by the judges, is "emplacement
in a repository of ... spent nuclear fuel ... with no foreseeable
intent of recovery." The panel wrote, "it is not unusual,
particularly in the nuclear area, to recognize a division between
ownership of materials and other obligations relating to such
materials."  In other words, taxpayers need not shoulder the
liability for these materials until a long-term plan is in place. 
S. 1936, however, transfers title and liability to the taxpayer
beginning in 1999.

HOUSE PASSES AMENDMENT TO RESTORE RENEWABLES FUNDING, DEFEATS
ATTEMPTS TO SLICE NUCLEAR PORK PROGRAMS

This morning, the House of Representatives voted on three
amendments to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill for 1997,
S.3814. These three amendments all had the support of Public
Citizen and others in the safe energy movement.

1. Victory on renewables -- By a stunning margin of 279-135, the
House approved an amendment by Reps. Dan Schaefer (R-CO), Scott
Klug (D-WI), Vic Fazio (D-CA), Karen Thurman (D-CA), David Minge
(D-MN), Ed Markey (D-MA) and Matt Salmon (R-AZ) to restore about
$42 million in funding for renewable energy programs at the Dept.
of Energy. The amendment brings funding in the House bill to $2
million less than in 1996. Opposition to the proposal was led by
John Myers (R-IN), Joe Knollenberg (R-MI) and Bob Walker (R-PA),
all of whom spoke derisively about renewable energy. The huge
margin of victory (a similar amendment last year passed by only 6
votes) demonstrates the breadth and depth of support for
renewables on the House floor, and also shows how out of touch
the Appropriations Committee is when it guts renewables programs
while doling out cash to nuclear pork projects. Of the funds
restored by the amendment, $22.5 million will go to wind energy,
which the committee would have zeroed out entirely, with $7
million to photovoltaics, and the rest spread among many smaller
programs.

2. Narrow defeat on Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) -- In a
big disappointment to environmental, taxpayer and consumer
groups, the House rejected by 198-211 an amendment to terminate
the corporate welfare ALWR program at DOE. Reps. David Obey (D-
WI), Mark Foley (R-FL), Ed Markey (D-MA), Dana Rohrabacher (R-
CA), David Minge (D-MN) and Ed Royce (R-CA) ably argued for
terminating the boondoggle, but Myers, Walker, Bob Livingston (R-
LA) and George Brown (D-CA) all called for another "last year"
for the pork that they had said was in its "last year" a year
ago. With the help of the DOE, ALWR proponents even pulled out
the absurd claim that terminating the program would cost more
than continuing it, despite the fact that ALWR does not involve
government facilities -- it involves writing checks to huge
multinationals Westinghouse and GE.

3. Lopsided defeat on Pyroprocessing -- Markey's amendment to
terminate DOE's pyroprocessing program failed, 138-278. Opposing
the amendment were Reps. Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Harris Fawell (R-
IL), in whose districts the money is spent, and usual suspects
Myers, Brown and Walker, who support anything related to nuclear
power. Also speaking in favor of this remnant of the Advanced
Liquid Metal Reactor was Vern Ehlers (R-MI), who at least
admitted what pyroprocessing's proponents usually deny -- that it
is a reprocessing technology. Markey's amendment was supported by
environmental, consumer, taxpayer and non-proliferation groups.

Where we go from here: the Senate will probably take up energy
and water appropriations next week. We expect Sens. Jim Jeffords
(R-VT) and Bill Roth (R-DE) to offer an amendment to increase
renewables spending. Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Russ Feingold (D-
WI), Judd Gregg (R-NH) and John Kerry (D-MA) have introduced a
bill, S.1958, to terminate the ALWR, and they will offer an
amendment on the floor to remove funding for the program. Please
call, fax or email your senators in support of those amendments.

ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS BILL TO GO TO HOUSE FLOOR 
NEXT WEEK.  AMENDMENTS TO BE OFFERED TO HELP RENEWABLES, END ADVANCED
LIGHT WATER REACTOR AND PYROPROCESSING PROGRAMS

As early as Tuesday, July 22, the Energy and Water Appropriations
bill (not yet numbered) for fiscal year 1997 will be considered
by the full House of Representatives.  We expect the following
amendments will be introduced on the floor of the House.  Please
call, fax, or email your Representative by Tuesday and tell him
or her to support the following amendments.

RENEWABLE ENERGY

Representatives Dan Schaefer (R-CO), Scott Klug (R-WI), Karen
Thurman (D-FL), David Minge (D-MN), Matt Salmon (R-AZ), and Vic
Fazio (D-CA), will offer an amendment to restore about $42
million to renewable energy programs. As it currently stands, the
spending bill would cut renewables funding from $275 million this
year to $231 million. To enhance our environment and our economy,
solar, wind, geothermal and biomass energy programs should be
strengthened, not weakened.
URGE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE TO SUPPORT THE SCHAEFER-KLUG AMENDMENT.


ADVANCED LIGHT WATER REACTOR

Representatives Mark Foley (R-FL), David Obey (D-WI), Edward
Markey (D-MA), David Minge (D-MN), Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), and
Edward Royce (R-CA) will offer an amendment to save $17 million
by eliminating the Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) program,
which helps the nuclear industy prepare to build new reactors. 
The ALWR is welfare for huge corporations trying to sell reactors
in foreign markets.  No domestic utility will build a new
reactor, so why are taxpayers footing the bill?
URGE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE TO SUPPORT THE FOLEY-OBEY AMENDMENT.



PYROPROCESSING

Representative Edward Markey (D-MA) will offer an amendment to
cut funding for "pyroprocessing," a leftover reprocessing
technology from a reactor project that Congress terminated in
1994.  Reprocessing poses proliferation and environmental risks
by enabling the separation of nuclear weapons material and
complicating disposition of high-level nuclear waste.  The bill
currently directs $45 million to this needless program.  
URGE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE TO SUPPORT THE MARKEY AMENDMENT.

Senate Breaks First Filibuster; Waste Bill Receives Enough No
Votes to Sustain Clinton Veto

The first vote on S. 1936, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, was like
the proverbial glass of water: half empty or half full, depending
on one's perspective.

Unfortunately, supporters broke the filibuster on the motion to
proceed to the bill (the question of whether the Senate would
consider the legislation) by a 65-34 vote.  The 34 votes,
however, will be enough to sustain the veto of the legislation
promised by President Clinton if cast on final passage.

The next cloture vote, which will be on whether to vote on the
bill itself, is more important.  At the moment, this vote is
expected early next week.

Because this vote was only on the question of whether to consider
the bill, we can hope to pick up a few more opponents of the bill
on the next vote.  Equally, if not more, important is ensuring
that the "No" votes remain firm.  The nuclear utilities will only
increase their pressure in the next few days.  We need, as
always, calls from the grassroots to provide a counterweight to
the industry dollars.

If your Senator supported the filibuster and opposed the bill,
please call and thank him or her for the vote and ask her or him
to continue to vote against the bill.  If your Senator voted for
S. 1936, call to express your disappointment and your expectation
that they will support the Bryan-Reid filibuster on the next
cloture vote and oppose the bill as a whole. 

The Capitol Switchboard number is (202)224-3121.  Direct
line and fax numbers as well as email addresses for Senators can
be found on Critical Mass' voting index
(http://www.essential.org/CMEP).

A record of the vote and Public Citizen's press release follows. 
Keep in mind that this was a vote on whether to debate the bill;
many of those supporting S. 1936 at this stage may not do so in
the future.  In other words we can still get them to our side.

Senate Moves Closer to Passing Anti-Environmental Nuclear Waste
Bill

     The Senate opened a debate on whether to do the nuclear
industry's bidding and ram hazardous waste down the throat of an
unwilling host, voting to break the first of two filibusters on
S. 1936, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996.

     Industry lobbyists have mounted a well-financed campaign to
slash environmental standards, preempt state law, and force some
of the deadliest materials ever created upon Nevada before
studies are complete on whether Yucca Mountain in the state is a
suitable site for a permanent repository for these materials.

     "It's easy to be an environmentalist when you're worried
about burning rain forests half a world away," Michael Grynberg,
Energy Policy Analyst with Public Citizen, said.  "The true test
is voting your principles when corporate interests in your state
want the opposite.  Today, too many Senators failed that test."  
          
     S. 1936 contains broad preemptions of federal and state
environmental laws.  The measure also forbids the Environmental
Protection Agency from issuing standards to protect citizens from
radiation releases from a repository.  Instead the bill sets a
lax exposure standard that permits four times the radiation of
current storage guidelines and is associated with one excess
cancer death for every 286 exposed individuals. 

     "The nuclear industry seems to be punishing Nevada for its
wise choice to avoid the costs and perils of nuclear power," Bill
Magavern, Director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy
Project, said.  "Apparently, the industry thinks Nevadans can
take more radiation than the rest of us."

     S. 1936 would also require the taxpayer to assume title to
and liability for the deadly garbage that the nuclear industry
chose to create.  By limiting the user fee earmarked for the
nation's disposal program, S. 1936 leaves taxpayers facing a
liability that could reach billions.

     "No one has presented a valid reason to start shipping waste
to Nevada now," Grynberg said, citing the non-partisan Nuclear
Waste Technical Review Board's recommendation to wait on
centralized "interim" storage.  "Using citizen safety and
taxpayer dollars to subsidize the nuclear industry is corporate
welfare of the worst kind."

<PRE>
On June 27th, Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project participated 
in a public meeting concerning the federal policy on the purchase and 
stockpiling of potassium iodide for use by the general public in 
radiological emergencies at commercial nuclear power plants. Potassium 
Iodide is an inexpensive non prescription drug that would protect the 
thyroid gland from radioactive Iodine 131 released during a meltdown.

There were a total of 14 individual or organizations that presented
comments to the Federal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committee. 
Only 5 of the 14 presenters were in favor of providing potassium iodide to
the public in the event of a severe accident at a nuclear reactor.  The
representatives of the nuclear industry and of state emergency planning
agencies all opposed stockpiling potassium iodide.  The states are afraid
of liability problems involved with disbursing the drug.  The Nuclear
Energy Institute and Duke Power, a nuclear utility, claimed their reactors
were safe and potassium iodide was not needed. 

Public Citizen supports the stockpiling and pre-distribution of potassium
iodide to those within a 50 mile radius of a nuclear reactor.  If you
would like more information on the meeting or on potassium iodide in
general you can e-mail Jim Riccio at jriccio@mindspring.com or call
770-451-7372.  The docket of this meeting is open until July 12th so
groups and individuals can still submit comments.  Citizens should also
contact their respective state emergency planning offices and demand that
they stockpile potassium iodide. 


Comments of Public Citizen s Critical Mass Energy Project

Before the Federal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committee's

Ad Hoc Subcommittee on Potassium Iodide

June 27, 1996


Good Morning.  My name is James Riccio. I am the staff attorney for Public
Citizen s Critical Mass Energy Project.  Public Citizen is a consumer
advocacy organization founded by Ralph Nader in 1971, Critical Mass was
founded in 1974 to address the dangers posed by nuclear reactors and the
long lived radioactive wastes they produce. 

Public Citizen has long advocated the stockpiling and distribution of
potassium iodide (KI) to populations living in a 50 mile radius of all
commercial nuclear reactors. The long standing failure of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) to require all commercial reactor licensees to
provide KI to surrounding populations is a disgrace.  The nuclear industry
and its lobbyists have successfully quashed previous attempts to require
the stockpiling and distribution of KI.  The NRC has acquiesced to
industry pressure much to the detriment of the public health and safety. 

The industry's argument that stockpiling and distribution of KI would
unreasonably raise the fears of the public, is both specious and self
serving.  The public is already well aware of the dangers posed by nuclear
reactors.  Providing an additional level of radiation protection in the
event of an accidental release will not unduly raise the fears of those
who already live in the shadows of nuclear reactors. 

In the aftermath of the partial core-melt accident at Three Mile Island,
the NRC acknowledged that safe siting and design-engineered features alone
do not optimize protection of the public health and safety.  The NRC added
that although emergency planning had previously been considered a
secondary and additional means of protecting the public, its perspective
had been, "severely altered by the unexpected sequence of events that
occurred at Three Mile Island." (44 Fed. Reg. 75167) The Commission
concluded that, "the protection provided by safe siting and engineered
safety features must be bolstered by the ability to take protective
measures during the course of an accident." (44 Fed. Reg. 75169). 

The President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island, known as
the Kemeny Commission, was highly critical of the failure to stockpile KI. 
Among the Kemeny Commission's major recommendations was that an adequate
supply of the radiation protective agent, potassium iodide, should be
available regionally for distribution to the general population and
workers affected by a radiological emergency.  (60 Fed. Reg. 58257). 
While the NRC endorsed the Kemeny Commission position in 1979 when it was
released, the Commission has taken no steps to ensure its implementation. 

The Commission has already recognized that in the event of an accident,
potassium iodide could prove effective and useful under certain
conditions. Therefore, the NRC's unwillingness to implement the Kemeny
Commission recommendations regarding the stockpiling and distribution of
KI is an abrogation of the Commission's statutory responsibility to
protect the public health and safety. The decision by former Commissioners
DePlanque and Remick to block the stockpiling and distribution of KI can
not logically be supported. 

The cost-benefit analysis upon which the current policy is based relies on
unrealistic assumptions about the probability of severe accidents.  The
probabilistic risk assessment which underlies the cost-benefit assumptions
concludes that a severe accident could occur only once in 1000 years.
However, the NRC has acknowledged that severe accidents might be 100 times
more likely.  Shortly after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, NRC Commissioner
James Asselstine testified to Congress that there was a 45% chance of a
severe core meltdown at a commercial nuclear reactor within twenty years.
(James K. Asselstine, Testimony before the Energy Conservation and Power
Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, May 22, 1986.)

However, we need not rely on probabilistic analysis.  The history of
severe accidents at U.S. reactors reveals that the NRC's PRAs are overly
optimistic. Rather than one severe accident in 1000 years, America's
nuclear experience includes five partial core melt accidents in 40 years.
Reactors which have experienced partial core melts include:  EBR-1 on Nov.
29, 1955; WTR on April 3, 1960; SL-1 on Jan. 3, 1961; Fermi 1 on Oct. 5,
1966 and Three Mile Island 2 on March 28, 1979.  In light of this fact,
the Commission's reliance upon PRAs to obviate the need for stockpiling
and predistribution of KI is at best specious and at worst constitutes an
abrogation of NRC's statutory responsibility to protect the public health
and safety.  The intransigence of former NRC Commissioners, in light of
the staff's support for rewriting NRC's policy on KI, is incomprehensible. 
It reveals that the NRC and the nuclear industry have learned little from
the costly accidents at TMI and Chernobyl.  A decade and a half after
Three Mile Island, the findings of NRC's own Special Inquiry Group still
hold true. 

The NRC...treats radiation protection as secondary in importance to
production (of electricity).... The NRC safety reviews have been hardware
oriented.  The focus of those reviews has been on equipment and
engineering safeguard features to mitigate and safeguard against
accidents. As a result, the belief that "accidents can't happen" has
colored the agency's approach to radiation protection....We find that the
attitude that radiation protection was of secondary importance was held by
the NRC. 

(J. Rogovin et al., Three Mile Island: A Report to the Commissioners and
the Public, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, January 1980.)

Although many licensees have KI on site to protect their workers, we know
of only one state that has actually stockpiled and pre-distributed KI for
public use in the event of an accident.  The State of Tennessee stores KI
at strategic locations and will distribute upon request to people within a
five mile radius of a reactor site.  Tennessee also issues KI to those
residents within the 10 mile EPZ who volunteer to come and get it.(U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Safety Evaluation Report related to the
operation of Watts Bar Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2, Dockets 50-390 and
50-391, SSER 13, April 1994, p. 13-13). 

While several other states (Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky,
Michigan and Vermont) have "plans" to distribute KI to the general public,
the efficacy of these plans is questionable.  Potassium Iodide is most
effective if administered prior to radiation exposure.  Seemingly, this
would make pre-distribution of KI imperative.  The tragic comedy of errors
surrounding the attempts to distribute KI in the wake of the Three Mile
Island accident only serves to highlight the need for pre-distribution. 

Stockpiling and pre-distribution of potassium iodide would bring U.S.
policy into line with what has become an accepted practice among many
nuclear nations since the Chernobyl accident.  Furthermore, it would help
provide an equal level of radiation protection to all U.S. citizens
residing in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant. 

The Commission has already concluded that siting and design are not enough
to protect the public in the event of a nuclear accident.  The Commission
and almost all experts acknowledge that potassium iodide can be an
effective ancillary protective action if taken during a nuclear power
plant accident.  However, the NRC does not require stockpiling or
predistribution of KI so that it could be made available to provide
protection to members of the public.  This logical inconsistency can no
longer be tolerated. 

The NRC's obfuscation and delay in implementing the Kemeny Commission
recommendations to stockpile and distribute potassium iodide constitutes
an abrogation of the Commission's statutory responsibility to protect the
public health and safety.  I hope that this committee will act
expeditiously to remedy this unacceptable situation.  I thank you for your
time and consideration.

NEW RENEWABLE ENERGY REPORT CALLS GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR
COMMERCIALIZATION ESSENTIAL, CRITICIZES CONGRESSIONAL CUTBACKS

While debate continues in Congress over the future of renewable
energy, a new report released today by Public Citizen shows that
government policies designed to bring new technologies into the
market are essential to the successful development of alternative
energy sources.  After reviewing the experience of the Department
of Energy's (DOE) wind and ocean thermal programs, the study
concludes that government policy must couple laboratory
research with strategic efforts to deploy new technologies in
cooperation with the private sector.  Key Congressional
committees have recently criticized DOE's efforts to develop new
renewable energy technologies with private companies and
recommended funding cutbacks in the fiscal year 1997 budget.

"America has a vital interest in renewable energy, and government
should work cooperatively with industry to manufacture and market
new technologies," said Lisa Brooks, Researcher for Public
Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project.  "If Congress succeeds in
cutting off funds for commercialization, research efforts at DOE
will be undermined and the prospects for clean energy will be
placed at risk."

The report, Renewable Energy Sourcebook: A Primer for Action -
Section II: Wind and Ocean Energy, finds that current DOE
programs have benefitted from difficult lessons learned during
the 1970s and 80s by ensuring that federal money is used to
leverage substantial private investment in new technology
development.  This approach, according to the authors, is
essential to avoid the problems experienced in the early wind and
ocean energy programs.

Early wind programs in the late 1970s rushed to build large-scale
machines prematurely and fully funded the work of large defense
contractors at the expense of smaller, more innovative companies. 
When government funding for the large prototypes ended, defense
contractors lost interest and failed to invest their own money. 
Not one of the companies funded to develop a large prototype is
actively designing or manufacturing wind technologies today.

At the other end of the spectrum, government support for ocean
thermal technologies failed to include working with private
sector partners and the program never provided sufficient
information on how the systems would perform.  DOE severely
scaled back support for ocean energy in 1981 just as the program
was set to share the costs of building full-scale plants with
private companies.  According to the authors, "had this effort
gone forward, federal support for ocean energy technologies could
have become a major success story."  Instead, ocean energy
systems never made it into commercial production.

"DOE's failure to commercialize ocean energy systems stands as a
stark example of the risks inherent in abandoning new
technologies without providing adequate follow-through," said
Matthew Freedman, Energy Policy Analyst with Public Citizen.  "We
cannot afford any more missed opportunities with wind and other
renewable energy technologies."

Renewable energy programs were slashed by 30 percent last year,
and some members are poised to cut even further into DOE's work
with small renewable energy businesses.  In the Fiscal Year 1997
House Budget Resolution, Budget Committee Vice-Chairman Robert
Walker (R-PA) called for phasing out federal support for bringing
emerging renewable energy and efficiency technologies into the
marketplace while still providing ample funding for corporate
giants like Westinghouse and General Electric to work on new
nuclear reactor designs.

"Bob Walker would take us back to the failed energy policies of
the Reagan years.  By prematurely dropping support for renewable
energy programs, Congress would sabotage the last two decades of
federal research," said Freedman.  "The renewable energy
industries are still in their infancy and face many barriers to
competing with conventional energy technologies.  Repeating the
mistakes of the early 1980s would only harm small, innovative
companies that promise to be the engine of future economic
growth, jobs and exports."

The Public Citizen report praises DOE's current wind energy
commercialization strategy and concludes that "DOE support will
be critical to ensuring that the next generation of wind
technologies meets the needs of new buyers, varied resource
conditions and severe cost pressures."  The need for government
involvement is enhanced by the uncertainty resulting from
electric utility restructuring, which has "caused utilities to
virtually halt investments in new power plants, especially wind
energy facilities."

In light of concerns over the pollution and price volatility
associated with fossil and nuclear fuels, the report concludes
that "the increased use of renewable resources will move the
nation towards a more sustainable energy path that will result in
a cleaner environment, economic growth and affordable prices for
consumers."

Public Citizen publications office (202-588-1000).  Discounts are 
available for public interest organizations.

anti-CAFE rider currently attached to the bill.  The letter follows.

Please contact your Representative and let her/him know that you oppose the 
anti-CAFE rider.

OPPOSE ANTI-ENVIRONMENT RIDER TO FREEZE AUTOMOTIVE FUEL ECONOMY
STANDARDS

June 25, 1996

Dear Representative:

We urge you to oppose the anti-environmental rider in the Transportation 
Appropriations bill.  The rider freezes fuel economy (CAFE) standards for 
the second year in a row.  The bill is scheduled to go to the floor this 
week.

A vote for a CAFE freeze rider in 1996 is a vote against pollution 
reduction, national energy security, and consumer savings at the gas pump.

CAFE standards cut pollution.  By reducing oil consumption, CAFE standards 
keep 500,000 tons of carcinogenic hydrocarbon emissions from upstream 
sources -- refining and transporting of oil, and refueling at the pump -- 
out of the air we breathe.  The standards, therefore, improve air 
quality, helping polluted cities like Los Angeles and states achieve 
Clean Air Act requirements.  They also keep millions of tons of carbon 
dioxide, the prime greenhouse gas, out of the atmosphere, helping to 
curb global warming.

CAFE standards are the most successful energy saving measure Congress has 
ever adopted.  They save 3 million barrels of oil per day, reducing U.S. 
dependence on imported oil.  Without these savings the U.S. would be 
importing more oil than we currently do.  Imports now account for 52% of 
U.S. consumption and contribute $60 billion annually to the national 
trade deficit.

CAFE standards also result in consumer savings at the gas pump. Because 
fuel economy for cars doubled between 1975 and the late 1980s, a new car 
purchaser saves an average of $3,300 at the gas pump over the lifetime 
of the car.  Annually, CAFE delivers over $40 billion in consumer 
savings.  Consumers can spend these dollars in their communities on food, 
housing, and clothing instead of on imported oil.

Freezing CAFE standards prevents the Department of Transportation from 
fully implementing the law Congress passed and President Ford signed in 
1975.  The 1996 freeze stopped the rulemaking process for light truck 
fuel economy in its tracks, denying purchasers of these vehicles the 
benefits of existing fuel saving technologies.  The CAFE standard for 
light trucks -- minivans, sport utility vehicles, jeeps and pick-ups -- 
is only 20.7 mpg. These gas guzzlers now comprise over 40% of the new 
vehicle market, increasing both demand for oil and pollution.

The current moratorium was one of a series of anti-environmental riders 
which passed one or both Houses of Congress last year. The American people 
want strong environmental protection.  We urge you to oppose efforts to 
restrict this important cost-saving measure and sound environmental program.

1980s, a new car purchaser saves an average of $3,300 at the gas
pump over the lifetime of the car.  Annually, CAFE delivers over
$40 billion in consumer savings.  Consumers can spend these
dollars in their communities on food, housing, and clothing
instead of on imported oil.

Freezing CAFE standards prevents the Department of Transportation
from fully implementing the law Congress passed and President
Ford signed in 1975.  The 1996 freeze stopped the rulemaking
process for light truck fuel economy in its tracks, denying
purchasers of these vehicles the benefits of existing fuel saving
technologies.  The CAFE standard for light trucks -- minivans,
sport utility vehicles, jeeps and pick-ups -- is only 20.7 mpg. 
These gas guzzlers now comprise over 40% of the new vehicle
market, increasing both demand for oil and pollution.

The current moratorium was one of a series of anti-environmental
riders which passed one or both Houses of Congress last year. 
The American people want strong environmental protection.  We
urge you to oppose efforts to restrict this important cost-saving
measure and sound environmental program.

PUBLIC INTEREST COALITION RELEASES UTILITY RESTRUCTURING BLUEPRINT 
CALLS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE ENERGY USE 
             
A coalition of national and state public interest groups today
called for making environmental and consumer protection top
priorities in any efforts to introduce competition in the
electric utility sector.  The coalition released Power for the
People, a blueprint outlining a comprehensive set of policies
designed to protect consumers from higher bills, promote energy
efficiency and renewable energy programs, guarantee service for
low-income and rural customers and ensure that utilities do not
receive full recovery of costs associated with uneconomical
investments.

A handful of states are currently considering legislation and
regulatory changes that would radically alter their electricity
systems and introduce competition at the wholesale or retail
level.  New Hampshire, for example, recently initiated a retail
pilot program that allows consumers to choose their electricity
supplier.  At the federal level, several members of Congress are
preparing to introduce legislation that could require states to
move to competition in the next several years.

"Our blueprint represents a roadmap for moving towards a
competitive market that will benefit consumers and the
environment without bailing out utilities or abandoning strong
commitments to energy efficiency, renewable energy and low-income
consumers," said Matthew Freedman, Energy Policy Analyst for
Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project.

The blueprint, coreleased by public interest groups in eight
states, stands in stark contrast to efforts undertaken by various
industry and utility associations which fail to address many key
concerns, offer vague principles, and are designed primarily to
further a particular industry's interest.  Power for the People
provides clear and effective policies that, if implemented, would
counter the worst potential abuses of a competitive electricity
system.

On the heavily debated issue of utility stranded cost recovery,
the blueprint calls for the burden to fall on utility
shareholders in all but the most extreme circumstances. 
"Utilities must take responsibility for making bad business
decisions that resulted in uneconomical power plants.  The
ratepayer bailout now contemplated by state regulators would
force consumers to pick up the tab for windfall profits for
poorly-run utilities." said Anna Aurilio, Staff Scientist for the
U.S. Public Interest Research Group (U.S. PIRG).  Early estimates
for the recovery of these costs requested by utilities range
between $130 and $550 billion.

Policies to develop cleaner energy sources are also addressed in
the blueprint, which calls for all electricity sellers to support
a minimum portfolio of renewable energy resources at levels
higher than exist today.  "States must make renewable energy
development a priority because of its substantial environmental
and long-term economic benefits.  These benefits are likely to be
tossed aside if policymakers focus on short-term costs and ignore
the consequences of emissions from fossil and nuclear plants,"
said Wenona Hauter, Environmental Program Director for Citizen
Action.  The move to competition has already frozen many utility
commitments to new renewable resource development and threatens
to result in the loss of existing solar, wind, biomass and
geothermal projects across the country.

Risks to low-income and rural consumers could leave them
vulnerable to higher bills and poorer service in a competitive
market.  The blueprint would require that states ensure universal
service, access to competing suppliers, bill assistance,
reasonable payment policies, emergency service and affordable
rates.  "Low-income consumers and rural communities have the most
to lose in the move towards competition.  We must guarantee that
they are able to realize benefits from any new utility system,"
said Kay Guinane with Environmental Action.

Other issues covered in the blueprint include:

     - a requirement that utilities legally separate their
     business units and divest all generating plants.  States are
     also encouraged to take control of the transmission system
     and operate it themselves or under the auspices of an
     independent, non-profit agency.

     - creation of an independent energy agency to administer and
     oversee energy efficiency, low-income, universal service and
     research & development programs.

     - implementation of a system benefits charge and universal
     service charge to support energy efficiency, research &
     development, low-income, bill assistance and rural consumer
     programs.

     - a requirement that old fossil fuel plants meet the same
     emissions standards applied to new plants in order to
     compete in new electricity markets.  

The blueprint was released today by organizations in California,
Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa,  Massachusetts, Minnesota and
Texas.  A list of coreleasing groups is available on request.

Copies of Power for the People can be obtained from Public
Citizen (Telephone: 202-833-3000) at a price of $20.  Public
interest groups are eligible for discounts.

Environmental Action is a non-profit, educational research and
advocacy organization founded to clarify the critical
relationship of utility corporate structures to environmental and
consumer protection.

The arrival of competition in the electric industry still lies 
ahead.  Though many states have begun the march to restructure their 
utilities and introduce competition, vertically-integrated monopolies 
continue to dominate the generation, transmission and distribution of 
electricity.  Efforts to change this system will fundamentally alter our 
national energy policy and offer the promise of cleaner, cheaper and 
universally accessible power if the intent of this process is to further 
the public interest.  Equally possible is another scenario -- higher bills 
for small consumers, the increased use of extremely polluting energy 
sources, the consolidation of market power in fewer corporate entities, 
degraded service quality, discrimination against low-income and rural 
consumers, and unprecedented bailouts of high-cost utilities on the backs 
of powerless residential ratepayers.

        Today, our coalition releases a blueprint outlining a vision for 
competition that puts consumers and the environment first.  Our plan would 
make sustainable and affordable energy a priority by ensuring the increased 
use of renewable energy and efficiency technologies, guaranteed universal 
service, and vigorous consumer protection.  The specific mechanisms in our 
proposal represent an approach that couples market forces with minimum 
standards.  By making all companies adhere to the same requirements for 
serving the public interest, no single player or industry is disadvantaged 
and consumers can reap the benefits of competitive markets.

        We also reject the notion that inefficient, high-cost utilities 
should be compensated for their imprudent decisions to invest heavily in 
nuclear power.  When citizens rebelled against the construction of nuclear 
power stations in the 1970s and 1980s, utilities claimed that these plants 
would be inexpensive and needed to meet the vast increase in electricity 
demand projected by their own forecasters.  When increased demand failed to 
materialize and costs skyrocketed, consumers ended up buying power from 
many overpriced, dangerous and unnecessary boondoggles.  Today, we are 
calling for the utilities that forced these plants on reluctant ratepayers 
to take financial responsibility for their bad business decisions.  If 
utilities are granted full recovery of these costs, it could represent one 
of the largest public bailouts of a private industry in history.  
Furthermore, it would preclude many small consumers from realizing any 
economic benefits from competition.

        Powerful interests are hard at work to influence the outcome of 
this debate.  Industrial consumers, electric utilities and independent 
generators all have a huge stake in the rules adopted by states and the 
federal government.  Though these interests talk about the benefits likely 
to accrue to average consumers, they assume that the free market alone will 
help all consumers equally.  

        In any new system, there will be winners and losers.  If the public 
is to benefit from competition, then their interests must be paramount in 
determining which policy choices will prevail.  By placing their concerns 
first, state and federal policymakers have a chance to create a new system 
that works for consumers and the environment.  The blueprint we release 
today would move our nation towards this goal by promoting fair and free 
competition and a more sustainable energy future.

LATEST SURVEY OF FRENCH CITIZENS' VIEWS ON NUCLEAR POWER

The BVA Institute released its annual survey for 1995 focusing
on French public opinion and nuclear energy.  The survey is
important for France because nuclear power produces 80% of its
electricity.

Selected Questions from the BVA Institute Survey

Would you say nuclear power plants are polluting the rivers?     
Yes 48%   No 27%

Do you agree that nuclear power plants have considerably reduced
atmospheric pollution?   
Yes 30%   No 30%

Would you say that nuclear energy is better for the environment
than other energy sources?    
Yes 27%   No 35%

Do you agree that nuclear power plants are just like any other
plant?    
Yes 25%   No 65%

Do you agree that France could experience an accident as severe
as the Chernobyl accident?  
Yes 54%   No 29%

Would you say that French nuclear workers will experience some
health problems?    
Yes 76%   No 15%

Do you agree that France can safely store its radioactive
wastes?   
Yes 31%   No 38%

Do you think that it is very dangerous to live within 10 miles of
a nuclear power plant?   
Yes 65%   No 16%

Is the quality of information you have received concerning
nuclear industry and nuclear energy excellent?  
Yes 33%   No 59%

Do you believe that nuclear experts' explanations are extremely
hard to understand?      
Yes 67%   No 12%

Despite the French government's efforts in the last two decades
to promote nuclear energy, the results show that the French
people believe that nuclear reactors are not safe or
environmentally sound.

The Honorable Robert Livingston
Committee on Appropriations
U.S. House of Representatives
2406 Rayburn House Office Building
Washington, DC 20515

Re:  Transit and Amtrak funding

Dear Mr. Chairman:

Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy organization with over
100,000 members, urges you to maintain funding for transit and
Amtrak at the highest possible levels.

Decreased funding for mass transit has a debilitating effect on
the American public.  More than 30 million people rely on public
transportation each day to get to and from work, school, daycare
centers, shopping centers and a host of other destinations vital
to the maintenance of their quality of life.  Public
transportation brings mobility to those citizens who, for
example, cannot afford an automobile, have a disability which
prevents them from driving, are elderly or are under driving age. 
Transit effectively brings the otherwise marginalized into the
mainstream; without it millions of people would be economically
and socially stranded. 

Besides the threat that decreased funding poses to the
individual, two vital national concerns -- environmental quality
and energy security -- are also at stake.  Public transportation
benefits our environment and public health by reducing pollution
in the air we breathe and the water we drink.  It also lessens
our reliance on imported fuel, making America less vulnerable to
oil embargoes and price shocks.  It is a stalwart and necessary
component in our country's energy efficiency effort.

Mass transit and passenger rail provide a valuable public
service.  Fiscal year 1996 budget cuts to these two programs --
accounting for nearly 50% of transportation spending cuts -- were
devastating; more cuts would be disastrous.  This downward trend
must be reversed.  Public Citizen urges you to increase transit
funding and maintain Amtrak operating assistance.


Sincerely,

Bill Magavern, Director
Critical Mass Energy Project

<P>
Dear Representative:
<P>
     You may soon vote upon H.R. 558, the Texas Low-Level
Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact.  Last September, the House
voted down the measure by a convincing 243-176 tally.  On behalf
of our nation-wide membership, I urge you to oppose the measure
should it return to the floor.
<P>
     During the prolonged debate on the North American Free Trade
Agreement, considerable attention was paid to environmental
conditions on the U.S.-Mexican border.  While promises of
improving conditions in the region have not been fulfilled by
NAFTA's passage, approval of the Texas compact would create the
potential for a new environmental catastrophe in the area.
<P>
     If the Texas compact passes, a nuclear waste dump will be
constructed in Hudspeth County in a location about 16 miles away
from the Rio Grande river.  The site is seismically active and
could threaten the Rio Grande by permitting the burial of
radioactive waste, mostly generated by the nuclear power
industry, in trenches that only require 100 years of
institutional control.  Many of these "low-level" wastes,
however, will remain toxic far beyond 100 years, thus endangering
future generations.  Building the dump in the border region, an
area which has experienced more than its share of environmental
damage, also violates the 1983 La Paz Agreement with Mexico, in
which the U.S. and Mexico agreed to reduce and eliminate sources
of pollution on their shared border.
<P>
     Many of the Texas compact and dump's problems, such as the
classification of long-lived radionuclides as "low-level" waste,
hamper the nation's nuclear waste policy as a whole.  Rather than
targeting a low-income community on the Mexican border for the
nuclear industry's garbage, Congress should reject H.R. 558 and
implement instead a comprehensive independent review of the
country's nuclear waste policies and practices.  Such a review is
overdue and offers the best opportunity to replace a politically
driven program with a policy based on sound science and citizen
participation.
<P>
                              Sincerely,

<P>

69 HOUSE MEMBERS URGE TERMINATING ADVANCED LIGHT WATER REACTOR
ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS SET TO MARKUP BILL NEXT WEEK

In a May 20 letter sent to Energy and Water Appropriations
Subcommittee Chairman John Myers (R-IN), 69 House members called 
for terminating the Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) program
and providing no additional funding in fiscal year 1997. 
Representatives David Obey (D-WI) and Mark Foley (R-FL)
circulated the letter and urged their colleagues to oppose
additional support because "continuing to appropriate funds for
the ALWR program sends the wrong message that this Congress is
willing to overlook subsidies to mature, profitable industries
while asking worthwhile constituencies to sacrifice in order to
balance the budget."

The House Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee is
preparing to markup a spending bill towards the end of next
week.  Chairman Myers has been a strong supporter of the ALWR
program in the past and is expected to provide additional funds
in fiscal year 1997.

The House Budget resolution, passed last week, also contained
specific language in support of continued funding for the ALWR
program alongside deep cuts in spending on renewable energy
technologies.  The budget resolution language was written by
Budget Committee Vice-Chairman Robert Walker (R-PA) who has been 
an outspoken advocate for the ALWR program and other federal
subsidies for companies involved with nuclear power development.

PLEASE CONTACT YOUR REPRESENTATIVE IF THEY SIGNED ONTO THE
ENCLOSED LETTER AND THANK THEM FOR THEIR SUPPORT IN CUTTING
CORPORATE WELFARE FOR THE NUCLEAR POWER INDUSTRY

The Capitol switchboard can be reached at 202-224-3121.

To receive a factsheet or testimony on the ALWR program, contact 
Matthew Freedman (cmep@citizen.org / Phone: 202-546-4996).
---------------------------------------------------------------
May 20, 1996

Chairman John T. Myers
Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee
2362 Rayburn House Office Building
Washington, D.C. 20515-6020

Dear Mr. Chairman:

     We are writing to express our strong opposition to
providing new funds for the Department of Energy's (DOE)
Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) program in the fiscal year
1997 Energy and Water Appropriations bill.  This program,
created under the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) of 1992, is due to
be completed at the end of fiscal year 1996 and has received
more than $230 million in federal support over the past five
years.  While many of us have supported nuclear research and
development in the past, this year's tight budget priorities and 
the lack of private sector interest in building new nuclear
reactors make it difficult to understand why DOE wants to expand 
the program beyond its original mission.

     Already, one of the main recipients of the ALWR program
money, General Electric, has announced that it is canceling its
Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (SBWR) after receiving $50
million from DOE due to concerns that "extensive evaluations of
the market competitiveness of a 600 MWe size Advanced Light
Water Reactor have not established the commercial viability of
these designs."  The remaining reactor scheduled to receive ALWR 
support, Westinghouse's AP-600, is a similarly sized design and
faces the same market conditions that led GE to cancel the SBWR.

     Last year, proponents argued that FY 96 funding was
necessary to complete the fifth year of a five-year program. 
This year, DOE outlined plans to request funding for the next
three fiscal years.  Extending this program runs in direct
violation of EPACT, which specified that: designs must receive
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) certification by the end of
FY 96, no company could receive money for more than four years
and manufacturers are required to certify that they fully intend 
to construct these reactors in the United States.  The remaining 
ALWR design is not due to receive NRC certification until at
least 1998 and has already benefitted from at least four years
of support.  Furthermore, the reactor vendors benefitting in
this program have abandoned domestic markets and are focusing
exclusively on exports to Asia.  Westinghouse, for example,
identifies China as a prime market for its design despite the
fact that it they are currently prohibited from exporting the
AP-600 to that country.

     One troubling aspect of the ALWR program is DOE support for
NRC design certification or generic licensing of advanced
reactors. According to testimony delivered by Westinghouse
before your Subcommittee this year, a significant portion of
DOE's design certification support covers user fees charged by
NRC for the licensing of the AP-600.  This is a highly
questionable use of taxpayer dollars.  The fact that it benefits 
a mature, developed and profitable industry makes it all the
more egregious.

     We are not asking you to terminate funding for the ALWR
program as part of an anti-nuclear agenda.  The federal
government has spent more than $47 billion (in $1995) on nuclear 
fission R&D over the last five decades and Congress has
fulfilled its commitment to support Advanced Light Water
Reactors.  If the designs supported by DOE for the past five
years are promising, then the private sector should willingly
invest in their development, deployment and promotion.  If not,
then it is inappropriate to provide new taxpayer subsidies to
support products that have no market potential.

     This Congress should be serious about cutting unnecessary
corporate welfare.  Let's allow the marketplace to determine
whether or not these designs are a sound investment and avoid
having the federal government become the funder of last resort.

                              Sincerely,

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    CONTACT:  Bill Magavern  202-546-4996
Thursday, May 2, 1996              Bill Wagner    202-588-7703


STATEMENT OF BILL MAGAVERN
DIRECTOR, PUBLIC CITIZEN'S CRITICAL MASS ENERGY PROJECT

     The sudden rise in gasoline prices to the highest level
since the Persian Gulf War has everyone looking for reasons why.
The fact is that American consumers are suffering from the
effects of industry greed and governmental shortsightedness.
While the oil companies take advantage of any excuse they can
find to raise prices, auto companies continue to make gas
guzzlers, and elected officials posture for political advantage
instead of addressing the real issues.

     On April 17 Public Citizen called on the antitrust division
of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to
investigate the rapidly rising prices for gasoline, diesel fuel
and other petroleum products.  Drivers have been paying sharply
higher prices at the pump at the same time as many oil companies
have reported sharply higher profits -- some posting gains of as
much as 42 percent for the first quarter of 1996.  We applaud
Anne Bingaman, the assistant Attorney General who heads the
Justice Department's antitrust division, for appointing a task
force to look into the issue. We urge the panel to move
vigorously to uncover why the major petroleum companies have all
increased their prices so quickly at the same time.

     In addition to addressing recent profiteering, the Clinton
Administration and Congress should address the fundamental
underlying problem of U.S. oil addiction. Our transportation
system relies almost entirely on oil, about half of which is now
imported from other countries. In order to reduce our oil
dependence and our vulnerability to price shocks, the U.S. must
find ways to move people and goods without using as much oil as
we do today. We can start to kick the oil habit by making
progress in three areas: improving the gas mileage of new
passenger vehicles, replacing petroleum with alternative fuels,
and reducing the overall vehicle miles travelled. All of these
goals are attainable, but they will require political leadership
that has been sorely lacking of late.

     The current Congress has been actively hostile to fuel
efficiency. Last year, the "DeLay rider" attached by Rep. Tom
DeLay (R-TX) to the Department of Transportation's  spending bill
froze mileage standards for the light truck category (which
includes sport-utility vehicles and minivans) at the pathetically
low level of 20.7 miles per gallon. Michigan Sens. Spencer
Abraham (R) and Carl Levin (D), and Rep. Fred Upton (R) have
introduced legislation to freeze auto efficiency standards at the
current level of 27.5 mpg, the same level they were at in 1985,
despite the fact that technology exists to increase gas mileage
to 45 mpg over 10 years without sacrificing safety or
convenience. Furthermore, Congress has lifted the National
Maximum Speed Limit, and passenger vehicles travelling at 75
miles per hour use approximately 50% more fuel than they do at 55
mph. The administration, meanwhile, has never taken a strong
stand on fuel efficiency, preferring instead to placate the auto
industry, which has lobbied fiercely against any significant
mileage increases. The automakers continue to bankroll a front
group, the "Coalition for Vehicle Choice," which uses phony
arguments to oppose efficiency gains.

     Similarly, auto and oil industry lobbying has slowed
progress toward broader utilization of alternative fuels. In the
face of heavy special interest opposition, California has rolled
back its electric vehicle mandate. 

     Efforts to reduce vehicle miles travelled and the oil
dependence, pollution and congestion caused by putting more cars
on the road, have been thwarted by Congressional power brokers
allied with roadbuilding interests. Consequently, Congress has
cut funding for mass transit and other alternatives to the
single-occupant vehicle, while seeking to pour more money into
highways. We can not build our way out of the transportation
energy problem. 

     The Congressional Republicans' new ploy of seeking a 4.3
cent reduction in gas taxes is transparently political. The
present price shock has been caused by the oil companies raising
gas prices by over 20 cents since January, not by a much smaller
tax hike enacted over two years ago. The motivation behind the
repeal proposal becomes very clear when one finds out that the
Congressional leaders are considering cutting the tax only until
Jan. 1, 1997. Given the obvious motivation for such a move, why
not just have the tax end on Election Day?

CHERNOBYL: 10 YEARS LATER AMERICA IS STILL IN DENIAL

On April 26, 1986, a nuclear reactor in the Soviet Union
exploded and the word 'Chernobyl' was seared into the
consciousness of people around the world.  Ten years have passed
and we have yet to glimpse the consequences of the disaster. 
The most reliable figures available to date already establish
Chernobyl as the worst technological accident in the history of
humankind. 

     The U.S. nuclear industry and the agency that regulates it
have learned little from this disaster.  The immediate response
to Chernobyl was to belittle the Soviet design and to claim that
the accident could not happen at a U.S. nuclear reactor.  While
technically correct -- there are no soviet designed reactors in
the U.S. -- the industry's denial missed the point. 

Nuclear accidents with consequences comparable to that of
Chernobyl are possible at U.S. reactors.  During the political
fallout that followed the disaster, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission testified before congress that there is about a 45%
chance of a core melt accident somewhere in the U.S. in the next
20 years.  

     Nuclear utility executives claimed that U.S. designed
reactors had containment structures to prevent the release of
radiation and that the Chernobyl reactor had no containment.
This difference in designs is often cited as the reason
Chernobyl could not happen here.  This second denial, too, is 
incorrect.  NRC Commissioner Asselstine testified before
Congress that Chernobyl had a containment structure that was
stronger than those surrounding some U.S. nuclear reactors. The
Chernobyl containment design was based upon the theory of
pressure suppression containment.  This same concept is used in
nearly half the reactors in the U.S., 38 designed by General
Electric and  9 designed by Westinghouse.  According to the NRC,
GE Mark I designs have a 90% chance of containment failure
during a core melt accident. The NRC has acknowledged that the
containments are not designed to cope with such accidents. If a
meltdown occurs, containment failure and the release of
radiation into the environment can not be ruled out for any of
these designs. 
     
By denying that a 'Chernobyl' could happen here, the nuclear
industry has denied itself the opportunity to learn from this
tragedy.  One of the most poignant lessons of the disaster comes
from the children of Chernobyl.  The thyroid cancer rate in 
Belarussian children has increased 100% since the accident. 
Health officials expect the cancer rate to continue rising since 
pre-cancerous thyroid conditions are more common than
carcinomas. These effects could have been mitigated by the
distribution of potassium iodide, an inexpensive drug that
protects the thyroid from radiation.  

The nuclear industry is well aware of the usefulness of
potassium iodide.  Many nuclear utilities store it at the
reactor site to distribute to workers in the event of an
accident.  While providing potassium iodide for their workers,
the industry has blocked attempts by the NRC staff to provide
the same protection to the public.  Nuclear industry officials
have argued that such a policy would adversely affect the
public's confidence in nuclear power.  They have chosen
perception over protection and have persuaded the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission to do the same.  

Ten years after the Chernobyl disaster, the U.S. nuclear
industry and its regulators are still in denial.  The public is
already keenly aware of the dangers posed by nuclear reactors,
after all, what other source of electricity requires an
emergency evacuation zone.  Rather than protecting nuclear
power's tarnished image, the NRC should be protecting the public
health and safety by requiring the stockpiling of potassium
iodide for public distribution.  Since the agency can not
prevent the next Chernobyl from occurring, it should at least
provide the public with the means of mitigating the
consequences.

APPLIANCE EFFICIENCY STANDARDS STILL HANG BY A THREAD
FY 96 BUDGET STANDOFF CONTINUES

**The following alert is being issued by the American Council for
an Energy-Efficient Economy**

The House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Clinton
Administration continue to face off over the 1996 Budget, even
though the fiscal year is now more than half over.  In March,
both the House and the Senate passed an omnibus appropriations
bill (H.R. 3019, the so-called "Balanced Budget Downpayment Act,
II") to provide appropriations for the agencies that were shut
down in December and January, including the Department of Energy
programs funded in the Interior and Related Agencies
Appropriations Bill. 

Major disagreements persist over spending levels and priorities. 
Additionally, major differences remain between the Administration
and the Congress over several legislative "riders," extraneous
provisions tacked on to the appropriations bill because they
would be less likely to be enacted if considered as free-standing
legislation.

A prohibition on the issuance of energy efficiency standards
for new appliances by DOE has been included in this bill by both
the House and Senate.  Although first proposed in the summer of
1995, this moratorium on standard-setting has not yet become law,
since the Administration and Congress were never able to agree on
funding levels or legislative riders for an Interior
Appropriations Bill.  
     (Government agencies were re-opened after the shutdown by
     enactment of a so-called "Continuing Resolution" (CR) which
     provided funding at reduced levels, but without any
     legislative riders.  A series of these CR's with short
     expiration dates have been enacted as Congress and the
     Administration have been unable to agree on appropriations
     bills.  The current Continuing Resolution funds the
     government through April 24.)  
     
The Clinton Administration continues to object to the
moratorium on energy efficiency standards and to other riders. 
But the President's resolve to continue to oppose this attack on
conservation can be strengthened by hearing from states,
communities, utilities, and citizens who are concerned enough to
write, call, FAX, or E-mail the White House at this time.  You
can reach the White House by --
               
               letter:   The President
                         The White House
                         Washington, DC  20500

               phone:    (202)456-1111

               fax:      (202)456-2461

               e-mail:   president@whitehouse.gov  

Based on your own experience and concerns, let the Clinton
Administration know why the Appliance Standards Moratorium should
not be allowed to become law in any final budget compromise.  You
can mention that --

     -  the appliance energy efficiency standards already
     adopted are expected to save consumers $132 billion over the
     period 1990 to 2030;

     -  the appliance energy efficiency standards already
     adopted will reduce national electricity usage by 3% by the
     year 2000, displacing the need for 31 large (500 MW) power
     plants and cutting the emissions of many pollutants
     resulting from the generation of electric power;

     -  the moratorium will delay a proposed new standard now
     ready to be issued for refrigerators and freezers, which
     itself will result in electricity savings of 23 billion 
     kWh/yr by 2015, equivalent to the power typically supplied
     by 8 large (500 MW) baseload power plants.
 
You may also want to thank the President for opposing this ill-
conceived proposal, and encourage him to "hang in there" over the
next few weeks of high pressure negotiations with Senator Dole
and Speaker Gingrich.  Key decisions will most likely be made
before the latest Continuing Resolution expires on Wednesday,
April 24.

With your help, this attack on a decade of progress in energy
efficiency may yet be turned back.

		The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board and S. 1271
</H3></CENTER><P>
	During this session of Congress, the nuclear industry has lobbied in 
favor of legislation to radically alter the nation's nuclear waste policy by 
mandating the construction of an "interim" storage facility for the nation's 
high-level nuclear waste at the Nevada Test Site (NTS).  The bills would 
designate NTS as the storage site before the completion of studies to 
determine whether nearby Yucca Mountain is a suitable site for a permanent 
repository.
<P>
	On March 20, 1996, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board issued a 
report entitled "Disposal and Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel -- Finding the 
Right Balance."  The Review Board is a nonpartisan oversight body established 
by Congress under the current Nuclear Waste Policy Act to provide 
independent evaluation of the nation's high-level waste program.  Many of the 
Board's observations and conclusions contrast with the policies found in S. 
1271, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996, which is currently pending before 
the Senate.
<P>
<STRONG>
<CENTER>
Do we need a centralized interim storage facility now?
</CENTER>
<P>
NWTRB</STRONG>
<P>
"There are no compelling technical reasons for moving commercial spent fuel 
to a centralized storage facility at this time." (p. 30)
<P>
"[T]he Board has concluded that it makes technical, management, and fiscal 
sense to await the decision on the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site for 
repository development before beginning development of a federal centralized 
storage facility." (p. 45)
<P>
<STRONG>
S. 1271</STRONG>
<P>
"The Secretary shall store spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive 
waste... at an interim storage facility... beginning not later than November 
30, 1999." (Sec. 101(b))
<P><STRONG><CENTER>
Are we ready to open a centralized storage facility?
</CENTER><P>
NWTRB</STRONG>
<P>
"The process of licensing and developing a large federal centralized storage 
facility and the transportation infrastructure that goes with it would take 
time.  Developing a transportation system will require the acquisition of 
sufficient numbers of trucks or rail cars and casks, the establishment of 
transportation routes, and the development of emergency preparedness plans at 
the affected state and local levels.  As a result, the federal government 
could not begin accepting spent fuel at a facility much before 2002, and 
then not in significant amounts." (p. 35)
<P><STRONG>
S. 1271</STRONG>
<P>
Transportation capacity is to be ready by November 30, 1999.  
(Sec. 202(a)(b))  6400 metric tons of irradiated fuel are to have been 
accepted by the end of 2002. (Sec. 407) 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>
Could designation of an interim storage site now prejudice repository studies?
</CENTER><P>
NWTRB</STRONG>
<P>
"Deciding now to develop a storage facility at or near Yucca Mountain, prior 
to a decision about the suitability of that site for repository development, 
could undermine seriously the credibility of the process established by 
Congress.  Institutional momentum to develop a repository there could 
increase by creating the perception that the suitability of the site has 
already been determined." (p. 28)
<P>
"Developing a storage facility at the NTS now could prejudice the later 
decision about the suitability of Yucca Mountain for repository 
development." (p. 41)
<P><STRONG>
S. 1271</STRONG>
<P>
Designates the Nevada Test Site as the site for the interim facility, which 
overrides a prohibition in current law against placing interim storage in 
the state of Nevada. 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>
If we open a central facility, how big should it be?</CENTER>
<P>
NWTRB</STRONG>
<P>
"The Board also recommends developing storage incrementally by limiting the 
amount that can be transported to Yucca Mountain until the repository has 
been licensed for construction." (p. 45)
<P><STRONG>
S. 1271</STRONG>
<P>
A license application authorizing storage capacity of 100,000 metric tons 
must be submitted within 30 months of passage. (Sec. 204(c)(3))  This 
capacity exceeds the amount of civilian irradiated fuel expected by the year 
2030.
<P><STRONG><CENTER>
Could an interim site become a de facto permanent repository?</CENTER>
<P>
NWTRB</STRONG>
<P>
"Requiring the DOE to develop and operate a centralized storage facility now 
could adversely affect the progress and credibility of the nation's disposal 
efforts." (p. 30)
<P>
"As in the past, much opposition will result from concern that a proposed 
storage site could become a de facto disposal site." (p. 35)
<P>
"Assigning the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management any 
significant new activities at this time could compete for funding and other 
resources with site-characterization and repository development efforts at 
the Yucca Mountain site." (p. 47)
<P><STRONG>
S. 1271 </STRONG>
<P>
Eliminates the linkage between repository licensing and interim storage 
construction that is in current law.  Grants interim storage the highest 
budgetary priority. (Sec. 304(A))
<P><STRONG><CENTER>
Is shipping waste before the existence of a final destination wise?</CENTER>
<P>
NWTRB</STRONG>
<P>
"In a radioactive waste management system, one should strive to minimize the 
number of times spent fuel is handled.  Ideally, leaving it at its source 
until shipment for disposal would be the most efficient approach to spent 
fuel management." (p. 24)
<P><STRONG>
S. 1271</STRONG>
<P>
Mandates transport to the "interim" facility before a disposal capacity exists.
<P><STRONG><CENTER>
How should a centralized storage facility be financed?</CENTER>
<P>
NWTRB</STRONG>
<P>
"Given current funding projections, it appears that the Nuclear Waste Fund 
will only be marginally capable, at best, of supporting the long-term 
development and operation of a repository for the permanent disposal of 
spent fuel.  Therefore, the costs of a limited federal storage facility 
could be recovered through a new fee assessed on the users of that facility.  
The costs of a large storage facility located at a repository site (which 
would be used for all spent fuel) could be recovered by increasing the 
current 1 mill-per-kwh fee going into the Nuclear Waste Fund.  This would 
avoid having the taxpayer bear the costs of final closure of the 
repository." (p. 46)
<P><STRONG>
S. 1271</STRONG>
<P>
Designates the waste fund as the source of financing for interim storage, but 
holds the waste fund fee at its current level. (Sec. 301)
<P><STRONG><CENTER> 
Is the Nuclear Waste Fund adequate?</CENTER>
<P>
NWTRB</STRONG>
<P>
"[A]nalysts who conducted an independent financial and management review of 
the Yucca Mountain project suggested that the Nuclear Waste Fund as currently 
projected would be deficient by $3 to $5 billion." (p. 21)
<P><STRONG>
S. 1271</STRONG>
<P>
Fixes the fee at its current 1.0 mill/kwh, but contains no provisions for 
the fee's automatic adjustment to ensure full cost recovery.
<P><STRONG><CENTER>
Should the program employ rigid timetables?</CENTER>
<P>
NWTRB</STRONG>
<P>
"[A]ny long-term strategy and schedule should take the likelihood of 
surprises into account.  Unanticipated technical questions could crop up 
during licensing, and it could take some time to resolve them in a 
scientifically and technical credible fashion...Therefore, the repository 
start date cannot be set with precision." (p. 24-5)
<P><STRONG>
S. 1271</STRONG>
<P>
"No later than December 31, 2001, the Secretary shall apply to the 
Commission [NRC] for authorization to construct a repository." 
(Sec. 205(a)(3)) 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>
How should repository site suitability be determined?</CENTER>
<P>
NWTRB</STRONG>
<P>
"[T]he bases for judging site suitability should be established and 
available in advance of the decision." (p. 30)
<P><STRONG>
S. 1271</STRONG>
<P>
Revokes existing guidelines in federal regulations.  "The Secretary shall 
modify or eliminate those site characterization activities designed only to 
demonstrate the suitability of the site under the guidelines." 
(Sec 205(a)(1-2))
<P><STRONG><CENTER>
Is having only one storage site an equitable policy?</CENTER>
<P>
NWTRB</STRONG>
<P>
"The most geographically equitable approach to storage is to leave the spent

generated.  Developing several small regional storage facilities would 
achieve some moderate degree of geographic equity.  A single, large 
centralized facility offers the least geographic equity." (p. 34)

DOE RELEASES BUDGET REQUEST FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997<BR>
BUDGET CALLS FOR INCREASES TO RENEWABLES, EFFICIENCY<BR>
CONTINUES SPENDING ON FISSION, FUSION, AND PYROPROCESSING<BR>
<P>
The Department of Energy today released its budget request for
fiscal year 1997.  The request includes significant increases for
developing renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies
that would put spending on par with 1995 levels.  Unfortunately,
the budget request also includes additional spending on a number
of wasteful programs in nuclear fission and fails to keep the
fusion energy program in check.
<P>
DOE's budget now goes to Congress where it will be considered by
Appropriators as they prepare spending bills for FY'97.  The
House Energy & Water Appropriations Subcommittee (covers
renewables, nuclear power and fusion) is scheduled to mark up a
bill in late April or May.  Senate Appropriations will likely
move slower.  The Interior Appropriations bill (covers fossil
energy and energy efficiency) will be more problematic.  The
FY'96 spending bill stalled over negotiations with the President
over a number of controversial program areas, one of which was
energy efficiency.  As a result, funding for efficiency and
fossil has occurred through the various continuing resolutions
passed to prevent the government from shutdown.
<P><PRE>
The numbers announced today are as follows:

PROGRAM             FY'95     FY'96      FY'97     CHANGE

(+157.5%), wind (+57.4%), biofuels (+50.7%) and  photovoltaics
(+41.3%).  Smaller increases were allocated to geothermal (+6.6%)
and electric energy systems & storage (+5.2%).  Areas to be
reduced include solar thermal (-2.1%), resource assessment (-
100%) and hydrogen (-24.1%).  If approved, this budget would be
the second highest since 1983 (surpassed only in 1995).
<P>
ENERGY EFFICIENCY<BR>
All areas of energy efficiency are slated for increases in FY'97,
with the largest going to: federal energy management (+72.2%),
building technologies (+60.8%), industrial programs (+37.9%) and
transportation (+25.3%).  State grants, slashed in FY'96, got a
40.8% increase, though they would still be far below 1995 levels. 
If approved, this budget would be the second highest since 1981
(surpassed only in 1995).
<P>
NUCLEAR FISSION<BR>
Funding for the Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) Program,
attacked by consumer, taxpayer and environmental groups as
textbook corporate welfare, is set at $40 million for FY'97.  
DOE now claims that ALWR support, which provides money to General
Electric, Westinghouse, and Asea Brown Boveri, will continue
through at least FY'98 and probably until FY'99.  
<P>
Pyroprocessing, or "electrometallurgical refining" of spent
nuclear fuel at Argonne-West in Idaho, is listed at $30 million
(up $5 million from FY'96).  In adddition, at least $20 million
of $72 million dedicated to termination of the Advanced Liquid
Metal Reactor will be used for pyroprocessing, bringing the total
to $50 million.
<P>
NUCLEAR FUSION<BR>
Cuts to fusion in FY'96 have forced DOE to refocus the program
and terminate the proposed Tokamak Physics Experiment.  Increases
in FY'97 would be used to continue participation in the
International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER)($55
million), a consortium with Russia, Japan and the European
Community.  However, the budget states that the US will not seek
to host the construction of ITER due to the additional expense
involved.  Ongoing installation of over $50 million of new
equipment at Princeton and General Atomics will continue in
FY'97. At a pre-release briefing for "stakeholders," DOE Deputy
Secretary Charles Curtis admitted that commercially viable fusion
is more than 45 years away.
<P>
RADIOACTIVE WASTE<BR>
The $400 million request would come equally from the Nuclear
Waste Fund and from general taxpayer revenues. DOE will focus on
determining in 1998 the viability of Yucca Mountain as a
permanent repository, with a license application planned for 2002
if Congress approves the site. Generic work on interim storage
could be done if authorizing legislation passes.

                     "WHY KEEP FUNDING NUCLEAR PORK?"
                        STATEMENT OF BILL MAGAVERN
          DIRECTOR, PUBLIC CITIZEN'S CRITICAL MASS ENERGY PROJECT
               ON DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S 1997 BUDGET REQUEST

     "The Department of Energy's budget request for fiscal year
1997 combines an admirable commitment to the energy efficiency
and renewable energy technologies of the future with a
bewildering attachment to the nuclear pork projects of yesterday.

     At a time when its budget has been slashed and its very
existence criticized, the DOE continues to seek funding for
dangerous and expensive nuclear subsidies that benefit only a few
special interests. The Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR)
program is a textbook example of corporate welfare in which
taxpayers subsidize the regulatory fees of huge multinational
corporations like General Electric, Westinghouse and Asea Brown
Boveri. These reactor manufacturers are using federal dollars to
promote construction of new nuclear power plants which have no
domestic market and which, if built, would be as unsafe and
uneconomical as the existing reactors.

     DOE continues promoting another piece of radioactive pork in
its plans for pyroprocessing, or "electrometallurgical treatment
of spent fuel." This plutonium reprocessing technology grew out
of DOE's ill-fated breeder reactor program, but hangs on as a way
to placate politicians in Illinois and Idaho. Pyroprocessing
would create additional hazardous wastes and raise significant
proliferation risks.

     While its overall budget is going down, DOE unwisely fights
to increase funding for nuclear fusion, a technology that is at
least 45 years away from commercial viability. While the U.S.
should continue to fund some fusion research, investing in big
projects like the International Thermonuclear Experimental
Reactor (ITER) or in domestic tokamaks that generate large
quantities of radioactive waste is counterproductive.

     All three of these spending programs have been targetted as
wasteful and environmentally harmful by the "Green Scissors"
coalition of environmental and taxpayer groups. Congress should
terminate the ALWR and pyroprocessing boondoggles, and cut back
on fusion funding, using the savings for efficiency, renewables
and deficit reduction."

PRODUCT LIABILITY BILL WOULD CREATE HUGE LOOPHOLE FOR NUCLEAR REACTORS
<P>
On Thursday, March 14, a House-Senate conference committee
reached agreement on legislation to limit the rights of those
injured by unsafe products. Nuclear reactors and their components
are among the dangerous products covered by the bill, which is
part of the Republican "Contract on America." 
<P>
The product liability bill is opposed by a broad coalition of
citizens groups, including Public Citizen, Consumers Union, AFL-
CIO, Sierra Club, National Organization for Women, Gray Panthers,
Citizen Action, National Farmers Union, Consumer Federation of
America, and National Hispanic Council on Aging.
<P>
President Clinton also opposes the bill, and announced on
Saturday that he will veto it if Congress passes it.
<P>
Congressional passage is still in doubt, though, as Sen. Hollings
(D-SC) is leading a filibuster against the conference report. The
vote on cloture to end debate could come as early as tomorrow
(Tuesday). The bill's supporters, including Sens. Bob Dole (R-
KS), Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), and Slade Gorton (R-WA), will try
repeatedly, if necessary, to get the 60 votes they need to stop
the filibuster and approve the bill.
<P>
WHAT YOU CAN DO
Call or email both your senators and urge opposition to the
conference report on product liability. Also, write or email
thanks to President Clinton for opposing the bill.

                    U.S. PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP

          PRODUCT LIABILITY BILL COULD JEOPARDIZE NUCLEAR SAFETY


March 18, 1996


Dear Senator: 

     As organizations concerned with nuclear safety, we oppose
passage of the conference report on the Product Liability
Fairness Act. Among its other provisions, the bill would let off
the hook the manufacturers of dangerous nuclear reactors and
their components.

     The conference report's statute of repose would bar product
liability actions concerning durable goods alleged to have caused
harm more than 15 years after the time of delivery of the
product. Nuclear reactors and their components fit within the
definition of a durable good: any product, or any component of
any such product, which has a normal life expectancy of 3 or more
years or is of a character subject to allowance for depreciation
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or which is used in a
trade or business. The Senate bill had set the statute of repose
at 20 years, but the conference report shortens it to 15 years.

     By a straightforward  reading of this provision, victims of
nuclear accidents caused by defective nuclear reactors or
components delivered more than 20 years before the accident would
be barred from using product liability claims to seek
compensation for their injuries. As the Chernobyl catastrophe
demonstrates, a nuclear accident can injure hundreds of thousands
of people and cause billions of dollars worth of damage. The
Ukrainian government now estimates that Chernobyl has caused
125,000 deaths. While the U.S. nuclear industry claims that "it
can't happen here," that is no reason to relieve manufacturers of
responsibility for their products. 

     Defective nuclear reactors are far from an abstract problem.
To date, at least 14 electric utilities have sued Westinghouse
over serious problems with steam generators in its pressurized
water reactors.  Ruptured steam generator tubes could cause a
loss of coolant accident resulting in a meltdown of the
radioactive fuel.

     As nuclear reactors age, their safety problems increase. Yet
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission now allows extension of
operating licenses for 20 years beyond the current 40-year terms.
Manufacturers' liability for the reactors and their components
should continue until the reactors are shut down and dismantled.
A statute of repose would rob both electric utilities that
purchase reactors and workers and residents harmed by them of the
opportunity to exercise their legal rights to fair compensation.
Furthermore, imposition of a federal time limit on product
liability actions would remove an important deterrent to the
manufacture of unsafe reactors and components. Finally, if  tort
law is not allowed to hold manufacturers of defective nuclear
products accountable for a major nuclear accident, the victims'
costs may well be shifted to the taxpayers. 

                    Sincerely,

Michael Mariotte

Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Passes Interim
Storage, Ward Valley Bills; Ward Valley to Hit Senate Floor as
Early as Next Wednesday

On Wednesday the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee
passed both S. 1271, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996, and S.
1596, the Ward Valley Land Transfer Act.

Ward Valley

S. 1596 was passed by a voice vote and could be voted on by the
full Senate as early as next Wednesday.  Calls are needed to
Senators now in opposition to this anti-environment bill.

-- Tritium testing, recommended by a National Academy of Sciences
panel, is needed to determine whether radioactive wastes dumped
at Ward Valley would leak into the water table and into the
Colorado River, a source of drinking water for millions of
people;
   
-- U.S. Ecology, the dump contractor, should clearly not be
allowed to operate a radioactive waste facility. The company
admits to engaging in illegal dumping at its Nevada site, and has
also left behind heavily contaminated waste dumps at Sheffield,
Illinois, and Maxey Flats, Kentucky;
   
-- As a steward of federal land, the U.S. government should not
give California a site for radioactive waste without conducting a
planned supplemental environmental impact statement covering all
threats to public health and safety, in addition to the impacts
on Native American tribes.

The Capitol Switchboard number is (202)224-3121.  Direct line
numbers and email addresses for committee members can be found on
Critical Mass' voting index (http://www.essential.org/CMEP).


S. 1271

The committee passed S. 1271 on a 12-6 vote.  All of the
committee's Republicans and Senator Howell Heflin voted in favor,
while Senators Daniel Akaka (D-HI), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Dale
Bumpers (D-AR), Byron Dorgan (D-ND), Wendell Ford (D-KY), and
Paul Wellstone (D-MN) opposed the measure.  Senator Bill Bradley
(D-NJ) passed as did Bennett Johnston (D-LA), who was upset over
the committee's rejection of an amendment he offered to make S.
1271 more politically palatable.

Senator Wellstone offered amendments designed to lessen the
liability risk S. 1271 poses to the taxpayer, ensure the adequacy
of the nuclear waste fund, and prevent the construction of new
nuclear reactors without disposal capacity for their irradiated
fuel.  None of the amendments were approved. 

Senator Bumpers tried and failed to strip language from the bill
that would open the door to renewed reprocessing of irradiated
fuel.  The clause allows utilities to send their waste to
"qualified entities" who would "package, ship, and receive a
contract holder's spent nuclear fuel for interim storage and
conditioning."  After the fuel and any high-level reprocessing
wastes are packaged, the materials would become title of the
taxpayer.

The White House has assured Nevada senators Bryan and Reid that
President Clinton opposes the bill, which has not been scheduled
for the Senate floor.

For a list of how committee members voted on each amendment, send
an email to Michael Grynberg (grynberg@citizen.org).

Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Celebrates "Hug a
Nuclear Lobbyist Day;" Passes Legislation to Slash Standards,
Force Nuclear Dumps

     The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a
party for the nuclear industry today, passing legislation to
slash environmental standards and force the opening of nuclear
waste dumps in Nevada and California before the completion of key
scientific studies.  

     "Today the committee celebrated 'Hug a Nuclear Lobbyist
Day,'" Michael Grynberg, Energy Policy Analyst with Public
Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project, said.  "Their votes
represent another display of the callous disregard for the
environment for which the 104th Congress is justly notorious."

     The Committee passed S. 1271, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act
of 1996, as a substitute bill offered by original sponsor Larry
Craig (R-ID) and committee Chairman Frank Murkowski (R-AK).  
Like its earlier incarnation, the bill slashes environmental
standards and designates the Nevada Test Site as the site of an
"interim" nuclear waste dump before studies are completed of
nearby Yucca Mountain's suitability as a permanent repository for
high-level nuclear waste.  S. 1271 would override current law
that protects the integrity of ongoing studies by prohibiting
interim storage construction in Nevada.

     S. 1271 would also prohibit the Environmental Protection
Agency from issuing regulations to protect the public from
radiation releases from a repository, carve holes in the National
Environmental Policy Act, open the door to renewed reprocessing
of irradiated fuel, and set a repository radiation release
standard that poses a lifetime risk of one cancer death for every
286 exposed individuals.

     "Once again, members of the committee have shown that when
it comes to protecting the public from environmental hazards,
they still just don't get it," Bill Magavern, Director of
Critical Mass, said.  "Voters don't want the EPA to look the
other way when the nuclear industry takes the reins of the
nation's nuclear waste policy."

     Worst of all, Magavern added, is the fact that there is
currently no safety reason for centralized storage, as the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission has concluded that irradiated
reactor fuel can be stored at reactors for 100 years. 
Centralization would not reduce the number of high-level waste
sites, as every operating reactor is a de facto waste site so
long as it splits atoms.  Shipping waste to an unnecessary
"interim" facility, from which it would likely have to be shipped
again, only exposes citizens to the risks of radioactive waste
transportation. 

     If a nuclear dump opens in Nevada, transportation of nuclear
waste would proceed on a scale unprecedented in human history. 
Over 95 percent of the nation's waste radioactivity would be
shipped, affecting 43 states.  Many of these trips would be quite
long, as most of the nation's commercial nuclear reactors are
east of the Mississippi River. 
 
     Serious safety concerns surround nuclear transportation. 
With a greater number of shipments, the likelihood of accidents
involving a cask of irradiated nuclear fuel increases.  Adequate
steps have not been taken to ensure cask integrity in the event
of such a mishap.  Cask safety standards fail to incorporate the
full range of trauma to which a container may be exposed in an
accident.  Furthermore, regulations do not even require
compliance testing on full-scale models.

     "If citizens are to accept the risks of nuclear waste
transportation, these risks must be in the service of a carefully
considered program designed with public safety, not the
convenience of utility executives, as the single top priority,"
Grynberg said.  "Now is not the time to make private liabilities
public property.  Until a real solution to the problem of nuclear
waste can be devised, irradiated fuel should remain the
responsibility of those who chose to generate it."   

     The committee also passed legislation that would pave the
way for a "low-level" radioactive waste dump at Ward Valley,
California.  S. 1596, sponsored by Murkowski and longtime nuclear
industry advocate J. Bennett Johnston (D-LA), would order the
transfer of the federal land for the proposed dump before
critical studies of the site can occur.  

     Because of concerns that Ward Valley waste could contaminate
the Colorado River with radioactive pollutants, the Clinton
Administration plans studies recommended by a National Academy of
Sciences (NAS) panel and a Supplemental Environmental Impact
Statement before transferring the land.  S. 1596 would short-
circuit the process by transferring the land once the pro-dump
California state government merely declares its intent to conduct
the NAS-recommended studies.  The bill would also exempt the
transfer from federal environmental and land laws.

     "The committee gave Bennett Johnston's campaign for a post-
Senate career with the nuclear industry a boost," Magavern said,
"but the people who drink from the Colorado River would probably
have preferred that committee members wrote a letter of reference
instead."

     The Ward Valley dump would be operated by U.S. Ecology, a
company that has admitted to engaging in illegal dumping at its
Nevada site, and has also left behind heavily contaminated waste
dumps at Sheffield, Illinois and Maxey Flats, Kentucky.

WATCHDOGS CALL SALEM NUCLEAR PLANT "AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN"
Call for Permanent Retirement of the Salem Nuclear Generating Station

	Three public interest watchdog groups, NJPIRG Citizen Lobby, the 
Nuclear Information and Resource Service, and Public Citizen's Critical Mass 
Energy Project, joined today in calling for the permanent closure of the Salem 
Nuclear Generating Station.  Public Service Electric and Gas (PSE&G), the 
utility that owns and operates the two reactors at Salem, has revealed that 
critical components of the generators at Salem are disintegrating, drastically 
increasing the chances of a radioactive release or, in the worst case, a core 
meltdown.  This discovery is the latest in a long series of problems at Salem, 
which resulted in PSE&G temporarily closing Salem 1 and Salem 2 in May and 
June of last year, respectively.      	

	"PSE&G should act now to put the Salem reactors to bed for good," said 
Rebecca Stanfield, Energy Advocate, NJPIRG Citizen Lobby and coordinator of 
the R.E.A.L. Energy Coalition which is supported by over 60 New Jersey 
environmental and consumer groups and businesses.  "PSE&G acted prudently 
in closing Salem last spring.  However, public safety and sound economic 
policy requires permanent retirement of both reactors," she continued.

	Over their lifetimes the two Salem reactors have operated only 58% of 
their intended operating time and have drawn three of the top seven fines 
ever levied by the NRC.  In the past three years alone Salem has experienced 
over 20 shut-downs and has incurred $2 million in fines.  However, the new 
revelation of deterioration within the plant has prompted increased concern 
from national nuclear safety experts.

	"The combination of the deteriorating material that fabricates the 
steam generators, inadequate inspections and accelerated cracking between 
inspections adds up to an accident waiting to happen," said Paul Gunter, 
Director of the Reactor Watchdog Project at the Nuclear Information and 
Resource Service.  "The cracking and corroding along nearly 350 miles of 
Salem's steam generator tubes is the most serious challenge that the utility 
has faced to date," he continued.

	Gunter explained that the tubes that carry hot radioactive water 
throughout the plant are made of material that eventually deteriorates after 
being exposed to radioactivity.  If these tubes were to rupture, radioactive 
steam would be released into the environment.  Multiple tubes rupturing 
would result in a dramatic loss of cooling water, which could lead to a core 
meltdown.  

	Identical problems in many U.S. nuclear power plants who, like Salem, 
were built by Westinghouse, have resulted in fourteen separate suits by 
utilities against Westinghouse.  In addition, three of those plants have been 
retired before the end of their operating licenses because the owners found 
that early retirement would be more economical than paying the high costs of 
repairing or replacing the deteriorating tubes.  Repairing the tubes would cost 
at least $40 million while replacing the generators would cost an estimated 
$500 million.  However, neither option is predicted to secure safe and 
economical operations at Salem.

	"Even if PSE&G replaced Salem's generators, the plant is not economical 
to operate compared with the costs of replacing Salem with other sources of 
power," said Matthew Freedman, Energy Policy Analyst with Public Citizen's 
Critical Mass Energy Project (CMEP).  CMEP is the energy policy arm of Pubic 
Citizen, a national consumer advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader.  "If 
PSE&G invests hundreds of millions of dollars into repairing or replacing the 
steam generators, utility stockholders will profit at the expense of New Jersey 
electric customers."

	According to a 1995 Public Citizen study, the operations and 
maintenance costs of Salem, not including fuel, were higher than the price of 
available replacement power in the region.  In addition to the huge costs of 
steam generator repairs or replacement, Salem is scheduled to run out of 
storage space for its spent nuclear fuel in 2002 and will be forced to pay for 
expensive radioactive waste storage in order to continue operating," continued 
Freedman.

	Salem has drawn criticism from federal legislators as well.  United 
States Senator Joseph Biden blames Salem's long-standing problems on lax 
regulatory oversight by the NRC, and has petitioned the General Accounting 
Office for an audit of the NRC's oversight of Salem.  "Despite [Salem's] 
checkered past, NRC repeatedly avoided taking aggressive action," stated 
Senator Biden in a letter to the Comptroller General.  "Thus I am interested in 
determining the extent to which human health and safety were placed in 
jeopardy by NRC's inaction."

	The groups are calling for immediate action by PSE&G and the state 
Board of Public Utilities to retire the Salem reactors permanently.  "Although 
Salem has been identified as a problem plant by federal regulators and 
legislators, state and national public interest groups, and even PSE&G itself, 
we have not yet heard a peep from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities 
(BPU)," stated Stanfield.  "The BPU can no longer ignore Salem.  It should 
begin immediate proceedings to retire this nuclear lemon," she continued.

	NJPIRG Citizen Lobby is a non-profit, nonpartisan consumer and 
environmental watchdog group.  The R.E.A.L. Energy Coalition consists of over 
60 groups who support a shift away from fossil fuels and nuclear power, 
toward renewable energy and energy efficiency.

INTERIOR ANNOUNCES ENVIRONMENTAL TESTS, REVIEW FOR WARD VALLEY
CONGRESS LIKELY TO MEDDLE AGAIN</STRONG>
<P>
In a major victory for the environment, Deputy Secretary of
Interior John Garamendi on February 15 announced two important
new studies at the proposed dump site for "low-level" radioactive
waste at Ward Valley, California. The site is on federal land
managed by the Bureau of Land Management, and California Governor
Pete Wilson has been pushing the federal government to transfer
the land to the state with no safety conditions. The transfer has
been strongly opposed by public interest groups, including Public
Citizen, because of overwhelming evidence that the dump would
threaten drinking water sources. The proposed dump has also drawn
opposition from Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and from Native
American tribes who have sacred sites nearby.
<P>
Garamendi announced that the Department of Interior (DOI) will
undertake two measures "to reaffirm the Clinton Administration's
commitment that the federal role in transferring this land to the
State of California is carried out in a manner consistent with
our responsibility to assure the public that their health and
safety concerns are adequately addressed." First, Interior has
asked the Department of Energy to oversee tritium testing at the
Ward Valley site, where previous tests showed rapid migration of
the radioactive material. The tests, which were recommended by a
National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel, will be conducted by
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Second, Garamendi ordered
a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement to address public
concerns raised since the initial Environmental Impact Statement
was completed five years ago, further examine recommendations
made by the NAS panel, and consider the effect of the proposed
transfer on Native American sacred sites. The public will be
given an additional opportunity to submit formal comment or
provide new information about the site, but the DOI will not be
holding the public hearings previously promised by Secretary
Bruce Babbitt.
<P>
The next move by Pete Wilson, U.S. Ecology and the nuclear
utilities that want to dump their wastes in shallow unlined
trenches at Ward Valley will be the same as their last move --
lobby Congress to force Interior to transfer the land. Congress
included a mandatory land transfer, exempted from all federal
laws, in the ill-fated budget reconciliation bill of 1995.
President Clinton vetoed that bill for 82 reasons, one of which
was Ward Valley. Sources report that industry lobbyists have
already begun planning a Congressional attack on Interior. Rep.
Brian Bilbray (R-CA) introduced last year a free-standing bill,
H.R.2334, to mandate a land transfer.
<P>
WHAT YOU CAN DO:
Write or email your Members of Congress, telling them to oppose
any transfer of federal land for use as a radioactive waste dump
at Ward Valley. Points to make include:
<P>
-- Tritium testing is needed to determine whether radioactive
wastes dumped at Ward Valley would leak into the water table and
into the Colorado River, a source of drinking water for millions
of people;
<P>
-- U.S. Ecology should clearly not be allowed to operate a
radioactive waste facility. The company admits to engaging in

TAXPAYER, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS TARGET 
47 FEDERAL PROGRAMS THAT WASTE $39 
BILLION AND HARM THE ENVIRONMENT
<P>
Green Scissors '96 Coalition Report Seeks to Sustain '95 Bipartisan Success;
Government Subsidies Squander Money, Cause Environmental 
Havoc</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- Aiming to build on bipartisan successes of 1995 in slashing
Federal programs and subsidies that waste billions while harming the
environment, the Green Scissors campaign of taxpayer and environmental
groups today released the Green Scissors '96 report. 
<P>
The 47 programs included in the report would save taxpayers $39 billion if
eliminated and include energy, public lands, water, agriculture, highway,
foreign aid and insurance programs.   The report cites the total cost and
environmental damage of each program and explains why it is a waste of
taxpayer money.  Targets range in scope from international projects like the
environmentally disastrous Three Gorges Dam in China to domestic programs
like the Federal peanut subsidy and  Federally-funded projects in 17 states
like an expensive -- and doomed -- beach restoration effort in New Jersey.  
<P>
Led by Friends of the Earth, Taxpayers for Common Sense and the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group, the Green Scissors campaign includes more than 20
other groups like the Concord Coalition, American Lung Association and
Sierra Club.  Today's report was also released by local groups in dozens of
states, many of whom are fighting unwanted federal projects in their backyards.
<P>
After the Green Scissors coalition released its widely heralded 1995 report,
a bipartisan alliance in Congress successfully cut unneeded programs that
will save taxpayers more than $5 billion.  Gone are sacred cows like the
Department of Energy's Gas Turbine-Modular Helium Reactor project -- a
nuclear research program that was rejected by the National Academy of
Sciences three times.  Republican Representatives Scott Klug (R-WI) and Mark
Foley (R-FL) united with Democrats Bill Luther (D-MN) and David Obey (D-WI)
led the successful fight to kill the program and save taxpayers $2.6
billion.  Also gone is the notorious Arun Dam in Nepal, a World Bank project
that would have inundated an isolated mountain valley and doomed one of the
last virgin forests in the Himalayas.
<P>
"Despite some progress on the budget, the danger of a relapse into gridlock
is very real," said Gawain Kripke, Director of the Appropriations Project at
Friends of the Earth.  "These wasteful and environmentally damaging programs
provide a perfect opportunity for both parties in Congress to work on real
cuts and maintain momentum toward the larger goal of balancing the budget."
<P>
"These are 47 real cuts that can be made right now.  Congress and the
President should stop talking and start cutting, " said Ralph De Gennaro of
Taxpayers for Common Sense.  "Green Scissors is a step in the right
direction toward cutting waste and balancing the budget."
<P>
"It's ridiculous that the federal government has been shut down over budget
fights, yet we're giving away platinum to Chevron, research programs to
General Electric and free advertising to the Pillsbury dough boy," said Anna
Aurillo, Staff Scientist for U.S. PIRG.
<P>
The report describes a timber sales program in Alaska's Tongass National
Forest that costs taxpayers $100 million; a massive flood control tunnel in
New Jersey that costs $1.5 billion and could be replaced by a much less
expensive alternative; and a $900 million clean coal program that subsidizes
the largest source of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.  A few of the
targeted programs in the 1996 report are holdovers from 1995, like the 1872
Mining Law, which loses billions for taxpayer through handouts to huge
mining interests.
<P>
Founded in 1969, Friends of the Earth U.S. works to protect the environment
and has affiliates in 52 countries.  Taxpayers for Common Sense was founded
in 1995 and works to cut wasteful spending, subsidies and tax breaks through
research and citizen education.  The U.S. Public Interest Research Group is
the national lobbying office for the state PIRGs.  The state PIRGs are
nonprofit, nonpartisan environmental and consumer watchdog groups active
across the country.

RADIOACTIVE WASTE: MOVING IT AROUND WILL NOT SOLVE THE

<BR>March 2, 1995 -- Public Citizen's testimony to the U.S.
Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on proposals to
amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  Public Citizen opposes
efforts to weaken environmental standards and force an
unnecessary nuclear waste dump upon the state of Nevada.  A dump
in Nevada would open the door to transportation of highly toxic
nuclear waste on an unprecedented scale.</LI>

Executive Summary
</STRONG>
</CENTER>
<P>
     This report represents the view of a majority of the Policy
Dialogue Advisory Committee to Assist in the Development of
Measures to Significantly Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions from
Personal Motor Vehicles.  President Clinton charged the Committee
with developing recommendations for three sets of policies that
would, if adopted, most cost-effectively return greenhouse gas
emissions from cars and light trucks to 1990 levels by the years
2005, 2015, and 2025, respectively, with no upturn thereafter.
<P>
     Essentially the Committee had two goals: to articulate,
evaluate and recommend a package of policies capable of returning
transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels,
and to develop consensus among a diverse membership.
<P>
The Committee at large was not able to reach a consensus.  This
majority report is submitted so that the President will be able
to take advantage of the considerable work done by the Committee
as the President crafts federal policies to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions.
<P>
     The Committee as a whole approached its work by examining
the three factors that determine greenhouse gas emissions from
personal motor vehicles: fuel economy, vehicle miles traveled
(VMT) and alternative fuels.  The Committee reached agreement on
a number of policies in the areas of reducing VMT and promoting
the use of alternative fuels, subject to their being included in
a balanced package that achieves the emission targets set by the 
President.  In addition, an analytical framework for evaluating
and scoring policies was accepted by all members for the purpose
of the Committee's work. Finally, there was widespread agreement
that the gap between emission reductions anticipated for the
agreed-upon policies and the targets in the Committee's charge
should be approached through some combination of increasing the
cost of driving (e.g. by a gas tax) and policies that directly 
increase fuel economy (e.g. by fuel economy standards supported
by feebates).
<P>
     The Committee could not reach consensus on a report because
it was unable to reconcile the following positions:
Environmentalists favored fuel economy standards, which the auto
industry opposed.  The automobile industry proposed gas taxes to
which the oil industry representatives objected. Finally, a
consensus report stating the Committee's disagreement was
unacceptable to the auto industry if it mentioned direct measures
to increase fuel economy in a quantified way.
<P>
     The Committee members signing this report believe that a
package cannot be complete and is unlikely to be cost-effective
or equitable without including direct policies for addressing
fuel economy and the cost of travel.  
<P>
     This report therefore recommends a balanced set of policies
that would:
<P>
     1)  reduce vehicle emissions by increasing the efficiency of
the vehicle fleet;<BR>
     2)  reduce emissions by introducing cleaner burning fuels;
and<BR>
3)  reduce driving by improving the attractiveness of
alternatives to driving, and by sending accurate price signals
about the cost of driving.
<P>
     In particular, we make the following recommendation (numbers
in parenthesis represent millions of metric tonnes of carbon
equivalent for 2005, 2015, and 2025 in the case that returns
emissions to 1990 levels by 2005):
<P>
<STRONG>
Recommended Policy Set<P>

FUEL ECONOMY MEASURES:<BR>
</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>increasing the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
Standards starting in 1998 to achieve 45 mpg and provide market
incentives plus research and development support.  This will
result in the most significant portion of the greenhouse gas
reductions (36, 117,175 MMT). 
<LI>introducing feebates for low rolling resistance tires (3,4,5
MMT).
<P>
</UL>
<STRONG>
ALTERNATIVE FUELS MEASURES:<BR>
</STRONG>
<LI>supporting the use of electric vehicles and further research
and development plus a tax credit (.4, 4.5, 9.9 MMT)
<LI>supporting natural gas vehicles and infrastructure (1.1, 5.5,
7.7 MMT)
<LI>supporting liquid biofuels research and development, in
particular ethanol produced from cellulosic biomass, providing
production incentives for low-emitting fuels (5.1, 38, 100 
MMT)</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED MEASURES:<BR>
</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>encouraging the equitable shift of state and local road
subsidies to cost-of-driving (VMT fees) (30, 32, 30 MMT)
<LI>encouraging land use changes away from auto dependency by
improving fixed-route and on-demand transit services plus bicycle
and pedestrian access (5.3, 13, 23 MMT).
<LI>reforming workplace parking subsidy programs (5.7, 11, 22
MMT).
<P>
The longer lead time available by 2015 permits a slower ramp-up
of fuel economy standards and a lower VMT fee.  Both the 2005 and
the 2015 policy packages provide an ongoing downward emissions
trend, so that either would suffice to meet the Committee's 
goal for 2025 as well.
<P>
          We favor adoption of policies having continuity over
time.  The relative importance, however, of the various policies
is different at different times.  For example, alternative fuels
are a relatively small contributor in 2005, but can become a
large contributor in 2015 and 2025 provided that aggressive and
sustained development efforts are initiated now.
<P>
          Meeting the Committee's charge will not be easy to
accomplish, but it will be necessary to meet the United States'
obligation under the Framework Convention on Climate Change
agreed to in Rio in 1992.  In addition to achieving reductions in
emissions from the transportation sector, we believe that these
recommendations will also reduce air pollution including urban
smog, save consumers money, create jobs and cut U.S. reliance on
imported oil.
<P>
     By signing this report members agree that this is a
compromise proposal that represents a viable way to meet the
President's goals.  Among those signing this report are 
those who would have preferred less stringent or more
market-based mechanisms and those who would have preferred
tougher purely regulatory approaches.  We recognize that in the 
interest of compromise, we have crafted this package.  We are all
joining together to submit this set of options that we all
believe can accomplish the President's goal, although any 
specific mechanism alone may not be one which an organization may
support.
<P>
     This is a critical time with respect to greenhouse gas
emissions.

<FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER I:  <A
NAME="introduction">INTRODUCTION</A></FONT>
</STRONG>
</CENTER>
Much of the anticipated growth in greenhouse gas emissions after
2000 will be in the transportation sector.  Even with actions
taken under this plan, we expect that overall use of automobiles
and trucks will increase as vehicles are driven greater
distances.  In order to continue emission reduction trends beyond
the turn of the century, additional cost-effective measures will
be needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of individual
vehicles and to increase America's transportation options, so
that personal mobility can be enhanced while private vehicles
can be driven less.<A HREF="#note1">[1]</A>
<P>
     In September, 1994, President Clinton convened a Federal
Advisory Committee Policy Dialogue to assist in the development
of measures to significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions from personal motor vehicles.  The charge to
the Advisory Committee was to develop three sets of policies that
would, if adopted, most cost-effectively return greenhouse gas
emissions from cars and light trucks to 1990 levels by the years
2005, 2015, and 2025, respectively, with no upturn thereafter. 
The President gave the Committee this ambitious charge with full
knowledge that the debate over how the US should respond to the 
threat of global climate change, particularly in the
transportation sector, had stalled numerous times in recent
years. 
<P>
     Over the course of one year, members of the Policy Dialogue
Advisory Committee met eleven times to discuss how to return
greenhouse gas emissions from light duty vehicles to 1990 levels
in each of the three target years in the most cost-effective
manner.  These members recognize that achieving the goal is not
easy.  Yet, the work of the full Committee has demonstrated that,
while addressing reduction of GHG emissions from the transport 
sector is difficult, there are sets of feasible and
cost-effective alternatives to return GHG emissions from light
duty vehicles to 1990 levels in each of the three target years -
2005, 2015 and 2025.  In response to its charge, this group of
Committee members has developed a blueprint for how to achieve
the President's goals and as an "insurance plan" that could be 
used to address climate change in the future.
<P>
<STRONG>The Policy Dialogue Advisory Committee
</STRONG>
<P>
     When President Clinton appointed the thirty members of the
Policy Dialogue Advisory Committee, he and his staff sought
representatives of state, local and regional government agencies,
automobile manufacturers and related parties like suppliers and
insurers, the transportation fuels industry, labor, and public
interest groups who could constructively address the Committee's
charge. Over 170 individuals were nominated by various groups for
appointment to the committee.  The President appointed
individuals who met the following qualifications:<P>
<UL>
<LI>knowledge of and familiarity with the range of issues to be
addressed by the Committee; 
<LI>leadership experience within his or her constituency;
<LI>willingness and ability to participate in the Advisory
Committee, including technical 
and administrative support to do so;
<LI>ability to be constructive and to take a creative approach,
including willingness to 
move beyond past positions; and

<STRONG><A NAME="IA">A. Overview of the Policy Dialogue Advisory
Committee Process</A></STRONG>
<P>
     At its first meeting, several elements of the Committee's
functioning were determined.  The Committee discussed and agreed
on procedural groundrules, including a provision that it would
make decisions by consensus, defined as all can live with the
decision made.  
<P>
     Also early on, the Committee began its interaction with the
Analytic Support Group (ASG), comprised of government technical
experts, who, at the Committee's request, provided information
about the extent of the climate change problem and the
contribution of the personal transportation sector to total CO2
emissions.  The ASG provided the Committee with considerable
assistance over its year of deliberations, including running
analyses on the baseline computer model that allowed calculations
of the greenhouse gas emission reductions from specific policies
and sets of policies.
<P>
The Committee undertook the following tasks as it addressed its
charge:
<P>
*analyzing and developing agreements about the underlying
assumptions that were used as inputs to the model that estimated
the baseline for CO 2 emissions;<BR> 
*obtaining briefings from experts on fuel economy technology, the
Partnership for a New Generation Vehicle, members of the National
Research Council Committee on potential fuel economy
improvements, experts on alternative fuels and their relative
greenhouse gas emissions, on current generation electric
vehicles, and demographic and transportation planning experts on
driving behaviors and patterns;<BR> 
*visiting California's South Coast Air Quality Management
District and the city of Pasadena, where the focus was on
alternative fuel vehicles, reducing single-occupant-
vehicle driving, and land use planning that incorporates
transportation demand management;<BR>
*commissioning of three ad-hoc policy groups of Committee members
to develop recommendations to the plenary group on three areas:
1) policies for improving fuel economy, 2) policies to introduce
and support low greenhouse gas fuels, and 3)policies to reduce
vehicle miles of travel (VMT);<BR>
*developing a consensus set of evaluation criteria for over 65
potential policies;<BR>
*preparing a proposal and analysis, with the Analytic Support
Group, of many potential policies; and<BR>
*seeking agreement on a set of general recommendations and
acceptable policy sets that could, if adopted, return CO 2
emissions from personal motor vehicles to 1990 levels by 2005,
2015 and 2025.
<P>
     While the majority submitting this report agree on a set of
options for achieving the President's goals for reducing CO 2
emissions from personal motor vehicles, some Committee 
members disagreed about including fuel economy standards as a
strategy.  There was consensus within the Committee on a partial
set of policies, however these policies missed achieving the
President's goals by a significant margin.  Some other ideas
which were discussed, in the end were not recommended because
their costs were considered either too high or too
disproportionally distributed, therefore, making them
infeasible.
<P>

     The Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) for 1995 identified 1990
carbon emissions from the transportation sector at 32.3% of total
carbon emissions, and projected an increase of 27% by 2010 (See
table below).  Within the transportation sector, 1990 emissions
from light duty vehicles were 53.1% of total energy use, with all
but 18% of that in the personal transportation category.  Thus,
reducing carbon emissions from the transportation sector could
make a significant contribution to reducing greenhouse gases
during the first quarter of the next century.

<P>
Total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from personal transportation
are completely determined by three factors: 
<P>
*    total vehicle miles traveled (VMT),<BR>
*    the rate of fuel use for each of these miles (fuel economy,
or MPG), and<BR>
*    the GHG content of the fuels used, which depends, in turn,
on the rate of utilization of non-carbon-based alternative fuels
and vehicles (AF's, AFVs). 
<P>
     To develop a plausible unrestrained path for future GHG
emissions from personal transportation, it was necessary to
specify trends for each of these components.  From the 
calculation of these trends it was possible to develop estimates
of reductions in GHG emissions from personal motor vehicles
needed to bring emissions back to 1990 levels.
<P>
     Developing trends for growth VMT, MPG, and AFs and AFVs
required judgments about a variety of other influences.  For
example, the rate of growth of VMT will depend on 
future income growth, changes in the fuel and other costs of
driving, growth or leveling off of female labor force
participation, mobility of retirees, changes in land use and
availability of other modes.  Fuel economy trends depend on fuel
prices, changes in consumer preferences for vehicle attributes,
changes in costs of supplying fuel economy technology, and other 
factors potentially affecting vehicle turnover (e.g., the
performance of vehicle I&M programs).  The use of AFs and AFVs
depends on the degree of success in developing technological
options with competitive costs and performance characteristics,
the time needed to develop necessary infrastructure, and the GHG
characteristics of the fuel and vehicle technologies.
<P>
     The Analytic Support Group (ASG) of the interagency Steering
Committee developed information used by the Committee to specify
a plausible unrestrained path for GHG emissions - the baseline -
and an accounting model to compare the amount of greenhouse gas 
reductions that would result from any specific policy against the
baseline. The Analytic Support Group used existing estimates in
the literature as inputs to the baseline.  The Policy 
Dialogue Advisory Committee reviewed the ASG assumptions and
refined several parameters.  For fuel economy predictions, the
Committee agreed to construct the baseline under the assumption
of both moderately increasing and constant (real) oil prices over
the next 30 years.  For predictions about the use of alternative
fuels, alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) were assumed to rise to a
3% market penetration by 2025, consistent with current regulatory
mandates for fleet use.
<P>
     To model VMT trends, the ASG relied in part on an
econometric model developed at the Volpe Transportation Center
that can predict growth in VMT given assumptions about 
growth in population, income, and demographic factors.  The ASG
also surveyed the available literature on VMT growth and its
causes, and together with a subcommittee of the Advisory
Committee, backtested the model for the period 1980 to
1990.  After considerable analysis and debate the Committee
elected to set a baseline VMT growth rate of 2% per year 
to 2005, and then to use the prediction from the Volpe model
(expected to be 1.7% annually)through 2025.
<P>
     The other crucial set of assumptions the Committee needed
involved predicting and estimating the response of VMT and MPG to
changes in the cost of fuel or in the total cost of 
driving.  After much debate and examination of the literature,
the Committee developed a set of elasticities that were agreed
upon only for the specific purpose of the Committee's work.  
They included:
<P>
*The elasticity of demand for new car fuel economy in response to
fuel prices should be 0.4.
<P>
*The VMT elasticity with respect to fuel price should be .21 and
VMT elasticity with respect to the fuel cost per mile should be
.35.**  The Committee recognized that these elasticities,
particularly VMT with respect to fuel cost per mile
(the so-called rebound effect) could be inaccurate and agreed to
do sensitivity analyses to reflect differing estimates.
<P>
*To reflect the uncertainties of market responses to price
increases, the Committee decided to build into the model
assumptions of a threshold of $.25 fuel price increase before the
full fuel economy elasticity is in effect.  During the period
before full elasticity effect, the Committee decided to build in
an elasticity factor of .25.
<P>
     These agreed upon assumptions and projections were critical
to the Committee deliberations and to analysis of policy impacts. 
The baseline calculations are referred to repeatedly throughout
this report.  For analytical purposes, the constant oil price
projection was the usual assumption used.
<P>
**This elasticity tends to fall into the middle of a wide range
of estimates derived from a number of methodologies for a longer-
term response.  The Committee did not specifically address the
applicability of this elasticity to a shorter time frame,
including its utility for the 2005 timeframe.

     Determining what policies to recommend for what target years
required the Committee to understand the technological
achievements that were possible, as well as the 
long-term time horizon for behavioral and demographic changes. 
The policy sets presented in Chapter 2 are based on some of the
following projections of changes that are possible, in 
the Committee's view, over the next 30 years.

BY THE YEAR 2005, we will see:

<STRONG>Alternative Fuels and Vehicles
</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Alternative fuels and vehicles will be part of the car-buying
picture.
<LI>Electric vehicles are standardly used in niche markets and in
urban areas.  Continuous improvements in the performance, range,
and recharge time of battery-powered electric vehicles will have
resulted from Zero Emission Vehicle mandates in California, 
Massachusetts, and New York, and from other Clean Air Act
requirements.
<LI>Natural gas and liquid propane gas will increasingly be used
for public and private fleets, especially in areas with Clean Air
Act mandates.  Natural gas powered vans and light trucks will be
widely available on the personal motor vehicle market.
<LI>Technology to improve the production of ethanol from
cellulosic biomass may be improved to produce a shorter
fermentation process, setting the stage for cellulosic 
ethanol to replace corn-ethanol as a low-greenhouse-gas fuel.
<LI>Farmers will be growing biomass crops for ethanol production
on land formerly targeted for erosion prevention.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>
Fuel Economy Improvements
</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Conventional internal combustion engines fueled by gasoline
but with improved fuel efficiency will continue to be the
predominant choice for personal motor vehicles.
<LI>Increased CAFE standards will cause auto makers to introduce
new technology into motor vehicles to improve new car, van and
light truck fuel efficiency.
<LI>New technologies such as improved transmissions from 5-speed
automatics to continuously variable, lean burn engines, light
weight/high strength materials, and accessories with reduced
friction losses will become common place in the market.
<LI>Existing technologies such as multi-valve engines and
multi-port fuel injection which have significant penetration in
the passenger car market today will reach similar market 
penetration levels in light trucks and vans where they have
limited penetration today.
<LI>Incentive programs (like rebates, vehicle retirement, and
feebate programs) to induce consumers to purchase vehicles with
good fuel economy will be in place to help this market creation
along
<LI>Low-rolling resistance tires will be commonly sought by
consumers as lower cost in the long run, aided by incentive
programs like rebates and vouchers. 
<LI>The highly fuel efficient standard-size prototypes with up to
80-mpg fuel economy that result from the Partnership for a New
Generation Vehicles (PNGV) in 2003 will give impetus for even
more dramatic changes in future fuel economy beyond 2005.
<LI>Increased CAFE standards will cause the auto makers to
realize the PNGV goal of integrating technology developed from
the PNGV program into the new vehicle fleet as the technology is
developed.
<LI>VMT fees and feebates will work to increase consumer demand
for the more fuel efficient motor vehicles needed to meet
increased CAFE standards. 
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>
VMT Reduction
</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>An equitable shift of state and local road subsidies to
cost-of-driving fees will reduce the amount of miles traveled.
<LI>About 80% of cars driven to work are parked in free,
employer-provided parking, but a new Workplace Parking Subsidy
Reform gives employees the option to exchange the value of free
parking for taxable income.  This starts to make alternative
modes of commuting more attractive.
<LI>1995 proposals to create livable communities will begin to
bear fruit in development plans for suburbs and urban areas;
pricing strategies to discourage single-occupant-
vehicle use will be options in several large cities.  
<LI>Infill strategies to prevent deterioration of cities will be
commonly proposed in urban revitalization plans.
<LI>Mixed use developments with walkable and bikeable travel
patterns will be proposed, with pilot projects for smaller
communities well under way.
<LI>Reliable mass transit paired with affordable and reliable
on-demand transportation outside of urban cores will be accepted
increasingly by communities.  
<LI>CO2 emissions from residence-to-work travel will be reduced
by employer/employee designed programs to provide financial
incentives to those traveling to work in coordinated group travel
in vans and ride-share programs.
</UL>
<P> 
<STRONG>
BY THE YEAR 2015,</STRONG> many of the policy directions noted
above will be much further along.
<UL>
<P> 
<LI>CAFE standards will contribute the biggest reductions in
greenhouse gas emissions as turnover of the vehicle fleet subject
to tighter CAFE standards begun in 1998 model year and increased
thereafter takes effect.
<LI>Spurred by CAFE standards, feebates and "green machine
challenges", the PNGV vehicles introduced in 2003, or other
highly fuel-efficient vehicles, will have achieved a 
significant market share as high as 15%.
<LI>World oil prices may begin to rise due to increasing demand
on the oil supply, creating additional demand for higher fuel
economy vehicles and alternative fuels. 
<LI>VMT pricing mechanisms will be in place in almost half of the
major congested areas in the U.S. 
<LI>Several leaders will have emerged in the competition to
produce the most reliable and cost-effective alternative fuels,
and the need for transition strategies, like incentives to 
fuel producers and consumers, may diminish.
<LI>Advanced technology vehicles may be in many fleets, including
those of car rental companies, and the groundwork and experience
will be there for consumer familiarity and demand for these
vehicles.  
<LI>Citizens may accept shared electric (or other alternatively
fueled) "town-cars" for transportation within congested cities. 
<LI>Livable communities will continue to be a goal, and some of
the innovative plans of 1990 and 2005 will begin to bear fruit,
as will road use and VMT pricing strategies, to reduce VMT.  
<LI>Alternatives to single occupancy travel will continue to
grow, with most improvement from the availability of on-demand
transit (taxi's, super shuttles, etc.) in non-urban areas.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>
IN 2025,</STRONG> many of the long term strategies for changing
the consumption of carbon in transportation may have run a full
cycle, with evident results:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>CAFE standards and alternate fuels will each contribute over
one-third of the net greenhouse gas emissions reductions achieved
begun in 1998 model year and increased thereafter takes effect.
<LI>Alternative fuels and vehicles could become competitive on a
life-cycle cost basis with gasoline and diesel vehicles.  
<LI>Very high mileage vehicles with the typical family sedan
getting up to 80-mpg and smaller vehicles getting over 100-mpg
will be common place; break through technologies such as hybrid
engines and implementation of known technologies such as direct 
injection will penetrate the market.
<LI>These vehicles will be sought by consumers as oil prices
increase globally, and as technology produces affordable
products.  
<LI>The technology to produce ethanol from cellulosic biomass may
be advanced to the point that it is a sustainable energy source
for the transportation sector.
<LI>U.S. manufacturers could build on research and development
earlier in the century to become leading exporters of new
alternative fuels technology.  
<LI>Half of the houses in existence in 2025 will have been
constructed after 1995.  If this new housing is developed
according to plans that emphasize alternative mobility options, 
VMT could decline.

<STRONG>
<A NAME="IIA">Policy Evaluation Process</A>
</STRONG>
<P>
     The Committee agreed on how it would use the criteria
specified in its charge from the President to evaluate various
policies for inclusion in final recommendations.  The 
Committee decided to define the policy options and do rough
estimate of GHG emission reductions available from each option. 
Based on the GHG reduction potential, the Committee then decided
which policy options to evaluate in greater detail and which
policy descriptions needed to be refined.
<P>
Next the Committee evaluated policy options on the following
criteria:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>amount of GHG reduction
<LI>costs and their distribution
<LI>cost effectiveness (costs of obtaining a specific GHG
emission reduction divided by the amount of the reduction)
<LI>time horizon for implementing the policy and realizing the
reductions
<LI>sustainability of reductions (i.e. no upturn thereafter), and
reliability (i.e. policy will produce projected reductions), 
<LI>other impacts including:<BR>
                    - safety<BR>
                    - other environmental effects<BR>
                    - social (including effects on mobility,
jobs, consumer requirements and satisfaction, intergenerational,
urban/suburban/rural, geography etc.) and their distribution<BR>
                    - other GHG reduction policy implications<BR>
<LI>feasibility of adoption
<LI>ease of implementation
</UL>
<P>
     In applying these evaluation criteria the Committee came to
several important 
conclusions.  They were:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>CO2 emission reduction efforts should be particularly
supported when they are achievable in the context of reaching
other important national objectives, like reducing air pollution
and improving the quality of life in congested communities.  
Efforts undertaken to address climate change impacts from
personal motor vehicles overlap significantly with efforts being
proposed or undertaken to address other national and local
challenges.  For example, alternative fuel vehicles are needed in
certain parts of the county to address air pollution problems;
these vehicles and fuels can also reduce CO2 emissions. 
Committee members realize the value of and agreed upon a goal of
specifically including greenhouse gas emission reduction goals in
efforts that will be underway for other reasons.
<P>
<LI>Policies recommended by the Committee must meet the criteria
set out in the President's charge.  The Committee took its charge
seriously and set about to find policies with the greatest
reliability, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility of adoption.  
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="IIB">
General Recommendations</A></STRONG>
<P>
     Two packages of policies are recommended by this report, one
for returning car and light truck greenhouse gas emissions to the
1990 level by 2005 and the other for achieving return by 2015. 
Both packages provide an ongoing downward emissions trend, so
that either would suffice to meet the Committee's goal for 2025
as well.  The following table lists the packages for 2005 showing
estimated emissions reductions in each of the three years 
specified for discussion (2005, 2015, 2025).  Policy descriptions
are given in the following sections of this report. The longer
lead time available by 2015 permits a slower ramp-up of 
fuel economy standards and a lower VMT fee.  In fact, the 2015
package reduces emissions to 24 MMT (7%) below the 1990 level - a
modest safety margin. The VMT fee was chosen so as to keep the
variable cost of driving constant as fuel economy increased
through fuel economy standards;  dispensing with the VMT fee
would still suffice to return emissions by 2015, but the safety
margin would be only 1%.  The 2005 package just meets the return 
requirements.  Results are shown relative to the flat oil price
baseline; a rising world oil price could make the targets easier
to achieve.
<P>
     The Committee approached its work in constructing packages
by examining the three major factors - vehicle miles traveled
(VMT), fuel economy, and fuel type (e.g., lower carbon 
content) - which determine greenhouse gas emissions in the
personal transportation sector.  The Committee members issuing
this report believe that a balanced approach to controlling 
car and light truck greenhouse gas emissions entails using a
variety of measures, affecting all of these three factors.  The
most difficult measures on which to achieve consensus were those 
for directly improving vehicle fuel economy (such as stronger
fuel economy standards) and those for directly increasing the
variable cost of driving (such as a gasoline tax or VMT fee).  
The members issuing this report acknowledge that Committee
members from the directly affected industries objected to such
policies during the Committee discussions.  However, we 
feel that a package cannot be complete and is unlikely to be
cost-effective or equitable without including direct policies for
addressing fuel economy and the cost of travel.
<P>
     Most policies can vary in their degree of stringency.  For
example, a gasoline tax could, in principle, extend much higher
than current U.S. levels (European levels range up to 
$3 per gallon).  Similarly, VMT fees could span a range: a 0.5
per mile fee would increase the cost of driving by just under
10%, whereas a 6 per mile fee would double it.  Fuel 
economy standards could be set at various levels, as could
subsidies for various alternative fuels.  Given the uncertainties
(and sometimes serious disputes) about the emissions reductions,
costs and benefits, and distributional effects of any given
policy, the members issuing this report felt that a balanced
package should not rely solely on a more stringent version of a
single policy when a less stringent version would suffice if
combined with other policies.  Thus, while in theory, emissions
could be returned by a sufficiently high gasoline 
or carbon tax alone, we do not believe that such an approach
would be cost - effective, equitable, or even reliable (let alone
politically realistic).  There are no "silver bullets" for 
meeting the challenge of controlling greenhouse gas emissions.  A
package is more robust if it includes a range of measures that
reliably alter each major factor that influences emissions 
from cars and light trucks.
<P>
     The policies constituting each package are categorized here
under their major factors of influence: VMT reduction, fuel
economy improvement, and alternative fuels use.  However,
policies directed toward any one factor can affect the other
factors.  Thus, the policies constituting a package interact, so
that the integrated emissions reduction achieved by a package of
measures can be different (higher or lower) than a simple
summation of the reductions estimated for each measure scored in
isolation.  The emissions reductions for each package were scored
using an integrated accounting model, developed by the Analytic 
Support Group for the purposes of the Committee, which accounts
for policy interactions.
<P>
     Policies were scored using "compromise" assumptions
regarding the responsiveness of the vehicle market and vehicle
travel to changes in the price of fuel or the variable cost per 
mile of travel.[1]  These assumptions were developed only for the
purposes of the Committee's work and do not reflect a consensus
that they provide an accurate or "best judgement" degree 
of market responsiveness.  Sensitivity analyses were performed
using assumptions reflecting the lower degree of market
responsiveness which some Committee members (including many 
issuing this report) feel are more accurate.[2]  Under such
assumptions, either higher fuel economy standards or a higher VMT
fee would be required for the 2005 package.  On the other hand,
such assumptions still imply a 10% safety margin for returning
emissions to the 1990 level by 2015 and, in fact, suggest that
emissions could be returned to the 1990 level by 2010 with a 1
mpg/year (combined fleet) fuel economy increase and a VMT fee of
only 0.2 per mile.

     [1]  See the Committee's interim report (Resolve. March
1995, p. 3)  The assumptions are: a fuel price elasticity of VMT
equal to 0.21; a cost-per-mile elasticity of VMT equal to 0.35; a
fuel price elasticity of new fleet MPG equal to 0.4 when the fuel
price exceeds a threshold of $0.25 gal. but equaling 0.25 below
this threshold.
     [2]  The most pertinent change is lowering the cost-per-mile
elasticity of VMT to -0.1.  The other key assumption is a lower
fuel price elasticity of new fleet MPG of 0.3, with a threshold
of $0.50/gal before the full effect is felt (so that this
elasticity ramps up from 0 to 0.3 as fuel price rises from zero
to $0.50/gal above the current real gasoline price).  
     [3]  Effects of PNGV are not scored separately, but assumed
to help in reaching fuel economy targets.  The fuel economy
standards continue to ramp-up at 1.5 mpg/yr (1.7 for cars and
1.25 for light trucks) through 2025, when the new light duty
fleet average would reach 66mpg, which is less than the 75mpg
that might be achieved if the whole fleet reached the PNGV
tripled fuel economy level by then.
     [4]  From revised analytic support group results of 9/15/95,
using response modeled by a ramp-up of a monthly average parking 
opportunity cost from $30 in 2005 to $80 in 2025. 
     [5]  The VMT fee is assumed to ramp up to 1.22/mile by 2005
and remain fixed thereafter.  The cost of driving would then
begin to fall because of the ongoing fuel economy increase.

     In examining the role higher vehicle efficiency can play in
reducing greenhouse gas emissions from personal transportation,
it is useful to look back at its role over the past two decades,
following the 1973 oil embargo that made MPG a household acronym.
The average on-road fuel economy of the fleet of US cars and
light trucks improved 60% during this time period, cutting fuel
use per mile by more than one-third.  Despite dire predictions
that new car CAFE standards requiring a 100% increase in average
new car fuel efficient from 13.8 to 27.5 MPG would eliminate all
large cars and force a fleet of sub-sub-compacts, new car fuel 
economy more than doubled by 1985 without any restriction on
consumer choice.  Despite the additional VMT growth that higher
vehicle efficiency induced, nationwide gasoline consumption is
roughly one-quarter lower (and petroleum use over 2 million
barrels per day lower) than it would be if fuel economy had not
improved. CAFE standards were the primary factor in this
increase, particularly since gasoline price has decreased since
1982 with today's real gasoline prices being lower than any time
in the 1960's or 1970's.
<P>
     Now, 20 years later, the dust from two oil crises has
settled and gasoline prices are at historic lows.  Today's cars
and light trucks are cleaner, safer, more durable, more reliable,
more powerful and more comfortable as well as more fuel efficient
than those in the showrooms of 1973.  Today's new car fuel
economy is more than twice that of 1974 models while vehicle
fatality rates have declined to less than half what they were in
1974.  That's technological progress.  While today's vehicles are
also more expensive than those of 1974, the cost for fuel economy
improvements are more than offset by the savings in gasoline
costs to the consumer.
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="IIIA2">Vision</A></STRONG>
<P>
     Looking ahead 10, 20, or 30 years, continued progress in
fuel economy can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Between now and 2015, improvements in fuel economy can produce
greater greenhouse gas reductions than any other policy.  Of the 
83 million metric tons (MMT) of reductions needed to return
greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2005, fuel economy
improvements can provide 36 MMT.  Of the 163 million metric tons
(MMT) of reductions needed to return greenhouse gas emissions to
1990 levels by 2015, fuel economy improvements can provide 88
MMT.  By 2025 fuel economy improvements can reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by 138 MMT while alternative fuel policies will total
117 MMT of reductions.  Technology improvements can be
implemented fleetwide over the next 10 years with similar
proportional improvements to the fuel consumption of all
vehicles.
<P>
     Obtaining such improvements in fuel economy will come from
increased CAFE standards with feebates to stimulate market demand
for more fuel efficient vehicles.  To the extent that gasoline
prices rise from higher petroleum prices or VMT fees, they will
help stimulate consumer demand for more fuel efficient vehicles. 
However, the Committee considered and rejected gasoline taxes as
a way to improve fuel economy for two reasons.  First, some
members of the Committee believed that it was politically
infeasible to raise gasoline taxes in any significant amount in
the near future.  Second, some members of the Committee did not
believe that any foreseeable level of gasoline taxes would match
the fuel economy levels produced by higher CAFE standards with
feebates.  
<P>
     In an effort to reach a compromise with the auto industry,
some members proposed using a market mechanism (such as the
gasoline taxes proposed by the auto industry) to be tried with a
mandatory trigger for increased CAFE standards if taxes or other
market mechanisms failed or could not be implemented.
<P>
     These reporting members of the Committee believed the best
method to improve new vehicle fleet economy is through increased
fuel economy standards which could be paired with feebates and
incentives such as a "green machine challenge".  New vehicle
fleet economy is made up of: the fuel efficiency of individual
vehicles, the mix of vehicles in the fleet, the mix of technology
in the vehicles in the fleet, and customers' choice of vehicle 
attributes.  Manufacturers can best impact the fuel efficiency of
new vehicles by incorporating new fuel efficiency technology into
their new models.  While the manufacturers' can influence vehicle
mix through vehicle and option pricing, this has less effect on
new fleet fuel economy than does improving the technology offered
on the different models in the fleet.  Analysis of the best in
class models demonstrates this.  If all the cars in each weight
class were as efficient as the most efficient vehicle in that
class, the fuel economy of America's fleet would be 33 mpg
instead of 28.2 mpg.  Offering consumers better technology such
as airbags and multi-valve engines which improve safety and both 
fuel economy and performance increases sales and profits.
<P>
     The new vehicle fleet for each of the three return year
scenarios (2005, 2015 and 2025) will offer at least the same
level of consumer attributes and performance as the present 
vehicle fleet.  Just as there were no restrictions on consumer
choice from 1975 to 1985 when average new car CAFE doubled, there
will be no restrictions on consumer choice between 1995 and 2005,
2015 or 2025.  The emphasis will be on developing and utilizing
new technology to maintain vehicle size and performance while
improving efficiency.  An example of this vision is the evolution
of the Honda Civic from 1975 to 1995.  In 1975, the Honda Civic
had a curb weight of 1650 pounds with a wheel base of 87 inches
and a CAFE rating of 35 MPG.  By 1995, the Civic increased
dramatically in size, weight and fuel economy.  The 1995 Civic VX
had a 103 inch wheelbase, a curb weight of 2540 pounds and a CAFE
rating of 57 MPG.  Despite a 50% increase in weight and a 16 inch
longer wheelbase, the Civic's fuel economy improved by 63%.
<P>
     Policies that increase the variable cost of driving
(especially in proportion to the amount of greenhouse gases
emitted by the vehicle) will increase the entire on-road fleet
fuel economy as well as the fuel economy of new vehicles.  Such
policies reduce the current demand for travel as well and change
the vehicle and attribute mix by increasing consumer demand for
vehicles with higher fuel economy.  Furthermore, these policies
will pull advanced fuel economy technologies into the market by
ensuring that consumers will value them.  Taken together, these
results can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 
personal transportation vehicles. 
<P>
     We expect progress in fuel efficiency; technological
advances are a hallmark of our industrialized society.  It is the
nature of innovation to provide either similar amenities at 
lower cost or greater amenities without higher costs.  Prototypes
of high fuel economy vehicles exist.  Bringing the improvements
these prototypes embody to market without greatly increasing
vehicle price, and while still meeting government standards and
customer expectations, is the challenge.  The path of
technological progress, while promising, is unpredictable but can
be pushed by government intervention as has so often been 
demonstrated in the past.
<P>
     Technological improvements are integral to achieving
greenhouse gas reduction goals.  Since attainment of the
statutory 27.5 MPG CAFE standards in 1985, ongoing fuel 
efficiency (combustion) improvements have been approximately 1%
per year, but have not recently resulted in commensurate
increases in fuel economy (miles per gallon).  Manufacturers have
utilized improvements in efficiency of engines, transmissions and
accessories to offer more options, size and performance.  The
success of CAFE is perhaps best seen in the 1982 to 1985 time
frame when average new car fuel economy increased by about 5 MPG
while real gasoline prices decreased by over 25%.  CAFE standards
never failed to raise fuel economy levels but they can only
increase fuel economy up to the level of that standard.  Since
1985, there has been no failure of CAFE, just a failure of
regulators and legislators to raise CAFE standards.  While
continuing fuelefficiency improvements will likely occur, the
extent to which they will lead to higher fuel economy is doubtful
without regulatory measures such as CAFE and indirect measures
such as feebates.  Adding VMT-fees or other pricing mechanism
will increase the effectiveness of regulatory measures.
<P>
     Our ability to envision further technological advances in
vehicle efficiency reflects our hope that the country will not
have to abandon the flexibilities and benefits of personal 
mobility.  Higher fuel economy, coupled with policies affecting
vehicle miles traveled and alternative fuels, means that energy
can be saved and greenhouse gas emissions reduced without
sacrificing vehicle ownership or the mobility and utility
valued by the broad majority of Americans, who currently own
passenger cars and light trucks and prize the personal 
freedom they so obtain.
<P>
     What will it take to achieve a degree of fuel economy
improvement enough to meet a national climate action commitment? 
The mechanisms to achieve a substantial measure of fuel economy
improvement will have at its core increased CAFE standards
accompanied by feebates and special market creation programs to
promote purchases of efficient vehicles, committed research and
development efforts to support technological improvements, and 
gradual but expected continuing increases in the price of
driving.  The last need not be accomplished by a net tax
increase, but rather by a VMT-fee increasing the marginal cost of
driving by "incrementalizing" some of a variety of currently
fixed fuel- or driving related costs.
<P>
     Policies addressing on-road fleet fuel economy must be
integrated with those impacting vehicle miles traveled and
alternative fuels.  Indeed, CAFE increases which 
improve the efficiency of cars help promote alternative fuel
vehicles (AFVs) by increasing their driving range and making AFVs
more attractive to consumers.  While significant near-
term fuel efficiency gains can come from existing technology,
large and dramatic efficiency gains of up to three times present
fuel efficiency as envisioned by the Partership for a New 
Generation Vehicle (PNGV) program can come only from successful
research into breakthrough technologies which is then required in
the market by CAFE standards accompanied by feebates and special
market creation programs. Without regulatory requirements to
capture the technological innovations being developed by the many
private and public R&D programs, the 80 to 100 MPG prototypes
will remain just for show and not for go on the roads of the
world.

<P>
<STRONG>Policy
</STRONG>
<P>
Federal legislation could require rebates proportional to the
extent to which a vehicle's fuel consumption is lower than
average and would assess fees to the extent to which fuel
consumption is higher than average.  For addressing greenhouse
gas emissions, feebates could be based on relative CO2  emissions
per mile.
<P>
     Several approaches can be taken to designing rational
feebate structure that balance the various concerns related to
improvements in fuel economy. For purposes of targeting 
greenhouse gas emissions, all approaches can start with vehicles'
CO2 emissions per mile (gCO2/km), computed from MPG ratings using
full fuel cycle emissions factors.  Three rather distinct
approaches are as follows:
<P>
     (1) Base feebates on crash worthiness and domestic content. 
Such a design would calculate a feebate using two factors.  One
is gCO2/km adjusted by crash worthiness as measured by a dynamic
impact test score.  The other is gCO2/km multiplied by domestic
content.
<P>
     (2) Base feebates on vehicle size with separate treatment of
cars and light trucks.  This design uses the same formula for all
vehicles, based on gCO2/km divided by vehicle footprint.  A
vehicle's feebate would be computed as a weighted sum of the 
size-adjusted term plus one based only on gCO2/km.
<P>  
     (3) Base feebates strictly on gCO2/km, but compute a
vehicle's feebate relative only to other vehicles made by the
same manufacturer fleet.  This approach may or may not 
separately treat cars and light trucks.
<P>
     The relative magnitude of feebates, whatever their
structure, needed to induce a given level of fuel economy
improvement is highly uncertain.  The response depends on a 
parameter called the "feebate rate", which gives the change in a
vehicle fee or rebate corresponding to a change in its fuel
consumption or CO2 emission rate.  This parameter underlies all
feebate structures, which may modify the rate depending on which
other attributes are incorporated into the feebate.  A published
analysis is available for feebate rates of approximately $6 per
gCO2/km and $12 per gCO2/km.  Scoring of feebate proposals for 
likely greenhouse gas emissions assumes use of the $12 per
gCO2/km rate.

While the outcome of this research project is in no way certain,
successful development of PNGV production prototypes and the
manufacturing technology required to produce them at competitive
cost would demonstrate the feasibility of producing 80-mpg family
sedans.  For the purpose of estimating emission reductions, we
have modeled three scenarios which vary according to the degress
of their success in achieving all program goals and show what
greenhouse gas reductions could be obtained if there were a shift
to production of PNGV sedans.
<P>
     Scenario 1:  All program goals are met.  Production
prototypes introduced in 2004 and vehicle production commences in
2006.  Production increases to satisfy growing consumer demand
but is limited by the capability to shift vehicle production
capacity to PNGV sedans without increasing costs or prematurely
idling the capacity to produce conventional vehicles.  The
maximum long run market share for PNGV sedans is assumed to be
85%.  Average PNGV fuel economy is 80 mpg (passenger cars) and 60
mpg (light trucks).
<P>
     Scenario 2:  A longer lead time is assumed from production
prototype introduction (2004) to mass production (2009).  This
longer lead time reflects current industry lead times.  PNGV
penetration rates grow less rapidly based on a more conservative 
estimate of the capability to shift vehicle production capacity
to PNGV sedans without increasing PNGV costs or prematurely
idling the capacity to produce conventional vehicles.  In
addition, PNGV sedans do not achieve as high a final market share
(60%  instead of 85%).  PNGV fuel economies are the same as in 
Scenario 1.
<P>
     Scenario 3:  This scenario assumes that the fuel economy
goals of PNGV sedans are only partially met. Instead of tripling
passenger car fuel economy (80 mpg), passenger car fuel economy
is only doubled (60 mpg) and light truck mpg only increases to 30
mpg.  In addition, PNGV production does not begin until 2012 and
the final market share of PNGV sedans only reaches 50%.

complexity while small enough to be an incentive to improve
rolling resistance within a class rather than just switch to a

Policies and
Reductions</A></FONT>

<P>

     In the decades ahead, alternative fuels combined with new
vehicle technology can provide transportation of today's quality
while greatly reducing greenhouse gases (GHG).  In addition to
such emission reductions per se, alternative fuel and vehicle
technologies represent significant opportunities to realize
reduction of criteria pollutant emissions, decrease oil imports,
and to benefit employment generally and the rural economy in
particular.  Finally, as both the world's largest vehicle
manufacturer and the home of the world's most aggressive effort 
to develop and deploy alternative fuels, the U.S. has an
opportunity to lead the world in developing highly-exportable new
technologies for production of new fuels and vehicles.
<P>
     Realization of these benefits will require a sustained R&D
effort which will span at least a decade along with policies that
promote use of alternative fuels and vehicles.  Industrial
participation in this effort is vital to its success, as is
public support.  The government has a legitimate and important
role to play as well.  How can we advocate an active governmental
role in the current political climate?  We believe that the
appropriate role for government is to be responsive to the public
interest by taking actions that would not be undertaken by the
private sector because the time-to-market is too long, the risks
are too high, or because environmental and other benefits to
society are not reflected by market forces.  In particular, the
time horizon for development of new fuels and vehicles is often
long relative to that for private-sector decision making, thus
the need for such fuels and vehicles must thus be anticipated
long before it becomes acute.  Finally, governmental action is
the only option we have to incorporate environmental goals such
as reducing GHG emissions into market-based decision-making since
the market by itself does not value these goals.

     The surest way to reduce carbon levels from motor vehicles
dramatically is to develop the pollution prevention technologies
already invented - eliminating the carbon at birth, so to speak. 
This approach to technology development may also propel the
American automobile industry into a strengthened role in a world
that will be eager to buy these cleaner cars.
<P>
     A new family of vehicles can be mass produced and fueled at
total cost per mile traveled comparable to the cost of internal
combustion engines fueled with gasoline.  Nevertheless, it is
likely that until the stock of these new vehicles accumulate and
before the technologies mature, these "cleaner" cars will have a
higher cost than conventional models.  For that reason,
alternative fueled vehicles will likely have a small impact by
2005, and a moderate impact by 2015.  However, with the technical
options already in hand and a sizable engineering and
commercialization effort, a significant portion of travel in 2025
can be virtually carbon free. 
<P>
     Public education must be a vital and sustained element of
this historic, fundamental shift of the nation's largest industry
and consumers favorite possession.  Industry and government must
be together in an education effort as to why this shift is
important.  The education effort should stress the health
benefits of driving vehicles that don't pollute.  The advantages
of not being subject to oil shocks and being able to improve our
balance of payments could all be part of the message as well as
the public policy goals.  Indeed, we are taking a major step
toward strengthening the American automobile industry on a
sustainable basis.

Fuels of the Future
</STRONG>
<P>
     Transportation sector options involving alternative fuels
and vehicles are characterized by conversion of an energy source
to a fuel, and utilization of a fuel in a vehicle to provide
mobility.  These processes involve a set of common
infrastructural elements, both off-vehicle (energy
production/extraction, energy conversion, fuel distribution, and
fuel delivery) and on-vehicle (fuel storage, fuel conversion, and
the engine).
<P>
Alternative fuels/vehicles can be divided into the following
categories:<BR><UL> 
     <LI>liquid fuels used in internal combustion engines
     <LI>non-liquid fuels in internal combustion engines (e.g.
natural gas)
     <LI>battery-powered electric vehicles
     <LI>fuel cell power sources.
</UL>
<P>
     Alternative transportation fuels have the technical
potential to almost eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from the
personal transportation sector as low-emission fuels can reduce
vehicular greenhouse gas emissions by 90% or more.  In addition,
these reductions can be achieved in vehicles that are not very
different than we use today.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Alternative Fuels
</STRONG>
<P>
     This section summarizes the work of Mark DeLuchi, which
provides comparative data for greenhouse gas emissions associated
with various alternative fuel options.  DeLuchi's study
encompasses a variety of greenhouse gasses (CO2, CH4, N2O, NMHC,
NOx) as well as elements of the fuel production/utilization cycle
(vehicle end use, compression or liquefaction, fuel distribution,
fuel production, feedstock transport, feedstock recovery, leaks
and flares, and vehicle assembly and materials).  The table below
presents relative CO2 production for  24 different alternative
fuel scenarios evaluated relative to a base case reflecting the
current status quo.  
<P>
     Of options involving liquid fuels in internal combustion
engines (group  2A), fossil fuel-based options offer at best
modest improvements over gasoline (> the 74% of base case
emissions for LPG).  By contrast woody biomass-based options
offer significant improvements, with emissions relative to the
base case of  25% for methanol, and 2% for ethanol.  Ethanol
production from corn however results in emissions higher than the
gasoline base-case in the DeLuchi study.<A HREF="#note2">[2]</A> 
<P>
     Options involving non-liquid fuels in internal combustion
engines (group 2B) and their respective emission percentages
relative to the base case are natural gas (76%), natural 
gas from wood (29%), liquified hydrogen produced from nuclear
power (82%), hydrides produced from nuclear power (33%), and
solar-derived hydrogen (7%).
<P>
     The greenhouse impact of options using battery-powered
electric vehicles (group 3) depends primarily on the source of
electricity and also on vehicle efficiency.  Thus, use of 
electricity generated from coal increases emissions relative to
the status quo, natural gas-derived electricity is intermediate
at 66% of the base case, and nuclear- and solar- derived 
electricity have much reduced emissions at 7 and 1% of the base
case respectively.  Greenhouse gas emissions for grid-supplied
electricity vary substantially (e.g. emissions 60 to 99% of
base-case emissions) depending on whether the power mix is
assumed to be marginal or average, whether charging is assumed to
be city only or city-highway.  Taking into account these factors
as well as pursuant communication from Dr. DeLuchi, the Committee
used a value of 80% of base-case greenhouse gas emissions for
electric vehicles powered by grid-supplied electricity. 
<P>
     Emission impacts of fuel cell-powered options (group 4) also
vary depending on the energy source, with relative emissions for
methanol derived from coal, natural gas, and wood at 102%, 56%,
and 15% respectively, nuclear hydrides as 15%, and solar hydrogen
at 2%.  For a given fuel, fuel cell-powered vehicles result in
lower emissions than internal combustion engines.

     The values presented above represent DeLuchi's current best
estimates. Uncertainties associated with these estimates arise
from several sources.  The following uncertainty categories were
outlined in correspondence with DeLuchi:
<P>
          <em>Technological uncertainty</em>  - e.g. the design
and performance of fuel cells or emission control strategies are
as yet unknown.  These uncertainties are particularly important
for projected performance of technologies that are not yet
mature, which include the majority of scenarios in Table 1.
<P>
          <em>Contextual uncertainty</em>  - e.g. GHG equivalency
factors or emissions of N 2O from fertilized soils.  These
uncertainties are associated with parameters that describe the
natural and anthropic systems in which fuel and vehicle
technologies function.
<P>
          <em>Discretionary uncertainty,</em> - e.g. how will
electric vehicles be driven, what fertilizer loadings will be
used in biomass production, what compression ratios will be used.
These uncertainties reflect how we choose to use technologies
rather than our inability to precisely predict GHG impacts of
known choices.
<P>
     In his presentation to the Committee and subsequent
communications, Dr. DeLuchi stated that:<P>
<UL>
<LI>There can be a very large range between worst-case and
best-case scenarios when these uncertainties are compounded.
<LI>Best estimates are more probable, and in many cases much more
probable, than the most and least favorable estimates;
<LI>The relative ranking indicated by the best estimates is very
robust even in the presence of uncertainty;
<LI>The use of solar or nuclear electricity (either directly in
electric vehicles or in hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles) and
the use of fuels derived from lignocellulosic biomass will
greatly reduce and in some cases nearly eliminate emissions of 
greenhouse gases;
<LI>Alternative fueled vehicles offer larger reductions in
greenhouse gas emissions than do either reduction of VMT or
increased vehicle efficiency;
<LI>For the purpose of comparing alternative fuels with
one-another, and of considering the mitigation potential of
alternative fuels together with the potential of fuel economy
improvements and VMT reductions, his advice to the Committee was
to use the best estimates.
</UL>
<P>
The table below presents the alternative fuel options considered
by DeLuchi rank ordered according to best-estimate greenhouse gas
reductions while noting the energy source for each.  It may be
seen that there is a strong correlation between emission
reduction potential and the energy source, with most alternatives
involving solar, biomass, and nuclear energy superior to
alternatives involving natural gas, natural gas generally
superior to oil, and oil generally superior to coal. There is
essentially no correlation between emission reduction potential
and engine type (data not shown), suggesting that the choice of
energy source is a more important variable in determining
greenhouse gas emissions than is engine type. 
<P>
     The available information suggests that there are some
potential "homeruns" with respect to reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions via the use of alternative fuels.  Options in 
this category include those based on solar, nuclear, and
biomass-based energy sources.  The potential of solar and nuclear
options is perhaps intuitive because the associated electrically-
or fuel cell-powered vehicles do not emit carbon.  This is not
the case for many of the biomass-based options, which have per
mile vehicle emissions comparable to conventional fuels. 
Instead, the attractiveness of biomass-based fuels stems from the
CO2-consuming character of photosynthesis, and the resulting
possibility of a sustainable carbon cycle with no net
contribution to the atmospheric CO2 pool.
<P>
     There appears to be a substantial consensus within the
technical community regarding the strong potential of cellulosic
biomass-based fuel options for greenhouse gas mitigation.  
Although ethanol production from corn is also reliant on
photosynthesis, greenhouse gas emissions for corn ethanol are
markedly greater than for cellulosic ethanol because of: 1) 
higher agricultural energy inputs for production of corn relative
to wood; 2) the presence of lignin in biomass, a nonfermentable
component which when burned can provide all process energy as
well as exported electricity for a typical wood feedstock.

Overview of Technical Barriers and Non-Greenhouse Impacts
</STRONG>
<P>
     Beyond the greenhouse mitigation potential of various fuel
options per se, additional important issues for evaluation
include: 1) the degree of infrastructure change and/or 
technology development required to implement various
alternatives, and 2) non-greenhouse gas impacts and benefits. 
The table below presents a summary of information pursuant to 
these issues.
<P>
     When GHG reductions are evaluated as a function of the
extent of infrastructure change or development needed, the most
attractive alternatives for near-term impact have large emission
reductions and relatively fewer required infrastructural changes
or development.  Options in this category include wood-derived
ethanol used in internal combustion engines, battery-powered
electric vehicles with low GHG electricity, wood-derived methanol
used in internal combustion engines, battery-powered electric
vehicles with solar electricity, wood-derived methanol used in
fuel cells, wood-derived natural gas used in internal combustion
engines, and solar-derived hydrogen used in internal combustion 
engines.   
<P>
     The Committee's evaluation of infrastructural barriers was
based largely on a survey, in which experts were asked to rate
infrastructural change/technology development with respect to
seven infrastructural elements.  Details of the survey are
presented in Appendix E. 
<P>
     Established fuels (natural gas, LPG and electricity) are
fossil-based, offer GHG reductions up to about 25% relative to
the status quo, and energy source development is not a 
key barrier.  Fuel delivery (from the retail distribution center
to the vehicle) is an issue for all three, and all three have
significant barriers to be overcome in the vehicle area as well. 
The required research intensity is low for LPG, medium for
natural gas, and high for electricity, with the latter rating
primarily attributable to vehicular issues.
<P>
     The non-established fuels (ethanol or methanol produced from
cellulosic biomass, solar electricity, and solar hydrogen) are
non-fossil based, offer greenhouse gas reductions of 75 to 99%
relative to the status quo, and all have energy source
development as a key barrier.  The principal barriers to using
alcohols from cellulosic biomass involve source development 
and especially conversion processes, with infrastructure and
vehicles less significant as constraining factors.  Both low GHG
electricity and hydrogen face significant barriers to
implementation in the areas of source development/conversion,
infrastructure, and vehicles.
<P>
     Several additional barriers to the implementation of
alternative fuels were also considered by the committee.  These
included higher vehicle costs (compared to conventional 
vehicles), limitations on range, uncertainty about resale value,
warranty issues for converted vehicles, lack of familiarity to
sales and service personnel, and lack of standardization for 
infrastructure (including fuel specifications, refueling
infrastructure and units of measure for energy density.) 
Policies to address some of these barriers are described later
in this section.
<P>
     All of the fuel options listed in the table offer the
potential for significant reductions of criteria pollutants.  For
several cases (LPG, natural gas, and the alcohols), the magnitude
of priority pollutants benefits is strongly dependent upon the
manner in which the fuel is used, with greater benefits for more
advanced vehicles that can be anticipated at higher levels 
of market penetration.  In addition, development of domestic
industries for production of non-established fuels represents an
opportunity to create jobs,increase exports, and decrease 
oil imports.
<P>
     The figure below presents GHG emission reductions for
various alternative fuel/vehicle combinations as a function of
the extent of infrastructural change or technology development
needed.  Infrastructural change/technology development is
quantified as presented, based on the following scale:
<P><PRE>
     0, Essentially no changes
     1, Minor qualitative modification to existing
          infrastructure/major expansion
     2, Significant modification to existing infrastructure
     3, Substantially new technology, minor development work
          required
     4, Substantially new technology, major development work
          required; major constraint to implementing 
          alternative  
</PRE>
<P>
     The most attractive alternatives for near-term impact have
large emission reductions (a high value on the Y-axis) coupled
with relatively little required in the way of infrastructural
change (a low value on the x-axis).  Options exhibiting these
features include wood derived ethanol used in internal combustion
engines, battery-powered electric vehicles with low greenhouse
gas electricity, wood-derived methanol used in fuel cells,
wood-derived natural gas used in internal combustion engines, and
solar-derived hydrogen used in internal combustion engines.

<A NAME="IIIB2">Alternative Fuels and Vehicles Policy
Overview</A></STRONG>
<P>
     In the course of its deliberations, the Committee sought to
consider the broad range of alternative fuel and vehicle
alternatives, looking at 24 different alternatives. The 
group also considered policies that were fuel-neutral and
performance-based to as great an extent as possible. 
Notwithstanding a predisposition to be fuel-neutral, 
three fuel-specific policies resulted from a year of intensive
effort.  This result reflects in part the limited range of
alternatives that are likely to offer significant GHG reductions
in the timeframes required by the charge.
<P>
     An important element of the recommendations in the
alternative fuels and vehicles area involves fuel-neutral price
supports available to all liquid and gaseous alternative fuels 
on a GHG emission reduction-proportional basis.  This policy
element is contained within the policy "Enhanced Research and
Development for Liquid Biofuels and Incentives for other 
Low-GHG Fuels" because cellulosic ethanol is the chief
anticipated beneficiary of this policy, and because some
Committee members felt strongly that the establishment of fuel-
neutral price supports should be linked both fiscally and
politically to the current ethanol tax incentive.
<P>
     The Committee considered a comprehensive R&D initiative
encompassing all fuels offering greenhouse gas benefits. 
Although attractive in concept, this was rejected primarily 
because:
<P>
          1)  Different fuels have very different needs in terms
of overall resources and how these resources should be allocated
(e.g. between commercialization and R&D).
<P>       
          2)  In the world outside of our deliberations,
significant components of the rationale for supporting various
fuels will arise due to considerations other than greenhouse
gases.  Since these considerations are different for the 
different fuels, it is difficult to present a common rationale
for an integrated policy, and thus to gain political support -
this dynamic was played out in the Ad Hoc group and would also
exist in broader debates outside of this report.
<P>  
     In light of the potential for expanded use of electric
vehicles, the Committee considered making recommendations with
respect to policies to decrease GHG emissions from the utility
sector.  A decision was made not to make such recommendations,
because utilities play such a small role in transportation today,
because this matter is being examined in other fora, and because
of a sense that the Committee's composition was not well-suited
to consider this issue.  Notwithstanding, the Committee
recognizes significant desirable features of using low
GHG-emitting electricity (or hydrogen derived therefrom) as an
energy carrier for transportation.  We thus strongly urge that
the potential of substantial electricity demand from the
transportation sector be considered in other fora addressing the
utility sector, and that this potential add impetus to the need
for developing low GHG-emitting sources of electricity.
<P>
     It should be noted that electric vehicles are considered in
this report in the Fuel Economy Section as well as the
Alternative Fuels and Vehicles Section.  This is largely 
because the Partnership for New Generation Vehicles (PNGV) is
defined in terms of increased efficiency, and is a negotiated
agreement not easily subject to modification.  The Electric
Vehicle Policy in this section augments the PNGV by providing
commercialization incentives in the form of an extended electric
vehicle tax credit, and by providing for increased R&D on battery
powered vehicles, including fuel cell/battery hybrids.  As 
discussed elsewhere in this report, the PNGV encompasses a
broader range of vehicle alternatives.
<P>
     The Committee's projections indicate that increased fuel
economy and alternative fuel utilization are the major
contributors to realizing target emission reductions in 2015 and 
2025.  It is thus relevant to consider the interaction between
these.  Many combinations of efficiency-improving technology and
fuel substitution are compatible in the sense that they can both
be implemented on the same vehicle.  For example, ethanol or
natural gas can be used in a high-efficiency ICE vehicle or in
many advanced vehicles that are potential outcomes of the PNGV,
and a significant fraction of potential PNGV vehicles are powered
by electricity.  It is desirable that technologies to increase
fuel economy and fuel substitution technologies be developed in
an interactive fashion to maximize overall effectiveness in 
terms of reducing greenhouse gases as well as other benefits.

<STRONG><A NAME="IIIB3a">Enhanced Research & Development for 
Liquid Biofuels and Incentives for other Low-GHG Emitting
Fuel</A>
<P>
Policy
</STRONG>
<P>
Increase R&D funding and provide incentives to encourage
production of low greenhouse gas-emitting fuels. 
<P>
     The R&D program targets reducing the cost of
cellulosic-based ethanol via improved biochemical conversion
technology as well as improved cellulosic energy crops and 
procedures for their cultivation.  The program could be broadened
to include biomass-derived methanol if new information were to
suggest that R&D-driven improvements could result in production
costs and greenhouse gas savings on the order of those projected
here for ethanol.  R&D funding would increase from about $25
million per year currently to $50 million in FY 1997, $75 million
in FY 1998, and $100 million per year for FY 1999 to 2005. 
Production incentives would be achieved by establishing an annual
pool of $1 billion available to producers of alternative fuels in
proportion to full-cycle greenhouse gas emissions (based on 
a facility-by-facility audit), with the pool phased-out over the
period 2015 to 2025.  This pool would include the current ethanol
tax incentive, which would be capped at its current overall 
level of $600 million per year and would be phased-out linearly
over the period 2000 to 2010.  Currently, the ethanol tax
incentive is authorized through 2000.  An amount of funds 
corresponding to the difference between $1.1 billion and the
amount of the current ethanol tax incentive in that year would be
allocated to alternative fuel producers on a basis proportional
to reduced greenhouse gas emissions.  Corn ethanol would qualify
either for the remainder of the current ethanol tax incentive or
the greenhouse gas emissions-based incentive, whichever is
greater, but not both.  The incentive to producers would be
through tax waivers and/or direct payment, with the total capped
at $180 per MTCE reduced (or about 54 cents per gallon based on
DeLuchi's wood/ethanol scenario).
<P>
     This policy fosters development of low greenhouse gas
emitting fuels, while also attaching a market value to reduced
greenhouse gas emissions.  A R&D program devoted to liquid
biofuels is consistent with their predicted greenhouse gas
benefits.  Both the possibility of including methanol as well as
ethanol and the availability of incentives to all fuels are 
intended to provide flexibility in pursuing the goal of reduced
emissions.  The production incentive component is designed to
give a large cost advantage to low greenhouse gas emitting fuels
at low levels of production when the technology is least mature,
with per-gallon and per-tonne MTCE subsidies decreasing as
volumesincrease.  Thus, the impact on the Treasury is capped, and
expanded production of alternativefuels will only proceed as the 
fuels become more cost-competitive.  The cost of the policy is
independent of actual ethanol and gasoline prices, both of which
are uncertain.  The magnitude of the subsidy is chosen so 
as to eliminate the cost differential between ethanol and
gasoline, assuming successful R&D to reduce costs and a gasoline
price in between the flat and rising price scenarios.  If the 
actual ethanol-gasoline price differential were larger than
assumed, rates of ethanol market penetration would be slowed
and/or profits for ethanol producers would be smaller, with the 
opposite result if the actual price differential were smaller
than assumed.  The fastest way to get a cellulosic ethanol
industry established, and to begin torealize greenhouse gas
benefits therefrom, is by a transition from corn to cellulosic
feedstocks in existing facilities.  The timing of the phase-out
of the current tax incentive is chosen to give the current
ethanol industry, and the farmers it supports, time to make such
a transition.
<P>
<STRONG>
Estimated Impact on Emissions
</STRONG>
<P>
     Reduced greenhouse gas emissions resulting from this policy
are driven by the assumed amount of ethanol produced.  Based on
work by Committee member Lee Lynd, ethanol production has been
estimated to be 2 billion gallons in 2005, 15 billion gallons in 
2015, and 40 billion gallons in 2025.  Ethanol is assumed to be
blended with gasoline either directly or as ETBE at levels rising
to 17% ethanol by volume. Around 2015, projected ethanol
production will exceed the level at which it can be blended into
gasoline without vehicle modifications and ethanol will begin to
be used as a near-neat fuel (greater than or equal to 85% ethanol
by volume).  The transition from low-level blends to neat fuels
is expected to be market driven with little if any Federal
intervention.  The policy is scored assuming that R&D results in
lower ethanol production costs (50 to 70 cents per gallon 
ethanol), consistent with analyses of R&D-driven improvements by
Lynd et al and by DOE.  Some other analyses have projected higher
prices, however these were generally based on a lower R&D
intensity and/or more near-term application than
considered by the group.   The greenhouse gas impact was derived
from the ethanol production volume assumption and DeLuchi's
estimates of greenhouse gas emissions savings (97 percent
reduction compared to reformulated gasoline).  As an
illustration, the following table presents projected values used 
in scoring this policy for a flat oil-price scenario and R&D
success as projected by Lynd et al.

<P>
Policy
</STRONG>
<P>
Subsidize incremental vehicle cost, CNG station construction
costs, and fuel costs to achieve critical mass and economies of
scale in the natural gas vehicle (NGV) industry.  
<P>
     This policy consists of four primary components to encourage
large-scale introduction of NGVs in the consumer car and light
truck fleet:
<P>
1)research, development, & demonstration (R,D,&D) support on
reducing the costs of Vehicle Refueling Appliances (VRAs),<BR>
2)federal vehicle subsidies to reduce incremental natural gas
vehicle costs to $500;<BR>
3)federal subsidies to service stations to reduce CNG station
installation costs to $1500/scfm; and<BR>
4)continuation of the Federal CNG excise tax incentive.  
<P>
     VRAs allow households with natural gas access and
appropriate facilities to refuel conveniently from home or from a
commercial site.  This policy provides for $10 million ($2 
million a year for five years) in R,D,&D money to reduce costs to
$1000 installed.  
<P>
     Current NGV incremental vehicle cost is roughly $3500.  This
policy provides for subsidies to reduce the incremental cost to
$500.  This subsidy will be phased-out as NGV incremental costs
approach $500 per vehicle.  It is estimated that at production
levels of 50,000 vehicles, the NGV incremental cost will drop to
$1000 and that at production levels of 200,000 vehicles, the NGV
incremental cost will drop to $500.
<P>
     Current CNG station construction costs for a 100 scfm is
$3000/scfm.  This policy provides for $31 million in subsides to
reduce out-of-pocket costs to station owners to $1500/scfm.  This
subsidy will not be  necessary as production volumes reduce costs
to the $1500/scfm target.
<P>
     This policy also includes the continuation of the Federal
highway motor fuel excise tax incentive equivalent to 12.9 cents
per GGE (gasoline is taxed at the rate of 18.4 cents per 
gallon compared to 5.5 cents per GGE for compressed natural gas).
<P>
<STRONG>
Estimated Impact on Emissions
</STRONG>
<P>
     The driving assumption for estimating greenhouse gas
emissions impacts of this policy is NGV market penetration.  For
purposes of scoring this policy, it is assumed that annual NGV
production/sales reaches 70,000 in 2000 and rapidly
increases to over 1 million vehicles in 2003, eventually
capturing a 10% market share of consumer car and light truck 
sales  [or 6.7% of the total car and light truck market including
fleet sales.  The incremental sales from this policy are assumed
to be in the consumer market only, however].  This rate of 
market penetration is made possible because this policy reduces
some of the major barriers to NGVs by providing incentives for
CNG refueling stations, low-costs VRAs to provide 
refueling at home/on-site, and low-cost fuel.  Though NGV buyers
will pay a $500 premium, their expected payback ranges between
3.3 and 4.9 years.  The greenhouse gas impact was derived from
the CNG usage rate implied by the market penetration assumption
and DeLuchi's estimate of greenhouse gas savings (20 percent
reduction compared to reformulated gasoline on a full-fuel-cycle
basis).  Following is a table of NGV market penetration, stock
penetration, CNG usage, and greenhouse gas impact:

<P>
     In keeping with the Charter of this Committee, this
assessment focuses upon the personal consumer vehicle.  It is
generally recognized that the use of NGVs in commercial 
fleets can result in even greater benefits.  Therefore, before
this policy option is implemented alone, additional analysis
should be undertaken to ascertain the emissions reduction
potential for larger fleet applications.
<P>
Cost and Cost Effectiveness
<P>
     For purposes of scoring this policy, it is assumed that 1)
VRA R,D,&D is $2 million per year from 1996 to 2000; 2) Stations
are subsidized by nearly $31 million (total) between 
1998 and 2000; 3) Vehicles are subsidized by about $340 million
(total) between 1997 and 2000; and 4) that the Federal excise tax
incentive is continued indefinitely for a cumulative total of
about $17.0 billion.  The table below illustrates costs for this
policy, as well as costs per tonne of greenhouse gas reduction. 
In addition to scoring the cost-effectiveness of this policy in
terms of cost per greenhouse gas reduction, it is possible to
score this policy also taking criteria pollution reduction into
account. Depending on the assumed level of criteria emission
reduction from NGVs, the overall cost-effectiveness of this
policy ranges from $120 to $140 per tonne of greenhouse gas
emission reduction when the value of criteria pollution reduction
is taken into account.<A HREF="#note3">[3]</A>

<A NAME="IIIB3c">Support for Electric Vehicles</A>
<P>
Policy
</STRONG>
<P>
Increase electric vehicle (EV) R&D and extend EV tax credit to
accelerate EV introduction into the light-duty vehicle fleet.  
<P>
     For purposes of this policy, EVs are electric drive vehicles
powered by electricity stored by batteries and/or generated by
fuel cells (thus differentiating itself from the likely R&D
outcome of PNGV, hybrid vehicles, that may or may not utilize
electric drive solely).  The two components of this policy are to
double Federal funding for EV R&D from $100 million currently to
$200 million (from the period 1996 to 2005) and to extend the
current EV tax credit, that is set to expire in 2005, ten more
years.
<P>
     Electric vehicles (EVs), including battery and hybrid fuel
cell/battery powered vehicles, represent an opportunity to reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions significantly because of their
ability to utilize carbon-free fuels and their intrinsic higher
efficiency compared to gasoline vehicles.  They also represent an
important opportunity to reduce urban smog and improve air
quality generally by offering an effective means to reduce mobile
source emissions of criteria pollutants including carbon monoxide
and the ozone precursors: volatile organic compounds, and
nitrogen oxides.  There is potential for even greater 
greenhouse gas emission reductions with electric vehicles as the
greenhouse gas emissions of the electricity used to charge
batteries, and to produce hydrogen for fuel cells, are reduced 
through time through the commercialization of solar energy, wind
power, and biomass as well as the possibility of other low
greenhouse gas sources. These lower greenhouse gas electricity
sources could replace current higher greenhouse gas sources in
the electricity generation grid.
<P><STRONG>
Estimated Impact on Emissions</STRONG>
<P>
     The driving assumption for estimating greenhouse gas
emissions impacts of this policy is EV market penetration.  For
purposes of scoring this policy, it is assumed that EV 
market penetration reaches 2% nationally in 2005, 5% in 2010, and
10% in 2015 and thereafter.  The distribution of vehicle use
would not need to be even throughout the nation.  That is to say,
urbanized areas with high levels of air pollution could take the
lead in the introduction of EVs and the GHG benefits would happen
simultaneously with air pollution benefits making the policy yet
more cost-effective.  This rate of market penetration is made 
guaranteed by providing additional resources for EV R&D and
providing tax credit incentives for consumers to purchase EVs. 
The GHG impact estimates were derived from the gasoline
displacement implied by the market penetration assumption
(assuming an EV displaces one gasoline-powered vehicle totally)
and DeLuchi's estimate of greenhouse gas savings (20 percent
reduction compared to reformulated gasoline on a full-fuel-cycle
basis).  Following is a table of EV market share, stock

     For purposes of scoring this policy, it is assumed that $100

that the EV tax credit through 2004  is in the base case.  This
policy incurs a cost of $100 million per year from 1996 to 2005
to account for increasing EV R&D and this policy incurs a cost of
$1 billion per year from 2005 to 2014 to account for extending
the EV tax credit an additional 10 years (the tax credit is

<A NAME="IIIC1">
Background
</A>
<P>
     Throughout the latter part of the nineteen eighties,
Americans drove more and farther than ever before.  Driving
increased even though we were nearing a saturation point in the
number of Americans with drivers licenses.  Reducing the number
of miles Americans travel is one important strategy for reducing
the consumption of carbon-based fuels, and therefore reducing 
the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global climate
change.
<P>
<A NAME="IIIC2">History</A>
<P>
     Beginning with the adoption of a model uniform zoning code
by the Department of Commerce in the 1930s, a series of direct
and indirect government actions paved the way for a new type of
community organization that has dominated our development
patterns in this century.  This new development pattern was
characterized by single use zoning which physically separated
work activities, shopping, and living places from one another. 
The cities and suburbs where most Americans live are thus
structured around the automobile - zoning codes, financing 
systems and tax laws encourage developers to build single family
homes on large lots which are physically separated from daily
activities.  Originally these laws were meant to protect us from 
industrial odors, but now they separate us from a loaf of bread,
from the hardware store and from the elementary school. 
Auto-oriented suburbs introduced new street patterns organized
around cul-de-sacs extending from arterial streets and by road
design standards intended to allow cars to operate at high rates
of speed in residential areas without pedestrian interference.
<P>
     After World War II, a series of governmental decisions
combined with the workings of the market to reorient our economy
around new development. Manufacturing plants that had 
geared up for war time production of weapons, tanks and jeeps,
shifted to automobiles and household consumer projects.  People
who had left the farm or the city to join the war effort 
settled in the West and Southwest, using VA loans to purchase new
single family homes in new suburbs.  By and large, these suburbs
were located on cheap land rendered valuable by federally 
financed infrastructure, particularly the Interstate Highway
System.  Many of these subsidy arrangements and financing
structures continue to this day, only they are now so imbedded
that we call them the working of the free market.
<P>
     As a result, efforts to reduce auto use are swimming
upstream.  In the 1980s  savings and loan deregulation fueled a
new explosion in suburban development along outer beltways all
over America.  Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) grew at over 4
percent a year from 1983 to 1990.  According to the National
Personal Transportation Survey, the length of average auto
commutes in urban areas grew by 25.6 percent during that same
period.  Public concern over congestion and sprawl is growing, as
evidenced by a May Newsweek cover story about the decline of the 
suburbs and recent reports about commute-induced stress in the
Washington Post. 
<P>
<A NAME="IIIC3">Policy Overview</A>
<P>
     At the present time, most Americans have no choice but to
drive for most of their trips.  Walking or bicycling is difficult
because streets lack sidewalks or shopping, schools and libraries
are accessible only by motor vehicle.  Public transit is often
not within reach, and when it is, it often is more expensive than
driving and less frequent than one would need.   
<P>
     The goal should be a multifaceted approach that makes the
choice not to drive easier to make, rather than an approach which
seeks to prevent us from driving.   In large part, this effort 
to reduce driving is also an effort to make communities places
people will like to live in and share in, rather than continuing
to create transient places in which we build equity.  
<P>
     The goal cannot be achieved by pouring greater and greater
sums into building more conventional rail and bus systems. 
Rather, we recommend an approach that simultaneously 
provides options to driving while creating market signals which
favor living in communities where alternatives are available and
using those alternatives.
<P>
     Such a multifaceted approach to reducing VMT is outlined
below.  Because changing the way all of us think about getting to
work or picking up groceries, buying a home, and even what 
kind of community we want to live is a significant task, VMT
reductions will be particularly difficult to achieve.   The
policies we advocate will be important to achieving the
President's goal in 2005.  While VMT policies will have a greater
role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in later years, it is
essential that changes in this area begin now.

<P>
Land-Use and Communities:  Creating High Access Livable Places
(HALP)</STRONG>
<P>
     The goal of the policies focused on land use is a deliberate
and gradual removal of government regulations and government
supported market subsidies which favor decentralization 
and single-use auto-dependent development.  In place of these
subsidies would be a set of policies which allow, and even
encourage, resource efficient, mixed use walkable communities.  
Single family suburban development may continue to be the choice
of many-due to schools, employment patterns, race and class
issues among others.  It is necessary, however, to create 
affordable choices of other kinds of communities, and eliminate
market distortions which prevent such communities from
developing. Even suburban communities can be configured to be
much more efficient with mixed use community centers and improved
pedestrian and transit accessibility.  Given that non-work trips
constitute a majority of all trips, improving access to 
shopping, schools, and services from both the suburban residence
and the workplace can help to reduce these trips.
<P>
     Along with more efficient suburban growth patterns, many
people may prefer a more urban lifestyle, including young adults,
"empty nesters", some ethnic groups and perhaps the elderly. 
Policies should ensure that well developed livable communities
are available in urban areas as well and this may entail both
redevelopment and renovation of existing neighborhoods 
and new development in former industrial areas and around
existing or new transit stations and downtown living.  A similar
opportunity exists for the redevelopment of older inner ring
suburbs as they age.  Tremendous private and public capital is at
risk of being stranded as post war suburbs age - in older
shopping centers, strip malls, offices and housing subdivisions. 
Suburban jurisdictions and investors alike need to be given a way
to hang onto the value of these investments and the creation of
High Access Livable Places may be the solution.  Over time our 
goal is a doubling of density in core parts of major cities.  In
many ways this is a modest goal, as a doubling of density in most
of these areas leads only to moderate density development.  Such 
development intensities can, however, support neighborhood
serving retail and transit.

<P>
1.   Development of model zoning codes and parking requirements
in concert with developers, architects, planners, city managers
and other local government and public interest groups.  
<P>
     The model codes would allow mixed use development,  grid
street patterns, sidewalks, mixed income and mixed housing stock
communities.  A similar effort would be undertaken to reduce
parking requirements for transit oriented mixed use livable
places.  These codes would be promulgated as models and
distributed widely by federal agencies including the Departments
of Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation,
Interior, Energy and Health and Human Services.
<P>
     Model zoning codes promulgated by the Department of Commerce
during the 1930's were widely adopted by counties and cities all
over America. These codes mandated the development of
functionally segregated suburban and exurban communities.  An
ongoing effort of the American Planning Association and the
efforts of a group of architects, planners and developers under
the banner of the New Urbanism both seek to provide alternative
models for both infill and new development.  A new model zoning
code, if coupled with altered parking requirements and traffic
and street standards, could do much to encourage and allow the 
development of mixed use and pedestrian and transit oriented
communities. During its site visit, the Committee met with
developers in Pasadena, California who identified incompatible
local government regulation as a key obstacle to undertaking less
auto intensive development patterns.
<P>
     The federal government's role would be to fund the
collaborative development of model planning, zoning parking and
local street guidelines and then to use federal agencies to 
promulgate these guidelines as new standards for communities
which wish to develop in a more sustainable way.  At the same
time an effort should be initiated to undertake research and 
develop tools which enable cities, counties and regions to
research and understand the long range fiscal implications of
sprawl oriented development on fiscal capacity, tax base,
provision of infrastructure (roads, transit, water, sewer,
telecommunications and power) and the provision of 
services (police, fire, libraries, social services and school). 
The research would result in user friendly products for local
officials to use in planning as well as in considering
development proposals.  The government expenditures on these
programs was estimated by transportation planners on the
Committee to be about $20-25 million.
<P>
2.   Development of programs to encourage the redevelopment of
inner-city properties, especially "brownfield " abandoned
industrial sites and transit and pedestrian oriented 
mixed use communities.  
<P>
     The program would link existing "Clean Sites" programs with
transit oriented development strategies. This option builds on an
existing effort under the "Clean Sites" program to clean up
polluted inner city sites to allow infill development to occur on
these sites.  The project would recognize that clean up is only
one barrier to economic development of abandoned industrial sites
and that other barriers exists, including availability of labor,
relationship to the surrounding community and access to the
transportation network. Many of these barrier require 
an integrated land use and transportation planning solution.  The
project would engage local planners, community developers and
transportation providers in the development of a planning 
process for these "clean sites" that would ensure mixed use,
transit and pedestrian oriented development that provides a high
level of intermodal access.  The federal government's role 
would be both to ensure that these considerations are being
explored and to provide seed funding for the development of these
plans through the Department of Transportation.  A government 
program cost of $2-3 million per affected community is estimated
by the transportation planners on the Committee for the conduct
of a public collaborative planning effort.
<P>
3.   A government led public/private mixed use financing
initiative to identify and end barriers to financing of higher
density, mixed use transit oriented development.  
<P>
     Government regulations and lending requirements were cited
by builders and developers in Los Angeles as preventing the
development of mixed use projects that were very marketable. 
Developers identified a number of problems in amassing the
capital to build higher density, mixed use developments oriented
toward transit and pedestrian travel.  The first problem of 
incompatible local government regulation is discussed above.  The
second problem is the difficulty of obtaining financing for mixed
use projects which combine, for instance, townhomes, 
apartments, retail and some office on the same site, or even for
single family residences with accessory apartments on site. 
Government programs for low income housing finance often do 
not allow mixed uses to occur and the same problem occurs in
securing private capital.  Developers stress that the problem is
not the lack of a consumer demand, but rather the lack of 
recognition of that demand on the part of sources of public and
private capital, particularly in secondary markets.  This project
would attempt to resolve the problem by gathering together 
developers, architects and planners, local government officials
and development finance interests including banks, pension and
insurance investors, public corporations such as Fannie Mae which
provide secondary markets and community development corporations
in an effort to identify and end barriers to obtaining financing
for these kind of projects.  The initial government cost is 
estimated at $1-2 million for both the planning effort and the
research which is likely to be suggested at the conclusion of the
effort.
<P>
4.   Development of a program for location efficient mortgages,
which recognizes the reduced household expenses that derive from
living in dense, transit rich communities and would utilize these
savings in mortgage qualification of prospective homeowners in
these communities.  Further study and development of this concept
with the Administration and the housing finance community is a
necessary first step. 
<P>
     This policy build upon research conducted by John Holtzclaw
and David Goldstein for the Natural Resources Defense Council
which found correlation between reduced driving and 
density and transit access.  The insight which emerged from this
research was that this VMT reduction also results in lower
expenses for driving, which in turn leads to a higher proportion
of household income not devoted to transportation.  These savings
can be calculated as part of the PITI, which is the formula for
calculating the amount of a mortgage a household can support.  
Thus the savings in these neighborhoods can result in the
issuance of Location Efficient Mortgages and in the purchase of
prepaid transit passes to secure the savings.  This strategy has 
been included in the PCSD recommendations and in the President's
Home Ownership Initiative and Fannie Mae has agreed to
participate in a demonstration.  The next step is a rigorous
analysis of market potential in three cities - Los Angeles, San
Francisco, and Chicago - to answer questions on existing research
and to engage the banking and mortgage lending community in 
working out the instruments for LEM.  The government cost of this
initial effort is estimated by transportation planners on the
Committee to be under $2 million.  An option for permanent 
funding is secondary mortgage.
<P>
5.   Development and enforcement of a policy to require
government facilities and services to be located in areas that
are accessible by public transit and accessible to the 
population served.
<P>
     Government facilities contribute to the development of a
culture where there is a lack of alternatives to driving when
they are located in ex-urban areas accessible by automobile. 
Such location decisions force workers and people who need
services to drive, and encourage related development to occur
near the site.  Government facilities can contribute to the
solution rather than the problem by choosing locations
inaccessible communities, with mixed use opportunities 
nearby, by  locating on transit lines and by providing on-site
amenities that lessen the need to travel during the day such as
day care and worker-serving retail.  It is particularly critical
for social service facilities to be accessible, as studies show
that very low income people spend a disproportionately high
portion of their income and time on travel.  This time and
expense spent traveling to services is an expense to government,
as well as time not devoted to looking for work or working. The
transportation planners on the Committee estimated that this
proposal could have moderate costs, because sites in higher
density, transit accessible communities may be more expensive
than 'greenfield sites."
<P>
6.   Reinvention of integrated community development and
infrastructure grant programs at HUD, HHS, DOT, Energy,
Agriculture and other agencies to ensure that the various grants
can be combined to allow co-location of service and coordinated 
development of mixed use projects. 
<P>
     The Administration's Empowerment Zone/Empowerment Community
Program (EZ/EC) included proposal's to streamline and coordinate
grant administration and delivery mechanisms for a variety of
grants and loans that can be used to revitalize communities. 
Both institutions and rules and regulations generally inhibit the
coordination of federal funding streams at the local 
level. These efforts generally involve coordinating social
service and community development funding, but should be extended
to incorporate infrastructure funding and other government 
programs.  The EZ/EC model needs to be implemented and should
also be extended in other areas to allow an integrated approach
to community revitalization and infill, so that for example, 
FTA and FHWA funding for transit and road infrastructure can be
co-mingled with housing and other community development
subsidies. This would allow developers to "write down" the 
development cost for an inner city development so that it is
competitive with lower cost "greenfield" development.  This
approach merely tries to provide the same cost advantage that 
free interstate access and subsidized power and sewer have
offered to exurban locations.   Another example would be the
coordinated delivery of grants to subsidize transit, which now 
originate at FTA and at a plethora of other agencies for
specialized services for the elderly, the disabled, youth and
other population groups, resulting in uncoordinated services. 
The principal government costs of this proposal will be in staff
time in redesigning regulations and rules.  The policy should
result in more bang for the buck.
<P>
7.   Extension of the regional and statewide planning structure
developed under ISTEA to other programs which influence and guide
growth and development -- HUD's new block grants, HHS service
grants, etc.  All should be linked to a regional structure for 
metropolitan planning so that housing, business development and
service delivery can be regionally designed and delivered as part
of regional growth strategies.  ISTEA's regional 
structure should be maintained and the Administration needs to
support the flexibility, planning, public involvement and program
emphases of ISTEA and extend them to other government programs.
<P>
     The ISTEA legislation charges metropolitan planning
organizations with conducting a public, region-wide planning and
programming process in close consultation with state governments. 
For the first time, significant authority is vested in bodies
which cover entire metropolitan regions.  Although these agencies
are experiencing growing pains, the shift to regional decision
making about investment of public capital and coordinated
planning and away from disconnected decision making by local
bodies reflects essential economic reality.   Unfortunately few
other government programs have a metropolitan context,
incorporating center city, older suburb and emerging suburb or
"edge city."  HUD's emerging emphasis on regionalism needs to be
supported, strengthened and explicitly merged with planning
contexts inherently in ISTEA.  Similarly, HHS grants, Department
of Commerce programs, and urban and edge programs at Agriculture,
Interior, Education and Justice need to be given a metropolitan 
context through these collaborative ventures between states and
local governments at the regional level.  Only through creating a
regional investment context and forcing the difficult debates can
economic development needs be balanced with the equity and
environmental imperatives for encouraging higher density, choice
oriented development.  
<P>
     The regional bodies would be charged with making investment
decisions about public capital and public services, rather than
usurping local control over zoning.  The government cost 
of this proposal is estimated by transportation planners on the
Committee to be relatively small.  ISTEA's regional governments
consume a 1% takedown for administration of planning and 
programming.  There would likely be savings from the elimination
of duplicative and competitive investment and services that could
far outweigh the costs.
<P>
8.   This policy involves the development of a bicycle and
pedestrian infrastructure in communities throughout America
through continuation of ISTEA funding programs and through the
development of zoning codes which stress accessibility.  A key
part of it is the revision of design standards as per current
National Highway System legislation to provide for access to
other modes on highway projects.  Another component might be the
education of the public and local government on the importance of
sidewalks in creating safe and livable places.  This policy would
make bike paths available on all major roads in urban areas with
over 1 million people (top 38 Metropolitan Statistical Areas
(MSAs)).
<P>
     Most suburban communities developed after World War II lack
pedestrian or bicycle accessibility.  Where sidewalks exist, they
are discontinuous and often connect residential areas 
internally without connecting shopping or service oriented
developments.  This policy proposes a federally assisted program
to reclaim safe communities through making sidewalk retrofit an 
eligible category for federal highway funds in the Surface
Transportation Program.  In addition, FHWA law would be amended
to be clear that pedestrian and bicycle access is eligible on all
new federally assisted projects.  An additional 2.5 cents is
scheduled to be returned to the Highway Trust Fund and the Mass
Transit Account this next year and the increased eligibility 
could be incorporated into and made a priority for the
Administration's proposal for the reauthorization of ISTEA. 
Public support for sidewalk and bicycle projects is high, both
for transportation of adults and to ensure safety and
accessibility for children, who are increasingly 
impacted by high speed auto traffic.  This proposal would simply
add eligibility and priority for a new spending category in the
Federal Aid Highway program.  Existing programs and eligibility 
for bike and trail construction in ISTEA should be preserved.
<P>
     Bicycle lanes are assumed to boost bike trip mode share. 
0.7% of all trips are currently made by bike.  The bike commute
rate is more than 3 times greater in areas where the ratio of 
bike lanes to arterial miles exceeds 0.35 than where it is below
0.35 (Goldsmith, 1993), and it is assumed that only 8 of the top
38 MSAs currently have bike lane to arterial miles ratios greater
than 0.35.  The effect of this policy is assumed to increase bike
mode share to 2.1% of all trips.  Every 1% increase in bike mode
share is assumed to reduce VMT by .2% (the average bike trip 
is much shorter than the average auto trip) (Goldsmith, 1993).<A

<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="IIIC4b">Fixed Route and On-Demand Transit</A>
<P>
Policy</STRONG>
<P>
This policy would make transit service - either fixed or flexible
route - available in all communities with populations above
200,000, only as land use and other infrastructural changes can
produce ridership for these services.
<P>
     "Supply push" transit strategies by themselves have shown
limited success in increasing ridership.  Our survey of the
literature on the impact of improving fixed-route public transit
and reducing wait time suggests that these two policies together
would reduce national VMT only minimally.  For this reason, these
policies should be phased-in as land use changes occur, as the
land use changes will produce most changes in transit ridership.
<P>
     Under this policy, fixed route public transit would be
available at 20 minute intervals within 0.25 miles of every
residence in urban core areas of cities with over 1 million
people.  This transit would be subsidized to be comparable to the
cost of driving.  On-demand transit service would be available
and competitively priced in all communities with populations 
above 200,000 with 1 hour advance reservation.  Transit services
would include subscription services, dial-a-ride, jitney
operations, expressway shuttles, or taxis.  These services would 
have access to and utilize the latest information technology
available.
<P>
<STRONG>
Estimated Impact on GHG Emissions from HALP Strategies
</STRONG>
     In an effort to evaluate the greenhouse gas reducing impacts
of combined land use and fixed route and on-demand transit
policies, a qualitative and quantitative approach was 
used.  A survey of all studies of any of these changes that have
already occurred around the US was undertaken, and projections of
reductions in VMT were made based on reported results to date.

<P>     Projected reductions in VMT were then used to calculate
GHG reductions, with some discounting to take doublecounting of
VMT reduction effects into consideration.
<P>
     It is presumed that reductions in these policies will be
phased in over time, as impacts from land use and lifestyle
changes are slower than those from "shock" impacts like sudden 
pricing changes or oil shortages.  Primarily these impacts are to
be seen from creating the density to allow walkable, mixed use
environments.  In an effort to prevent double counting 
we have not calculated an additional impact from creating a
pedestrian environment, assuming that the VMT/density
relationship would account for both.
<P>
     The effect of transit on VMT is inextricably linked to the
cluster of land use policies.  Improved transit service is
integral to the success of the land use policy cluster.  Moving
people out of their cars is accomplished both by supplying more
alternatives and by boosting demand for alternatives.  In this
case, better transit provision is the supply side of the 
equation, and policies to increase land use density are the
demand side.
<P>
     Transit ridership changes would flow from three factors:  1)
service expansions would increase coverage, 2) waiting time would
be reduced, and 3) prices would be comparable to driving.  Each
would have an impact on VMT and thus an impact on emissions.  The
emissions reduction would be offset by increased emissions from
transit service expansions, and the estimate is discounted
accordingly.  
<P>
     An integrated analysis of the greenhouse gas reductions from
land use changes, bicycle and pedestrian access, and improved
fixed-route and on-demand transit shows the following reductions:

<STRONG><A NAME="IIIC4c">Workplace Parking Subsidy
Reform</A></STRONG>
<P>
     Currently, a major federal subsidy for driving alone is the
employee tax exemption for employer-provided workplace parking. 
Employees do not have to pay taxes on such parking benefits of up
to $160 per month.  Technically, the subsidy is a tax-exempt
fringe benefit.  Employer-provided transit benefits are tax-
exempt only up to $60 per month.  No tax-exempt benefit at all is
available to cover other commuting costs incurred by workers who
walk, bike, or rideshare (such as shared vehicle costs, other
than workplace parking, in a carpool).  Neither can employers
offer taxable cash instead of the parking benefit.  Thus, the tax
code's current preferential treatment for workplace parking is an
incentive for commuters to drive to work alone rather than
carpool or use alternative commuting modes.
<P>
     Short of completely eliminating the workplace parking
subsidy, it could be substantially reformed by equalizing the
federal tax benefit for any commuting mode and making the benefit
contingent on an employers' offering a taxable cash allowance
instead of the benefit.  A unified tax exemption capped at $100
per month for any employer-provided commuter benefit, not just
parking, would create a level playing field among commuting modes
without added cost to the U.S. Treasury.  Commuting modes covered
would include transit, car or van pools, walking, bicycling, and
telecommuting, as well as parking.  Employers offering a parking
benefit would also be required to offer the value of the benefit
as taxable cash in lieu of a tax-exempt parking or other direct
receiptable commuting expense benefit.  A weaker version of this
policy was proposed in the 1993 Climate Change Action Plan. 
Maximum benefits and greater fairness are obtained by a broader
policy that fully levels the tax benefit playing field among
workplace commute modes for all employees and also makes any such
employer-provided parking benefit contingent upon employees also
being offered taxable cash equivalent to the fair local market
value of the parking subsidy.  It is this last provision that
will provide the greatest incentive for commuters to shift away
from solo driving.  In order to insure equity for low income
workers, families which qualify for the earned income tax credit
would be exempted from the tax implications of this policy.
<P>
     Because of the limited experience with changing the economic
signals faced by commuters, emissions reductions estimates for
this policy are quite uncertain.  In the October 1993 Climate
Change Action Plan, greenhouse gas emission reductions of 6.6 MMT
in 2000 were estimated for the version of this policy that was
somewhat more restrictive in scope, but was assumed to be applied
in combination with other measures to reduce VMT.  Other impact
estimates for even the broader version recommended here are much
lower (less than 1 MMT).  Here we use estimates developed by the
Analytic Support Group (ASG) by assuming a parking ramp-up of the
"opportunity cost" created by a less stringent version of this
reform.  The ASG also provided even higher estimates, but these
were found to be highly implausible by some Committee.  The
working estimates adopted here are emissions reductions of 6 MMT
in 2005, 11 MMT in 2015, and 22 MMT in 2025.  These estimates are
based on an assumption that the policy would suffice to create a
well-functioning "market" among workplace commute modes and
technical parameters of: (1) the policy affects only the
metropolitan share (61%) of overall commuting VMT; (2) 50% of
cars in metropolitan areas are receiving an employer-provided 
parking benefit; (3) a parking price elasticity of -0.16; (4) a
base marginal driving cost of $0.09 per mile, which includes fuel
plus tires and vehicle maintenance; and (5) the monthly 
"opportunity cost" of workplace parking ramps-up to $30 by 2005,
$50 by 2015, and $80 by 2025.
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="IIIC4d">Shifting The Cost of Driving</A>
<P>
Background
</STRONG>
<P>
     Federal Highway Statistics show that, in 1993, $87 billion
was spent by federal, state and local governments to build and
maintain roads.  A direct comparison of variable user fees 
collected (gas taxes and tolls) and expenditures reveals a
shortfall of $36 billion.  Of the $24 billion raised in gas taxes
at the federal level, however, only $13 billion is available for
road and highway expenditures (the remaining $11 billion is
dedicated to deficit reduction, mass transit, and the leaking
underground storage tank fund).  When the variable user fee
revenue which actually funds road and highway expenditures is
compared to annual outlays, the shortfall becomes $47 billion.    
<P>
     Further, up to $20 billion of road-related expenditures are
currently financed through property taxes and general
appropriations (i.e., income and sales taxes), and bond issue 
proceeds plus investment income at the state and local level add
nearly $13 billion.
<P>
<STRONG>
Proposed Policy
</STRONG>
<P>
     This policy begins to shift the costs of road building and
maintenance which road users do not now directly cover and it
turns these costs into a Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) 
fee.  This measure is revenue neutral and will not have any net
new costs to consumers.  Given the other policies proposed in
this report, a VMT charge of 1.22 cents per mile would 
close the gap and return to 1990 GHG levels by 2005.  This
approach would effectively convert some of the fixed costs of
driving (which are currently sustained by a range of non-
driving related taxes and fees) to marginal costs.  In addition,
this policy would reduce the demand for driving and increase
demand for more fuel efficient vehicles.  This policy could 
be further enhanced by creating a formula which incentivizes fuel
economy, i.e. VMT multiplied times the class of fuel efficiency
rating would establish the fee.
<P>
     Equity is our prime concern when developing a plan to
implement this proposal to shift state and local road subsidies
to cost-of-driving fees.  Equity concerns include the need 
to protect low income individuals, the need for provision for
alternatives to driving and the need for fair distribution of
revenues among state and local government to replace general 
funds currently spent on roads.  Therefore, it is essential to
involve fully state and local government representatives, as well
as low-income and community organizations, in the deliberations
that will be needed to develop a workable, effective, and
equitable proposal for this policy.
<P><STRONG>
GHG Emissions Reductions
</STRONG>
<P>
     To achieve the goal in 2005 the average cost-of-driving
shift would require a 1.22 cents per mile VMT fee, which is
equivalent to a $.28/gallon increase in fuel price by 2005.  
This VMT fee would ramp up to 1.22 cents by 2005 and remain fixed
thereafter.  The following estimates are based on running the GHG
accounting model developed for the Committee's use.

<P>
     Estimates of the social cost of VMT fees are not readily
available.  However, as with any incentive-based policy the fees
can be expected to be relatively cost-effective, though not 
as cost-effective as policies that target fuel economy as well as
VMT.  The fees also will produce auxiliary benefits from
reductions in urban air pollution.  The fees also will increase 
the efficiency of road use by making more of the road-related
cost of travel directly apparent.

Introduction:

This survey presents the results of a national survey of 1,200 registered 
voters on sustainable energy issues.  The study was conducted November 9 
- 14, 1996 immediately following the election and included questions on 
how respondents voted for President and Congress.  The margin of error is 
+/-2.9 percent.  The fifteen questions summarized here address:

	* 	the public's funding/budget cutting priorities for the 
		U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) research and development 
		programs;
	* 	public support for the U.S. Environmental Protection 
		Agency's Green Lights, Energy Star, and other voluntary "green
		programs;"
	*	future funding of the federal government's nuclear \
		pyroprocessing program;
	*	priorities among competing energy sources for federal tax 
		support;
	*    	support for federal tax incentives to promote renewable liquid
 		fuels, notably ethanol-	blended gasoline;
	*	whether the government should set stronger energy efficiency
		standards for appliances;
	*	the seriousness of the threat of global climate change caused
		by emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels;
	*	whether the United States should sign an international 
		agreement to set mandatory limits on the emission of 
		greenhouse gases;
	*	views on options for federal electric utility 
		restructuring legislation including:
			- mandating that electricity generators include 
			  renewables in their energy mix;
			- using a Renewable Portfolio Standard to promote 
			  increased use of renewables;
			- requiring utilities to invest in energy 
			  efficiency programs;
			- disposing of so-called "stranded nuclear 
			  assets;" and
			- establishing comparable environmental standards 
			  for all utility fossil-fueled plants.                            

DOE Research and Development Funding and Cutting Priorities:

Respondents were reminded about the budget cuts facing federal 
departments and agencies as Congress and the Administration try to reduce 
the deficit.  With this as a back drop, they were asked about five energy 
research and development (R&D) programs:  renewable energy (i.e., solar, 
wind, geothermal, biomass, and hydroelectric power); nuclear power; 
technologies to improve energy efficiency and conservation; fossil fuels 
such as oil, gasoline, and coal; and natural gas.  People were asked 
which of these programs should receive the highest priority for funding 
in DOE's research and development budget and which should be subject to 
funding cuts first.

Renewable energy programs receive the most public support for R&D funding 
priorities (34%) followed by energy efficiency and conservation (22%) for 
a combined total of 56%.  By comparison, only 10% cite natural gas as 
their first priority for federal R&D funding, followed by other fossil 
fuels (10%) and nuclear power (9%).  About 15% of the respondents did not 
select one of the offered responses.  Thus, nearly two-thirds (66%) of 
those who expressed a preference among the proffered choices (56% out of 
85%), select either DOE's renewable energy or energy efficiency R&D programs.

Support for renewable energy and energy efficiency programs cut across 
political party lines with 51.4% of Republicans, 62% of Democrats, 54% of 
Independents, and 57% of Reform Party members choosing these technologies 
as their top priorities.

When the topic shifts to budgetary cuts, the public focuses on two of 
these programs: nuclear power and fossil fuels.  Nearly a third of the 
respondents (31%) select nuclear power as the first R&D program that 
should be subject to budget cuts followed by fossil fuels (21%) for a 
combined total of 52%.  By comparison, 13% select renewable energy 
programs as the first that should be subject to budget cuts, followed by 
natural gas (6%) and energy efficiency (5%).  About a quarter of 
respondents (25%) did not express a preference among the proffered 
choices (which may indicate that a large segment of the public is not 
conversant with sustainable energy issues).  Thus, over two-thirds (69%) 
of respondents offering a preference among the proffered choices (52% out 
of 75%) recommend cutting funding for either nuclear power or fossil fuel 
programs.  

Again, these views were bipartisan and consistent regardless of the 
respondent's political affiliation with 48% of Republicans, 53% of 
Democrats, 53% of Independents, and 61% of Reform Party members choosing 
nuclear power and fossil fuels as their top priorities for making energy 
R&D budget cuts.

The public's funding and budget cutting priorities found in this survey 
are virtually the same as responses to identical questions asked in a 
December 1995 survey of 1,000 registered voters conducted by 
Research/Strategy/Management (R/S/M) for the Sustainable Energy 
Coalition.  In addition, the same ordering of priorities was found in a 
December 1994 R/S/M survey also conducted for the Sustainable Energy 
Coalition.  


U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's "Green Programs":

Respondents were informed of the "Green Lights," "Energy Star" and other 
voluntary EPA programs that encourage private industry to invest in 
cost-effective, energy-efficient improvements in their facilities.  They 
were asked whether funding for these programs should be increased, 
decreased, or maintained at current funding levels.

A plurality (45%) favor maintaining funding at the current level and 24% 
favored increased funding.  Thus, over two-thirds (69%) of respondents 
favor either maintaining or increasing funding levels for these programs 
while just slightly more than a quarter (27%) recommended cutting 
funding.  Only 4% of the respondents did not offer an opinion.

Again, support for these programs is bipartisan.  Nearly three-quarters 
(75%) of Democrats favor maintaining or increasing funding for these 
programs as do 62% of Republicans, 70% of Independents, and 66% of Reform 
Party members.

A similar question in a December 1995 R/S/M survey conducted for the 
Sustainable Energy Coalition found only 50% of respondents in favor of 
retaining funding for EPA's "green programs" while 41% favored cutting 
funding to help balance the federal budget.


Nuclear Pyroprocessing:

Respondents were presented with a lengthy question that outlined the 
arguments in favor of, and in opposition to, the federal government's 
nuclear pyroprocessing program which separates plutonium and uranium from 
the nuclear waste generated by the now-terminated "breeder" nuclear 
reactor system.  They were then asked whether Congress should continue to 
fund this activity.

A plurality of respondents (44%) were either strongly or somewhat opposed 
to Congress funding this program.  By comparison, 17% strongly felt 
Congress should fund this program and 23% somewhat believed this 
(combined total of 41%).

Nearly a sixth (15%) of the respondents did not offer an opinion possibly 
reflecting the complexity of the issue and the lack of familiarity with 
nuclear pyroprocessing by many voters.

Thus, among those respondents offering an opinion (44% out of 85%), a 
majority (52%) expressed some measure of opposition to continued funding 
of the program.

Opposition to continued funding was particularly strong among respondents 
identifying themselves as Republicans or Independents which may prove a 
factor in how the Republican Congress addresses the issue during the 
coming year.  Among those who voted for the Republican candidate in the 
recent congressional elections, 54% of those offering an opinion (or 47% 
out of 86%) are somewhat or strongly opposed to continued funding for the 
nuclear pyroprocessing program compared to only 16% strongly in support 
and 30% somewhat in support (combined total of 46%).  

Among Republican respondents offering an opinion, 54% (or 45% out of 84%) 
were opposed to continued funding as well as 54% of Independents (or 48% 
out of 88%) and 53% of Reform Party members (or 43% out of 80%).  
Democrats were evenly split on the issue (43% opposed and 43.0% in support).


Tax Incentives for Energy Development:

Respondents were asked which energy sources should receive federal tax 
incentives to attract private sector efforts to develop and promote 
them.  The question specifically focused on five energy resource 
categories:  renewable energy (i.e., solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, 
hydroelectric), energy efficiency and conservation, natural gas, other 
fossil fuels (i.e., coal, oil, gasoline), and nuclear power.

The responses closely parallel voters' priorities for federal funding of 
energy R&D programs.  More than a third (35%) of respondents chose 
renewable energy as their top priority for federal tax incentives 
followed by 17% for energy efficiency for a combined total of 52%.  By 
comparison, only 9% supported tax incentives for fossil fuels, 8% for 
natural gas, and 7% for nuclear power.  Nearly a quarter of the 
respondents either offered no opinion (16%) or felt that none of these 
technologies should be given tax incentives (9%).  

Thus, among those stating a preference, nearly two-thirds (62%) supported 
tax incentives for either renewable energy or energy efficiency efforts 
(i.e., 52% out of 84%).

Again, support for renewable energy and energy efficiency cuts across all 
party lines.  Among Republicans stating a preference, 63% favored 
sustainable energy technologies (48% out of 76%);  this was also true for 
73% of Democrats (54% out of 75%), for 74% of Independents (56% out of 
76%), and 75% of Reform Party members (57% out of 75%).

A majority of voters (57%) felt that tax reform should be a very high or 
top priority for the 1997 congressional agenda and 73% of respondents 
indicated that cutting taxes made a real, or at least some, difference in 
how they voted for Congress.  Nonetheless, support for sustainable energy 
tax incentives remains strong and may be increasing.  In response to an 
identical question asked by R/S/M in a December 1995 survey conducted for 
the Sustainable Energy Coalition, 61% of those expressing a preference 
(49% out of 80%) stated their support for renewable energy and energy 
efficiency tax incentives compared to 69% in November 1996. 


Ethanol and Renewable Liquid Fuels:

Respondents were informed that the United States currently imports more 
than half of its oil from foreign countries and that dependency will 
increase over the next 10 years.  They were then asked whether the U.S. 
should continue to give tax breaks or subsidies to oil companies as a way 
to ensure a steady supply of oil or instead redirect these tax breaks to 
encourage the increased use of domestically produced renewable fuels from 
biomass.  They were also asked whether they support or oppose continuing 
the 5.4 cent/gallon federal tax exemption for ethanol-blended gasoline.

By an overwhelming majority (83%), voters stated their preference for 
redirecting tax breaks to renewable fuels while only 10% felt they should 
continue to be given to oil companies.  This pattern was reflected by 
virtually identical margins across all party lines.  A small number of 
voters (4%) felt there should be no tax breaks given at all and 4% 
offered no opinion.  

Support for renewable fuels was particularly strong in the Midwest (85%) 
where ethanol-blended fuels are commonplace and in the Northeast (86%) 
which is particularly dependent on more costly home heating oil.  In 
addition, women favored a shift (87% compared to 78% for men).  

By margins almost as large, voters strongly or somewhat support (71%) 
continuing the federal tax exemption for ethanol-blended gasoline while 
only 20% oppose it strongly or somewhat.  Party affiliation appears to 
have no impact on the level of support with 70% of Republicans, 73% of 
Democrats, 68% of Independents, and 73% of Reform Party members strongly 
or somewhat supporting the tax exemption.  Perhaps not surprisingly, 
strong support (74%) was found among voters in the Midwest.  



Appliance Energy Efficiency Standards:

Respondents were asked whether the government should continue to 
strengthen efficiency standards for new refrigerators, clothes washers, 
hot water heaters, and fluorescent lighting equipment.  They were told 
the alternative was not to strengthen them any further because current 
standards are good enough and more efficient products would be more 
expensive to purchase.

Nearly two-thirds of voters (65%) strongly, or at least somewhat, favor 
strengthening appliance efficiency standards while only 29% somewhat or 
strongly oppose new standards.  While the strongest support comes from 
Democratic voters (78%), even a majority of Republicans (53%) expressed 
their support.  In addition, 62% of Independents and 69% of Reform Party 
members favor strengthening the standards.

Last year, the Republican Congress had imposed a one-year moratorium on 
the issuance of new appliance efficiency standards.  Yet, among those who 
voted in November 1996 for the Republican candidate for Congress, 56% 
favored strengthening the standards while only 40% expressed some degree 
of opposition.  Support also extends across all geographic regions with 
support particularly strong in the Northeast (72%), followed by the 
Midwest (65%), West Coast (65%), and South (62%).

Significantly, voter support for the government continuing to strengthen 
appliance efficiency standards comes at a time when a majority (56% vs. 
35%) feel -- when asked about the role of government in the economy -- 
that the government is generally doing too many things.

In response to a similar question asked in December 1995 by R/S/M in a 
survey conducted for the Sustainable Energy Coalition, only 48% of voters 
favored having the government continue to strengthen appliance efficiency 
standards while 46% preferred letting the market place determine new 
standards.


Climate Change:

Respondents were asked how serious they thought the threat of global 
climate change was from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gasoline.

Over seventy percent of voters (71%) view global climate change as a very 
serious (34%) or somewhat serious (37%) threat.  On the other hand, 17% 
of voters believe climate change to be not too serious a threat and only 
9% consider it to not be a threat at all.  

A very small number of respondents (3%) expressed no opinion on the issue 
-- the smallest percentage of undecided voters responding to the 15 
questions in this survey.  This suggests that global climate change is an 
issue with which most voters have some familiarity and a solid opinion.

For example, despite an aggressive public relations campaign during the 
past year by industry groups challenging whether the combustion of fossil 
fuels can lead to global climate change, public concern about this issue 
has not diminished.  In response to an identical question in a December 
1995 survey by R/S/M conducted for the Sustainable Energy Coalition, 71% 
of voters stated that they viewed global climate change to a serious 
threat -- virtually unchanged from the 71% who held this view in November 
1996.    

Concern about global climate change extends across all political party 
affiliations with Democrats (82%) and Reform Party members (83%) most 
likely to view it as a very serious or somewhat serious threat.  This 
view is shared by 72% of Independents and 56% of Republicans.  

Among voters who cast their ballots for President Clinton in November 
1996, four out of five voters (80%) agreed that global climate change was 
somewhat or very serious.  This may be significant as the Administration 
assesses how aggressively it wants to pursue domestic options to address 
climate change as well as an international agreement to control 
greenhouse gas emissions.

Even among respondents who voted for a Republican candidate in the recent 
congressional elections, 54% said that climate change was a serious 
threat while only 26% felt it was not too serious and 16% felt it was not 
a threat at all.  Again, this may be significant because it may be a 
Republican Congress that will have to ultimately approve any 
international treaty to limit greenhouse gas emissions and subsequent 
implementing legislation.

Of particular note, women were significantly more likely to view climate 
change as a serious threat (77% compared to 62% for men).  And, perhaps 
less surprisingly, among voters who believe that the environment should 
be a congressional priority in 1997, 85% view global climate change as a 
serious threat.


International Climate Change Agreement:

Respondents were told that the United States is considering signing an 
international agreement by the end of 1997 that would set a legally 
binding deadline for reducing a specified amount of greenhouse gases, 
such as carbon dioxide.  After being presented with some of the arguments 
in favor of, and opposed to, signing such an agreement, voters were asked 
whether or not they favored the United States signing such an agreement.

A plurality, approximately half (50%), of voters are either strongly 
(25%) or somewhat (24%) in favor of signing such a treaty.  A fifth of 
voters (20%) are somewhat opposed while only 21% strongly oppose signing 
a treaty (for a combined total of 41%).  Nearly a tenth (10%) of 
respondents did not offer an opinion.  Thus, among those offering an 
opinion, 55% said they strongly or somewhat favor signing a treaty (i.e., 
50% out of 90%).

Support is strongest among Democratic (63%), Reform Party (62%), and 
Independent (51%) voters.  Among Republicans, 35% strongly or somewhat 
favor signing an agreement while 26% are somewhat opposed and 32% are 
strongly opposed.

However, the level of support rises to nearly two-thirds (66%) among 
voters who cast their ballot in the November 1996 election for President 
Clinton whose Administration will be taking the lead on negotiating a 
treaty throughout the coming year.  Furthermore, voters who cite the 
environment as a factor that influenced their vote for president favor 
signing an agreement by 71%.  Likewise, among those who view the 
environment as a priority for Congress in 1997, more than two-thirds 
(67%) favor signing an agreement.


Electric Utility Restructuring - Renewable Energy:

Respondents were told that Congress is considering options to change the 
way the electric utility industry operates to increase customer choice 
somewhat akin to how one selects a long-distance telephone carrier.  
However, as with any significant change of this type, there are 
trade-offs involved including the possibility that renewable energy 
sources would be a competitive disadvantage and their use would decline.  

Respondents were then asked two questions.  The first was whether 
Congress should adopt policies to require electricity companies to use 
renewable energy or alternatively leave the decision to the companies 
themselves.  The second was whether favored a specific policy, also known 
as a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), whereby electricity suppliers 
would be required to produce some of their electricity, for example about 
5 percent, from renewables even if this might raise the average 
consumer's electricity bill up to $1.00 per month.

A clear majority (53%) of voters favor Congress requiring electricity 
companies to use renewable energy while 44% would leave the choice up to 
the companies' discretion; 4% of voters expressed no opinion.  The 
strongest support for a congressional mandate was expressed by members of 
the Reform Party (78%) followed by Democrats (62%) and Independents (57%) 
for a combined average of 62%.  Only Republicans favored leaving the 
matter to the discretion of the electricity companies (57%) rather than 
resorting to a congressional mandate (39%).

While at least a plurality of voters in all geographic regions of the 
country agree that Congress should adopt policies to require electric 
companies to use renewable energy, support was particularly strong in the 
Midwest (60%).  Moreover, among voters who view the environment as a 
priority for Congress in 1997, nearly two-thirds (64%) favor a 
congressional mandate.

Voters overall expressed even stronger support for a Renewable Portfolio 
Standard (RPS) with 57% favoring Congress adopting such a requirement 
either strongly (27%) or somewhat (30%).  Only a fifth of voters (21%) 
strongly oppose the RPS proposal while another 17% are somewhat opposed 
(for a combined total of 38%).  

RPS supporters outnumber opponents regardless of political party 
affiliation.  Nearly three-quarters of Reform Party members (74%) favor 
an RPS requirement as do 65% of Democrats, 53% of Independents.  Among 
Republican voters, 48% support the RPS approach compared to 47% who 
oppose it somewhat or strongly.  Moreover, a majority (51%) of voters who 
supported the Republican candidate for Congress in the November 1996 
election favor an RPS requirement while 45% oppose it.  Two-thirds of 
voters (67%) who supported the Democratic candidate for Congress favor 
the RPS requirement.  

The public's support for Congress requiring electricity companies to use 
renewables is all the more notable given that a majority of voters (56%) 
believe the government is trying to do too many things with the economy 
that should be left to business and individuals compared to only 35% who 
believe the government should do more.


Electric Utility Restructuring - Energy Efficiency:

Respondents were advised that changes in how the utility industry 
operates could lead to cutbacks or the elimination of programs, such as 
home energy audits and rebates on energy efficient products, that help to 
improve consumers' energy efficiency.  They were asked whether they favor 
requiring utilities to invest in energy efficiency programs or leaving 
the decision to the utilities to offer energy efficiency programs.

By a large majority (69%), voters favor requiring utilities to invest in 
energy efficiency programs either strongly (37%) or at least somewhat 
(32%).  Only 10% of voters strongly oppose such a requirement while 16% 
are somewhat opposed (for a combined total of 26%).

Support for mandatory utility investments in energy efficiency extends 
across all party lines with 78% of Reform Party members, 76% of 
Democrats, 72% of Independents, and 60% of Republicans.  Even among 
voters who define themselves as being "somewhat conservative," a strong 
majority (55%) favors this approach.

Voters who believe the environment should be a top congressional priority 
in 1997 are overwhelmingly (84%) in support of this requirement as well 
as those who list the environment as a reason that influenced their 
recent vote for president (78%).
 

Electric Utility Restructuring - Stranded Nuclear Assets:

Respondents were then informed that another consequence of changing how 
electric utilities operate is that some of the existing nuclear power 
plants may not be economically competitive but will still have 
construction and operating debts to pay off.  They were asked who should 
be most responsible for paying these debts: utilities and shareholders, 
consumers, or the general public through taxes.

By a lopsided margin (70%), voters felt that utilities and their 
shareholders should be most responsible for paying the debt on existing 
nuclear power plants that may not be able to compete in a restructured 
utility market.  Only 14% thought that the consumers served by these 
utilities should pay while 8% indicated that the general public should 
pay through their taxes.  A small number (3%) of respondents offered that 
the debt should be equally shared by all three groups while 6% did not 
offer an opinion.

Since this is an issue that is likely to be before the Republican 
Congress in 1997, it is notable that two-thirds (67%) of those who voted 
for the Republican candidate in the recent congressional elections felt 
that utilities and shareholders should bear responsibility for nuclear 
plant debts.

Similarly, this view prevailed strongly across all party lines with 76% 
of Reform Party members, 71% of Democrats, 69% of Independents, and 68% 
of Republicans agreeing that nuclear plant debts should be borne by 
utilities and their shareholders.


Electric Utility Restructuring - Environmental Impacts:

Finally, respondents were told that some people fear that under utility 
deregulation, fossil fuel power plants which are subject to weaker 
environmental standards because of their age and location could gain a 
competitive advantage and increase their output and resulting emissions.  
They were then asked whether they believe the standards for the 
less-regulated plants are good enough and should not be made higher 
because that could reduce the economic benefits of competition.  As an 
alternative, they were asked whether strong environmental standards 
should be applied equally to all power plants.

A majority of voters (53%) strongly favor strong environmental standards 
that would apply equally to all power plants while another 27% somewhat 
favor such standards for a combined total of 80%.  Only 15% of voters 
somewhat or strongly oppose such standards.

This view is shared by people of all political stripe:  Reform Party 
(85%), Democratic (85%), Independents (80%), and Republicans (74%).  Even 
voters who define themselves as very conservative favor this view by 68%.

<P>
In all cases "+" represents the safe and sustainable energy
policy vote or position; "-" represents opposition to the safe

<HR>
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="hr1020cosp">HR1020 Cosponsorship</A></STRONG> --
Cosponsorship in
the 104th
Congress of H.R. 1020,
the "Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1995."  Cosponsorship is 
marked with a (-).  Because Representatives who did not cosponsor the 
legislation may not oppose it, a (+) is not given for this bill.<P>
<EM>Reason for listing:</EM><BR>
H.R. 1020 would slash
environmental standards, preempt state law, and force the opening
of an unnecessary "interim" storage facility for high-level
nuclear
waste in Nevada, resulting in the unprecedented transportation of
high-level waste throughout the nation despite the absence of a
long-term plan for disposition.  
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="texasllw">Texas Low-Level Waste
Compact</A></STRONG> --
Vote to
suspend House rules
and pass H.R. 558, the
"Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact."  On
September 19, 1995, the compact failed by a vote of 176-243.  A
NO vote is marked with a (+), a YES vote with a 
(-).  "A" indicates the Representative did
not vote; "N" indicates that the Representative was not yet
serving in Congress when the vote was taken.
<P>
<EM>Reason for listing:</EM><BR>
Passage of
the Compact would allow the placement of a nuclear waste dump in
a seismically active area in Texas near the Mexican border.  The
dump's location appears to target a poor, minority community
and threatens the Rio Grande river.
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="effstand95">New Energy Efficiency
Standards</A></STRONG> --
Vote
on an
amendment by
Rep. Parker (R-MS) to the
1996 Interior Appropriations bill (H.R. 1977) to eliminate $12.7
million in funding for DOE's Codes and Standards Program and
prohibit this office from conducting any new rulemakings on
appliance efficiency standards and building codes.  On July 18,
1995, the amendment passed by a 262-164 vote.  A NO vote is
marked with a (+), a YES vote with a (-).  "A" indicates the 
Representative did not vote; "N" indicates that the Representative was 
not yet serving in Congress when the vote was taken.
<P> 
<EM>Reason  for 
listing:</EM><BR> 
Appliance efficiency standards adopted to date will save
consumers $132 billion net over the life of the products covered
and avoid the need for 58,000 Megawatts (MW) of new capacity, or
the equivalent of more than 100 nuclear or coal-fired plants. 
Freezing ongoing and future rulemakings could cost consumers
over $100 billion in lost energy savings over the next
30 years and create the need for an additional 37,300 MW of new
capacity, or the equivalent of 75 coal or nuclear plants by the
year 2015.

<STRONG><A NAME="renew95">Restore Renewable Energy
Funding</A></STRONG> --
Vote on
an amendment by Reps.
Klug (R-WI), Schaefer
(R-CO), Fazio (D-CA), Markey (D-MA) and Thurman (D-FL) to the
1996 Energy & Water Appropriations bill to restore $44.7 million
to renewable energy programs authorized by the Energy Policy Act
of 1992.   On July 12, 1995, the amendment passed by a 214-208
vote.  A YES vote is marked with a (+), a NO vote with a (-).
"A" indicates the Representative did not vote; "N" indicates that the 
Representative was not yet serving in Congress when the vote was taken.
<P>
<EM>Reason for listing:</EM><BR>
Even after passage of the amendment, the House Energy and Water
Appropriations bill cut spending on renewable energy
programs by 32%, from $393.6 million in 1995 to $266.5 million in
1996.  Nuclear fission would only be reduced by 18%, from
$288.3 million in 1995 to $235.7 million in 1996.  The level of
these cuts contrasts with the results of a recent public opinion
survey performed by Republican pollster Vince Breglio.  The poll
of 1,000 registered voters found that when asked which two energy
programs should receive cuts first, 61% chose nuclear energy, 59%
said oil and coal, 23% said natural gas, 16% identified renewable
energy and 16% chose energy efficiency.  When asked which two
programs should receive the highest priority for continued
funding, 64% cited renewable energy, 49% chose energy efficiency,
35% said natural gas, 21% picked nuclear power and 19% identified
oil and coal.

Program</A></STRONG>
-- Vote on
an amendment by Rep. Obey
(D-WI) to the 1996
Energy & Water Appropriations bill to eliminate $40 million in
funding for the Advanced Light Water Reactor program.  On July
12, 1995, the amendment failed by a 191-227 vote.  A YES vote is
marked with a (+), a NO vote with a (-).  "A" indicates the 
Representative did not vote; "N" indicates that the Representative was 
not yet serving in Congress when the vote was taken.
<P>
<EM>Reason for listing:</EM><BR>
The Advanced Light Water Reactor program has provided over $275 
million since 1992 to corporate
giants like General Electric and Westinghouse for the development
of evolutionary light water reactors designed primarily for
export.  In a poll of
electric utility executives taken in 1994, nearly 72% of
respondents said that their company would never consider ordering
another nuclear power plant, yet Congress insists on pouring more
money into nuclear technology.

was terminated by Congress in 1994 and could be used to revive
breeder reactor research in the future.  The reprocessing
technology will increase DOE's radioactive waste inventory and
has no support from DOE's own office of Environmental Management.
 A National Academy of Sciences study on plutonium disposition
raises serious questions about the utility of continuing this
program and states that "[pyroprocessing] has several
disadvantages that the panel believes effectively rule it out as
a serious competitor for the near-term plutonium disposition
mission."

<STRONG><A NAME="gtmhr95">Terminate the Gas Reactor
(1995)</A></STRONG> --
Vote on
an
amendment by Reps.
Klug (R-WI), Foley
(R-FL), Obey (D-WI) and Luther (D-MN) to the 1996 Energy & Water
Appropriations bill (H.R. 1905) to eliminate $20 million in
funding for the Gas-Turbine Modular Helium Reactor (GT-MHR).  On
July 11,
1995, the amendment was passed by a 306-121 vote.  A YES vote is
marked with a (+), a NO vote with a (-).  "A" indicates the 
Representative did not vote; "N" indicates that the Representative was 
not yet serving in Congress when the vote was taken.
<P>
<EM>Reason for listing:</EM><BR>
The federal government has already spent over $900 million
on gas-cooled reactor technology, despite a
complete lack of interest from electric utilities.  The National 
Academy of Sciences, in a 1992 report,
recommended that the government stop supporting the program and
concluded in a 1994 report that the technology would not be a
feasible way of disposing of excess weapons plutonium.  The 
GT-MHR also made the top ten list of wasteful and
environmentally destructive programs in the 
"Green Scissors" report published by an alliance of
environmental, taxpayer and consumer organizations including
Friends of the Earth, Public Citizen and the National Taxpayers
Union. Terminating the GT-MHR will save $20 million in FY'96 and
$2.6 billion in coming years.

Vote
on an amendment by
Reps. Markey (D-MA), Dellums (D-CA), Vucanovich (R-NV), and
Ensign (R-NV) to the 1996 Defense Authorization bill to strip $50
million in funding for the construction of a "triple play"
reactor to generate electricity, produce tritium and fission
weapons-grade plutonium.  The reactor would be built by Asea
Brown Boveri/Combustion Engineering at the Savannah River site. 
On June 15, 1995, the amendment passed by a 214-208 vote.  A YES

Representative did not vote; "N" indicates that the Representative was 
not yet serving in Congress when the vote was taken.
<P>
<EM>Reason for listing:</EM><BR>
The amendment both saves taxpayer dollars, by cutting the funding
for a tritium source to  
$50 million, and preserves the public's right to be part of the

funding until the PEIS for Tritium has been completed and there 
have been Congressional hearings on the subject.

Renewable energy and efficiency programs have received about 18%
of all federal energy R&D funding since 1950 (in real terms)
while nuclear fission, fusion, and fossil energy programs
benefitted from the bulk of R&D monies and generous tax breaks. 
Public opinion polls show strong support for renewable energy and
efficiency programs while respondents consistently call for
cutting nuclear and fossil programs first.  Shifting $1 billion
away from other DOE programs into sustainable energy R&D would
help to quicken the deployment of emerging technologies that
provide a wide array of economic and environmental benefits.

<A NAME="anwr95">Preserve the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</A>
<P>
<STRONG>Description of Vote:</STRONG> -- Amendment by Senator
William Roth (R-DE) to the Budget Reconciliation bill to strip
provisions allowing oil and gas exploration and drilling in the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  The amendment, offered on
October 27, 1995, was defeated on a 48-51 vote.  A YES vote is
marked with a (+), a NO vote with a (-).  "A" indicates the
Senator did not vote; "N" indicates that the Senator was not yet
serving in the Senate when the vote was taken.
<P>
<EM>Reason for listing:</EM><BR>
The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), located in Alaska's
northeast corner, is the only place in the United States where
the full range of sub-Arctic and Arctic ecosystems are protected
in one unbroken continuum.  ANWR's coastal plain is important to
Beafort Sea polar bears; millions of migratory sea birds, song
birds and waterfowl from six continents; and the 152,000 member
Porcupine River caribou herd.  Biologists predict significant
impacts on populations of caribou, muskoxen, polar bears, brown
bears, wolves, wolverines, and numerous species of migratory
birds if oil and gas drilling on the coastal plain goes forward. 
The oil industry, which already has access to over 90% of the
Arctic coastline, plans to export oil extracted from ANWR to East
Asian nations, which will do nothing to alleviate America's
dependence on imported oil.  Instead of opening up pristine
wildlife areas for oil drilling, Congress should cut oil
consumption by increasing fuel economy standards for automobiles
and light trucks.
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="gtmhr95">Terminate the Gas Reactor
(1995)</A></STRONG> --
Vote on an amendment by Sens. Bumpers (D-AR), Inhofe (R-OK), and
Kerry (D-MA) to the 1996 Energy & Water
Appropriations bill (H.R. 1905) to eliminate funding for the
Gas-Turbine Modular Helium Reactor (GT-MHR).  On
August 1,
1995, the amendment was passed by a 62-38 vote.  A YES vote is
marked with a (+), a NO vote with a (-).  "A" indicates the
Senator did not vote; "N" indicates that the Senator was not yet
serving in the Senate when the vote was taken.
<P>
<EM>Reason for listing</EM><BR>
The federal government has already spent over $900 million
on gas-cooled reactor technology, despite a
complete lack of interest from electric utilities.  The National 
Academy of Sciences, in a 1992 report,
recommended that the government stop supporting the program and
concluded in a 1994 report that the technology would not be a
feasible way of disposing of excess weapons plutonium.  The 
GT-MHR also made the top ten list of wasteful and
environmentally destructive programs in the 
"Green Scissors" report published by an alliance of
environmental, taxpayer and consumer organizations including
Friends of the Earth, Public Citizen and the National Taxpayers
Union. Terminating the GT-MHR will save $20 million in FY'96 and
$2.6 billion in coming years.
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="almr94">Terminate the Advanced Liquid Metal
Reactor
(1994)</A></STRONG> -- Vote on a
motion by Sen. Johnston (D-LA) to table (kill) an amendment by
Sens. Bumpers (D-AR), Gregg (R-NH), and Kerry (D-MA) to the FY
1995 Energy and Water Appropriations bill that would terminate
the Advanced Liquid Metal Reactor.  On June 30, 1994, the motion
passed 52-46.  A NO vote is marked with a (+), a YES vote with a
(-).  "A" indicates the Senator did not vote; "N" indicates that
the Senator was not yet serving in the Senate when the vote was
taken.<P>
<EM>Reason for listing</EM><BR>
The National Academy of
Sciences, the Office of Technology Assessment and the General
Accounting Office have all released studies which rejected the
feasibility of the ALMR.  Both
President Clinton and Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary asked 
Congress to terminate the ALMR program because it undermines U.S.
policy on nuclear weapons proliferation. 
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="hark_jeff">Restore Renewable Energy
Funding</A></STRONG> --
Vote on motion by Sen. Johnston (D-LA) to table (kill) an
amendment to the FY 1995 Energy and Water Appropriations bill by
Sens. Harkin (D-IA) and Jeffords (R-VT) that would have added $33
million to renewable energy programs by decreasing spending for
nuclear weapons.  On June 30, 1994, Johnston's motion passed 53-
45.  A NO vote is marked with a (+), a YES vote with a (-).  "A"
indicates the Senator did not vote; "N" indicates that the
Senator was not yet serving in the Senate when the vote was
taken.
<P>
<EM>Reason for listing:</EM><BR>
Renewable energy and efficiency programs have received about 18%
of all federal energy R&D funding since 1950 (in real terms)
while nuclear fission, fusion, and fossil energy programs
benefitted from the bulk of R&D monies and generous tax breaks. 
Public opinion polls show strong support for renewable energy
programs while respondents consistently call for
cutting nuclear and fossil programs first.  Shifting funds
into sustainable energy R&D would help to quicken the deployment
of emerging technologies that provide a wide array of economic
and environmental benefits.
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="gtmhr93">Terminate the Gas Reactor
(1993)</A></STRONG> -- Vote on a motion by Sen. Johnston (D-LA)
to table (kill) an amendment by Sen. Bradley (D-NJ) to the FY
1994 Energy and Water Appropriations bill to strip $22 million
from the Gas Turbine Modular Helium Reactor (GT-MHR).  On
September 30, 1993 the Johnston motion failed 41-58.  A NO vote
is marked with a (+), a YES vote is marked with a (-).  "A"
indicates the Senator did not vote; "N" indicates that the
Senator was not yet serving in the Senate when the vote was
taken.<P>
<EM>Reason for listing:</EM><BR>
The federal government has already spent over $900 million
on gas-cooled reactor technology, despite a
complete lack of interest from electric utilities.  The National 
Academy of Sciences, in a 1992 report,
recommended that the government stop supporting such technology.
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="nukelic">Allow Hearings on Reactor
Safety</A></STRONG> -- Vote on a motion by Sen. Johnston (D-LA)
to table (kill) an amendment by Sens. Graham (D-FL) and Fowler
(D-GA) that would have preserved citizens' rights to hearings on
nuclear reactor safety issues that arose after reactor
construction.  The motion passed 52-43 on February 6, 1992. A NO
vote is marked with a (+), a YES vote with a (-).  "A" indicates
the Senator did not vote; "N" indicates that the Senator was not
yet serving in the Senate when the vote was taken.
<P><EM>Reason for listing:</EM><BR>
Because the larger energy bill allowed for "one-step" licensing
of nuclear reactors, failure to adopt the amendment resulted in
eliminating citizens' rights to public hearings
on new safety issues after reactor construction is
authorized.

Survey of Presidential Candidates Finds Sharp Differences 
Among Republicans and With President Clinton 
on Environmental Protection and Energy Policy Issues

Washington, D.C. -- Responses from President Clinton and all of
the major Republican candidates to a "Presidential Candidates
Environmental and Energy Issues Questionnaire" released today
reflect a range of views not only between President Clinton and
the candidates for the Republican nomination but among the
Republican candidates themselves.  

     The questionnaire was prepared and circulated by the Energy
America Education Fund, a non-partisan, non-profit New Hampshire
organization.  Written responses to its 16-question survey were
obtained over the past four weeks from President Bill Clinton,
Senators Bob Dole (KS), Phil Gramm (TX), and Richard Lugar (IN),
Congressman Robert Dornan (CA), former governor Lamar Alexander
(TN), businessmen Steve Forbes and Morry Taylor, and media
commentators Patrick Buchanan and Alan Keyes.    

     While President Clinton generally staked out stronger
pro-environment positions in response to most questions than his
would-be Republican challengers, numerous public opinion surveys
suggest that all the candidates may be out of step with voters on
key environmental and energy policy issues -- to their potential
detriment.  

     For example, a survey conducted last month by
Research/Strategy/Management, a Republican polling firm, for the
Sustainable Energy Budget Coalition found that nearly 60 percent
of voters said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate
who shares their energy priorities.  Furthermore, they
overwhelmingly favor continuing federal support for renewable
energy and energy efficiency programs while reducing support for
conventional energy sources such as nuclear, coal, and oil.  Most
of the responses ran counter to these preferences. 

     For instance, only Clinton and Lugar objected to the 25
percent cut in FY'96 funding approved by Congress for the U.S.
Department of Energy's (DOE) energy efficiency and renewable
energy programs while the other Republican candidates indicated
their support for reducing those budgets.  Lugar, though, felt
"DOE programs must be eligible to take some cuts."  Forbes noted
that "additional cuts may be needed so I have not yet established
a funding level."

     When asked whether they support abolishing DOE itself, the
candidates split along party lines with most of the Republicans
wanting to close it down; Lugar, however, is opposed to
abolishing it "at this time" but could consider the option if it
were "part of a general reorganization of the Executive Branch." 
Clinton, citing an Administration plan to reduce DOE costs by $10
billion by 2000, supports preserving essential DOE functions
"such as research and development, efficiency programs, and
critical defense programs."  

     However, possibly recognizing its popularity among New
Hampshire voters particularly during the recent cold wave and
blizzards, most of the Republican candidates as well as Clinton
expressed support for funding DOE's Weatherization Assistance
Program (WAP) as well as the Health and Human Services
Department's Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). 
Alexander, Keyes, and Dornan, though, endorsed proposed cuts of
40 percent in funding for these programs.  Dole said that funding
levels depend on other competing priorities and the need to
balance the budget as well as noted that "the states should have
more say" have these resources are used.  Forbes has "established
no specific funding level" while Buchanan did not share his views
on this issue.

     Divisions among the Republicans were evident when asked
whether they would support a 35 percent cut in the Environmental
Protection Agency's (EPA) FY'96 budget as earlier approved by the
U.S. House of Representatives.  Taylor, Buchanan, and Dornan all
support such a cut.  Gramm indicated that EPA would be
hard-pressed to justify not having its budget cut.  Lugar and
Dole oppose a 35% cut but are willing to support smaller
reductions as approved by the U.S. Senate while Alexander would
retarget at least some funding to the states "to keep their
drinking water clean."  Clinton "is strongly opposed to cuts of
this magnitude" in EPA's budget.  Keyes added that
"appropriations riders were the only way to discipline EPA after
the environmental establishment blocked reauthorization of major
environmental bills."  Again, Forbes noted that he has
"established no specific funding level."

     A split also exists regarding new appliance efficiency
standards.  Lugar and Taylor both expressed support for such
standards as did Clinton who maintains that they "have saved
consumers billions of dollars in the past 10 years."  Alexander
noted that "they do need to be reformed."  Senators Gramm and
Dole indicated that the marketplace, rather than the federal
government, should dictate efficiency standards.  Dornan, Forbes,
and Keyes favor the phase-out of new standards; and Buchanan
offered no response.

     Alexander, Buchanan, Dornan, Forbes, and Taylor explicitly
support the construction of new nuclear plants in this country
while Lugar "would not rule out construction if a particular
plant is economical and safe."  Dole expresses a similar view
noting that the problem of disposing of nuclear waste "needs to
be resolved."  Gramm would leave nuclear construction decisions
to the states and localities while continuing federal safety
standards.  Keyes support new plant construction provided they
"are not built with tax dollars."  Clinton favors "research and
development funding to help develop more cost-effective nuclear
plant designs" while letting "the market and the public choose
the technology and fuels for future electricity generation -- not
the government."

     Alexander, Dornan, Taylor, and Lugar ("if needed to avoid
premature licensing of a permanent storage facility") support
establishing an interim storage facility for high-level waste in
Nevada.  Buchanan and Keyes offered no comment while Forbes said
that he was "undecided pending further study.  Gramm said the
federal government must "work closely with individual states to
best determine the future of interim storage issues."  Dole
favors building such a facility but would leave "determinations
regarding the siting of that facility to the legislative
process."  Clinton "opposes building anywhere a temporary storage
facility for high-level waste until scientific investigation on a
permanent disposal site is farther along." 

     The proposed transfer of federal land for the proposed Ward
Valley, California "low-level" nuclear waste facility is
generally supported by all the candidates other than Buchanan and
Taylor who offered no comment and Forbes who, again, was
"undecided pending further study."  Dole and Lugar pointed to
earlier scientific studies that support opening the site. 
Clinton, who earlier vetoed a measure he claimed lacked "any
binding commitments for public safeguards" said his support is
conditioned on "the proper health and safety standards [being] in
place" while Alexander wants the project to be "scientifically
and environmentally sound."

     All the Republican candidates favor opening the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil exploration and drilling. 
Dole supports development on ANWR's Coastal Plain, where only "a
small portion" would be affected "because it can be done safely
and responsibly without damage to the environment," while Lugar
assumes that "strict regulations and advanced technology will
protect wildlife."  Alexander believes "the technology now exists
to begin limited oil and gas exploration in a way that would be
safe for the environment."  Clinton is opposed noting that the
region "is a rare, pristine wilderness that should be preserved
for future generations [and] there is more oil in energy
efficiency."

     On the other hand, only Taylor supports raising fuel
efficiency standards for new cars and light trucks.  Clinton
prefers pursuing a partnership with the domestic auto industry
"to develop a new generation of high-performance, affordable
vehicles [that are] up to three times more fuel efficient." 
Keyes maintains that "CAFE kills 2,000 - 4,000 people a year by
making larger, safer cars less affordable."  Dole would rely on
"market-based mechanisms to get the really inefficient and
polluting cars off the road."  Both he and Taylor expressed
support for increased use of ethanol as a transportation fuel.

     Clinton and Dornan report that they support cutting
"greenhouse gas" emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. 
Lugar notes that he supported the 1992 Climate Change Convention
that called for the stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions
while Dole supports former President Bush's "commitment
to prepare a plan with the objective of returning  U.S.
greenhouse gas levels in the year 2000 to 1990 levels through
voluntary measures."  Alexander acknowledges that this is "a
serious issue" but opposes acting unless done "in conjunction
with other countries" while Gramm would rely on only
"market-driven energy efficiency" and would "oppose artificial
government mandates."  Forbes "question[s] the need for
restricting the United States' ability to create jobs for our
people based on a global warming theory which is unproven." 
Keyes is opposed while Buchanan and Taylor did not respond.

     All the candidates say they support applying cost/benefit
tests to all new and existing federal environmental and energy
regulation although Clinton would oppose its use if it "would
cause undue delay or litigation or would roll back health,
safety, and environmental protection."  Lugar favors its use
"to achieve strict environmental standards a reasonable cost." 
Gramm would subject "all regulatory legislation to risk
assessment or cost-benefit studies."  Dole wants to "emphasize
sound science, prioritize our efforts, be careful of pursuing
small risks at great costs, and understand that spending more to
chase slight or sensational risks means less state, local and
individual resources are available to meet other health or
societal needs."

     Dornan, Buchanan, Taylor, and Keyes (who favors "voluntary,
incentive-based conservation") oppose reauthorization and strict
enforcement of the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  Forbes is also
opposed "unless common sense amendments are adopted to stop
prosecution of farmers who run over endangered rats while plowing
their fields and similar ridiculous situations."  Gramm would
"support a rational, science-based law which respects private
property and individual jobs."  Noting his experience with the
snail darter, Alexander favors reforming the law so that is "less
onerous to property owners, gives more incentives to property
owners to protect endangered species, but still retains federal
protection of endangered species and their habitats."  Dole also
calls for ESA's reform charging that the law "has effectively
placed the judiciary in charge of commerce and land management in
significant portions of the West and Northwest."  Lugar favors
reauthorization noting that "the scope of the ESA needs
clarification" while Clinton supports a "strong ESA that protects
wildlife and provides more flexibility to landowners and more
involvement for the states." 

     All the Republicans, other than Lugar, support federal
"takings" legislation that would require payment if federal
environmental regulations reduce property values.  Lugar reports
that he is "skeptical that Congress should try to improve upon
the work of the courts in defining a taking or determining what
is just compensation."  Similarly, Clinton believes that proposed
"takings" legislation "goes beyond Constitutional protections; it
would cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars and weaken
safeguards for public health, safety, and the environment."

     All the Republicans as well as Clinton say they want the
government to receive a fair market return for publicly owned
minerals extracted by private mining companies on federal land. 
Gramm and Lugar expressly called for an increase in the amount
charged to mining companies using federal lands.  While saying he
supports reform of "out-dated mining laws," Dole also "opposes
efforts that would put miners and others in related activities
out of work, severely impact the economy in our Western states
and actually decrease Federal revenues."  Forbes "support[s] the
principle of a fair market return but have endorsed no specific
plan as of now."  Keyes, though, recommends that market value be
"determined by some kind of auction or competitive bidding
process."

     Finally, all of the Republican candidates other than
Buchanan (who did not respond) support repealing the 1935 Public
Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA).  Dole calls PUHCA "an
outdated statute that no longer provides benefits to consumers or
investors and should be repealed" while Lugar conditions his
support for repeal on whether "this would eliminate duplicative
regulation."  Clinton, however, opposes repeal because the law
"still serves as an important safeguard for consumers [but] as
the electric utility industry becomes more competitive, the
Administration will assess the prospects for undertaking
statutory reforms of PUHCA."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE              CONTACT:  Bill Magavern
Wednesday, February 7, 1996                  202-546-4996</PRE>
<P>
<STRONG><CENTER>
STATEMENT OF BILL MAGAVERN<BR>
DIRECTOR, PUBLIC CITIZEN'S CRITICAL MASS ENERGY PROJECT,<BR>
ON  ENERGY AMERICA'S PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES QUESTIONNAIRE</STRONG>
</CENTER>
<P>
     The candidates' positions on several sustainable energy
issues put them closer to the polluting special interests than to
the voters. While the American people have repeatedly called for
movement away from dirty nuclear and fossil fuels toward cleaner
renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies, the
politicians continue to side with big corporate interests who are
blocking change. 
<P>
     The major candidates oppose a fuel-saving 45 miles per
gallon standard for motor vehicles, which would save Americans
billions of dollars while reducing air pollution. In 1992, Bill
Clinton supported raising Corporate Average Fuel Economy
standards from 27.5 mpg to 45 mpg. In 1996, he has flip-flopped
and joined the leading Republicans and General Motors, Ford and
Chrysler in opposing 45 mpg.
<P>
     The Democratic and Republican contenders also side with the
nuclear industry by backing, to varying degrees, construction of
more nuclear power plants and a nuclear waste dump in California,
both of which have been rejected by large majorities in public
opinion polls. In fact, a recent survey found that only two per
cent of utility industry executives would consider ordering a new
nuclear power plant, compared to 89 per cent who would not. So
the candidates who support construction of new nuclear reactors
are not only well behind the public, but even behind the
electricity industry. At least President Clinton opposes forcing
a storage site for high-level radioactive waste on Nevada, but
the Republican candidates either support the industry-backed plan
or refuse to oppose it. Dole, Gramm, Alexander and Buchanan claim
to support increasing the authority of state governments, but
only President Clinton has actually come out against the nuclear
industry's attempt to cram a radioactive waste dump down the
throat of an unwilling state.

<i>A Public Interest Blueprint for Electricity
Restructuring</b></i><p>

</center>
<p>

Competition in the electric power industry could either usher in
a new era of cleaner, more affordable energy
services or prove to be the biggest consumer shakedown of our
time.  Americans consider electricity service to be a
basic commodity, making the stakes high and the consequences
potentially very severe.<b>   <p>

<p>

</b>With this nation on the verge of a historic transformation in
the way it generates, transmits and sells electricity, the
interests of average consumers must be fully represented in
efforts to write the new rules that will govern
competition.<b>  Power for the People</b> outlines a
comprehensive vision for restructuring the electric utility
industry to
benefit consumers and the environment while encouraging free and
fair competition.  Designed for implementation at
the state level, the blueprint proposes a variety of policy
mechanisms on issues that affect all Americans.<p>

<p>

Proposals to introduce competition into electricity markets pose
new challenges to regulators and elected officials. 
Bad public policy choices could seriously harm consumers in their
pocketbooks and in the quality of their
environment.  Specifically, possible outcomes of restructuring
include:<p>

<p>

     *    higher bills for small business and residential
consumers while large consumers receive discounts.<p>

     *    degraded environmental quality through increased use of
dirty plants and fossil fuels.<p>

     *    elimination of energy efficiency programs.<p>

     *    little or no development of renewable energy
technologies.<p>

     *    discrimination against low-income and rural
customers.<p>

     *    companies taking advantage of consumers through abusive
marketing and business practices.<p>

     *    unregulated monopoly utilities able to stifle
competition and increase profits.  <p>

     *    bailing out inefficient, high-cost utilities to reward
shareholders for bad business decisions.<p>

<p>

In order to prevent these outcomes from occurring and ensure that
benefits accrue to all classes of consumers, the
blueprint proposes that states do the following:<p>

<p>

     *    grant no recovery of costs for uneconomical utility
assets except in special circumstances.<p>

     *    break up vertically integrated utility monopolies by
requiring divestiture of assets.<p>

     *    create an independent energy agency to administer and
oversee energy efficiency, low-income, universal<p>

          service and research &amp; development programs.<p>

     *    aggressively promote an array of energy efficiency
programs funded by a system benefits charge.<p>

     *    guarantee universal service and bill assistance to
low-income and rural consumers.<p>

     *    increase the use of cleaner energy by requiring all
electric service providers to certify that a percentage          
     of their energy comes from renewable technologies.<p>

     *    enact standards on fossil fuel plants ensuring that the
emissions of hazardous pollutants decreases.<p>

<p>

These issues must be addressed prior to the introduction of
competition and cannot be solved simply by hoping that
the free market will provide equitable solutions.  All markets
exist within a regulatory and policy framework that
encourages certain types of business behavior.  If a new utility
structure provides the wrong incentives to
participants, the outcome could reward wasteful energy
consumption, promote the use of dirty generation sources,
allow one company to dominate a given market, and make it more
difficult for low-income and rural consumers to
meet their basic energy needs.  State legislatures and regulatory
commissions must aggressively engage these issues
and devise rules that facilitate competition and serve the public
interest.<p>

<p>

Consumer and environmental groups seek the creation of a safe,
affordable and sustainable energy system.  To that
end, <b>Power for the People</b> offers a vision and roadmap for
progressing towards a competitive market that includes
minimum standards, structural mechanisms for delivering basic
services, protections against market
power abuses
and assurances that small customers will be the first to see any
benefits.<p>

__________________________________________________<p>

<center><b>PUBLIC INTEREST BLUEPRINT FOR ELECTRICITY
RESTRUCTURING<p>

<i><a name="Principles and Summary">Principles and
Summary</a></i><p>

</center>
<p>

<p>

CONSUMER PROTECTION<p>

</b>The entrance of many new companies into electricity markets
creates the potential for fraud, deceptive marketing
and abuse of market power.  Consumers
must be protected against unfair business practices and be
assured that
sellers of electricity are not discriminatory or dishonest. 
Informed consumer choices will only be possible if
there is full disclosure of each company's resource portfolio and
environmental impacts.  States must also
aggressively monitor compliance with all consumer protection
laws.  If not already in existence, an independent
Citizen Utility Board should be established to advocate on behalf
of small business and residential electricity
consumers. <p>

<p>

<b>COST SHIFTING</b><p>

Utility restructuring should not result in a widening gap between
the rates paid by small and large consumers of
electricity.  Unless the benefits of competition are delivered
equally to all customer classes, a disproportionate cost
burden will fall to average citizens and ratepayers.  Under no
circumstance should any consumer on the utility
system be allowed to escape responsibility for supporting
reasonable low-income, renewable energy, R&amp;D and
energy efficiency programs.  <p>

<p>

<b>CREATION OF AN INDEPENDENT ENERGY AGENCY</b><p>

Ensuring independent oversight and administration of energy
efficiency, renewable energy, low-income and R&amp;D
programs will require the creation of an independent non-profit
or government agency.  This agency will
coordinate and adopt measures to ensure that all monies collected
from the electricity system are disbursed through
competitive bidding, effectively spent and directed to
high-priority programs that serve the public interest.  Since
allowing an existing utility to administer public funds for
energy services creates an inherent conflict of interest,
this agency must not be owned, operated or directed by an
existing utility or any other company conducting
business within the state's electricity sector.<p>

<p>

<b>DIVESTITURE OF UTILITY ASSETS</b><p>

Past monopoly status must not confer competitive advantages to
utilities or their subsidiaries.  Fair and free
competition will be impossible if one entity maintains monopoly
ownership over all aspects of the utility system. 
Requiring a distribution of assets among independent companies
will enhance competition and protect consumers
from the potential abuses of monopoly control.  In order to
protect against such abuses, utilities must separate their
generation, transmission and distribution assets into distinct
and unaffiliated corporate entities.<p>

<p>

<b>ENERGY EFFICIENCY<p>

</b>The aggressive pursuit of energy efficiency must not be
compromised by the switch to competitive electricity
markets.  Energy efficiency provides significant economic savings
and pollution prevention benefits that are not
sufficiently valued.  To ensure that efficiency receives priority
in a competitive system, funds should be collected
through a nonbypassable system
benefits charge and disbursed by the Independent Energy
Agency.  Total funding
must support an increase in activity over pre-competition
efficiency efforts.  In addition, state-guaranteed access to
below-market loans for efficiency improvements would help
consumers afford capital investments that yield energy
and financial savings over time.<p>

<p>

<b><p>

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION<p>

</b>Restructuring poses serious threats to environmental quality
that must be addressed prior to the implementation of
changes.  Competition must produce improvements in environmental
quality.  States should consider a range of
mechanisms to achieve net reductions in air, liquid and solid
waste emissions, including a requirement that all
generators meet federal and state environmental standards applied
to new plants or demonstrate that equivalent
emissions reductions have been achieved at other plants within
the state.  Furthermore, all fossil and nuclear
generators should be subject to fees based on emissions and waste
generation.  <p>

<p>

<b>RENEWABLE ENERGY</b><p>

Increased reliance on renewable energy must be a priority for any
restructured system given the considerable
environmental and economic benefits that accrue from its use. 
Since the value of renewables is not accurately
reflected in conventional pricing, states must adopt strong
structural measures that harness competitive forces and
guarantee a minimum level of resource diversity.  A renewables portfolio
standard, applied to all retail suppliers
of electricity, should be used to increase resource diversity
from current levels.  The pro-competitive nature of a
portfolio standard will result in low-cost renewables that
benefit all consumers and the environment.  Issues
relating to distributed generation, system reliability, off-grid
customers, renewables project financing and self-generation must
also be addressed.<p>

<p>

<b>RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT</b><p>

As utilities, industry and the federal government cut back on
research and development efforts, states must ensure
that adequate support is available to develop and deploy new
technologies that increase transmission and
distribution efficiency, enable distributed generation and reduce
or prevent pollution.  A system
benefits charge
should fund R&amp;D efforts administered by the Independent
Energy Agency.<p>

<p>

<b>RETAIL COMPETITION<p>

</b>This blueprint does not constitute an endorsement of retail
competition.  Unresolved issues could dramatically
affect the benefits retail competition offers to small business
and residential consumers.  If, however, a state
chooses to enact retail competition, it must mitigate the most
harmful potential consequences to consumers by
ensuring that methods of meaningful customer access and
aggregation are available.  In addition, small business
and residential consumers should be able to take advantage of
retail competition at the same time as large
consumers without any barriers to full participation.<p>

<p>

<b>STRANDED COSTS<p>

</b>The transition to a competitive market must offer concrete
savings to all consumers.  Granting full utility recovery
of stranded costs would saddle ratepayers with an unprecedented
burden that precludes many from realizing any
near-term benefits from restructuring.  Utility profits have
historically reflected the assumed risk of investments in
assets that could be rendered superfluous over time.  Relieving
utilities of liability for their bad decisions would
penalize efficient utilities and consumers.  The full burden of
covering the costs for uneconomical assets should fall
upon utility shareholders unless there is conclusive proof that
state regulators, over strenuous utility objections,
required a specific investment or that the decision to build a
stranded asset was, in hindsight, the least-cost option
available to the utility.  Furthermore, cost recovery should not
include anticipated profits, lost
revenues, expenses
or liabilities associated with future operations.  Any recovery
must also be balanced against all undervalued assets
in the utility system.<p>

<p>

<b>UNIVERSAL SERVICE</b><p>

Competition must bring benefits to all consumers.  Rural and
low-income consumers have the most to lose from
restructuring unless strong protections are enacted that ensure
universal service, access to competing suppliers, bill
assistance, reasonable payment policies, emergency service and
affordable rates.  Furthermore, degraded service
and redlining must be prohibited.  Funding for energy assistance
and universal service must be adequately supported through a nonbypassable 
system charge and low-income consumers should be guaranteed sufficient
weatherization and energy efficiency services.  <p>

<h1><b>Industry Views on Issues Raised by the Public Interest Blueprint
</b></h1>
<P><P>
Numerous organizations have a stake in the outcome of
electric industry restructuring. The following comparison of
other viewpoints on Blueprint issues was compiled by 
requesting "vision" documents from a variety of players in the
restructuring debate.  Many of these groups have not issued
comprehensive blueprints for state-level industry restructuring. 
In the absence of such documents, comparisons are made based on
available published materials, in many cases outlines of desired
federal legislation.
<p>

<b>CONSUMER PROTECTION</b><p>

<p>

<b>American Public Power Association</b><p>

<i>APPA's Views on Competition and Restructuring in the Electric
Utility Industry</i><p>

<p>

"In light of the ongoing industry consolidation, the fundamental
consumer protections embodied in PUHCA
must be preserved in any restructuring effort to guard against
potential market power abuses by giant holding
companies."  Confidential rate schedules should be disallowed.
<p>

<p>

<b>Electric Generation Association</b><p>

<i>Electric Generation Association's Vision of a Fully
Competitive Electric Industry</i><p>

<p>

"The LDC can help accomplish a state's social goals in regard to
electricity production and service." <p>

<p>

Electricity Consumers Resource Council (ELCON)<p>

<i>Blueprint for Customer Choice</i><p>

<p>

Consumers can choose a "primary service provider," while states
retain authority over local distribution and to
"impose, on a competitively neutral basis... requirements
necessary to preserve and advance universal service,
protect the public safety and welfare, ensure the continued
reliability of basic electric services, and safeguard
the rights of consumers."  Rules should be established to assure
the competitive availability of meters and
other load control equipment.  Proprietary information about
customers cannot be exclusively controlled, and
customer privacy must be protected.  "Customer proprietary
information that is individually identifiable, and
other proprietary information, may be shared with a subsidiary or
affiliated entity, or another provider of basic
electric services, only with the written consent of the person to
which such information relates or from whom
it was obtained."<p>

<p>

<b>IPALCO</b><p>

<i>A White Paper for Restructuring the Electric Utility Industry
-- The Real Problem and the
Real Solution: Customer Choice Through Universal Access</i><p>

<p>

"The existing federal or state sanctions for consumer deception
and anti-competitive conduct can be focused
on those who do not deal openly and fairly with customers and
competitors.  Moreover, the nature of
competition, giving a choice among suppliers to customers, is the
ultimate form of consumer protection."  The
need for consumer protection is one of the justifications for
continued state and local jurisdiction over
distribution access.<p>

<p>

<b>COST SHIFTING</b><p>

<p>

<b>Electric Generation Association</b><p>

<i>Electric Generation Association's Vision of a Fully
Competitive Electric Industry</i><p>

<p>

"Safeguards against abuse of market power should exist for all
industry participants."<p>

<p>

<b>Electricity Consumers Resource Council (ELCON)</b><p>

<i>Blueprint for Customer Choice</i><p>

<p>

"[T]he potential for any cost shifting is greatest the longer
industry restructuring is delayed or averted."<p>

<p>

<b>IPALCO</b><p>

<i>A White Paper for Restructuring the Electric Utility Industry
-- The Real Problem and the
Real Solution: Customer Choice Through Universal Access</i><p>

<p>

Expresses confidence in the long-term benefits of competition. 
While some artificially low rates may rise,
giving all buyers access at the same time would prevent customer
strandings.  "That large purchasers will have
more bargaining power than small purchasers is a simple fact of
life also present under current regulation. 
Allowing entry by aggregators and resellers will provide ample
opportunity for small consumers to receive a
large percentage of the benefits of bulk power
purchasing.....True competition is the surest way to assure
long-term low prices for all customers."<p>

<p>

<b>DIVESTITURE OF UTILITY ASSETS</b><p>

<p>

<b>Electric Generation Association</b><p>

<i>Electric Generation Association's Vision of a Fully
Competitive Electric Industry</i><p>

<p>

"To ensure fairness and to guard against self-dealing, EGA urges
that existing vertically-integrated utilities be
required, at a minimum, to functionally unbundle their generation
resources from their transmission and
distribution activities.  With appropriate safeguards to ensure
against market abuses, the generation
marketplace can include affiliate transactions."  Independent
System Operators should run the grid with
common access and pricing rules.<p>

<p>

<b>Electricity Consumers Resource Council (ELCON)</b><p>

<i>Blueprint for Customer Choice</i><p>

<p>

Retail services should be "unbundled" and offered competitively
without government oversight.  "There
should be no restrictions on the ownership of transmission and
distribution facilities.  Over time, ownership of
these assets should gravitate to those who value them most
highly, <i>i.e</i>., the users of transmission services. 
This could provide private user-owners a powerful incentive to
self-regulate the use of the grid."  Once
competition arrives, "grid owners will actively solicit (and not
impede) new business."  By the same token,
"there should be no restrictions on the ownership of a
corporation that exists to buy power at wholesale and
resell at retail," beyond enforcement of anti-trust laws.<p>

<p>

<b>IPALCO</b><p>

<i>A White Paper for Restructuring the Electric Utility Industry
-- The Real Problem and the
Real Solution: Customer Choice Through Universal Access</i><p>

<p>

Congress would create self-sustaining Independent System
Operators (ISOs) to run the grids.  The ISO could
be a private non-profit or a federal enterprise.  Transmission
owners would lease their facilities to the ISO
who assumes reliability responsibility.  The ISO issues access
charges based on all long-run marginal costs. 
Congress would spell out compensation for transmission owners
based on replacement value, not diminished
revenues. <p>

<p>

<b>National Independent Energy Producers</b><p>

<i>Fundamental Principles of Electricity Industry
Restructuring</i><p>

<p>

"[T]ariffs must require that utilities: (1) charge themselves for
their own uses of their transmission systems on
terms comparable to those that are applied to third party users;
and (2) provide any and all ancillary services
that will be required to conduct transactions on fair and
comparable terms."  Divestiture of generation from
transmission and distribution is the best way to address market
power issues.  "Alternative means of dealing
with market power (other than divestiture) are: functional
separation of generation from transmission and
distribution, with strong regulatory controls on affiliate
transactions, or a requirement that certain standards of
competition have been met."<p>

<p>

<b>ENERGY EFFICIENCY</b><p>

<p>

<b>Electric Generation Association</b><p>

<i>Electric Generation Association's Vision of a Fully
Competitive Electric Industry</i><p>

<p>

"Universal basic service, demand side management, lifeline rates,
low-income assistance and other social
programs can be established and maintained by state regulatory
commissions using non-bypassable
distribution charges."<p>

<p>

<b>Electricity Consumers Resource Council (ELCON)</b><p>

<i>Blueprint for Customer Choice</i><p>

<p>

"Market structures that encourage the marketing of energy
efficiency products and services that promote
overall economic efficiency should be encouraged."<p>

<p>

<b>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION</b> <p>

<p>

<b>Electric Generation Association</b><p>

<i>Electric Generation Association's Vision of a Fully
Competitive Electric Industry</i><p>

<p>

"Environmental and siting laws and regulations should be applied
in a consistent and non-discriminatory
manner to all industry participants."<p>

<p>

<b>Electricity Consumers Resource Council (ELCON)</b><p>

<i>Blueprint for Customer Choice</i><p>

<p>

"Competing suppliers should be allowed to bundle these products
and services with basic electric services and
financing.  These services include various 'green' pricing
options, in which customers may elect to pay a
premium for renewable energy or other resources or services that
help achieve environmental benefits beyond
federal statutory requirements."<p>

<p>

<b>RENEWABLE ENERGY</b><p>

<p>

<b>American Public Power Association</b><p>

<i>APPA's Views on Competition and Restructuring in the Electric
Utility Industry</i><p>

<p>

PURPA should remain law until "questions of market power for
existing generators can be resolved and
assurances can be given that a competitive market will not only
develop, but be sustained over time."<p>

<p>

<b>Electric Generation Association</b><p>

<i>Electric Generation Association's Vision of a Fully
Competitive Electric Industry</i><p>

<p>

PURPA would be eliminated, but "states will continue to use their
traditional authority to ensure resource and
fuel diversity, using mechanisms such as tax incentives and
siting authority that do not unfairly skew power
costs."<p>

<p>

<b>Electricity Consumers Resource Council (ELCON)</b><p>

<i>Blueprint for Customer Choice</i><p>

<p>

"Competing suppliers should be allowed to bundle these products
and services with basic electric services and
financing.  These services include various 'green' pricing
options, in which customers may elect to pay a

<p>

<b>IPALCO</b><p>

<i>A White Paper for Restructuring the Electric Utility Industry
-- The Real Problem and the
Real Solution: Customer Choice Through Universal Access</i><p>

<p>

PURPA could "become a curious anachronism once consumers are free
to buy electricity directly from
generation sources." <p>

<p>

<b>National Independent Energy Producers</b><p>

<i>Fundamental Principles of Electricity Industry
Restructuring</i><p>

<p>

"There should be no federal prohibition on or preemption of state
decisions to favor certain fuel sources or
technologies.  States should remain free to design source
portfolios that meet fuel diversity and other
legitimate state needs.  There should be competitive procurement
to meet such requirements."<p>

<p>

<b>RETAIL COMPETITION</b><p>

<p>

<b>American Public Power Association</b><p>

<i>APPA's Views on Competition and Restructuring in the Electric
Utility Industry</i><p>

<p>

"Retail wheeling alone is not sufficient to guarantee least cost
electric service to retail customers, and it may
actually impede the development of effective competition.  Retail
wheeling should not be mandated until non-discriminatory, open
transmission access is ensured, fully competitive, regional bulk
power markets are
developed, and issues related to the obligation of a utility to
provide service to customers are resolved." 
Localities must retain the right to form a municipal utility.<p>

<p>

<b>Edison Electric Institute</b><p>

<i>A Study on the Treatment of, and Jurisdiction Over, Electric
Utility Costs During
Transition to a More Competitive Industry</i><p>

<p>

"If a state permits consumers to have the option of direct retail
access to electricity suppliers of their choice, it
should condition the availability of such access on the
consumer's payment of its fair share of the system costs
previously incurred for its benefit."  States have prime
responsibility for retail cost recovery, but "FERC
should play a 'backstop' role, to step in only when a state does
not or cannot provide for recovery of stranded
costs."<p>

<p>

<b>Electric Generation Association</b><p>

<i>Electric Generation Association's Vision of a Fully
Competitive Electric Industry</i><p>

<p>

Federal legislation should set policies that would require
competitive markets by January 1, 2003.  "FERC
should be authorized to certify the existence of a competitive
market, in which a utility must show that its
market power has been mitigated through unbundling, sale or
divestiture of generation resources or by other
means.  Such steps would be a prerequisite, for example, for
acceptance of market-based rates or elimination
of PURPA's mandatory purchase requirements."  There should be no
ownership restrictions, such as PUHCA,
and federal or state-owned power should be privatized.<p>

<p>

<b>Electricity Consumers Resource Council (ELCON)</b><p>

<i>Blueprint for Customer Choice</i><p>

<p>

Federal legislation should require every utility to file a
restructuring plan within 18 months.  "[W]holesale-only
competition is an oxymoron.....All consumers should be allowed to
purchase electrical services from
multiple suppliers."  Rate of return regulation would end, and no
state statute or regulation would be permitted
to effectively prevent the entry of any potential market
participant.<p>

<p>

<b>IPALCO</b><p>

<i>A White Paper for Restructuring the Electric Utility Industry
-- The Real Problem and the
Real Solution: Customer Choice Through Universal Access</i><p>

<p>

Competition cannot begin on a state-by-state basis.  Federal
legislation should require states provide the
following conditions: 1. all power suppliers must be allowed
equal access to distribution facilities subject only
to "certification based on technical, managerial and financial
ability to provide power;" 2. aggregators and
resellers of power must also have access; 3. distribution
providers must coordinate with transmission system
operator; 4. distribution providers must provide
non-discriminatory access to ancillary services (meter
reading, connection/disconnection, billing, etc) at
FERC-determined charges based on long-run marginal
costs.  While states can determine when to allow competition for
distribution providers, they should do so. 
Access charges should be imposed on the power user, not seller. 
All remnants of original-cost ratemaking are
to be eliminated.<p>

<p>

<b>National Independent Energy Producers</b><p>

<i>Fundamental Principles of Electricity Industry
Restructuring</i><p>

<p>

"[D]irect access of wholesale and retail customers to electric
suppliers of their choice should be the ultimate
goal of industry restructuring.  This goal should be advanced
expeditiously."  No mandatory pools or similar
devices are needed for the market to operate.  Once full
competition exists, utilites should lose protection from
anti-trust claims. <p>

<p>

<b>STRANDED COSTS</b><p>

<p>

<b>American Public Power Association</b><p>

<i>APPA's Views on Competition and Restructuring in the Electric
Utility Industry</i><p>

<p>

"[R]ecovery of such costs may be appropriate if retail wheeling
is allowed.  Rules for retail services have
traditionally been the prerogative of the states, and any change
in these rules and associated cost
consequences, should be addressed at the state level."<p>

<p>

<b>Edison Electric Institute</b><p>

<i>A Study on the Treatment of, and Jurisdiction Over, Electric
Utility Costs During
Transition to a More Competitive Industry</i><p>

<p>

"Efficient competition potentially benefiting all customers will
not be achieved if some customers are able to
avoid paying their fair share of costs approved, ordered or
deferred by regulators under traditional regulation. 
If such cost avoidance is allowed, it would promote unfair
competition among power suppliers, uneconomic
bypass, distorted pricing and inappropriate cost
shifting....Utilities should take all reasonable actions
available
to mitigate stranded costs.  Further, state and federal
regulatory commissions can assist by providing utilities
with adequate financial incentives to mitigate stranded costs,
including appropriate 'incentive' or
'performance-based' regulation."<p>

<p>

<b>Electric Generation Association</b><p>

<i>Electric Generation Association's Vision of a Fully
Competitive Electric Industry</i><p>

<p>

Prior contracts and regulatory committments should be honored. 
Contract-based costs should be paid by exit
fees; retail strandings, by access fees.  "EGA supports the full
recovery of all net legitimate, verifiable,
prudently incurred, non-mitigatable and public utility commission
(PUC) approved stranded costs.  Such
recovery includes both existing utility assets and power purchase
contracts." No recovery of post EPAct costs.<p>

<p>

<b>Electricity Consumers Resource Council (ELCON)</b><p>

<i>Blueprint for Customer Choice</i><p>

<p>

"[F]ull recovery would hinder the development of a truly
competitive market by creating a 'safe harbor' for
these largely, uneconomic costs."  State commissions should issue
rules on retail cost recovery but these rules
cannot excessively hamper competition.  "Efficient competition is
wholly inconsistent with the continued
employment of <i>any</i> uneconomic asset."<p>

<p>

<b>IPALCO</b><p>

<i>A White Paper for Restructuring the Electric Utility Industry
-- The Real Problem and the
Real Solution: Customer Choice Through Universal Access</i><p>

<p>

Stranded costs are neither new nor unique to electricity.  If
"lost revenue" recovery is permitted, inefficient
utilities may dump excess power, allowing predatory pricing
against low-cost producers.   "[R]eal competition
will prevail only if the recovery of so-called stranded costs --
the balance of past utility company expenditures
that are no longer economic -- is limited.  For customers and new
entrants into the energy business, a broad
policy of stranded cost recovery is a threat to achieving lower
energy prices, as well as a huge barrier to
competition."<p>

<p>

<b>National Independent Energy Producers</b><p>

<i>Fundamental Principles of Electricity Industry
Restructuring</i><p>

<p>

Because honoring past committments is important for future
markets and capital access, utilities should
recover "legitimate and verifiable" stranded investment and PURPA
contract payments.  "Stranded utility
investment should be calculated using market mechanisms and be
subject to full mitigation requirements." 
Stranded costs would be recovered by a non-bypassable access
fee.<p>

<p>

<b>UNIVERSAL SERVICE</b><p>

<p>

<b>Edison Electric Institute</b><p>

<i>A Study on the Treatment of, and Jurisdiction Over, Electric
Utility Costs During
Transition to a More Competitive Industry</i><p>

<p>

"If the exclusive utility franchise is modified, the utility's
obligation to provide service to all who request it,
on a nondiscriminatory basis, must also be modified."<p>

<p>

<b>Electric Generation Association</b><p>

<i>Electric Generation Association's Vision of a Fully
Competitive Electric Industry</i><p>

<p>

"EGA believes that if and when an LDC [local distribution
company] is acting as a supplier of last resort, it
must purchase power supplies from the spot market or through
competitive procurement.  The LDC can help
accomplish a state's social goals in regard to electricity
production and service."<p>

<p>

"Universal basic service, demand side management, lifeline rates,
low-income assistance and other social
programs can be established and maintained by state regulatory
commissions using non-bypassable
distribution charges."<p>

<p>

<b>Electricity Consumers Resource Council (ELCON)</b><p>

<i>Blueprint for Customer Choice</i><p>

<p>

"Where competitive markets are demonstrably inadequate to
safeguard important public policy goals, such as
the continued universal availability of essential electrical
services at reasonable and affordable
prices...Congress should establish workable regulatory procedures
to advance these goals... Eligible customers
would receive a package of services called, 'essential electrical
services' which may be a subset of basic
electrical services."  A Federal-State Joint Board on Universal
Service should be formed to work with FERC
on rules for universal service.  All service providers should
contribute to a universal service fund, which
would be used to pay entities designated by states as "essential
service providers" in necessary areas.  States
may expand their definition of universal service beyond the
FERC's.<p>

Introduction

After the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl, the U.S. House of
Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee for
Energy Conservation and Power asked the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) to provide a list of the worst nuclear plants in
the country.  The NRC responded with a preliminary list of
sixteen reactors, the NRC's first "watch list."  These problem
plants would receive greater regulatory attention in the form of
additional inspections in an effort to improve their performance. 
Every six months NRC Senior managers meet with regional
administrators and determine which reactors will be placed on the
watch list. Public Citizen submitted a Freedom of Information Act
request in an attempt to gain access to the documents used to
develop the list.  The NRC replied that there were no such
documents.1

Unfortunately, the NRC has not explained the criteria used to
create their list and the meeting where such determinations are
made is closed to the public.  Nuclear Lemons offers the public a
method for assessing relative reactor safety which can be
discussed, debated and improved upon.

Identifying the worst reactors in the country is important for
several reasons.  First, NRC funds for nuclear reactor inspection
and enforcement are limited; if the worst reactors are
identified, scarce resources can be allocated appropriately.  If
these reactors are shut down, then limited funds for nuclear
regulation may be directed to other problem plants.  Second, as
competition in the electricity industry pushes utilities toward a
phaseout of nuclear power in the United States, the worst
reactors should be the first retired.  Third, organizations other
than the NRC like the Federal Emergency Management Agency, state
regulatory agencies, and Congress should be made aware of problem
plants.  Finally, citizens have a right to know any and all
threats that nuclear power poses to their health, families,
homes, and communities.

Public Citizen has produced Nuclear Lemons based on the
conviction that the public has a right to know not only which
nuclear reactors are the worst in the nation, but also the
methods by which this assessment is made.


Notes
1.  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, letter from Donnie H.
Grimsley, Director, Division of Rules and Records, NRC FOIA-86-433, 
Aug. 1, 1986.


Summary of Findings

To determine which reactors are the lemons of the nuclear industry,
Public Citizen has ranked every reactor in the nation based on
twelve performance indicators.  Nuclear Lemons are reactors with
the worst overall performance from 1993 to 1995.

Nuclear Lemons is an overall ranking based on twelve categories. 
While reactors that are particularly poor performers in only one
category may not rank as Nuclear Lemons, their poor performance is
no less noteworthy.  For this reason, the worst reactors in each of
the twelve categories are listed below.

Since NRC began the "watch list," thirty-seven reactors operated by
eighteen utilities have been designated as problem plants a total
of 211 times.  The utilities with the most reactors on the "watch
list" have been Illinois' Commonwealth Edison and the Tennessee
Valley Authority.  Six of the twelve Commonwealth Edison reactors
have appeared on the "watch list."  The record of the Tennessee
Valley Authority is even more abysmal.  Every reactor owned by TVA,
with the exception of the newly licensed Watts Bar reactor, has
been designated as a problem plant and placed on the NRC's "watch
list."

Historically, there has been a strong correlation between Public
Citizen's Nuclear Lemons and the NRC's "watch list."  Over the past
ten years and five editions of Nuclear Lemons, only one nuclear
plant placed on NRC's "watch list" failed to rank as a Lemon.  The
findings in this edition of Nuclear Lemons indicate that many of
the worst nuclear reactors in the nation have failed to pull
themselves up from the bottom of the industry rankings, despite
increased scrutiny from the NRC.  As the NRC has designated fewer
reactors as warranting additional scrutiny, the agency has missed
significant safety problems that have eventually resulted in
extended reactor shutdowns.  The last two editions of Nuclear
Lemons indicated that the Millstone reactors in Connecticut were in
trouble.  However, the subjective determination of NRC's senior
management has resulted in regulatory inaction, which constitutes
an abrogation of the NRC statutory responsibility to protect the
public health and safety.

While the NRC has the means of assessing safety and performance
problems, it apparently lacks the will to rectify the situation. 
The NRC has allowed problem plants to continue to operate, despite
the fact that they have failed to improve their safety performance. 
The perpetually poor performance of Commonwealth Edison's Dresden
and the Tennessee Valley Authority's Browns Ferry indicates that
NRC oversight and regulation is inadequate and that the "watch
list" process is a failure. Public Citizen finds that in several
performance categories any improvements are more a function of
changes in reporting requirements or NRC policies than actual
improvement in the operation of nuclear power plants.  This is true
for six of the twelve performance indicators used in this report,
including:  capacity factors, enforcement discretion, licensee
event reports, safety system actuations,systematic assessments of
licensee performance and scrams. Additionally, the database that
tabulates violations is so inaccurate as to be almost useless for
any in-depth comparisons over time. This leads us to question how
NRC can implement performance-based regulation when it is incapable
of determining the actual performance of the nuclear reactors it
purports to regulate.

<CENTER><H2>CRITICAL MASS ENERGY PROJECT</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Since its founding in 1974, Public Citizen's <STRONG>CRITICAL
MASS ENERGY PROJECT</STRONG> has been a powerful voice in the
movement to decrease reliance on nuclear and fossil fuels and to
promote safe, affordable, and environmentally sound energy
alternatives.  Our name is taken from founder Ralph Nader's
observation that "a critical mass of people can make the critical
difference" in winning a sustainable energy future.
<P>
<STRONG>Critical Mass</STRONG> prepares and disseminates reports,
lobbies Congress, and acts as a watchdog of key federal and state
energy regulatory agencies.  In addition, <STRONG>Critical
Mass</STRONG> works closely with other citizens' groups and
individuals across the country, empowering them to participate in
important decisions affecting their health, safety, and standard
of living.
<P>
<STRONG>Critical Mass</STRONG> remains a forceful critic of the
failed atomic power industry, which promised energy "too cheap to
meter" and has instead delivered high cost, accidents, and
mounting radioactive waste.  <STRONG>Critical Mass</STRONG> also
supports decreasing U.S. dependence on coal and oil and building
a sustainable energy future by emphasizing efficient energy use
and cleaner, safer, renewable technologies like solar and wind
power.  Among its many achievements, <STRONG>Critical
Mass</STRONG> has:
<P>
<STRONG>1986</STRONG> -- Demonstrated the economic feasibility of
phasing out nuclear power plants in the U.S., following the
Chernobyl accident.
<P>
<STRONG>1988</STRONG> -- Documented the superior ability of
efficiency and renewables to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that
scientists predict will cause global warming.
<P>
<STRONG>1990-91</STRONG> -- Organized a plan for "A Sustainable
Energy Future," endorsed by 175 organizations nationwide, as an
alternative to the Bush Administration's business-as-usual energy
policies.
<P>
<STRONG>1990-92</STRONG> -- Blocked the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission's attempt to deregulate large volumes of nuclear
wastes by classifying them as "Below Regulatory Concern."
<P>
<STRONG>1993</STRONG> -- Released secret documents revealing that
America's nuclear reactors have more safety problems than the NRC
admits in a report entitled <EM>Hear No Evil, See No Evil, Speak
No Evil: What the NRC Won't Tell You About America's Nuclear
Reactors</EM>.
<P>
<STRONG>1994</STRONG> -- Analysed and compared the environmental
impacts every automobile and light truck model sold in the United
States. 
<P>
<STRONG>1994</STRONG> -- Persuaded Congress to terminate the
Advanced Liquid Metal Reactor, a dangerous and wasteful breeder
reactor program. 
<P>
<STRONG>1995</STRONG> -- Released <EM>The Renewable Energy
Sourcebook: A Primer for Action (Section I)</EM>, a comprehensive
state-by-state study of renewable energy use, resource potential,
policies, programs, and utility activities. 
<P>
<STRONG>1995</STRONG> -- Released <EM>A Roll of the Dice: NRC's
Efforts to Renew Nuclear Reactor Licenses</EM>, explaining the
safety and financial risks created by the NRC's new rule allowing
license extensions for nuclear reactors. 
<P>
<STRONG>1995</STRONG> -- Persuaded Congress to terminate funding
for the Gas Turbine Modular Helium Reactor, an expensive and
dangerous reactor design.  Killing the GT-MHR will save $2.6
billion in coming years.

<H3>
INTERNSHIP PROGRAM
</H3>
<P>
<B>Duties:</B>  Our internship program emphasizes substantive projects. 
These often include researching and writing a report on some
energy-related policy or legal matter.  They may also include
helping in a lobbying campaign, working with the media, and/or
providing assistance to local safe energy organizations.  Interns
will be asked to help out with some administrative tasks, but these
duties will take less than 20% of the intern's time.
</P>
<P>
<B>Supervision:</B>  Each intern is assigned to work with a member of the
full-time Critical Mass staff who will provide general supervision
and serve as a resource.  Given the nature of our work, however, it

<h1><center>Statement by Ralph Nader</h1>
<h3>January 28, 1996</h3>
<h3>Washington, DC</h3>
<p>

</center>
Twenty-five years ago we began the drive against corporate welfare. Since then, Public Citizen's
Congress watch and Essential Information's Corporate Welfare Project have issued a series of
reports titled <i>Aid for Dependent Corporations </i>or <i>AFDC</i>, identifying federal grants, subsides and
tax breaks for corporations. The most recent report lists more than 150 federal corporate welfare
programs totaling almost $200 billion annually.<p>

Today's coalition shows that cutting corporate welfare has become a bipartisan issue.
Organizations from the left and the right and members of Congress from both sides of the aisle
finally have come together to begin to tag programs for elimination. This welfare for wealthy
companies wastes taxpayers dollars, harms the environment and makes a mockery of the recent
reductions in federal social spending programs for the poor and powerless.<p>

Consider the following comparisons between social spending programs and a specific corporate
welfare program -- The Overseas Private Investment Corporation or OPIC -- that is included on
the Stop Welfare Coalition's list. OPIC provides U.S. taxpayer-subsidized loans, loan guarantees
and insurance to multinational corporations.<p>

<i> Beneficiaries of corporate welfare are rich, but children and families who receive federal
payments must be poor.</i> For example, in 1995 Citicorp received subsidized insurance from OPIC
to cover more than $800 million in potential losses and U.S. West obtained $100 million in OPIC
financing. Both companies generated more than a billion dollars each in income in 1995.<p>

<i>Recipients of corporate welfare enjoy benefits for a long or unlimited periods of time, while the
recently-enacted welfare changes limit lifetime welfare assistance for individuals to five years.</i>
OPIC loans provide maturities of up to 15 years, <i>after</i> a "suitable" grace period and OPIC may
offer insurance with terms as long as 20 years.<p>

<i>Corporate welfare beneficiaries have cut jobs in the United States; recent changes in welfare
laws require able-bodies adults to work after they have received two years of benefits.</i> Both
Levi-Strauss and Kimberly-Clark have received OPIC benefits for trade adjustment assistance
from the U.S. government due to the companies' imports.<p>

<i>Foreign companies may receive U.S. corporate welfare benefits: the recent individual welfare
changes prohibit Supplemental Security income or food stamp benefits for most legal immigrants
who have not become U.S. citizens.</i> Foreign investors may own up to 75 percent of the equity in
overseas projects that receive OPIC financing. In 1995, OPIC provided loans to projects owned
in part by companies form countries including Russia, Colombia, Jamaica and Ghana.<p>

<i>Recipients of corporate welfare benefits may have committed misdeeds; recent welfare law
changes deny cash aid and food stamps to anyone convicted of felony drug charges. </i>In 1995,
Magna Copper Company received $200 million in OPIC insurance for copper mining in Peru.
The previous year, the company has paid a penalty of more than $1 million to the Mine Safety
and Health Administration after being cited for 45 violations of U.S. federal mine safety
standards, including 23 that had led to a mine collapse that had killed four workers.<p>

Other programs started by the Stop Corporate Welfare Coalition exhibit the same type of
corporate favoritism.<p>

I, however, do not support the categorical inclusion of the Rural Utility Service on this list
because some of its subsidized loans, if administered properly, can help insure that now-income
families in rural areas have access to affordable electricity and phone service.<p>

Corporate welfare in the form of subsides, grants, tax escapes and bailouts can cost taxpayers
many billions of dollars annually. A serous attempt to address the outrage of corporate welfare
should focus not only on the programs highlights today but on other big ticket items, including,
most notably, the myriad defense boondoggles. Corporate welfare opponents should also work to
eliminate the billions of dollars in hidden entitlements contained in the tax code.<p>

<p>

<b><center><h2>Statement of Joan Claybrook</h2></center>
<p>

<center><h3>President, Public Citizen</h3></center>
<p>

<p>

<center><h1>CUT CORPORATE WELFARE NOW</h1></b></center>
<p>

<p>

	"Last year there was a major bipartisan effort to change our campaign finance laws -- to
get special interest money out of elections.  Today we are here to announce a related
effort to get special interest pork out of the federal budget.  <p>

<p>

	"Our political system is awash in corporate money and our federal budget is awash in
corporate handouts.  The political money is only a fraction of the handout money.  But it
is the key that opens the door to the Treasury.<p>

<p>

	"This is an unprecedented coalition gathered here to protect taxpayers.  Its broad diversity
illustrates the broad public opposition to unjustified government handouts.<p>

<p>

	"All of our organizations have different priorities. Some want a balanced budget. Others
want much more spending for vital domestic programs.  Some want to cut entitlements.
Others want higher taxes on the wealthy.  Whatever our disagreements, we are united on
one issue - stop corporate welfare.<p>

<p>

	"Last year, many of us were on different sides when Congress' overhauled Aid to
Families with Dependent Children -- AFDC.  However, this year we are on the same side
in this effort to eliminate another AFDC program -- Aid for Dependent Corporations.<p>

<p>

	"This initial "hit list" of corporate handouts is just the beginning of a much longer list of
outrageous government giveaways.  Some of these corporate subsidies not only waste
public funds. They also directly threaten public safety. <p>

<p>

	"Public Citizen is especially concerned about the Energy Department's plutonium
pyroprocessing program, which will cost the taxpayers some $250 million over five years. 
Reprocessing plutonium is not a good method of nuclear waste disposal. It simply creates
even more hazardous radioactive waste that is not suitable for the long-term waste storage
facilities under consideration. Pyroprocessing is the latest attempt by nuclear proponents
to justify pumping billions of dollars into nuclear energy to save an all but dead industry.<p>

<p>

	"We thank Representative Kasich for his leadership on this issue.  We look forward to
working with him, and with this wide array of advocacy groups, in this important effort to
stop corporate welfare."<p>

<h1><center>Corporate Welfare Hit List</h1>
<p>

</center>
<h3>Rural Utilities Service (RUS) (Department of Agriculture)</h3>
The RUS provides subsidized loans to one type of electric supplier (electric coops), which serve
a small portion of the population (10%). The loans are provided at interest rates that are below
the Treasury's cost of borrowing and well below what investor-owned utilities pay. Today, there
is no need for the government to do this.<p>

Its predecessor, the Rural Electrification Administration (REA), was established during the
Depression to bring electricity to rural areas when other utilities would not serve them. This goal
has been accomplished. In fact, many rural utilities are facing increased competition from
investor-owned utilities.<p>

Subsidized financing has wasted money. <i> The Wall Street Journal</i> indicated that the
administration has begun "a multimillion government bailout of several rural electric suppliers
that otherwise might not survive in the new era of utility deregulation." they invested heavily in
nuclear power plants.<p>

According to the Congressional Budgeting Office (CBO), "Because the cost of interest accounts
for only a small percentage of the typical customer's's bill, eliminating the remaining federal
subsidy would have little effect of the utility rates that most borrowers charge their customers."<p>

<i><b>Proposal:</i></b> Terminate all financial support for electric and telephone loans. (Estimated savings:
<b>$190 million </b>over five years)<p>

<h3>Market Access Program (MAP)</h3>
The MAP, formerly known as the Market Production Program, assists exporters of fruits, nuts,
vegetables, meat poultry, eggs, seafood and wine. Payments are made to help offset the costs of
advertising by trade associations, commodity groups and some firms.<p>

Between 1991 and 1994, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) allocated about 35% of the
program's funding for brand-name products. The major recipients were Sunkist, Dole Fresh Fruit
Company, Ocean Spray Cranberries, and M&amp;M Mars. The 1996 farm bill targets assistance for
brand promotions to small businesses; large companies; however, still benefit from payments to
trade associations and cooperatives.<p>

According to GAO, there is little evidence that the program is actually promoting additional
advertising. It may simply be replacing private funds.<p>

<i><b>Proposal:</i></b> Terminate the Market Access Program (Estimated Savings: <b>$347</b> million over five
years)<p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>Animas La Plata</h3>
Animas La Plata is am enormous public works project located in southwest Colorado that will
provide federally subsidized water to farmers to grow low-value crops, such as alfalfa. The
project would divert much of the water from the Animas river, and pump it over 1,00 feet uphill.<p>

According to the Department of the Interior, the cost-benefit ratio of the project is 3 to 1.
Environmentally this project threatens endangered species of fish, would destroy game habitats
and cause violations of the Clean Air Act downstream in New Mexico.<p>

<i><b>Proposal:</b></i> Terminate, or modify, the project. (Estimated Savings: <b>$432 million</b> over the life of
the project if canceled (Federal share only))<p>

<h3>Pyroprocessing Program</h3>
Plutonium Pyroprocessing separates the spent fuel from nuclear reactors into plutonium, uranium
and other elements, thereby creating new fuel for reactors.<p>

Several large companies - Westinghouse, General Electric, and British Nuclear Fuels - are
interested in, and will benefit from, technology to reprocess commercial nuclear fuel. This
program is a continuation of a key technology developed for the breeder reactor program that was
terminated in 1994.<p>

<i><b>Proposal:</i></b> Terminate funding for the program (Estimated Savings: <b>$100 million</b> over four years.<p>

<h3>Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) Roads Program</h3>
The ARC was established in 1965 to promote long-term economic development in the 13
Appalachian states. It supports a variety of programs, including the Appalachian Development
Highway System. Although the program has certainly benefited construction companies, there is
little evidence that it has actually provided long-term development.<p>

It duplicates activities funded by other agencies, such as the Department of Transportation's's
federal highway program. According to a Special Report by Citizens Against Government Waste,
"Most of the roads are simply linked well-to-do urban centers to other well-to-do urban
centers..."<p>

<b><i>Proposal:</i></b> Terminate the roads portion of the ARC. (Estimated Savings: <b>$500 million</b> over five
years)<p>

<h3>Fossil Energy Research and Development (including Oil, Coal and
Gas Research)</h3>
A principle category of applied research that the Department of Energy pursues is targeted to
mature industries involving oil companies (Exxon, Chevron, and Texaco), coal companies, and
natural gas companies. Development of applies energy technologies is better left to the private
sector. Companies in industries that are most likely to use the technology developed in such
programs - often electrical utilities - and their equipment are better able than DOE researchers to
understand the commercial value of technology.<p>

These firms already spend a great deal of money to develop new technologies. According to
CNO, this research has not been particularly effective. "The major new technologies for
enhanced oil recovery, for example, have come from private industry, not DOE. In other
instances, DOE continues to develop technologies in which the market has no clear interest."<p>

<i><b>Proposal:</i></b> Terminate funding for fossil energy research and development (Estimated Savings:
<b>1.37 billion</b> over five years)<p>

<h3>Timber Roads in the National Forests (USDA's Forest Service)</h3>
Serious problems exist concerning every aspect of the Forest Service, including road
construction. Virtually all of the actual construction is done by  timber companies to gain access
to timber sales. These roads are also used for subsidized recreational access.<p>

Preliminary reports from GAO indicate that both timber companies and recreational users are
being subsidized for the use of these roads. If private firms are going to profit from the use of
private lands, they should pay all associated costs, including the costs of road construction.<p>

<b><i>Proposal:</i></b> The users of roads in the National Forests, whether for logging or for recreation,
should pay full costs for those roads.<p>

Note: We do not know the exact amount of savings. Conservatively, we believe the savings
would exceed over $100 million over five years. We are awaiting a GAO request by
Representative Kasich to give us an exact number.<p>

<h3>Clean Coal Technology</h3>
The Clean Coal Technology Program (CCTP) was created in 1984 to assist private industry in
developing commercial technologies that would use coal in environmentally sound ways.<p>

Most of the projects funded by the CCTP will demonstrate technologies to retro fit coal-burning
electricity generating plants. The program benefits electric utilities and large industrial users of
coal.<p>

Since the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990, the private sector has faced a clear
legislative mandate for lowering coal emissions. Electric utilities and large industrial users of
coal now have a clear economic motive for selecting among current practices and the lowest-cost
options for reducing emissions.<p>

<i><b>Proposal: </b></i>Rescind funding from prior years and terminate the CCTP (Estimated Savings:<b>$500
million </b>over five years)<p>

<h3>Overseas Private Investing Corporation (OPIC)</h3>
OPIC provides loans, loan guarantees, and political risk insurance to U.S. companies that invest
in risky, developing countries. The major beneficiaries of this program are large corporations and
politically connected individuals. If their investments are profitable, they benefit. If, however,
loans are not repaid or insurance claims are files, taxpayers are exposed to financial risks. In
addition, OPIC-financed projects have frequently harmed the environments of host companies.<p>

Since OPIC does not add to the supply of available capital, it, at best, can shift investments from
one country to another, riskier countries. This distorts investment decisions and wastes American
capital - capital that could be used in the United States.<p>

<b><i>Proposal:</b></i> Allow OPIC to mange its existing portfolio but preclude them from providing new
insurance or new loans. (Estimated Savings: <b>$281 million</b> over five years)<p>

<h3>General Agreements to Borrow (Part of the IMF)</h3>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was created as part of the Bretton Woods agreement and
has gradually transformed its mission from managing exchange rates to promoting international
development. The General Agreements to Borrow (GAB), which are part of the IMF, are
intended to prevent any future "international monetary crisis" caused by developing countries
that are unable to pay their bills. Often, this money is owed to large American banks.<p>

We are bailing these banks out despite the fact that the developing countries have enough money
to pay for bloated bureaucracies, operate money-losing state-sponsored industries and spend too
much on their militaries. Furthermore, new IMF funding to developing countries frequently ends
up substituting IMF debt for reschedulable bank debt.<p>

The IMF will do considerable harm to developing countries by continuing to make loans to their
governments. Bailing these governments out only encourages them to continue policies that are
detrimental to their citizens.<p>

To ensure that it gets repaid, the IMF imposes "conditionality" omits loans - policy changes that
borrowing countries must undertake to receive a loan. Frequently, the IMF has forced developing
nations to enact unsound economic policies that have led to tax increases, currency devaluations
and resource exploitation.<p>

Like the World Bank, the IMF operates outside of the public scrutiny, releasing almost no
information to the public, thereby avoiding any accountability for its programs.<p>

<i><b>Proposal: </b></i>Oppose increased U.S. participation in the GAB. (Estimated Savings: <b>$3.5 billion</b>
over five years.<p>

<h3>IMF Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF)</h3>
The ESAF is the IMF's low interest loan program for the poorest developing countries. The
ESAF was created in 1987 to enable the IMF to provide assistance at below market interest rates
to low-income developing countries that cannot pay their bills to banks and other corporations.<p>

Borrowers must be prepared to "adopt multi-year economic and structural reform programs."
Many of the concerns about the IMF also apply to ESAF. In addition, despite 10 years of ESAF
lending, poverty continues to increase in many ESAF countries.<p>

<b><i>Proposal:</b></i> Oppose increased U.S. participation in the ESAF. (Estimated Savings: <b>$150 million</b>
over five years.<p>

<p>

<h3>Highway Demonstration Projects</h3>
These are specific construction projects that Members of Congress have requested. They can
range in scope from paving a gravel road to building a multilane highway. ISTEA included 539
demonstration projects with an accompanying cost of $6.2 billion.<p>

This amount indicates a five-fold increase compared to the 1987 Transportation's bill.<p>

According to the GAO, highway demonstration projects provide limited benefits.<p>

1.They are frequently not consistent with key transportation priorities, do not appear on any state
or regional transportation plans, and do not receive much scrutiny.<p>

2. They often have problems that cause them to languish in the development stage. These
problems have ranged from threatened intrusion on wetlands to citizen opposition. One proposed
highway construction project GAO reviewed would have cut through a low income housing
project undergoing renovation with federal funds.<p>

3. They tend to draw funds from other major federal aid highway programs, such as a Interstate
Maintenance.<p>

<i><b>Proposal:</i></b> End all highway demonstration projects. (Estimated Savings: <b>$4.0 billion</b> over five
years)<p>

<u><h3>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:      January 30, 1997</h3></u><p>

<p>

<h1><b><center>1996 Federal Campaign Spending Up 33% From 
1992</h1></b>						<p>

<b><h2>Total Candidate and Major Party Disbursements top $2 billion<p>

</h2></b><p>

</center>
Washington, D.C., -- Public Citizen today released a post-election summary of spending by federal
candidates and the two major parties during the 1996 elections.  Shattering all previous records,
total spending surpassed the $2 billion mark.  These 1996 figures represent a 33% increase over the
$1.58 billion in total spending for 1992, the last presidential cycle.  Although the 1996 total
includes $234 million of public funds spent by the presidential campaigns, the vast majority of the
money was again raised through large contributions from wealthy individuals, corporations, and
special interest PACs.<p>

<p>

	"These staggering sums show, once again, the compelling need for Congress to enact real reform of
our campaign finance system," said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook.  <p>

<p>

	The new totals surpass old records in virtually every category.  Total major party spending,
including all "hard" and "soft" dollars topped $866 million, up over 80% from the $479.9 million
spent in 1992.  "Soft money" spending (supported by unregulated, large donations to the major
party committees from wealthy individuals, corporations, and labor unions) by the Republican
Party totaled nearly $150 million, up 224% from the $46.2 million the party spent in 1992.  
Meanwhile, the Democratic Party's $117 million in "soft money" disbursements were up 257%
from the $32.9 million spent in 1992.  <p>

<p>

	Congressional campaign spending also reached new heights.  From January 1, 1995 through
November 25, 1996, congressional candidates spent over $742 million.  Republican candidates<p>

outspent Democrats $331 million to $292 million.  Once again this year, incumbents easily
outspent challengers $330 million to $152 million, a whopping two-to-one advantage, as more than
95% of incumbents were reelected.  PAC contributions to congressional candidates totaled $192
million, up 13% from 1994 contributions of $165.5 million, while individuals contributed $382
million, up 8% from the $335.7 million given by individuals in the 1994 election cycle.<p>

<p>

	"Because of the huge amount of money that pours into federal campaigns, too many of our elected
officials cater to the demands of special interests rather than to the concerns of the ordinary
citizen," said Claybrook. "The new Congress has the chance to confront the shameful excesses of
the 1996 campaign and to enact real campaign finance reform.  It cannot afford to let this window
of opportunity close without significantly reducing the staggering spending that the current system
permits." <p>

<h1><b><center>A MILLION FOR YOUR THOUGHTS:
The Industry-Funded Campaign Against
the FDA by Conservative Think Tanks</h1></center></b>
<p>
<p>
<h2><b>Executive Summary</h2></b>
<p>
For the past several years, a group of conservative think tanks with close ties to congressional Republicans has waged an aggressive public relations and lobbying campaign against the federal Food and Drug Administration. The campaign relies on misinforma
tion and distortion of the FDA's record. Between 1992 and 1995, seven of the think tanks received at least $3.5 million dollars in contributions from the industries with the most to gain from the anti-FDA campaign -- pharmaceutical, medical device, biotec
hnology and tobacco manufacturers.
<p>
The think tanks allege both that the FDA keeps Americans waiting for lifesaving therapies available to consumers in other countries, and that health and safety agencies in those countries approve drugs and devices more quickly than the FDA with no impact 
on safety. In fact, according to the U.S. General Accounting Office, the FDA approves drugs -- particularly drugs that offer a significant improvement in therapy -- as fast or faster than its counterparts in the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany. At the s
ame time, the FDA has done a much better job keeping dangerous, even lethal drugs off the U.S. market.
<p>
Despite this record, the anti-FDA campaign is close to bearing bitter fruit. Legislation is pending before the House and Senate that would dramatically weaken the FDA's ability to protect the public from unsafe or ineffective drugs, medical devices, blood
 products, food and food additives.
<p>
Public Citizen examined IRS tax forms, annual reports, fundraising materials and other publications from eight think tanks and dozens of corporations and corporate foundations. Weak disclosure requirements allow corporations to keep much of their contribu
tions hidden, but the documents reveal deep financial and institutional connections between the industries seeking to roll back FDA protections and the think tanks attacking the FDA.
<p><UL>
<LI> Seven think tanks -- the American Enterprise Institute, the Cato Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the Hudson Institute, the Progress and Freedom Foundation and the Washington Legal Foundation -- received at le
ast $3.5 million between 1992 and 1995 from drug, medical device, biotechnology and tobacco manufacturers and their corporate foundations.
<p>
<LI> Little specific funding information for the 1992-95 period is available for the eighth think tank -- Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE). However, CSE received $191,800 from Philip Morris in 1991 and the Chairman of CSE's board is a lobbyist for Amgen
, Inc., a major pharmaceutical and biotech company. CSE has reportedly spent $2 million since the beginning of 1995 on anti-FDA advertising, organizing and lobbying.
<p>
<LI> In addition to lending an aura of academic independence to industry-sponsored legislative proposals, the think tanks also wield significant political influence. Nominally nonpartisan, the organizations carrying out the public relations campaign again
st the FDA have very close links to the Republican Party:
<p>
     <b>Progress and Freedom Foundation (PFF):</b> An integral part of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's political network. The House leadership delayed introducing FDA legislation until PFF finished its proposed blueprint.
<p>
     <b>Hudson Institute:</b> Former Vice President Dan Quayle heads Hudson's Competitiveness Center. The center carries on the work of the Bush Administration's Council on Competitiveness by advocating the weakening of public health and safety laws espec
ially the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act.
<p>
     <b>Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE):</b> Former Bush Administration White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray -- now a lobbyist for Amgen, Inc. -- chairs the Board of Trustees for CSE, Inc. CSE has reportedly spent $2 million to roll back the FDA's author
ity to protect public health.
<p>
     <b>Washington Legal Foundation (WLF):</b> The House Commerce Committee, chaired by Rep. Tom Bliley (R-VA), is considering FDA rollback legislation. Bliley's staff counsel is Alan Slobodin, former president of WLF. WLF has placed misleading newspaper 
advertisements attacking the FDA's record and filed suit to force FDA to allow manufacturers to promote products for unapproved uses.
<p>
     <b>Heritage Foundation: </b>Now the think tank most frequently cited by major newspapers.  Several top Republican officials hold fellowships at Heritage, including Reagan-era Attorney General Edwin Meese and former Education Secretary and drug czar W
illiam Bennett. Heritage helped create the "Contract With America," which included a broad regulatory rollback bill that would have destroyed the FDA along with other public health and safety agencies.

</h2></b></center><p>
<p>
Washington, D.C., July 24, 1996 -- Public Citizen today released a new report showing that industries seeking to sharply limit the Food and Drug Administration's public health mission gave millions of dollars to conservative think tanks that have mounted 


a vitriolic anti-FDA public relations campaign.  The report details how these industry-funded think tanks generated and circulated a series of myths being used to justify pending legislation that would weaken the FDA's ability to protect the public from u


nsafe or ineffective drugs, medical devices, blood products and food additives. 
<p>
"The FDA rollback legislation would take consumers and patients back to the days of Thalidomide and the Dalkon Shield," said Joan Claybrook, President of Public Citizen.  "This report shows how the misleading case for this dangerous legislation has been m


anufactured by industries that stand to make huge additional profits.  By relying on industry-funded misinformation in crafting FDA legislation, Congress may well threaten the lives and well-being of millions of Americans."
<p>
<i>A Million for Your Thoughts: The Industry-Funded Campaign by Conservative Think Tanks Against the FDA</i> documents $3.5 million in contributions from pharmaceutical, medical device, biotechnology and tobacco companies and their corporate foundations t


o eight conservative think tanks since 1992.  Because limited disclosure requirements allow corporations to hide most of their gifts, actual funding is assumed to be much higher.
<p>
The think tanks -- American Enterprise Institute, Cato Institute, Citizens for a Sound Economy, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Heritage Foundation, Hudson Institute, Progress and Freedom Foundation, and Washington Legal Foundation -- also have close ti


es to the Republican Party.  Indeed, the House leadership delayed introducing its version of the FDA legislation until the Progress and Freedom Foundation, which has close ties to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, finished its blueprint for rollback.
<p>
Over the past two years the think tanks have mounted a costly public relations campaign against the FDA.  "Since corporations are not required to disclose their direct contributions, $3.5 million is certainly a gross underestimate," said John Canham-Clyne


, Research Director of Public Citizen's legislative arm, Congress Watch.  "But if you consider the impact these think tanks have had on the proposed FDA legislation, it's clear the industry donors got their money's worth."

<b>For Immediate Release				<p>

January 30, 1997					</b>	<p>

<p>

<center><h1>Auto Choice Makes Good Drivers Pay for Bad</h1><p>


<h2>
Nader Calls Insurance Companies Profiteers of the 1990s</h2><p>

<p>

</center>
"No fault" auto insurance systems have proved a financial, legal and philosophical disaster for motorists
across the United States, consumer advocates say, pointing to voluminous data on premiums and
litigation in no fault states. A "no fault"/"auto choice" conference in Washington, D.C. promoted by
insurance industry funded organizations and consultants, is the opening gambit in a public relations
campaign to rescue the failed no fault concept through federal legislation that would preempt state auto
insurance laws.<p>

<p>

Auto insurance companies are making huge profits while trying to limit recoveries by drivers. Based on
National Association of Insurance Commissioners' data, <u>Auto Insurance Report</u> has found that the profit
margins for auto insurance are rising. In 1989, the rate of return on net worth for auto insurers was 4.7%.
In 1995, the rate of return was 11.6%. In New York, the insurers made a profit of $841 million in 1995.
Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said, "To arbitrarily limit payments to innocent drivers while making
billions of dollars in profits is unconscionable. The insurance companies, seeking to impose limits on
wounded motorists, want no limits on their profiteering."<p>

<p>

No fault/auto choice would strip Americans of their right to legal representation if they are injured in an
auto accident and to have a citizen jury decide who should pay. No-fault means it's always your fault
because when an accident occurs each side submits a claim to his or her own insurer.<p>

<p>

Studies show that no fault increases premiums; does not reduce litigation costs; is extremely unpopular
with motorists; arbitrarily imposes harmful limits on full compensation, transferring the burden to
victims and ultimately taxpayers; contradicts traditional notions of responsibility and accountability; and
stacks the deck in the insurance companies' favor. (See attached fact sheet.)<p>

<p>

"No fault is an unfair and exceptionally costly system that defies the American tradition of justice and
fair play and forces good drivers to pay for bad drivers," says Nader. "It is ironic that members of
Congress would take a system that has collapsed in state after state, and been rejected by the people of
other states, and attempt to impose it on the entire nation through federal legislation."<p>

<p>

"To lower insurance premiums, the solution is first to improve auto and highway safety, " Nader said,
"second, to help reduce auto theft, and third, to promptly institute consumer protections against the
notorious price-gouging, waste and inefficiencies of the insurance industry, driven by its cost-plus
approach."<p>

<p>

"No fault is an experiment that has utterly failed," said Joan Claybrook, President of Public Citizen and
former Director of the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHTSA). "Auto
choice makes good drivers pay for bad drivers. It is a testament to the massive power and pervasive
influence of the insurance industry that no fault remains in effect in some states, where beleaguered
motorists want to escape its costly tyranny."<p>

<center>So-called "Consumer Choice" No Fault is a Fraud</b> </center>
<p>

<p>

With no fault facing extinction, insurance companies, which prosper under no fault, crafted the
"consumer's choice" plan as a palliative. Under the "choice" proposal, motorists ostensibly get to choose
whether they want "no fault" coverage or "traditional liability" coverage. But the promise of a "choice"
is an illusion; when a bad driver who causes an accident "chooses" fault-free insurance, that decision
overrides a good driver's choice to hold the bad driver accountable through the tort system. Thus,
"choice" really offers consumers no choice at all -- they are still subject to no fault.<p>

<p>

This proposal also tramples on states' rights, by imposing a Washington-Knows-Best auto insurance
scheme on the states. At present, the majority of states apportion fault in auto cases; their laws would be
run over by auto choice.<p>

<p>

<center><b>Industry Gears up for Federal Effort</b><p>

<p>

</center>
The insurance industry is gearing up a major political and public relations campaign to keep no fault
alive. One component of this campaign is a no fault/auto choice conference which begins today in
Washington, D.C. The conference is sponsored by the Auto Accident Compensation Project (AACP)
and a new group called The Committee for Comprehensive Automobile Restitution and Rate Reductions
(CAR). AACP is funded by the insurance industry; CAR is an unknown group. Many of the attendees
are consultants who have worked with the insurance industry to support no fault and oppose regulation
of the insurance industry. For example, corporate consultant Andrew Tobias worked closely with State
Farm and other insurance companies to unsuccessfully support industry-drafted no fault legislation in
Hawaii and California. University of Virginia Law Professor Jeffery O'Connell also campaigns on
behalf of insurance companies for various measures that restrict injured people's right to sue. In
California, for example, O'Connell was paid $67,000 by the insurance industry to unsuccessfully
support no fault legislation and to oppose the successful Proposition 103 rate regulation and roll back
law. And the latest "choice" no fault proposal is promoted by Michael Horowitz of the Hudson Institute,
which, like Horowitz's former employer, the Manhattan Institute, is funded by insurers and other big
corporations.<p>

<p>

"Unable to win support for no fault at the state level, the insurance industry wants the U.S. Congress to
adopt a no fault insurance system that has failed in every state it has been tried," said Harvey Rosenfield,
who authored California's insurance reform initiatives. "This shows how desperate the insurance
industry is to save no fault. This 'Auto Insurance Reform' conference, despite the effort to cloak it in an
academic guise, has been convened to buttress the insurance industry's no fault agenda. The
conference's failure to even discuss rate regulation and accountability reform, bitterly opposed by the
industry, but which has saved Californians billions of dollars in the last eight years, shows that it is the
insurance industry which is pulling this conference's strings. It is the insurance companies' interest in
fat profits and no accountability which is being protected by these lobbyists masquerading as reform
advocates," Rosenfield added.

<h1><center> <b>FACT SHEET ON NO FAULT AUTO INSURANCE</center></h1></b><p>

<p>

<b>1.	No fault increases premiums.</b> Insurance companies, which make most of their profits from the
investments of premiums, prefer no-fault because it generates higher revenues. <u>Paying the reckless</u> as
well as the innocent driver leads to far higher costs; restrictions on tort rights do not offset these higher
costs. On average, according to data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners,
premiums in mandatory no fault states rose 45.6% between 1989 and 1994, a third higher than the
average in liability states (33.7% increase). In 1994, six of the top ten most expensive auto insurance
states (including D.C.) had no fault systems.<p>

<p>

	States that repeal no fault obtain immediate rate <u>decreases</u>. Of the ten states where auto insurance was
the most expensive in 1989, eight were no fault states. Since then, three of those states -- Pennsylvania,
New Jersey and Connecticut -- have repealed their mandatory no fault systems (no fault remains
optional in Pennsylvania and New Jersey). Georgia repealed its no fault system in 1991; its average
premium dropped 4.8% between 1989 and 1994 -- the greatest decrease in the nation. Connecticut
repealed its no fault system effective January 1, 1994; rates dropped 9.7% that year.<p>

<p>

<b>2.	No fault does not reduce litigation costs. </b>One of the great myths of no fault -- that it dramatically
reduces litigation -- is belied by the facts. In no fault states, suits by motorists against their own
insurance company for failure to pay no fault benefits have skyrocketed. An article in the Insurance
Council Journal, a publication for insurance defense attorneys, concluded: "Whatever the advantages of
no fault, a reduction in court cases and court costs would not appear to be one of them." (July, 1986,
Page 389). During the period 1977-89, of the 1,119 appellate opinions in Michigan dealing with no-fault, a whopping 73% (826) were first party cases in which insurers wound up having to sue their own
insurance company to receive benefits. Sinas, George T., "No-Fault: a Perspective From Michigan," June 30, 1990. P. 15. Traditional no fault systems also spawn enormous litigation over
whether a particular individual has met the threshold over which claims for pain and suffering may be
requested. Another 22% of the reported cases (241) in Michigan concerned the bodily injury threshold
requirement, where the question was whether a suit could be appropriately filed against a third party
because the injuries were serious enough.Id. Moreover, litigation over property damage  -- the vast
majority of car accidents involve property damage -- continues under traditional no fault systems which
retain the liability system for property claims.<p>

<p>

<b>3.	No Fault is extremely unpopular with motorists.</b> No state has adopted a no fault law since 1976. Four
states have repealed their mandatory no fault systems since 1989. Voters have rejected no fault proposals
by landslide margins twice in California (1988 and 1996). In recent years, motorists in Hawaii and
Massachusetts have petitioned their legislature to get rid of no fault.<p>

<b><p>

4.	No fault arbitrarily imposes harmful limits on full compensation, transferring the cost of
irresponsibility to victims and ultimately taxpayers. </b>No fault places cruel, arbitrary and unjustified
restrictions on the compensation victims of auto accidents may receive by eliminating non-economic
damages, commonly known as pain and suffering damages. Under auto choice, motorists who suffer
gross disfigurement, blindness or permanent loss of health most likely would go uncompensated for such
losses. Consumers could buy insurance to cover pain and suffering damages, but it would be so
expensive that most people would forgo this false "choice."  Eliminating pain and suffering damages is
particularly unfair to women, children, seniors and people of modest means, because they tend to receive
most of their compensation in the form of pain and suffering. For example, pregnant women who are hit
by a driver and become permanently sterilized would only be entitled to limited compensation for
medical costs, but not pain and suffering. (And if the person was a homemaker, she would receive
virtually nothing other than payment of medical bills, since she would not be entitled to wages.)<p>

<p>

<b>5.	No fault makes good drivers pay for bad drivers. </b>Under the "choice" proposal, motorists ostensibly
get to choose whether they want "no fault" coverage or "traditional liability" coverage. But the promise
of a "choice" is an illusion; when a bad driver who causes an accident "chooses" fault-free insurance,
that decision overrides a good driver's choice to hold the bad driver accountable through the tort system.
Thus, "choice" really offers consumers no choice at all -- they are still subject to no fault.<p>

<p>

<b>6.	No fault leads to more accidents.</b> Studies suggests that no fault leads to more
accidents. In their 1987 book <i>The Economic Structure of Tort Law</i>,
conservative theorists William M. Landes and Richard A. Posner found that
tort law leads to lower accident rates because if the incentive to take care is
reduced, people will be less careful, and the cumulatively significant result
will be more fatal accidents. Another  recent study concludes that no fault
encourages drunk driving. ("Effects of Tort Liability and Insurance on Heavy
Drinking and Driving," Sloan, at al., Journal of Law and Economics (April,
1995)). Indeed a review of such studies, published in the UCLA Law Review,
concluded that auto fatalities and drunk driving increase in states that adopt no
fault because individual drivers are no longer responsible -- or made to pay --
for their reckless driving (Gary T. Schwartz, "Reality in the Economic
Analysis of Tort Law: Does Tort Law Really Deter?" 42 UCLA Law Review
377 (1994)).<p>

<p>

<b>7.	No fault's benefits are too limited, forcing motorists to buy more
insurance. </b> Since paying both parties to a vehicle collision is an inherently
more expensive system, no fault plans often mandate extremely limited
benefits, leaving victims with little protection. Most motorists must buy
additional coverage, including, in states that allow litigation, liability coverage
to protect themselves against lawsuits by other motorists whose no fault
benefits are inadequate. While proponents of no fault often hold out the
promise of generous benefits as a quid-pro-quo for surrendering legal rights,
the high cost of no fault inevitability leads to industry pressure to reduce
benefits, leaving motorists holding policies that offer dwindling protection.<p>

<p>

<b>8.	No fault stacks the deck in the insurance companies' favor.</b> All no fault
proposals, in practice,  leave the injured person to face clever insurance
adjusters without the leverage of adequate legal remedies -- undermining the
power that consumers have when demanding an insurance company to fully
and promptly pay claims. The elimination of compensation for accident
victims' pain and suffering removes the incentive for scrupulous lawyers to
accept auto accident cases, since their fees would then have to be paid out of
the victim's recovery of medical costs and lost wages. One of the unstated but
obvious purposes of no fault proposals is to discourage lawyers from
representing accident victims, no matter how serious their cases. Without the
ready availability of such representation, insurers will have little reason to
eschew abusive settlement practices. Since insurers have a financial incentive
to deny claims -- they earn most of their profits from the investment of
premiums -- the threat of a financial penalty is often the only leverage a
policyholder can wield to force an insurance company to comply with its legal
obligations.<p>

<p>

<b>9. 	Regulating excessive insurance company profits and overhead is the best
way to lower auto insurance premiums.</b> California voters ordered such
measures eight years ago. As a result, the average auto insurance premium in
California dropped 4.5% between 1989 and 1994, saving motorists $12
billion. (During the same period, premiums increased an average of 37%
throughout the rest of the nation.) An additional $1 billion in premium refunds
have been paid. California, which used to have the fastest growing premiums
in the nation, now ranks 47th.

<b>The Supreme Court Assistance Project</b> was founded to try to
rectify what the Litigation Group perceived to be a gross imbalance
in the practice before the Supreme Court.  Typically, business
clients are exceptionally well-represented before the Court, often
by experienced Supreme Court practitioners, backed by all of the
resources large corporations can offer.  More often than not, on
the other side are small firm practitioners or legal service
attorneys with little or no Supreme Court experience.  Our theory
is to help equalize this imbalance by lending our experience and
expertise in Supreme Court Practice to the underdog, while at the
same time not attempting to take over the case.<p>

Through SCAP, the Litigation Group provides assistance to small
firm practitioners, legal service lawyers, and other lawyers with
little or no experience in Supreme Court litigation.  Because many
attorneys arguing in front of the Supreme Court have little or no
experience in practicing before the Supreme Court, our expertise
and knowledge is a valuable resource to litigants. SCAP attempts to
ensure that the litigants assisted present the Supreme Court with
the strongest possible arguments prior to its decision.  SCAP
focuses on identifying cases with the potential for broad public
impact.<p>

SCAP provides assistance to attorneys who were not successful in
the lower court and are considering requesting that the Supreme
Court review the case through a petition for certiorari.  The
Supreme Court agrees to hear less than 5% of the cases in which
petitions for certiorari are filed, and in approximately two-thirds
of the cases in which review is granted there is a reversal.<p>

SCAP also provides pre-certiorari assistance to attorneys who were
successful in the lower court to preserve their victory by helping
them write briefs arguing that the Supreme Court should not grant
the other side's petition for certiorari.  These cases often
involve claims of government misconduct, union workers, prisoners
or civil rights plaintiffs who have won damage awards based on some
violation of their rights.  SCAP also focuses on seemingly
technical legal issues <i>(such as jurisdiction, procedure, and
statutory construction)</i> which have the potential to establish
roadblocks that could limit the procedural rights of
many parties.<p>

If the Supreme Court agrees to hear a case, SCAP assists attorneys
in writing briefs and preparing for oral argument, including
organizing moot courts.  During the 1994-1995 term, SCAp was
involved in approximately 30 cases in which the Court granted
certiorari.<p>

If you are aware of cases that are likely to be presented to the
Court and the lawyer may need a little technical assistance, by all
means, encourage the lawyer to contact us.  Or if you find yourself
with a case that appears to be headed to the High Court and you
could use some advice about any matter -- procedural or substantive
-- just let us know.<p>

<p>
    Spend your first year out of law school working on Supreme
Court cases for public interest firm with substantial Supreme
Court practice.  Job available approximately <b>August 1997-
August 1998</b>.<p>

    The Public Citizen Litigation Group, a Washington public
interest office of 10 lawyers founded by Ralph Nader and Alan
Morrison in 1972, operates a Supreme Court Assistance Project
to help small firm practitioners, legal services lawyers, and
other lawyers with little or no experience in Supreme Court
litigation.  The Project provides direct assistance to those
lawyers both before review is granted, either by helping with
the cert. petition or the brief in opposition, and, in those
cases in which review is granted, working with the lawyers on
the briefs and oral arguments.  In rare cases, the principal
role is assumed by a Litigation Group attorney, but generally
the Group's role is advisory.  We are looking for a recent law
school graduate for the position of <i>Project
Coordinator.</i><p>

    The work of the Coordinator focuses on identifying the
cases warranting assistance.  The Project seeks cases in which
important legal principles are at stake, and where the
attorneys for the side that we support  generally that of the
underdog  may lack significant Supreme Court experience. 
Most, but not all, of the cases are civil, rather than
criminal.  So far, most of the pre-grant cases involve
assistance to the party who won below, where our role is to
help devise a strategy to keep the case out of the Court and
thereby preserve a victory.  Increasingly, we have found ways
to broaden our work by reaching potential petitioners who
might wish to use our services.<p>

    The person who serves as Project Coordinator will spend a
substantial portion of his or her time reading all cert.
petitions, other than those filed <i>in forma pauperis</i>,
which are generally criminal cases.  Working under the direct
supervision of the Group's senior lawyer, the Coordinator
makes an initial judgment about whether the case is of no,
little, or considerable interest to the Project, and then
prepares a memo on those in which there may be some interest. 
Additional research and analysis are sometimes required to
determine whether assertions, such as a conflict among the
courts of appeals, are supportable.  The Coordinator then
makes an initial contact with the attorney to whom help is
being offered to explain the Project and the assistance that
we provide.  All cases accepted by the Court for full review
are considered for possible assistance by the Project.<p>

    Where our offer of help is accepted, one of the Group's
attorneys assumes principal responsibility for the case within
the office.  To the extent that the Coordinator has time, he
or she is encouraged to participate fully in all aspects of
the Project, including reading draft briefs and commenting on
them, conducting research (usually on discrete issues),
participating in moot courts, and attending oral arguments. 
From time to time, the Coordinator has worked, and will
continue to work, on other Litigation Group cases, either in
the Supreme Court or elsewhere.<p> 

    The salary is $27,720 (possibly somewhat more for
experienced applicants), plus fully paid comprehensive health
insurance and two weeks vacation.  An outside gift to help
repay student loans may also be available.  Applicants should
have a solid academic background, good writing and analytical
skills, and a knowledge of a wide range of subject areas that
arise in Supreme Court litigation (but not in depth).  Some
practical litigation experience in school or elsewhere is
preferred, but not required.  A strong preference will be
given to those who have a demonstrated commitment to public
interest work.  Minorities are strongly encouraged to
apply.<p>

    Applicants should send a cover letter, along with a
resume, a list of references, a copy of law school transcript,
and a writing sample to Brian Wolfman, staff attorney, at the
above address.  The writing sample should be legal in nature
(brief, memorandum, or research paper) and should be the
applicant's own work, not a collaborative piece or something
heavily edited by someone else.  Applications should be
received <b>no later than November 22, 1996</b>.  Interviews
will be either a lengthy telephone interview with several
people from our staff, or in-person.  Interviews will take
place in mid-December through early January, with the hope
that a decision will be made by early February.<p>

    Public Citizen is a no-smoking office.<p>

Sample FOIA Appeal Letter</A>]</CENTER>

<BR>

<P> <STRONG>The Freedom of Information Act</STRONG> was enacted by
Congress in 1966
to give the public access to information held by the federal
government. The Act gives any person the right to request and
receive any document, file or other record in the possession of any
agency of the federal government, subject to nine specific
objections. While the federal Act does not apply to state
governments, each state has its own laws governing disclosure of
records held by state and local government bodies.
<P>    The federal government is a vast storehouse of untapped
information. First, such information is necessary to inform the
public about what the government is or is not doing with regard to
matters of public concern. Access to such information is the
lifeblood of democracy. Second, government records often contain
facts that can be helpful to organizations, businesses, and
individual citizens. Regulatory agencies, for instance, have a
large amount of data such as inspection reports, individual files,
tests on a broad spectrum of goods and services and data submitted
by industry on such subjects as pollution or nuclear safety.
<P>    This brochure provides a general description of the federal
Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") and specific guidelines on how
to use it effectively.<BR>
<BR>
<H2><CENTER><A NAME="HOWTO">HOW TO MAKE A REQUEST</A></CENTER></H2>
<P>    <STRONG>(1)</STRONG> The first step is to determine what you
want, since the
law requires that your request must "reasonably describe" the
records you seek. This means that you may not simply ask questions
but must request records describing or pertaining to a particular
subject. You do not need to specify a document by name or title,
but you must provide a reasonable enough description to allow
government employees who are familiar with the agencies' files to
locate the records you seek. For example, if you want information
on nursing homes in your area and know that the government requires
some sort of annual surveys to be conducted on nursing homes, it is
sufficient to ask that you want to see the surveys and all records
pertaining to the surveys for particular years and/or regions.
Agencies are not obligated to create a record to respond to your
request, but only to provide existing records. A record is
information in any format, including maps, photographs and computer
disks.
<P>    <STRONG>(2)</STRONG> The second step is to decide which
agency has the
information you want and the address to write to within the agency.
There is no central government FOIA office; each agency has its own
office or public information staff. There is no special way of
determining which agency has the information other than common
sense and telephone calls to various agencies. You may also want to
check the Code of Federal Regulations, which contains the FOIA
regulations for each agency, and can be found in law libraries and
many public libraries. When you have found the agency which has the
information, determine the address of the office which processes
Freedom of Information Act requests. Send your request to all
agencies or agency field offices that may have the information you
seek.
<P>    <STRONG>(3)</STRONG> Your request should state that it is
being made pursuant
to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. Sec. 552) and, if you
are requesting records about yourself, pursuant to the Privacy Act
(5 U.S.C. Sec. 552a) as well. To request records about yourself,
you may ask for "all records pertaining to me." For requests to the
FBI you must include your full name, address, date and place of
birth, and social security number and have your signature notarized
by a notary public. For all requests, you should write "Freedom of
Information Request" (or Appeal) on the envelope and on the letter
and you should retain a copy for your files. You do not have to
explain the reasons for your request, and government employees
generally do not have any right to ask (unless you are seeking a
waiver of fees).<BR>
<BR>
<H2><CENTER><A NAME="COSTS">COSTS</A></CENTER></H2>
<P>    The Act provides that agencies may charge different fees
depending on who is requesting the information. Commercial users
pay reasonable standard charges for document search, review and
duplication. Educational or noncommercial scientific institutions
and representatives of the news media may only be charged for
reasonable duplication costs. $.10-$.25 per page is reasonable. All
other users may be charged for document search and duplication;
however, except for commercial users, the first two hours of search
time and the first hundred pages of copying are free. To save money
on reproduction expenses, you can ask to see the documents
themselves instead of having copies sent.
<P>    Regardless of the above categories, you may be entitled to
a
waiver or reduction of fees if, according to the Act, "disclosure
of the information is in the public interest because it is likely
to contribute significantly to public understanding of the
operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in
the commercial interest of the requester." In requesting a fee
waiver, you should explain why you are seeking the information and
how your access to it will further public understanding or
awareness of government activities.
<P>     If you are denied a fee waiver or if an agency grants an
unsatisfactory reduction of fees, ask the agency to justify its
actions. Fee issues may be appealed and are also subject to
judicial review.<BR>
<BR>
<H2><CENTER><A NAME="RESPONSE">THE AGENCY
RESPONSE</A></H2></CENTER>
<P>    The law sets specific deadlines for replying to Freedom of
Information requests: 10 working days on the initial request and 20
working days on the administrative appeal. Nevertheless, delay is
common. Even though the law says that an agency may receive a time
extension only in exceptional circumstances, agencies extend these
deadlines regularly. However, if an agency fails to respond
substantively to your request within 10 working days, you may treat
the request as denied and immediately appeal or go to court. Many
agencies require that appeals be filed within 30 days. Unless you
are aware of a different time limit, you should file your appeal
letter within 30 days. Although it is legal to file suit after 10
working days if an agency has failed to make a determination on
your request, most courts view this as unreasonable. If your
request has been excessively delayed, it is generally better to
send an appeal letter before going to court. If the request has
been denied in part or in full then you must appeal before a
lawsuit can be filed. A lawsuit may take a year or more, and thus
coaxing the information out of the agency is preferable to going to
court. Following up written requests with phone calls can speed up
your request. If agencies are aware that you know your rights, they
will sometimes move more quickly. For your files, keep a written
record of all phone contact with the agency processing your
request.
<P>    Under the FOIA, an agency may deny your request if you have
failed to reasonably describe the documents; the agency has
conducted a reasonable search and determined that the requested
documents do not exist or are not in the possession or control of
the agency; or the documents are specifically covered by one of the
Act's nine exemptions. If the agency claims you have inadequately
described the documents you seek, you should rewrite your request
more precisely and resubmit it and/or contact the official
processing your request to describe it more fully, especially if
you are reasonably certain the documents do exist.<BR>
<BR>
<H2><CENTER><A NAME="EXEMPTIONS">THE NINE
EXEMPTIONS</A></CENTER></H2>
<P>    If the agency withholds some or all of the records you seek
it
must do so under one or more of the nine exemptions listed below.
You may challenge an agency's decision to withhold the records by
appealing any denial. Moreover, agencies may, in their discretion,
release records even though they are covered by an exemption.

<H3>(1) National Security</H3>
<P>    The documents exempt under this section are those that are
properly classified pursuant to a Presidential Executive Order. If
you are requesting a document which the agency tells you is
classified, you may want to ask that the reasons for classification
be re-examined, as the agency may determine there is no longer a
need for secrecy, at least as to some parts of the records in
question.<BR>


<H3>(2) Internal Agency Rules</H3>
<P>    This exemption protects rules and practices of agency
personnel that are "predominantly internal" in nature and, where
disclosure serves no substantial public interest and significantly
risks circumvention of agency regulations or statutes. Thus, minor
employee matters such as employee parking and cafeteria regulations
are exempt.<BR>


<H3>(3) Information Exempted by Another Federal Statute</H3>
<P>    This exemption honors mandatory nondisclosure provisions in
other laws. There is no comprehensive list of all laws covered by
exemption 3, but examples include laws governing income tax returns
and completed census bureau forms.<BR>

<H3>(4) Trade Secrets</H3>
<P>    Agencies withhold information if it is either a trade secret
or confidential commercial or financial information. This exemption
is often invoked by such agencies as the EPA, FDA and other
regulatory agencies which receive information from companies.
Information which can be proven to be a trade secret is absolutely
protected. For commercial or financial information, the government
must prove that the information is not customarily disclosed to the
public by the company and that its disclosure would be likely
either to impair the agency's ability to obtain information in the
future or to cause substantial competitive injury to the submitter.
Confidential or financial information that companies give
voluntarily to the government may be exempt, whether or not the
government could compel submission of the information.<BR>


<H3>(5) Internal Agency Memoranda</H3>
<P>    This exemption protects information about an agency's
decision-making process. Thus, advice and recommendations involving
a "deliberative process" on legal and policy matters may be
withheld, but the segregable, factual portions of documents should
be disclosed. Preliminary drafts and unfinished reports may be
withheld, but final decisions and memos on which they are based
must generally be disclosed. Thus, a memo from a staff person to a
supervisor recommending that a particular policy be established
would be exempt from disclosure. But the factual portions of this
memo would not be exempt unless they reveal the deliberative
decision-making process of the agency.<BR>

<H3>(6) Personal Privacy</H3>
<P>    This exemption involves a balancing of the public's interest
in disclosure against the degree of invasion of privacy which would
result from disclosure. If your request involves this exemption,
you should provide a brief explanation of the public benefits from
disclosure, how disclosure sheds light on government activities, so
that it can be determined whether any invasion of privacy resulting
from disclosure would be "clearly unwarranted."<BR>


<H3>(7) Investigatory Records</H3>
<P>    This exemption protects information compiled for law
enforcement purposes which could reasonably be expected to
interfere with enforcement proceedings, to identify a confidential
source, to disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement
investigations or to invade personal privacy.<BR>


<H3>(8) & (9) Other Exemptions</H3>
<P>    These are two special-interest exemptions relating to
banking
and oil well information which are not relevant to most
applications of the Act.
<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Under certain circumstances an agency may
state that it
has no records subject to your request, even though it does in fact
have some relevant record. For example, under exemption 1 (national
security), the government can refuse to acknowledge the existence
of classified records if the mere existence of records is
classified. Under exemption 7 (investigatory records) where a
subject is not aware of a criminal investigation and disclosure
could interfere with law enforcement proceedings, the government
can refuse to state whether such records exist.<BR>
<BR>
<H2><CENTER><A NAME="APPEAL">HOW TO MAKE AN
APPEAL</A></CENTER></H2>
<P>    If your request is partially or entirely denied, you may
appeal within the agency or department. The denial letter should
inform you of appeal procedures and the proper address to send your
appeal letter. An appeal letter should attach and describe copies
of the request and the denial, state that an appeal is being made
of the agency's initial denial, and if you can, explain why the
denial was unwarranted, either because the exemption does not apply
or because the agency should use its discretion to release the
records anyway.<BR>
<BR>
<H2><CENTER><A NAME="COURT">GOING TO COURT</A></CENTER></H2>
<P>    The Act is designed to make litigation as simple as
possible.
In some instances, taking a FOIA case to court is not overly
complicated and requesters can do it themselves without a lawyer.
However, it is more helpful to have a lawyer if you litigate in
court. After your appeal is denied, or after 20 working days have
elapsed from the time the agency received your appeal, you may sue
in the United States District Court where you live, where the
documents are located, or in the District of Columbia. If the
government cannot prove that the requested documents fall within
one of nine exemptions from the Act's mandatory disclosure
requirement, then the Court will order the agency to give the
documents to you. Even if you lose, the agency may release more
documents along the way. If you win, the Court may require the
government to pay your attorney's fees if you incur any.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H2><CENTER><A NAME="PRIVACY">THE PRIVACY ACT</A></CENTER></H2>
<P>    In 1974 Congress enacted the federal <STRONG>Privacy Act, 5
U.S.C.
Sec. 552a,</STRONG> which, on the one hand, requires the government
to
protect personal information from misuses and unauthorized
disclosure, and, on the other hand, establishes a right of access
for individuals to their own files, and a right to seek correction
of those files. The exception to an individual's right of access
are fewer than those in the Freedom of Information Act. However,
law enforcement agencies and the CIA are completely exempt from the
individual access provisions, there is no specific time limit for
an agency's initial response to a request, and only U.S. citizens
or permanent resident aliens may obtain access to records. Requests
for your own file should invoke both the Freedom of Information Act
and the Privacy Act. Neither the Privacy Act nor the FOIA can be
used to deny access under the other statute.<BR>

<HR>
<BR>
<H2><CENTER><A NAME="SUNSHINE">THE SUNSHINE AND ADVISORY COMMITTEE
ACTS</A>
</H2></CENTER>
<P>    There are two other important federal open meetings laws.
The
<STRONG>Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552b,</STRONG> requires
agencies such as the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission to announce their meetings ahead of time and to open
them to the public unless one of ten specific exemptions applies to
particular discussions. Similarly, the Federal Advisory Committee
Act, 5 U.S.C. App. II, contains the same requirements regarding
meetings of outside groups advising Federal agencies and subjects
advisory committee records to the FOIA.<BR>

<center><b>ELECTRONIC FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF
1996</center></b>

<pre>
     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

     This Act may be cited as the ``Electronic Freedom of
Information Act Amendments of 1996''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

     (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
     (1) the purpose of section 552 of title 5, United States Code,
popularly known as the Freedom of Information Act, is to require
agencies of the Federal Government to make certain agency
information available for public inspection and copying and to
establish and enable enforcement of the right of any person to
obtain access to the records of such agencies, subject to statutory
exemptions, for any public or private purpose;
     (2) since the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act in
1966, and the amendments enacted in 1974 and 1986, the Freedom of
Information Act has been a valuable means through which any person
can learn how the Federal Government
 operates;
     (3) the Freedom of Information Act has led to the
 disclosure of waste, fraud, abuse, and wrongdoing in the Federal
Government;
     (4) the Freedom of Information Act has led to the
 identification of unsafe consumer products, harmful drugs, and
serious health hazards;
     (5) Government agencies increasingly use computers to conduct
agency business and to store publicly valuable agency records and
information; and
     (6) Government agencies should use new technology to enhance
public access to agency records and information.
     (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--
     (1) foster democracy by ensuring public access to agency
records and information;

notice and receipt of public comment, providing for multitrack
processing of requests for records based on the amount of work or
time (or both) involved in processing requests.
     ``(ii) Regulations under this subparagraph may provide a
person making a request that does not qualify for the fastest
multitrack processing an opportunity to limit the scope of the
request in order to qualify for faster processing.
     ``(iii) This subparagraph shall not be considered to affect
the requirement under subparagraph (C) to exercise due
diligence.''.
     (b) Unusual Circumstances.--Section 552(a)(6)(B) of title 5,
United States Code, is amended to read as follows:
     ``(B)(i) In unusual circumstances as specified in this
subparagraph, the time limits prescribed in either clause (i) or
clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) may be extended by written notice
to the person making such request setting forth the unusual
circumstances for such extension and the date on which a
determination is expected to be dispatched. No such notice shall
specify a date that would result in an extension for more than ten
working days, except as provided in clause (ii) of this
subparagraph.
     ``(ii) With respect to a request for which a written notice
under clause (i) extends the time limits prescribed under clause
(i) of subparagraph (A), the agency shall notify the person making
the request if the request cannot be processed within the time
limit specified in that clause and shall provide the person an
opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be
processed within that time limit or an opportunity to arrange with
the agency an alternative time frame for processing the request or
a modified request. Refusal by the person to reasonably modify the
request or arrange such an alternative time frame shall be
considered as a factor in determining whether exceptional
circumstances exist for purposes of subparagraph (C).
     ``(iii) As used in this subparagraph, `unusual circumstances'
means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper
processing of the particular requests--
     ``(I) the need to search for and collect the requested records
from field facilities or other establishments that are separate
from the office processing the request;
     ``(II) the need to search for, collect, and appropriately
examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which
are demanded in a single request; or
     ``(III) the need for consultation, which shall be conducted
with all practicable speed, with another agency having a
substantial interest in the determination of the request or among
two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-
matter interest therein.
     ``(iv) Each agency may promulgate regulations, pursuant to
notice and receipt of public comment, providing for the aggregation
of certain requests by the same requestor, or by a group of
requestors acting in concert, if the agency reasonably believes
that such requests actually constitute a single request, which
would otherwise satisfy the unusual circumstances specified in this
subparagraph, and the
requests involve clearly related matters. Multiple requests
involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.''.
     (c) Exceptional Circumstances.--Section 552(a)(6)(C) of title
5, United States Code, is amended by inserting ``(i)'' after
``(C)'', and by adding at the end the following new clauses:
     ``(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term
`exceptional circumstances' does not include a delay that results
from a predictable agency workload of requests under this section,
unless the agency demonstrates reasonable progress in reducing its
backlog of pending requests.
     ``(iii) Refusal by a person to reasonably modify the scope of
a request or arrange an alternative time frame for processing a
request (or a modified request) under clause (ii) after being given
an opportunity to do so by the agency to whom the person made the
request shall be considered as a factor in determining whether
exceptional circumstances exist for purposes of this
subparagraph.''.

     ``(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), regulations under this
subparagraph must ensure--
     ``(I) that a determination of whether to provide expedited
processing shall be made, and notice of the determination shall be
provided to the person making the request, within 10 days after the
date of the request; and
     ``(II) expeditious consideration of administrative appeals of
such determinations of whether to provide expedited processing.
     ``(iii) An agency shall process as soon as practicable any
request for records to which the agency has granted expedited
processing under this subparagraph. Agency action to deny or affirm
denial of a request for expedited processing pursuant to this
subparagraph, and failure by an agency to respond in a timely
manner to such a request shall be subject to
judicial review under paragraph (4), except that the judicial
review shall be based on the record before the agency at the time
of the determination.
     ``(iv) A district court of the United States shall not have
jurisdiction to review an agency denial of expedited processing of
a request for records after the agency has provided a complete
response to the request.
     ``(v) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term
`compelling need' means--
     ``(I) that a failure to obtain requested records on an
expedited basis under this paragraph could reasonably be expected
to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an
individual; or
     ``(II) with respect to a request made by a person primarily
engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public
concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.

Comply With a Request.--Section 552(a)(6)(A)(i) of title 5, United
States Code, is amended by striking ``ten days'' and inserting ``20
days''.

the end the following new subparagraph:
     ``(F) In denying a request for records, in whole or in part,
an agency shall make a reasonable effort to estimate the volume of
any requested matter the provision of which is denied, and shall
provide any such estimate to the person making the request, unless
providing such estimate would harm an interest protected by the
exemption in subsection (b) pursuant to which the denial is
made.''.

     SEC. 9. COMPUTER REDACTION.

     Section 552(b) of title 5, United States Code, is amended in
the matter following paragraph (9) by inserting after the period
the following: ``The amount of information deleted shall be

that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption
in this subsection under which the deletion is made. If technically
feasible, the amount of the information deleted shall be indicated

 Clinton Memorandum on Administration of Freedom of Information Act

 Contact: The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, 
          202-456-2100 

 Oct. 4, 1993 
 
 MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES 
 
 SUBJECT: The Freedom of Information Act 
 
   I am writing to call your attention to a subject that is of great 
importance to the American public and to all Federal departments and 
agencies -- the administration of the Freedom of Information Act, as 
amended (the "Act").  The Act is a vital part of the participatory 
system of government.  I am committed to enhancing its effectiveness 
in my Administration. 
 
   For more than a quarter century now, the Freedom of Information 
Act has played a unique role in strengthening our democratic form of 
government.  The statute was enacted based upon the fundamental 
principle that an informed citizenry is essential to the democratic 
process and that the more the American people know about their 
government the better they will be governed.  Openness in government 
is essential to accountability and the Act has become an integral 
part of that process. 
 
   The Freedom of Information Act, moreover, has been one of the 
primary means by which members of the public inform themselves about 
their government.  As Vice President Gore made clear in the National 
Performance Review, the American people are the Federal Government's 
customers.  Federal departments and agencies should handle requests 
for information in a customer-friendly manner.  The use of the Act by 
ordinary citizens is not complicated, nor should it be.  The 
existence of unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles has no place in its 
implementation. 
 
   I therefore call upon all Federal departments and agencies to 
renew their commitment to the Freedom of Information Act, to its 
underlying principles of government openness, and to its sound 
administration.  This is an appropriate time for all agencies to take 
a fresh look at their administration of the Act, to reduce backlogs 
of Freedom of Information Act requests, and to conform agency 
practice to the new litigation guidance issued by the Attorney 
General, which is attached. 
 
   Further, I remind agencies that our commitment to openness 
requires more than merely responding to requests from the public. 
Each agency has a responsibility to distribute information on its own 
initiative, and to enhance public access through the use of 
electronic information systems.  Taking these steps will ensure 
compliance with both the letter and spirit of the Act. 
 
 (s) William J. Clinton 
 
                          ------ 
 
 Oct. 4, 1993 
 
 MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES 
 
 Subject: The Freedom of Information Act 
 
   President Clinton has asked each Federal department and agency to 
take steps to ensure it is in compliance with both the letter and the 
spirit of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552.  The 
Department of Justice is fully committed to this directive and stands 
ready to assist all agencies as we implement this new policy. 
 
   First and foremost, we must ensure that the principle of openness 
in government is applied in each and every disclosure and 
nondisclosure decision that is required under the Act.  Therefore, I 
hereby rescind the Department of Justice's 1981 guidelines for the 
defense of agency action in Freedom of Information Act litigation. 
The Department will no longer defend an agency's withholding of 
information merely because there is a "substantial legal basis" for 
doing so.  Rather, in determining whether or not to defend a 
nondisclosure decision, we will apply a presumption of disclosure. 
 
   To be sure, the Act accommodates, through its exemption structure, 
the countervailing interests that can exist in both disclosure and 
nondisclosure of government information.  Yet while the Act's 
exceptions are designed to guard against harm to governmental and 
private interests, I firmly believe that these exemptions are best 
applied with specific reference to such harm, and only after 
consideration of the reasonably expected consequences of disclosure 
in each particular case. 
 
   In short, it shall be the policy of the U.S. Department of Justice 
to defend the assertion of a FOIA exemption only in those cases where 
the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would be harmful to an 
interest protected by that exemption.  Where an item of information 
might technically or arguably fall within an exemption, it ought not 
to be withheld from a FOIA requester unless it need be. 
 
   It is my belief that this change in policy serves the public 
interest by achieving the Act's primary objective -- maximum 
responsible disclosure of government information -- while preserving 
essential confidentiality.  Accordingly, I strongly encourage your 
FOIA officers to make "discretionary disclosures" whenever possible 
under the Act.  Such disclosures are possible under a number of FOIA 
exemptions, especially when only a governmental interest would be 
affected.  The exemptions and opportunities for "discretionary 
disclosures" are discussed in the Discretionary Disclosure and Waiver 
section of the "Justice Department Guide to the Freedom of 
Information Act." As that discussion points out, agencies can make 
discretionary FOIA disclosures as a matter of good public policy 
without concern for future "waiver consequences" for similar 
information.  Such disclosures can also readily satisfy an agency's 
"reasonable segregation" obligation under the Act in connection with 
marginally exempt information, see 5 U.S.C. 552(b), and can lessen an 
agency's administrative burden at all levels of the administrative 
process and in litigation.  I note that this policy is not intended 
to create any substantive or procedural rights enforceable at law. 
 
   In connection with the repeal of the 1981 guidelines, I am 
requesting that the Assistant Attorneys General for the Department's 
Civil and Tax Divisions, as well as the United States Attorneys, 
undertake a review of the merits of all pending FOIA cases handled by 
them, according to the standards set forth above.  The Department's 
litigating attorneys will strive to work closely with your general 
counsels and their litigation staffs to implement this new policy on 
a case-by-case basis.  The Department's office of Information and 
Privacy can also be called upon for assistance in this process, as 
well as for policy guidance to agency FOIA officers. 
 
   In addition, at the Department of Justice we are undertaking a 
complete review and revision of our regulations implementing the 
FOIA, all related regulations pertaining to the Privacy Act of 1974, 
5 U.S.C. 552a, as well as the Department's disclosure policies 
generally.  We are also planning to conduct a Department-wide "FOIA 
Form Review." Envisioned is a comprehensive review of all standard 
FOIA forms and correspondence utilized by the Justice Department's 
various components.  These items will be reviewed for their 
correctness, completeness, consistency and particularly for their use 
of clear language.  As we conduct this review, we will be especially 
mindful that FOIA requesters are users of a government service, 
participants in an administrative process, and constituents of our 
democratic society.  I encourage you to do likewise at your 
departments and agencies. 
 
   Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to raise with you 
the longstanding problem of administrative backlogs under the Freedom 
of Information Act.  Many Federal departments and agencies are often 
unable to meet the Act's ten-day time limit for processing FOIA 
requests, and some agencies -- especially those dealing with 
high-volume demands for particularly sensitive records -- maintain 
large FOIA backlogs greatly exceeding the mandated time period.  The 
reasons for this may vary, but principally it appears to be a problem 
of too few resources in the face of too heavy a workload.  This is a 
serious problem -- one of growing concern and frustration to both 
FOIA requesters and Congress, and to agency FOIA officers as well. 
 
   It is my hope that we can work constructively together, with 
Congress and the FOIA-requester community, to reduce backlogs during 
the coming year.  To ensure that we have a clear and current 
understanding of the situation, I am requesting that each of you send 
to the Department's Office of Information and Privacy a copy of your 
agency's Annual FOIA Report to Congress for 1992.  Please include 
with this report a letter describing the extent of any present FOIA 
backlog, FOIA staffing difficulties and any other observations in 
this regard that you believe would be helpful. 
 
   In closing, I want to reemphasize the importance of our 
cooperative efforts in this area.  The American public's 
understanding of the workings of its government is a cornerstone of 
our democracy.  The Department of Justice stands prepared to assist 
all federal agencies as we make government throughout the executive 
branch more open, more responsive, and more accountable. 
 
   /s/ Janet Reno

<p>
INTRODUCTION</b><p> </center>
    This action challenges the constitutionality of Public Law No.
104-130, 110 Stat. 1200 (1996)  (the
"Line Item Veto Act" or "Act"), which became effective on January
1, 1997.  Under Article I of the
Constitution, in order for any provision of federal law to be
enacted, amended, or repealed, a bill must
pass both Houses of Congress and be presented to the President, who
then has three choices: he may
approve the bill and sign it in whole, veto it in whole, or do
nothing (in which case it becomes law
without his signature "unless the Congress by their Adjournment
prevent its Return").  U.S. Const.
Art. I, sec. 7, cl. 2. <b> </b>Under the Line Item Veto Act,
however, the President may sign a bill but then,
at any time within the next five days, "cancel" any dollar amount
of appropriation, any new item of
direct spending, or certain tax benefits from the bill, simply by
sending Congress a cancellation
message.  Unless the cancellation is overridden by Congress (which
effectively requires a 2/3 vote of
each House), the canceled item has no legal force or effect, just
as if it had never been passed or
Congress had passed another law repealing it.<p>

     Congress knew there were constitutional doubts about this
major change in the process for making
law and wanted them to be resolved swiftly.  Section 3(a) of the
Act, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 692, under which
this case is brought, provides that any Member of Congress may
bring an action in this Court for a
declaratory judgment of unconstitutionality.<i><b>  (See Footnote
1)  </b></i>Section 692(b) provides for direct
review of this Court's decision by the Supreme Court and enjoins
both courts to expedite the disposition of the case "to the
greatest possible extent."  The case presents purely legal issues
and can
therefore be decided by summary judgment.  <i>See</i> <i>Synar v.
United States</i>, 626 F. Supp. 1374, 1379,
1404 (D.D.C.) (three-judge court) (per curiam), <i>aff'd</i>, 478
U.S. 714 (1986).<p>

<b><center>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</b><p>

</center>
<b><center>I.  THE COMPLAINT</b></center>
<p>

     The complaint was filed on January 2, 1997.  Plaintiffs are
three incumbent United States
Senators, one former Senator whose most recent term expired on
January 3, 1997, and two
incumbent Members of the House of Representatives.  <i><b>(See
Footnote 2)</b></i>  Defendants are Franklin
D. Raines, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget
("OMB"), and Robert E. Rubin,
the Secretary of the Treasury, each of whom is sued in his official
capacity.  Defendants will have
responsibility for executing presidential cancellations of spending
and tax authority.<p>

     The complaint alleges that the Act directly affects the voting
rights and other constitutional
prerogatives of the plaintiffs as Members of Congress.  Before the
Act, a bill could become part
of federal law only in the exact form in which it was passed by
both Houses of Congress.  Under
the Act, for the next eight years, a large number of bills (every
bill containing vetoable spending
or tax items) are instead subject to unilateral revision by the
President the instant they are signed
(and up to five days thereafter).  As a result, a Member's vote for
any such bill becomes a vote for
a menu of items from which the President may keep some and reject
others.  A Member loses the
assurance that the operative law will contain items that may have
been critical to his or her vote in
favor of passage.  And whenever a Member is considering whether to
vote in accordance with the
President's wishes on <i>other</i> legislation or on other matters
(such as appointments) coming before
Congress, or is considering oversight or criticism of the
Administration, he or she must take into
account the power of the President to item-veto particular
appropriation and spending items
important to that Member.  The Act thus dramatically shifts the
overall balance of lawmaking
power away from the Congress and toward the President.<p>

     The complaint alleges that the Act violates the carefully
considered procedure for making
federal law set forth in Article I of the Constitution.  Article I
requires that a bill must be passed in
whole, in exactly the same form, by both Houses of Congress and
presented to the President.<b> 
<i>(See Footnote 3)</i></b>  At that point, Article I gives the
President only three choices: "[1] If he
approves [the bill] he shall sign it, but [2] if not he shall
return it, with his Objections to [the
originating] House [of Congress]" or [3] he may do nothing, in
which case, after ten days, "the
Same shall be a Law ... unless the Congress by their Adjournment
prevent its Return."  U.S.
Const. Art. I, sec. 7, cl. 2.  It has been understood since
President Washington's first term that,
under each of these options, the President, like each House of
Congress, does not have the power
to revise bills unilaterally.  The complaint alleges that the Act
contravenes this constitutional
procedure in two related ways:<p>

     First, the Act violates the requirement that the President
either "approve" and sign a bill in
whole, or "not [approve]" and return the bill in whole.  It allows
the President, instead, to sign a
bill into law and then immediately "cancel" the portions he
disapproves.  The Act calls itself the
"Line Item Veto Act" and its stated purpose is "to give the
President line item veto authority,"
H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-491, at 1, 14 (1996), that is, authority to
revise a bill in conjunction
with signing it into law.  This is a power that 43 state governors
have in one form or another, but
in every such case the authority to veto items is contained in the
state constitution.  <i><b>(See Footnote
4)</i>  </b>Article I, by contrast, does not give the President
that option, and the Act unconstitutionally
circumvents Article I by allowing the President to veto ("cancel")
items immediately after signing
a bill.<p>

     Second, the Act violates the requirement that measures
repealing provisions of federal law
must be passed by both Houses of Congress and presented to the
President.  The Act gives the
President, using his unilateral cancellation authority, the power
to repeal provisions of federal law. 
Congress may not abdicate to the President its authority to
legislate repeals.  Moreover, the
authority granted to the President is unbounded by any meaningful
legislative standards and
extends to cancellation of items defined by unenacted tables,
charts, and explanatory text in
congressional reports accompanying future legislation.<p>

<p>

<b><center>II.  THE STATUTE</b></center>
<p>

     The Act was the culmination of a long examination of ways and
means to give the President
the power to accept some portions of budget authority, spending,
and tax bills while rejecting
other portions.  Part A, below, places the Act in context by
briefly describing the choices the
104th Congress debated. Part B then describes the pertinent
portions of the Act in greater detail.<p>

<b>A.     Summary of the Choices Considered in the 104th Congress.
</b><p>

                   <i>Constitutional amendment</i>.  In the 104th
Congress, constitutional amendments to
empower the President to veto portions of bills were introduced in
both Houses.  <i><b>(See Footnote
5)</b></i>  A hearing was held in the Senate,  <i><b>(See Footnote
6)</b></i> but no constitutional amendment was
voted on in committee or on the floor of either House.  <p>

     <i>Legislative approaches</i>.  The 104th Congress also
considered the three legislative approaches
described below.  The first, which raised no constitutional
problems, would have relied on
changing the procedures by which Congress itself conducts its
legislative business.  The second
relied on a device that appeared both highly impractical and
constitutionally suspect.  Both were
rejected, and Congress therefore adopted the third, the item veto
approach embodied in the Act.<p>

     1.     "<i>Expedited Rescission</i>."  One form of proposal,
exemplified by S. 14 of the 104th
Congress, would simply have assured prompt congressional
consideration of any presidential
recommendation that spending or tax items be rescinded (repealed)
as wasteful or unjustified.  S.
Rep. No. 104-10, at 1 (1995).  The Impoundment Control Act of 1974,
2 U.S.C. Sec. 688,
already provides for congressional consideration of presidential
rescission recommendations, but
it does not assure that Congress will bring them to a vote.  S. 14
would, in its sponsors' words,
have "guarantee[d] the President a vote on his rescission proposals
while maintaining the delicate
balance of power between the two branches on spending authority." 
S. Rep. No. 104-9, at 15
(1995) (additional views of Senator Domenici).  Both Houses voted
down "expedited rescission"
proposals on several occasions.  L.S. 5, 14.<p>

     2.     "<i>Separate Enrollment</i>."  A second approach relied
on treating each item as a separate
"bill," which the President could sign or veto as he chose, with
any veto subject to a 2/3 override. 
The separate enrollment approach was offered by the Senate
leadership as a way of giving the
President the power to approve and sign some items and veto others
without violating the
constitutional requirement that he approve or return a bill <i>in
toto</i>.  L.S. 12-14.  But such separate
handling of each of hundreds of items posed practical difficulties
and was regarded by some
Members as raising constitutional difficulties as well.  <i>See</i>
L.S. 18; 141 Cong. Rec. S4217,
S4224-35, S4244 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 1995).  Although S. 4, a
separate enrollment measure,
eventually passed the Senate, it met opposition in the House (L.S.
18), and it ultimately was
rejected in conference.<p>

     3.     <i>The Line Item Veto Act</i>.  The approach taken in
the Act, referred to in congressional
debates as "enhanced rescission," grants the President a new
authority to "cancel" provisions of a
bill the instant after he has signed the bill and for only five
days thereafter.  The procedure
"expand[s] the President's power to reduce discretionary spending
by giving him the authority to
cancel budget authority without any other action required by
Congress."  S. Rep. No. 104-9, at 1
(1995).  Presidential cancellations become law and remain in effect
unless the Congress musters
"a two-thirds vote in each House to override [a presidential] veto"
of any bill that disapproves the
President's cancellations.  H.R. Rep. No. 104-11, pt. 2, at 8
(1995).<p>

     <b>B.</b>     <b>Summary of the Act.</b><p>

<p>

     The full title of the Act is "An Act to give the President
line item veto authority with respect to
appropriations, new direct spending, and limited tax benefits." 
H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-491, at
14 (1996).  The Act, which was signed into law on April 9, 1996,
became effective on January 1,
1997, and remains effective until January 1, 2005.  Section 691
note.  The Act provides, in
pertinent part, as follows:<p>

     <i>The Item Veto Power</i>.  Section 691(a), under the caption
"Line item veto authority," provides
that, with respect to any bill that "has been signed into law," the
President may <p>

"cancel in whole":<p>

     (1) any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority [i.e.,
any appropriation]; (2) any item
of new direct spending; or (3) any limited tax benefit.<p>

The Act does not provide any item veto power for bills that are
passed over the President's veto
or become law without his signature, since they would not be
"signed into law." <p>

     <i>Definition of "cancel"</i>.  Section 691e(4) defines
"cancel" or "cancellation" to mean, with
respect to any amount of budgetary authority, "to rescind."  With
respect to any item of new
direct spending or limited tax benefit, the terms mean "to prevent
such [item or benefit] from
having legal force or effect."  <i>Id.</i>  The Conference Report
accompanying the Act, H.R. Conf. Rep.
No. 104-491, at 20 (1996), explains that cancellation "terminate[s]
the obligation of the Federal
Government to spend certain sums of money through a specific
appropriation or mandatory
payment."  For taxes, cancellation would permit "collect[ion of]
tax that would otherwise not be
collected or den[ial of] the credit that would otherwise be
provided."  <i>Id.</i> at 29.<p>

     <i>Determinations required</i>.  Section 691(a)(A) provides
that the President may cancel any item
so long as he "determines that such cancellation will (i) reduce
the Federal budget deficit; (ii) not
impair any essential Government functions; and (iii) not harm the
national interest . . . ."  No more
specific or substantive determination is required.<p>

     <i>When cancellation may be effected</i>.  Under Section
691(a), the President may cancel an item
as soon as it "has been signed into law pursuant to Article I,
section 7 of the Constitution."  Since
a bill becomes law immediately upon the President's signing it, he
may exercise the cancellation
power before the ink is dry.  The President has the cancellation
power for "five calendar days
(excluding Sundays) after the enactment."  Section 691(a)(B);
<i>see also</i> Section 691a(c)(1).  As
the Conference Report explains, Congress intended "that the
President's cancellations be made as
soon as possible," but that a "maximum" of five days is allowed "to
ensure that all supporting
material required for inclusion in the special [cancellation]
message can be provided by the
Administration."  H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-491, at 22 (1996). <p>

     <i>How cancellation is effected</i>.  The President cancels an
item by "notify[ing] the Congress of
such cancellation by transmitting a special message."  Section
691(a)(B).  The President may send
only one special message covering each bill, and it must specify
the amounts, items, and/or
benefits to be canceled; recite the three required presidential
determinations; set forth the
President's reasons for the cancellation; and describe the fiscal
and programmatic effects of the
cancellation.  Sections 691a(a) and (b).  The cancellation takes
effect upon receipt of the special
message by both Houses.  Section 691b(a).<p>

     <i>Definitions of appropriated "amounts," direct spending
"items," and "limited tax benefits."</i> 
The Act defines and describes the three categories of cancelable
(vetoable) provisions as follows:<p>

          <i>Dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority</i>. 
Section 691e(7) defines "dollar
amounts of discretionary budget authority," to include any dollar
amount set forth in an
appropriation law.  Since federal appropriations laws generally do
not specify appropriations in
detail, however, the Act further provides that the term "amount"
also includes any amount
"represented separately in any table, chart, or explanatory text
included in the statement of
managers or the governing committee report accompanying [an
appropriations] law."  Section
691e(7)(ii).  The Act thus defines the President's cancellation
authority partly by reference to the
legislative histories of future statutes. <b> </b>The Conference
Report states (at 32) that Congress did
this "as a means of allowing the President increased discretion." 
As the House Report on H.R. 2
recognized, the President's authority "differs fundamentally from
the kind of item veto granted to
governors" whose appropriations bills are highly itemized, so that
the President now has "greater
power and discretion than he would have with item veto authority"
like that in the states.  L.S. 3-4.<p>

     <i>     Items of direct spending</i>.  "Direct spending" is
defined as "(A) budget authority provided
by law (other than an appropriation law); (B) entitlement
authority; and (C) the food stamp
program."  Section 691e(5).  Thus, in general, direct spending
includes "entitlement" payments to
individuals, such as Medicare and Medicaid payments, <i>see</i>
Moynihan Decl. Par. 5, as well as
payments to state and local governments, <i>see</i> H.R. Conf. Rep.
No. 104-491, at 36 (1996); 2
U.S.C. Secs. 622(9) &amp; 651(c)(2)(C).  "Item of new direct
spending" means any provision that is
estimated to result in an increase in direct spending over the
baseline established by OMB under
the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. 
Section 691e(8).<p>

     <i>     Limited tax benefits</i>. "Limited tax benefit" is
defined to include any "revenue-losing
provision" that provides "a Federal tax deduction, credit,
exclusion, or preference to 100 or fewer
beneficiaries under [the Internal Revenue Code of 1986] in any
fiscal year," or any federal tax
provision that "provides temporary or permanent transitional relief
for 10 or fewer beneficiaries"
from a change in the Internal Revenue Code.  Section 691e(9).<p>

     <i>Additional effects of cancellation</i>.  The Act contains
a "deficit reduction, or 'lockbox,'
procedure," H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-491, at 23 (1996), so that
"savings" cannot be used for a
subsequent appropriation, direct spending, or tax relief measure. 
Section 691c; <i>see also</i> L.S. 14-15.<p>

     <i>Disapproval Bills</i>.  Once the President has transmitted
a cancellation message to Congress, the
canceled item is legally dead and may be resurrected only by
passage of new legislation.  The Act
provides for expedited consideration of such new laws, which it
labels "disapproval bills." 
Section 691d.  In general, those procedures are available for only
30 days after Congress receives
a cancellation message.  Section 691d(b)(1).  Like other statutes,
a disapproval bill must pass both
Houses of Congress and be presented to the President.  <i>See</i>
U.S. Const. Art. I, sec. 7, cl. 2.  If the
President vetoes the disapproval bill (as presumably he would,
since it reenacts provisions he has
just item-vetoed under the Act), Congress may override his veto in
the usual manner by a 2/3 vote
of each House. <p>

     <i>Judicial Review</i>.  The Act authorizes Members of
Congress to challenge the Act's
constitutionality in this Court.  Section 692(a).  Orders of this
Court may be appealed directly to
the Supreme Court, but the appellant is required to act
swiftly.<i><b>  (See Footnote 7)</b></i>  The Act
provides in strong language for expediting the proceedings: "It
shall be the duty of the District
Court for the District of Columbia and the Supreme Court of the
United States to advance on the
docket and to expedite to the greatest possible extent the
disposition of any matter brought under
subsection (a) of this section."  Section 692(c).<p>

     <i>No severability clause</i>.  The Act does not contain a
severability clause.  The bill that passed
the Senate had "a severability clause stating that if any one
provision of the Act is found to be
unconstitutional, the remainder of the Act will be held harmless,"
but it was removed in
conference.  H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-491, at 17 (1996).<p>

<p>

<center><b>ARGUMENT</b></center>
<p>

<b>I.     THE MOTION TO DISMISS SHOULD BE DENIED</b><p>

     Congressional proponents of the Act recognized that it would
be born under a constitutional
"cloud."  <i>See</i> p. 19 &amp; n. 12, <i>infra</i>.  Accordingly,
Congress included a judicial review provision
specifically authorizing "[a]ny Member of Congress" to bring this
lawsuit and commanding that its
disposition be expedited "to the greatest possible extent." 
Sections 692(a)(1) and (c).  Congress
thus expressed in the strongest possible terms its own view that
Members have standing and that
the courts should resolve the constitutional issues swiftly.  <p>

     In seeking dismissal, defendants are, necessarily, arguing
that this judicial review provision is
itself inconsistent with Article III of the Constitution.  In
essence, their argument, under both
"Standing" and "Ripeness" headings, is that there is only an
abstract question, and no concrete
"case or controversy," until the President actually exercises the
veto power.  Our answer, in
essence, is that the <i>existence</i> of the veto power injures the
plaintiffs (and the public interest) <i>now</i>,
by invading Members' rights and powers in the currently ongoing
process of formulating and
passing legislation, regardless of when or why the President first
actually vetoes an item.<p>

<p>

<b>A.     The Plaintiffs Have Standing.</b><p>

     <i>"Prudential" Standing Is Not at Issue</i>.  Section
692(a)(1) of the Act, provides that "Any
Member of Congress ... may bring an action" in this Court for a
declaratory judgment that the Act
is unconstitutional.  This provision eliminates any
<i>non</i>-constitutional issue as to standing.  <i>See</i>
<i>Fair Employment Council of Greater Washington, Inc. v. BMC Mktg.
Corp.</i>, 28 F.3d 1268, 1278
(D.C. Cir. 1994); <i>Synar v. United States</i>, 626 F. Supp. 1374,
1380 n.3 (D.D.C.) (three-judge
court) (per curiam) (in light of judicial review provision nearly
identical to the present Act, "[w]e
disregard . . . prudential limitations because we think it clear
that Congress has, by enacting the
judicial review provisions contained in Sec. 274, expanded standing
to the full extent permitted by
Article III"), <i>aff'd</i>, 478 U.S. 714 (1986).  <i><b>(See
Footnote 8)</b></i> <p>

     <i>Members Have Article III Standing To Challenge Incursions
on Their Voting Power</i>. Most of
the nearly 18 pages that defendants label their argument on
"standing" is in fact a discussion of
whether this case is <i>ripe</i> before the item-veto power has
been exercised.  We respond to that
discussion at pp. 18-24, <i>infra</i>.  The evident reason why
defendants leap quickly past the standing
issue is that D.C. Circuit precedents leave no doubt whatever that
Members of Congress have
Article III standing in this case.<p>

     As defendants are forced to acknowledge (Def. Mem. 12-13), the
court of appeals has
repeatedly ruled that Members have standing to challenge measures
that affect their voting power
or other constitutional prerogatives as lawmakers.  <i>See,
e.g.</i>, <i>Michel v. Anderson</i>, 14 F.3d 623,
625-26 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (standing to challenge House Rule
permitting delegates to vote in
Committee of the Whole because of its alleged dilutive effect);
<i>Moore v. U.S. House of
Representatives</i>, 733 F.2d 946, 950-53 (D.C. Cir. 1984),
<i>cert. denied</i>, 469 U.S. 1106 (1985)
(standing to assert violation of constitutional requirement that
revenue raising bills originate in the
House); <i>Vander Jagt v. O'Neill</i>, 699 F.2d 1166, 1168-71 (D.C.
Cir.), <i>cert. denied</i>, 464 U.S. 823
(1983) (standing to challenge leadership's committee seating
decisions); <i>Kennedy v. Sampson</i>, 511
F.2d 430, 433-36 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (standing to challenge "pocket
veto" as nullification of
Senator's vote).  Defendants cite two concurring opinions that
support their position, <i>see</i> <i>Moore</i>,
733 F.2d at 959 (Scalia, J., concurring); <i>Vander Jagt</i>, 699
F.2d at 1179-82 (Bork, J., concurring),
but the court of appeals has squarely rejected the views expressed
there.  <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Vander Jagt</i>,
699 F.2d at 1168-69.<p>

     In particular, the D.C. Circuit precedents recognize that,
when Member plaintiffs challenge a
measure that affects their voting power and the legal consequences
of their votes, they are not
asserting merely a generalized interest in the proper functioning
of the Government.  They are
alleging an injury to themselves in their official capacities,
because their power to vote on
legislation is specifically conferred on them by the Constitution. 
Judge Wilkey stressed this point
in <i>Moore</i>:<p>
<blockquote> It is important ... that the injury claimed here is to
the members' rights to participate and vote on legislation in a
manner defined by the Constitution.  Deprivation of a
constitutionally mandated process of enacting law may inflict a
more specific injury on a member of Congress than would be
presented by a generalized complaint that a legislator's
effectiveness is diminished by allegedly illegal activities taking
place outside the legislative forum.</blockquote>
<p>
733 F.2d at 951.  <i>See also</i> <i>Michel</i>,14 F.3d at 630
(noting that the Constitution specifically gives
Members the right "to vote in the full House and to be
recorded").<p>

     Defendants are of course entitled to make their standing
argument here to preserve it for the
Supreme Court, but the precedents suggest, and there is no contrary
authority, that this Court is
obligated to follow D.C. Circuit precedent on this issue in the
absence of a Supreme Court ruling. 
<i>See</i> <i>Synar</i>, 626 F. Supp. at 1381 &amp; n.7 (adhering
to D.C. Circuit precedent on standing in case
subject to Supreme Court review); <i>see also</i> <i>Turner Broad.
Sys., Inc. v. FCC</i>, 819 F. Supp. 32, 41
(D.D.C. 1993) (three-judge court) (addressing D.C. Circuit
precedent notwithstanding mandatory
Supreme Court review), <i>remanded</i>, 512 U.S. 622 (1994);
<i>ACLU v. Reno</i>, 929 F. Supp. 824 (E.D.
Pa.) (three-judge court) (similar), <i>probable jurisdiction
noted</i>, 117 S. Ct. 554 (1996). <p>

     The three-judge court's decision in <i>Synar</i> squarely
upheld the Article III standing of Members
of Congress in a case indistinguishable on the standing issue from
the present case. In <i>Synar</i>, the
plaintiff Members challenged a statute (the Gramm Rudman Hollings
Act) that created a
mechanism for reducing congressionally authorized spending.  The
court said:<p>
<blockquote> [T]he law of this Circuit . . . recognizes a personal
interest by Members of Congress in the exercise of their
governmental powers . . . . </blockquote><br>

<blockquote> The congressional plaintiffs claim that they are and
will continue to be injured by the operation of the automatic
deficit reduction process because it interferes with their
"constitutional duties to enact laws regarding federal spending"
and infringes upon their lawmaking powers under Article I, section
7. . . .  This claim of injury is "specific" and "discernible"; and
it arises out of an interest "identified by the Constitution," that
is, a congressional interest in having all laws made in the manner
prescribed . . . in Article I, section 7. </blockquote><br>
626 F. Supp. at 1381-82.<p>

     Here, as in <i>Moore</i> and other cases cited above, Members
are complaining about
a concrete effect on the voting power the Constitution gives them
-- indeed, here,
the effect of the Act on the very meaning of the votes they cast. 
Their Declarations
detail three injuries caused by the operation of the Act.<p>

     First, by conferring power on the President to item-veto
appropriations, the Act
changes the legal effect of Members' votes on appropriations bills. 
Until now, when
a Member voted for an appropriations bill containing more than one
item (as they
virtually all do), he knew that his vote could be counted only for
that bill, with
exactly those items and only those items, and that any variation
would require
another vote.  Under the Act, the Member's same vote on the same
bill has a
dramatically different effect: it becomes a vote to give the
President a <i>menu</i> of items
that <i>he</i> may choose from, without going back to Congress for
another vote before
his choice has legal effect.  Thus, a vote for the "A-B-C" bill is
also, at the same
time, a vote authorizing the President to turn it into an "A-B"
bill, an "A-C" bill, or
a "B-C" bill, etc.  Byrd Decl. Pars. 18-19.<p>

     This effect of the Act is a concrete present effect that does
not depend on when
or why the President first vetoes an item.  The Act forces Members,
whenever they
pass an appropriation bill, to authorize the President to select
from "menus."  It
thus injures the plaintiffs whenever such a bill comes up for a
vote, even if, in a
particular instance, the President later decides to approve
everything on a particular
"menu."  Byrd Decl. Pars. 18-19; Levin Decl. Par. 6B.<p>

     Second, the Act, again merely by being in force, affects
Members' powers in the
formulation of legislation, because they must take the item-veto
<i>power</i> into account
at that time, regardless of when or how it is later used. 
<i><b>(See Footnote 9)</b></i>  Prior to
the Act, Members negotiating a compromise within the House or
Senate on a
spending or tax bill had assurance that the bill could take
operative effect only in the
form agreed to within that body, and that items successfully
negotiated for would
be preserved.  The Act, by giving the President power to upset
legislative compromises, forces Members to deal with the President
during the House process and
the Senate process if they want to be confident that an item will
survive.  Before the
Act, a Member voting on final passage of a bill might accept
provisions he
disagreed with in order to secure passage of provisions he
supported.  <i>See</i> Byrd
Decl. Par. 18; Levin Decl. Par. 6; Waxman Decl. Par. 7.  The Act,
however,
empowers the President to undo any such compromise.   <i>See</i>
Byrd Decl. Pars. 20-21; Hatfield Decl. Par.4; Levin Decl. Par. 4,
6; Waxman Decl. Par. 7; Skaggs Decl.
Par. 6.<p>

     Again, this is a concrete present effect.  A Member who
negotiates and votes on
an appropriations bill containing items he believes important to
his constituency
must anticipate the President's unilateral power effectively to
revise the bill to
eliminate those items.  And a Member now considering her vote on
any other
matter in which the President has an interest (<i>e.g.</i>, other
legislation, or a
confirmation of a presidential appointment) must <i>now</i> weigh
the President's power
to veto an appropriation item of interest to that Member or his or
her constituents.
Levin Decl. Par. 6A; Skaggs Decl. Par. 3.<p>

     Third, when the President does cancel an item, he is both
nullifying Members'
votes for that item and repealing a duly enacted law, a power the
Constitution gives
only to Congress.  <p>

     The D.C. Circuit's decision in <i>National Treasury Employees
Union v. United
States</i>, 101 F.3d 1423 (D.C. Cir. 1996), is not to the contrary. 
NTEU did not have
standing because the future impact of the Act on NTEU was
inherently speculative:
"[NTEU's] mission is to obtain improved worker conditions -- a
mission not
necessarily inconsistent with the Line Item Veto Act."  <i>Id.</i>
at 1430.  NTEU did not
and could not demonstrate any necessary effect of the Act on its
mission, because
except for changing its lobbying strategy, the Act would not affect
NTEU unless
there was an actual prospect of having an item of NTEU concern
vetoed.  The
Members, by contrast, have documented the shift in the legal effect
of votes they
are certain to cast and in their power in formulating federal
legislation.<p>

<p>

<b>B.  This Case is Ripe.</b><p>

     <i>"Prudential" Ripeness Is Not an Issue</i>. Congress
instructed this Court and the
Supreme Court to resolve the Act's constitutionality expeditiously. 
In addition to
dispensing with intermediate appellate review, the Act directs this
Court and the
Supreme Court "to advance [this case] on the docket and . . .
expedite [its
disposition] to the greatest possible extent."  Section 692(c). 
<p>

<p>

     The express purpose of the expedition requirement was to
remove (or confirm)
the constitutional "cloud" as swiftly as possible.  For example,
Senator Exon, a
proponent of the Act, noted that it would engender immediate
constitutional
questions, affecting spending and tax measures, that should be
promptly resolved: <p>
<blockquote> [W]e do not want a constitutional cloud hanging over
what I think we will
eventually pass....  We do not want that cloud hanging over
forever.  The pending
amendment [the provision for expedited judicial review] simply
allows a speedy
resolution of this constitutional issue.  It does not allow a legal
challenge to hang
over all the bills for years upon years.</blockquote><p>
141 Cong. Rec. S4244 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 1995).  <i><b>(See
Footnote 10)</b></i>  Congress's
commands clearly eliminate all merely "prudential" questions of
ripeness.<p>

     <i>There Is No Article III Ripeness Problem</i>.  Ripeness
also has a constitutional
dimension, but the only constitutional issue is whether the dispute
is so unformed
that there is not a "case or controversy."  <i>See</i> <i>Duke
Power Co. v. Carolina Envtl.
Study Group Inc.</i>, 438 U.S. 59, 81 (1978); <i>Regional Rail
Reorganization Act
Cases</i>, 419 U.S. 102, 138 (1974).  The purpose of the doctrine
is to assure that
federal courts do not take up "abstract disagreements" that might
never become
concrete disputes.  <i>See</i> <i>Thomas v. Union Carbide Agric.
Prods. Co.</i>, 473 U.S. 568,
580-81 (1985).<p>

     Here, there is certainly a concrete controversy, and the
proper time to resolve it
is now:  <i><b>(See Footnote 11)</b></i> (i) Plaintiffs are
suffering present injury, regardless of
when the President first exercises the item veto power.  (ii) The
issues are purely
legal and will not be clarified by further factual development:
defendants assert that
an actual veto will give the court an "indispensable factual
context," Def. Mem. 27,
but they do not explain how the President's selection of a
particular item to veto
will in any way illuminate the constitutional issues.  (iii)
Perhaps most important,
failure to resolve the constitutional issue before the President
vetoes an item will
leave that item -- and other parts of any appropriation or other
bill to which it was
attached -- under the cloud created by the Act.<p>

     (i)      <i>Plaintiffs' Injuries Include Present and Imminent
Injuries</i>.  Defendants'
primary contention is that plaintiffs are seeking an advisory
opinion because they
will not have suffered injury until the President actually
exercises the veto and
Congress fails to override it.  But in fact, important parts of
plaintiffs' injury could
hardly be more "certainly impending," <i>Whitmore v. Arkansas</i>,
495 U.S. 149, 158
(1990), and "imminent," <i>Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat'l
Union</i>, 442 U.S.
289, 298 (1979); <i>see</i> <i>Thomas</i>, 473 U.S. at 579-82;
<i>Synar</i>, 626 F. Supp. at 1380.<p>

     The President already has his blue pencil.  And appropriations
bills containing
separately vetoable items are certain to be presented for
congressional and
presidential consideration very soon: The President will present
his budget on
February 6, 1997, triggering steps designed to lead to enactment of
appropriations
by October 1, 1997 when the new fiscal year begins.  <i><b>(See
Footnote 12)</b></i>  The
process of formulating appropriations bills will thus be ongoing by
the time the
Court hears argument in this case, and the process of voting on
such bills is clearly
"imminent."  Other bills and presidential appointments are of
course also under
active consideration.<p>

     As explained above, the Act injures the plaintiffs in these
current and imminent
processes.  It forces them to vote to authorize the President to
choose from
appropriations "menus," rather than enact whole laws that he must
sign or veto in
the whole form they are presented to him.  It also gives the
President a powerful
new tool with which to seek Members' votes on other matters. 
<b><i>(See Footnote 13) </i></b>
Neither of these injuries depends on when or why the President
first actually
exercises his new power.  As former Senator Hatfield states in his
Declaration,
based on his 25 years of negotiating and shepherding appropriations
bills to
passage, the Act has "an immediate and pervasive impact on the
formulation of
legislation."  Hatfield Decl. Par. 4.<b><p>

</b>     Of course, even if the Court accepted defendants' argument
that only the
exercise of a veto would actually injure the plaintiffs, plaintiffs
need not wait until
actual exercise to invoke this Court's jurisdiction.  <i>See</i>
<i>Abbott Labs. v. Gardner</i>,
387 U.S. 136, 140 (1967); <i>see also</i> <i>Buckley v. Valeo</i>,
424 U.S. 1, 117 (1976)
(challenge, under similar expedited review provision, to method of
appointing FEC
members was ripe in anticipation of "impending future rulings and
determinations"). 
It is entirely appropriate for this Court to assume that the
President has every
intention of exercising the item veto power, which he strongly
supported
throughout the events leading to passage of the Act.<b>  <i>(See
Footnote 14)</i><p>

</b>     (ii)     <i>The Constitutional Issue Is Fully Formed</i>. 
Defendants argue that the
Court should wait until there is an exercise of the veto in order
to have a "factual
context within which to evaluate plaintiffs' constitutional
claims."  Def. Mem. 27. 
But at best fitness for review is a "prudential" consideration. 
<i>Thomas</i>, 473 U.S. at
581; <i>Babbitt</i>, 442 U.S. at 300-01; <i>Thorsted v.
Gregoire</i>, 841 F. Supp. 1068, 1074
(W.D. Wash. 1994), <i>aff'd</i>, 75 F.3d 454 (9th Cir. 1996). 
Moreover, the President's
first item veto, which may be on an item trivial to most Members,
will not further
illuminate the constitutional issues.  If the President is given
the opportunity to
frame a "test case," he will of course be able to find an unneeded
museum or
hospital to veto,  <i><b>(See Footnote 15)</b></i> but his doing so
will not assist the Court in
deciding whether his vast new power complies with Article I.  <p>

     It is also no answer to say that Congress, as a whole, can
exempt particular bills,
pass a disapproval bill restoring a canceled item (presumably over
the President's
veto of the disapproval bill), or repeal the Act (again, presumably
over the
President's veto).  No individual Member can secure any of these
actions.  The Act's
effects on the legal meaning of an individual Member's vote when
she casts it, and
on the individual Member's rights and powers in the process of
formulating
legislation, are not eliminated by the mere possibility that
Congress as a whole may
later act to protect against the item veto; indeed, even if
Congress were, in a
particular instance, to adopt a disapproval bill and override the
President's veto of
that bill, this action would not eliminate the Act's effects on the
formulation of the
original measure.  Indeed, in <i>Michel</i>, 14 F.3d 623, the Court
found no justiciability
hurdle to its consideration of the constitutionality of a House
Rule that was
essentially nugatory in its effect.<p>

     (iii) <i>     The Public Interest Requires a Prompt Resolution
of the Constitutional
Issue</i>.  Congress had good reason for requiring expedition.  It
is not only the Act's
own constitutionality that is under a "cloud" but also the validity
of any exercise of
the item veto and therefore the validity and operative effect of
any vetoed items and
any other statutory provisions that are tied or related to them. 
Even if Congress
had not commanded expedition and the Court were free to take its
own account of
"prudential" considerations, prudence would clearly dictate
resolving the
constitutional issue in an orderly manner now, rather than
scrambling to do so only
after a cancellation is in effect and Congress has failed to
disapprove it.<p>

     The D.C. Circuit's decision that NTEU's challenge to the Act
was not
constitutionally ripe, 101 F.3d at 1430-31, is readily
distinguishable.  The court's
only explanation of this ruling was that "the veto power is not
only unexercised, but
is as yet unavailable" (because the Act had not yet become
effective).  <i>Id.</i> at 1431. 
That, of course, has changed.  Moreover, although the court did not
make this
point in discussing constitutional ripeness, NTEU could claim at
most that its
members might later be affected if a possible appropriation bill
benefiting them were
subject to the item veto.  Members of Congress, by contrast, are
affected in their
official capacities immediately and continuously, including any
time <i>any</i> appropriation bill, or any other bill containing
separately vetoable items is brought to a vote. 
There is no doubt that this will occur in the 1997 session of
Congress.<p>

<b>     <p>

C.  The Doctrine of Remedial Discretion Has No Role To Play in this
Case.<p>

</b>     Defendants also ask the Court to dismiss this case under
the D.C. Circuit's
"remedial discretion" doctrine.  Def. Mem. 30-35.  They make two
arguments, both
without merit.  <p>

     First, they say this Court should abstain from deciding the
constitutional issue
because plaintiffs have a remedy in the form of repeal of the law
by their own
branch.  But "remedial discretion" is, as its name implies, a
prudential and not a
constitutional doctrine.  <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Michel</i>, 14 F.3d
at 628; <i>Synar</i>, 626 F. Supp. at
1382.  As such, whatever its validity or application in other
circumstances, it clearly
must yield to the statutory command that "Any Member of Congress .
. . may bring
an action . . . for declaratory judgment . . . that [the Act]
violates the Constitution." 
Section 692(a).<p>

     Again, the three-judge court's decision in <i>Synar</i> is
squarely on point.  Under
judicial review provisions nearly identical to those in the Line
Item Veto Act, the
court found "no occasion to consider exercising the equitable
discretion held by this
Circuit's cases to justify denial of specific or declaratory relief
to Members of
Congress," because the specific statutory authorization of Member
suits "eliminat[ed] whatever equitable discretion might exist . .
. ." <i>Synar</i>, 626 F. Supp. at 1382.<p>

     Second, defendants argue that it would be inappropriate for
the Court to rule
that the Act is unconstitutional when Congress has consented to the
surrender of its
constitutional powers.  But separation-of-powers violations cannot
be ratified by
the consent of one branch.  "The Constitution's division of power
among the three
branches is violated where one branch invades the territory of
another, whether or
not the encroached upon branch approves the encroachment."  <i>New
York v. United
States</i>, 505 U.S. 144, 182 (1992); <i>see</i> <i>id.</i>. ("The
constitutional authority of
Congress cannot be expanded by the 'consent' of the governmental
unit whose
domain is thereby narrowed"); <i>Buckley</i>, 424 U.S. at 118-37
(infringement of
President's appointments power invalid despite President's
approval); <i>Immigration
and Naturalization Service v. Chadha</i>, 462 U.S. 919, 944-59
(1983).<p>

     In sum, Congress hoped this Court would decide this case on
its constitutional
merits and expressed that wish in the statute.  Defendants'
justiciability arguments
amount to a contention that the Act's judicial review provisions
are themselves
contrary to the Constitution.  But the Constitution does not bar
this Court from
doing as Congress instructed: proceeding to consider this case.<p>

<p>

<b><center>II.  THE ACT VIOLATES THE LAWMAKING REQUIREMENTS OF
ARTICLE I </b><p>

</center>
     Article I requires that any "Bill" making or changing federal
law be first passed
by both Houses of Congress and then presented to the President
<i>in toto</i>, either
approved or disapproved by the President <i>in toto</i>, and (if
disapproved) returned to
Congress <i>in toto</i>.  <i>See</i> U.S. Const. Art. I, sec. 7,
cl. 2 (the "Presentment Clause"). 
This "<i>in toto</i>" requirement is an intended and important
feature of Article I.  It
denies each participant in the lawmaking process -- House, Senate,
and President --
the power of unilateral revision of the others' work.  It thus
assures that each House
of Congress has approved and passed the whole of any bill that
becomes law, and it
limits the President's power in the lawmaking process.   <p>

     The purpose of the Act, as its name makes clear, was to
circumvent this
requirement and give the President the ability to veto parts of a
bill while signing
the remaining parts into law.  Congress understood, however, that
Article I does
not permit it to give the President straightforwardly the power to
sign and veto
portions of a bill simultaneously.  The drafters of the Act
therefore sought to
circumvent the <i>in toto</i> requirement by providing for an ever
so slight separation of
the President's actions and suggesting that the grant of power to
"cancel" is no
more than a routine delegation of authority not to spend
appropriated funds.<p>

     But the Act is too clever by half.  It violates both the
purpose and the letter of
Article I.  The "sign-and-then-cancel" procedure mocks the
requirement that the
President "approve" a whole bill before signing: now, he need only
"approve" the
law that results from his own handiwork.  The Act denies both
Houses of Congress
and their individual Members the assurance that a bill will have
operative effect only
in the form in which they passed it.  And the Act confers on the
President a five-day
power to repeal provisions of federal law unilaterally, without
either bicameral
passage or presentment.  In the guise of a delegation of authority,
the Act gives the
President the precise power the Framers intentionally denied him:
the unilateral
power to revise federal law.<p>

<p>

<b>A.  Article I Places Important Limitations on Each Participant
in the Federal
Lawmaking Process.</b><p>

     Article I sets forth a "single, finely wrought and
exhaustively considered
procedure," for the passage of legislation.  <i>Immigration and
Naturalization Service
v. Chadha</i>, 462 U.S. 919, 951 (1983).  This procedure requires
that any change in
federal statutory law must be approved, in whole, by each House of
Congress (the
requirement of "bicameral passage"), and either approved in whole
by the President
or enacted in whole over his veto or without his signature (the
requirement of
"presentment"). <p>

     <i>Bicameral Passage</i>.  The Constitution vests "all
legislative Powers herein
granted" in a Congress consisting of two Houses.  U.S. Const. Art.
I, sec. 1.  It
requires that, before any bill may become law, it "shall have
passed the House of
Representatives and the Senate."  <i>Id.</i> sec. 7, cl. 2.  Every
bill must pass both
Houses in its full final form: The Framers "provid[ed] that no law
could take effect
without the concurrence of the prescribed majority of the Members
of both
Houses." <i>Chadha</i>, 462 U.S. at 948; <i>see</i> <i>Field v.
Clark</i>, 143 U.S. 649, 669-70
(1892).  The Framers required bicameral passage quite deliberately,
both to assure
careful and prudent judgment in legislating, <i>see</i> The
Federalist Nos. 22, 51
(Hamilton); <i>Chadha</i>, 462 U.S. at 948-51 (<i>citing</i> 1
Farrand 254 (statement of James
Wilson)),<b> </b>and to protect the "Great Compromise" by requiring
that both the
Chamber representing the States (the Senate) and the Chamber
representing the
people (the House) pass every bill that becomes law, The Federalist
Nos. 51, 62, 63
(Madison); <i>see generally</i> <i>Chadha</i>, 462 U.S. at 948-51
(citing, <i>inter</i> <i>alia</i>, 1 Farrand
at 99-104).<p>

     <i>Presentment</i>.  The Constitution does not give the
President any "legislative
Powers" but only "a salutary check upon the legislative body."  The
Federalist No.
73 (Hamilton); <i>see</i> <i>Edwards v. United States</i>, 286 U.S.
482, 490-91 (1932).  Under
Article II, section 3, the President may "recommend" legislation
for
"Consideration" by Congress.  His "salutary check" begins only
after both Houses
have passed a bill and it is "presented" to him.  At that point,
unlike the House and
Senate, each of which has the absolute power to block passage of a
bill it disfavors,
the President has only a qualified blocking power, because his veto
may be
overridden.  And that blocking power can be exercised only as to a
whole bill, not
as to selected individual parts.<p>

     When a bill is presented to the President, the Presentment
Clause gives him only
three choices:<p>

<p>

<blockquote> [1] If he approve he shall sign it, but [2] if not he
shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it
shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on
their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. . . . [3] If any Bill
shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays
excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall
be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the
Congress by their Adjournment prevent its
Return....</blockquote><p>

U.S. Const. Art. I, sec. 7, cl. 2.  This language focuses
throughout on the <i>whole</i>
bill.  The President may "approve" and sign "it," in which case
"it" becomes law; or
he may "not [approve]" and return "it" "with his Objections" to the
House where it
originated (i.e., veto it); or he may do nothing, in which case
"the Same shall be a
Law" in ten days unless the pocket veto clause applies.  The plain
language of the
Constitution does not permit the President to approve and sign some
parts of a bill
and veto others.<p>

     The requirement that the President sign, veto, or leave
unsigned <i>the whole bill</i>
has been clear since President Washington's first term:  "From the
nature of the
Constitution, I must approve all the parts of a Bill, or reject it
in toto."  33 <i>Writings
of George Washington</i> 96<b> </b>(1940).  Eighteenth Century
explanations of the
Presentment Clause are consistent with Washington's view.  <i>See
generally</i> 12 Op.
Off. Legal Counsel 128 (1988) (Att. 3).  Later Presidents have
understood that they
could not approve or disapprove a Bill in part.<i><b>  (See
Footnote 16)</b></i>  To the best of
our knowledge, there was no serious suggestion, from the time of
the Framers until
recently,<b> </b>that the President could sign some parts of a bill
into law while rejecting
other parts.<i><b>  (See Footnote 17)</b></i><p>

     The "<i>in toto</i>" requirement is of fundamental importance
for two reasons.  First,
it protects the "bicameral" principle that every change in federal
law must be passed
in whole by both Houses.  Just as neither House can unilaterally
revise the other's
work, <i>see</i> <i>Field</i>, 143 U.S. at 669-70, the President
cannot unilaterally revise a bill
after both Houses have approved it, because the resulting federal
law would then
not be the work of the two Houses.  Indeed, it would be especially
anomalous if the
President -- the only one of the three participants whose approval
is <i>not</i> always
required for a bill to become law -- had the power to revise the
work of the other
two participants.  <i><b>(See Footnote 18)</b></i> <p>

     Second, the "<i>in toto</i>" requirement limits the
President's power vis-a-vis each
Member of Congress in the lawmaking process.  It assures a Member
who votes for
a bill that, if the bill is enacted, those items that the Member
considers important
will be part of operative federal law.  It also ensures that a
Member out of favor
with the President, or not of his party, will not have his or her
especially preferred
items routinely item-vetoed.  And it prevents the President from
raising the
possibility of future vetoes of "items" sought by individual
Members as a way of
securing their support for <i>other</i> legislation, or their
favorable action on other
matters such as confirmation of appointments and ratification of
treaties, or in
regard to their criticism of an Administration.  As Congress
recognized (<i>see</i> L.S. 2,
11, 14, 25-26), the power to veto "items" is a much stronger weapon
than the
power to veto a whole bill, which the President often can do only
at considerable
cost. <p>

     If the President had a unilateral power of revision -- the
power to treat a bill
presented to him as a menu from which he may pick and choose
particular items --
the Framers' solicitude for collective legislative judgments would
be defeated.  The
President could negotiate with, and show favoritism toward, Members
individually,
depriving all the Members of each House of their constitutional
prerogative to
speak (through their legislative enactments) with one voice.<p>

     The constant process of bargaining and compromise between and
among
different interests is of course a central feature of our political
system, and it is
entirely appropriate for the participants in the process, including
the President, to
seek to advance the interests that they favor most.  But the
Framers carefully
designed the requirements of bicameral passage and presentment to
assure that the
bargaining among interests would have to occur among the Members of
the House
<i>and</i> in the Senate <i>and</i> in the course of gaining the
President's support, because the
concurrence of all three participants (or the override of the
President's veto) would
be required to enact a law.<p>

     Finally, the bicameral passage requirement and the <i>in
toto</i> requirement together
perform an even more fundamental task: to separate legislative and
executive
powers by denying the President the power to make the law.  The
President's power
under Article II, section 1 is the "executive Power."  The
Constitution commands
him to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed" (Art. II,
sec. 3), a
responsibility that, as Justice Jackson noted on an important
occasion, is wholly
inconsistent with the notion that he may revise the laws rather
than carry them out. 
<i>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer</i>, 343 U.S. 579, 587
(1952) ("[T]he
President's power to see that the laws are faithfully executed
refutes the idea that he
is to be a lawmaker."). <p>

     The separation of executive and legislative power is of course
among the most
basic principles of the constitutional structure.  In The
Federalist No. 47, Madison
quoted Montesquieu:<p>
<blockquote> There can be no liberty where the legislative and
executive powers are united in the same person, or body of
magistrates.</blockquote><p>
<p>

The tripartite structure is at "the heart of [the] Constitution,"
<i>Buckley</i>, 424 U.S. at
119, because "[t]he Framers recognized that, in the long term,
structural
protections against abuse of power were critical to preserving
liberty," <i>Bowsher v.
Synar</i>, 478 U.S. 714, 730 (1986).  <i><b>(See Footnote
19)</b></i>  <p>

     Hence laws are to be made in a process of debate and
compromise, well
understood by the Framers, <i>see, e.g.</i>, The Federalist No. 10
(Madison); <i>cf.</i> The
Federalist No. 85 (Hamilton), leading to a majority vote in each
House that a
particular set of items should be added to (or changed in) federal
law.  When
Congress has reached that collective judgment by passing a whole
bill, and the
President has approved the whole bill or his veto has been
overridden, the
President's most basic duty is to see that the resulting law is
"faithfully executed." 
A unilateral presidential power of revision, either at the signing
of a bill or
immediately afterwards, allows the President to change the law
rather than carry it
out.  Such a power deprives every Member of his or her right to
participate in the
process that results in the passage of whole bills vetoable only as
a whole. 
Moreover, as we show below, it confers on the President a lawmaking
power that
the Framers denied to the holder of the law-executing power.<p>

<b><p>

B.  The Act Contravenes the "In Toto" Requirement of Article I.<p>

     </b>Under the Act, when a bill containing vetoable items is
presented to the
President, he has exactly the power that the Framers deliberately
denied to him (and
to each House of Congress): the power to approve parts of a bill
and reject others. 
He is not required either to approve and sign the whole bill or
return the whole bill,
but he may instead approve part and return part, as he alone sees
fit.<p>

     Supporters of the Act generally conceded that a law giving the
President power
to strike out portions of a bill before signing it would be
unconstitutional.  L.S. 9;
Statement of Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney General, Hearings
Before the
Subcomm. on the Constitution, Federalism, and Property Rights of
the Senate
Judiciary Comm., 104th Cong., 1st Sess., at 1-2 (Jan. 24, 1995). 
However, they
believed they had satisfied the Constitutional requirements by the
device of having
the President sign the whole bill first and then cancel the parts
of which he
disapproves.  But sign-and-then-cancel is no different in effect
from, and no more
constitutional than,
strike-line-items-and-then-sign-the-rest-of-the-bill. <p>

     Article I does not say merely that the President must decide
whether to <i>sign</i> or
<i>return</i> the whole bill.  It imposes a much more important
responsibility, to decide
whether or not he "<i>approves</i>" the whole bill:<p>

<p>

<blockquote> If he <i>approves</i> he shall sign it, but if
<i>not</i> he shall return it, <i>with his Objections</i> to
that House in which it shall have originated, who shall <i>enter
the Objections</i> at large on their Journal, and proceed to
reconsider it.</blockquote><p>

U.S. Const. Art. I, sec. 7, cl. 2 (emphasis added).  The words of
the Constitution
require the President first to make a judgment about "it" (he
either "approves" or
"not"); his signature or return is merely the consequence of that
judgment about the
bill "<i>in toto</i>."  And if his judgment is "not," he is
required to state his objections so
that Congress can consider whether it wants to enact the same bill
over his veto or
modify it to meet his objections and present it to him again.  The
President need
not, of course, "like" or "dislike" all parts of a bill, but he
must decide whether,
taking "it" as a whole, he "approves" it or "not," and it can
become law with his
signature only if, taking it as a whole, he "approves" it.<p>

     The Act releases the President from having to make that
constitutionally
required judgment.  He physically signs the whole bill, but he need
not decide that
he "approves" it, because he can immediately "cancel" the parts he
disapproves. 
Under the Act, the President can comfortably sign a bill even if he
in fact
disapproves of most of its provisions and would otherwise veto it. 
The drafters of
the Act thus evaded the central purpose of the Presentment Clause:
to assure that
when a bill is passed with the President's signature, he has
concurred in the
judgment of the House and Senate that "it" -- the same bill they
passed -- warrants
his approval and should become law. <p>

     The explicit objective of the Act was to circumvent the
requirement that House,
Senate, and the President (if he signs) all concur in approving the
same bill.  The
Act, instead, deliberately gives the President precisely the power
of unilateral
revision -- the item veto power -- that President Washington knew
the Constitution
had rejected.  The Act bluntly calls itself the "Line Item Veto
Act," and its
legislative history is replete with evidence that the item veto
(subject, like any other
Presidential veto, to an override by two-thirds of each House) was
precisely what
they sought to accomplish.  Indeed, bills reported out in both
Houses used the
words "veto" and "repeal"<b> </b>(L.S. 1, 3, 11);  the Act as
adopted uses the word
"cancel," but the effect remained the same.<i><b>  (See Footnote
20)</b></i><p>

     To be sure, the Act requires the President to do the signing
first and the
canceling second.  But the President may sign a bill and then
(since the bill becomes
law in that instant) sign and immediately transmit a cancellation
message.  He may
sign both the bill and the cancellation message without rising from
his desk, without
speaking to anyone, literally in the same breath.  The Act's
sign-and-then-cancel
process is, in its effect, exactly the same as a "literal" line
item veto: it results in the
enactment into law of some of the provisions passed by Congress and
the veto of
others, exactly what the Presentment Clause was designed to
prohibit.  <i><b>(See
Footnote 21)</b></i>  <p>

     Under the Act, a whole bill becomes law for a <i>scintilla
juris</i> before being
unilaterally revised by the President.  But the Presentment Clause
is about
something more important than signing formalities. <b> </b>As the
Supreme Court said in
<i>Chadha</i>, 462 U.S. at 958, n.22, "The legislative steps
outlined in Art. I are not
empty formalities; they were designed to assure that both Houses of
Congress and
the President participate in the exercise of lawmaking authority." 
The Court added,
"[T]he purposes underlying the Presentment Clauses . . . and the
bicameral
requirement" must guide resolution of the question whether a given
procedure is
constitutional.  462 U.S. at 946.  And the central purpose of the
<i>in toto</i> requirement
of the Presentment Clause is to limit the President's role in the
enactment of
legislation by requiring him, like the Senate and House, to act on
a "Bill" in its
entirety.  The Act surely cannot defeat that purpose by simply
separating the
moments in which the President signs the papers on his desk.<p>

     In sum, the Constitution, as President Washington recognized,
denies the
President the power to revise a bill and have it become law without
House and
Senate passage of the revised version: if the President wants a
bill to be changed
before it becomes law, he must return "it," the whole bill, "with
his Objections" and
seek House and Senate passage of a revised measure.  If the
President had the right
of unilateral revision, his power in the lawmaking process would be
greatly
enhanced, and the powers of both Houses and all their individual
Members would
be correspondingly reduced.  But the Presentment Clause expressly
denies the
President that enhanced power in order to limit his lawmaking role. 
The device of
the Act -- sign the whole bill and then cancel part -- is an
unconstitutional attempt
to circumvent that limitation.<p>

<p>

<b>C.  The Act Violates Article I by Giving the President a
Unilateral Power to
Repeal Provisions of Law.</b><p>

     The sign-and-then-cancel device fails for a second, closely
related reason.  The
power to cancel provided by the Act is a power to repeal provisions
of law that
became law between one instant and five days earlier when the
President signed the
bill.  But repeal of a law, like enactment and amendment of a law,
is an act of
legislating, which requires passage by both Houses and presentment
to the
President.  Congress cannot, by statute, confer on the President
alone the power to
enact, amend, or repeal provisions of law.<p>

     In <i>Chadha</i>, the Supreme Court struck down a law allowing
a single House of
Congress in effect to <i>legislate</i> an individual's deportation
by vetoing a decision of
the Attorney General that would have allowed him to remain in the
United States. 
The Court held that such "an exercise of legislative power ... was
subject to the
standards prescribed in Art. I," including the requirements of
bicameral passage and
presentment to the President.  462 U.S. at 957.  <i>See also</i>
<i>Metropolitan Wash.
Airports Auth. v. Citizens for the Abatement of Aircraft Noise,
Inc.</i>, 501 U.S. 252,
274 n.19 (1991) ("when Congress legislates, when it makes binding
policy, it must
follow the procedures prescribed in Article I") (<i>quoting</i>
<i>Bowsher</i>, 478 U.S. at 757-59 (Opinion of Stevens, J.)).  <p>

     The <i>Chadha</i> principle applies no less to the repeal than
to the enactment of
federal law.  Indeed, in <i>Chadha</i> itself, the legislative
action at issue was the
effective repeal, through exercise of the one-House veto, of the
statutory delegation
of authority under which the Attorney General permitted Mr. Chadha
to remain in
the country.  <i>See</i> 462 U.S. at 952.  The Court's holding was
that "Amendment and
repeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with Art.
I."  <i>Id.</i> at 954. 
Removing a provision from the body of federal statutes in force is
just as much a
legislative action as adding or changing a provision.  <i><b>(See
Footnote 22)</b></i>  <i>Chadha</i>
makes clear that all such actions require passage by both Houses
and cannot be
accomplished by either House, or by the President.<p>

     The text of the Act makes it clear that the President has been
given the power to
repeal provisions of federal law without either bicameral passage
or presentment of
a repeal measure.  To be sure, the Act uses the word "cancel"
rather than "repeal,"
but Section 691e(4) defines "cancel" to mean, with respect to any
item of
discretionary budget authority, "to rescind," and with respect to
items of new direct
spending or limited tax benefits, "to prevent . . . from having
legal force or effect." 
All these words mean the same thing as "repeal" and produce the
same result:
provisions that have become law are removed from the body of
operative federal
statutes.  <i>See</i> pp. 8, 34 &amp; n. 20, <i>supra</i>.<p>

     The President's "cancellation" has exactly the same
consequences as a repeal: it
permanently eliminates a provision of statutory law.  If the
President later changes
his mind, or reaches a different judgment based on experience, he
cannot revive the
canceled item but must seek passage of a new law through the full
Article I process. 
Indeed, if he were to die in office or be defeated for reelection
and be succeeded by
a President with a different view of the national interest, the
successor President
could not bring the canceled item back.  On its face, this power of
permanent
cancellation precisely mirrors the power vested in Congress to
repeal the item, not
the power often granted to the President to decide continuously
whether, and if so
when, to make a particular expenditure.  <i>Cf.</i> <i>Field v.
Clark</i>, 143 U.S. 649, 692-93
(1892).  <i><b>(See Footnote 23)</b></i><p>

     The Department of Justice, in testimony before Congress,
defended the
constitutionality of the Act on the theory that it would merely
give the President
broad discretion to decline to spend appropriated amounts, so that
he could <i>execute</i>
the law as he sees fit within broad standards prescribed by
Congress.  This
explanation is on its face inapplicable to "limited tax benefits,"
such as a deduction
available to only a few taxpayers, which do not involve spending. 
Moreover, and
more fundamentally, it is obvious that cancellation of a limited
tax benefit is
changing the law.  The benefit, contained in a law signed by the
President, will at
least momentarily have become part of the Internal Revenue Code,
and the Act
effectively authorizes the President to strike it from the Code so
that it has no
further "legal force or effect."  In doing so, the President is
permanently stripping
taxpayers of a statutory right granted by a duly enacted federal
law.  The President's
action is identical in purpose and effect to the repeal of a
provision of the Internal
Revenue Code.  Similarly, with respect to new items of direct
spending, a
cancellation deprives individuals, or state or local governments,
of amounts to
which they were for at least a moment entitled under federal law. 
There is nothing
resembling an exercise of executive power or enforcement discretion
in either of
these contexts.<p>

     Equally, with respect to appropriations, the Act does not
delegate power to
execute the law; it authorizes the President to rewrite the law. 
The Act does not
establish a congressionally defined program within which the
President, from time
to time, exercises executive judgment.  Instead, the Act
effectively says to the
President: "For the next eight years, you may reshape future
statutes after signing
them into law.  You may do so in any area of government activity as
long as it
involves spending.  You may reshape statutes not yet conceived of
or written, and
the selection of items or programs to be eliminated is entirely up
to you.  The only
guide or limitation is that your reshaping must reduce the
authority to spend.  This
cancellation power may be exercised only once and only within five
days after you
sign a bill into law.  However, your cancellation decision is
final; neither you nor
you successor may revisit the issue, let alone reverse it."  This
is not a discretion to
<i>execute</i> the law as the President sees fit from time to time
in light of experience and
judgment.  This is a power to <i>repeal</i> the law as the
President sees fit.<p>

     The President's responsibilities in the lawmaking process are
to "recommend"
for Congress's "Consideration" measures that he "judge[s] necessary
and
expedient," and then, after exercising his Presentment Clause
obligations, to "take
care that the Laws be faithfully executed."  U.S. Const., Art. II,
sec. 3.  The Act,
however, seeks to excuse the President from his constitutionally
prescribed faithful
execution duty by authorizing him to reject, rather than to carry
out, duly enacted
spending and tax laws.  By conferring on the President the
unilateral power to
redetermine "the expediency or the just operation of such
legislation," <i>Field v.
Clark</i>, 143 U.S. at 693, based solely on his disagreement with
the policies enacted
by Congress, the Act is authorizing him to legislate.<p>

     In an apparent effort to create the appearance of a delegation
of authority, the
Act recites three determinations that the President is required to
make in connection
with a cancellation.  But any such appearance is an illusion: the
three determinations
tell the President only that he should exercise the same judgment
a lawmaker
would, and do not constrain his authority at all.  <p>

     The first, that the "cancellation ... will reduce the Federal
budget deficit"
(Section 691(a)(A)(i)), is almost a tautology: it will be true in
virtually every case. 
<i><b>(See Footnote 24)  </b></i>The other two determinations --
that the cancellation will "not
impair any essential Government functions" and "not harm the
national interest"
(Sections 691(a)(A)(ii)-(iii)) -- do not set standards or
boundaries that differentiate
"cancellation" from lawmaking.  Every legislative decision of the
Congress is surely
based on its judgment that "essential" government functions will
not be impaired
and that the national interest will not be "harmed."  The
President's participation in
the legislative process, i.e., his decision pursuant to the
Presentment Clause whether
he "approves" a bill and will sign it, is guided by the same
determinations.  In the
context of the Act, the instruction not to impair the public
interest is merely an
injunction not to <i>legislate</i> unwisely.<p>

     Delegated power is generally the power to fill gaps in the
laws that Congress has
passed.<i><b>  (See Footnote 25)</b></i>  Some federal statutes do
provide for a certain outcome
but expressly allow the President or a Cabinet officer to modify
that outcome.  But
in such instances, <i>see, e.g.</i>, <i>United States v.
Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.</i>, 299 U.S.
304 (1936); <i>J.W. Hampton, Jr. &amp; Co. v. United States</i>,
276 U.S. 394 (1928); <i>Field</i>,
143 U.S., at 692-94, the allowed modifications are defined by the
substantive law
itself, and the discretion to modify can be exercised in light of
experience and is not
arbitrarily confined to a one-time irreversible decision shortly
after the law is
enacted.  The cancellation authority conferred by the Act is an
open-ended
authority to the President to reshape future statutes as he thinks
best -- and that is
the power to legislate.  <i><b>(See Footnote 26)</b></i><p>

     Congress obviously could not give the President a general
power to revise
federal statutes as he sees fit (even subject to the limitation
that he not alter
anything he deems "essential" or make any change that would "harm
the national
interest").  Congress would not be "delegating" as that term has
traditionally been
used in the Nation's jurisprudence; it would be abdicating power
the Framers vested
solely in Congress and altering the tripartite, balanced structure
of Government
established by the Constitution.<p>

<p>

     Finally, defendants may argue that the Act is needed to meet
a fiscal crisis, but
the Supreme Court has squarely rejected arguments that practical
needs and
efficiencies warrant violation of constitutional procedures.  In
<i>Chadha</i>, the Court
rejected the "convenient shortcut," 462 U.S. at 958, of the
legislative veto.  The
Court recognized that the "sharing [of power]" made it "easier for
action to be
taken," <i>id.</i>, but it ruled that the Constitution serves a
more important purpose:
"[W]e have not yet found a better way to preserve freedom than by
making the
exercise of power subject to the carefully crafted restraints
spelled out in the
Constitution." <i>Id.</i> at 959.  Those restraints "erect ...
checks on each Branch and . . .
protect the people from the improvident exercise of power by
mandating certain
prescribed steps [for the passage or modification of legislation]." 
<i>Id.</i> at 957-58. 
<i>See also</i> <i>Bowsher</i>, 478 U.S. at 736.<p>

     The Act surrenders to the President a broad and important part
of Congress's
power to amend federal laws by canceling some of their provisions.

<b>18</b>     The President's role in enacting legislation was a
matter of considerable
importance during the Constitutional Convention.  On June 4, 1787,
the delegates
discussed whether the President should be limited to a qualified
rather than an
absolute veto.  1 Farrand at 97-105.  Alexander Hamilton and James
Wilson
proposed that the veto be absolute.  Roger Sherman, however, was
against
"enabling any one man to stop the will of the whole."  <i>Id.</i>
at 99.  After Benjamin
Franklin explained that, with an absolute veto, "The Executive will
be always
increasing here, as elsewhere, till it ends in a monarchy," the
state delegations voted
unanimously against the absolute veto power.  <i>Id.</i> at 103. 
The alternative of giving
the President the power to suspend legislative acts temporarily was
also
unanimously defeated.  <i>Id.</i> at 104.  The qualified veto
ultimately was approved,
eight to two.  <i>Id.</i>  After further debate on August 15 and
September 12, the

to increase the
required vote to three-quarters.  2 Farrand at 298-301; 585-87. <p>

power as "authority to

cancellation of
discretionary budget authority as "automatically rescind[ing] the

cancellation of other items as "render[ing] the provision void,
such that the
obligation of the United States has no legal force or effect." 
<i>Id.</i> at 22.<p>

<p>

<b>21</b>    The lawmaking requirements of Article I apply equally
to all laws passed by
Congress, but it is especially ironic that the Act focuses on the
very subjects the
Framers thought most central to the "legislative Power."  In the
Constitutional
Convention, the powers to appropriate and tax were the key to
resolving the
greatest conflict the Convention faced: whether representation in
the new Congress
should be proportional to population or equal for each state.  The
breakthrough
came on July 5, 1787, when the Special Committee, formed to find a
compromise,
proposed two linked clauses.  1 Farrand at 526.  The first clause
specified that all
money bills should be introduced by the first branch of the
legislature, and the
second gave each state an equal vote in the Senate.  <i>Id.</i> 
After much discussion, this
compromise was adopted on July 16.  2 Farrand at 15.  Although the
details of the
compromise were further refined, the power of initiating revenue
measures
remained with the House of Representatives, U.S. Const. Art. 1,
sec. 7, cl. 1, and
the authority to draw money from the Treasury was placed securely
under the law
making power, <i>id.</i> sec. 9, cl. 7.  As Madison put it, "This
power over the purse
may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon
with which
any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the
people, for obtaining
a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every
just and salutary
measure."  The Federalist No. 58.<p>

<p>

<b>22</b>    At the Constitutional Convention, Hugh Williamson,
George Mason, and
James Madison all explicitly noted their understanding that repeals
of law would
necessarily go through the presentment process.  2 Farrand at
586-87.<p>

<p>

<b>23</b>    The Act also violates the <i>Chadha</i> principle in
a second way.  It authorizes the
President not only to cancel appropriation amounts that appear in
a bill but also
amounts "represented separately in any table, chart, or explanatory
text included in
the statement of managers or the governing committee report
accompanying such
law."  Section 691e(7)(A)(ii).  The Act thus purports to give these
portions of the
legislative histories of future statutes the force of law.  But
these pieces of
legislative history will not have been enacted, or passed by even
one House of
Congress.  <i>Chadha</i> squarely forbids Congress from granting to
its own committees,
or to managers, the power to adopt provisions that have the force
of law.  <i>See</i>
<i>American Fed'n of Gov't Employees v. Pierce</i>, 697 F.2d 303,
306 (D.C. Cir. 1982)
(invalidating "grant of legislative power to two congressional
committees").<p>

<p>

<b>24</b>    This determination does bar exercise of the veto power
when there is no
federal budget deficit, but it has no significance outside such
Brigadoon years.<p>

<p>

<b>25    </b>As Justice Scalia observed in his concurring opinion
in <i>Loving v. United
States</i>, 116 S. Ct. 1737, 1753 (1996), the delegation doctrine
is misnamed, since
Congress cannot delegate legislative power but can only "assign
responsibilities to
the Executive; and when the Executive undertakes those assigned
responsibilities it
acts, not as the 'delegate' of Congress, but as the agent of the
People."  Therefore,
as the Court said in <i>Chadha</i>, Congress cannot assign to the
President functions that
are of a "legislative character," 462 U.S. at 952, which the
function of canceling a
law passed by Congress surely is.  <i>See also</i> <i>Field</i>,
143 U.S. at 692 ("That Congress
cannot delegate legislative power to the President is a principle
universally
recognized as vital to the integrity and maintenance of the system
of government
ordained by the Constitution").<p>

<p>

<b>26</b>    As we have demonstrated, Congress may not delegate to
the President the
power to repeal laws.  But even if such a power could be delegated,
it would have
to be circumscribed by meaningful standards governing its exercise. 
<i>See</i> <i>A.L.A.
Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States</i>, 295 U.S. 495, 553
(1935) (Cardozo, J.,
concurring); <i>see</i> <i>Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan</i>, 293
U.S. 388 (1935).  As the three-judge court noted in
<i>Synar</i>:<p>

<blockquote> [T]he ultimate judgment regarding the
constitutionality of a delegation must be made not on the basis of
the scope of the power alone, but on the basis of its scope

exercise.  When the scope increases to immense proportions (as in
<i>Schechter</i>) the standards must be correspondingly more
precise.</blockquote><p>

626 F. Supp. at 1386.  Since the power conferred under the Act is
certainly
"immense" and is not constrained at all, let alone by "precise"
standards, it fails to
satisfy even a traditional delegation analysis.<p>

PUBLIC CITIZEN LITIGATION GROUP<p>

BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY<p>

UNITED STATES SENATE<p>

REGARDING THE BALANCED BUDGET CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT</b><p>
</center>
<center><b>JANUARY 22, 1997</b></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
     Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, thank you for the
invitation to appear before this
Committee to testify regarding the Balanced Budget Constitutional
Amendment.  It is my
understanding that the Amendment being considered is the same as
the text of S.J. Res. 1 as reported
by the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995.  Accordingly, this
statement will, from time to time, refer
to S.J. Res. 1 and to certain of its sections to illustrate the
problems that I foresee if any such
Amendment becomes law.<p>

     I am now and have been for nearly 25 years an attorney with
the Litigation Group of Public
Citizen, an organization of more than 100,000 members that was
founded by Ralph Nader.  There
are 10 lawyers in our office who principally litigate cases in the
federal courts.  Among our areas of
specialty are administrative law, separation of powers, and the
Supreme Court.  With regard to the
subject areas covered by this hearing, we have litigated
impoundment questions both prior and
subsequent to the passage of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974,
and we were counsel for the
successful plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act.  I was also
lead counsel for the more than 100 Members of the House of
Representatives who challenged the
President's authority to commit U.S. Armed Forces to the escort
tanker operations in the Persian
Gulf, without complying with the War Powers Resolution, but whose
case was dismissed when the
courts refused to decide the merits.  I am currently one of the
counsel for the congressional plaintiffs
challenging the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act of 1996
in the case of <i>Byrd v. Raines</i>, No.
97-0001 (D.D.C. filed January 2, 1997).<p>

     My testimony today will not deal with constitutional theory
regarding what does and does not
belong in the United States Constitution, nor will I deal with
matters of economics or political
science.  Those subjects have been amply dealt with by others in
earlier hearings, although I would
note that, if a Balanced Budget Amendment does become law, we will
undoubtedly see many of the
gimmicks that I discuss from pages 17 to 23 of this statement in
describing what issues are likely to
arise and will require resolution by the courts or some other
institution.  Today I want to focus on
the question of how the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment,
if it becomes law, will be
enforced.<p>

     Every Member of Congress and every Officer of the United
States, from the President on down,
takes an oath to support and defend the laws of the United States,
which includes the Constitution,
but that oath applies equally to statutes, rules, and court
decisions.  Some supporters of the
Amendment have argued that, by placing the obligation for a
balanced budget in the Constitution,
there will be a significant increase in the willingness of Congress
and the President to enact balanced
budgets that would not occur if the same words were in the statute
books.  As I understand the
argument, the moral suasion of placing this command in the
Constitution would make a major
difference in compliance.  But legally, the obligation and the oath
of office make no such distinction,
and I personally doubt that Government officials regardless of
branch would treat a command for a
balanced budget differently if it became part of the Constitution. 
But if Congress disagrees, that only
reinforces my point that Congress should make it clear that
conscience and the oath of office are to
be the sole means of enforcing the Amendment.<p>

     There are three methods by which this Amendment could be
enforced: the courts, Presidential
impoundment, and the three-fifths vote to increase the debt of the
United States.  As former Attorney
General William Barr testified, Hearings before the  Committee on
the Judiciary, United States Senate
on S. J. Res. 1, January 5, 1995 at 121-22 ("1995 Hearings"), the
requirement in Section 2 that three-fifths of the whole number of
each House must approve an increase in the debt limit is largely
self-enforcing since the Treasury Department will never attempt to
sell bills or notes, representing
obligations of the United States, unless authorized to do so, and
if such an end run were attempted,
Wall Street would almost certainly refuse to purchase it.  I will
return to that problem later in my
testimony (pp 25-27), but for now I want to focus on the issues of
judicial review and impoundment.<p>

<center><b>Congress Must Decide on the Means of
Enforcement</b></center>
<p>

     It has often been said that war is too important to be left to
the generals, and so here, the question
of the judicial reviewability of compliance with S.J. Res. 1 is too
important to be left to federal
judges.  It is up to Congress to state loudly and clearly, in the
Amendment itself, whether it wishes
to make compliance with it subject to judicial review.  It is vital
for everyone who is asked to vote
on this Amendment in Congress, and in the States if they called
upon to ratify it, to know precisely
the extent to which the Judicial Branch will be involved in its
interpretation and implementation.  <p>

     When I first looked at this issue several years ago, I thought
that perhaps its sponsors had simply
not focussed on the issue of judicial review.  Perhaps, I thought,
they might have believed that there
was a ready and satisfactory answer so that there was no need to
say anything on the topic in the
Amendment itself.  I also thought that perhaps, because many of its
sponsors were not lawyers, let
alone lawyers who litigated cases involving constraints on the
federal budgetary process, they had not
thought through the consequences of what would happen if there were
judicial review, or if there
were not.  <p>

     There is no longer any doubt that the issue is a real one and
that the principal reason that there is
no answer in the Amendment itself is that there is no consensus on
what the answer should be.  The
issue was thoroughly debated before this Committee in 1995 and on
the floor of the Senate in both
1992 and 1995, and yet there is not a word in S. J. Res. 1 on how
Congress wishes to decide it.  In
fact, the 1995 version, that came within one vote of being approved
in the Senate, contained a
provision dealing with judicial review, sponsored by Senator Nunn,
although the House-passed
version did not.<p>

     Much of the 1995 testimony before this Committee given by an
array of distinguished legal
scholars concerned what the courts would do on the issue of
judicial review in the absence of any
direction in the Amendment itself.  I respectfully suggest that
that is the wrong question.  Because
this is the Constitution that is being amended, the sponsors have
the power -- and, I submit, the
obligation -- to spell out precisely whether there will be judicial
review or not, and if so, on what
terms.  The availability of judicial review, or lack thereof, in
other comparable situations may inform
the Committee on how it wishes to decide the issue here, but
nothing done in the past prevents those
who are amending the Constitution from providing whatever type or
level of judicial review they want
for decisions made under a Balanced Budget Amendment.<p>

     The same is true for enforcement through impoundment.  For
many years, Presidents have claimed
various powers to impound (refuse to spend) appropriate funds under
a variety of circumstances.  In
general, the courts rejected such claims in the absence of a
statute specifically granting the President
(or some other official) discretion not to spend all the funds that
were appropriated for a particular
program.  But the passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment would
change all of that rather
radically.  As then-Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger
testified at the 1995 Hearings, if the
Amendment became law, and if it appeared that the command for a
balanced budget in Section 1 was
about to be violated, he would advise the President that he not
only had the right, but also the
constitutional obligation, to step in and prevent the violation by
impounding money before the budget
became imbalanced (pp. 81-84, 70, 75).      <p>

     Although there is no clear answer, I believe that, especially
with no explicit judicial review
provision, the President would probably prevail.  That would mean
not only that he could refuse to
spend appropriated funds, but that he alone would decide which
programs to cut and which to spare. 
His power would not be confined to certain categories of spending
or limited to discretionary items;
it would extend to entitlements such as social security, medicare,
and the highway trust fund.  A
power to impound in this manner would make the Line Item Veto Act
look like a child's plaything.<p>

     Congress could attempt to control the President's discretion
by implementing legislation, if it could
reach agreement and if the President were willing to surrender his
unlimited discretion.  Even then
the President might argue that any attempt to restrict his
enforcement powers violated the
Amendment since it jeopardized a balanced budget, although I think
he should not prevail on that
claim, but the courts might disagree.  Indeed, if there were no
judicial review at all, that might be seen
as a decision to deny judicial review to the decisions of the
President to impound, even in violation
of enabling legislation.<p>

     There may be legitimate grounds for debate on whether, as a
matter of policy, there should or
should not be judicial review and whether there should or should
not be impoundment by the
President, if a Balanced Budget Amendment is enacted.  But there is
no reasonable basis to debate
that these choices are among the most significant that will be made
in constructing such an
Amendment, and it is the height of irresponsibility for this
Committee, or for the Congress as a whole,
to refuse to take a stand on both issues.  Guessing what the courts
might do is not a substitute for
accepting responsibility for deciding how to deal with judicial
review and impoundment.  Former
Attorney General Barr was candid when he said that he thought that
the Amendment itself should
take a position on judicial review, but then explained quite
poignantly why there is no such
clarification in S. J. Res. 1:  "But if I felt that that would mean
killing the amendment because I lost
support, I would seek to put it forth with clear legislative
history . . . "  (1995 Hearings at 139).  In
other words, if Members had to make a choice, or if they knew what
they were voting for, this
Amendment would never pass! Given the consequences of both judicial
review and no judicial review,
I can understand <i>why</i> the sponsors would prefer to sweep the
question under the rug, but I cannot
agree that such an approach is proper.  Indeed, although the
Amendment is part of what the Contract
With America calls the "Fiscal Responsibility Act," it would be the
height of <i>legislative
irresponsibility</i> for Congress to duck this vital question, and
the related question of Presidential
impoundment, before turning the Amendment loose on the states and
the public.  <p>

<center><b>The Likely Outcome if Congress Abdicates</b></center>
<p>

     If Congress nonetheless remains silent on judicial review, it
is my opinion that neither taxpayers,
legislators, nor citizens generally would have standing to go to
court to enforce the spending limits
in this Amendment.  On the other hand, in the absence of a clear
statement to the contrary in the
Amendment itself, it is likely that parties who claimed that, for
example, the requirements for revenue
increases in Section 4 had not been satisfied, <i>could</i> show
sufficient injury to meet the case or
controversy requirement in Article III of the Constitution.  The
same is also true for those objecting
to a Presidential impoundment.  Thus, those seeking greater
spending or reduced taxes could have
their claims adjudicated, whereas actions to assure lesser spending
will be thrown out of court for
lack of standing.  The end result will be that this litigation bias
will further increase the deficit,
precisely the opposite of what the proponents of the Amendment are
seeking.  <p>

     It is also possible that other reasons for the courts refusing
to hear suits, such as the political
question doctrine, would preclude judicial review of alleged
violations of this Amendment. 
Therefore, unless Congress intends to foreclose review, it must act
affirmatively to provide for it now,
in the Amendment, and not just in its legislative history.  Nor
should Congress assume that
implementing legislation can solve the problem.  It would have to
be enacted over a near-certain
Presidential veto, and the courts might conclude that Congress
lacks the power to confer jurisdiction
in the federal courts to resolve disputes under this Amendment. 
Thus, unless modified in this
Amendment, the requirements of an Article III case or controversy
would still control and could not
be changed by Congress.<p>

     Predictions regarding the legality of possible Presidential
impoundments are also hazardous, but
my present view is that, especially if there is no express judicial
review provision, the courts would
uphold presidential impoundment (assuming the courts would
entertain a challenge to it).  My opinion
is based on the clear statements by the Administration of its
intent to use the power, the failure of
Congress to prohibit him from doing so, and the assumption that
major constitutional provisions
should not be entirely unenforceable, absent highly unusual
circumstances.  As noted above, these
predictions are relevant principally to delineate the consequences
of no action on these crucial issues,
not to suggest that they are satisfactory answers to the questions
or a valid excuse for inaction.<p>

<center><b>The Options on Judicial Review</b></center>
<p>

     Once Congress recognizes that it must take a position 
regarding judicial review, it has three
choices.  All actions taken in purported violation of the Amendment
could be subject to judicial
review, no such actions could be subject to judicial review, or
some of them could.  The last
alternative is the least attractive.  Besides having the problems
discussed below that are associated
with the two polar positions, it has the further disadvantage of
producing litigation over whether a
given claim is litigable, a debate which profits no one save the
lawyers who are being paid to litigate
it, and it leaves to the unelected Judiciary the crucial job of
deciding which cases it will hear and
which ones it will refuse even to consider.  I can think of nothing
less appropriate in this area than
to turn the issue of reviewability over to the federal courts. 
<b><i>(See Footnote 1)</b></i>  I first want to discuss
the non-justiciability option and then discuss what living with the
Amendment would be like if
Congress opts for full judicial review.<p>

<center><i><b>The No Judicial Review Option</b></i></center>
<p>

     In theory, there is nothing wrong with precluding judicial
review of constitutional provisions.  For
instance, each House decides, pursuant to Article I, Section 5,
Clause 3, whether its journal of
proceedings shall be made public, and its decisions are not subject
to judicial review.  Similarly, if the
government ever conferred a title of nobility, contrary to Article
I, Section 9, Clause 8, no one could
challenge that in court, but that would not be such a serious
matter.  More significantly, Article I,
Section 6, Clause 1 specifically insulates the speech and debate of
Members of Congress from being
questioned in any other forum.  While conduct involving these and
other provisions in the
Constitution is immune from judicial scrutiny, none of these
activities has so fundamental an effect
on the well-being of the country as would this Amendment.<p>

     One way to examine the effect of making S.J. Res. 1 judicially
unenforceable is to look at two
statutes for which there is essentially no judicial review.  The
first is the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
Act, which is the statutory precursor of S.J. Res. 1.  I do not
intend to debate the impact of that
statute; it probably has had some effect, but not nearly as much as
its sponsors had promised.  It has
one feature that has substantially eliminated the need for judicial
review and that is the automatic
sequestration.  While there is a broad anti-judicial review
provision in Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, if
the President failed to issue the sequestration order as the
statute directs him to do, a court would
almost certainly order him to carry out that largely ministerial
act.  On the other hand, there is no
review of any of the crucial estimates under the statute that
determine whether the budget targets will
be met or not.  I would also note that the statute is much longer,
is far more detailed, and thus gives
much less to litigate, than does the less than a page and a half in
S.J. Res. 1.  Most important of all,
unlike a statute that can be fine-tuned from time-to-time, the
Balanced Budget Constitutional
Amendment is cast in stone, or at least until the time-consuming
amendment process can correct it. 
As the Congress has shown several times in the past, Gramm-Rudman
is amendable, if the votes of
both Houses are there to pass a change.<p>

     Perhaps more poignant than Gramm-Rudman is the effect of
non-enforcement on the War Powers
Resolution.  This statute, which was passed by two-thirds of the
Senate and House over the veto of
then-President Richard Nixon in 1973, when he was at one of his
weakest moments in his relationship
with Congress, was the great congressional hope for controlling the
President and the war-making
power.  As we all know, that hope was quickly dashed, and it is now
apparent to all that the War
Powers Resolution has no teeth.  <p>

     This became absolutely clear to me when I was counsel for more
than 100 Members of the House
of Representatives who sought to require President Reagan to do no
more than to send to Congress
the statement required by the Resolution regarding the activities
that he had undertaken in the Persian
Gulf to protect Kuwaiti tankers.  Our lawsuit did not seek to stop
the escort operations or to require
the President to do or not do anything other than submit a simple
report to Congress that met the
statutory requirements of the War Powers Resolution.  Indeed, the
President never defended his
refusal to comply with the statute on the merits, but simply said
that the courts had no business
getting into this controversy.  Eventually, the courts agreed and
dismissed the case.  While one can
read the published opinion of the district court and the brief
unpublished order of the court of appeals
and debate their legal meaning, the Judiciary's message to Congress
is quite clear:  keep these cases
out of our courts because we are not going to rescue you.<p>

     As a result, the War Powers Resolution has no impact
whatsoever.  It leaves Congress in the
position that it was in before the Resolution:  if both Houses can
muster two-thirds of the Members,
Congress can prevent the President from engaging in war-making
activities, but it cannot do so
without those votes.  Obviously, the War Powers Resolution is not
needed to achieve that end.  But
perhaps worse than being ineffective, it has prevented Congress
from making other efforts to control
the President.  The matter has gotten so bad now that, when
war-making activities commence, the
popular press now believes that it is Congress that must "invoke"
the War Powers Resolution, by
trying to stop the President, rather than the President who must
comply with the Resolution by
sending the necessary reports and meeting the statutory deadlines. 
It seems to me that the experience
under these two statutes makes clear the real danger of no judicial
review; if the Amendment is
enacted, and then it is routinely disregarded, it will make the
situation worse than if there were no
Amendment at all.<p>

     When I have raised the specter of a toothless Balanced Budget
Amendment, the usual response
is that Congress and the President will honor it anyway because it
is in the Constitution.  Would that
it were so.  Does anyone believe that the First, Fourth, Fifth,
Tenth or Fourteenth Amendments, to
mention just a few, would be respected by our governments if the
federal judiciary were not there to
back up the words with court orders?  The President is no less
obligated to follow the dictates of the
War Powers Resolution than he would be of the Balanced Budget
Constitutional Amendment, but
no President has complied with the former, despite its clear
mandates, and there is no reason to
believe that any President will follow the latter, unless it suits
his or her political objectives at the
time.  And given Congress's failure to meet various deficit
reducing requirements over the years, I
would be very surprised if Congress did not join the President in
routinely disregarding the
Amendment if their actions are immune from judicial review.<p>

     To be sure, the President, but not the Congress, could be
impeached for violating his constitutional
obligations to have a balanced budget, but he is only one actor in
the process.  As for Members of
Congress, they can be voted out, after the fact, although there is
no indication of any willingness on
the part of the electorate to do so when Members have failed to
live up to their budgetary
responsibilities under Gramm-Rudman and elsewhere.  More
importantly, balancing the budget does
not seem to be the kind of single issue on which Members of
Congress lose their right to return to
Washington, especially for Senators who are elected only once every
six years. <p>

<center><i><b>The Litigation Option</b></i></center>
<p>

     In discussing the litigation option, I want to describe the
steps envisioned by the Amendment and
then point out some of the questions that the courts would almost
certainly be called upon to resolve. 
Section 3 of S.J. Res. 1 requires that "[p]rior to each Fiscal
Year, the President shall submit to the
Congress a proposed budget for the United States Government for
that fiscal year in which total
outlays do not exceed total receipts."  First, Section 3 leaves
open the critical issue of when the
President must transmit his proposed budget to Congress.  Would it
be proper for him to send the
budget on September 30th for the Fiscal Year starting October 1st? 
Normally, the budget precedes
the State of the Union Address which is given in January, but the
absence of any explicit requirement
suggests that the President need not submit his budget at the time
of the State of the Union and hence
would be free to submit it when he thought it was convenient.<p>

     The Section also requires that, in the President's budget,
"total outlays do not exceed total
receipts."  Does this mean that the numbers must simply add up (I
assume that, for political as well
as other reasons, the President could not say that two plus two
equals five, or three), or does it mean
more?  Could the President optimistically project a 2 or 5 or 10%
growth in the economy, from which
the tax revenues will increase accordingly, or is he stuck with
last year's figures?  Would the President
comply if his budget included a "saving" from "fraud, waste, and
abuse" of $250 billion this year,
especially if there are similar (and unrealized) savings for each
of the last five years?  Would it be
proper for the President to include the savings from the demise of
50 programs that Congress has
repeatedly refused to eliminate in the past?  Or must the budget
have some aura of reality to it?<p>

     Turning to Section 1, which is the heart of the Amendment, it
provides that "Total outlays for any
fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that year, unless
three-fifths of the whole number of each
House shall provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over
receipts by a rollcall vote."  The first
question is, what is the impact or effect of such a provision? 
Reading the first part of the provision,
it appears that the Amendment is simply announcing a result,
without any direction to anyone as to
how the result is to be achieved.  What if the budget turns out to
be out of balance at the end of the
year, which is the first time that actual outlays and receipts will
be known?  Can anyone do anything
about it at that late date, or is it grounds for impeachment of the
President or removal of Members
of Congress from office?  Or would it operate like the carryover
provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code, such that a shortfall in one year would have to be offset by
further cuts the following year?  
<p>

     The second part of Section 1 suggests a possible alternative
reading.  It provides that an excess
of outlays can occur if three- fifths of each House approves it. 
Under that reading, both parts of
Section 1 would be directed to the President and Congress, in
essence forbidding them to vote for
an unbalanced budget.  But is voting for a balanced budget all that
is required, or must the balance
actually occur?  It is difficult to fathom how the first phrase in
Section 1 can mean both, yet unless
it does, it is hard to see how the Amendment could have the
practical impact that its sponsors seek. 
<p>

     If the courts have to sort that out, they will probably
conclude that actual balance, not phony
accounting, is what the sponsors intended.  But suppose that,
despite approving a budget that was
in balance when enacted (again assuming reasonable estimates and
good faith), unemployment
increases dramatically  -- raising expenses and reducing tax
receipts -- and that money is being spent
at a rate that, by the end of the year, will result in the
Constitution being violated.  A lawsuit is then
brought, presumably to enjoin the excess spending, and the parties
and the courts are left in the
position of having to determine, at a fixed point in time, whether
the Constitution is going to be
violated later that fiscal year.  <p>

     If such a lawsuit were allowed to go forward, the federal
courts would be in the business of having
to review all of the complicated budget data to decide whether the
spending laws were in compliance
with the Constitution, on a highly accelerated schedule, with new
data coming in all the time, with
conflicting opinions on the meaning of that data from experts
retained by the various parties (plus the
many others who are likely to want to join in the battle), and with
the extraordinary time pressures
that the inevitable end of the Fiscal Year places upon the
litigants and the trial judge, let alone the
judges in the courts of appeals and the Supreme Court.  Presumably,
this would call upon the courts
to enter temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions
regarding spending, since awaiting
the end results for that Fiscal Year would obviously be
inconsistent with the purpose of the
Amendment, which is to prevent spending in violation of its
terms.<p>

     Assuming that these problems could be surmounted (which I
rather doubt), there would be the
question of remedy.  One of the virtues of Gramm-Rudman is that,
when cuts had to be made, the
statute was quite clear as to how they should be carried out.  This
Amendment says nothing on that
issue.  Thus, if spending must be cut, will all appropriations be
reduced on an across-the-board basis,
or will some other method be employed?  If Congress attempts to
establish such a method, will that
be upheld, or will the Constitution be read to mandate something
else?  What about the protections
for the President and federal judges against salary reduction? 
Will they continue to apply, and even
if they do, what will happen to their staffs?  Will the departments
have discretion to furlough
employees, or will everyone have to work at reduced pay or reduced
hours, or some of each?  And
how will the federal courts decide all of these questions?<p>

     So far, I have not dealt with what is probably the biggest
problem which S.J. Res. 1 attempts to
answer in Section 7, by its all-inclusive definitions of receipts
and outlays:<p>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Total receipts shall include all receipts of the
United States Government except those
derived from borrowing.  Total outlays shall include all outlays of
the United States Government
except those for repayment of debt principal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;<p>

Initially, I would note that the accounting method used for both
receipts and outlays is cash, unlike
most large entities which use the accrual method.  Thus, it is not
the obligations of the government
that matter, but only the amount of money actually spent in the
sense of checks written.  This fact
makes manipulation easy, by postponing payment of admitted
obligations that any sensible person
would believe ought to be counted toward the fiscal year in which
they occurred and in which the
benefits were received.  The question will undoubtedly arise as to
whether payments that are plainly
late may be counted in the next fiscal year, rather than in the one
in which they were due.  Moreover,
the focus on actual receipts and outlays will require very close
scrutiny of thousands of expenditures
to determine when the actual payment was made or received.  For
example, will the operative date
be when the check is written, deposited, or received for collection
by the Treasury of the United
States?       <p>

     A number of witnesses in prior hearings, as well as the
sponsors of this Amendment, have
indicated that items such as the social security trust fund, the
money set aside for the RTC, and the
highway and airport trust funds would all be included within this
broad definition.  <b><i>(See Footnote 2)</i></b> 
I see no reason to disagree with that assessment, but believe that
it is simply the beginning of the
inquiry.  For instance, what about entities such as AMTRAK, the
Smithsonian, and the Legal Services
Corporation which receive some, but not exclusive federal funding? 
Are they part of the Government
of the United States for these purposes so that their budgets are
counted in the balance?  The same
could be asked of the Postal Service, which used to be part of the
government and still receives
substantial government subsidies.  But suppose that it runs a
deficit; will that be counted against the
total?  <p>

     Other quasi-government entities, which are not agencies for
many purposes, might or might not
be counted against the federal budget.  Included in these would be
the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, the National Academy of Sciences, and government
sponsored entities such as Fanny
Mae and Sally Mae.  There is more than ample ground for litigation
over each of these entities, and
given the size of their budgets, it may well be that the questions
will be quite significant, at least in
some cases.  And, assuming that some of them are covered, will they
be treated identically to all other
government agencies if there is overspending, or will some other
method of expense reduction be
used, and if so, who will devise it and on what basis?  And if any
of these quasi-government entities
turns a profit, can that be used to offset a loss elsewhere?  Then,
of course, there is the possibility of
a whole new generation of entities -- no one heard of the RTC when
Gramm-Rudman became law --
for which there will be a whole new generation of litigation, not
to mention negotiations in Congress
over their status when they are created.<p>

     Undoubtedly, at some point the budget crunch will start to be
felt, and Congress will be creative,
as it has been in the past, in finding ways to avoid this
Amendment.  I fully envision new meaning
given to the term "off-budget," as Congress attempts to shift to
the states, or more likely private
parties, obligations that were formerly undertaken by the federal
government.<p>

     Take the issue of health care, in particular the cost of
Medicare and Medicaid.  A creative
Congress might well direct the private health care system to pick
up Medicare and Medicaid patients,
allowing increased premiums to cover costs, but with no government
funding whatsoever.  This
would be rather like the ultimate assigned risk pool for automobile
insurance.  There would, of
course, have to be a complex regulatory scheme to see that the law
was administered in a reasonably
fair manner, but the cost of that system would be far less to the
federal government than the Medicare
and Medicaid costs that would be shifted to employers in what is
essentially a hidden tax on the
businesses or on other entities who must pay health insurance
premiums.<p>

     Surely, some clever lawyer would argue that this scheme is in
fact a tax, that it was not voted on
in accordance with Section 4 of this Amendment, and that the
imposition of the hidden tax violated
the Constitution.  The Supreme Court has recognized, in a somewhat
analogous area, that not only
physical takings are covered by the Fifth Amendment, but that the
Takings Clause applies when the
government so substantially regulates a person's property that it
has no use left at all.  Thus, it could
easily be argued that this kind of law would be "regulatory
spending," as opposed to governmental
spending, and it too should be outlawed by the Constitution.  Do
you want the courts to decide that
question, or should the entire issue be immune from judicial
review?<p>

     Moreover, if the privatization precedent works in the health
care area, Congress might well apply
it to efforts to clean up the environment and to protect workers,
and even to replace social security
pensions with a private pension system, all mandated by law, none
of which would "cost" the federal
government anything, in order to assure that it has a balanced
budget.  Undoubtedly, some types of
regulation will be upheld, but there will be good grounds for
litigation in some of the more extreme
cases.<p>

     Another area for litigation is created in Section 1 by the
three-fifths requirement "for a specific
excess of outlays over receipts."  Leaving aside the question how
specific a "specific excess" vote
must be (must it be on an item by item basis or is an overall vote
satisfactory), what if five Senators
wanted an excess, but refused to go along with the budget without
it, so that there were neither 50
votes for the budget nor 60 for the excess?  Or suppose the House
had 50% and the Senate 60%, and
neither of them would budge?   Similar kinds of questions and
problems exist with respect to the
provision in Section 2 requiring a three-fifths vote to increase
the public debt (assuming that the term
can be defined without an excessive amount of litigation), and to
increase revenue, as required by
Section 4.  And, of course, it is unclear what would happen if the
various provisions of the
Amendment result in conflicts that prevent either the raising of
revenue or spending it because outlays
and estimated receipts do not coincide.<p>

     Most intriguing of all is Section 5, which provides that
"Congress may waive the provisions of this
article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in
effect."  Perhaps this would be a means
of reviving the War Powers Resolution, by putting pressure on the
President to ask Congress to
declare war in order to avoid the consequences of an unbalanced
budget.  That effect might be a cute
way of controlling the President's war-making activities, but is it
a sensible one?  Surely, it would not
have been advisable in August 1990 to have declared war on Iraq
simply to enable additional money
to be spent on the pre-war build-up.<p>

     More importantly, most wars are not fought based on a
congressional declaration, and even those
that are, need money for preparations before the war begins. 
Indeed, this provision seems to invite
Congress to refuse appropriations and demand as a price the request
of the President for a declaration
of war.  If this is not what this Section means, the courts will
have to sort it out.<p>

     It might be useful to look at the other end of the war process
as well, focusing on the question of
when a declaration of war ceases to be "in effect."  Would Congress
have to vote to "undeclare war,"
or would a declaration of war, like the temporary emergency court
of appeals, continue for more than
20 years because no one had ever revoked it?  Could the war be a
permanent cold war that existed
from 1945 until 1991, or would the courts require that a war be a
shooting war in order to constitute
an exception, and then would judges be in the business of deciding
when hostilities began and/or
ended to assure that there was no violation of this Section?<p>

     There is another area that will certainly cause lawsuits and
is probably unwise from a policy
perspective as well.  S.J. Res. 1 focuses solely on the cash flow
of the government, more or less like
an individual's checkbook.  But no sensible person looking at the
finances of any entity would
examine simply the income statement without looking at the balance
sheet as well.  Moreover, no
properly run business would operate without a capital as well as an
operating budget.  Yet, since S.J.
Res. 1 limits only cash flow, that is likely to encourage a number
of dubious practices that either make
no economic sense, or be subject to litigation, or both.  For
example, it will always be "cheaper," from
an annual cash flow perspective, for the government to lease a
building than to purchase it, although
in the long run the cost will often be much higher by choosing the
lease option.  Yet the focus on
short-term outlays will inevitably drive the government into
leasing rather than purchasing, unless the
court forbids that subterfuge or encourages the opposite by
allowing the President and Congress to
"count" only a percentage of this year's purchase price, a result
that would be hard to justify given
the broad definition of outlays, since the only exception is for
debt repayments.<p>

     Second, the government could easily sell assets, either
because they are not producing revenue,
or because the receipts would generate cash that would alleviate
some of the budget problems. 
Perhaps Congress would not attempt to sell the White House to a
private developer, who would lease
it back to the President, nor would it dispose of Glacier National
Park to an outdoor recreation
company, but there are other dispositions of assets that would be
less of a national disgrace and hence
a greater temptation to those who were worried about staying within
the constitutional budget
limitations for a given year, but not worried about the ultimate
future of our country.  Of course, for
each of these attempted subterfuges, someone would surely argue
that they violate the spirit, if not
the letter, of this amendment, and the courts would have to decide
the legality of each of them.<p>

<center><i><b>The Danforth and Nunn Amendments</b></i></center>
<p>

     In 1992 the Senate adopted an amendment offered by Senator
Danforth to S.J. Res. 41, under
which there would be judicial review, in at least some cases, but
under which the courts could only
issue declaratory relief unless Congress specifically authorized
another form of relief through
implementing legislation.  Senator Nunn sponsored a similar
provision again in 1995, and a modified
version became part of the final version of Section 6 of H.J. Res.
1 that came within one vote of
passage in the Senate: "The judicial power of the United States
shall not extend to any case of [sic]
controversy arising under this Article except as may be
specifically authorized by legislation adopted
pursuant to this section."   141 Cong. Rec. S. 3312 (March 2, 1995,
daily ed.).<p>

     If the Nunn addition were to be included, it still leaves open
the vital issue of standing by not
saying <i>who</i> can sue to enforce the Amendment.  In fact, its
reference to "case or controversy"
suggests, if it does not require, that the usual standing rules
would apply, even if Congress passed full
enabling legislation. That would probably mean that only those
whose taxes were improperly
increased, or whose funding was unlawfully cut off, would ever have
standing.  Thus, if a taxpayer
or legislator claimed that the budget was not properly in balance,
and even if Congress provided
standing for them in enabling legislation, the Nunn addition would
probably not permit that person
to sue over an alleged violation.  Accordingly, while I applaud the
willingness of Senator Nunn to
address the issue of judicial review, and recognize that his
amendment eliminated some of the
problems that the Danforth amendment contained, it did not answer
the most fundamental issue
regarding judicial review: would anyone be entitled to sue when a
budget was not in balance,
assuming Congress passed a statute permitting such a lawsuit? 
<b><i>(See Footnote 3)</b></i><p>

<center><b>Enforcement through the Debt Ceiling
Provision</b></center>
<p>

     I am deeply troubled by the prospect of judicial review and
Presidential impoundment, and by the
fact that S.J. Res. 1 refused to deal with either of them.  But in
some ways the most troubling aspect
of the Amendment is what is contained in Section 2: "The limit on
the debt of the United States held
by the public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of the
whole number of each House shall
provide by law for such an increase by a rollcall vote."<p>

     As the Committee knows, it is virtually impossible to have an
unbalanced budget without having
to raise the debt ceiling.  And, unlike the budget itself, whose
status as being in balance or not is
always subject to reasonable debate, especially at the start of a
fiscal year when Congress must rely
on estimates, it is generally quite clear when the debt ceiling
must be raised.  To be sure, Secretary
of Treasury Rubin engaged in some maneuvers that delayed the matter
for a couple of weeks, but
even he soon ran out of tricks, and the ceiling had to be raised or
the Government could not finance
its operations.  The necessity to raise money outside the
Government will become, as former Attorney
General Barr observed, a self-enforcing method of assuring that the
budget does not go out of
balance.<p>

     The problem is that this power is given to two-fifths of
either House, and there is absolutely
nothing that the remainder of Congress, the President, or the
courts can do about it.  Surely, no one
would attempt to sell billions of dollars of debt unless they were
authorized to do so, and even if
someone tried, there would be no buyers.  The Committee will recall
the near chaos in 1995 when
the Government was twice shut down, and how close we came to not
getting it open again, when all
that was needed was a majority.  But suppose that those opposed to
increasing the debt ceiling were
not the majority party, and they were willing to shut down the
government to assure that the budget
was in balance, as they saw it.   This Amendment would, in essence,
turn over control of our
Government to 41 Senators or 175 Representatives, virtually ending
the principle of majority rule. 
<p>

     As frightening as are the prospects of full judicial review or
unlimited presidential impoundment,
I am even more frightened by the idea that we will be allowing
two-fifths of either House to halt an
increase in the debt ceiling.  Indeed, their reasons for objection
to the increase may have nothing to
do with a balanced budget.  Rather, they may simply seize the debt
ceiling increase as an opportunity
to insist on cuts or even increases in some specific programs, not
to mention holding the debt ceiling
as a hostage to demand that the President withdraw a treaty or a
Supreme Court nomination.  Of
course, such strong-arm tactics can always be tried, but having to
muster only 40% of either House
makes it much more likely that they will succeed.  The Framers
established a government of majority
rule, and this is no place to alter that basic assumption.<p>

<b><center>*  *  *</b></center>
<p>

     In conclusion, I want to urge the Committee again to consider
how the Balanced Budget
Amendment will be enforced, to answer the questions relating to
judicial review and impoundment
in the Amendment itself, and to eliminate the ability of two-fifths
of either House to bring the
Government of the United States to a halt.  I thank the Committee
for the invitation, and I stand
ready to answer any questions that you may have.<p>

;<p>
<ol>
<b><li></b>  These and other problems relating to the Danforth and
Nunn amendments, which take a middle
ground, are discussed at the end of this statement at pages
23-25.<p>

<b><li></b>  Various proposals have been floated to exclude social
security from the Amendment,
presumably as a means of attracting additional votes.  Given the
size of social security, to allow it to
run at a deficit would undermine the whole concept of a balanced
budget.  Moreover, there is no
definition of social security in the Constitution and it would be
extremely unwise and productive of
litigation and political maneuvering to try to write one.  If there
is to be a Balanced Budget
Constitutional Amendment, there should  be no exceptions.<p>

<b><li></b>  Some observers questioned whether the Nunn and
Danforth amendments would nonetheless
allow suits in state courts, because the exclusion applies only to
the "judicial power of the United
States."  It is not clear that state courts have any power to order
Congress or the President to do or
not do anything, nor do I share the view that the Nunn amendment
would be construed to allow state
courts what is forbidden to federal courts.  If this approach were
adopted, it would be advisable to
eliminate the debate by adding the phrase "or of any state,
territory or other unit of government" after
"judicial power of the United States."  However, to assure that the
ordinary rules do not bar Congress
from conferring standing on either taxpayers, Members, or the
President to sue to enforce the
requirements of Section 1, that power must be specifically set
forth in the Amendment itself.<p></ol>

<center><b>LEGISLATIVE SUMMARY</b></center>
<p>
<center><b>HISTORY OF THE LINE ITEM VETO ACT OF 1996</b></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<p>

     <b>1.  <i>The House of Representatives</i> </b><p>

     On January 3, 1995, H.R. 2 was introduced and referred to the
Committee on Government
Reform and Oversight.  <i>See</i> H.R. 2, 104th Cong. 1st Sess.
(1995).  The bill was a broad-ranging
"enhanced rescission" line item veto, under which the President had
20 days after a bill is enacted
to veto items which he disapproved.  It entitled the President to
"rescind all or part of any
discretionary budget authority."  Sec. 2(a).  His authority was not
limited to items in the statute
itself, but included identifiable items in the legislative history. 
The bill provided that any
budgetary authority that is rescinded "shall be deemed canceled
unless" the Congress overrides it,
Sec. 3(a)(1), and that "any provision of law <i>vetoed</i> under
this Act . . . shall be deemed <i>repealed</i>
unless  . . . a rescission/receipts disapproval bill restoring that
provision is enacted into law."  Sec.
3(a)(2) (emphasis added).  In addition, it also authorized the
President to "<i>veto</i> any targeted tax
benefit" (one limited to a few persons), subject to the same
two-thirds override.  Sec. 2 (emphasis
added).<p>

     On January 12, 1995, the House Government Reform and Oversight
Committee held a joint
hearing with the Senate Government Affairs Committee, at which the
only dissenting witness was
Chief Judge Gilbert S. Merritt of the Sixth Circuit, who, as
Chairman of the Executive Committee
of the Judicial Conference, expressed concern about the policy
implications of a presidential line
item veto for appropriations for the judiciary.  <i>See</i> H.R.
Rep. No. 11, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. 13
(January 30, 1995) ("House Report").  A markup was held on January
25, 1995, and the bill was
reported favorably, with amendments, by a roll call vote of 30-11. 
<i>Id.</i> at 12.  <p>

     There were several committee decisions of note.  The period
during which the President had
the right to veto items was shortened from the original 20 calendar
days (not including Saturdays,
Sundays, or holidays), to 10 calendar days, not including Sundays. 
<i>Id.</i> at 2.  The term "targeted
tax benefit" was expanded somewhat so that the maximum size of the
group of taxpayers whose
benefits could be vetoed went from five in the bill as introduced
to 100.  <i>Id.</i> at 2, 26, 27.  An
attempt to exclude the judiciary was defeated by a vote of 17-29,
<i>id.</i> at 21, and efforts to sunset
the legislation were turned back by a vote of 17-22.  <i>Id.</i> at
31, 35.  <p>

     The House Report was clear about the purpose of H.R. 2: "to
change the tilt of the game from
one that favors spending to one that favors saving."  <i>Id.</i> at
7.  In discussing the problem which the
President had in obtaining congressional approval of rescissions,
the Report stated that the bill
"reverses the burden.  Presidential proposals will now become law
unless Congress takes action to
stop them."  <i>Id.</i> at 9.<p>

     Several other references clarify how the bill was intended to
work.  Thus, the committee
observed that its bill "strengthens the President's ability to
rescind (cancel) appropriated funds.  It
also allows the President to <i>eliminate</i> targeted tax benefits
. . .. "  <i>Id.</i> at 8 (emphasis added). 
Although the report refers to the actions of the President as
"recommendations" that various items
"be terminated," the report confirms that no prior action by
Congress is required since the
"recommendations will automatically become law after a fixed period
of time, unless Congress,
during a designated review period, votes by bill or joint
resolution to disapprove."  <i>Id</i>;  <i>see</i> <i>also</i>
<i>id.</i> at 10 (budget authority or targeted tax benefits will
automatically be terminated after a fixed
number of days unless Congress acts by a bill or joint resolution
to disapprove the President's
proposal); <i>id.</i> at 14 ("Any provision of law, as set forth in
a President's special message, shall be
deemed <i>repealed</i> unless a rescission/receipts disapproval
bill restoring that provision is enacted
into law.") (emphasis added).  <p>

     Although line item veto supporters often referred to the
experience of the states with the item
veto, the House Report recognized that "H.R. 2 differs
fundamentally from the kind of item veto
authority granted to governors in 43 states."  <i>Id.</i> at 11. 
Whereas state appropriations bills are
highly itemized, federal laws are not, and the Committee sees "no
reason to do so" because that
would "add an undesirable rigidity to agency operations." 
<i>Id.</i> Instead, Congress could continue to
appropriate with lump sums, and the President could "propose for
reduction or elimination any
dollar amount specifically identified in a bill or committee report
or joint explanatory statement
accompanying a conference report on that Act," so that the
President would have "greater power
and discretion than he would have with item veto authority." 
<i>Id.</i> at 12. <p>

     House floor consideration of the bill occurred on February 2,
3, and 6, 1995, 141 Cong. Rec.
H.1078-1142; 1168-1191; 1225-1264 (daily ed.), and was generally
less noteworthy for what was
said than for the amendments that were offered and rejected. 
<i><b>(See Footnote 1)</i> </b>Initially, two
amendments were adopted unanimously.  The first, offered by
Representative Clinger, the
Chairman of the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, was
intended to clarify that,
although the bill permits the President to look to legislative
history and thereby go behind
appropriations bills, he "may not look to Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) or agency
justifications or other types of documents to rescind funds for
programs not specified by
Congress."  H.1106.  It was also intended to assure that the
President "may only rescind dollar
amounts, not bill language . . . [contrary to the practice] in some
states [where] the Governor
does have the power to actually effect statutory language." 
H.1106.  Another amendment,
sponsored by Representative Pelosi, was along similar lines and
specified that the President may
not "change any prohibition or limitation of discretionary budget
authority set forth in any
appropriations act."  H.1107.  <p>

     Most of the amendments offered were rejected.  Representative
Moran offered an amendment,
comparable to the one that had been previously rejected in
committee, to remove the authority to
rescind budgetary authority for the judicial branch.  H.1107.  That
amendment was rejected by a
vote of 119-309.  H.1115.  Three separate efforts were defeated to
broaden the authority of the
President to cut back on tax benefits of various kinds.  H.1116,
H.1125, H.1168, H.1170,
H.1235, H.1255.  Two other attempts to alter the scope of the
rescission authority were also
turned back.  Representative Skelton moved to limit the President's
cancellation authority to $50
million of discretionary budget authority and to exclude "any
program, project, or activity within
the major functional category for national defense."  H.1130.  That
amendment was defeated by a
vote of 52-362.  H.1138.  Representative Orton attempted to bring
contract authority within the
scope of the line  item veto, H.1225-34, but that was defeated by
a recorded vote of 65-360. 
H.1254.  An effort was made to impose a sunset date of January 1,
2000, H.1139, but that, too,
was strongly opposed by supporters and rejected by a vote of
153-258.  H.1142.       <p>

     The single most crucial vote was on an "expedited rescission"
substitute offered by
Representatives Wise, Stenholm, and Sprat.  Expedited rescission
would have established
procedures for voting on a President's proposed rescission under
the Impoundment Control Act of
1974, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 688.  As Representative Stenholm put it: 
"[t]he only question is, how much
power do you wish to cede to a President.  That is it."  H.1176. 
Even though 342 Members of
the House had voted for this approach in 1994, H.1171-72, H.1245,
and even though there was
no question as to the constitutionality of expedited rescission,
H.1185, the House twice voted it
down by margins of 167-246, H.1186, and 156-266.  H.1242-56. <p>

     The final amendment, which was adopted without objection,
created a mechanism for
expedited judicial review.  H.1138-39.  It gave standing to Members
of Congress, a hearing
before a three- judge district court in the District of Columbia,
direct appeal to the Supreme
Court, and expedition in both Courts.  The judicial review
amendment was offered by Rep. Deal
of Georgia, a strong supporter of the bill, who noted that "[s]ince
we are proceeding in a statutory
form for a line item veto and not a constitutional amendment, it
should be obvious that until that
constitutionality is clarified, it will be under a cloud."  H.1138. 
In his prepared statement, he
observed that "[h]opefully, the procedure established by my
amendment will result in a final
resolution regarding the constitutionality of line item veto
authority before the fiscal year 1996
appropriation bills are sent to the President."  H.1139.  His
statement further noted that "[i]f my
amendment for judicial review is not added to the bill, it is
unlikely that the courts would consider
the issue until the President exercises the line item authority." 
H.1139.  His position was
supported by Rep. Blute, another proponent, who observed that "this
is a good amendment which
simply ensures that any court challenge to H.R. 2 be considered on
an expedited basis."  <i>Id</i>. 
Congresswoman Collins, an opponent of the bill, also supported this
amendment because it allows
"a test case on this legislation constitutionally without having to
wait for the President to use the
line item veto authority this bill gives him."  H.1139. <p>

     At the end of the lengthy debate, a vote to recommit was
defeated, largely along party lines, by
a vote of 185-241, H.1263, followed by an affirmative vote on final
passage of 294-134. H.1264.<p>

<b>2.  <i>The Senate</b></i><p>

     In the Senate, there were two principal bills.  S. 4, an
"enhanced rescission" bill, was
substantially the same as H.R. 2, except that it did not permit
item veto of tax expenditures. S. 4
required a two-thirds override, allowed the President to reduce as
well as eliminate items of
budgetary authority, and was not limited to items appearing in an
appropriations bill itself.  <i>See</i> S.
Rep. No. 9, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (1995); S. Rep. No. 13, 104th
Cong., 1st Sess. (1995). <p>

     The other vehicle, S. 14, was an "expedited rescission" bill,
similar to the Stenholm, Wise, and
Sprat substitute rejected on the House floor, except that it also
applied to new entitlement and to
tax expenditures.  <i>See</i> S. Rep. No. 10, 104th Cong., 1st
Sess. (1995); S. Rep. No. 14, 104th
Cong., 1st Sess. (1995).  Both bills were referred jointly to the
Committees on Budget and
Governmental Affairs.  On January 18, 1995, the Budget Committee,
Chaired by Sen. Domenici,
held hearings on both bills.  In his opening statement, the
Chairman stated that he preferred S. 14,
and described S. 4 as involving a "maximum shift in power." 
<i>Line-Item Rescission Authority:
Hearings on S. 4 and S. 14 Before The Comm. on the Budget, 104th
Cong., 1st Sess.</i> 2 (1995). 
<i><b>(See Footnote 2)</b></i>  In the words of its sponsors, S. 14
would have "guarantee[d] the President a
vote on his rescission proposals while maintaining the delicate
balance of power between the two
branches on spending authority."  S. Rep. No. 9 at 15 (additional
views of Sen. Domenici).   <p>

     Shortly thereafter, the Subcommittee on the Constitution,
Federalism, and Property Rights of
the Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing to consider two
proposed constitutional
amendments that would create a line item veto, S.J. Res. 2 and S.J.
Res. 16.  <i>See</i> <i>The Line-Item
Veto: A Constitutional Approach: Hearings before the Subcomm. on
the Constitution,
Federalism, and Property Rights of the Comm. on the Judiciary</i>,
104th Cong., 1st Sess (1995). 
<i><b>(See Footnote 3)</b></i>  At that hearing, Senator Biden, who
described himself as a supporter of a
statutory line item veto, opposed a constitutional amendment
because of its permanence, <i>id.</i> at 5,
6, 10, expressed his support for the concept of "separate
enrollment," <i>id.</i> at 10, but strongly urged
his colleagues to insist on a sunset provision.  <i>Id.</i> at
10-11.<p>

     Appearing for the Administration was Assistant Attorney
General Walter Dellinger of the
Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice, who stated
that the President supported a
"strong line-item veto" bill, in particular S. 4.  <i>Id.</i> at
33.  He expressed his opinion that S. 4 is
"clearly constitutional" as "a very strong delegation of authority
to the President . . . not to
expend appropriated funds . . .."  <i>Id.</i> at 34.  He recognized
that the President's cancellation order
"is final and what happens in Congress is that Congress then must
vote a new bill to actually
proceed with that funding, which the President can then veto.  That
is why S. 4 is a two-thirds
bill."  <i>Id.</i>  When asked about the advisability of a
constitutional amendment, he expressed
reservations because of its permanence.  <i>Id.</i> at 35. <p>

        He also stated quite clearly what he thought would
<i>not</i> be constitutional.  Citing what he
called "a long tradition at the Office of Legal Counsel," and
invoking the views of three of his
predecessors in the Reagan and Bush Administrations, he stated that
all of them "have agreed the
President does not at present have that power constitutionally." 
<i>Id.</i> at 36.  He also said that they
all agreed that "Congress cannot literally give the President a
line item veto power by statute, and
that attempts that appear to literally give the President a line
item veto by statute are also
constitutionally invalid."  <i>Id.</i> at 36; <i>see</i>
<i>also</i> <i>id.</i> at 38.  <p>

     On the issue of separate enrollment, he noted that "[a]s much
as I regret saying so," it "also
raises significant constitutional issues" under the Presentment
Clause, or "at a minimum, it raises
such complicated questions under the Presentment Clause that it is
a foolhardy way to proceed
because if we and all our predecessors are right, I think that
which has to be presented to the
House is the thing that passed the House and the Senate and that
which passed the House and
Senate is the bill they voted on final passage, not some little
piece of it or a series of little pieces
of it."  <i>Id.</i> at 38.<p>

     In his prepared statement, Mr. Dellinger explored at greater
length the constitutionality of S. 4. 
While defending "enhanced rescission" on the ground that it was a
lawful delegation to the
President of discretion over spending appropriated funds, he
expressed doubts about the
constitutionality of the provision dealing with targeted tax
benefits because it purports "to
authorize the President to 'veto' targeted tax benefits after they
become law, thus resulting in their
'repeal.'"  <i>Id</i>. at 49.   He then observed that "use of the
terms 'veto' and 'repeal' is constitutionally
problematic [because Article I, Sec. 7 of the Constitution]
provides that the President only can
exercise his 'veto' power before a provision becomes law." 
<i>Id.</i>  He also observed that "the word
'repeal' suggests that the President is being given authorization
to change existing law on his own
[which] arguably would violate the plain textual provisions of
Article I, Section 7 of the
Constitution, governing the manner in which federal laws are to be
made and altered."  <i>Id.</i> <p>

     Mr. Dellinger's method of avoiding these "constitutional
shoals" would be to "recast" S. 4 so
that it "eliminates the word 'veto' from the targeted tax benefit
provision, and confers on the
President the power to <i>suspend</i> (rather than 'repeal') such
benefits."  <i>Id.</i>  These changes would
"preserve the purpose of the provision" and "would place the
targeted tax benefit provision on the
same defensible constitutional footing as the provision regarding
rescission of budget authority." 
<i>Id.</i><p>

     On February 22, 1995, the Senate Budget Committee reported out
S. 4 with amendments, but
without recommendation.  <i>See</i> S. Rep. No. 9, at 13.  The
Committee report makes clear that the
President's rescissions "would remain in effect unless Congress
passed a disapproval bill . . . . and
overcame the President's veto of that disapproval bill," <i>id.</i>
at 1 and that the Committee considered
the authority under S. 4 to be either "rescissions or repeals." 
<i>Id.</i> at 5.  <p>

     The Committee adopted two amendments.  <i>Id.</i> at 8.  The
first, offered by Senator Domenici,
added a sunset date of September 30, 2002 (Sec. 1114), and the
other (Sec. 1113), offered by
Senators Conrad and Snow, established a "lock box" to assure that
any savings from Presidential
rescissions would be devoted to deficit reduction and not spent for
other purposes.  Although he
voted to report out the bill, Sen. Domenici expressed "serious
reservations about S. 4" in his
separate views because he believed that it would "delegate too much
authority to the President
over the control of the budget."  <i>Id.</i> at 14.  He also
expressed his concern that "[o]nly a
Constitutional amendment can give the President the authority to
delete items in spending bills
and the Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over the line item
veto constitutional amendment." 
<i>Id.</i> at 16.  Shortly thereafter, the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee also reported S. 4 as
passed by the Budget Committee, without recommendation and with no
further amendments.  S.
Rep. No. 13, at 6. <p>

     S. 14 was also reported out by both Senate Committees, also
without recommendation.  S.
Rep. No. 10, at 9; S. Rep. No. 14, at 6.  The Committee on the
Budget made some small changes
to the bill as introduced, but under both versions, the President's
proposed rescissions would not
take effect until Congress had affirmatively approved them.  S.
Rep. No. 14, at 7-11; S. Rep. No.
10, at 9.  In addition, S. 14 would also apply to "targeted tax
benefits" which, like in the House's
version, were those limited to 100 or fewer persons.  S. Rep. No.
10, at 14; S. Rep. No. 14, at 11. <p>

     S. 4 then went to the Senate floor where it was considered on
March 16 (S.4074-89); March
17 (S.4125-45); March 20 (S.4153-96); March 21 (S.4212-60); March
22 (S.4295-58) and March
23 (S.4409-87).  Almost immediately, it was announced that the
"enhanced rescission" version of
the line-item veto contained in S. 4, which had been reported out
by both the Budget and
Governmental Affairs Committees, and which was similar to the
House-passed H.R. 2, would not
in fact be the approach that the Senate leadership supported. 
S.4075.  Instead, debate would be
on a "separate enrollment" proposal, on which bills had been
introduced.  S.4075-76. <p>

     The separate enrollment substitute was introduced by Majority
Leader Senator Dole.  S.4188-89.  Under separate enrollment, once
an appropriations bill passed both Houses in agreed upon
form, the enrollment clerks would divide the unified bill into as
many separate bills as there were
separate items of spending, and those separate bills would each be
presented to the President for
his signature.  In addition to the change in the basic form of the
line item veto, the most significant
changes from S. 4, as reported, were the additions of new targeted
tax benefits and new direct
spending, as subjects on which the President could exercise his
line item veto, and the addition of
a sunset date of September 30, 2000.  S.4189.<p>

     Because the Line Item Veto Act ultimately enacted was similar
to the enhanced rescission
version passed by the House in H.R. 2, and not the separate
enrollment substitute, much of the
Senate discussion is no longer relevant.  Nonetheless, despite
these differences, many of the same
issues were raised on the floors of both Houses, generally with the
same result.  Indeed, the
principal Senate sponsor of the line item veto, Sen. McCain,
recognized the essential similarity
between enhanced rescission and separate enrollment.  S.4076.<p>

     The most significant decision in both Houses was whether to
adopt a "strong line item veto"
(in the Senate, separate enrollment, in the House, enhanced
rescission) or to adopt expedited
rescission, essentially the same debate as had occurred in
committee between S. 4 and S. 14, and
had occurred on the House floor.  As Sen. McCain said at the outset
of the Senate floor debate,
"it will boil down to one single issue, have no doubt about it, and
that is whether we would have a
two-thirds vote on the part of both Bodies in order to override the
President's veto--that is what
43 Governors have and that is what the constitutional meaning of
veto is--or whether we will have
a majority vote of one House . . .."  S.4158.  Or, as he put it
earlier, the question "will be, is the
Congress of the United States prepared to transfer significant
power from the legislative branch of
Government to the executive branch of Government for the sake of
the future of our children?"
S.4079. <p>

     Sen. Coats, a co-sponsor with Sen. McCain of a "strong" line
item veto, described the Dole
substitute as one with bipartisan support "that is a real veto
requiring two-thirds of the Congress
to override . . .."  S.4192.  He subsequently referred to the
two-thirds requirement as "the core
concept of line item veto," S.4220, including separate enrollment
as a device that "also can be
described as line item veto . . .."  S.4221.  Similarly, another
supporter of the line item veto, Sen.
Craig, described the two-thirds override as "really at the heart of
all of this." S.4222.  Thus, near
the end of the debate, he observed that the "only material
difference remaining between the Dole
and Daschle [S. 14] versions is whether you want a line item veto
to be overridden by a majority
vote or a [two-thirds] vote."  S.4479.  A substitute "expedited
rescission" alternative, which was
very similar to S. 14, was introduced by Senators Daschle, Exon,
and Glenn, and a motion to
table it passed by a vote of 62-38.  S.4428.       <p>

     Two amendments were adopted on the Senate floor that are of
some significance.  The first,
the so-called Exon "lock box" amendment, S.4259, was agreed to by
consent.  S.4326.  The "lock
box" device ensures that any savings from a Presidential
cancellation are used solely to reduce the
deficit.  Thus, once the congressional review process has
concluded, the administrative and
legislative entities that keep track of the budget make the changes
permanent, thereby preventing
Congress and the President from spending the money on something
else, or from spending the
canceled funds for their appropriated purposes if circumstances
change.<p>

     The second adopted amendment was Sen. Simon's expedited
judicial review provision. 
S.4244.  Like its House counterpart, it provided for Member
standing, a special three-judge court,
direct appeal to the Supreme Court, and expedited consideration in
both Courts.  Sen. McCain
stated that he was "in agreement, except with one caveat," that a
severability clause be added. 
S.4244.  Sen. Simon said that he believed this could be worked out,
and Sen. McCain stated that
he wanted to ensure that if "one minor provision of the Act is
declared unconstitutional, I would
not want the entire Act to be declared unconstitutional."  S.4245. 
Shortly thereafter, the Senate
agreed to the Simon amendment which included a separate
severability provision.  S.4259.<p>

     Part of the willingness of all Members of the Senate to accept
the expedited judicial review
provision was the recognition that, even without the exercise of an
item veto, legislative practices
would change immediately as a result of the President's new power
to wield the item veto.  Sen.
McCain himself, at the opening of the debate, observed that "it
will be very hard to measure the
exact effect of a line item veto, because when a line item veto is
threatened, we will find a
dramatic reduction in the kinds of anecdotal appropriations which
have plagued this body's
reputation with the American people."  S.4076.  Sen. Coats observed
that "it will change the
spending habits of Congress . . . [w]e will never know the amount
of money we save for items
that will not be put in these new bills for fear of exposure. 
Because the President has the line-item
veto, it will change the way we put the bills together in the first
place."  S.4140.  Or, as another
strong line item veto supporter, Sen. Smith, observed, "if we pass
the line item veto, there is
going to be a lot less of the stuff put in the bill in the first
place.  That is for sure."  S.4142.  Sen.
Coats made a similar point later on:<br>

<blockquote> So we will never be able to total up the amount of
money that we have saved for our
constituents and for the taxpayer because the line item veto will
have accomplished its purpose --
its purpose being to prevent this kind of activity from taking
place in the first place; to prevent the
kind of embarrassment that we go through on an annual basis when we
discover the items that
have been slipped into the appropriations bills, slipped into
legislation, slipped into tax bills at the
last minute in conference behind closed doors late at night, and
then presented in a massive bill.</blockquote><br>

S.4221.  Or, as he also noted, the line item veto power "will
fundamentally change the way we
think and behave.  That fundamental change will means that items
which would have been
attached to appropriations bills or would have been incorporated in
the tax bills will not be,
because of the fear that they will be exposed to public scrutiny
before it finally becomes law."  <i>Id.</i> 
<i>See</i> <i>also</i> S.4240 ("My guess is that many will not see
the light of day because those items are
items that we know cannot generate a majority of support, otherwise
they would be brought as
individual items to this floor. . . [o]nly we know in our hearts
and in our minds what items we
might have attached if we had not had line-item veto.").<p>

     Another important theme throughout the Senate floor debate was
that the inclusion of the
authority to item veto limited tax benefits and new items of direct
spending (entitlement) was an
essential element of the ultimate compromise.  S.4125-26 (Stevens);
S.4126 (McCain); S.4127
(Coats); S.4174 (Lott, tax deals); S.4220 (tough negotiations to
bring in the tax and entitlement
aspects); S. 4234 (Coats, describing direct spending and tax
benefits); S.4296 (Santorum,
explaining bill had bipartisan support and reached tax benefits and
entitlement); and S.4420 (Kyl,
emphasizing the importance to Democrats of the tax benefits, lock
box, and sunset provisions). 
<i><b>(See Footnote 4)</b></i><p>

     With more than sixty Senators voting to reject Senator
Daschle's "expedited rescission"
substitute, passage of a separate enrollment bill was assured. 
When the final vote was taken on S.
4 on March 23, 1995, 69 Senators voted in favor and 29 opposed.
S.4484-85. <p>

<b>     3.  <i>The Conference</i></b><p>

     S. 4 was returned to the House where it was considered on the
floor on May 17, 1995. 
H.5090-97.  Rep. Clinger moved to strike the substance of the
Senate bill and replace it with the
House bill so that the matter could then proceed to conference. 
H.5090.  Speaking in support of
his motion, Chairman Clinger referred to the Senate version as a
"weaker bill" and stated that he
expected a "difficult conference" because the House bill "has a
potential constitutional challenge"
whereas the Senate bill "would require the enrollment of thousands
of bills to pass appropriations
in discrete line items requiring thousands of signatures and
guaranteeing future Presidents an
amazing case of writer's cramps as they deal with this as well as
creating some significant amount
of paperwork."  H.5091.  His motion was agreed to without a
recorded vote.  H.5094.<p>

     On March 21, 1996, nearly a year after both Houses had passed
a line item veto bill, the
Conference reached agreement.  <i>See</i> Line Item Veto Act, H.R.
Conf. Rep. 104-491, 104th Cong.,
2d Sess. (1996) (hereafter "Conf. Rep.").  Other than using the
bill number S. 4 as the vehicle, the
conference version bore no relation to the Senate-passed bill, but
was quite similar to H.R. 2 as
passed by the House.<p>

     First, the chosen version of the line item veto was not
separate enrollment but enhanced
rescission.  The law's full title is "An Act to give the President
line item veto authority with
respect to appropriations, new direct spending, and limited tax
benefits."  Conf. Rep. at 14.  The
President's item veto power is triggered when a bill or resolution
"has been signed into law
pursuant to Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution."  Section
2(a) (adding ICA Sec. 1021(a)). 
<i><b>(See Footnote 5)</i>  </b>The Conferees also reduced to five
days the time in which the President could
exercise his veto authority after signing.  <i>Id.</i>  <p>

     The Conferees explained that they "specifically include[d] the
requirement that a bill or joint
resolution must have been signed into law in order to clarify that
the cancellation authority only
becomes effective after the President has exercised the
constitutional authority to enact legislation
in its entirety.  This requirement ensures that the President
affirmatively demonstrates support for
the underlying legislation from which the specific cancellations
are then permitted."  Conf. Rep. at
20.  The Conferees intended that the cancellations would occur "as
soon as possible" and
provided a "maximum time" of five days only "to ensure that all
supporting material required for
inclusion in the special message can be provided by the
Administration."  <i>Id.</i> at 22.       The
President is given authority to "cancel" in whole any dollar amount
of discretionary budget
authority, any item of new direct spending, or any limited tax
benefit.  Section 2(a) (adding ICA
Sec. 1021(a)(1)-(3)).  The terms "cancel" or "cancellation" are
defined in section 1026(4).  With
respect to discretionary budget authority, "cancel" is defined to
mean "rescind."  <i>Id.</i> (adding ICA
Sec. 1026(4)(A)).  With regard to items of new direct spending,
such as new entitlement or
increases in existing entitlement, the term "cancellation" means
"to prevent [the item] from having
legal force or effect."  <i>Id.</i> (adding ICA Sec. 1026(4)(B)). 
<i><b>(See Footnote 6)</i>  </b>Similarly, with
respect to limited tax benefits, cancellation prevents "the
specific provision of law that provides
such benefit from having legal force or effect."  <i>Id.</i>
(adding ICA Sec. 1026(4)(C)).  The
Conference Report states, "[t]he term 'cancel' was specifically
chosen, and is carefully defined in
section 1026.  The conferees intend that the President may use the
cancellation authority <i>to
surgically terminate federal budget obligations.</i>"  Conf. Rep.
at 20 (emphasis added).  In contrast
to the House bill, which allowed the President to reduce as well as
to eliminate items, the final
version limits the power of the President to cancel items "in
whole."  <i>Id.</i> (adding ICA Secs.
1021(a), 1026(7)).  To further clarify that a cancellation of
budget authority terminates the
spending authority, the Act adopts a "lock box" procedure so that
the "savings" cannot be used
for a subsequent appropriation or direct spending measure or tax
benefits.  <i>See</i> Section 2(a)
(adding ICA Sec. 1024).   <p>

     Like the versions that passed both Houses, the President's
authority is not limited to items
specified in the legislation itself.  The veto power reaches not
only the "entire dollar of budget
authority" that is "specified in an appropriation law" but also
amounts "required to be allocated by
a specific proviso in an appropriation law for which a specific
dollar figure was not included."  <i>Id.</i>
(adding ICA Sec. 1026(7)(A)(i)).  The cancellation authority also
extends to amounts
"represented separately in any table, chart or explanatory text
included in the statement of
managers or the governing committee report accompanying such law." 
<i>Id.</i> (adding ICA Sec.
1026(7)(A)(ii)).  <i><b>(See Footnote 7)</i>  </b>An example in the
Conference Report--referring to use of a
table accompanying a Conference Report--illustrates the kind of
legislative materials the President
may use in exercising the item veto.  Conf. Rep. at 22-23.  The
President, however, "cannot use
this authority to modify or alter any aspect of the underlying law,
including any restriction,
limitation or condition on the expenditure of budget authority, or
any other requirement of law." 
<i>Id.</i> at 20.  <p>

     Line item veto of "limited tax benefits" remains basically as
it was enacted in both Houses. 
"Limited tax benefits" are "any revenue-losing provision" that
provides a "deduction, credit,
exclusion, or preference" to 100 or fewer taxpayers during any
fiscal year that the rule is in effect,
unless it is a transition provision, in which case the number of
taxpayers is 10 or fewer.  Section
2(a) (adding ICA Sec. 1026(9)).  One significant addition in the
Conference was a process for
identification of limited tax benefits.  Under a new provision, if
either the bill itself identifies a
provision as a limited tax benefit, or the Joint Committee on
Taxation does so, those are the
exclusive provisions that the President may cancel.  <i>Id.</i>
(adding ICA Sec. 1027)).  If neither of
these sources identifies any such benefits, however, then the
President may use the definitions
under section 2(a) of the Act (adding ICA Sec. 1026) to select
benefits to be canceled.  Finally,
the Act precludes judicial review of Congressional identifications
of a limited tax benefit.  <i>Id.</i> 
(adding ICA Sec. 1027(d)). <p>

     Under the Conference bill, the procedures to be followed for
the President to exercise a line
item veto are basically the same as in the earlier enhanced
rescission versions.  As a prerequisite to
issuing a cancellation order, the President must determine only
that the cancellation will "(i)
reduce the federal budget deficit, (ii) not impair any essential
Government functions, and, (iii) not
harm the national interest."  <i>Id.</i> (adding ICA Sec.
1021(a)(3)(A)).  The President must send a
single cancellation message for all items he wishes to cancel in
each law.  <i>Id.</i> (adding ICA
Sec. 1022(a)).  He has five calendar days, excluding Sundays, to
submit his message after
enactment.  <i>Id.</i> (adding ICA Sec. 1021(a)(3)(B)).<p>

     The cancellation order is effective immediately upon receipt
in the Congress.  <i>Id.</i> (adding ICA
Sec. 1023(a)).  As the Conference Report stated:
<br>
<blockquote>Upon receipt of the President's special message in both
the House of Representatives and the
Senate each [item] identified in the special message is immediately
canceled.  The cancellation of a
dollar amount of discretionary budget authority automatically
rescinds the funds.  With respect to
an item of new direct spending or a limited tax benefit, the
cancellation renders the provision void,
such that the obligation of the United States has no legal force or
effect. </blockquote>
<br>
Conf. Rep. at 22.  The Report also noted that the cancellation "is
nullified only if a disapproval bill
is enacted into law [in which case the] effective date for any
cancellation . . . is the original date
provided in the law to which the cancellation applied."  <i>Id.</i> 
Finally, even if Congress has
insufficient time to act before adjourning sine die, the
cancellation continues in effect, and the
disapproval period is started again in the next Congress.  Section
2(a) (adding ICA Sec.
1025(b)(3)).<p>

     The Act provides for expedited congressional consideration of
a disapproval bill.  <i>Id.</i> (adding
ICA Sec. 1025).  No Congressional approval is needed to make the
President's cancellation
effective.  Conf. Rep. at 22.  In essence, Congress has 30 calendar
days of session after receipt,
although in the Senate, if the process is underway when the 30 days
expire, the expedition rules
continue to apply.  In the House all items in the President's
cancellation message must be included
in a disapproval resolution, a limit that does not apply in the
Senate.  Section 2(a) (adding ICA
Sec. 1025(c)(2)).  The relevant House committee is given seven days
to report the bill without
amendment, and the only floor amendments that are in order are
those to strike a cancellation
item, which require the sponsorship of at least 50 Members. 
<i>Id.</i> (adding Sec. 1025(d)).  In the
Senate, additions or deletions of particular items are in order,
and there is no minimum number of
Senators required.  <i>Id.</i> (adding Sec. 1025(B)(4)).  After the
expiration of the 30 days for
expedited consideration, unless there is a disapproval bill enacted
within 10 calendar days, the
cancellation is permanent. <i>Id.</i> (adding ICA Secs.
1024(b)-(c)).<p>

     The Conferees also included a judicial review provision,
<i>see</i> section 3, 110 Stat. 1211 (codified
at 2 U.S.C. Sec. 692), although they deleted the requirement for a
three-judge court that was in
both the Senate and House bills.  There is no explanation in the
Conference Report for this
change, but it appears to have been prompted by a letter from then
Director of the Office of
Management and Budget, Alice Rivlin, stating the Administration's
opposition to three-judge
courts (copy attached).  Two other changes of note occurred in this
provision:  it was expanded
to cover "any individual adversely affected by [this Act]," and the
severability provision added in
the Senate was deleted.  Section 3.<p>

     The Conferees agreed that the bill would be made effective on
the earlier of the enactment of
"a seven-year plan for deficit reduction [and to] achieve a
balanced Federal budget," or January 1,
1997.  Section 5.  And while the sunset provision that the Senate
had insisted upon was included,
the sunset date was extended until January 1, 2005, giving the Act
a life of eight rather than five
years.  <i>Id.</i> <p>

     Not surprisingly, once agreement had been reached, the floor
debates on March 27 and March
28, 1996, primarily explained what had already taken place. 
S.2929-95 and H.2971-3028.  For
example, in his opening statement, Senator McCain described the
President's "cancellation
authority" as the power "to surgically eliminate Federal budget
obligations," which "automatically
rescinds the [discretionary budget] funds;" and for an item of new
direct spending or a limited tax
benefit, he observed "the cancellation renders the provision void,
such that the obligation of the
United States has no legal force or effect."  S.2930.<p>

     Senator Stevens, an earlier doubter but an eventual convert,
described the bill as "the most
significant delegation of authority by the Congress to the
President since the Constitution was
ratified in 1789 . . . It is a major, major, change in the policy
of the Congress toward the executive
branch."  S.2955.  He further called the veto "a major change in
the balance of Government
power.  It is really a check on the check of the checks and
balances."  S. 2957.  Other major
supporters of S. 4 echoed the same theme.  Senator Gramm said that
there is "no doubt about it --
and the distinguished Senator from West Virginia [line item veto
opponent and plaintiff Senator
Byrd] is right -- it changes the balance of power between the
Congress and the President in one
fundamental way:  It gives the President enhanced power to say 'no'
to spending."  S.2960. 
Another strong supporter, Senator Kyl, made a similar point: "Make
no mistake about it, this bill
will shift a great deal of new power to the President."  S.2978.<p>

     One last effort was made to stop the bill on the Senate floor. 
Senator Byrd moved to
recommit the Conference Report with instructions to substitute S.
14 in its place.  S.2949.  The
motion was tabled by a vote of 58 to 42, and the bill passed 69-31.
S.2995.<p>

     The proceedings on the House floor also produced an
unsuccessful attempt to recommit,
H.3024-25, which failed by a vote of 192-228, followed by a final
passage of 328 to 91.  H.3028. 
On April 9, 1996, President Clinton signed the Line Item Veto Act
of 1996.  <i>See</i> Public Law 104-130, 110 Stat. 1200 (1996).<p>

<b>2</b>   Those hearings were a follow-up to a hearing held on
October 5, 1994, in the 103rd Congress. 
The record of that hearing assembles much of the prior legislative
material relating to efforts to create a line item veto, either
by statute or constitutional amendment.  <i>See</i> <i>Legislative

also offered an amendment, narrower
than the one offered in the House, to exempt certain functions of
the Judiciary, not including

<p>
<b>6</b>   "Direct spending" is defined to mean "(A) budget
authority provided by a law (other than an
appropriation law, (b) entitlement authority; and (c) the food
stamp program."  Section 2(a)
(adding ICA Sec. 1026(5)).  An "item of new direct spending" means
"any specific provision of
law that is estimated to result in an increase in budget authority
or outlays for direct spending
relative to the most recent levels calculated pursuant to section
257 of the Balanced Budget and
Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985." <i>Id.</i> (adding ICA Sec.
1026(8)).  To be subject to the
President's cancellation power, legislation providing for direct
spending need not result "in a net
increase" in spending, as "[a] provision of a future law that
increases direct spending would be
subject to the President's cancellation authority whether or not it
is offset by another provision
that reduces direct spending or increases revenues in the same
law."  Conf. Rep. at 36.

<p>

The Editor<p>

The Journal of Commerce<p>

Two World Trade Center<p>

27th Floor<p>

N.Y. N.Y. 10048<p>

							August 15, 1996<p>

<p>

Dear Editor:<p>

<p>

Your recent editorial on the World Trade Organization (<i>The WTO at Work </i>8/15/96) shows a
fundamental lack of understanding about the enforcement power of this global bureaucracy.<p>

<p>

You claim that "The WTO has no police or army to enforce its rulings. It relies solely on the
good will of its member countries."  This may have been true prior to the Uruguay Round when a
consensus of member nations was required to adopt sanctions. For example, when the United
States ban on the sale of tuna caught using dolphin deadly purse seine nets was found to violate
GATT rules, the U.S. was able to block the ruling. <p>

<p>

Under the WTO however, a consensus of all nations is required to <i>block</i> rulings from taking
effect. WTO rulings must be implemented or automatic trade sanctions go into effect, also stop
able only by unanimous consent. This meant that when the WTO's very first ruling was against
U.S. Clean Air Act rules, the United States had three choices: change the regulation, face $150
million in trade sanctions or negotiate $150 million in compensation. When faced with this no-win situation, it is disappointing but not surprising that the United States Trade Representative's
office has announced it will change the Clean Air Act regulation which protects public health. .<p>

<p>

It is only because the WTO now has enforcement power that the Clinton Administration and the
Republican leadership are attempting to gut the U.S. dolphin protection standard which the U.S.
had safeguarded from the old GATT.  Mexico has threatened to take the highly successful
dolphin protection law to the WTO.  To avoid the high-profile embarrassment of "GATTzilla
eating Flipper for lunch" at the WTO, the Clinton Administration is pushing for a pre-emptive
capitulation. <p>

<p>

This power of the WTO to force governments to change environmental, health and labor
standards in order to avoid trade sanction is already wreaking havoc on democratically achieved
safeguards across the globe.<p>

<p>

							Sincerely,<p>

							Lori Wallach<p>

							Director, Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch<p>

<h1>
<b>CONGRESS WATCH'S PRIORITY ISSUES FOR THE 105TH CONGRESS</h1></b><p>

<p>

Public Citizen is a non-profit research, lobbying and litigation organization founded by Ralph
Nader in 1971.  Congress Watch is a principal lobbying arm of Public Citizen and has the
following priorities for the 105th Congress:<b><p>

<u><p>

<a href="/congress/reform/home.html"><center>Campaign Finance 
Reform</center></a></u></b><p>

<p>

	The current campaign finance system is a scandal.  Monied interests control the legislative
agenda of the Congress because they control the purse strings of the campaigns.  Only the rich, or
the friends of the rich, can afford to run for office.  Incumbents accumulate massive war chests to
scare off potential challengers merely be holding out their hands at fundraisers attended by PACs
and lobbyists.  The public is outraged by this system and frustrated with Congress's failure to
change it.  <p>

<p>

	Parties and candidates spent nearly $2 billion on the 1996 elections, the most ever.   Outside
groups spent hundreds of millions more on independent expenditures and so-called issue
advocacy.  Tales of fundraising scandals and abuses were daily occurrences during the last few
months of the campaign, and investigations and recriminations will likely occupy the Congress
for months to come.  And for what?  The end result of this spending orgy was an election in
which less than half of the eligible electorate turned out to vote, and 95% of incumbent members
of the House (and all but one Senator) who sought reelection were successful.  <p>

<p>

	Public Citizen has long been committed to bringing about meaningful campaign finance reform,
and we will play a leading role in pushing for a major overhaul in the 105th Congress.  Such
reform should include a cap on spending in exchange for significant public resources, a ban on
soft money, and reductions in the influence of special interest PACs.  Unlimited party spending
and electioneering disguised as issue advocacy also must be addressed.  Congress must also
improve disclosure of campaign funding and enforcement of the election laws, which includes
providing adequate resources for the FEC to do its job. <p>

<b><u><p><center><a href="/congress/corwel/home.html">

Corporate Welfare</u></b></a></center><p>

<p>

	Each year, U.S. taxpayers subsidize U.S. businesses to the tune of more than $150 billion. Every
five years, the U.S. Treasury loses $1 billion because mining companies don't pay a fair market
value for minerals extracted from public lands. Companies such as Hershey International and
McDonalds receive some $69 million each year in public funds for advertising campaigns and
other promotions of their products as American agricultural exports.  Stopping public funding of
new roads in the national forests, which are used by timber companies to carry away trees they
bought from the government for next to nothing, would save about $50 million annually.  <p>

<p>

	Each dollar spent on these "aid for dependent corporation" welfare programs means one dollar
less for environmental programs, support for education, assistance to those in need, tax <p>

breaks for families, or deficit reduction.  During this Congress, Public Citizen will help lead a
major  push to reduce corporate welfare. Key votes will likely occur in the spring, when the <p>

budget is debated, and then in the summer and fall as specific appropriations bills, ladened with
corporate pork, are considered.<p>

<u><b><p><center><a href="/congress/fda/home.html">

Regulatory Roll Back</b></u></a></center><p>

<p>

	Today, Americans enjoy safer automobiles and consumer products, purer food and drinking
water, cleaner air, more reliable drugs and medical devices, and safer work places than ever
before.  These safeguards were under attack in the 104th Congress, and we expect a similar
assault on these important protections in the 105th Congress.           <p>

<p>

	Pro-industry Members of Congress want to cripple government agencies such as the EPA, the
FDA, and OSHA --  each charged with protecting the health and safety of the American public. 
Anti-regulatory extremists have a three-pronged approach to rolling back important health and
safety standards: 1) Paralyze regulatory agencies by requiring needless and excessively
bureaucratic procedures -- such as extensive cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments -- before
a simple standard to implement environmental, health and safety laws could be issued.  2) Attack
actual laws that guarantee health and safety protections.  At various times over the last two years,
serious attempts to roll back the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water
Act, the Food, Drugs and Cosmetics Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act all came up
for consideration.  3) De-fund important agencies and programs that ensure health and safety.<p>

<p>

	Anti-safety leaders and their special interest allies were thwarted in the 104th Congress, but they
are likely to be back with a vengeance in 1997-1998.  One probable bill will neutralize important
FDA protections.  Another may make a broader attack on all environmental, health and safety
laws.  Public Citizen is prepared to again take the lead to make sure that critical health and safety
standards are not rolled back.<p>

<p>

 <u><b><center><a href="/congress/civjus/home.html">Civil Justice 
Issues</a></center></b></u><p>

<p>

	For over 100 years, Americans injured by defective products, unsafe workplaces and medical
malpractice have had the right to seek compensation in courts of law before citizen juries.
America's civil justice system has been responsible for punishing corporations that  manufacture
defective products -- such as the Ford Pinto, school buses, asbestos, tobacco and the Dalkon
Shield -- and holding HMOs, hospitals and doctors accountable for reckless medical care.  Public
Citizen believes that Americans have a right to a trial by jury when they are injured by defective
products or negligent health care. <p>

<p>

	Because it has been a successful deterrent of corporate misconduct, in the last 15 years,
America's civil justice system has been under ferocious attack in Congress and state legislatures
by HMOs and doctors, insurance companies, oil and chemical polluters, big tobacco and auto
manufacturers seeking immunity for wrongdoing. Although corporations have been successful in
securing some limitations on liability in individual states, Public Citizen and other consumer
groups have stopped Congress from enacting federal limits on corporate liability.<p>

	But each year, the attack on the right to trial by jury intensifies. Last year, the bill actually passed
Congress but was stopped from becoming law by President Clinton's veto. In 1997, Public
Citizen will once again lead the effort to oppose another well-funded corporate effort to limit the
liability of reckless corporations and doctors. Votes will likely take place in the House <p>

and Senate during the Spring of 1997.  In addition to limitations on liability for defective
products and medical malpractice, key votes will likely occur on limiting the liability of railroads
and shipping companies. <p>

<b><u><p><center><a href"/congress/health/home.html">

Health Care Reform</u></b></center></a><p>

<p>

	One hundred forty-million Americans now get their health coverage through some form of
managed care. There has been an explosion of big business, profit-making managed care
companies that often put profits ahead of patient care. Some managed care companies have
included "gag rules" in their contracts with participating physicians, preventing them from fully
discussing treatment options with patients.  Many have financial incentives which reward doctors
for referring fewer patients to specialists.  Often decisions on what treatments will be authorized
are made by persons who have not examined the patients -- they may not even be fully qualified
medical professionals.  <p>

<p>

	Only a few states have adopted comprehensive measures to stop managed care abuses.  Many
Americans whose health care comes from self-insured, employer-sponsored managed care plans
are not protected by any state legislation because current federal law forbids states from
regulating such plans.	<p>

									  <p>

	Public Citizen continues to believe that fundamental health care reform that provides quality
universal care will only come when the U.S. adopts a single-payer system similar to Canada's. 
However, to protect those Americans who find themselves in managed care from abuses which
may threaten their health, Public Citizen is working for passage of federal legislation to provide
comprehensive, effective regulation of managed care and for a change in federal law to ensure
that states are able to protect the rights of all managed care enrollees within their state. <p>

		HOUSE SHOULD NOT RE-ELECT GINGRICH
		BEFORE COMPLETING ETHICS PROCESS
	</h2>
<p>
	<h3>
		Public Release of Documents and Gingrich Sworn Testimony Essential
	</h3>
<p>
</center>
Public Citizen today called on the House not to re-elect Speaker Newt Gingrich before the Ethics Committee and the full House has meted out punishment for the ethical violations the Speaker admitted last month.  In a letter to every Member of the House, P

ublic Citizen President Joan Claybrook said: "The Speaker of the House is a constitutional office with enormous power and responsibility, second in the line of presidential succession. . . .It would be unconscionable for the House to elect Mr. Gingrich to

 this position while he faces a possibly serious ethics sanction."  Claybrook suggested that the Republicans should elect an acting Speaker on January 7 if they wish to leave open the possibility of re-electing Speaker Gingrich after the ethics proceeding

 is completed.<p>

Claybrook also asked the House to ensure that all relevant documents on the Gingrich matter are released to the public and that Speaker Gingrich testify under oath before the Ethics Committee prior to final House action on the case.  According to Claybroo

k, "these steps will assure the public that the serious charges to which the Speaker has admitted are not being swept aside in a partisan power play."   She stated that the public must have "accurate, complete, and reliable information," which Speaker Gin

grich has admitted he did not provide to the Ethics Committee, in order to hold the Speaker and the Congress accountable for their actions.<p>

Claybrook said that extensive public hearings and sworn testimony from Speaker Gingrich are essential because of questions raised by the Speaker's admission of unethical actions.  In particular, she expressed skepticism over the Speaker's assertion that h

e never requested legal advice about the use of non-profit organizations to fund his political activities:  "The need to keep tax exempt activities and partisan politics separate is almost as well known as the separation between church and state.  This is

 not an arcane' concept."<p>

Claybrook also noted that public hearings would allow the House and public to evaluate Speaker Gingrich's explanation that his lawyers were responsible for submitting false statements to the Ethics Committee.  Claybrook told the House:  "This explanation 

rings hollow.  In light of the number and specificity of the instances cited by the Subcommittee, the misrepresentations appear intentional."<p>

<h3>
SPEAKER GINGRICH SHOULD NOT BE RE-ELECTED UNTIL AFTER THE HOUSE COMPLETES 
WORK ON THE ETHICS VIOLATIONS HE HAS ADMITTED </h3>
</center>

January 2, 1997<P>

Dear Member of the House of Representatives:<P>

The ethics violations to which Speaker Gingrich has admitted, as outlined in the Statement of the Investigative Subcommittee of the House Ethics Committee of December 21, 1996,  are serious.  Unfortunately, in an exercise of partisan spin control, certain
 Members of  the House and commentators in the press have minimized and distorted the findings of the Subcommittee.  Many even called for the punishment phase of this proceeding, which follows an investigation that lasted over two years, to be completed w
ithin two weeks so that the Speaker can be re-elected on January 7 without the cloud of an uncertain ethics sanction hanging over his head.<p>

Such an action would have seriously compromised the integrity of the proceeding and diminished public confidence in Congress.   Fortunately, the Ethics Committee has decided not to rush to judgment.  It has announced that it will begin the punishment phas
e on January 8, and will hold some type of public hearing before announcing a decision. <b><i>We strongly believe that Speaker Gingrich should not be re-elected until after the House has acted on the ethics case.</i></b>  Furthermore, prior to taking fina
l action, the House should ensure that all relevant documents in the case have been made available to the public and should insist that the Speaker testify under oath before the Ethics Committee in public session.  As discussed below, these steps will ass
ure the public that the serious charges to which the Speaker has admitted are not being swept aside in a partisan power play:  <p>

<b>1.  The House should not reelect Speaker Gingrich until after the Ethics Committee has completed its work and the House has voted on the sanction for the Speaker's ethical transgressions.</b>  The Speaker of the House is a constitutional office with en
ormous power and responsibility, second in the line of presidential succession.  While the office is often filled through a partisan vote, both parties have the duty to demand that the highest standards of ethics and integrity are maintained by the person
 who assumes the post.  It would be unconscionable for the House to elect Mr. Gingrich to this position while he faces a possibly serious ethics sanction.  If the Republicans, who control the House, wish to leave open the possibility of reelecting Speaker
 Gingrich after this proceeding is completed, they should elect a temporary or acting Speaker on January 7.<p>

<b>2.  All documents relevant to the Subcommittee's work should be made public. </b> This includes the report of Special Counsel James Cole and any written opinion or other work product of the tax counsel retained by the Subcommittee.  In addition, transc
ripts of the testimony of the Subcommittee's tax counsel and the tax counsel who appeared on behalf of Speaker Gingrich before the Subcommittee should be released along with all written submissions from Speaker Gingrich's counsel and tax experts.  Now tha
t Speaker Gingrich has admitted ethical violations in this case, there is simply no justification for keeping the results of the investigation secret.  The public has the right to review all relevant evidence against Speaker Gingrich in order to be able t
o inform its elected representatives of its views prior to the House making a final decision on sanctions for the Speaker and his possible re-election.  <p>

<b>3.  The House Ethics Committee's public hearing should include sworn testimony from Speaker Gingrich.</b>   The Committee has announced only that it will hear from Special Counsel Cole in the public hearing.  We believe it is essential that the Speaker
, and perhaps his counsel, testify as well.   After over two years of working behind closed doors, the Committee owes the public a complete opportunity to evaluate these matters before resolving them, particularly because the Subcommittee's Statement and 
the Speaker's response to it raise a number of unanswered questions.   <p>

Mr. Gingrich admitted that he should have sought legal advice about the use of two charitable foundations for a variety of politically oriented projects in which Mr. Gingrich was involved. It is elementary that charitable organizations cannot engage in pa
rtisan political activity.  The need to keep tax exempt activities and partisan politics separate is almost as well known as the separation between church and state.  This is not an arcane' concept, as some have claimed. Anyone who holds political office
 and is therefore conversant with federal election law must have at least some familiarity with this basic restriction on charitable organizations.<p>

If  Mr. Gingrich truly did not seek legal advice on these matters -- and a recent news report from the <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i> on legal memos written by two attorneys who worked for GOPAC and the Progress & Freedom Foundation cast doubt on tha
t assertion -- then the failure to consult counsel may very well have been willful, not an oversight.  (See attached article.)  Before determining the appropriate sanction for the conduct to which the Speaker has admitted, the Ethics Committee must be sat
isfied that the admission is complete and truthful.  It should explore those questions in the public hearing and call on the Speaker to testify under oath.<p>

Also extremely troubling is the Speaker's admission that certain information submitted to the Committee on his behalf was "inaccurate, incomplete, and unreliable."  The Subcommittee cites thirteen separate "inaccurate" statements by Mr. Gingrich concernin
g the involvement of GOPAC in his college course. (See pages 20 and 21 of the Subcommittee's Statement of December 21, 1996).   These were not minor, inconsequential statements.  They went to the very heart of the Committee's inquiry -- whether the colleg
e course was political in nature and therefore inappropriate for funding by charitable foundations.  Mr. Gingrich repeatedly denied that GOPAC was involved in planning, designing, or administering the course, both in submissions to the Committee and in pu
blic statements for many years.  But the Subcommittee amassed substantial evidence known to the Speaker that the course was an integral part of GOPAC's activities in support of Republican candidates.  <p>

Mr. Gingrich and his defenders on Capitol Hill have suggested on numerous occasions that his lawyers bear responsibility for submitting inaccurate information to the Committee.  This explanation rings hollow.  In light of the number and specificity of the
 instances cited by the Subcommittee, the misrepresentations appear intentional.  Again, the Speaker's admission raises more questions than it answers, making the need for the Committee to hold a public hearing before recommending a sanction all the more 
apparent.<p>

<b><i>The charges against Speaker Gingrich are not a partisan squabble to be resolved through a party line power play.  They go to the heart of the integrity of the political process and the ethics process by which the Congress oversees the conduct of its
 Members.  The public is entitled to hold the Speaker and the Congress accountable for its actions.  It must have "accurate, complete, and reliable information" in order to do so.</i></b><p>

Thank you for your consideration.<p>

						Sincerely,
<p>
<p>

						Joan Claybrook
						President

<h2><center>Tuna/Dolphin Sign On Letter, February 7,
1996</h2></center><p>

<p>

Dear Congressman Miller:<p>

<p>

	<u>We the undersigned join the millions of
American fishers, consumers, and
environmentalists who support H.R. 2856,
the International Dolphin Protection and
Consumer Information Act of 1996.</u>  We
believe that your efforts, and those of
Senators Barbara Boxer and Joseph
Biden, to safeguard dolphin populations
against the GATT-imposed weakening of
the Marine Mammal Protection Act are a
rallying point for all congress members
who are concerned about the integrity of
U.S. laws in the age of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), the successor to the
GATT.<p>

<p>

	When Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo
visited Washington this past fall, the
Clinton Administration pledged that it
would repeal our historic dolphin
protection law by the end of January
1996! There is no GATT legal
requirement for the U.S. to repeal our law
now. Still, the Clinton Administration
agreed to repeal it because the inability to
get Congress to voluntarily comply with
the GATT panel is viewed as an
embarrassment to the Administration's
GATT/WTO Geneva mission.<p>

<p>

	You have undoubtedly received letters
from many environmental groups
concerned with dolphin conservation; and
thus you should be aware that the vast
majority of national, state and local
environmental and conservation groups
support the Boxer/Biden/Miller
legislation. The support of the members of
the Citizens Trade Campaign -- and our
strong opposition to H.R. 2823, the House
version of the Breaux/Stevens bill to
change the definition of "dolphin safe" --
focusses on two additional matters:<p>

<p>

1. 	<u>Setting a Bad GATT/WTO Precedent:
Congress Quickly and Quietly Kills
Democratically-Achieved U.S. Laws If the
GATT/WTO Opposes It.</u> <p>

<p>

	Even if your colleagues do not care about
this dolphin law, their actions with this
case will set the precedent for future
GATT/WTO rulings declaring that we
can no longer maintain our
democratically-achieved laws. America's
ability to set its own laws and control the
terms of access to its own consumer
markets are at stake. In its hearings and
debate on this environmental issue the
Congress must consider: <i>What law will be
attacked next?</i>  The European Union has
listed many U.S. defense, procurement,
and product standard laws as
GATT/WTO illegal. If Congress passes
the Steven-Breaux bill to gut the Marine
Mammal Protection Act, a long-standing,
court-tested and popularly-supported
measure, the Congress will have proved
what the bureaucrats at the GATT/WTO
already are saying: <i>GATT/World Trade
Organization rules take precedence over
U.S. law.</i> Support for the International
Dolphin Protection and Consumer
Information Act of 1996 is support for the
integrity of American democratic decision
making over "harmonized" international
trade rules.<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

2. 	<u>U.S. Consumer Fraud</u><p>

<p>

	Unlike the Boxer/Biden/Miller legislation,
the Stevens-Breaux bill would allow tuna
to come into the U.S. and be labelled
"dolphin safe" even though it was caught
with techniques that would further harm
severely depleted dolphin populations.
The Act was passed after a massive public
campaign in which millions of school
children and ultimately all of the major
U.S. tuna companies pressured Congress
to stop the sale of dolphin-deadly tuna.
The tuna companies still support the
Marine Mammal Protection Act because
U.S. consumers demand dolphin safe
tuna. Under the current law, which your
bill respects and strengthens, the
companies know that no competitor can
sell tuna labelled "dolphin safe" if it is
not. The good news is that it is not
necessary to break faith with all of
America's school children and their
parents -- which is another reason for
your colleagues to publicly support and
co-sponsor the International Dolphin
Protection and Consumer Information
Act.<p>

<p>

Sincerely,<p>

<h3><center>April 30, 1996</h3></center>

<p>

<p>

	Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, on behalf of Public
Citizen and its members nationwide, thank you for the opportunity
to testify on the two bills, S. 1429 (Stevens-Breaux) and S. 1460
(Boxer-Biden,) before Congress which would alter the U.S. Marine
Mammal Protection Act (MMPA,) a long standing U.S. environmental
law that was successfully challenged in 1991 and 1993 as an
illegal trade barrier at the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT.)<p>

<p>

	 My name is Lori Wallach. I am the director of Public Citizen's
Global Trade Watch. Public Citizen is a consumer advocacy group
founded in 1974 by Ralph Nader. My testimony today is also
endorsed by the Citizens Trade Campaign of which Public Citizen
is a member group along with hundreds of other consumer, labor,
religious, environmental, family farm and other citizens groups
across the country. The combined membership of the Citizens Trade
Campaign member organizations is over 7 million nationwide. Both
the Citizens Trade Campaign and Public Citizen are members of the
Fair Trade Dolphin Safe Campaign. Please allow me to set the
record straight as to the position of labor unions on these
bills. The union members of the Citizens Trade campaign,
including Teamsters, UNITE!, IUE, and OCAW and their millions of
members nationwide support the Boxer-Biden bill and oppose the
Stevens-Breaux bill and are signatories to a recent letter
stating that position. The AFL-CIO takes no position on either
bill. <p>

<p>

	Congress' decision to change U.S. policies relating to the
protection of dolphins in tuna fishing undoubtedly has
significant environmental and conservation consequences and these
issues have gotten a significant amount of attention in the
Congress. My only comment in this area is not as a marine
biologist, but as an American citizen who cares about protecting
dolphins and who eats tuna fish. I have been struck that it does
not seem like a very good idea to change a policy that according
to the preambles of both proposed bills, has been remarkably
successful in meeting it conservation goal. This is more so the
case when there is such a significant split in the environmental
community as to whether either of these proposed changes actually
would undermine the successful dolphin conservation status quo.<p>

<p>

	My area of expertise is trade. From my perspective, the key issue
with these two bills amending the MMPA is their enormous
implications on U.S. international trade policy. <p>

<p>

	The MMPA was the first well-known, widely-supported piece of U.S.
environmental legislation successfully attacked at the GATT.<a 
href="#[1]"><b><u>[1]</u></b></a>
In that 1991 ruling, the GATT declared the sovereign right of the
U.S. Congress to set the conditions for a product's access to the
U.S. domestic market to be trumped by international trade
obligations under GATT. The United States was ordered to
eliminate the core provisions of our existing dolphin protection
law, the MMPA, that set domestic standards for tuna sold in this
market and enforced those standards as a condition of market
access. Under old GATT rules, the United States was able to block
the ruling instead of implementing it at the time. This was a
fortunate emergency brake for the Bush Administration, because
the 1991 GATT ruling set off a public furor. This case made GATT
known to the American public. Written about in Newsweek, the New
York Times and other national publications as the case of
"GATTzilla versus Flipper," it was this real life example that
brought home the threat that seemed inconceivable: an
unaccountable bureaucracy in another country telling the U.S.
Congress to kill a U.S. domestic law or pay sanctions to maintain
it. <p>

<p>

	Now, once again, GATTzilla vs. Flipper is back in play. <p>

<p>

1. Congressional MMPA Debate Is Viewed Worldwide as a Trade, Not
Environmental Issue.<p>

<p>

	To most of the world, this current U.S. debate about our dolphin
policy is viewed not as an environmental issue, but as a debate
about trade. Speaking to officials at the Geneva-based World
Trade Organization and in the trade offices of other governments,
it has struck me that it is only for U.S. domestic consumption
that this issue is being cloaked in an environmental spin. At the
World Trade Organization and in other nations' capitals, the
Stevens-Breaux bill is seen as the belated U.S. implementation of
the 1991 GATT order to eliminate core provisions of the MMPA. The
Boxer-Biden bill is viewed as an attempt to modify certain GATT
problems that are not vital to the MMPA's dolphin conservation
goals, but also as a resolute statement that the United States
will retain its sovereign right to set the standards for product
access into the U.S. domestic market. More broadly, the current
debate on U.S. dolphin protection policy is being viewed outside
the United States as setting a precedent for U.S. allegiance to
the World Trade Organization (WTO), GATT's new successor
organization, and will be viewed as setting a model for U.S.
compliance with the WTO's future rulings. <p>

<p>

	There is fairly wide awareness in the international trade world
that the Mexican government threatened the U.S. government in the
fall of 1995 that it would challenge the MMPA at the World Trade
Organization.<a href="#[2]"></b></u>[2]<u><b></a>  In the fall of 1995, when Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo visited Washington to obtain a roll over for the
first installments in the billions of peso bailout loans Mexico
could not repay on time, he also obtained another promise from
the Administration. In exchange for a commitment that the Mexican
government would hold off its planned WTO challenge, the Clinton
Administration agreed to get rid of the MMPA through lower-profile congressional action.<a href="#[3]"></b></u>[3]<u><b></a> In retrospect, it may have been
a short-sighted deal to make considering the public and press
attention that has been raised by the prospect of the Clinton
Administration trying to eliminate in Congress important
provisions of U.S. dolphin protection law. Yet, the Clinton
Administration knew that if the Mexican government challenged the
MMPA at the WTO, the law would be again found to violate trade
rules. Only this time, the United States would no longer have the
capacity to block the decision -- thanks to the Administration's
push for the U.S. to give up its GATT veto and join the World
Trade Organization. <p>

<p>

	Thus, the sudden interest by the Clinton Administration in
changing the very core portions of the MMPA that the 1991 GATT
ruling demanded is being viewed for what it is in the trade
world: a pre-emptive cave in to implement the old GATT order to
avoid the enormous political embarrassment of having a popular
dolphin protection law become a well-publicized victim of the
WTO. And, to top it off, the Clinton Administration would face
being held WTO hostage by Mexico after having gone around
congressional opposition and 90% public opinion disapproval to
spend $30 billion U.S. tax payer dollars on a failed bailout of
wealthy investors in Mexico. By making the MMPA "go away" more
quietly via legislation such as the Stevens-Breaux bill, the
Administration is trying to get itself out of a high-profile WTO
no-win situation of either killing the dolphin law or paying
perpetual trade sanctions to Mexico. Considering that this was
exactly the sort of sovereignty threat that the Clinton
Administration promised Congress would not occur if Congress
supported the WTO, it is clear what the Administration's interest
is in implementing the 1991 GATT ruling against the MMPA. <p>

<p>

	However, it is less clear why Chairman Stevens, an articulate
opponent of the World Trade Organization for sovereignty reasons,
is willing to help the Administration avoid such well-deserved
embarrassment.<p>

<p>

	If Congress passes the Stevens-Breaux bill, Congress will have
proved what the bureaucrats at the GATT/WTO already are saying:
the United States must conform its domestic laws to the
GATT/World Trade Organization rules. The Clinton Administration
may have concluded that the strategy to avoid humiliation by a
WTO attack on a beloved U.S. law is to preemptively cave in.
However, Congress should not take the same strategy. Even for
those Members who voted for GATT/WTO, also arguing that it was
not a sovereignty threat, the damage of the precedent that would
be set by killing a GATT-attacked law is far worse than having to
admit to relying on bad information about the WTO's sovereignty
implications. This is especially the case after the rather
unavoidable embarrassment of the first WTO ruling in January
1996, which was against a U.S. environmental law, the
reformulated gasoline rules implementing some of the 1990
amendments to the Clean Air Act. In its outcome, tone, and
reasoning, the WTO's first ruling provides real life evidence of
the WTO's threat to democratic policy making, national
sovereignty and to environmental and health protections.<a href="#[4]"></b></u>[4]<u><b></a> The
WTO tribunal in this case declared that the means the United
States employed to implement public health improvements in U.S.
air quality under the Clean Air Act were not acceptable under WTO
rules. On April 29, 1996, the World Trade Organization's
appellate body ruled against the United States in what was the
only, albeit limited, internal, appeal on the case available to
the U.S. government. The Clinton Administration now faces a no-win situation regarding the clean air rules: allow in more dirty
Venezuelan gasoline undermining U.S. health and put U.S.
refineries who have already spent millions implementing the rule
at a competitive disadvantage that national security groups
estimate will put at least a quarter of the U.S. independent
refiners to bankruptcy or pay $150 million in trade sanctions to
Venezuela to keep the law. By implementing the GATT ruling
against the MMPA, the U.S. Congress is trapping itself with a bad
precedent of fidelity to the WTO's demands.<p>

<p>

2. At Issue Is Whether Congress or the WTO Will Set U.S. Domestic
Product Standards<p>

<p>

	The approach the Administration had taken to try to avoid the
political fallout of yet another messy trade issue with Mexico is
to attempt to confuse two different issues: international regimes
for fishery management versus U.S. domestic market standards. The
Administration has suddenly taken the position that in the area
of standards for tuna sold in the United States domestic market,
the U.S. must accept an international standard as a replacement
for its own domestic standard. This is also unfortunately, but
not surprisingly, the approach of the World Trade Organization,
which specifically limits the right of WTO  Member countries to
set unilateral conditions for access to their markets -- from the
U.S. Cuba embargo to the U.S. Section 301 trade law to U.S.
domestic standards for tuna fish.<p>

<p>

	Yet, it is vital to separate the two issues: one domestic and one
international. The MMPA is about U.S. domestic market standards.
After all, the MMPA concerns regulating what sorts of products
are allowed into our domestic market, not international fishing
practices generally. Fishers can fish however they want under the
MMPA. They just can't sell their fish in the U.S. market unless
they meet the MMPA's standards for domestic sale of tuna. These
U.S.-set standards were devised to compliment international
agreements in the area of dolphin protection by shaping the
powerful U.S. demand to meet the goal of dolphin conservation.
The U.S. domestic standard is clear and enforceable and is
maintained in the Boxer-Biden bill: no encirclement of dolphins
is catching tuna labelled dolphin safe for sale in the U.S.
market.<p>

<p>

	Meanwhile, the LaJolla process and the Panama Declaration go to
the second matter -- international fisheries practices. The
Panama Declaration was multilaterally derived as international
agreements should be: The goal of the agreement is to lower
dolphin mortality in tuna fishing. Normally, the United States
would sign onto such an international agreement and then enforce
its terms through domestic market access or other national
implementation mechanisms. This is how the United States
implements the Montreal Protocol (through Clean Air Act
provisions) or international driftnet and whaling conventions
(through the Pelly Amendment.) <p>

<p>

	However, in the name of ducking GATTzilla, the Clinton
Administration is pushing for an outright usurpation of the U.S.
domestic standards. Instead of domestic enforcement of an
international agreement, Stevens-Breaux would replace the clear
U.S. standard with a vague, unenforceable international standard:
no tuna can be sold in the U.S. labelled dolphin safe as long as
there were no observable dolphin deaths. Not coincidentally,
getting rid of the strong U.S. standard for "dolphin safe" and
thus getting rid of strong U.S. enforcement by eliminating the
conditions for U.S. market access, is precisely what the 1991
GATT panel ordered.<p>

<p>

3. Broad Negative Sovereignty and Trade Implications of the
Steven-Breaux Bill <p>

<p>

	Even if you do not care about the conservation of dolphins, the
trade implications of adopting the Stevens-Breaux bill are
broadly relevant. At issue is the capacity of the U.S. Congress
to adopt or enforce numerous other domestic policy measures,
including many unrelated to the environment. This is the case for
two reasons. First, as noted above, U.S. congressional action on
the MMPA will set a precedent as to what value the Congress will
give to GATT/WTO rulings against U.S. laws.<a href="#[5]"></b></u>[5]<u><b></a><p>

<p>

	But even more directly, the GATT jurisprudence that would be
adopted by U.S. congressional implementation of the 1991 GATT
ruling via a bill such as Stevens-Breaux has broad implications
on other policy areas. Included among the likely U.S. law
casualties under this WTO jurisprudence would be the driftnet
provisions dear to Chairman Stevens' heart and the shrimp
comparability standards that Senator Breaux has fought to put
into place.<a href="#[6]"></b></u>[6]<u><b></a> Most simply, if the U.S. does not defend its right
to control access to its market for tuna caught in ways that
protect dolphins, then the precedent will have been set so that
the U.S. cannot insist imported shrimp sold in this market be
caught in a manner required under the sea turtle conservation
policy, nor would we be consistent in enforcing driftnet fishing
rules.<p>

<p>

	The 1991 GATT ruling focussed on numerous grounds in ruling
against the MMPA. For instance, the panel found several elements
of technical discrimination under GATT Article III. <p>

However, the panel mainly focussed on the prohibition under GATT
for United States to set standards relating to the way a product
was produced (as compared to its physical characteristics.) Thus,
the GATT panel ruled that a can of tuna caught using dolphin safe
methods had to be treated exactly the same as a can of tuna
caught using dolphin deadly methods. In GATTese, this is the rule
forbidding market access conditionality based on unilateral
extraterritorial process standards. The panel's ruling that the
United States could not maintain laws regulating its own domestic
market with extra-territorial effects meant that Congress could
not require foreign producers to meet the same standards as
domestic producers for goods sold in the United States. <p>

<p>

	The same logic has dreadfully broad implications and is certainly
not a policy to which the U.S. Congress ought to subscribe.
Accepting the WTO prohibition of ever discriminating between
products on the basis of how they are produced or harvested would
remove from Congress the ability to ensure that U.S. industry
faces a level playing field within the U.S. market as regards
imported products. It would also eviscerate Congress'
effectiveness in many policy areas in which Congress is seeking
to promote certain political, labor, environmental or other
behaviors using the terms of access to the lucrative U.S.
consumer market as the incentive. What specifically does this
mean? One clear example has already come to light as regards
child labor. A proposed ban on the sale in the U.S. domestic
market of products made with child labor whether manufactured in
the United States or abroad has already been attacked as outside
of Congress' prerogatives because such a policy would be illegal
under GATT/WTO. Under GATT/WTO logic, a shoe is a shoe even if
one shoe was made in Louisiana under U.S. labor and environmental
laws and the other identical shoe was made by indentured child
labor in China. This is the natural application of the GATT
jurisprudence under the tuna-dolphin case that insists that
Congress must treat all cans of tuna alike unless the contents
are physically different.<p>

<p>

	This precedent would put at risk an enormous number of other U.S.
domestic policies on issues ranging from state taxes to
procurement to national defense to food safety. Thus, what is
really at stake here is who decides U.S. domestic policies and
America's sovereignty to set its own laws and control the terms
of access to its own consumer market. In considering the two
bills, I urge you to consider: What law will be attacked next at
the World Trade Organization? Maybe it will be something for
which you have fought for decades and about which you deeply
care. <p>

<p>

	Overall, the United States has not had a very good track record
in defending its laws at GATT. Now the WTO provides even stronger
enforcement. Since 1980, when the Tokyo Round of GATT first
included limitations on a country's domestic non-trade laws --
known in GATTese as "non-tariff barriers" --  the United States
has lost 80% of the cases raised by other nations against our
laws.<a href="#[7]"></b></u>[7]<u><b></a>  Recently, the United States has lost three GATT
challenges against its environmental laws and obtained a split
decision ruling against a part of a fourth environmental law.<a href="#[8]"></b></u>[8]<u><b></a>
There have only been four challenges against U.S. environmental
laws at GATT. <p>

<p>

	What U.S. law will be attacked next? The European Union, Japan
and Canada publish annual reports of U.S. laws they believe
conflict with trade rules that include many U.S. defense,
procurement, and product standard laws.<a href="#[9]"></b></u>[9]<u><b></a>  Past listing in these
other country's U.S. trade violation reports have provided grim
foreshadowing of the U.S. laws to be challenged. Past European
Union reports listed the CAFE standards and gas guzzler tax and
the Marine Mammal Protection Act's secondary embargoes which the
European Union then successfully challenged at the GATT.<p>

<p>

	A recent sampling of targeted U.S. laws in the European Union,
Japan and Canada's annual reports include: Section 301, the Cuba
boycott, multistate tax laws, Buy America provisions, the Nuclear
Non-proliferation Act, the asbestos ban, driftnet fishing and
whaling restrictions, turtle protections relating to shrimp,
federal and state raw log export bans, the Consumer Nutrition and
Education Labeling Act, state recycling laws, limitations on lead
in consumer products, and the Delaney Clause prohibiting
carcinogenic food additives.<p>

<p>

4. Boxer-Biden: A Compromise that Sets A Clear Trade Precedent
Protecting U.S. Sovereignty.<p>

<p>

	As a trade matter, the Boxer-Biden bill is a compromise offering
which carefully sets the precedent at GATT/WTO that the United
States will not blindly implement that institution's rulings
against our domestic laws. Boxer-Biden eliminates several
technical elements in the Marine Mammal Protection Act on which
the 1991 and 1993 GATT panels focussed. However, what is
importantly maintained is the principle that the United States
has the sovereign right to set standards for products to be sold
in its domestic market. Boxer-Biden provides a mechanism to
ensure this principle is enforced. <p>

<p>

	What technical problems are corrected in Boxer-Biden? The bill
eliminates a "national treatment" problem identified by the GATT
panels that is not essential to the effective operation of the
U.S. dolphin protection policy. GATT Article III generally
requires that countries do not treat foreign producers
differently than domestic producers. While the logic of this rule
from a trade perspective is to avoid arbitrary discrimination in
commerce based on nationality, in application it can cause
significant difficulties for domestic policy makers. Because the
U.S. government does not have police powers over foreign
producers, often the only way to enforce compliance with
standards for domestic sale of imported products it to condition
entry of the products of another nation into the U.S. domestic
market on meeting the standards.<a href="#[10]"></b></u>[10]<u><b></a> <p>

<p>

	The existing MMPA uses a comparability standard which sets a
maximum dolphin mortality rate for foreign fleets based on 1.25
times the U.S. rate. While this standard actually provides
preferential treatment for foreign fishers, as a technical matter
it is difficult to apply because the foreign standard cannot be
calculated until data is available for the U.S. fishers. The GATT
ruled that this was illegal discrimination between fishers of
different nations. To avoid this different treatment of domestic
and foreign fishers, Boxer-Biden sets exactly the same standard
for all fishers: they simply cannot use the encirclement
technique of tuna fishing.<p>

<p>

	As well, Boxer-Biden eliminates another national treatment
problem. Under the MMPA, if a fishing boat of a country fails to
meet the MMPA's standards, then the tuna from that entire
country's fishing fleet is not allowed into the United States.
This provision provided increased incentives for all tuna boats
to meet the dolphin safe standard. With the International
Tropical Tuna Association requiring an observer on each tuna
boat, Boxer-Biden lifts the nationwide ban on tuna imports
relying on each boat's observers to ensure compliance with the
"no encirclement" standard on a boat-by-boat basis. Boxer-Biden
thus shifts the focus from the nation to specific tuna fishing
boats. Under Boxer-Biden, standards are applied to a specific
boat's behavior. Thus, if one boat in a foreign fleet does not
meet the rules of not encircling dolphins, only the tuna from
that boat is not allowed into the United States. Tuna from other
boats from the same country would be allowed as long as those
boats are not catching tuna by encircling dolphins. This boat-by-boat focus removes the national treatment problem.<p>

<p>

	Where Boxer-Biden does not budge is in staking out three vital
policies where the World Trade Organization, not U.S. democracy
must give: <p>

<p>

	o The sovereign U.S. right to determine the standards for
products entering our domestic market through our domestic
democratic processes;<p>

<p>

	o The principle that U.S. producers should not be put at a
competitive disadvantage for meeting the laws of this land, while
foreign producers are given a pass; and<p>

<p>

	o The right to set effective U.S. domestic standards that take
into account not only a product's physical traits, but also the
way in which it was manufactured or harvested.<p>

<p>

	Thus, Boxer-Biden continues to condition access to the U.S.
market for domestic and foreign producers -- on a boat-by-boat
level -- on meeting an enforceable dolphin safe standard. That
is, to sell tuna in the U.S. market you must meet the same clear
standard of not encircling dolphins to catch tuna whether you are
a U.S. or foreign tuna fisher. <p>

<p>

5. Consumer Fraud: Public Reliance on a Fake "Dolphin Safe" Label<p>

<p>

	As a consumer group representing our large membership, I would be
remiss if I did not also raise the consumer fraud problems
Stevens-Breaux would cause.<p>

<p>

	Most simply, Stevens-Breaux would allow tuna to come into the
United States labelled "dolphin safe" even though it was caught
with the very encirclement techniques that killed hundreds of
thousands of dolphins before the Marine Mammal Protection Act was
passed. Stevens-Breaux would replace the standard of "no
encirclement" allowing tuna to be called dolphin safe merely if
an observer did not witness a dolphin die within their view
during fishing. (The standard for dolphin safe is Stevens-Breaux
is "no observable dolphin deaths.") First, given the size of tuna
ships, it is impossible that a single observer could witness the
obvious dolphin deaths that could occur at different areas on the
ship. Second, encirclement fishing uses explosives and motor boat
chase to round up dolphins and then requires the release of
trapped dolphins from nets before the mammals drown. Under these
circumstances, not seeing dead dolphins mixed on the deck with
tuna fish certainly does not ensure that dolphins are not dying
in significant numbers. Finally, there is not yet  evidence about
the effects on dolphins of the repetitive trauma, stress and
injuries dolphins suffer during encirclement. Yet, tuna caught
under these violent circumstances would be allowed into the
United States labelled as dolphin safe under the Stevens Breaux
bill as long as the sole observer did not actually witness a
dolphin death.<p>

<p>

	The MMPA was passed after a massive public campaign in which
millions of children, and ultimately all of the major U.S. tuna
companies, pressured Congress to stop the sale of dolphin-deadly
tuna. The tuna companies still support the MMPA because U.S.
consumers demand dolphin safe tuna. Under the current law,
consumers know that no company can sell tuna labelled "dolphin
safe" if a dolphin has been harassed or encircled during tuna
fishing. <p>

<p>

	Under the Stevens-Breaux bill this would no longer be the case.
The "dolphin safe" label consumers have come to rely on
guaranteeing one thing would actually have an entirely other and
unacceptable meaning -- Dolphin Deadly, but not in Front of the
Observer on the Tuna Boat. Thus, if neither the status quo can be
maintained or the Boxer-Biden bill with the strong standard
adopted, then Public Citizen would oppose the continuation of the
dolphin safe label under the definition of dolphin safe set forth
in the Stevens-Breaux bill. The U.S. consumer deserves to have an
honest label and if the weak, unenforceable standard of the
Stevens-Breaux bill were to become the law, the dolphin safe
label must go as its continuation would be a consumer fraud. <p>

Revealingly, the Mexican government rejected the option of
lifting the tuna embargo with permission to sell tuna in the
United States without the dolphin safe label. The Mexican
government knows the U.S. consumer demands dolphin safe tuna.
From their commercial perspective, committing consumer fraud by
labelling tuna caught using encirclement methods as dolphin safe
is the desired outcome of nations that do not want to fish in
dolphin safe ways.<p>

<p>

<center>Conclusion</center>
<p>

<p>

	Congressional action to change the MMPA has far reaching
implications for U.S. sovereignty and international trade policy.
Around the world, congressional action on U.S. dolphin policy is
understood to be a response to the GATT rulings against the U.S.
law which sets U.S. domestic standards for tuna fish to be sold
in the United States. If the U.S. Congress implements the GATT
rulings, and removes core provisions of the MMPA, a dangerous
precedent will have been set with implications on a wide range of
other U.S. domestic policies which other countries actually have
targeted as WTO illegal.<p>

<p>

	The World Trade Organization attempts to shift such domestic
policy questions as the standards for access to our internal
market away from citizen control and domestic democratic bodies
to negotiating committees and a dispute resolution body located
in Geneva, Switzerland which operate in secret and without the
guarantees of due process or accountability to U.S. citizens,
domestic legislatures or courts.<p>

  <p>

	The MMPA was the first case in which GATT tried to extend it
authority to demand changes in a well-know, beloved U.S. domestic
policy. Congress' actions on this legislation will directly
affect the future ability of the Congress and other legislative
bodies around the world to implement their democratically-established laws that may have a connection to trade. <p>

<p>

	It is inevitable that different policy goals will at times
conflict, for instance goals of maximizing international trade
and the goals of environmental protection. However, the decision
about which policy goal should take precedence in a particular
instance should be decided by those who will live with the
results -- in this case the American people and their
democratically elected representatives in Congress. <p>

<p>

	Thus, if Congress decides to change U.S. dolphin protection
policy, Boxer-Biden is the mechanism because it maintains U.S.
sovereignty and sets the precedent as regard U.S. Congressional
relations with the World Trade Organization.<p>

<p>

<a name="[4]">[4]</a>   The ruling illustrates the WTO's curtailment of U.S. policy-makers'
attempts to implement domestic laws. First, the WTO ruling declares the myriad
enforcement and compliance issues that inevitably shape laws and regulations
to be irrelevant.The WTO's secretive tribunal was quite open about second
guessing the best way to implement U.S. policy. The ruling vividly
demonstrates what occurs when the WTO authorizes foreign bureaucrats with no
stake in promoting the best interests of the United States, nor expertise in
U.S. health  or environmental goals, to oversee implementation of U.S.
domestic policy. The ruling states: "...WTO Members were free to set their own
environmental objectives, but they were bound to implement those objectives
through measures consistent with its [WTO's} provisions..." (WTO Panel Report
on Venezuela and Brazil's Challenge of the U.S. Reformulated Gasoline Rules,
January 16, 1996, p. 46.) This is the WTO rule of "say what you want, but do
only what we say." This ruling also attacks the U.S. government's basic,
practical enforcement tools: the ability to demand certain data from foreign
producers about their products and to regulate the producer of a target
product. The tribunal's report states: The WTO "does not allow less favorable
treatment dependent on the characteristics of the producer and the nature of
the data held by it." (WTO Panel Report on Venezuela and Brazil's Challenge of
the U.S. Reformulated Gasoline Rules, January 16, 1996, p. 35.) This
limitation calls into question how the United States can effectively enforce
any domestic law that requires provision of data for all producers -- that is
domestic and foreign producers -- to ensure compliance. The ruling is also a
classic example of the WTO's democracy threat because the U.S. rule had
withstood all challenges available through the U.S. democratic process. The
rule's domestic and foreign opponents had lobbied Congress on the 1990
amendments to the Clean Air Act, had participated in the EPA rule making, had
threatened the resulting rule with a lawsuit and had lobbied Congress to make
later changes. Venezuela was represented in the process by the high-powered
D.C. law firm of Arnold &amp; Porter. Ironically, Arnold and Porter is also
representing the Venezuelan government lobbying furiously in favor of the
Stevens-Breaux bill to get the 1991 GATT ruling against the MMPA enforced.
During the extended battle against the rule, the U.S. refineries had available
to them the same U.S. democratic procedures as were available to Venezuela.
Once these options were exhausted, U.S. gasoline refiners began implementing
the law with the expectation that they would amortize the cost over the many
years in which all gasoline in the U.S. market would face similar
environmental costs. Meanwhile, the Venezuelans were able to go to a
different, international jurisdiction without the same due process guarantees
and with a different substantive rule of law and successfully attack the rule.
The U.S. refineries, which had strongly opposed the rule during its creation,
have since spent billions implementing it. They are now demanding that the
rule continue to be applied to foreign refineries as well as U.S. refineries.
From a business perspective, they argue, the WTO's sovereignty threat
undermines their ability to make business plans. <p>

<p>

<a name="[5]">[5]</a>   Ironically, the United States is now under no international law
obligation under the old GATT to implement the past tuna-dolphin rulings.<p>

<p>

<a name="[6]">[6]</a>   These two laws would fall directly under the same bad GATT
jurisprudence used to rule against the MMPA. Both laws regulate access of
products to the U.S. market on the basis of how fishing for such products is
conducted. Under the logic of the GATT MMPA ruling, a shrimp is a shrimp and
the comparability standards are illegal process-based discrimination against
foreign fishers. The same logic applies to driftnetting: a fish is a fish no
matter how it was caught. Thus, the major victory in January 1996 in the U.S.
International Trade Court ruling that the Administration must begin enforcing
Senator Breaux's amendment to the Sea Turtle Conservation Act that would level
the playing field between U.S. and foreign shrimp fishers by requiring that
foreign fishers use sea turtle conservation techniques -- such as the Turtle
Excluder Devises -- if they want to sell their shrimp in the United States
would be set up for a successful WTO attack with the MMPA precedent. In fact,
shrimp industry sources have reported that several nations that import shrimp
into the United States have already stated their intention to bring a WTO case
against this U.S. law. Setting the precedent of the U.S. Congress eliminating
the MMPA after the GATT ruling against it would all but doom the prospects for
the sea turtle conservation policy's treatment in the <p>

USTR Mickey Kantor Detailing 13 Erroneous Statements on <p>

the GATT Uruguay Round Made by Him and/or His Staff</h2></center> <p>
<h3><center>August 3, 1994</h3></center>

<p>

<p>

The Honorable Michael Kantor<p>

600 17th Street N.W.<p>

Washington D.C.<p>

							August 3, 1994<p>

<p>

Dear Ambassador Kantor,<p>

<p>

<p>

	Critics and supporters of the Uruguay Round GATT agreements agree that they are far-reaching
in their impact.  The decision about whether the agreements should be approved in their present
form and whether the United States should enter the World Trade Organization (WTO) should be
made carefully and cautiously, after full and informed debate and discussion among the
American people.<p>

	As the negotiator and prime supporter of the trade pact, you wish to emphasize what you believe
to be the positive features of the agreements and the WTO. As a government official, however,
you have an obligation also to honestly and reasonably report on -- and at least acknowledge --
ambiguities or drawbacks contained in the agreements you are advocating. <p>

	As the debate over the WTO and the new GATT has proceeded, you and your deputies have
increasingly slighted this public official duty. Your response to detailed criticisms or carefully
expressed concerns has been to dismiss the critics as ill-informed or to answer them with
misleading statements, distortions and deceptions. <p>

	The purpose of this letter is to rebut, for the public record, a number of your long list of
erroneous statements, and to urge you to reconsider your approach to the WTO-GATT debate
and to give the American people a decent interval of time to digest the WTO-GATT proposal.<p>

<p>

<b>Erroneous Statement Number 1:</b> The World Trade Organization is not much different than the
existing GATT, thus fears about sovereignty are misplaced.  Written testimony of USTR Mickey Kantor before the Senate Commerce Committee, June
16, 1994; written testimony of Deputy USTR Rufus Yerxa before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, June 14, 1994.<p>

<b>Correction:</b> The existing GATT is an international business contract between nations (like
NAFTA) who are called contracting parties. Congressional approval of the Uruguay Round
would make the United States a member of a permanent new global trade agency, the World
Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO would: maintain an international "legal personality" akin
to the United Nations; Agreement Establishing the WTO. <i></i>Article VIII-1 (to which treaty practice under the Vienna
Convention would apply, according to Note to the Final Act Embodying the Results of the
Uruguay Round of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations). possess on-going rule making capacity; <i>Id</i>., Article III-2; Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, Articles 38-39
(establishing a Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, etc.). and operate a binding <p>

<p>

<p>

dispute resolution system whose decisions would be enforced with trade sanctions and fines. Dispute Settlement Understanding, Article 22.  	The creation of a new standing organization has great significance. As a contractual arrangement
rather than an independent actor, GATT has owed its political legitimacy to the consent of the
GATT contracting parties. GATT has been cautious in taking actions without express
authorization, and, because signatories to GATT did not cede any power to a standing
organization, has operated almost exclusively by consensus.<p>

	A vote for the Uruguay Round would dramatically alter both the political and legal status of the
GATT/WTO. Reflecting the WTO's legal status and enhanced political authority, important
decisions under the WTO regime would be made by one-country, one-vote voting. Agreement Establishing the WTO, Article IX-1 (describing voting procedures for
amendments); Article III-2 (providing for new negotiations upon simple majority voting of the
"Ministerial Conference" of all WTO Members).<p>

	Unlike GATT, the World Trade Organization includes an affirmative international obligation to
"ensure the conformity of [a country's] laws, regulations and administrative procedures" with the
WTO rules. <i>Id</i>. Article XVI-4.  In its April 1994 report on U.S. laws that allegedly violate the WTO mandate, the
European Union lays out the U.S. obligation clearly: "The comprehensive multilateral dispute
settlement mechanism which has been agreed upon in the framework of the World Trade
Organization will ... oblige [countries] to bring their domestic legislation into conformity with all
of the Uruguay Round agreements. Services of the European Commission, <i>Report on United States Barriers to Trade and
Investment</i>, p.7.   <p>

<p>

<b>Erroneous Statement Number 2:</b> The WTO will operate by consensus; "[in] fact, Article IX of
the WTO Agreement codifies what was merely a custom in the GATT. It makes consensus the
governing principle for WTO for decision-making." USTR Fact Sheet, <i>U.S. Sovereignty Under the World Trade Agreement: Debunking the
Myths</i>, 1994; See also oral testimony of Deputy USTR Rufus Yerxa before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, June 14, 1994, as transcribed by Federal News Service. <p>

    <p>

<b>Correction:</b> The Administration has regularly cited only a portion of the relevant WTO
agreement provision on decision-making. Administration officials refer to the first sentence of
Article IX-1 of the Agreement Establishing the WTO, "The WTO shall continue the practice of
decision-making by consensus followed under the GATT. ..." But Administration officials
consistently fail, in Congressional testimony and otherwise, to cite the next sentence, which <p>

<p>

<p>

reads, "Except as otherwise provided, where a decision cannot be arrived at by consensus, the
matter at issue shall be decided by voting ... each member of the WTO shall have once vote." Agreement Establishing the WTO, <i></i>Article IX-1. 	<p>

	Important decisions that would be made by majority and supermajority voting, instead of
consensus, include: decisions to amend the WTO rules; <i>Id</i>. Article X (providing for assorted two-thirds and three-fourths supermajority voting
rules). interpretations of the WTO rules; Id. Article IX-2 (providing for interpretations on three-fourths vote).
decisions to allow additional countries to become WTO Members; <i>Id</i>. Article XII (providing for two-thirds votes on accessions). and decisions to start new
negotiations and implement the results of such negotiations. <i>Id</i>. Article III-2 (providing for simple majority voting of the Ministerial Conference).  Decisions to adopt the ruling of
WTO dispute resolution panels would be taken by <u>reverse</u> consensus, requiring all countries to
agree <u>not</u> to adopt a panel ruling. Dispute Settlement Understanding,  16.4 (for panel rulings) and  17.14 (for appellate
reports).<p>

	Indeed, rather than consensus decision-making being the rule under the proposed WTO, it is the
specifically cited exception, and is only specifically cited in the WTO Agreement in the context
of amendments to five specific WTO or GATT articles. <i>Agreement Establishing the WTO, </i>Article X-2.<p>

<p>

<b>Erroneous Statement Number 3:</b> Under the WTO, no substantive change in the rights and
obligations of the United States can occur under any of its provisions unless the United States
agrees to it. Oral testimony of Deputy USTR Rufus Yerxa before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, June 14, 1994, as transcribed by Federal News Service; Oral testimony of USTR
Mickey Kantor before the Senate Commerce Committee, June 16, 1994. June 14, 1994, as
transcribed by the Federal News Service;  USTR Fact Sheet, <i>U.S. Sovereignty Under the World
Trade Agreement: Debunking the Myths</i>, 1994 ("The WTO Amendment provisions in Article X
state that any substantive amendment takes effect for a member only if that country consent to
it.").  <p>

<b>Correction: </b>USTR's claim that no decisions affecting U.S. "rights and obligations" under the
WTO can be taken without its agreement is clearly undermined by the provisions on initiating
and implementing new negotiations by a majority vote of the Ministerial Conference. Agreement Establishing the WTO, Article III-2. However,
even under Article X of the Agreement Establishing the WTO, which provides special
procedures for amending provisions that would alter a WTO Member's rights and obligations, the
decision about whether a proposed amendment does alter such rights and obligations is taken by
a three-fourths vote. <i>Id</i>. Article X-1.  If a three-fourths majority agrees that such rights and obligations are not
affected, then amendments can be voted by a two-thirds majority with the results binding on all
Members. <i>Id</i>. Article X-4.  Even if three-fourths of the WTO Members decide that a proposed amendment does
alter rights and obligations and the amendment is adopted by a two-thirds vote and only applies
to the members voting for it, a three-fourths vote of the WTO Members can decide whether the
Members who do not accept the amendment shall still be allowed to remain Members. <i>Id</i>. Article X-3.<p>

<p>

<b>Erroneous Statement Number 4:</b> The existing GATT provides for majority voting, thus the
Uruguay Round is "much more protective of  U.S. sovereignty" by moving decision-making
from majority to supermajority voting. Oral Testimony of USTR Mickey Kantor before the Ways and Means Committee, June 10,
1994, as transcribed by the Federal News Service ("In many cases, decisions under the GATT
could be made by a majority vote"). See also written testimony of USTR Mickey Kantor before
the Senate Commerce Committee, June 16, 1994.  <p>

<b>Correction:</b> Because the International Trade Organization (ITO) proposed in 1947 was not
approved by the U.S. Senate, GATT has never had the political legitimacy to activate its voting
rules. GATT virtually never operated by any voting. The last GATT vote was in 1959. In fact, as
USTR regularly emphasizes in other contexts, GATT decisions are made by consensus. Thus, the
real change with the establishment of the WTO is the switch from consensus decision-making to
one-nation, one-vote voting. <p>

	This change effectively eliminates the veto the United States has enjoyed as a sovereignty
safeguard under the existing GATT. Under the WTO, the United States would not maintain the
effective veto now provided by consensus decision-making in dispute resolution and other
decisions under the current GATT.<p>

	In the context of dispute resolution, the United States would specifically lose a veto which it has
had available under the existing GATT and used to stop the 1991 tuna-dolphin ruling. The
WTO's proposed dispute settlement process would be unique among international organizations
in requiring consensus to <u>stop</u> action rather than consensus to <u>commit</u> a sovereign nation to
international action. The rulings of the WTO's dispute resolution tribunals would be
automatically adopted 60 days after publication, unless every WTO Member, including the
victorious plaintiff nation, opposes adoption. Dispute Settlement Understanding,  16.4. (An internal appeal is provided with a similar
negative veto which would be required to stop adoption for its ruling. <i>Id</i>.  17.) Similarly, if the United
States refused or failed to repeal or revise a law held to be an illegal trade barrier, after a set
number of days, the WTO would automatically authorize trade sanctions unless every WTO
Member including the complaining nation opposed sanctions. <i>Id</i>.  22.6. <p>

	In non-dispute resolution contexts, there is no veto because there is no consensus decision-making either, except for five WTO or GATT articles specifically listed under Article X-2 of the
Agreement Establishing the WTO for which consensus is required to approve an amendment.<p>

	In sum, not only does the United States lose the veto it now has under the current requirement of
consensus to adopt a panel ruling and consensus to authorize sanctions, it would now (after an
unfavorable WTO tribunal ruling) have to build a unanimous consensus just to stop WTO action
against it.<p>

<p>

<b>Erroneous Statement Number 5:</b> Congress maintains full control over the passage,
maintenance and repeal of  U.S. laws under the World Trade Organization's regime. This assertion has been made throughout testimony and other public statements. See e.g.
written testimony of USTR Mickey Kantor before the House Ways and Means Committee, June
10, 1994; and written testimony of Deputy USTR Rufus Yerxa before the Senate Foreign
Relations, June 14, 1994.  "A WTO
dispute settlement panel recommendation has no effect on U.S. law." Memo to Congress, Nancy A. LeaMond, Assistant USTR for Congressional Affairs, July
19, 1994.<p>

<b>Correction:</b> While it is true that only Congress can establish, alter or repeal a federal law, WTO
tribunals would have the authority to determine the WTO-legality of U.S. laws and to exert
enormous pressure on the United States to alter laws found "WTO-illegal." The WTO could
force Congress into making a cruel choice: either alter or repeal a law determined to be WTO-illegal or face perpetual trade sanctions against any U.S. industry the winning country chooses. Dispute Settlement Understanding, Article 22. 
Moreover, the threat of such challenges and the ensuing no-win dilemma would have a chilling
effect on Congress, deterring the legislature from passing laws that are claimed by opponents in
the United States and in other WTO nations to be WTO-illegal; and the threats would also have a
chilling effect on proposals by both agencies and citizen groups.<p>

<p>

<b>Erroneous Statement Number 6:</b> Countries won't follow through in using WTO-authorized
sanctions against the United States because the United States is the largest trading nation in the
world and other countries would be reluctant to run the risk of closing themselves off from U.S.
markets. Oral testimony of USTR Mickey Kantor before the House Ways and Means Committee,
June 10, 1994, as transcribed by the Federal News Service, answering a question asked by
Representative Newt Gingrich.<p>

<b>Correction:</b> Logically, the administration cannot have it both ways. The WTO cannot be a big
stick to open markets when wielded by the United States, yet a limp reed when held by others
over the United States. Either no WTO Members -- including the United States -- will use the
powerful new dispute resolution mechanism, or the United States <u>and</u> other countries will use it. <p>

	The WTO -- with its automatic imposition of perpetual fines or perpetual cross-sector retaliatory
sanctions in cases where a domestic law that is found to be WTO-illegal is not altered or
eliminated -- would give foreign countries enormous leverage over the United States.	Moreover, unlike NAFTA, the WTO member countries would include two major trading powers:
Japan and the European Union. Both have threatened trade measures against the United States
when displeased by U.S. trade behavior before, as has Canada. Under the WTO, these countries
would be authorized to take such actions against the United States with full approval and support
of a global agency and its Members.<p>

	Finally, it is peculiarly reprehensible to state, as the Administration prepares to enter the United
States into a powerful new international organization with a vast array of attendant obligations,
that the United States does not intend to respect its international commitments.<p>

<p>

<b>Erroneous Statement Number 7:</b> WTO dispute settlement panels do not have the power to
make "decisions" or impose solutions. Panels will issue reports containing their views on the
dispute and a recommendation to the disputing parties. USTR Fact Sheet, <i>U.S. Sovereignty Under the World Trade Organization: Debunking the
Myths</i>, 1994.<p>

<b>Correction:</b> The actual language of the Dispute Settlement Understanding paints quite a
different picture. It reads, "Within sixty days of issuance of a panel report to the Members, the
report shall be adopted at a DSB (Dispute Settlement Body) meeting unless one of the parties to
the dispute formally notifies the DSB of its decision to appeal or the DSB decides by consensus
not to adopt the report." Dispute Settlement Understanding,  16.4.  Appeals are limited to a review of the application of GATT rules to
the facts and must be completed in 60 days. <i>Id</i>.  17.6,  17.5.  "An appellate report shall be adopted by the DSB
and unconditionally accepted by the parties to the dispute unless the DSB decides by consensus
not to adopt the appellate report within thirty days following its issuance to the Members." <i>Id</i>.  17.14. 
"Where a Panel or Appellate Body concludes that a measure is inconsistent with a covered
agreement, it shall recommend that the Member concerned bring the measure into conformity
with that Agreement". <i>Id</i>.  19.1.  "Compensation and the suspension of concessions or other obligations
are temporary measures available in the event that the recommendations and rulings are not
implemented within a reasonable period of time." <i>Id</i>.  22.1. <p>

	In summary, once a three-person tribunal rules and its decision is approved by the internal WTO
appellate body (if an appeal is even taken), the decision is final, unless all members of the WTO
arrive at a consensus to reject the tribunal decision. Then a country must change its law or face
sanctions. <p>

<p>

<b>Erroneous Statement Number 8:</b> The United States can maintain any food safety or
environmental standard as long as it based on science. USTR Fact Sheet, <i>Questions and Answers for the State Attorneys General</i>, 1994.<p>

<b>Correction:</b> "Based on science" is only one of a series of tests in the Uruguay Round food
standards that U.S. food laws must pass to avoid being labelled an unfair trade barrier that must
be eliminated. Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. In fact, even supporters of the Uruguay Round have admitted to the  <i>National
Journal</i> that many U.S. laws would not meet some of the proposed WTO requirements.  <i>National Journal</i>, July 16, 1994, p.1686.<p>

	The most worrisome tests are those specifying the means a country may use to obtain even a
WTO-legal objective. Two such "means" tests are the "least trade restrictive" means test and a
rule prohibiting countries from distinguishing products on the basis of how they were produced.
(For instance, protecting dolphins by distinguishing between fishing techniques that are dolphin
safe and those that kill large numbers of dolphins.) <p>

	Under the least trade restrictive rule, a U.S. law would fail to pass WTO muster -- no matter how
acceptable the law's <u>goal</u> might be in WTO terms -- if the <u>means</u> used to accomplish that goal is
not the least trade restrictive. Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, Article 2.2.  Congress would have to repeal or alter any law found to have
failed this test by a WTO tribunal, or the United States would face perpetual fines or trade
sanctions. Indeed, in our February 1993 meeting, you acknowledged your own concern about the
"least trade restrictive" test, which you said you were able to limit somewhat in NAFTA.<p>

	As for the prohibition on distinction based on "process standards," in early 1993, you expressed
dismay to a large gathering of environmental and consumer representatives about the application
of this rule to the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act in the successful 1991 Mexican challenge
of that U.S. law.  As applied in the GATT tuna-dolphin cases, this rule required the United States
to treat tuna caught with methods that result in high dolphin-kill rates and that caught with
dolphin-safe methods the same. Applied in another context, it could require the United States to
treat goods made with ozone-depleting processes and those made with other methods in the same
fashion if the goods were physically the same. <p>

	The least trade restrictive means test and process-distinction tests have been the basis of the two
recent GATT challenges to U.S. environmental laws, and that was before those rules were
specifically enumerated in the text, as they are in the Uruguay Round proposal. In the
tuna-dolphin challenge, the United States lost the case because it distinguished on the basis of
process -- not because of any purported failure to base the law on science. In the European Union
challenge to the U.S. CAFE and gas guzzler fuel efficiency standards (a challenge which the
United States has been widely predicted to lose), the challenging parties agreed that the U.S. goal
of fuel efficiency is allowable and do not question the scientific justification of the goal or the
scientific efficacy of the United States means to achieve it; the dispute is over the political issue
of how the goal should be achieved, including whether it is through minimum automobile miles-per-gallon standards or a carbon tax. <p>

	 Finally, as an aside, it important to note that the "based on science" test itself is neither as simple
or objective as you imply. Application of the test will be made by the secret WTO tribunals,
whose members are trade experts, not scientists or even lawyers or officials with a background in
consumer, environmental or related matters. This method itself, especially the secrecy, is quite an
unscientific way to proceed.<p>

<p>

<b>Erroneous Statement Number 9:</b> The Uruguay Round rules do not require downward
harmonization. Written testimony of USTR Mickey Kantor before the Senate Commerce Committee, June
16, 1994.  <p>

<b>Correction:</b> While harmonization is required in both the food and technical standards chapters, Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, Article 9-13; Agreement on Technical
Barriers to Trade, Articles 2.4 and 2.6.
it is not specifically labelled as upwards or downwards harmonization. However, the rules that
make up those chapters will result in downward harmonization of strong U.S. standards. <p>

	First, under the WTO's two standards chapters, a domestic law can be found to be a trade barrier
because it is stronger than international standards, but not because it is too weak. Only laws that
are stronger than named international standards will be subject to a battery of tests in order to
establish that they are not illegal trade barriers that must be eliminated. Meanwhile, with the
exception of prison labor, GATT, Article XX-e. no country's law can be attacked as WTO-illegal because it provides
too weak protection to the environment or to consumer or worker safety and health.<p>

	Second, both the food and technical standards texts require countries to base their standards on
specified international standards. Standards issued by several of the international standard-setting
bodies are weaker than current U.S. domestic laws and regulations require. For technical
standards -- all non-food standards such as product safety or environmental rules "where
technical regulations are required and relevant international standards exist or their completion is
imminent, Members shall use them, or the relevant parts of them, as a basis for their technical
regulations, except when such international standards ... would be an ineffective or inappropriate
means for the fulfillment of the legitimate objectives pursued, for instance because of
fundamental climatic or geographical factors or fundamental technological problems." Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, Article 2.4.  In the
food area, domestic standards also must be "based on" the named international food standards of
the Codex Alimentarius Commission.  Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards, Article 9.  According to the General Accounting Office (GAO), the
United States established more health protective pesticide standards in 66 percent of the cases
where the comparison could be made. General Accounting Office, <i>International Food Safety: Comparison of U.S. and Codex
Pesticide Standards</i>, August, 1991, p.28.  <p>

<p>

<b>Erroneous Statement Number 10:</b> It is unlikely that there will be many challenges brought
under the Uruguay Round agreements against U.S. laws. Oral testimony of USTR Mickey Kantor before the Senate Commerce Committee, June 16,
1994, as transcribed by Federal News Service.<p>

<b>Correction:</b> Although the United States has often been a plaintiff in past GATT challenges, that
will change under the WTO. The Uruguay Round would expand trade disciplines beyond the
traditional trade matters in which the United States is situated to be a plaintiff and into non-tariff
issues -- namely the many standards setting environmental, health, labor and other requirements
for products sold in the United States. In these areas, the United States is likely to be a defendant
because of its more advanced health and safety protections. Moreover, the change to binding
GATT dispute resolution (that would require a country to change laws found to be GATT-illegal,
or accept sanctions or pay fines) from a system with largely advisory dispute resolution (a panel
suggested a course of action that a country had to agree to) will in itself stimulate more cases.
The long lists published in 1994 by the European Union, Canada and Japan of laws they and
their motivated domestic corporate interests consider to violate the new rules illustrate the
magnitude of the risk to domestic U.S. federal and state laws and standards. <p>

<p>

<b>Erroneous Statement Number 11:</b> It is very unlikely that there will be many challenges
brought under the Uruguay Round agreements against state laws. USTR Fact Sheet, <i>Questions and Answers for the State Attorneys General, </i>July 1994.  <p>

<b>Correction:</b> In addition to the general incentives the Uruguay Round presents to foreign
countries to challenge many U.S. laws, the proposed new substantive trade rules -- such as those
requiring consistency of level of risk -- provide many new tools for challenges of state laws
merely because they are different than federal laws. Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, Article 20.  While the European Union, Canada and
Japan have published lists of laws they consider to violate GATT in previous years, this year's
reports, which are based on the proposed new Uruguay Round rules, contain extensive new lists
of state environmental, health, tax and other laws. <p>

	The European Union's "Report on United States Barriers to Trade and Investment, 1994" goes so
far as to attack the U.S. federalist system, and the diversity of rules and standards it encourages,
as a trade barrier in itself. "There are more than 2,700 State and municipal authorities in the
United States which require particular safety certifications for products sold or installed within
their jurisdiction," the EU report complains. And it alleges, "Even if, in general, not intentionally
discriminatory, the complexity of U.S. regulatory systems in this domain [technical regulations
regarding consumer, health, safety and environmental protection] can represent a very important
<b>structural impediment</b> to market access" (emphasis in original). Services of the European Commission, <i>Report on United States Barriers to Trade and
Investment</i>, 1994, p.55. <b></b><p>

<p>

<b>Erroneous Statement Number 12:</b> GATT rules will fully protect the right of any state to
impose stringent health or environmental standards, including those more protective than federal
standards. USTR Fact Sheet, <i>Questions and Answers for State Attorneys General</i>, July 1994.   <p>

<b>Correction:</b> GATT's two standards chapters both directly threaten strong state environmental
and consumer laws. For instance, the Technical Barriers chapter requires domestic standards to
be based on international standards that are complete or near completion unless there are
fundamental climatic, geographic or technological reasons not to use them. Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, Article 2.4.   That a state
believes such international standards do not provide sufficient health or environmental protection
is not a WTO-legitimate justification for departing from the international standard, much less a
federal standard. The food standards contained in the Sanitary and Phytosanitary chapter
specifically require domestic laws to avoid distinctions in the level of protection provided. "With
the objective of achieving consistency in the application of the concept of appropriate level of
sanitary and phytosanitary protection ... each member shall avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable
distinctions in the levels it considers to be appropriate in different situations..." Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, Article 20.  Although these
rules also apply to federal law, as noted by the Attorneys General, state laws are especially at risk
because of the very difference between federal and state standards that is the cornerstone of
federalism. The WTO does not provide a federalism exception for such differences, nor does it
limit the definitions of "arbitrary" or "unjustifiable" to allow differences between federal and
state decision-makers facing the same data and risks in making different political decisions about
how much risk to accept. <p>

	In our nation's history, the very absence of an international uniformity straitjacket (and the
allowance for state diversity, within the limits of not arbitrarily burdening interstate commerce)
has freed our country to lead the world rather than follow a lower common denominator. <p>

	 <p>

<b>Erroneous Statement Number 13:</b> The unilateral trade measures of Section 301 remain useable
under GATT. Written testimony of USTR Mickey Kantor before the House Ways and Means Committee
June 10, 1994; Written testimony of Rufus Yerxa before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, June 14, 1994. See also, Memo to Congress, Nancy A. LeaMond, Assistant USTR
for Congressional Affairs, July 19, 1994.<p>

 <p>

<b>Correction:</b> As virtually all commentators outside of the U.S. Trade Representative's office
agree, the unilateral action provisions of Section 301 and its hybrids will not survive the WTO's
Dispute Resolution Article 23. The Congressional Research Service's American Legal Division
issued an opinion memo to Representative Cardiss Collins about Section 301 being effectively
gutted by Article 23's ban on "unilateralism." Representative Richard Gephardt's office, having
admitted that Section 301 would be unenforceable under the new rules for most uses, has tried
unsuccessfully to find alternatives to trade sanctions to enforce some sort of unilateral trade
measure. With regard to Section 301 and other U.S. unilateral measures, the government of Japan
has written, "The United States' attitude of pursuing market opening in bilateral negotiations
backed by the threat of sanctions is not compatible with the multilateral trade system of the
GATT/WTO." Government of Japan, <i>1994 Report on Unfair Trade Policies by Major Trading Partners</i>,
1994, p.259<b></b>.  The European Union has also objected to the U.S. use of Section 301, as well as
other unilateral trade measures, including those contained in environmental laws. Services of the European Commission, <i>Report on the United States Barriers to Trade and
Investment</i>, 1994, p.7 ("[T]he new World Trade Organization will restrain the Contracting Parties
from further having to resort to unilateral determinations in trade disputes, and will oblige them
to bring their domestic legislation in conformity with all of the Uruguay Round Agreements."
The report then labels United States efforts to renew Super 301 as "contrary to this."). <p>

<p>

	With the debate over the WTO and the new GATT clouded by these and other erroneous USTR
statements, it is difficult for citizens, the media or Representatives and Senators to make a
reasoned assessment of the WTO-GATT proposals.<p>

	It is not too late to provide Congress and the American people with a full assessment of the
impact on our democracy and standards of domestic justice posed by the WTO and the new
GATT. Deferring the Congressional consideration of the WTO and the new GATT until next
year would give the American democratic process a chance to work properly. <p>

Sincerely,<p>

constitutional authority over regulation of
foreign commerce) to the executive
branch allowing the executive branch to
conduct trade negotiations and, <p>

<p>

	 Sets in advance of negotiations the
terms for congressional consideration of
any resulting trade agreement, requiring:<p>

<p>

		- Congress to vote only "yes" or "no"
with <u>absolutely no amendments</u> allowed
on a completed trade agreement and the
implementing legislation required to
bring all existing U.S. laws and policies
into conformity with such an agreement,
and<p>

<p>

		- Maximum of 20 hours of floor debate in
each chamber.<p>

<p>

		- Such a vote must occur within 60
legislative days after the agreement and
implementing legislation are presented to
Congress by the Executive branch.<p>

<p>

		- Not only the actual agreement, but the
domestic implementing legislation is
written by the Executive branch
bypassing regular congressional
committee procedures, such as mark ups. Statutory references for specific fast track provisions: No amendments to the implementing legislation or
the trade agreement are permitted under the fast-track procedures is 19 U.S.C.  2191(d).  The 60 day voting
requirement consists of two aspects contained at 19 U.S.C.  2191(e): The congressional committees to which
the implementing bill is referred have only 45 legislative days to review it but without any changes, at which
time it is automatically referred to the full House, and a floor vote must then be taken within 15 legislative days.
In calculating the time periods for action in either chamber, the days on which that House is not in session are
excluded. 19 U.S.C.  2191(e)(3). The limitation of debate to not more than 20 hours, divided equally between
those favoring and those opposing the legislation is 19 U.S.C.  2191(f)(2) &amp; (g)(2).<p>

<p>

<b>Unique Limitations on Congressional Authority, Role
in Trade Policy</b><p>

<p>

No other such severe limitations of
congressional authority exist in U.S. law.
For instance, while certain budget votes
are granted closed rules automatically
and in advance, such votes are on bills
shaped by Congress that have undergone
extensive congressional committee
process.<p>

<p>

Supporters of the fast track concept argue
that Congress must give up to right to
regular committee process and floor
amendments on trade agreements to
provide U.S. trade negotiators with
credibility that the terms they negotiate
with other countries won't be re-opened
by Congress. By banning any
amendments and also strictly limiting
Congress' role in overseeing actual
negotiations, fast track supporters argue
that the procedures force Congress into
accepting hard compromises made in one
area of negotiation needed to make gains
in others. According to this notion, fast
track forces to swallow many smaller
bitter pills in the name of a greater good
accomplished by the whole deal.<p>

<p>

Opponents of fast track argue that
Congress must have a greater role in U.S.
trade and investment policy given the
direct, domestic impact such policies will
have on their constituents. Additionally,
opponents have voiced concern that U.S.
negotiators do not necessarily represent
the full range of U.S. interests at the
negotiating table. Some argue that the
diffuse, but vital interests in good jobs
and high wages shared by most
Americans are subsumed to narrower,
more strongly articulated interests of
major corporations and investors. The
role of such corporations in
institutionalized in fast track, as that law
also established advisory committees
staffed with over 500 corporate
representatives to give private sector
input in exchange for Congress giving up
its previous greater involvement in trade
policy. Lawsuits by Public Citizen
against the lack of balance in the fast
track trade advisory committee system
since 1992 have resulted in token
representation of a few citizens'
organizations in these committees.<p>

<p>

Congressional concern about fast track's
limitation of a congressional role in trade
and investment policy has grown
considerably in since the 1993 passage of
the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) and the 1994
passage of the Uruguay Round of the
General Agreement on tariffs and Trade
(GATT.) These agreements contained
lengthy provisions directly affected U.S.
domestic investment, environmental,
labor and consumer standards laws and
their implementing legislation
specifically changed hundreds of
provisions in such laws. Thus, these
agreements' results, unlike the results of
past trade agreements focussing on tariff
or quota reduction, have had direct and
personal effects on many Americans in
areas for which they hold their Members
of Congress accountable. <p>

<p>

As well, fast track allows many matters
unrelated to trade to be "superglued" onto
trade legislation. Because no
amendments are allowed, Congress is
thus forced into rejecting entire trade
agreements or approving special deals
and unsavory  amendments. For instance,
the GATT implementing legislation
included: unrelated provisions changing
important U.S. pension laws including a
special deal for a particular company that
has been protested by many senior
citizens; tax breaks to certain interests;
special access to communications
licenses for several specific companies;
controversial changes in the U.S. Savings
Bond Program; new requirements for
electronic tax filing and many more.<p>

<p>

Some Members of Congress have begun
to argue that the Legislative and
executive branches should redesign their
cooperation in the area of international
trade and investment to provide a more
balanced role for Congress. Given that
the regulation of international commerce
is Congress' constitutional role, Congress
has the power to redesign such a
relationship according to how much
authority is decides to delegates away to
the Executive branch.<p>

<p>

<b>Fast Track As A Congressional Delegation Of
Authority <p>

	To Negotiate<p>

</b><p>

The best way to think about how fast
track is applied to any specific agreement
is to think of it in two pieces: fast track
generally and application of fast track to
any specific negotiations.<p>

<p>

Currently, the overarching fast track
authority is expired and has been expired
for two years. The discussion about
whether fast track will include labor or
environmental language (a discussion
which is much more complicated than it
seems given that only certain types of
labor or environmental language will
have any effect whatsoever on actual
negotiating objectives) refers to the terms
of this overarching legislation's design.
Reauthorization of any fast track, or any
alternative trade negotiating authority
Congress might choose to confer on the
executive branch, will require a specific
vote of Congress on legislation
describing that delegation.<p>

<p>

If such an overarching fast track
authority is granted by Congress, to apply
fast track's rules to a particular trade
agreement, a President must request such
a specific delegation of negotiating
authority and of congressional no-amendments, limited debate vote.
Congress must vote not to stop automatic
application of fast track once this request
has been made. <p>

<p>

Specifically, to obtain negotiating
authority and such a pre-agreed closed
rule, the President must notify Congress
that he wants to negotiate a specific trade
agreement with fast-track procedures. Notification is at 19 U.S.C.  2902(c)(3)(C).  <p>

Congress may then vote to refuse the
application of fast-track procedures to a
specific agreement by a vote of both
Houses in any 60-day period, or by a
disapproval vote of either the Senate
Committee on Finance or the House
Committee on Ways and Means within
60 days of the notification of the
negotiations. Disapproval is at 19 U.S.C.  2903(c)(1)(A) &amp; (2).  <p>

<p>

If Congress grants such authority, the
President is then free to negotiate the
agreement. The President must next
involve Congress by notifying Congress
90 calendar days before he intends to
sign a trade agreement. After the
President enters into (<u>i.e.</u>, signs) the
agreement following the expiration of the
congressional notice period, he may
thereafter submit the signed trade
agreement, implementing legislation, and
certain required supporting information
to Congress for approval. <u>Id</u>.  2903(1)(B). The
implementing legislation must include a
provision approving the trade agreement,
and that legislation must be enacted into
law before any trade agreement
concerning nontariff trade barriers may
enter into force with respect to the United
States. 19 U.S.C.  2191(b)(1)(A); 2903(a)(1)(C). <p>

<p>

While the fast-track procedures establish
a maximum timetable for a vote on the
trade agreement, there is no requirement
that the congressional approval process
take the entire 60 or 90 day period.  The
timetable was accelerated for political
reasons for the congressional vote on
NAFTA.   Even though it was not readily
accessible to the public at that time, the
President submitted the implementing
legislation to Congress on November 4,
1993,.  The House voted less than two
weeks later on November 17, 1993, and
the Senate voted the following week on
November 22, 1993.  Thus, the period for
developing a full congressional record on
the trade agreement and its implementing
legislation can be truncated even further
than the fast-track timetable.<p>

<p>

The Congress is then required to have a
"yes" or "no" vote. If Congress votes yes,
it incorporates the terms of the actual
trade agreement as well as all
amendments in the implementing
legislation into U.S. federal law.<p>

<h1><center>WTO Talking Points:</h1></center> <p>

<center><h2>The World Trade Organization Ruling Against the
Reformulated Gasoline Regulations of the U.S. Clean Air
Act</center></h2><p>

The WTO ruling provides a real life example of the problems raised during the
contentious WTO approval battle by WTO opponents across the political spectrum.<p>

In its outcome, tone, and reasoning, the first ruling of the World Trade Organization      The World Trade Org. was established 1/1/95 under the terms of the GATT Uruguay Round.
against U.S. clean air rules provides a real life example of the WTO's threat to
environmental and health protections, democratic policy making and national
sovereignty. In this case, three unaccountable trade bureaucrats at the WTO's Geneva
headquarters second-guessed U.S. policy makers. The tribunal declared that the
means the U.S. employed to implement public health improvements in U.S. air
quality under the Clean Air Act were not acceptable under WTO rules. The WTO
requires  " each Member ensure the conformity of its laws, regulations and
administrative procedures" WTO rules.      Agreement Establishing the WTO, Article XVI-4. Beyond a limited internal appeal to a WTO
review panel, the U.S. faces only two undesirable choices: change the rule or pay $150
million in trade sanctions annually. It is the WTO that must be changed, not the U.S.
policy.<p>

<p>

The ruling illustrates WTO's curtailment of U.S. policy-makers to implement our
laws.<p>

This WTO ruling would strip the U.S. government of some basic, practical
enforcement tools: the ability to demand certain data from foreign producers about
their products and to regulate the producer of a target product. The WTO declares the
myriad enforcement and compliance issues that inevitably shape laws and
regulations are irrelevant. The tribunal's report states: The WTO "does not allow less
favorable treatment dependent on the characteristics of the producer and the nature
of the data held by it."      Panel Opinion, p. 35. This limitation calls into question how the U.S. can enforce
any domestic law that requires provision of data for all producers -- that is domestic
<u>and</u> foreign producers -- to ensure compliance. This limitation is an extension of the
1994 GATT ruling against provisions of the U.S. Corporate Average Fuel Economy
standards (CAFE) in which a tribunal held that the U.S. could not distinguish
between specific automobiles on the basis of the producer's average fuel economy
even when a law was facially nondiscriminatory.      The GATT was an international trade contract that preceded the WTO.<p>

<p>

The ruling demonstrates the WTO's threat to popular democracy, national
sovereignty.<p>

This case is a classic example of the WTO's democracy threat because the losing rule
had withstood all challenges available through the U.S. democratic process. The
rule's domestic and foreign opponents had lobbied Congress in the Clean Air Act
debate, had participated in the rule making, had threatened the resulting rule with a
lawsuit and had lobbied Congress to make later changes. Venezuela was represented
in the process by the high-powered D.C. law firm of Arnold &amp; Porter. During the
extended battle against the rule, the U.S. refineries had available to them the same
U.S. democratic procedures -- lobbying, rule making and the courts -- as available to
Venezuela. Once these options were exhausted, the U.S. refiners began implementing
the law with the expectation that they would amortize the cost over the many years in
which all gasoline in the U.S. market would face similar costs. Meanwhile, the
Venezuelans were able to go to a different, international jurisdiction without the
same due process guarantees and with a different substantive rule of law and
successfully attack the rule. The U.S. refineries which had strongly opposed the rule
during its creation, but have since spent billions implementing it, are now
demanding that the rule continue to be applied to foreign refineries. From a business
perspective, they argue, the WTO's sovereignty threat undermines their ability to
make business plans. <p>

<p>

The WTO ruling limits future use of WTO defenses on natural resources and health. <p>

There are several limited exceptions to WTO rules for certain domestic laws that
conserve natural resources or protect human, animal or plant life. This ruling
drastically narrowed the exception for measures "relating to the conservation of
exhaustible natural resources." This exception had been viewed as more widely
applicable. Unlike other GATT exceptions, it does not requires a defending party to
prove its domestic law is "necessary," a term interpreted in GATT to mean the "least
trade restrictive" option regardless of political, economic or other feasibility concerns.
This WTO tribunal ignores the WTO rules to conclude the U.S. does not qualify for
the exception because it has not proved the rule was "necessary" for 
conservation.  As
well, the tribunal applies a very strict "necessary" test in relation to the exception for
measures "necessary to protect the health and life of humans, plants and animals."
The tribunal describes the least trade restrictive test in a manner that makes it
logically impossible to prove: a defending party must prove the negative, that
somewhere, somehow, a less trade restrictive measure does <u>not</u> exist.<p>

<p>

If implemented, the ruling would result in dirtier U.S. air quality.<p>

The result of U.S. implementation of the WTO ruling would be dirtier air.
Implementation would allow the $150 million annually in Venezuelan gasoline too
dirty to now enter into U.S. markets. Interestingly, in the years during which the
current rule has been in force, Venezuelan imports of gasoline to the U.S have
increased. If Venezuela were excused from meeting the reformulated gasoline
standard, an additional $150 million annually of gasoline would be allowed into the
U.S. which is more highly contaminated with polluting elements called "aromatics."<p>

<p>

The WTO's secretive tribunal second guessed the best way to implement U.S. policy.<p>

The ruling vividly demonstrates what occurs when the WTO authorizes foreign
bureaucrats with no stake in promoting the best interests of the U.S. nor expertise in
U.S. health  or environmental goals to oversee implementation of U.S. domestic
policy. The ruling states: "...WTO Members were free to set their own environmental
objectives, but they were bound to implement those objectives through measures
consistent with its [WTO's} provisions..."      WTO Panel Report on Venezuela and Brazil's Challenge of the U.S. reformulated Gasoline Rules,
January 16, 1996, p. 46. (Hereinafter "Panel Report<u></u>.<u></u>") This is the WTO rule of "say what you
want, but do only what we say." The ruling subordinates the many real world
difficulties of policy-making to the WTO's imperative of trade uber alles -- putting
trade expansion as the primary goal always. Thus, dismissed as unfortunate are the
grounds presented by the U.S. as to why the U.S. EPA created this rule. The WTO
tribunal engages in second-guessing, noting that the U.S. could have required all
refineries to meet the same contamination baseline. However, during the rule's
creation through the Administrative Procedure Act's democratic processes, this very
option was ruled out. It was determined to have unacceptable costs: causing major
disruptions in gasoline production and thus shortages and consumer price hikes. It
was argued to be a nation security problem. Also, Clean Air Act opponents argued
that a uniform standard would necessitate a very long phase-in and a significantly
lower standard than what could be achieved using other methods. The tribunal also
advised that the U.S. could have allowed every refiner to set its own baseline.
Interestingly, U.S. refineries had urged for just that. This method would have kept
foreign-refined gasoline entirely out of U.S. markets. Foreign refiners have not been
required to keep the detailed data required of U.S. refineries that would have been
needed to calculate individual baseline. When EPA suggested that foreign refineries
could try to provide data to set their own baseline in a proposed 1994 reformulated
gas rule change, Venezuela and Brazil did not support the proposal. They argued the
data requirements were too cumbersome. Thus, the EPA used its judgement to craft a
compromise allowing some flexibility for refineries with data to set their own
baseline. The EPA concluded it could not ensure reliability of foreign data nor did it
have foreign police powers to sanctions falsified foreign data. Thus, U.S. refineries
with the needed data could set individual baselines. U.S. refineries that had not been
operating for six months (and thus did not have good data) and  foreign refineries
were given a statutory contamination level. That level was the actual average of all of
the refineries for which data were avialable, ensuring that foreign refiners as a group
were treated identically to domestic refineriers as a group.  <p>

<p>

The U.S. has only 3 options to the WTO ruling: Appeal to an internal WTO review
board, change the rule or pay $150 million annually to Venezuela in trade sanctions.<p>

The WTO, not the U.S. policy needs to be changed. Although appeals are limited to
an internal review board, the U.S. must appeal this case because it establishes
dangerous precedents which could be used to attack other U.S. conservation and
environmental laws. As well, the U.S. would be setting a bad precedent in simply
accepting this far ranging ruling which is packed with extraneous, ad hoc rule-making on issues that this case does not raise and that could be used against a wide
range of other domestic policies far beyond environmental and health issues. As a
policy matter, the U.S. must draw a line: international trade law cannot be made by
secretive panels on an ad hoc basis. This ruling bristles with out of context quotes
pulled from past GATT cases used to substantiate points the panel seems to have
created out of whole cloth.<p>

<p>

In trying to claim some victory, the U.S. trade office has bragged that it won a real
victory in getting the WTO to consider clean air as an exhaustible natural resource!<p>

The fact that the Clinton Administration declared victory in the WTO's
decision to consider air a natural resource is a devastating indictment of
the WTO's antiquated view of the world. It seems inconceivable that the
U.S. would have agreed to submit its domestic health and environmental
laws to review by such a backwards organization. The notion that any
international agency would question whether clean air is a renewable
natural resource would be comical, except the WTO has the power of trade
sanctions to push its backwards notions of the world into nations'
domestic policies. <hr> <a

<p><hr>

                          <a name="intro">INTRODUCTION<p>

<p>

	The United States has brought to the World Trade Organization's (WTO) dispute settlement
panel a challenge to the European Union's (EU) attempt to protect its consumers from the risks
associated with eating meat from animals that have been treated with growth-promoting
hormones.  The United States claims that the EU's ban on trade in such meat is a discriminatory
barrier to trade that is not justified by a legitimate health-protective purpose.  However, as
described in detail below, the EU's ban is not discriminatory because it is applied equally to
domestic and foreign products.  More importantly, the ban is a legitimate exercise of the EU's
right to protect its people against a health risk and, as such, is acceptable despite any effect it
might have on trade.<p>

	In light of scientific evidence that residues of growth hormones in meat may harm human health,
the EU has determined that its consumers should be completely protected from this risk. 
Although science is an appropriate consideration with respect to the identification of risk,
determining the appropriate response to that risk is a political decision.  For that reason,
customary international law and GATT protect the EU's right to choose its appropriate level of
protection from a risk to human health.  The United States cannot, therefore, use a challenge
before the WTO panel to force the EU to change its chosen level of protection.  Thus, the United
States challenge is essentially a claim that the measure chosen by the EU to achieve the zero-risk
level of protection is more trade-restrictive than necessary.  <p>

	The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement)
states that a measure is not more trade restrictive than necessary unless there is another,
less-restrictive measure that achieves the chosen level of protection.  Therefore, to prove that the
EU's ban is more trade-restrictive than necessary, the burden is on the United States to
demonstrate that a less-restrictive measure that would achieve the same level of protection is
reasonably available.  The United States has not done so.  To the contrary, the following analysis
of the EU ban demonstrates that the ban is consistent with customary international law and
GATT.<p>

                           <a name="back">BACKGROUND<p>

<a name="growth">Growth Hormones<p>

	For several decades, meat producers have routinely treated livestock with natural and synthetic
hormones to facilitate rapid growth.  The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
has approved six hormones for use in increasing the rate of growth of beef cattle.  These are the
three naturally occurring hormones estradiol-17, progesterone and testosterone, and the three
synthetic hormones trenbolone acetate, zeranol and melengestrol acetate (MGA).  With the
exception of MGA, these hormones are approved for administration in the form of pellets that are
implanted in the ears of cattle.  MGA is approved for administration in cattle feed.  In 1995, 63
percent of all cattle in the United States and 90 percent of cattle raised in US feedlots were
treated with growth hormones.<p>

	As described in greater detail below, the use of hormones to promote growth in livestock results
in residues of these hormones in meat from such livestock.  These residues consist of levels or
types of hormones that do not naturally occur in meat.<p>

	Hormones, including those used to promote growth in livestock, are known to be related to
cancer in laboratory animals and in humans.  As documented in detail below, there is extensive
scientific data that consumption of hormones causes cancer in laboratory animals and, in some
cases, in humans.  In addition, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has noted that
hormones may magnify the effects of other carcinogens:<p>

	Hormones may be essential to carcinogenesis by preparing the background on which tumours
may ultimately arise . . . .  Hormones may stimulate carcinogenesis by providing a background
for subsequent tumorigenesis by chemical, physical or viral agents or by promoting the growth
and metastasis of tumours once they have been initiated, or in a variety of other ways.<p>

Moreover, the growth hormones used in livestock cause estrogenic effects, including reduction in
male human fertility, that are approximately 10,000 times higher than some pesticides that have
long been recognized to be extremely dangerous to humans because of their estrogenic effects.<p>

	The risks associated with consumption of growth hormones are not only theoretical.  From 1979
to 1981, approximately 3,000 Puerto Rican infants and children experienced premature sexual
development and developed ovarian cysts.  The victims were found to have elevated levels of
estrogen and the synthetic hormone zeranol in their blood and their symptoms were determined
to have been caused by the consumption of meat products found to contain elevated amounts of
estrogen.  The same meat products were also associated with a contemporaneous increase in the
rates of uterine and ovarian cancers in adult women.<p>

<a name="eu">The EU Ban<p>

	Another incident resulting from the presence of hormones in meat led to the European Union to
ban the use of growth hormones.  In 1980, the presence of the hormone diethylstilbene (DES) in
meat used in baby food resulted in claims that infants that ate the food developed breasts and that
infant girls began menstruating.  As European consumers became aware of the risks associated
with consuming hormone-treated meat, demand for meats and meat products declined.<p>

	In response to these events, the EU instituted a ban, effective on July 31, 1982, on the use in
European livestock farming of substances having hormonal action and on the sale of animals
treated with such substances or meat from such animals.  The ban was based on the concern that
the use of such substances "may be dangerous for consumers."  The ban did not, however, apply
to the use of estradiol-17, progesterone, testosterone, trenbolone acetate or zeranol.  Instead, the
Directive provided that whatever national regulations concerning these five hormones were
already in place, including those that banned their use, would remain in place pending further
study.<p>

	In 1985, after further study of the five hormones left unregulated by Council Directive 81/602,
the Council determined that assessments of the effect of these five hormones on human health
"var[ied]" and decided to extend its ban on the use of hormones to fatten livestock to all
hormones, including these five.  In addition, because "it would be difficult to be certain of correct
operation of the [ban] as a whole if animals so treated [with growth hormones] and the meat from
such animals were to be traded," the Council banned intra-European trade in hormone-treated
meat and, effective January 1, 1988, prohibited "the importation from third countries of animals
and of meat from animals to which have been administered in any way whatsoever."  The ban
thus reflects the EU's decision to expose its consumers to zero risk from exposure to residues of
hormones that differ in any way from those naturally occurring in meat, either in the form of
increased amounts of natural hormones or residues of synthetic hormones.<p>

<a name="codex">The Codex Alimentarius Commission's Decision Concerning the 
Use of Growth Hormones in Livestock Production<p>

	The Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex), which was established in 1962 by the World
Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
"to facilitate the world trade in foods [through] internationally accepted standards," has addressed
the use of several growth promoters in raising livestock.  In 1995, Codex voted to permit
estradiol-17, progesterone and testosterone, to be used as growth-promoters without any
limitation.  Codex also voted to adopt certain maximum residue limits (MRLs) for the synthetic
growth-promoting hormones trenbolone acetate and zeranol.  Codex has not reached any
conclusion concerning the use of MGA.<p>

	There is reason to question whether Codex's action with respect to growth hormones established
"internationally accepted standards."  Codex has traditionally adopted standards by consensus,
which indicates that the standards are acceptable to all of the countries that participate in the
work of Codex.  Codex's adoption of the standards for growth hormones, however, was far from
consensual.  In 1991, the first time Codex considered adopting standards for the use of growth
hormones, it was unable to reach consensus.  Instead, 28 of 37 participating countries objected to
adoption of the standards and forced a vote on the issue.  Only 12 countries voted to adopt the
standards, and the matter was postponed.  <p>

	Codex considered the issue again in 1995.  Although several countries were of the opinion that
additional study was necessary before reaching a decision, a vote to postpone a decision on the
standards pending further study was defeated by 31 to 28, with 5 countries abstaining.  Unable to
reach consensus concerning the proposed standards themselves, Codex was forced to a vote in
which 33 countries voted in favor of adopting the standards, 29 voted against and 7 abstained.<p>

	Thus, the standards for growth hormones adopted by Codex were considered appropriate by less
than a majority of the countries participating in the decision (and only slightly more than half of
the voting countries).  A nearly split Codex vote hardly indicates a general consensus concerning
a purportedly scientific question.  To the contrary, the need for a vote and the close results clearly
show that there was significant doubt concerning the appropriateness of the Codex standards for
these hormones.  <p>

	The Codex experience with growth hormones demonstrates the fundamentally political nature of
taking action based on conflicting scientific evidence concerning a potentially harmful substance. 
As William Ruckelshaus, former Administrator of the US EPA, has stated, "In science, the
majority does not rule, as the history of science amply demonstrates."  However, turning science
into action is an inherently political endeavor.  Conflicting evidence must be weighed and risks
and benefits must be balanced before action can be taken.  These are political decisions that must
be made by governments, which are responsible to the people who are directly affected by the
outcome of the decisions.  Codex, which is an international body purporting to use science to
advance trade is ill-equipped to make such political decisions, as the failure to reach a consensus
concerning growth hormones makes evident.  Nevertheless, the United States argues that the EU
should be required to abide by the Codex standards.<p>

	Fortunately, as is described in detail below, international law gives countries the right to make
such political decisions by allowing them discretion in selecting their appropriate level of
protection against an identified risk.  If a country selects a level of protection higher than that
provided by standards established by Codex, customary international law and the SPS Agreement
allow it to implement more stringent measures than the Codex standards would provide.  To
make Codex-established standards a norm from which countries could not deviate would allow
Codex to make political judgments that must instead be made at the national level.  Neither
customary international law nor the SPS Agreement permits such a result.<p>

<a name="eu2">The EU's 1995 Scientific Conference<p>

	In November 1995, the EU convened the Scientific Conference on Growth Promotion in Meat
Production.  The Conference examined the available scientific evidence concerning the use of
growth hormones and found that the limitations on the use of such hormones established in
countries using them (such as the United States) and by various international committees (such as
Codex), "are a reasonable safeguard of public health."<p>

	It is important to note that the EU Scientific Conference's conclusion was made in conjunction
with its recognition of numerous risks and uncertainties associated with human consumption of
growth hormones.  Although it concluded that certain growth hormones present no risk to
consumers, scientific evidence described in detail below demonstrates that this conclusion was
based on several mistaken assumptions and ignored important elements of risk analysis.<p>

	In light of these facts, and consistent with the Conference's overall conclusion that compliance
with certain limitations on the use of growth hormones would provide a "reasonable safeguard of
public health," the Conference's conclusion is legitimate only as a statement that, despite possible
risks to human health from consumption of hormone-treated meat, the limitations established by
national and international organizations are sufficient to attain a certain level of protection --
"reasonable safety" -- from those risks.  This level of protection is different from the one chosen
by the EU -- zero risk.<p>

	The risks and uncertainties identified by the Scientific Conference, as well as a substantial body
of other scientific evidence described below, indicate that the limitations established by Codex
and the FDA do not provide absolute protection against such risks.  Legal analysis of the EU ban
on trade in hormone-treated meat demonstrates that the ban is a legitimate means of achieving a
zero-risk level of protection against the risks identified by the Scientific Conference, risks that
are well supported by scientific evidence.<p>

                    <a name="legal">LEGAL ANALYSIS OF THE BAN<p>

	A stated purpose of GATT is to facilitate trade by reducing or eliminating tariffs.  Because
nontariff measures may also interfere with trade, GATT attempts to prevent such measures from
being a substitute for tariffs.  The core principle of such prevention is that imported products
must not be treated less favorably than domestic ones.  GATT enforces this national treatment
principle by prohibiting discriminatory treatment of imported products.  The EU ban on trade in
hormone-treated meat does not discriminate against foreign products.  Rather, it is a legitimate
measure intended to protect the health of consumers from risks associated with residues of
growth hormones in meat. <p>

	As described in greater detail below, the customary international law norm of the precautionary
principle permits countries to take steps to protect human health.  Consistent with this principle,
GATT allows countries to implement measures genuinely intended to protect against risks to
human health even if those measures constitute a barrier to trade.  The Agreement on the
Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) is intended to distinguish
genuine sanitary measures from those whose only purpose is to disguise attempts to protect
domestic products from foreign competition.<p>

	 In accordance with international law and the SPS Agreement, the EU chose to subject
consumers to zero risk from hormone residues in meat.  Scientific evidence supports the EU's
decision to achieve a higher level of protection than would be provided by measures such as the
standards approved by Codex or the United States.  The EU implemented its ban as a means of
achieving its level of protection.  Because no less restrictive measures are reasonably available to
provide zero risk from hormone residues in meat, the ban is permitted by customary international
law and the SPS Agreement even if it restricts international trade.<p>

<a name="eu3">I.	THE EU BAN ON TRADE IN HORMONE-TREATED MEAT IS NOT 
DISCRIMINATORY AND THEREFORE DOES NOT VIOLATE GATT<p>

	Through GATT, members of the World Trade Organization have taken steps to reduce barriers to
trade and eliminate "discriminatory treatment in international commerce."  To this end, GATT
contains several requirements to prevent discriminatory treatment of foreign goods and services. 
The basic prevention of discrimination is provided by the requirement that the products of any
member country "be accorded treatment no less favourable than that accorded to like products of
national origin in respect of all laws, regulations and requirements affecting their internal sale,
offering for sale, purchase, transportation, distribution or use."  Products imported from a
member country must also be accorded the same treatment as products from any other member
country.<p>

	One GATT panel has explicitly distinguished discriminatory measures from nondiscriminatory
measures implemented on a nondiscriminatory basis, such as labelling requirements, ingredient
disclosure regulations, and advertising bans, and stated that such nondiscriminatory measures
would be consistent with Article III(4).  In addition, the panel stated that Thailand could regulate
the overall supply or price of cigarettes to lessen cigarette use as long as it afforded imported
cigarettes no less favorable treatment than domestic ones.<p>

	As in the Thai cigarette case, the EU ban applies to trade in all hormone-treated animals and
meat; it makes no distinction between foreign and domestic products or between US products
and any other foreign products.  The ban is therefore a completely neutral measure and is
consistent with the anti-discrimination requirements of Articles I and III.  <p>

	GATT provides further protection against discrimination against foreign products and services
through Article XI, which provides:<p>

	No prohibitions or restrictions . . . shall be instituted or maintained by any contracting party on
the importation of any product of the territory of any other contracting party.<p>

	The United States admits that the EU ban is not a restriction on importation, but is instead an
internal measure that, in the case of imports, is enforced at the border.  This admission supports
the conclusion that the EU ban is applied neutrally with respect to domestic and foreign animals
and meat and is therefore not a discriminatory measure that violates Article III.  Moreover, even
if the EU ban were considered a restriction on imports, it would be permitted by international law
and GATT which specifically permit a country to take trade restrictive measures intended to
protect human health.  <p>

<a name="eu4>II.	THE EU BAN ON TRADE IN HORMONE-TREATED MEAT IS SUPPORTED BY
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND GATT AS A LEGITIMATE SANITARY MEASURE<p>

<p>

	<a name="cust">A.	Customary International Law: The Precautionary 
Principle<p>

	Under customary international law, countries have the right to regulate activities and substances
that may be harmful to human health even if no conclusive or overwhelming evidence is
available as to whether the activity actually causes that harm, the precise degree of harm or the
process by which it occurs.  This principle, called the precautionary principle, has been a part of
domestic and international law for several decades and has become a "broadly accepted basis for
international action."<p>

	The precautionary principle is based on the premise that science does not always provide the
information or insights necessary to take protective action effectively or in a timely manner and
that undesirable and potentially irreversible effects may result if action is not taken until science
does provide such insights.  Because of its focus on the potentially serious implications of
inaction, the precautionary principle "generally require[s] a greater obligation to exercise
precaution in proportion to the risk of irreversible permanent damage to human life or health." 
Carcinogens like growth hormones present precisely this situation, because cancer is frequently
irreversible and possible cures are almost always extremely costly.<p>

	The importance of the precautionary principle is demonstrated by numerous instances in which
precautionary action by governments prevented serious harm.  For example, by taking
precautionary steps with respect to possible risks from the use of thalidomide, the United States
avoided a potentially disastrous epidemic of birth defects.  <p>

	In the 1950s, thalidomide was discovered to be a very effective sedative and anti-emetic.  Tests
in laboratory animals showed no negative effects.  As a result, thalidomide became a favorite
non-prescription sleep-aid in West Germany and elsewhere, even being sold in a liquid form for
children, and was used by pregnant women to prevent nausea.  In subsequent years, however,
some long-term users of the drug began complaining of neurological problems.  <p>

	At about the same time, FDA was considering an application for approval of thalidomide for use
in the United States.  An FDA scientist familiar with the fact that drugs can affect fetuses and
newborns completely differently from adults learned about the reports of possible side-effects
associated with long-term use of thalidomide and became concerned over the proposed use of the
drug to prevent nausea during pregnancy.  She therefore requested more data to show that the
drug was safe during pregnancy.  Before the manufacturer of the drug could provide such
information, reports arrived from Europe noting an alarming increase in the number of babies
born with deformities and a Canadian doctor reported that such effects might result from the use
of thalidomide during pregnancy.  Although the precise mechanism by which thalidomide
affected fetuses was not understood -- in fact, the mechanism remained unclear into the 1980s --
FDA took a precautionary approach and refused to approve the use of thalidomide in the United
States.  <p>

	Thalidomide is estimated to have been responsible for deformities in more than 10,000 babies in
the countries in which it was approved.  Through its precautionary action, the FDA prevented a
similarly devastating experience in the United States.<p>

	The dangers of failing to take precautionary action are not simply hypothetical.  The case of DES
is a perfect example.  When DES was first approved by the FDA for use as a growth promoter in
meat animals, scientific evidence demonstrated that the hormone caused cancer in laboratory
animals.  Use of the hormone was nevertheless approved on the basis of a determination that
there would be no unacceptable risk to humans as long as no DES residue could be measured in
meat from animals treated with DES.  In 1960, Dr. Thomas Carney, vice-president of Eli Lilly &amp;
Company, a major DES manufacturer, and chairman of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers'
Association's Committee for the Study of Carcinogenic Substances, testified before the US
Congress in opposition to legislation that would prohibit the use of carcinogenic food additives. 
Dr. Carney testified that<p>

	DES's safety in man and animals has been fully established for years . . . .  Under the Delaney
amendment, this completely safe and very valuable chemical could never have been developed
and introduced in animal feeds and its many benefits to farmers and consumers would never have
been realized . . . .  I should emphasize that there is no detectible residue in beef or sheep which
have been fed [DES] under recommended conditions; so it cannot cause any side effects.<p>

	In the early 1970s, the daughters of women treated with DES during pregnancy began developing
a rare form of vaginal cancer.  This caused FDA to reevaluate the evidence concerning the safety
of DES and to determine that the drug presented a risk even at residue levels below the smallest
detectable amounts.  This finding eventually led to a ban on the use of DES in the United States. 
However, the failure to take precautionary action in response to evidence that DES caused cancer
in laboratory animals resulted in irreparable injury to thousands of people exposed to the drug.<p>

	As the examples of thalidomide and DES demonstrate, the precautionary principle is essential if
governments are to be able to fulfill their responsibility to protect against harm to human health. 
Moreover, as a rule of international law, the precautionary principle should guide the
interpretation of other agreements relating to the protection of human health.  The Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties provides that treaties are to be interpreted in light of "any
relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties".  Therefore, the
GATT rules relating to the protection of human health should be interpreted as consistently as
possible with the precautionary principle.  Fortunately, as described in the following sections,
both the SPS Agreement and Article XX(b) of GATT support the right of a country to take
precautionary health-protective measures by choosing the level of protection it determines to an
appropriate response to a given risk.<p>

	<a name="sps">B.	The SPS Agreement and Article XX(b)<p>

	GATT recognizes the right of countries to take measures to protect human health even though
such measures may also restrict international trade.  Article XX(b) of GATT and the SPS
Agreement both protect a country's right to take steps that are "necessary for the protection of
human, animal or plant life or health" even if those steps interfere with trade in a manner that
would otherwise be inconsistent with the GATT.  As one GATT dispute panel has stated, by
creating such exceptions to the general trade rules, the member nations have made clear that
countries may "give priority to human health over trade liberalization."  The Thai cigarette panel
recognized the right of countries to take measures to protect against risks to human health even
though such measures might have the effect of restricting trade.<p>

	Simply invoking health risks, however, does not relieve a country of the obligations of the
national treatment principle of Article III(4).  Therefore, GATT includes several provisions
intended to distinguish between measures that are genuinely intended to protect public health and
those that constitute arbitrary or unjustified discrimination or disguised restrictions on trade.  <p>

	A health-protective measure that is discriminatory -- i.e., one that, unlike the EU ban on
hormone-treated meat, applies to domestic products or services differently than to foreign ones --
is nevertheless legitimate as long as it does not discriminate "arbitrarily or unjustifiably."  If the
discriminatory treatment is predicated on a genuine need to protect human health and is applied
to all countries equally, the discrimination is unlikely to be considered arbitrary or unjustified. 
Thus, even if the EU ban were discriminatory, it would be legitimate because it is predicated on a
genuine need to protect against the risk to human health posed by residues of growth hormones in
meat and is applied equally to all countries.<p>

	As previously explained, however, the EU ban applies equally to domestic and foreign products
and therefore is not discriminatory.  Such a non-discriminatory measure is legitimate under
GATT as long as it is not "applied in a manner which would constitute a disguised restriction on
international trade."  This requirement is not intended to restrict the right of countries to take
legitimate protective measures, but to avoid the "abuse or illegitimate use of the exceptions [such
as for sanitary measures] to substantive [GATT] rules."<p>

	The United States argues that the EU's ban is a disguised restriction on international trade simply
because the EU has recognized that the ban has effects that restrict trade in a manner that benefits
the EU.  Specifically, the United States points to the EU's recognition that "the ban would help
reduce surplus supplies of meat in the EC and lower the cost of the EC's Common Agricultural
Policy."  However, the mere fact that a sanitary measure has effects that restrict trade does not
make it a "disguised restriction on international trade," as the United States claims.  To the
contrary, the entire purpose of the requirements of the SPS Agreement is to distinguish between
legitimate and illegitimate measures that restrict trade -- those that have a legitimate
health-protective purpose as defined by the Agreement are permitted despite their resulting trade
restrictions and those that do not are prohibited.  <p>

	If the mere existence of a trade-restrictive effect were enough to label a measure a disguised
restriction on trade, the detailed requirements of the SPS Agreement would have no meaning.  As
noted above, the Thai cigarette panel recognized that necessary sanitary measures do not
necessarily constitute a disguised restriction on trade simply because they interfere with trade.  In
particular, the panel acknowledged that an across-the-board advertising ban might have a
disproportionate impact on new foreign suppliers that did not yet have a share of the market, but
noted any such effect was unavoidable under the ban, which was a legitimate sanitary measure.<p>

	As the Thai cigarette case demonstrates, as long as the EU ban is a legitimate sanitary measure
under the SPS Agreement, it is not a disguised restriction on trade simply because the EU may
obtain other benefits from the ban.  The United States has taken the same position, stating that,
under the SPS Agreement,<p>

	[a]s long as a food safety measure is consistent with the other provisions of the SPS Agreement,
it is unlikely that it would constitute a "disguised restriction on trade."  The other provisions of
the Agreement -- such as the requirement to base SPS measures on scientific principles -- are
designed to ensure that measures are truly intended to protect food safety. . . .  [I]t is important to
note that the mere fact that a food safety measure may have a disproportionate effect on
importers is not sufficient to qualify it as a disguised restriction on trade.<p>

	The USTR explained its interpretation by using an example that is analogous to the EU's ban on
trade in hormone-treated meat.  The USTR stated that a ban on listeria-contaminated cheese --
which would affect imported cheese more than domestic cheese because the types of cheese most
prone to listeria contamination are imported -- would not constitute a disguised restriction on
trade because it "applies equally to US and foreign cheese producers."  Likewise, even if the EU's
ban on trade in hormone-treated meat affects imported meat more than domestic meat, it is a
legitimate health protective measure that does not violate GATT as long as it satisfies the
requirements of the SPS Agreement.<p>

	<a name="euro">C.	The European Union Legitimately Selected Zero Risk as Its 
Appropriate Level of Protection
Against the Risks of Exposure to Growth-Promoting Hormones<p>

	When a nation identifies a potential risk to human health from an activity or a substance, it must
decide whether and to what extent to take steps to protect against that risk.  While science plays
an important role in identifying the existence of a risk, the decision concerning the appropriate
response to that risk is purely political.  It requires weighing the evidence, which may be
conflicting, that the risk exists.  More significantly, it requires weighing how much the citizens of
the country fear the particular risk and how much, if at all, they value the benefits that the activity
or substance provides.  <p>

	By balancing concern about the risk against the value of the activity or substance, the government
of a country can determine what amount of that risk is acceptable to its citizens and, therefore,
what level of protection against that risk it must strive to attain.  This decision goes to the heart
of what governments do -- determining a course of action based on the fears and values of
citizens.  Because of the essentially political nature of the choice of a level of protection against
risk, customary international law and the SPS Agreement protect the right of countries to make
this choice.<p>

	The SPS Agreement explicitly protects a country's freedom to choose the level of protection it
considers appropriate.  The Preamble to the Agreement states that the Agreement is not intended
to require countries "to change their appropriate level of protection of human, animal or plant life
or health."  An amendment to the final draft of the preamble reinforced this important principle. 
Although earlier drafts of the Agreement expressed an unqualified desire to harmonize national
SPS measures, the final draft was amended to emphasize that such harmonization was not
intended to require countries "to change their appropriate level of protection of human, animal or
plant life or health."  This amendment reflected the agreement of the negotiators of the SPS
Agreement that<p>

	each government is free to choose the levels it considers appropriate for the protection of human,
animal or plant life or health and of the environment and that no country should be prevented
from taking measures necessary to achieve those levels subject to the requirement, inter alia, that
the measures are in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.<p>

	The freedom of each country to choose its level of protection is emphasized in the Agreement's
definition of "appropriate level of protection":<p>

	The level of protection deemed appropriate by the country establishing [the SPS] measure to
protect human, animal or plant life or health within its territory.  Note:  Many parties otherwise
refer to this concept as the "acceptable level of risk."<p>

	Pursuant to its right to do so, the European Union has selected zero risk as its appropriate level of
risk with respect to exposure to residues of growth hormones in meat.  The United States' own
interpretation of the SPS Agreement supports the EU's choice of its level of protection.  The
United States has recognized that the SPS Agreement's definition of appropriate level of
protection<p>

	explicitly affirms the right of each government to choose its levels of protection, including a
"zero risk" level if it so chooses.  A government may establish its level of protection by any
means available under its law, including by referendum.  In the end, the choice of the appropriate
level of protection is a societal value judgment.  The Agreement imposes no requirement to
establish a scientific basis for the chosen level of protection because the choice is not a scientific
judgment.<p>

	The United States argues that the EU has not really chosen a zero risk level of protection because
the EU's ban permits the use of natural growth hormones for therapeutic purposes.  This is
incorrect, however, because the ban explicitly regulates the therapeutic use of hormones to
ensure that such use will not result in hormone residues that differ from those that occur naturally
in meat.<p>

	The hormones approved for therapeutic uses are those that occur naturally in meat -- estradiol,
progesterone and testosterone.  Hormones used for therapeutic treatment may only be
administered by a veterinarian.  This ensures that the hormones are not administered improperly. 
Most significantly, the animals to which the hormones are administered for therapeutic purposes
are to be clearly marked and may not be slaughtered before the end of a waiting period.  This
practice ensures that any meat from animals receiving therapeutic treatment with natural
hormones will not contain residues of hormones that differ from the hormones that are naturally
present in the meat.  These requirements ensure that the therapeutic administration of naturally
occurring growth hormones does not contravene the EU's objective of achieving zero risk from
hormone residues that differ from those that naturally occur in meat.<p>

	The United States has not claimed that the EU should permit the importation of meat that has
been therapeutically treated with hormones pursuant to the regulations described above or that it
has such meat available for export to the European Union.  Instead of limiting its challenge to
therapeutically treated meat, the United States has challenged the EU ban in its entirety, arguing
that the EU should be required to allow imports of meat from animals treated with hormones to
promote growth.  As demonstrated below, using hormones to promote growth results in residues
of hormones that pose risks to human health.  These risks are not present when hormones are
used therapeutically under the restrictions imposed by the European Union.  Therefore, the EU's
ban, including the restrictions on the therapeutic use of hormones, is consistent with the EU's
choice of zero-risk as its level of protection.<p>

	The SPS Agreement states that, in choosing their appropriate level of protection, countries
"should . . . take into account the objective of minimizing negative trade effects."  An early draft
of the Agreement required countries to consider the effect on trade of the level of protection they
chose, but the countries rejected a mandatory requirement in favor of a hortatory one.  The use of
the non-mandatory language reflects the Agreement's emphasis on countries' right to take the
steps necessary to choose the appropriate level of protection against risk and the political, not
economic, nature of that choice.  Although the EU could minimize the effect on trade of its
concern over the risks associated with growth hormones by selecting a lower level of protection,
it cannot be required to do so when it has determined that considers a higher level of protection is
appropriate.<p>

	The SPS Agreement thus requires that the EU's choice of a level of protection be respected.  The
WTO panel should not allow the United States to use a challenge under the SPS Agreement to
force the EU to accept the United States' chosen level of protection, which is lower than the level
that the EU has determined to be appropriate.  To do so would not only be inconsistent with the
SPS Agreement, it would make that Agreement an obstacle to a country's right to take
precautionary sanitary measures.  This would violate international law, which requires that the
SPS Agreement be interpreted as consistently as possible with the precautionary principle.<p>

	<a name="use">D.	There is Ample Evidence of Risk for the EU to Maintain a 
Higher Level of Protection than Codex's Standards Would Provide<p>

	The EU Scientific Conference recognized certain risks and uncertainties associated with human
consumption of hormone treated meat.  These risks are supported by a substantial body of other
scientific evidence.  Despite this evidence, the EU Scientific Conference nevertheless determined
that the limitations on the use of growth hormones established by certain domestic and
international bodies, such as Codex, are a "reasonable safeguard of public health."  "Reasonable
safety" is a level of protection that is lower than the EU's zero risk level of protection.  <p>

	If the EU had wanted to obtain less than absolute protection against these risks, it might have
decided to do so by applying the standards adopted by Codex.  However, the risks associated
with consumption of hormone-treated meat that were recognized by the Scientific Conference
and are supported by scientific evidence indicate that the limitations established by Codex and
the FDA cannot provide absolute protection against such risks.  The EU has chosen to achieve a
higher level of protection than those standards would achieve, i.e., a zero-risk level of protection. 
Therefore, it has used a measure that is intended to achieve that level of protection -- a total ban
on trade in hormone-treated meat.<p>

	The SPS Agreement is not intended to require "the upward or downward harmonisation of
technical regulations or standards as a result of international standardisation activities." 
Therefore, as the United States has recognized, the choice of a measure that is different from
international standards "does not in itself, create any adverse presumption concerning that
measure."  To this end, the Agreement explicitly recognizes the right of countries to <p>

	introduce or maintain [SPS] measures which result in a higher level of [SPS] protection than
would be achieved by measures based on the relevant international standards . . . if there is a
scientific justification, or as a consequence of the level of protection a Member determines to be
appropriate in accordance with the relevant provisions of paragraphs 16 through 23.<p>

	The SPS Agreement explains that there is a scientific justification for adopting a measure
resulting in a higher level of protection than afforded by international standards if<p>

	on the basis of an examination and evaluation of available scientific information in conformity
with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, a Member determines that the relevant
international standards, guidelines or recommendations are not sufficient to achieve its
appropriate level of protection.<p>

	Thus, under the requirements of the SPS Agreement, the first step in analyzing an SPS measure
that provides a higher level of protection than international standards is to evaluate the available
scientific information through a risk assessment.  If the scientific evidence shows that a risk
exists, the country may implement measures necessary to achieve its chosen level of protection
against that risk.<p>

		<a name="meat">1.	The Use of Growth Hormones in Livestock Presents a Real 
Health Risk Justifying Protective Measures<p>

  	Under the SPS Agreement, risk assessment is "the evaluation of the potential adverse effects on
human . . . health arising from the presence of additives, contaminants [or] toxins . . . in food."<p>

	The United States contends that "presumably, the level of any risk, if one could have been
identified, would have been related to the level of residue" of hormones in meat.  However, the
SPS Agreement does not make any distinction based on levels of risk.  The Agreement's focus on
assessing the risk of the "presence" of additives, instead of a certain amount or concentration of
additives, makes clear that risk assessment is intended to determine whether such risk exists at
any amount or concentration.  Therefore, the determination that a particular additive constitutes a
risk does not depend on the amount of the additive required to cause harm or the amount of harm
likely to be caused.  <p>

	The United States position in its submission is inconsistent with its own previously stated
position:<p>

		Importantly, "risk assessment" as used in the Agreement is not limited to quantitative risk
assessment, which is a particular type of risk assessment used to evaluate the potential for
carcinogenesis.<p>

	The USTR reiterated this point while defending the Delaney Clause as a measure that satisfies
the requirements of the SPS agreement.  Under the Delaney Clause, the United States prohibits
residues in processed foods of additives that concentrate in such foods and that have been "found
to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal."  Although the USTR recognized that "some
scientists might argue that small amounts of [certain chemicals banned under the clause] pose
very little cancer risk," it stated that the Delaney Clause is nevertheless <p>

	completely consistent with the SPS Agreement.  Congress' decision that U.S. consumers should
not be subjected to any risk from cancer-causing chemicals in foods is a value judgment that is
fully protected under the Uruguay Round [SPS] Agreement.<p>

	Determining that a risk exists also does not require proving that the substance or process in
question will cause harm.  This is clear from the definition of "risk" -- "exposure to the chance of
injury or loss."  Therefore, the possibility that a substance or process may cause harm is sufficient
to permit a country to institute measures to protect against that risk.  The United States has
agreed with this interpretation:  "The determination that a particular substance poses a risk of
cancer is a scientific determination, based on an evaluation of the potential for a substance to
induce cancer."  In other words, with respect to hormone-treated meat, the EU may choose a level
of protection and implement measures to achieve that level of protection unless there is
absolutely no possibility that the use of such hormones could be a risk to human health.  <p>

	Defining risk assessment in this manner is consistent with the precautionary principle.  If SPS
measures could only be instituted to protect against risks that were absolutely certain to occur or
that would occur only upon exposure to a certain amount of a substance, nations would not be
able to implement protective measures where there was conflicting or incomplete scientific
evidence of possible harm.<p>

	In assessing risk, the SPS Agreement requires countries to take into account<p>

		available scientific evidence; relevant processes and production methods; relevant inspection,
sampling and testing methods; prevalence of specific diseases or pests; existence of pest- or
disease-free areas; relevant ecological and environmental conditions; and quarantine or other
treatment.<p>

Contrary to the United States' assertion, consideration of these factors demonstrates thatthe EU's
ban is based on an assessment of risk and is supported by scientific evidence that the use of
growth hormones in meat animals constitutes a risk to human health.<p>

			a.	Meat From Animals Treated with Growth Hormones Contains Residues of those Hormones<p>

	As the following evidence demonstrates, the use of each of the growth-promoting hormones
approved by Codex and the FDA results in residues of these hormones in meat from the animals
in which they are used.  These residues are greater than the amounts that naturally occur in such
meat.<p>

	Estradiol-17<p>

	A Joint Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) Expert
Committee on Food Additives found that the use of estradiol-17 as a growth promoter in
livestock increases the natural level of that hormone in edible animal tissues to two to five times
the levels at which it is naturally found.<p>

	A study submitted to the FDA indicated that the administration of Synovex-S, a combination of
estradiol and progesterone that is approved for use in the United States, resulted in estradiol-17
residues that were six to 23 times as great as those naturally occurring in animal tissue. 
Moreover, the use of a second Synovex-S implant, which is also approved by the FDA, nearly
doubled the estradiol-17 residues in fat and muscle of the treated animals.  The use of
Revalor-H, an FDA-approved combination of estradiol and TBA, also results in residues of
estradiol that are greater than those naturally occurring in animal tissue.<p>

	Progesterone<p>

	The FAO/WHO Expert Committee found that there is as much as twice the amount of
progesterone residue in the edible tissues of progesterone-treated animals as in the tissues of
untreated animals.  The same is true when progesterone and estradiol-17 are administered in
combination.<p>

	Testosterone<p>

	The FAO/WHO Expert Committee found that administration of testosterone in combination with
estradiol-17 results in testosterone residues from two to 13 times the normal amounts in the
edible animal tissues.  Studies submitted to FDA indicated that implantation in steers of a
combination of estradiol and testosterone resulted in testosterone residues in edible tissues that
were as much as 30 times higher than normal background levels.<p>

	Trenbolone Acetate (TBA)<p>

	The FAO/WHO Expert Committee found that residues of TBOH, a carcinogenic metabolite of
TBA, occur in the edible tissues of animals treated with TBA.  Studies submitted to the FDA
indicated the same.  TBOH does not occur naturally in animal or human tissues.<p>

	Zeranol<p>

	The FAO/WHO Expert Committee found that treatment with zeranol results in residues in the
edible tissues of the treated animals.  Zeranol does not occur naturally in animal or human
tissues.<p>

	Melengestrol Acetate (MGA)<p>

	Studies submitted to the FDA indicate that edible tissue from animals treated with MGA contain
residues of that hormone.  MGA does not occur naturally in animal or human tissues.<p>

			<a name="cons">b.	Consumption of Growth Hormones Presents a Risk to Human 
Health<p>

	The evidence described in this section demonstrates that growth promoting hormones, including
all of the hormones approved for use by the FDA and Codex, are known to cause cancer in
humans and laboratory animals.  As explained below, this risk is exacerbated by the fact that
these hormones are frequently administered improperly, increasing their concentration in meat. 
Moreover, there is not a practical method of testing meat before it is sold or consumed to ensure
that it does not contain residues of hormonal additives.  There is therefore more than sufficient
risk of harm to human health to justify SPS measures to protect against those risks.<p>

				<a name="hor">(1)	Hormones Approved by the Codex Alimentarius Commission 
and FDA Constitute a Risk to Human Health<p>

	Estradiol-17<p>

	The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that exposure to sex
hormones causes cancer.  The IARC has determined that exposure to estrogenic hormones,
including estradiol-17, causes human cancer.  As the IARC stated:<p>

	The administration of oestrogens (including [DES]) to adult women is causally associated with
an increased incidence of endometrial cancer.  There is also a possibility that the risk of breast
cancer is increased by such therapy.<p>

These effects are increased both with exposure to larger doses of estrogens and with increased
duration of exposure to small doses.  Exposure to estradiol-17 has been found to cause
mammary, pituitary, uterine, cervical, vaginal, testicular, lymphoid, kidney and bone tumors in
experimental animals.<p>

	The FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives also found that high levels of
estradiol-17 "can increase the incidence of tumours in experimental animals."  Estradiol-17
was found to increase the incidence of certain brain tumours in experimental mice.<p>

	Exposure to an excess of estrogen has also been tied to male reproductive disorders.  A recent
report from the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences states:<p>

	The male reproductive system is very sensitive to the influence of an excess of estrogen;
therefore, estrogen-like effects in the environment are a primary suspect for causing the increased
reproductive disorders of men and wildlife animals.<p>

	Progesterone<p>

	The IARC has concluded that progesterone, which studies have shown to increase the incidence
of ovarian, uterine and mammary tumors in mice, may cause cancer in laboratory animals.  The
FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives found that progesterone increased the
incidence of tumors of the mammary gland, ovary, uterus and vagina in laboratory animals.<p>

	The IARC has also stated that there is<p>

	evidence that low doses of progesterone administered over long periods act in combination with
carcinogenic agents, such as some viruses or chemicals, to enhance tumour developments.  In
part, therefore, long-term administration of synthetic progestins may produce a comparable
hazard by increasing the incidence of tumours due to other agents.<p>

	Testosterone<p>

	The IARC has determined that testosterone is "probably carcinogenic to humans."  This is based
in part on the IARC's findings that "testosterone may be involved in the genesis of [prostatic]
tumours" in humans and that there is "sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of testosterone
in mice and rats."<p>

	The FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives found that high doses of testosterone
caused a "surprisingly high" incidence of uterine tumors and an increased level of prostatic
tumors in experimental animals.<p>

	Trenbolone Acetate (TBA)<p>

	The FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives found that long-term feeding of TBA to
rats and mice caused liver hyperplasia and an increase in tumors.  Studies considered by the FDA
indicated that long-term consumption of TBA caused "significant increases in hepatic
proliferative lesions (neoplasia and hyperplasia) in male and female [mice] -- and an increased
incidence of pancreatic islet tumors" in rats.  In addition, when TBA was administered to two
successive generations of mice, it was found to "have an emasculating effect" on male mice and
to cause female mice to develop male characteristics.<p>

	Zeranol<p>

	The IARC has noted that zearalenone, which is produced when zeranol is consumed, has a
carcinogenic effect in experimental animals.  The IARC found that the inclusion of zearalenone
in the diet of such animals caused effects including<p>

	atrophy of the seminal vesicles and testes, squamous metaplasia of the prostate gland,
osteopetrosis, myelofibrosis of the bone marrow, cytoplasmic vacuolization of the adrenal
glands, hyperkeratosis of the vagina and endometrial hyperplasia, . . . pseudopregnancy [and]
infertility.<p>

In addition, consumption of zearalenone by pregnant animals caused a reduction in fetal weight
and an increased prevalence of skeletal problems and incidence of stillbirths.<p>

	The FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives found that zeranol caused brain tumors in
laboratory mice.<p>

	Melengestrol Acetate (MGA)<p>

	Melengestrol Acetate (MGA) is a growth hormone that the FDA has approved for use as a feed
additive in livestock.  Codex has not considered the safety of this hormone.  Documents
submitted to FDA by the manufacturer of MGA indicate that the hormone causes a "significant
increase" in rapidly invasive breast cancers in experimental animals and induces liver and
pituitary tumors in male rodents.<p>

		As these facts make clear, the hormones that have been approved for use by the FDA and Codex
constitute a risk to consumers.<p>

	<a name="eff">Effects of Hormones on Infants and Neonates<p>

	The carcinogenic effects just described are magnified with respect to infants and newborns, who
have been shown to be more susceptible than adults to a wide range of carcinogens.  Substantial
scientific evidence demonstrates that neonatal rodents are more sensitive than adult rodents to the
carcinogenic effects of natural and synthetic hormones, both individually and in combination. 
For example, the IARC noted that "neonatal exposure of mice to progesterone plus estradiol-17
resulted in an increased incidence of mammary tumors."<p>

	<a name="hor">Hormone Combinations<p>

	Growth-promoting hormones are commonly administered to livestock in combination.  For
example, each of the commonly-used, FDA-approved implants Revalor-S, Revalor-H and
Synovex-S contains a combination of two different hormones.<p>

	The IARC has noted that exposure to estrogens combined with either progestins or androgens
(such as testosterone) can cause "[m]asculinization of the external genitalia in female foetuses"
and that combining synthetic progestins with estrogens "seems to enhance [the progestins']
carcinogenic potential."  The IARC has also concluded that oral contraceptives that use a
combination of hormones cause cancer in humans.  As noted above, the IARC has recognized the
carcinogenic effects in mice of neonatal exposure to a combination of progesterone and
oestradiol-17.<p>

				<a name="con">(2)	Non-approved Hormones<p>

	Numerous non-approved hormones are sold on the black markets for use in meat production. 
One such hormone is DES, which, as described above, was once considered safe for use both as a
growth-promoter and by pregnant women.  Another category of non-approved hormones are
2-agonists, with respect to which the EU Scientific conference found that<p>

	[t]here is currently substantial concern about the potential risks to consumer-health at the high
doses [of 2-agonists] necessary for growth promotion, since [2-agonists] are
pharmacologically potent substances.  Since 1990, there have been at least five cases of mass
intoxications after consumption of liver and meat containing high levels of [one of these
substances].  <p>

<p>

		Acute toxic effects observed in animals and man include muscle tremor, tachycardia, palpitations
and nervousness. . . .  The clinical consequences for consumers continuously exposed to residues
of potentially highly active 2-agonists are still unclear.  The use of highly active 2-agonists as
growth promoters is not appropriate because of the potential hazard for human and animal health.<p>

	Other studies have demonstrated the risks associated with 2-agonists.  A report prepared by the
FDA stated that "2-agonists have been associated with the induction of . . . benign tumours in
rats."  Moreover,<p>

	there have been reports of acute poisoning in humans following consumption of liver containing
residues of the beta-agonist, clenbuterol.  The largest confirmed outbreak of this type of
poisoning occurred in Spain between March and July of 1990, and involved 135 people.  Adverse
clinical effects of muscle tremors, tachycardia, palpitations, nervousness, cephalgia and myalgia,
occurred 30 min to 6 h post consumption of beef liver and lasted for about 40 h. . . .  Another
report implicated clenbuterol residues in an acute poisoning episode in France which affected 22
people who consumed beef liver containing 375 - 500 ppb of clenbuterol.<p>

				<a name="con">(3)	The Conclusions of the EU Scientific Conference, Codex 
and the FDA Concerning the Safety of
Growth Hormones Are Based on Mistaken Assumptions<p>

	The agencies that have approved the use of growth-promoting hormones in meat animals have
done so on the basis of several mistaken assumptions.<p>

	Two of these mistakes concern the conclusion that "[t]he daily production of sex hormones by
humans is much higher than the amounts possibly consumed from meat, even in the most
sensitive humans (prepubertal children and menopausal women)" and, therefore, that
consumption of meat with residues of natural sex hormones could not harm humans.  The first
mistake concerning this conclusion is that it does not take into account the effects of such
consumption on the naturally occurring hormone levels in the body.  Scientific evidence indicates
that consumption of meat products containing residues of specific growth hormones increases the
levels of those hormones in the body of the consumer.  Such increases in naturally occurring
hormones disturbs the complex patterns of normal hormonal balance in the body, which in turn
poses carcinogenic hazards.<p>

	The second mistake concerning the relationship between the level of hormone residues in meat
and the amount of hormones in humans is that prepubertal children and menopausal women are
not the segments of the human population that are most sensitive to the incremental effects of the
consumption of hormone-treated meat.  Rather, infants produce the lowest amount of natural
hormones.  As noted above, infants are particularly sensitive to the carcinogenic effects of
hormones.<p>

	A third error made by agencies that have approved the use of growth hormones in meat
production is that they have analyzed the effects of individual hormones in isolation.  As noted
above, growth hormones are frequently administered in combination and such combinations have
been demonstrated to have carcinogenic effects.  Moreover, evidence that xenobiotic pesticides
induce synergistic estrogenic effects that are approximately 1000 times greater than individual
exposure to those pesticides makes it likely that the consumption of combinations of growth
hormones has a similarly extreme effect.  These effects may be further exacerbated by the
interaction of growth hormones with xenoestrogenic pesticides and other industrial chemical
contaminants in meat products, which have been shown to have serious effects on humans,
including increasing reproductive disorders in men.<p>

	Because of the increased risk associated with such possible synergistic effects, the EU Scientific
Conference qualified its conclusion concerning the risk of consumption of hormone residues by
"emphasi[zing] the need for further study of the effects of growth-promoters administered in
combination; the presence of one may disturb the metabolism of others."  The Conference also
noted the need for further research into the "pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions
of combinations of growth promoters and other concomitantly used xenobiotics."  Despite its
recognition of the possible relevance of such considerations, the EU Scientific Conference
nevertheless reached conclusions without obtaining scientific evidence on this point.  Likewise,
neither Codex nor the FDA has considered the possibly serious consequences of exposure to
growth hormone residues in combination with residues of other growth hormones or
contaminants.<p>

	The United States has stated that there is evidence that the use of estradiol-17, progesterone,
testosterone, trenbolone acetate (TBA), zeranol and melengestrol acetate (MGA) present no risk
to humans at the levels found in hormone-treated meat.  However, the existence of scientific
evidence suggesting that there is no risk does not negate the legitimacy of an SPS measure as
long as other scientific evidence indicates that a risk exists.  The United States' own position
concerning conflicting evidence of risk supports this interpretation:<p>

		It is clear that the requirement in the [SPS] Agreement that measures be based on scientific
principles and not be maintained "without sufficient scientific evidence" would not authorize a
dispute settlement panel to substitute its scientific judgment for that of the government
maintaining the [SPS] measure.  For example, by requiring measures to be based on scientific
principles (rather than, for instance, requiring measures to be based on the "best" science) and not
to be maintained without sufficient scientific evidence (rather than, for instance, requiring an
examination of the "weight of the evidence"), the [SPS] Agreement recognizes the fact that
scientific certainty is rare and many scientific determinations require judgments between
differing scientific views.  The [SPS] Agreement preserves the ability of governments to make
such judgments.<p>

Because there is evidence that these hormones may cause serious health problems such as cancer,
the EU is justified in implementing measures to protect against this risk.<p>

			<a name="mis">c.	Misuse of Growth Hormones Presents a Risk to Human 
Health<p>

	Scientists have determined that it is common for there to be high concentrations of hormone
residue in meat "due to the widespread illegal use of multiple ear and, worse still, of muscle
implants."  The EU's Scientific Conference found that<p>

	some producers apparently use injections, rather than implants, of steroid hormones, which is an
impediment to their detection at slaughter and potentially allows the sale of meat containing very
[high] concentrations of hormones.<p>

FDA documents show that in the United States in 1986,<p>

	as many as half of all cattle sampled in feedlots as large as 600 animals were found to have
hormones illegally implanted in muscle rather than the ear skein, to induce further increased
growth.<p>

	These common abuses of growth hormones can result in extremely high hormone concentrations
in meat.  As the IARC has recognized, the risks from consuming growth hormones that are
described above are much greater when the concentration of the hormones is increased.  This
increased risk makes protection against exposure to these hormones even more important. 
Moreover, routine monitoring cannot identify meat that has been affected by intramuscular
injection of growth hormones.<p>

			<a name="ob">d.	Obstacles to Protecting Against Harm from the 
Consumption of Growth Hormones<p>

	Protecting consumers against the risks associated with growth hormones is complicated by the
lack of adequate methods for monitoring the presence of such hormones and the common
practice of mixing the hormones administered to livestock.  <p>

	Identifying the presence of growth hormones in meat is an extremely complicated process that is
impractical in the market context.  There are no available practical methods for detecting natural
or synthetic growth hormones such as those approved for use in the United States.  The excess of
these hormones over normal background levels, whether due to overapplication of the hormones
or intramuscular implantation, can only be identified by using highly specialized tests that are not
suited for routine monitoring of meat samples intended for the market.<p>

	The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives has recognized this, stating that
although<p>

	most methods of analysis for estradiol-17 . . . may be satisfactory for measuring estradiol-17
levels in experimental situations, improvements would be needed if routine analytical methods
for the control of residues were required.<p>

	The FDA has also recognized the absence of practical monitoring methods.  Although FDA
approval of veterinary drugs requires that there be a practical basis for monitoring for the
presence of such drugs, the FDA has waived this requirement with respect to growth hormones
and has relied instead on the complicated, time-consuming laboratory tests undertaken by the
manufacturers of the hormones.<p>

	The absence of practical testing methods may explain the fact that the United States apparently
does not monitor for the presence of growth hormones in meat, despite the FDA's admission that
elevated levels of these hormones could have "adverse effects."  In 1993, the US Department of
Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) monitored meat for residues of animal
drugs and pesticide compounds, but, with the exception of MGA, did not monitor at all for the
presence of residues of growth hormones.<p>

	The common practice of mixing growth hormones used with livestock increases the difficulty of
protecting consumers against the risks associated with these hormones.  As the EU's Scientific
Conference noted, there is<p>

	evidence from many European countries and from elsewhere for the illegal use of
growth-promoting substances, often in the form of mixtures of recognised substances or of others
which are not at present approved for use in any countries.  These practices will not always be
detected by standardised screening techniques.<p>

In light of this evidence, the Conference concluded that<p>

		[i]t might be more difficult to control use of prohibited growth promoting substances in a
situation where certain substances are permitted because veterinary inspection to identify animals
treated with prohibited substances might be more difficult.<p>

	Thus, despite the numerous clearly identified risks associated with the consumption of growth
hormones, as well as the insufficient evidence to analyze many other possible risks, there are no
practical methods for protecting consumers from unwittingly eating meat that has been raised
using such hormones.<p>

	The evidence described above demonstrates that the use of growth hormones in livestock results
in residues of those hormones in meat.  In addition, there is evidence that consumption of such
residues -- whether of those hormones approved for use in the United States or other hormones --
at any level may pose a risk of harm to human health.  This risk is exacerbated by the fact that
common misuse of growth hormones results in elevated hormone concentrations in meat, which
in turn increases the risk of harm to human health.  These risks are sufficient to support the EU's
decision to protect against them completely through measures that achieve zero risk from
hormone residues that differ from those naturally occurring in meat.<p>

		<a name="un">2.	Uncertainties Concerning the Risk from Consuming Growth 
Hormones Support Provisional Health-Protective Measures<p>

	The SPS Agreement allows countries to adopt provisional SPS measures "where relevant
scientific evidence is insufficient."  As the United States has put it, this means that "a country
may choose to err on the side of caution when the science is inconclusive."<p>

	The EU's Scientific Conference identified numerous areas in which the scientific evidence
concerning the risk to human health from the consumption of growth hormones is inconclusive. 
For example, the Conference qualified all of its conclusions with the statement that there is very
little scientific evidence concerning the actual effect of growth hormones on humans:<p>

	[M]ost studies of growth-promoting substances . . . rely on studies with laboratory animals,
where it is common practice to determine a level of administration of the substance concerned
below which no untoward effects can be found; this is called the No Observable Effect Level
(Noel). . . .  [W]hen the Noel is defined by animal experiments alone, directly extrapolating it to
people . . . would take no account of the unknown physiological differences of the responses of
people and the species of the laboratory animals.<p>

Codex has itself noted the uncertainty inherent in assessing risks to human health:<p>

	Human data of insufficient extent may be considered in the setting of [a Codex Acceptable Daily
Intake] on the basis that extrapolation of data from animal studies will contain greater
uncertainty.<p>

	Finally, the IARC has noted that<p>

		Epidemiological studies to evaluate possible carcinogenic effects of administered oestrogens and
progestins in humans suffer from two major difficulties.  Firstly, the interval between the
commencement of administration and the possible appearance of cancer may be long.  Secondly,
to detect a small or moderate change in risk, observations on large numbers of subjects are
required.<p>

	An additional shortcoming of scientific evidence concerning the risk of consuming growth
hormones was expressed by the EU Scientific Conference's Working Group on the Assessment
of Health Risk, which found that "[t]he [acceptable daily intake (ADI)] model has been
developed to establish safe levels of exposure to a single compound, whereas in practice humans
are exposed to mixtures of chemicals.  That circumstance needs further attention."  As noted
above, the Conference qualified its final conclusions with the caveat that there needs to be further
study concerning the effects on humans of combinations of growth hormones.<p>

	Another area of insufficient scientific evidence concerns the effect of consumption of growth
hormones on human DNA.  The EU Scientific Conference stated that its conclusions concerning
the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) amounts for growth promoting hormones did not take into
account the potential for long-term damage to human DNA because<p>

	[t]he ADI concept is not appropriate in the risk-assessment of hazards involving long-term
damage to human DNA (otherwise called "genotoxic" hazards), perhaps leading to cancers of
various kinds.<p>

	. . .<p>

		The ADI model does not predict quantitative risks and is not applicable to genotoxic (damaging
to DNA) carcinogens, for which presumably no threshold levels can be established.  These
substances need a quantitative risk assessment, based on their modes of toxic action.<p>

	When, as here, the scientific evidence concerning risk is inconclusive, the SPS Agreement
permits a country to implement precautionary protective measures as long as the country seeks to
obtain additional information and review the SPS measures within a reasonable time.  The EU
Scientific Conference did this by identifying "a number of priority areas where further research
should be undertaken and where actions should be initiated" with respect to the assessment of the
risk to human life and health from consumption of hormone-treated foods.<p>

	While the EU gathers the information necessary to fill the gaps in the existing scientific evidence
concerning the risk from consumption of hormone-treated meat, paragraph 22 of the SPS
Agreement permits it to implement precautionary measures to protect against this risk.<p>

<p>

	<a name="ban">E.	The EU's Ban on Trade in Hormone-Treated Meat Is Not More 
Trade Restrictive than Required
to Achieve the EU's Zero Risk Level of Protection<p>

	By claiming that the EU must accept meat raised using the growth hormones approved for use in
the United States, the United States is in essence arguing that the means that the EU has chosen
to achieve its chosen level of protection are broader than necessary to do so.  As the preceding
discussion demonstrates, the United States has no other ground for challenging the EU ban than
to argue that the ban is more restrictive than necessary to achieve the EU's zero-risk level of
protection.  The ban is not discriminatory.  It is intended to protect against a risk that is supported
by scientific evidence.  The United States cannot ask the WTO panel to substitute its judgment
for the EU's concerning the weight of the evidence of risk or the appropriate level of protection
against that risk.  Therefore, the United States is arguing that the EU can achieve its zero risk
level of protection while at the same time permitting the importation of animals and meat treated
with hormones approved for use by the United States.<p>

	The SPS agreement explains that a measure is not more trade restrictive than required <p>

		unless there is another measure, reasonably taking into account technical and economic
feasibility, that achieves the appropriate level of protection and is significantly less restrictive to
trade.<p>

During the negotiation of the SPS Agreement, the Director-General of the GATT indicated that
the WTO members <p>

	felt it was obvious from other provisions of the Agreement that the Agreement does not concern
itself with insignificant trade effects nor could a measure be considered more trade restrictive
than necessary in the absence of a reasonably available alternative.<p>

	GATT dispute panels that have interpreting the necessity requirement of Article XX have
reached the same conclusion.  In the Thai cigarette case, the panel concluded that a measures is<p>

	"necessary" in terms of Article XX(b) only if there [are] no alternative measures consistent with
the General Agreement, or less inconsistent with it, which [the country] could reasonably be
expected to employ to achieve its health policy objectives.<p>

Another panel interpreted the same requirement in the context of another GATT exception
(Article XX(d) for measures "necessary" to secure compliance with other laws) not to require a
country to change its substantive law or its desired level of enforcement of that law.  Rather,
where a country can reasonably secure that level of enforcement through other means consistent
with GATT, it must do so.<p>

	The SPS Agreement places the burden on the United States to demonstrate that another measure
is reasonably available, taking into account technical and economic factors, that achieves the
EU's zero-risk level of protection and is significantly less restrictive to trade.  By stating that "a
measure is not more trade restrictive than required unless there is another measure" that achieves
the chosen level of protection and is less restrictive, the Agreement creates a presumption that the
measure in question is the least trade restrictive measure that will achieve the chosen level of
protection.  This presumption can be rebutted by showing the existence of "another measure" that
is less trade restrictive.  The burden is thus on the challenging country to show the existence of
such a measure.  To require the country that has implemented the measure to prove that there are
no less restrictive measures would be to require it to prove an unlimited number of negatives -- it
would have to show that it had considered every possible alternative and that none of them could
achieve the chosen level of protection.<p>

	The United States has proposed no alternative measure that would achieve the EU's level of
protection.  Rather, the United States has argued that the EU ban is more restrictive than
necessary because it "is not intended to achieve any particular level of sanitary protection from
any identified risk."  As set forth above, however, the EU's ban is intended to achieve a zero risk
level of protection from the risk of possible harm to human health resulting from hormone
residues in meat.<p>

	There are no reasonably available alternative measures that would achieve the EU's zero risk
level of protection.  Permitting trade in meat treated with the hormones approved for use in the
United States would not achieve that protection because of the scientific evidence, described
above, that those hormones may harm human health.  <p>

	In addition, the EU Scientific Conference and others have noted that the common misuse of
hormones increases the risks associated with consuming hormone-treated meat and makes it
more difficult to prevent the use of other hormones, such as 2-agonists.  Because there is no
reasonably available means of monitoring for the presence of hormones in meat, banning the use
of all growth hormones and trade in meat treated with such hormones is the only reasonable
means of protecting against the misuse of growth hormones.  <p>

	Therefore, because there are no alternative measures that would effectively achieve the EU's zero
risk level of protection against the risks associated with consumption of hormone-treated meat,
the EU ban is a legitimate sanitary measure that is permitted under GATT and customary
international law.<p>

                          <a name="concl"> CONCLUSION<p>

	Customary international law and GATT both strongly protect each country's right and
responsibility to make the political judgments necessary to determine the appropriate level of
protection against a given risk.  The precautionary principle allows a country to determine that it
will protect against possible risks to human health even if no conclusive or overwhelming
evidence is available as to whether the activity actually causes that harm.  GATT permits
measures legitimately intended to achieve the chosen level of protection as long as they do not
discriminate against foreign products and are not more restrictive of trade than necessary.  The
SPS agreement sets forth standards for determining whether health-protective measures are
legitimate and may be implemented despite any incidental effect on international trade.<p>

	The EU's ban on trade in hormone-treated meat is not discriminatory because it applies equally to
domestic and foreign meat products.  The EU has legitimately chosen zero risk as its appropriate
level of protection against the risks associated with the consumption of hormone-treated meat. 
This choice is supported by a substantial body of scientific evidence indicating that the use of
growth hormones in meat animals results in hormone residues in meat and that consumption of
such residues may cause cancer in humans.  <p>

	Because international law respects a scientifically-supported choice of an appropriate level of
protection, the only challenge available to the United States is that the EU's ban is more
restrictive than necessary to achieve the EU's chosen zero-risk level of protection.  The United
States has failed to suggest any less-restrictive measure that would achieve this level of
protection.  <p>

	For these reasons, the EU ban satisfies the requirements of the SPS Agreement.  Any other
conclusion would be inconsistent with the customary international legal norm of the
precautionary principle and would impermissibly restrict the EU's right to protect consumers
from the risks associated with the consumption of hormone-treated meat.  The WTO panel must
therefore uphold the ban.<p>

GATTzilla attacks NGO eco-labels!<p>

<u><i>Contact:Charlene Barshefsky!</i></b></u> 202-395-3204<p>
Friday, September 27, 1996

                                                                         
                            <p>

This just in:<p>

<p>

At the third meeting of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Forests (IPF
III), which ends in Geneva today, USTR
delegates have inserted the following
bracketed text in the negotiating text on
Trade and Environment Relating to Forest
Products and Services.<p>

<p>

"The Panel ... agreed on the need to ensure that existing
and new certification and labeling schemes for forests
and forest products comply with the provisions of the WTO
Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade."<p>

<p>

While this language is vague, it is
problematic for a number of specific
reasons, and appears to be part of a joint
Canadian-US push to get all timber
labeling schemes, including those
established by NGOs like <b>Smartwood
</b>and the <b>Forest Stewardship Council</b>,
brought under the trade-oriented
disciplines of the TBT. <p>

<p>

In campaign-speak, the USTR is
unleashing Gattzilla on NGO eco-labels.<p>

<p>

The following are the main problems and
uncertainties stemming from this US
proposal:<p>

<p>

	<u>The application of the TBT to private vs.
government schemes</u>. Private schemes
are only subject to the TBT indirectly, in
that some WTO members may be
required --- under Article 4 --- to take
reasonable measures as may be
available to ensure that private
standardizing bodies comply with the
Code of Good Practice (Annex 3 of the
TBT Agreement).<p>

<p>

	<u>The application of the TBT to voluntary
vs. mandatory schemes</u>. Voluntary
schemes, if covered at all, are subject
only to the Code's substantive disciplines.
The TBT Agreement, as well as all WTO
agreements, is a policy agreement
between governments.  It must be
understood as manifesting the policies
upon which the countries intended to
agree. In this context, it is unlikely that
governments intended to subject
voluntary, private ecolabelling schemes to
trade disciplines as contained in the Code
of Good Practice.<p>

<p>

By regulating the market activities of
private actors, the Code goes far beyond
the appropriate scope for
intergovernmental action and breaks from
the mandate traditionally granted to WTO
of reducing government interference with
markets. This is especially true if the
"reasonable measures" standard
contained in Article 4 is interpreted
restrictively.<p>

<p>

	If the Code is interpreted to be void of
environmental exceptions (in that its text
does not include the exceptions as
compared with TBT Article 2 that applies
to technical regulations and WTO Article
XX), then  the result would be that the
TBT Agreement would demand higher
standards of voluntary schemes (that are
covered by the Code).<p>

<p>

<b>While this Canada-US effort is still in its early stages, and the IPF text will not
be finalized until the next meeting of the IPF in February,  it would be very
useful to have US groups starting to ask pointed questions at the USTR in
Washington.  They need to know that we are on their case IMMEDIATELY.<p>

<h3></b>TO: Trade Allies<p>					
FR: Lori Wallach, Global Trade Watch<p></h3>



<h1><center>"Happy" Friday the 13th -- the Day Bill "NAFTA-czar" Daley Was 
Announced Likely Commerce Secretary.</h1></center> <p>

  

The news coming out of the Singapore WTO Ministerial Meeting is bad news. Current media
accounts are mentioning how the U.S. rammed through its priority technology trade plan, but
also ultimately capitulated on labor standards. Despite yeoman's efforts by our labor allies, the
bottom line on labor rights for the WTO Singapore declaration is:<p>

<p>

  	<b>NO LABOR WORKING GROUP:</b> The U.S. did not even get its initial 
request<p>

for a working group on the relationship between labor standards and trade on the table. (Which in
a perverse way may not be entirely bad given that the parallel WTO working group on
environment has turned into an operation for identifying and eliminating green policies that
inhibit trade and considerable work has been required to halt its most egregious proposals.)<p>

<p>

  	<b>NO "HOLD HARMLESS" PROVISIONS FOR ILO:</B> ICFTU (the international<p>

confederation of national trade union federations such as AFL-CIO) certainly got nowhere with
its "social clause" proposal for core International Labor Organization standards to trump
conflicting WTO terms.<p>

<p>

  	<b>NOT EVEN A WTO STUDY ON LABOR ISSUES:</b> The recent U.S. endgame<p>

"compromise" of requesting a WTO study on labor standards and trade was also rejected. <p>

<p>

  	<b>BAD NEW LANGUAGE ON LABOR:</b> While the U.S. advocated that labor 
standards<p>

be considered at WTO, industry and major developing countries have strongly pushed for labor
issues to be only at the ILO (with weak enforcement capacity, unlike WTO.) The Singapore
statement supports this ILO-is-the-place position, among other unfortunate things. <p>

<p>

The Journal article, which many of you saw, says the Administration's WTO labor rights push
was a "ploy" to get labor support for fast track to expand NAFTA and the WTO, given the uphill
fight fast track, NAFTA expansion and other trade plans could otherwise face. If there was any
truth to this article in the first place, the ugly outcome at Singapore -- particularly the
juxtaposition of the labor rights disaster versus the technology pact being pushed through -- has
one bright side: <p>

<p>

Even if the Administration wanted to pursue this strategy and it could have found labor leaders
so inclined, after this Singapore labor rights debacle, the Administration is revealed not to have
pushed all so hard or like the technology deal, it would have happened. Thus, even if anyone in
labor was inclined to cut some such deal, there is not one iota of cover to do so.<p>

<p>

FYI: The Teamsters issued a statement making clear their fast track opposition is (and will
remain) solid.<p>

<p>

                                 A BILL<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

 To assess the impact of the NAFTA, to require further negotiation of<p>

certain provisions of the NAFTA, and to provide for the withdrawal from<p>

              the NAFTA unless certain conditions are met.<p>

<p>

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the<p>

United States of America in Congress assembled,<p>

<p>

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.<p>

<p>

    This Act may be cited as the ``NAFTA Accountability Act''.<p>

<p>

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.<p>

<p>

    The Congress makes the following findings:<p>

            (1) Expanded markets.--One of the purposes of the NAFTA, as<p>

        stated in the preamble, is to ``create an expanded and secure<p>

        market'' for goods and services. Instead, the NAFTA has<p>

        resulted in a spiraling trade deficit with Mexico and Canada<p>

        that will exceed $30,000,000,000 in 1995. Rather than<p>

        harmonious development and expansion as envisioned, the NAFTA<p>

        has resulted in trade deficits which are draining<p>

        $2,500,000,000 a month from the United States economy.<p>

            (2) Currency stability.--One of the purposes of the NAFTA<p>

        is to ``ensure a predictable commercial framework for business<p>

        planning and investment''. However, the NAFTA contains no<p>

        safeguards to minimize the negative economic impacts of severe<p>

        shifts in currency exchange rates among the NAFTA Parties. To<p>

        protect its own economy the United States has sought to bolster<p>

        the Mexican peso which is now being supported by<p>

        $30,000,000,000 in loans, mostly from unwilling United States<p>

        taxpayers. The devaluation of the Mexican peso has more than<p>

        offset tariff reductions and other trade benefits the United<p>

        States expected to achieve from the agreement.<p>

            (3) Fair agricultural trade.--One of the purposes of the<p>

        NAFTA is to reduce distortions to trade. In addition, the NAFTA<p>

        is supposed to promote conditions of fair competition and to<p>

        establish mutually advantageous rules governing trade. However,<p>

        since the NAFTA, there has been a rapid escalation of one-way<p>

        trade of Canadian grain exports of wheat, durum wheat, and<p>

        barley to the United States, disrupting markets and marketing<p>

        channels. Surges in the importation of certain Mexican fruits<p>

        and vegetables threaten domestic production and the importation<p>

        of livestock and meat products from the NAFTA Parties has<p>

        exacerbated the severe problems facing United States livestock<p>

        producers.<p>

            (4) Jobs, wages, and living standards.--One of the purposes<p>

        of the NAFTA is to ``create new employment opportunities and<p>

        improve working conditions and living standards'' in the<p>

        respective territories of the NAFTA Parties. Instead, there has<p>

        been a substantial loss of over 300,000 high-paying jobs in the<p>

        United States. A survey of United States companies conducted 20<p>

        months after the implementation of the NAFTA found that 90<p>

        percent of the companies that had anticipated an increased<p>

        number of jobs from the NAFTA have, in fact, not increased<p>

        employment since the NAFTA was implemented. In the first year<p>

        of the NAFTA's implementation, United States workers had the<p>

        sharpest drop of real hourly wages on record. More than<p>

        2,000,000 workers have become unemployed in Mexico since the<p>

        implementation of the NAFTA and real wages of Mexican workers<p>

        have been slashed 50 percent. In addition to the loss of<p>

        purchasing power, there has been an erosion in the standards of<p>

        living in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.<p>

            (5) Manufacturing base.--One of the purposes of the NAFTA<p>

        is to enhance the competitiveness of firms in the global<p>

        market. However, rather than increase the ability of the<p>

        manufacturing sector in the United States to compete in the<p>

        world market, the NAFTA has facilitated the movement of United<p>

        States manufacturing facilities and jobs to Mexico. The NAFTA<p>

        has contributed to a net loss of 227,000 manufacturing jobs in<p>

        the United States during the last 7 months and an unprecedented<p>

        flood of imports of manufactured goods into the United States.<p>

            (6) Health and environment.--Other purposes of the NAFTA<p>

        are ``to safeguard the public welfare'' and ``to strengthen the<p>

        development and enforcement of environmental laws and<p>

        regulations''. Yet, since the implementation of the NAFTA, the<p>

        public welfare has been undermined by increased imports of food<p>

        products that do not meet United States health standards. In<p>

        addition, the NAFTA has accelerated the relocation of United<p>

        States manufacturing facilities to the United States-Mexico<p>

        border zone, where hundreds of new manufacturing plants have<p>

        been added. Without adequate environmental safeguards, the<p>

        uncontrolled industrial and population growth in the border<p>

        zone has aggravated pollution and health hazards, increasing<p>

        the incidence of infectious diseases and human exposure to<p>

        toxins.<p>

            (7) Illegal drugs.--Rather than safeguarding the public<p>

        welfare, the NAFTA has allowed the increased flow of illegal<p>

        drugs and controlled substances into the United States from<p>

        Mexico. More than half of all cocaine and marijuana illegally<p>

        entering the United States now comes through Mexico, with an<p>

        increasing portion carried by trucks which undergo more limited<p>

        inspection under the NAFTA.<p>

            (8) Protect rights.--The promotion of sustainable<p>

        development as well as the protection and enhancement of basic<p>

        rights are stated objectives of the NAFTA. As envisioned, the<p>

        NAFTA is to increase economic opportunity together with<p>

        expansion of political freedoms and human rights. Yet these<p>

        objectives are not being fulfilled, especially in Mexico, where<p>

        some citizens continue to experience infringements of such<p>

        rights and freedoms.<p>

            (9) NAFTA should not be expanded.--The Congress approved<p>

        the NAFTA in order to achieve economic, social, and<p>

        environmental benefits for the people of the United States.<p>

        Based on currently available information, the goals and<p>

        objectives of the NAFTA are not being achieved. Therefore, the<p>

        NAFTA should not be expanded to include any other country.<p>

            (10) NAFTA to be renegotiated and benefits certified.--<p>

        Based on the experience with the NAFTA since its<p>

        implementation, it has become evident that further negotiation<p>

        is required to resolve fundamental inadequacies within the<p>

        NAFTA with respect to trade balances, currency differentials,<p>

        and agricultural provisions. If the NAFTA is to continue,<p>

        responsible public officials must be able to certify specific<p>

        measures of economic, social, and environmental progress.<p>

        Otherwise Congress has no choice but to withdraw its approval<p>

        of the NAFTA.<p>

<p>

    (b) Areas of Renegotiation and Certification.--The areas of<p>

renegotiation and certification described in this subsection are as<p>

follows:<p>

            (1) Renegotiate the nafta to correct trade deficits.--The<p>

        President is authorized and directed to confer with the<p>

        Governments of Canada and Mexico and to renegotiate the terms<p>

        of the NAFTA to provide for implementation of emergency<p>

        adjustments of tariffs, quotas, and other measures to stabilize<p>

        the flow of trade among the NAFTA Parties when the United<p>

        States has an annual deficit in trade of goods and services<p>

        with another NAFTA Party that exceeds 10 percent of United<p>

        States exports to that Party.<p>

            (2) Renegotiate the nafta to correct currency<p>

        distortions.--The President is authorized and directed to<p>

        confer with the Governments of Canada and Mexico and to<p>

        renegotiate the terms of the NAFTA to provide for the<p>

        implementation of emergency adjustments of tariffs, quotas, and<p>

        other measures to mitigate the adverse effects of rapid or<p>

        substantial changes in exchange rates between the United States<p>

        dollar and the currency of another NAFTA Party.<p>

            (3) Renegotiate the nafta to correct agricultural<p>

        provisions.--The President is authorized and directed to confer<p>

        with the Governments of Canada and Mexico and to renegotiate<p>

        the terms of the NAFTA to provide for the implementation of<p>

        emergency tariffs, quotas, and other measures to bring the<p>

        levels of wheat, durum wheat, and barley imported from Canada<p>

        to levels that are comparable to the levels of these products<p>

        imported during the 10-year period before the date the NAFTA<p>

        entered into force with respect to the United States. The<p>

        President is further authorized and directed to renegotiate the<p>

        NAFTA to establish and strengthen provisions to prevent imports<p>

        of agricultural commodities from any NAFTA Party from unfairly<p>

        displacing United States production and to provide improved<p>

        mechanisms for relief for United States producers that are<p>

        adversely impacted by such imports.<p>

            (4) Certification of gains in united states jobs and living<p>

        standards.--If the Secretary of Labor, after consultation with<p>

        appropriate government agencies and citizen organizations,<p>

        determines that--<p>

                    (A) the number of jobs resulting from increased<p>

                exports of United States manufactured goods to other<p>

                NAFTA Parties exceeds the number of jobs lost because<p>

                of imports of manufactured goods from other NAFTA<p>

                Parties since January 1, 1994, and<p>

                    (B) the purchasing power of wage-earners in the<p>

                United States has increased since January 1, 1994,<p>

        the Secretary shall so certify to the Congress.<p>

            (5) Certification of increased domestic manufacturing.--If<p>

        the Secretary of Commerce, after consultation with the<p>

        appropriate government agencies and citizen organizations,<p>

        determines that the export of United States manufactured goods<p>

        to the NAFTA Parties exceeds the imports of manufactured goods<p>

        from NAFTA Parties, the Secretary shall so certify to the<p>

        Congress. In making the determination, the Secretary shall not<p>

        include any goods originating outside the United States that<p>

        are exported to another NAFTA Party, nor imports from another<p>

        NAFTA Party that are destined for other countries.<p>

            (6) Certification relating to health and environmental<p>

        standards.--<p>

                and the Administrator of the Food and Drug<p>

                Administration, after consultation with appropriate<p>

                government agencies and citizen organizations,<p>

                determine, with respect to imports from NAFTA Parties,<p>

                that since January 1, 1994, there has been a reduced<p>

                incidence of contaminated and adulterated food, food<p>

                containing additives or pesticide residues exceeding<p>

                United States standards, or food containing additives<p>

                or pesticide residues which cannot be legally used in<p>

                the United States, the Secretary and Administrator<p>

                shall so certify to the Congress. In making this<p>

                determination, all foods and food products, including<p>

                fruits, vegetables, grains, oilseeds, and meats, both<p>

                fresh and processed, shall be reviewed. Special<p>

                attention shall be given to foods which have had a<p>

                history of violations.<p>

                investigations on pollution and health hazards in and<p>

                around the United States-Mexico border zone since the<p>

                implementation of the NAFTA. The report shall include--<p>

                        commonly related to industrial pollution,<p>

                        inadequate infrastructures, and hazardous<p>

                        which have occurred.<p>

            (7) Certification relating to illegal drugs.--If the<p>

        review by the Drug Enforcement Administration and consultation<p>

        in an increase in illegal drugs or other controlled substances<p>

        from Mexico or Canada, the Attorney General shall so certify to<p>

        the Congress. The Attorney General through the Drug Enforcement<p>

        Administration shall conduct a thorough review and report to<p>

        the Congress regarding the flow of illegal drugs from Mexico<p>

        and Canada and the relationship of such flow to trade of other<p>

        commodities and services with the NAFTA Parties.<p>

            (8) Certification relating to democracy and human<p>

        freedoms.--If the President, after consultation with<p>

        appropriate government agencies, international organizations,<p>

        and citizen organizations, determines that the Government of<p>

        Mexico--<p>

                    (A) is elected in free and fair elections,<p>

                    (D) protects the rights of its citizens to assemble<p>

                and to organize associations to advance human rights<p>

Accountability Act Fact Sheet</title>

<h1><center>"NAFTA Accountability Act"</h1>
</center>
<center>S-1417; H-2651</center>
<p>

<center><b>Fix It or Nix It </b>-- A Performance Standard for <p>

the North American Free Trade Agreement<p>

</center>
<p>

On the 2nd anniversary of NAFTA's narrow passage, November 17, 1995,  Rep. Marcy
Kaptur (D-OH),  Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR), Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) and Sen. Byron
Dorgan (D-ND) organized 29 bipartisan House Members and 4 Senators to introduce the
<a href="http://www.citizen.org/pctrade/nafta-act.html">NAFTA Accountability Act</a>. <u><p>

</u><p>

The NAFTA Accountability Act applies a basic "do no further harm" test to NAFTA.  The
bill requires objective measures of NAFTA's real performance in each category for which
NAFTA boosters promised benefits:  <b>jobs, wages, illegal drug flows, environmental and
health quality and human and labor rights. </b> Current data in these areas would be compared
with the same data before NAFTA took effect. <p>

<p>

If conditions now are at least equal to conditions before NAFTA, the legislation would have
no effect beyond generating the documantation of such a "break even". If conditions were
found to have become worse, the NAFTA Accountability Act would require NAFTA
renegotiation in those areas.<p>

<p>

If, after renegotiations, NAFTA still failed this "do no further harm" test, then the legislation
provides for the sunset-- the  termination of NAFTA's implementing bill.<p>

<p>

With the 11/15/95 Times-Mirror national poll showing growing public recognition of the
damage bad trade deals do to our wages and jobs, the NAFTA Accountability Act is a great
hook for educating on NAFTA's actual outcomes. The Times-Mirror poll found 55% of
Americans believe NAFTA is a job loser. A December 1995 poll in Mexico found that 66% of
the public believes NAFTA has not been positive for Mexico. <p>

<p>

The NAFTA Accountability Act provides a way to reverse the situation by terminating
congressional authorization if NAFTA fails a "do no harm" test and can not be fixed. <p>

 <p>

Asking Representatives &amp; Senators to cosponsor the Act also provides a hook to show them
how NAFTA has failed and to hold NAFTA supporters accountable. Cosponsoring is a way
for NAFTA-supporters to show a change of heart. The Act is a clever idea -- Members of
Congress who support it are merely voting to examine and document NAFTA's real life
outcomes. If NAFTA fails on its own terms, congressional legislative authorization for
NAFTA terminates. Like other legislation that is authorized for a certain period of time and
then "sunset" or expires, NAFTA would have to be reauthorized. Failure to reauthorize
would trigger NAFTA's 6 month exit clause.<p>

<hr>
<p>
Public Citizen is establishing a Fellowship in the name of Abraham
Fuchsberg -- a nationally-renowned trial attorney -- to provide
young lawyers with an opportunity to work on actual precedent-
setting public interest cases under the close supervision of
highly-experienced Public Citizen Litigation Group staff
attorneys.<p>
 
The Fellowship's goal is to imprint the value of public interest
law on young attorneys at the threshold of their careers, and to
demonstrate that lawyers can be a successful and powerful force in
protecting Americans' rights, health and safety.  Abraham Fuchsberg
is the embodiment of that tradition, and it is only fitting that
this Fellowship bears his name.<p>

The need for this Fellowship is great.  First, public interest law
firms need an infusion of new talent to enable them to respond
effectively to the emerging threats to our system of justice.  More
and more, corporations are relying on highly technical preemption
claims in an effort to cut off all remedies for injured victims. 
And the use of collusive class action settlements to resolve
cheaply and expediently the liability of companies that have
manufactured dangerous products or engaged in deceptive or
fraudulent sales practices is growing at an alarming rate.<p>

More than any other public interest law firm in the nation, Public
Citizen Litigation Group is at the vortex of these battles,
fighting to protect the rights of victims.  Last year alone, our
lawyers argued three preemption cases in the United States Supreme
Court.  And this Term, we are lead counsel in two important cases
before the Court, and co-counsel in two other cases, including the
massive Georgine asbestos class action case, in which we have been
co-lead counsel for the objectors. <p>

Establishing the Fuchsberg Fellowship is also imperative because of
the simple economics of law practice for young attorneys.  Law
students are especially hard-hit by the skyrocketing costs of
education.  All too often, the lure of the high salaries offered by
corporate law firms is overwhelming for talented but debt-laden
young lawyers.  <p>

The Fuchsberg Fellowship can offer young lawyers a way out of the
vicious cycle of debt-forced service at corporate law firms.  By
offering a modest but reasonable starting salary and an entree into
the practice of public interest law, the Fuchsberg Fellowship will
give young law school graduates a meaningful alternative that 
allows them to support themselves while also satisfying their
principles.<p>

We anticipate that the Fellow will work on a wide variety of cases,
but with a special emphasis in two areas -- preemption and class
action litigation.  Although our docket fluctuates, for the past
several years there has been a steep rise in the number of both
preemption and class action cases, and we expect that trend to 
continue.  In view of the high volume of these cases, and the
absence of other public interest involvement in them, this will be
a major focus of our work.  We would expect that the Fellow would
work on both trial and appellate court matters, and we would make
every effort to ensure that the Fellow has the opportunity to argue
in court, as well as write briefs and participate fully in the
litigation process.  <p>

The Fellow will work side-by-side with Public Citizen Litigation
Group staff attorneys, who rank as perhaps the most experienced
group of public interest advocates in the nation.  In the
aggregate, they have practiced law for over fifteen years, and have
been at Public Citizen over a decade.  One lawyer, the Public
Citizen Litigation Group's co-founder and first director, Alan B.
Morrison, has been with the organization for twenty-five years. 
Three other lawyers, including David C. Vladeck, the Group's
current director, have been with Public Citizen more than fifteen
years, and each has practiced law for twenty years or more.  The
remainder of the lawyers average nearly ten years in practice.  Not
only are they experienced, they are also teachers.  Staff lawyers
serve as Adjunct Professors of law at Harvard, NYU, Georgetown and
American Universities.  Thus, there can be no question that the
Fuchsberg Fellow will be given the highest quality supervision.
 
The Abraham Fuchsberg Fellowship will be continuously occupied,
except for the time needed to select appropriate candidates.  The
Fellows will rotate every twelve months, and will be recruited
through the law schools, individual faculty members, public
interest consortiums (like the National Association of Public
Interest Law and the Equal Justice Foundation), and a large network
of law clerks.  Candidates will be selected by the President of
Public Citizen and the Director of the Public Citizen Litigation
Group from among the applicants. We plan to have the first Abraham
Fuchsberg Fellow join Public Citizen in September, 1997.<p>

<title>Supreme Court Assistance Project</title>

<h1><center><FONT SIZE=+4>S</FONT>UPREME <FONT SIZE=+4>C</FONT>OURT 
<FONT SIZE=+4>A</FONT>SSISTANCE <FONT SIZE=+4>P</FONT>PROJECT</h1> </center>
	1995 marked another successful year for the Supreme Court Assistance Project in identifying cases with the
potential of a broad public impact.  Many lawyers arguing cases before the Supreme Court have no background
in practicing before the Court, and the experience can be different from arguing before other courts, even for very
seasoned lawyers.  Our expertise and knowledge have become a valuable resource to litigants, and helps to ensure
that the Court is presented with the strongest possible arguments.  We help attorneys who have been successful
in lower courts to preserve their victories by assisting them in drafting briefs arguing that the Court should not
grant review.  And where review is granted, we assist lawyers in drafting their briefs and in preparing for oral
argument.<p>

<p>

	During the 1994 Term, SCAP was involved in approximately 30 of the 80 cases heard by the Court. During
the 1995-96 Term, the Project has offered assistance 17 times in the pre-<i>certiorari</i> stage-- that is, before the
Court grants review.  Public Citizen lawyers have participated in 9 cases that have already been argued, and we
are assisting in another 10 cases that will be argued before the Term ends.<p>

<p>

	Here are a few significant cases we worked on during 1995 that have been decided by the Court.<p>

<p>

<i><b>	Heintz v. Jenkins</i>.</b> We assisted the counsel for the consumer in a Supreme Court case presenting the issue
of whether attorneys are exempt from the requirements of the Federal Debt Collection Practices Act.  In a
unanimous ruling, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the consumer, and held that there was no exemption for
attorneys, nor any doctrine that would permit attorneys involved in collecting debts through litigation to ignore
the requirements of the Act. <p>

<i><b><p>

	Johnson v. Jones</i></b>.  We assisted counsel for the plaintiff in a civil rights case that presented an important
issue concerning the ability of government officials to appeal before a final judgment, a practice that can frustrate
or, at a minimum, delay recovery by victims of civil rights abuses.  In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court
rejected arguments by the federal government and state officials that officials charged with civil rights violations
should be permitted to take an immediate appeal from any ruling by a trial judge rejecting an official's claim that
he or she is entitled to judgment, even if the official's claim is based on factual issues, rather than purely legal
issues.<p>

<i><b><p>

	Wolens v. American Airlines</i>.</b>  Our continuing activity monitoring claims that consumer rights are
"preempted" by federal statute took to the airways in a division that landed in 1995.  We worked with lawyers
who persuaded the Supreme Court to let passengers who belong to American Airlines' frequent flier program sue
the airline for breach of contract.  The suit challenged a 1988 decision by American to raise the number of miles
needed to earn free trips or other benefits, and the Supreme Court agreed the passengers' claim was not
preempted.<p>

<p>

<i><b>	Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno</i></b>.  Even the most unusual cases find their way to the Supreme Court
Assistance Project.  Late one night, a vehicle driven by an off-duty DEA agent in Barranquilla, Colombia, who
was allegedly intoxicated and accompanied by a civilian companion, collided into the car of several Colombian
civilians, causing them serious injuries.  The civilians sued the DEA employee in federal court in Virginia, where
the employee resided, seeking compensation for their injuries.  The DEA agent claimed that he is immune from
liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which exempts any federal employee from suit when acting within
the scope of his or her employment.  The U.S. Attorney from Virginia certified, without giving any reason, that
the DEA Agent employee was acting within the scope of his employment, and the lower courts held that a "scope
of employment" certification, however wrong it may be, is absolutely final and is not subject to correction by the
court.<p>

<p>

	After the Supreme Court decided to review the case, the Litigation Group entered the fray, helping the
Colombian attorney prepare his briefs and oral argument.  In a 5-4 victory, the Supreme Court held that the U.S.
Attorney's certification is <i>not</i> final, and the court has a duty to review "scope of employment" issues, which will
finally allow the car accident victims in this case--and others like them--their day in court. <p>

<b></b><p>

<p>

	Within the legal profession, the Litigation Group is probably best known for our landmark litigation in the field
of separation of powers.  While this may seem an esoteric area with seemingly little connection to the lives of
ordinary Americans, that is not so.  Arrogation of power by any branch of government inevitably harms citizens. 
This year,  we had only one matter in active litigation that involved a separation of powers issue. Two proposals
before Congress, however, raised vital separation of powers issues on which we weighed in.<p>

<p>

<b>	Airports Authority Litigation</b>  After two rounds of litigation, including a major victory in the Supreme
Court, this case may finally have come to a close.  The main issue in this case was whether Congress, in
delegating control over the airports in the Washington, DC region to a local authority, could retain control over
the authority by selecting the members of a board of review that could overrule the authority's decisions.  In the
first phase of the case, the Supreme Court struck down a review board composed of Members of Congress on
the ground that it violated the principle established by the Court in <i>INS v. Chadha</i> (another case we handled) that
Congress may act only through legislation, and cannot override an administrative body in any other way.  <p>

	After our initial victory, Congress amended the law to give it power to select many of the board members and
to require that the authority's key decisions could not take effect until Congress had been given an opportunity
to override them.  In another major victory, the court of appeals held that this scheme also violated the
Constitution on <i>Chadha</i> grounds.  The Airports Authority sought review in the Supreme Court, but its petition
was denied.  Congress needs to amend the law once again, and we are hopeful that Congress will give up its quest
to exercise supervisory power over the authority.<p>

<b><p>

	Line-Item Veto</b>. We have long held the view that bills to give the President line-item veto are
unconstitutional, and we argued strenuously against the adoption of such legislation which passed both Houses
of Congress in 1995.  The House and Senate versions differ substantially, and no conference has yet been held
to iron out those differences.  We have made our views known to key legislators and committee staffs and, if a
bill is signed into law, will likely commence litigation to have the veto provision declared unconstitutional.<p>

<p>

<b>	Balanced Budget Amendment</b>.  In the aftermath of the Republican takeover of Congress, proposals were
introduced in both Houses to add a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.  While proponents of the
amendment followed the procedures set forth in the Constitution, we argued that the provision was unwise
because it would be unmanageable and would produce enormous inter-branch friction because of the inherent
difficulties in accurately forecasting and tracking federal revenues and expenditures.  We were gratified to see
this effort fail, but recognize that this issue is likely to be raised again in 1996.<p>

<b></b><p>

	This area has always been  of considerable activity by Litigation Group lawyers because of our
commitment to open the flow of information relating to the availability and cost of legal services to
consumers to enable them to make better informed hiring decisions.  Litigation Group lawyers
handled the first Supreme Court case recognizing that commercial speech is entitled to First
Amendment protection, and over the years we have litigated a number of the most significant
commercial speech cases involving the regulation of the professions.<p>

<p>

	<b>Schwartz v. Welch</b> This matter is the first case to go to trial on the question whether states may
severely restrict the ability of lawyers to advertise on television and radio. We represented a
consortium of lawyers, media groups, and consumers who argued that lawyer advertising gives
consumers important information about where to find lawyers able to handle their problems at an
affordable price.  We also argued that advertising promotes price competition.  <p>

<p>

	After a week-long trial, the presiding judge ruled in our favor and 
against the state across the
board.  He held that the First Amendment requires a state to have a strong interest in restricting
broadcast advertising and that the state had failed to show that broadcast advertising created any
problems in Mississippi, let alone the sort of problems that justified the sweeping rules Mississippi
had imposed.  Because of the strength of the district court's ruling, the State decided not to appeal.<p>

<p>

<b>	Colorado</b>. Our success in Mississippi led to our being asked to assist a group of Colorado lawyers
trying to fend off a state bar proposal to institute lawyer advertising rules similar to those enacted in
Mississippi.  We have drafted extensive submissions to the Colorado Bar and anticipate having to
appear on this matter before the Colorado Supreme Court in 1996.<p>

<b></b>   Measured by sheer numbers, the Litigation Group has
handled more cases challenging government secrecy than
any other category of case.  We believe that these cases are
vitally important.  They give the public a window on
how their government is operating and  why critical policies were
implemented.  They also enhance government
accountability, since decision-makers know that they will be called
on to defend the policy choices they make.<p>

  <p>

     This year was consistent with our historic practice.  At any
given point, we had at least a dozen pending cases
challenging government secrecy - either the government improperly
withholding records, or courts entering
sealing orders that bar the public from reviewing important court
files.  We discuss a few of the most noteworthy
cases on our docket.<p>

<p>

<b>  Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President</b>. This
precedent-setting case, pending for seven years,
has already established that the electronic records generated by
the White House and the rest of the Executive
Branch are subject to the federal open government laws. In 1995 we
scored a number of additional victories. <p>

<p>

     First, the government released over 3,000 e-mail records used
by the White House and the National Security
Council during the Reagan Administration.  After being recovered
from backup tapes preserved as a result of our
earlier victories, the records were processed under the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA).  We believe that this
is the first time that e-mail records have been recovered from
electronic storage devices to respond to a FOIA
request.  <p>

<p>

     The e-mail records released by the government contained many
new insights concerning the foreign policy
activities and internal politics of the Reagan Administration. 
Although the government claimed that significant
portions of these electronic mail records were exempt from
disclosure under FOIA provisions relating to
classified and national security information, we successfully
demonstrated that many of these exemption claims
were untenable, which resulted in the government releasing
additional portions of the records.  A number of the
remaining exemption claims made by the government were upheld by
the district court, and our challenge to some
of them are on appeal.  One of our clients in this case, the
National Security Archive, used the messages secured
in this litigation to compile a book on the importance of
electronic mail as a record of government decision
making and policy, entitled <i>White House e-mail</i> (November,
1995).<p>

<p>

     Second, on a separate issue in the same litigation, the
National Security Council has asserted that it is not an
agency for purposes of the FOIA or the Federal Records Act, a novel
claim that, if successful, would exempt the
NSC from any obligation to preserve and disclose government records
in accordance with these statutes.  In
February, 1995, the trial court rejected the NSC's contention
ruling, on the basis of an  extensive record that we
had compiled, that the history and activities of the NSC showed
that it functions as an agency of the federal
government by issuing rules, adjudicating disputes, and performing
other agency functions.  The NSC took an
appeal, and we are awaiting a decision.<p>

<p>

     Third, the National Archives adopted new regulations that
explicitly direct all federal agencies to preserve and
maintain electronic records as part of their records management
program.  As a result, agencies throughout the
government are now required to issue directives informing staff of
their obligation to preserve electronic mail
records and to monitor compliance with these directives.  These new
regulations mark a significant victory,
particularly since as recently as 1993 the National Archives and
the White House were adamantly proclaiming
that agencies were free to disregard their electronic mail systems
for purposes of compliance with the Federal
Records Act.<p>

<p>

<b>  American Historical Association v.  Peterson</b>. As a result
of the <i>Armstrong v. Executive Office of the
President</i> litigation, the White House was unable to carry out
plans to destroy Presidential records stored on the
White House electronic mail system at the end of the Bush
Administration.  Instead, the Archivist, Don W.
Wilson, signed an agreement with former President Bush that
purported to give Mr. Bush control over the
disposition of any Presidential materials on backup tapes and hard
drives from the White House computer system. 
At the end of 1994, we filed an action to prevent the National
Archives from implementing the Bush-Wilson
Agreement, which was disturbingly similar to former President
Nixon's effort to retain control over the Watergate
tapes after he resigned.  In February, the trial court ruled that
the Bush-Wilson Agreement violated the
Presidential Records Act and was an unconstitutional effort by the
former President to control public records. 
The Clinton Administration took an appeal from this ruling, but
later abandoned the appeal, marking the death
knell of this effort to retain private control over public records.
<p>

<p>

<b>  Public Citizen v. DOJ and National Archives.</b>  This FOIA
lawsuit is yet another outgrowth of the
<i>Armstrong</i> and Bush/Wilson litigation.  We are seeking
correspondence exchanged between the Department of
Justice and the National Archives and Records Administration, and
George Bush's and Ronald Reagan's lawyers
concerning the disposition of electronic records created by the
Executive Office of the President during the terms
of Presidents Reagan and Bush.  The government will likely claim
that the documents are internal agency
memoranda protected from disclosure under FOIA--an argument we
believe is untenable since the
correspondence was shared with a wide-range of non-governmental
personnel.  <p>

<p>

<b>  Hammock v. Hoffmann LaRoche.</b> For the last four years we
have been trying to unseal health and safety
records submitted in a damages action brought in a New Jersey state
court by a woman who, while pregnant, was
given Accutane, an anti-acne medicine that causes birth defects.<p>

<p>

     We  filed a motion with the court to make the health and
safety data used in the case public.  After the trial
court and intermediate appellate court rejected our efforts, the
New Jersey Supreme Court granted review for the
express purpose of establishing standards for protecting public
access to court records in New Jersey.  In August,
the Court ruled in our favor in an opinion that is a resounding
endorsement of the view that court records are
presumptively subject to public access and should only be placed
under seal in the most extraordinary
circumstances, particularly when the records relate to public
health and safety.  The case was remanded to the trial
court with instructions to review the records concerning Accutane
in accordance with the strict standards set forth
in its opinion.<p>

<p>

<b>  FDA Drug Safety Data</b>. Still pending on our docket are
three FOIA cases seeking access to FDA health and
safety data relating to drugs.  One case seeks records relating to
the "fentanyl lollipop," a narcotic lollipop used
to relax children in preparation for surgical procedures.  We
believe that it is a bad idea to equate narcotics with
candy and are concerned that the active ingredient is too potent
for pediatric use.  Another case seeks access to
data on the experimental drug FIAU, which was being developed to
fight hepatitis, but caused irreversible liver
damage in humans.  We have succeeded in getting a significant
amount of data in this case, but the case is still
under review.  Finally, building on the FIAU case, we have sued the
FDA to get access to records concerning all
experimental drugs whose testing has been halted because of serious
adverse health effects in humans.  Our
concern is that the FDA is too lax in allowing human trials to
begin before the agency has carefully reviewed the
necessary animal studies.<p>

<p>

<b>  Levy v. CIA. </b>Our client is a writer preparing a biography
of Morris "Two-Gun" Cohen--a British subject
and a Canadian citizen who was a confidant of Sun Yat-Sen and
active in Chinese affairs in the 1920s to 1940s. 
When our client asked the CIA for any documents on Cohen, who died
in 1970, the CIA refused even to confirm
or deny the existence or nonexistence of responsive records.<p>

     In the district court, the CIA argued that it had a policy of
refusing to confirm or deny the existence of
documents as to any request pertaining to a foreign national.  The
judge found that the CIA's policy might be
subject to exceptions in some cases, but that this case was not one
of them.  An appeal on behalf of Mr. Levy is
pending.<p>

<p>

<b>  Sims v. Department of State</b>. For   the past five years,
Professor John Sims has been trying to pry loose
a full set of the government's documents relating to the litigation
of the Pentagon Papers case.  To assist him, we
have brought a number of FOIA cases against several government
agencies, including the Departments of State,
Defense, and Justice, and the National Security Agency.  Based
largely on the documents he has obtained through
FOIA, Professor Sims has published an extensive critical account of
the litigation.<p>

<p>

     This year, our litigation against the Department of State on
Prof. Sims' behalf succeeded in gaining access to
yet another series of long-withheld documents, casting further
doubt on the government's claim that the release
of the Pentagon Papers caused harm to our nation's diplomatic
efforts.  Although we have already largely
prevailed, litigation is ongoing with regard to a few remaining
records withheld by the Department.<p>

<p>

     In addition, the Second Circuit granted our motion to unseal
the records filed under seal in the Second Circuit
Stage of the <i>Pentagon Papers</i> Case, revealing for the first
time the transcript of the <i>in camera</i> proceedings before
the Second Circuit and the special appendix filed by the
government.<p>

<p>

<b>  Westinghouse Steam Generators</b>. On behalf of the Union of
Concerned Scientists and Public Citizen's
Critical Mass Energy Project, we have successfully intervened in
litigation pending in federal court in Pittsburgh
to unseal records pertaining to the safety of Westinghouse steam
generators installed in two nuclear electric
generating facilities in Western Pennsylvania.  The premature aging
of Westinghouse steam generators has
resulted in at least fourteen lawsuits by utilities against
Westinghouse.  When our motion to intervene in the
<i>Duquesne Light Co, et al. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp.</i>
case was granted, over 7000 documents were under
seal.  That case went to trial, and the vast majority of the
documents we sought became public.  We first reached
a settlement with the plaintiff utilities that lifted the seal on
additional documents.  Then in 1995, the trial judge
ordered Westinghouse to produce evidence to demonstrate that it
would suffer competitive harm from lifting the
seal on the remaining documents.  As a result, we were able to
reach a settlement with Westinghouse in January
1996.  A number of key documents, including summary judgment
materials, the parties' pre-trial statements, and
more than 400 exhibits that the utilities had produced supporting
their allegations against Westinghouse have
now been unsealed.<p>

<b>  Insurance Forum v. Insurance Commission</b>. This matter  is
a New York State freedom of information 
case brought by a newsletter that focuses on insurance issues to
gain access to reports submitted by insurance
companies that detail all improper sales activities and practices
the companies engaged in over the past few years. 
The New York Insurance Department called for these reports after an
investigation showed wholesale violations
of the Department's fair sales practices rules.  The case is fully
briefed and is awaiting decision.<p>

<p>

<b>  Nixon Tapes Case. </b>After President Nixon had resigned from
office, he attempted to take all his papers and
the White House tapes with him, but Congress stepped in and passed
a law requiring the National Archives to
take control of the papers, return the purely private materials to
Mr. Nixon, and make the rest public as soon as
possible, subject to certain exemptions that generally follow the
FOIA.<p>

<p>

     In March 1992, more than 17 years after the law was passed, we
brought suit on behalf of Wisconsin history
professor and Nixon scholar Stanley Kutler, seeking a court order
to force the Archives to comply with the law,
especially for the more than 200 hours of as-yet-unreleased
Watergate tapes. The former president intervened,
and the case became tied up in procedural knots, in part because
the Archives has failed even to return copies of
the private portions of the tapes to Mr. Nixon.   Mr. Nixon died in
April 1994 and his executors were substituted
for him.  Thereafter, the parties agreed to court-supervised
mediation in an effort to resolve the matter. 
Unfortunately, there are significant legal and practical
difficulties, but we are continuing to press this most
important matter.<p>

     We continued our work challenging state laws that prevent
minor political parties from cross-nominating major party
candidates for political office, a strategy known as "fusion." 
forty states
forbid third parties from giving their own party's nomination to a
major party candidate, thus forcing
third parties to sit out a race or to run someone against major
party candidates whom they would
otherwise support.  This restriction limits the opportunities of
third parties, inasmuch as many voters
are afraid of "wasting" their vote on a minor party candidate, even
if they are sympathetic to the third
party's platform.<p>

<p>

     In 1995, we handled cases challenging anti-fusion laws in both
Pennsylvania and Minnesota, and
lost both in the trial courts.  Only five days into 1996, however,
a federal appeals court agreed with
us, striking down the Minnesota law that prohibited a new,
progressive party from cross-nominating
a state legislator who was sympathetic to the new party's agenda. 
The Minnesota ruling now creates
a split in the circuits since a different court of appeals upheld
a Wisconsin anti-fusion law in an earlier
decision, which increases the likelihood that the Supreme Court
will resolve this question.  Our
challenge to a similar restriction in Pennsylvania is pending in
another appeals court.<p>

<h3><center></b><A NAME="CR">CORPORATE
RESPONSIBILITY</a><b></h3>
</center>
<p>

This component of our work has always had two basic strands--serving as a watchdog to make
sure that
the government enforces the laws that are designed to protect the public, and combating the use
of
corporate power that jeopardizes the rights and well-being of the American consumer.  This
year,
however, our corporate accountability work took center stage, <p>

especially with regard to abusive class action settlements and preemption.<p>

<p>

<center><i><A NAME="CA">Class Actions</a></i><p>

</center>
<p>

     1996 marks the 30th anniversary of the federal courts' modern class action rules.  When
put into place in 1966,
the class action rules were lauded as a means of empowering individual plaintiffs with relatively
small claims
by permitting them to band together to litigate their claims in one suit.  Within the last few years,
however,
manufacturers of defective products have seized on the class action device as an expedient and
often cheap
way of disposing of all of the claims against them in a single proceeding.<p>

<p>

     Sometimes these class action settlements obtain reasonable relief for class members.  But
all too frequently,
the relief proposed for class members is paltry, while their lawyers walk away with a mammoth
legal fee.  Our
participation in these cases is vital.  Once lawyers for  the class and the defendant cut a deal, it
can be very
difficult to persuade judges to reject the settlement.  Also, there are few lawyers who are willing
to object to
excessive fees being paid the plaintiffs' counsel as part of the settlement.  For these reasons,
many private
lawyers are unwilling to advocate on behalf of the interest of absent class members.  Without
our involvement,
there would be no effective counterforce to present the interests of class members, as a few
examples make
clear.<p>

<p>

     <b>General Motor Side-Saddle  Trucks<i>.</b>  </i>In this class action, more than 5
million GM truck owners sought
damages and a fix for their pick-up trucks that they alleged were deadly fire hazards because the
"side-saddle"
gas tanks are located outside the frame of the truck.  The settlement provided class members
with a coupon
toward the purchase of a new GM truck or minivan, but <i>no</i> repair for their trucks and no
money for the class
members to seek a repair on their own, although the class lawyers were to be paid about $10
million in fees. 
After a brief hearing, the trial court approved the settlement.<p>

<p>

     On behalf of several truck owners, Public Citizen appealed to a federal appeals court in
Philadelphia, which
struck down the settlement as unfair.  The court's landmark 104-page decision set strict
standards for settling
future consumer class actions and for the award of reasonable attorney's fees.  Critical to the
court's ruling was
its admonition that, in order to secure court approval, class action settlements must confer real
value on the
class members.  GM sought review in the Supreme Court, but we successfully fought that as
well.  We are
now working toward a trial or settlement that  would give the class members an opportunity to
fix their trucks,
at GM's expense, and have negotiated for Public Citizen to be represented on the plaintiffs'
steering committee
to ensure that consumers have a voice at the table if settlement discussions resume.<p>

<p>

<i><b>    </i>Bronco II Utility Vehicles<i>.</i></b>  This class action, filed on behalf of
700,000 Bronco II sports utility vehicle
owners, alleged that the vehicle's boxy design led to hundreds of deadly "roll over" accidents. 
The class
sought a fix of the vehicle and money damages because the resale value of the vehicle had
dropped
substantially.  However, the settlement with Ford provided warning stickers and a "safety" video
(plus a
whopping $4 million for the class' lawyers), but did nothing to fix the Bronco IIs or to pay 
damages to the
owners.  Despite a full-court press by Ford and plaintiffs' counsel, a federal judge in New
Orleans reviewed
evidence from our safety experts and threw out the settlement on the ground that it provided the
class members
with "effectively zero."  The court also found  that the $4 million fee request--which Ford agreed
to
pay--was evidence of possible collusion between Ford and the class lawyers.  Since the court's
decision, we
have been working with a group of lawyers seeking to advance the case to trial and achieve  a
fair resolution
for the owners of the defective Bronco IIs.<p>

<p>

<b>  Chrysler</b> <b>Minivans (Hanlon).</b>  This case involves a defect in nearly four
million Chrysler minivans
manufactured from 1984 to 1995 which causes the rear liftgate latches to pop open in collisions. 
According
to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), at least 35 people have died in
accidents
in which the liftgates opened.  Many of the victims have been young children.  In March 1995, in
response
to a NHTSA investigation, Chrysler announced that it would replace all rear liftgate latches free
of charge. 
Soon thereafter, a nationwide class action settlement was reached providing nothing more for
the class  than
what the class was already entitled to receive under Chrysler's agreement with NHTSA.   On
behalf of the
Center for Auto Safety and several individual minivan owners, we submitted extensive
objections to the
settlement, which focused mainly on the lack of value conferred by the settlement and the
outlandish fee award
of  $5 million to class counsel.<p>

<p>

     A federal judge in San Francisco approved the settlement over objections from us and
other minivan owners. 
We have appealed and expect argument to be heard this year.<p>

<p>

<i><b>    </i>Ford Mustang Convertibles (Dale<i>).</i> </b>This class action case
involved a settlement on behalf of owners of
1983-1986 Ford Mustang convertibles that allegedly were defectively designed, causing a lack of
crashworthiness and wind noise and water leakage into the car.  Although the cost of fixing each
car would
be only $600, the settlement would provide each class member with a $400 non-transferable
coupon, valid
for only 12 months, that could be used only toward the purchase price of any new Ford car or
truck.<b>  </b><p>

     Representing dissatisfied class members, Public Citizen filed objections to the
settlement.  We argued that the
settlement was worthless to the vast majority of class members because most members would
not want to buy 
a new Ford, or would not be able to afford a new car within the limited 12 month period. 
Nonetheless,
without making specific findings regarding the fairness, adequacy, or reasonableness of the
settlement, the
judge approved the settlement and just under $1 million in attorneys' fees.  Following our
suggestion,  the
court did, however insist  that this settlement not preclude claims for death or personal injury
resulting from
the defect.   We have appealed, and we expect argument before the  California Court of Appeals
in the Spring
of 1996. <i><b><p>

<p>

     </i>Asbestos Class Action</b> <b>(Georgine).</b>  Until the early 1970's, use of
asbestos was widespread and many
workers, such as insulators and boiler room operators, were heavily exposed to it.  Tragically,
when inhaled
into the lungs, asbestos causes many serious diseases,  including several deadly cancers.  This
class action
concerns an attempt by 20 asbestos  companies to get out of the tort system forever. <p>

<p>

     The companies convinced several plaintiffs' lawyers to bring, and immediately settle, a
class action case which
would shunt future claims of workers injured by asbestos into a workers' compensation-type of
process run
by the 20 companies, with strict limits on the amount of money recoverable.  The class consists
of as many
as 20 to 30 million people who have been exposed to asbestos on the job, but who have yet to
manifest any
illness or disease as a result of the exposure.<p>

<p>

     On behalf of several asbestos victims, asbestos advocacy groups, and labor unions, the
Litigation Group,
working with asbestos plaintiffs' lawyers who refused to join the class counsel,  challenged this
settlement as
unfair and as an unconstitutional effort to deprive future asbestos victims--who currently may
not even know
that they were exposed to asbestos--of their day in court.  After months of preparation and a
multi-week trial,
the trial judge in Philadelphia approved the settlement.  We appealed the decision, and the court
of appeals
heard argument in November 1995.  We expect a  decision sometime in 1996.  <p>

<p>

<b>  Arsenic (Hayden).</b> The asbestos class action is not the only effort to use the federal
courts to set up a cheap
compensation scheme for people who may have been exposed to a toxic substance but have not
yet manifested
an injury.   In <i>Hayden v. Elf Atochem, N.A.</i>, the owner of a chemical plant in Bryan,
Texas reached a
settlement with class counsel binding all present and future claimants alleging injuries arising
from exposure
to arsenic which the plant spewed out for decades.  The class originally sought relief only for
property
damages and medical monitoring, and the court certified the action as an "opt-out" class,
meaning that any
class member who did not want to be bound to the agreement could decide not to participate. 
During
settlement negotiations, however, class counsel agreed to include present and future injury
claims, and to
eliminate the opt-out rights of class members.  The resulting mandatory settlement created a
trust fund which
must be distributed in full to class members over the next seven years, although the record
reflects that the
latency period to develop disease from arsenic exposure lasts up to 40 years, with most of the
illnesses not
becoming manifest until well after the seven year period expires.<p>

<p>

     We represent class members who lived in Bryan for two years and were exposed to the
arsenic.  They now
live out of state and did not receive notice of the action.  They object to the proposed settlement
because it
would eliminate their rights to receive <i>any</i> compensation for future illnesses that develop
after the expiration
of a seven-year period and because they have not been given the opportunity to opt out of the
settlement. The
federal magistrate-judge handling the case approved the settlement.  We have appealed to the
district judge,
claiming that the magistrate was wrong in approving the settlement.  If the district judge agrees
with the
magistrate, we will take our arguments to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.<p>

<p>

<b>  Heart Valve Class Action<i>.</i></b>We  continue our work on behalf of the victims of
the Bjork-Shiley Convexo-Concave artificial heart valve, which was implanted in over 80,000
patients worldwide during the early 1980's. 
The valve has a tendency to fracture once in the body, resulting in death or serious injury.  After
Public
Citizen's Health Research Group uncovered evidence of the valve's defective design and
manufacturing and
of the manufacturer's efforts to hide the truth about the valve's problems, it petitioned the Food
and Drug
Administration to remove the valve from the market in 1984, which resulted in the valve's
withdrawal from
the market in 1986.<p>

<p>

     In 1990, the Litigation Group challenged a class action settlement in Cincinnati which
we believed sold the
patients short in terms of monetary recovery, payments for valve replacement surgery, and other
benefits. 
Working with other advocates, our objections were noted favorably by the judge, and the
settlement was
substantially overhauled to address many of our concerns.<p>

<p>

     Public Citizen remains involved in the case to work for the fair implementation of the
settlement which will
be ongoing for many years.  We are the only opponents of the class counsel's gargantuan $33
million fee
request, which, if approved, will come directly out of the patients' recoveries.  We filed lengthy
objections to
the exorbitant fee request in the Fall of 1995, and we await the court's decision.<p>

<b><p>

     Breast Implant Settlement</b>.  Our involvement in this matter dates back to the late
1980s, when Litigation
Group lawyers filed a Freedom of Information Act case for Public Citizen's Health Research
Group (HRG)
against the Food and Drug Administration to compel the disclosure of health and safety records
showing the
serious adverse health affects associated with silicone-gel breast implants.  Once these records
were made
public, we represented our HRG colleagues who led the charge to get the FDA to restrict the sale
of silicone-gel implants.<p>

<p>

     A nationwide class action case was filed and tentatively settled in 1994. We became
active participants to
ensure that there will be adequate compensation for all affected women, including those who are
not currently
experiencing serious illness.  We have also raised questions about the amount of attorneys' fees
to be paid and
the method by which fees should be calculated.  The settlement has now unraveled because the
main
defendant, Dow-Corning, filed a bankruptcy petition, which effectively freezes all litigation
pending against
it.  As a result of Dow-Corning's filing, we have had to become active in the bankruptcy
proceeding as well.<p>

<p>

     <b>Oat Cereal Case</b>. We failed to persuade a judge in Chicago to reject a class
action settlement involving
General Mills, which was sued after a contractor sprayed an unapproved pesticide on oats used
in the
company's cereals.  Although the pesticide had been approved for spraying on other cereal
products and did
not pose any health hazard to the public, General Mills agreed to end the case by promising to
redeem $10
million in new coupons which would be generally available to consumers and to pay the class
lawyers $1.75
million in cash (not coupons).  We challenged this settlement because it conferred no value on
consumers who
actually purchased the tainted cereal, and we argued that the attorney fee amounted to a
whopping $2,000 an
hour for some of the lawyers' time.  Ultimately, the judge decided that approving the settlement
would be
more beneficial to class members than letting the case go to trial, where consumers (and their
counsel) might
recover nothing.  For a variety of reasons, we have decided not to appeal.<p>

<p>

<b>  Ditlow Defense<i>.</i></b> This matter  is not a class action case, but is instead an
outgrowth of our work on GM's C/K
pickup trucks, which are the subject of the class action settlement discussed above.  In this case,
we
represented Clarence Ditlow, the director of the Center for Auto Safety, who had been a leading
critic of the
fire-prone pickups.  As a result of Ditlow's criticism of GM and its lawyers, Ditlow was the
target of a libel
action brought by one of GM's outside lawyers.  Following a discovery dispute in that litigation,
Ditlow was
harshly and unfairly sanctioned by a court in Detroit--GM's home court.  GM then used the
sanction award
against Ditlow to attack him relentlessly in the press.  We appealed the sanction to the Sixth
Circuit, which,
in a unanimous opinion, reversed the penalty against Ditlow and explained that Ditlow's conduct
had been well
within the letter of the law.  We have been informed that GM does not intend to purse this
matter any further.<p>

<p>

<center><i><A NAME="PRE">Preemption</a></i><p>

</center>
<p>

     The Constitution gives Congress the power to pass laws that supersede or "preempt" state
laws that are
inconsistent or in conflict with a federal statute or with rules issued by a federal agency.  Until
recently,
preemption questions arose infrequently, and generally in the context of complex regulatory
areas--like the
regulation of the price of natural gas. <p>

<p>

     Lately, however, preemption has become the favorite defense of manufacturers whose
products or
services are regulated in any way--even peripherally--by the federal government.  But most
federal regulatory
statutes contain no remedy at all for people injured by the regulated product.  State tort law has
historically
served that function.  Thus, if a court finds that a federal statute "preempts" state law, the injured
party is
generally left with no remedy at all.  Below we describe several of our preemption cases this
year.<p>

<p>

<b>  Maritime law</b>. As noted above, in <i>Yamaha v. Calhoun</i> we obtained a
significant Supreme Court ruling that
preserves state law claims for victims in accidents occurring in the territorial waters of the
United States. 
Although we had not handled the case in the lower courts, the Calhoun family turned to the
Litigation Group
for representation in the Supreme Court because of our dual expertise in Supreme Court practice
and
preemption law.  In our view, the key to victory was to push the Court away from Yamaha's
focus on the need
for uniformity, which it claimed could be achieved only by a federal standard (wrongly, in our
view), and
towards the goal of ensuring reasonable compensation for the families of those killed in boating
accidents. 
Our strategy paid off in an unanimous Court ruling that closely followed the argument  we
advanced.<p>

<p>

<b>  Medical Devices</b>.  For five years the Litigation Group has been fighting medical
device manufacturers
who claim that, because the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act allows their products to be
marketed,
victims of dangerous and defective medical devices have no remedy under state law.  The
manufacturers claim
that federal law "preempts" an award of compensation for victims no matter how defective the
device and no
matter how serious the patient's injury, even if it can be shown that the manufacturer defrauded
the FDA into
allowing the marketing of the device in the first place.<p>

<p>

     In several early cases, the courts were sympathetic to the companies' arguments and
threw out the claims
of patients seriously injured, or even killed, by defective medical devices.  But in 1995 we
turned the corner
with several important, although partial, victories, in which we were able to persuade federal
appeals courts
in some regions of the country that Congress never intended the medical device laws to act as a
complete bar
to state tort claims.  We knew, however, that the issue was so important as to make Supreme
Court review
inevitable.<p>

<p>

     Our most important victory came in <i>Lohr v. Medtronics</i>, a case concerning a
defective pacemaker.  A
Florida trial court ruled that the FDA's determination that Medtronic's pacemaker was
"substantially
equivalent" to pacemakers marketed prior to the enactment of the 1976 medical device law
preempted all state
law claims for damages.  The Eleventh Circuit reversed, and held that some of Lohr's state-law
tort claims
could proceed to trial.  Shortly after <i>Lohr</i>, the Ninth Circuit in California reached a more
far-reaching result,
finding no preemption of any damages claims regarding a device that the FDA had actually
approved.  Both
the Eleventh and Ninth Circuit's rulings acknowledged the division within the circuit courts on
this issue.  In
January, the Supreme Court granted review in <i>Lohr</i>, and set the case down for argument
in April.  <i>Lohr</i> should
decide the scope of federal preemption in this crucial area, a process we began years ago to
resolve the
preemption issue in a way that provides adequate protection to consumers.<p>

<center><p>

<i><A NAME="TRANS">Transportation</i> </a><b><p>

</center>
<p>

     Cars.</b>  We continue to be active participants in litigation brought by automobile
manufacturers to invalidate
a New York state law requiring manufacturers to disclose the speed at which a car's bumper
sustains serious
injury.  Federal law requires that the bumpers protect the <i>car</i> at speeds of five miles per
hour and greater,
although the bumper itself may be completely destroyed.  New York law, on the other hand,
focuses on what
happens to the bumper in low-speed collisions, because the cost of repairing a damaged bumper
may run into
hundreds or thousands of dollars, and low-speed fender-benders are all too common.  The trial
court upheld
New York's disclosure statute, but the industry appealed.  We filed an extensive <i>amicus</i>
brief and provided
substantial assistance to the state.  Argument was held in December 1995, and we expect a
decision in early
1996.<p>

<p>

<i><b>    </i>Federal Express<i>.</i></b> We are representing consumers who are suing
Federal Express for aggressively
advertising its second-day delivery as the lowest rate around, when second-day delivery was not
the least
expensive way to ship some smaller packages.  A federal judge in Tennessee held that the
consumers' claim
is preempted on the dubious theory that the Airline Deregulation Act stripped the public of the
right to sue an
airline for misrepresentation.  We have appealed, and argument is set in the Sixth Circuit in
early 1996.<p>

<p>

<i><b>    </i>Airlines.</b> We are also representing a passenger who suffered an injury
when, during the acceleration that
follows take-off, the door on a food service cart flew open and slammed against his knee.  The
airline claims
that the federal aviation laws, which provide that the Department of Transportation regulate an
airline's
"service," preempt state tort law and deprive the injured passenger of <i>any</i> remedy.  A
trial judge in Oregon
agreed, and we have appealed to the Ninth Circuit.  As in the medical device field, courts are
taking differing
positions on the question of whether this sort of personal injury relates to airline "service" so that
tort claims
are preempted.  Consequently, we are using this case and others to create sufficient conflict
among the lower
courts that the Supreme Court will be compelled to step in.<p>

<p>

<h4><center></b><A NAME="GA">GOVERNMENT
ACCOUNTABILITY</a><b> </h4>
</center>
<b>  <p>

     Clinical Laboratory Testing</b>. This case involves a major women's health issue.  In
1988, congressional
hearings revealed dangerous deficiencies in laboratory medical testing.  Congress  passed a law
to correct that
situation by, among other things, setting out tougher standards for laboratory personnel
qualifications and for
proficiency testing of cytologists, who read PAP smear slides.  Unfortunately, the regulations
issued by HHS
disregarded certain aspects of the new law, and as a consequence  were far too lax.  Because this
issue is so
crucial to women's health, we brought suit to compel HHS to follow Congress' direction
regarding laboratory
personnel qualifications and cytology proficiency testing.  <p>

<p>

     In a major ruling, the district court agreed with us and directed HHS to issue new
regulations that complied
with the law.  HHS has appealed that decision, and oral argument in the appellate court is
scheduled for
March, 1996.  <p>

<p>

<b>  Medical Device Amendments</b>. In the late 1980s, congressional hearings and reports
put a spotlight on
several weaknesses in the medical device laws and the FDA's implementation of those laws.  In
1990,
Congress amended the medical device laws to correct these deficiencies, and thus further to
protect patients
from unsafe or ineffective products.  Four years later, when the FDA had yet to implement some
of the 1990
amendments, Public Citizen sued.<p>

<p>

     Our lawsuit challenged the FDA's failure to issue regulations implementing six
provisions of the 1990 law. 
Prompted by the litigation, the FDA issued regulations for five of the provisions --not
surprisingly, those on
which our case was strongest.  In a December decision on the remaining regulation, the trial
judge rejected
the FDA's argument that Public Citizen was not a proper plaintiff but also ruled that the agency
did not
necessarily have to issue the final regulation we requested.  Having effectively won on five out
of six issues,
we decided not to appeal the one loss.<p>

<p>

<b>  Food Stamps</b>. Our efforts to settle litigation against the Department of Agriculture
are winding up.  In
1993, we won a case brought on behalf of three individuals against the USDA, challenging its
policy of cutting
food stamp benefits to those poor citizens who receive cash assistance in paying their utility
bills.  USDA
appealed, but then agreed to stop counting utility payments as income on a nationwide basis. 
Thus, we
obtained the principal relief we had been seeking--a great victory for those who rely on food
stamps.  In the
meantime, we had brought a second suit, seeking reimbursement for all individuals in South
Dakota whose
food stamp benefits were wrongly withheld under the policy.<p>

<p>

     Both the appeal and the second suit have been stayed pending settlement negotiations. 
The settlement will
provide withheld food stamps to the class of South Dakotans whose benefits were reduced under
the USDA
policy.  The settlement has been finalized and was recently presented to the Court for approval, 
which is
required under the class action rules.<p>

<p>

<b>  Generic Drugs</b>. Prescription drug manufacturers are now contending that the 1994
law, which ratified the
United States' participation in the new World Trade Organization, increased the terms of drug
patents.  This
issue is important, particularly to elderly consumers, because extending patent terms delays the
time when less
expensive, generic drugs can be brought to market.  We represent a number of consumer groups
as amici
urging a federal appeals court not to accept the manufacturers' argument that they are entitled to
a patent
extension.  The case is likely to be decided in 1996. <p>

<p>

<center><i><A NAME="FL">Food Labeling</a><b></i><p>

</center>
<p>

     </b>In 1990, Congress enacted landmark legislation--known as the Nutrition Labeling
and Education
Act--requiring food retailers to provide certain nutritional information and to make accurate
statements when
they make claims about a food's content and health effects.  In most respects, that law was
properly
implemented by the Food and Drug Administration.  The agency's implementation did, however,
leave two
significant gaps, which we have tried to compel FDA to fill.  Moreover, the statute has been
subject to attack
in a number of courts by the dietary supplement industry, and, in this regard, we have tried to
support the
FDA.<p>

<p>

<b>  Truth in Restaurant Menus</b>. Although permitted nowhere in the 1990 labeling law,
the FDA issued a
rule exempting restaurant menus from the requirement that nutrient-content claims (such as
"lean" or "low
cholesterol") and health claims ("this cereal reduces the risk of cancer") be accurate.  This
exemption has a
significant effect on consumers because about one-half of all food dollars are spent in
restaurants, and
consumers want accurate information on menus just as they do on foods they buy in retail stores. 
The
Litigation Group sued the FDA on the ground that the law does not contain an exemption for
restaurant menus,
and hence the FDA's exemption is unlawful.  Within weeks of our suit, the agency agreed to
publish a
proposed rule rescinding the menu exemption if we would put our lawsuit on hold (which we
did).  But no
sooner did we agree than the FDA reneged, leaving the menu exemption in place.  In mid-1995,
we renewed
our suit asking the court to strike down the menu exemption.  A decision is expected in early
1996.<p>

<b><p>

     Labeling of Fresh Produce and Fresh Fish.</b> Under the 1990 law, Congress allowed
labeling of fresh
produce and fresh fish to be done on a voluntary basis, without mandatory sanctions, but if, and
only if, the
grocery industry was in "substantial compliance" with labeling guidelines published by the FDA. 
The FDA
defined substantial compliance to mean compliance by only 60% of the retail food industry, and
we sued on
the ground that 60% was not "substantial compliance."  In a disappointing ruling, a federal court
of appeals
disagreed with us, holding that the FDA had acted within its discretion.  As a result, many
consumers will be
deprived of important nutritional information for fresh produce and raw fish.<p>

<p>

<b>  Challenges to the Labeling Act's Constitutionality. </b>One key component of the 1990
law is the
prohibition against food and dietary supplement manufacturers making unsupported health
claims, such as
"Omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of heart disease."  This requirement is of particular concern
to Public
Citizen since all too often consumers seek  unproven cancer preventions and cures, lured by
overblown claims
about the efficacy of health foods and supplements.  The dietary supplement industry has
challenged the
constitutionality of this portion of the statute in many courts around the country.  Representing
Public Citizen,
the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, and the Center for Science in the
Public
Interest, we have filed <i>amici</i> briefs defending the constitutionality of the Act.  Thus far,
we have been
uniformly successful, and we will continue our efforts to protect this part of the Act.<p>

<p>

<b>	Harsh Limitations Periods</b>. 1995 brought the culmination of our efforts to establish a fair statute of
limitations for workers to bring claims based on the federal plant closing law.  Several federal courts had relied
on a 1983 Supreme Court decision requiring that claims for breach of a union's duty of fair representation must
be brought in court within the six month deadline that workers have to file unfair labor practice charges with the
National Labor Relations Board.  Since 1983, we have been working to confine that approach to such "fair
representation" cases, while employers have been arguing that six months should be the standard time for filing
all labor law cases.  Building on a victory we helped obtain in 1989, which established that union democracy suits
need not be filed within six months, the Supreme Court, in a case we briefed but did not argue, held that plant
closing cases are also subject to a longer period, and the reasoning of the decision should make clear that the six
month period is very much an exception, not the rule.<p>

<p>

<b>	Preemption of State-law Labor Claims.</b>	We also continued our work against federal preemption of state
labor law claims, which dovetails with our more general preemption work discussed above.  We obtained a nice
victory in the Eighth Circuit, where a member claimed that he had been fired for filing a workers compensation
claim, and the employer was able to take his case from state court, where he had secured a preliminary injunction
of reinstatement, into federal court on the ground that his rights under a union grievance procedure superseded
his state-law rights.  We successfully argued that he could pursue his state wrongful discharge claim, but even
more important, we secured a ruling that such claims cannot be removed from state court.  Happily for our client,
but unfortunately for the development of the law, the employer decided not to take this case to the Supreme Court.<p>

<p>

<b>	Sanctions</b>. We spent substantial effort during the past year helping public interest and civil rights lawyers
avoid punitive sanctions.  In the most important of these cases, which is discussed above, we fought off an effort
by General Motors to obtain almost $50,000 in sanctions from Center for Auto Safety director Clarence Ditlow. 
In another case, referred from our Georgia office, we persuaded a trial judge to lift a smaller sanction imposed
on a civil rights lawyer for pursuing a claim that employees of a county tax office had suffered retaliation for
criticizing the authorities. In a third case, we ensured that lawyers for the Government Accountability Project
could obtain a hearing on charges that they abused a nuclear contractor in a whistleblower case (the lawyers were
cleared in a settlement reached before the hearing).<p>

<b><p>

	Teamster Election</b>. Work began in 1995 on representation of the Teamster reform movement in the
battle for re-election of the reform slate in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.  As a result of that slate's
election in 1991, Public Citizen has been able to work arm-in-arm with the Teamsters union across a broad range
of issues in Congress and the courts.  As was true during the 1991 election, the election is being held, pursuant
to a consent decree between the government and the union, under the supervision of independent court-appointed
officers.  Both because the union's status as a coalition partner is now at stake, and because important union
democracy principles are at stake, we have become deeply involved in election-related legal work.  We helped
shape the court-approved election rules and are now in the trenches on numerous allegations of election
violations.  Our principal role has been to help members pursue charges alleging that the Teamster old guard, led
by Jimmy Hoffa's son who is their candidate for president, has been using local union funds in a variety of ways
to campaign, in violation of the court-approved rules.<p>

<b></b><p>

<b>	Trade School Cases</b>. We are litigating   a number of cases for students who were victimized by fly-by-night trade schools that took advantage of the federal guaranteed student loan program.  During the late 1980's,
requirements for the federal loan program were relaxed in a way that increased the ability of vocational schools
to obtain federally funded loans for their students.  Corrupt and poorly operated schools took advantage of this
change by recruiting students with the promise that they would be trained for better paying skilled jobs.  The
training, however, was not provided, many of the schools collapsed or filed for bankruptcy when regulators
starting asking questions, and students were stuck with the obligation to repay loans for an education that they
never received. <p>

<p>

	One major issue in these cases is whether students can raise the school's misconduct as a defense to
repayment of the loan.  Financial institutions responsible for these loans have argued that the federal loan
program preempts ordinary consumer law remedies and requires students to repay the loans regardless of fraud
or other misconduct by the school.  During 1995, we persuaded the Supreme Court to tell an appellate court in
Washington, DC to take a second look at its ruling that students cannot bring lawsuits to present such defenses
to non-repayment of their loans.  At the same time, we represent the plaintiff in another action presenting this
issue that is now being appealed to the DC Circuit.  These cases present important issues concerning the scope
of consumer remedies and preemption that affect the rights and obligations of hundreds of thousands of students
who participated in the federal loan program. <p>

<p>

	We have also pursued relief in the bankruptcy court on behalf of students who attended a vocational school
that filed for bankruptcy.  During this past year, the bankruptcy court agreed with our argument that the students
who were never given notice of the bankruptcy should be given the opportunity to file claims.  Over 100 claims
have now been submitted and, during the coming year, we hope that many of the students defrauded by the school
will be able to recover a limited amount under the special priority afforded to certain consumers under the
bankruptcy laws. <p>

<p>

	Finally, under the student loan program, accrediting agencies were responsible for ensuring that schools
provide quality education, but misconduct by the accrediting agencies was a major source of abuse.  This year
we succeeded in persuading the District Court for the District of Columbia to certify a class action on behalf of
students of a local trade school to pursue a fraud claim against the accrediting agency that was responsible for
accrediting the school.  This case represents one of the first efforts to hold  an accrediting agency responsible for
the representations made concerning vocational schools under the federal loan program.	<p>

<b><p>

	Fair Credit Reporting Act</b>. At the end of 1995, we were asked to file a certiorari petition in an important
case under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  This statute was enacted by Congress to protect consumers from
inaccurate credits reports, to give consumers a right to have inaccurate reports corrected, and to empower
consumers to sue when credit agencies fail to comply with the Act.  Regrettably, the lower federal courts have
construed the Act in a grudging way, and we have taken over a case in which the Second Circuit held that a
consumer could not sue to correct an inaccurate report until after he or she has been denied credit due to the error. 
That ruling means that consumers, like our client, who try for a year to force a credit agency to correct inaccurate
information, can sue only if they take the highly irrational step of applying for credit that they know will be denied
due to the inaccurate credit report.  Because this decision is inconsistent with that of other courts of appeal, we
believe we have a chance of obtaining Supreme Court review.<p>

<p>

<b>	Corporate Governance</b>. As part of our work to promote corporate accountability, we built on a 1993 court
ruling that rebuffed Wal-Mart's efforts to exclude a shareholder proposal asking the company to prepare a report
on the company's record on equal employment opportunity and affirmative action.  In 1995, a federal appeals
court in New York ordered Wal-Mart to pay the attorneys' fees of the shareholders who submitted the resolution,
a decision which may help to deter other companies from resisting inclusion of shareholder proposals on their
proxy statements.<p>

<p>

<center><i><b>Tobacco</b></i><p>

</center>
<p>

	Another consumer protection area of great concern to us is tobacco-related litigation.  We have long been active
in tobacco issues and have represented smoking control activists, but this year has seen an intensification of those
efforts.  Our work has taken a number of forms, but all are unified by the idea that tobacco--the  nation's leading
cause of illness and death-- needs to be regulated more strictly.<p>

 <p>

<b>	FDA's Proposed Regulations</b>. During the summer of 1995, the FDA proposed to issue regulations to
make it far more difficult for minors to obtain cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products.  Labeling smoking as
a "pediatric disease," the FDA concluded that, since most smokers become addicted to tobacco products while
still in their teens, the most important public health measure it could take would be to prevent young people from
experimenting with tobacco products.  To do so, the FDA has proposed 1) restrictions that would make it more
difficult for teens to obtain tobacco products, 2) restrictions on advertising that might be accessible to minors,
and 3) a massive public education campaign.  	Although the comment period was quite brief, we recognized
the importance of the FDA's proposal and the dearth of tobacco control activists with substantial legal resources. 
Mobilizing our staff, we prepared a 160-page comment that analyzed the key legal issues underlying the FDA's
proposal: preemption, statutory questions regarding the power of the FDA to regulate tobacco, and First
Amendment issues.  Our comments were the only ones supporting the FDA's proposal that contained any
substantial legal analysis.  In contrast, the tobacco companies and their advertising industry allies inundated the
FDA with comments, one running over 2,000 pages.  We expect that once the FDA finalizes its rule, we will be
active in the litigation that will inevitably follow.<p>

<p>

<b>	Merrell Williams</b>. Mr. Williams is a former paralegal for a Louisville law firm that represented the Brown
&amp; Williamson Company, a major cigarette manufacturer.  Mr. Williams has been sued by his former employer
and Brown &amp; Williamson for copying Brown &amp; Williamson documents while he was at the law firm, and the
court entered an order forbidding Mr. Williams from discussing anything that he may have learned as a paralegal
with anyone, including his lawyers.  While we and our Louisville co-counsel finally got that order set aside as
applied to his lawyers, the company has filed criminal contempt charges against Mr. Williams for allegedly
violating the initial court order by disseminating Brown &amp; Williamson records to the media.<p>

<p>

<b>	Cliff Douglas</b>. Cliff Douglas was a key witness for ABC News in a $10 billion libel action brought against
it by Philip Morris for ABC's Day One broadcast alleging that the cigarette companies manipulate nicotine levels
in cigarettes.  Prior to the settlement of that case, we represented Mr. Douglas in his deposition, and succeeded
in staving off Philip Morris' efforts to force Mr. Douglas to reveal the identity of "Deep Cough," an industry
insider who assisted ABC.<p>

<p>

<b>	EPA Tobacco Litigation. </b>We  represent a group of public health organizations in litigation brought by the
tobacco industry to invalidate EPA's pathbreaking 1993 report on the dangers of second-hand tobacco smoke. 
We lost a preliminary battle over whether the industry's suit could be heard before the EPA had taken any final
action, and the case is proceeding through the discovery process.<p>

<HR>
<P>
The work of the Department is essentially concerned with the history of Europe, understood less as a 
collection of national histories than as a study of the complex relationships between them. Its 
approach includes comparisons with other political entities or other areas of civilization, and one of 
the Department's chairs is specifically devoted to the history of European expansion between the 
fifteenth and eighteenth centuries.<P>
The Department concentrates on the study of the period characterized by the birth of nation states and 
by the transition from traditional civilization to the civilization of industrial Europe. By tackling a 
broad range of questions over this period it proposes to contribute to the understanding of continuities 
and discontinuities in the development of Europe, and of its political, economic, social and cultural 
diversity. The Department's identity lies above all in the importance assigned to a comparative 
approach to the history of European societies, considered in their political, economic, social and 
cultural dimensions, and in the development of interdisciplinary perspectives and methodologies.<P>
The Department's teaching and research programme is necessarily selective, and does not, for 
example, include periods prior to the Renaissance. Also excluded are the History of Art, and the 
History of Ideas in the narrower sense. With these restrictions, the programme attempts to cover the 
history of European societies from the sixteenth century to the present day, with particular emphasis 
on five broad themes, four of which cover the entire period. These are: the history of European 
expansion; population, family and gender; the history of culture; the emergence of industrial society; 
and the history of European integration.<P>
Each of these five themes corresponds to a long-term research programme of the Department, and 
each programme comprises, at any given moment, a set of related projects being developed by one or 
more professors of the Department. Admission of research students is decided on merit and is not 
linked to individual professorial projects (which normally have a duration of three/four years), but 
every effort is made to integrate the thesis research of research students into the work being done in 
one or more of the research programmes. <P>
Each theme thus serves as a framework for the planning of the research seminars which are offered 
every year, taking into account as far as possible the specific interests of the students admitted in that 
year, and for defining the profiles of posts which fall vacant.<P>
In addition to the minimum formal qualifications laid down by the Institute, candidates for admission 
to the doctoral programme should normally have some postgraduate qualification or experience of 
historical research. They should submit with their application an outline of their thesis project (5-10 
pages), including an account of the sources and methodology on which it will be based. <P>
Seminars are concentrated in intensive periods of between six and eight weeks per term. Research 
students thus have every chance, outside these intensive periods, to visit archives and libraries outside 
Florence. There are currently 84 <A HREF="resstud.html">research students</A>
in the Department. In 1994 thirteen <A HREF="#doc">doctorates</A> were awarded.<P>
Since 1989 the Department has been developing a research programme in historical computing. Since 
1992 the <A HREF="#heccomp">Historical Computing Laboratory</A> has been run in 
conjunction with the Institute's Computing Centre.<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="them">A. Teaching and Research</A>
Themes</H2>
<H3><A NAME="t1">1. History of European expansion</A></H3>
On the occasion of Portugal's accession to the Institute in 1989 the National Commission for the 
Commemoration of the Discoveries, Lisbon, agreed to fund a Vasco da Gama Chair in the History of 
European Expansion, and the Department decided to include the history of European expansion as an 
explicit theme in its teaching and research programme.<P>
Teaching and research in this area is concerned with analysing the mental images of societies, of 
geographical space and of time, and the changes in these images bound up with the history of 
expansion. Special attention is paid to such themes as the transplantation of European urban 
structures beyond Europe, problems of technology (including maritime technology), social identities 
bound up with clothing, food and housing, and world trade flows, economic output, currency 
developments and political relations both among European powers and with authorities outside 
Europe.<P>
Other topics covered within this theme include patterns of migration between Europe and America 
and the cultural aspects of relations between Iberian societies and the New World.<P>
Candidates with research interests in this area will be considered for national grants on the same 
terms as other candidates. Two additional grants, funded by the Vasco da Gama Programme, are 
awarded annually by the Institute for doctoral research in the history of European expansion. No

<H3><A NAME="t2">2. Population, family and gender</A></H3>
This interdisciplinary research and teaching programme brings together distinct but complementary 
approaches to the range of problems covered by its title. They include: the statistical study of 
populations; the comparative investigation of the relations between family forms, marriage patterns 
and demographic regimes; the analysis of social and occupational structures, the active population 
and the household; the study of the ideas and attitudes conveyed by powerful agencies such as the 
home, the school, the church, the media and the state; the study of norms, values and symbolic 
representations as well as the institutional framework which shapes and categorizes all these 
issues<P>
Particular attention is devoted to marriage, which in pre-industrial societies is the key institution 
through which the intrinsic dynamics of a population are related to its social organization, and to its 
economic, legal and cultural implications. The family is studied as a social and legal institution, as 
the typical unit of production and consumption in pre-industrial societies, and as the central symbolic 
referent in the social construction of class and gender identities.<P>
Research being undertaken in this area by teaching staff exemplifies the complementarity of 
methodological approaches.<P>
One project (Hufton) focused on the complex process of <I>acculturation</I>, the construction of the 
identities of women and men in Western Europe from the 17th to the 20th centuries. It is concerned 
with analysing the ideas and attitudes conveyed by powerful agencies such as the home, the school, 
the church, the community, the peer group, the workplace, the media and the state, with the reception 
or rejection of these ideas and attitudes and hence with the part of these agencies in the identity 
formation of individuals and groups distinguished by age, class, gender, religious affiliation and 
nationality. <P>
Another project (Leboutte) is concerned with the study of demographic growth, the age-sex structures 
of the population, social and occupational structures, the active population and the household in 
European industrial basins.<P>

<H3><A NAME="t3">3. History of culture (16th to 20th centuries)</A></H3>
The history of culture seeks to understand changing practices, values, discourses and mentalities, 
whether contested or shared, through the texts, images and objects which are the sources of their 
expression.<P>
Culture is conceived in its broadest sense. It includes the patterns and forms of everyday life - 
manners and dress for example - as well as such specialised and privileged systems of thought and 
expression as the fine and applied arts and literature. All are examined in the framework of the 
cultural and educational institutions devoted to the transmission and organisation of knowledge. 
These include such bodies as the family, voluntary associations, schools and academies, the church, 
the court and the state as well as the media of oral transmission, the printed word, the graphic image 
and the symbolic object.<P>
Cultural history examines cultural practices as means of sustaining authority, establishing power and 
identity and asserting difference or distinction. It examines not only the discursive and institutional 
machinery designed to discipline bodies, thought and conduct and to create cultural hierarchies, but 
also the ways in which these were accepted, reformulated, challenged or subverted. The aim is to 
examine the distinctions between elite and popular culture, creative imagination and manual work, or 
intellectual production and cultural consumption historically, to see how these boundaries are drawn 
and how they shift over time. <P>

<H3><A NAME="t4">4. The development of industrial</A> societies and 
modern political regimes</H3>
Between late eighteenth century and our times, politics, economy, and society underwent a great 
transformation in Europe. Typical features to be studied are the birth and development of modern 
nation states, he growth of industrial economies, and the emergence of mass societies.<P>
4.1 The history of the western constitutional state includes the formation of the centralized 
administrative, juridical, civil and criminal institutions, all seen in their interrelation with social 
structures and groups; the forging of nation states, of national political systems and of national 
identities; the establishment of representative governments, electoral mechanisms, political 
associations and party systems, together with the spread of great political currents and movements 
(such as liberalism, nationalism, fascism, socialism, communism and democracy).<P>
4.2 Industrial development, particularly since the 18th century, is considered along various axes. One 
concerns economic growth at the national and regional level, overall and by sector, and its 
international diffusion (movements of goods, population and capital, technology transfers); others 
relate to the spatial dimension (urban networks, transport and communication systems and industrial 
basins, to the role of technology in the first and second industrial revolution; to the actors involved 
(firms trade unions, government and public administrations, consumers).<P>
4.3 The study of social transformation chiefly concerns the shift from societies of estates to class 
societies. This includes: (a) the formation, cohesion and change of groups and classes in their 
national, regional and local expressions; (b) the development of occupational categories and careers 
and the operation of social mechanisms as mobility and migration; (c) changes in consumption or 
production practices; (d) social differences according to position in the division of labour, sex, 
location, religion and ethnic origins.<P>

<H3><A NAME="t5">5. History of European integration</A></H3>
The history of European integration is the subject of both a research theme and a permanent research 
project financed by the Research Council of the Institute. The focus of teaching and research tends to 
shift to make full use of the potentialities afforded by the 30-year rule governing release of official 
government archives in most Community countries and the European Community itself. The archives 
of the Community are deposited at the European archives in Florence, run by the Institute, and 
provide an extra resource base for the research projects.<P>
When the permanent project on the history of the European Community started in 1983 it 
concentrated largely on the problems of the immediate post-war reconstruction, from both a national 
and an international perspective. The focus then shifted to the period 1950-58, where it attempts to 
explain the nature and timing of attempts, both successful and failed, at formalized interdependence 
in Europe. Under Professor. Grifith`s. direction the project covered not only those initiatives 
involving the 'Six' (such as the Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic Community, 
Euratom and the Political Community), but also those in the wider frameworks of the OEEC, NATO 
and GATT as well as within smaller regional sub-groupings such as the Benelux and EFTA. The 
seminars reflect these interests, but will increasingly move beyond these concerns to attempt to lay the 
groundwork for the next generation of research.<P>
Additionally from 1991 to 1995 a research project was directed by Dr <A HREF="krige.html">John Krige</A> on the topic of post-
war big science in Europe. This will focus upon how national European governments, individually 
and collectively, responded to the challenge of the USA and the USSR in the fields of high energy 
physics, atomic power and space technology. This work is supported by the availability of the 
European Space Agency archives in Florence and, indeed, the writing of ESA's history is a central 
goal of the project.<P>
In future the permaent research project on European integration will be paying more attention to 
socio-political aspects, concentrating in particular on the study of allegiance, viz. the set of factors 
that bring the citizens of a country to give their loyalty to instittutions, be they supra-national, 
international or national.<P>

<H2><A NAME="faci">B. Facilities for historians</A></H2>
<H3>1. Library</H3>
<P>
The History section of the Library is part of a relatively recent academic and research collection that 
has been built up since 1976. Its contents reflect the variety of the research that has been undertaken 
in the Department since then, covering the period from the Renaissance to the present day. The 
Library thus possesses, as its basic <I>corpus</I>, an international collection of the literature on the 
history of Europe and its component states, in all the Community languages. In particular, it has a 
solid core of reference works for bibliographic searches and works, mostly published after 1976, 
relating to the history of all European countries. Works not in the Library may be ordered on Inter-
Library Loan. The History collection itself, which is the largest in the Library, also contains a very 
extensive periodicals section, including complete collections (often dating back to 1945) of many 
journals. Books and periodicals are also kept as microfilms or microfiches, and the Library possesses, 
for example, the complete <I>Goldsmith-Kress Library</I> of economic literature from the 16th to 
the 19th Century. Computerized facilities are available for bibliographic searches and access to 
databases, and the Library has a large collection of official sources relating to the history of European 
integration.<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="heccomp">2. Historical</A> 
Computing Laboratory</H3>
The departmental programme in historical computing aims to provide programming assistance for 
staff and research students whose work makes a significant use of the computer, and to develop 
original software routines for handling particular types of source-material. Emphasis is at present 
placed on tailoring data-entry software and developing source-oriented database facilities for different 
types of research project. Current projects being developed within the programme involve computer 
analysis of, among other kinds of sources, bills of lading, parish records, cadasters, nominal census 
lists, Inquisition trial records and descriptions of <I>charivaris</I>. Particular emphasis is placed on 
information retrieval, on procedures for nominal record linkage, and on broader questions of 
historical database construction through computer analysis of demographic, judicial and notarial 
records.<P>
The programme is now based on a small Historical Computing Laboratory, run in conjunction with 
the Institute's Computing Centre by the departmental computing assistant, Mr. Michael Goerke. It is 
at present based on Macintosh and MS-DOS microcomputers, and is linked to the Institute's central 
Hewlett Packard UNIX computer. A limited number of laptop microcomputers are available for data 
entry in archives.<P>
<P>
<H3>3. Missions</H3>
Limited funds are available each year to provide assistance for research students visiting archives and 
libraries outside Tuscany. Subject to the availability of funds and supervisor's approval, research 
students can normally expect to go on three missions each year, outside the intensive seminar periods. 
The Department can usually cover travel costs and make a contribution towards subsistence 
expenses.<P>

<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/">The European University Institute </A>(EUI) is a
postgraduate research institute set up in 1976 by the Member States of the
European Union. The EUI, which is located in Fiesole, Florence, consists of four
academic departments: Economics; History and Civilisation; Law; and Political
and Social Sciences, supported by administrative, computing and library staff.
The research students of the EUI are drawn mainly from the graduates of
universities in the Member States, though some students come from Eastern
European countries, and a small number of students come to EUI from outside
Europe. Special grants from the member states, private institutions and the EUI
provide financial support for most graduate students. The academic staff of the
EUI are appointed on fixed term contracts (of maximum length four years and with
one renewal possible), and are usually on leave from their home institution.
</P>
<P>
We provide in above a description of the programme of studies in the Economics
Department, including a list of the current teaching staff and their research
interests. Further information about the EUI and application procedures is
contained in the Institute's General Prospectus which is available from:

<HR>

The identity of the department can be described in three terms:
it is <A HREF = "#european">European</A> in its character, <A HREF = "#comparative">comparative</A>
in its approach and <A HREF = "#contextual">contextual</A> in
its methods.
<P>
The European character of the activities in the Law Department
can be found in any of its research projects in different degrees
(for details see below under the individual projects). Legal problems
of the European Community are the central focus of some projects.
While in some other projects of the department, the issues of
harmonization and unification in a European perspective are not
the principal focus, their relevance is implicit in all projects,
which are all directed towards the emergence of European legal
problems and solutions. In addition to Community law, teaching
and research in the department focuses on the law of the Council
of Europe and its Member States, with special attention to the
protection of fundamental rights in Europe under the ECHR. In
thesis topics as well, the issues of European legal institutions
and the development of a body of European law are at the centre
of the department's research interests. The department cooperates
intensively with the Robert Schuman Centre and assists in an interdisciplinary
approach to problems facing the Community.
<P>
The department's approach is comparative. At present, all professors
in the department are comparative lawyers and the approach of
the projects is to compare aspects of different legal orders.
This is also true for research students' theses, for which the
comparative character of their analysis is a minimal requirement.
The fields of comparative law which the department covers are
quite broad. However, given the present size of the department,
a concentration on certain fields is necessary. The Law Department
therefore intends to focus its activities in comparative law on
the main legal problems of the political and economic systems
in Europe.
<P>
It is a characteristic feature of the Law Department that its
methods are contextual. 'Law in context' is a specific approach
to legal problems which has developed in the Law Department and
which the department intends to continue and to strengthen in
the future. Rather than analyse law in purely technical fashion,
these methods set it in its social, political and economic context.
In both teaching and-research, such disciplines as legal theory,
economic analysis of law and legal sociology therefore occupy
an important place.
<P>
The seminars and research projects of the Law Department seek
to approach the topics studied in a comparative, Community and
interdisciplinary perspective. The international background of
teaching staff, the collaboration of a large number of visiting
professors chosen for their specific competences and the active
involvement of research students from different Community countries
and university systems are all valuable here. Both research and
seminars take advantage of contributions from specialists in other
disciplines (history, political science, economics) whenever a
different academic approach seems useful for the analysis and
more detailed treatment of the topics concerned.
<H2><A NAME="org">Organization of studies</A></H2>

<H3>The Doctorate in Law</H3>

Like the three other departments, the Law Department offers a
three-year course leading to the doctorate. The general rules
governing admission and the course of doctoral studies are given
in Chapter III of this prospectus. In the first year, new research
students on the doctoral programme follow a series of seminars
jointly with LLM students, described in point (c) below.
<H3>One-year Master's Degree (LLM)</H3>

Since 1984 the European University Institute has been offering
law students a one-year programme leading to the degree of Master
in Comparative, European and International Law (comparable with
a British LLM).
<P>
The research students, counselled and supervised by a professor
in the department, participate in departmental seminars and write
a dissertation which is the basis for the conferment of the degree.
The dissertation is normally submitted at the end of the course,
but the final date for the submission of the LLM thesis is to be on 
1 October following the researcher's entry
into the programme.
<P>
Admission, residence and seminar participation requirements are
the same for LLM students as for those intending to take the doctorate.
<H2>Teaching and research themes</H2>

<H3><A NAME="european">European law</A> </H3>

Teaching and research focus upon European Community law, its links
with the law of the Council of Europe, and European economic law.
<P>
In the area of European Community law, the following topics are
emphasized- the EC legal order; institutional structure; legislative
acts and procedures; judicial remedies and judicial review; EC
law and national law; European courts and European integration;
the effectiveness of European Community law; diversity, differentiation
and subsidiarity; the dual character of supranationalism; Maastricht
and the European institutions after 1992; the Community legislative
process; levels of decision-making and their interrelation; the
implementation of Community law. Special emphasis is placed on
both the mastery of the technical aspects of law and an ability
to appreciate and analyse these aspects in their social, political
and economic context (two to three hours per week).
<P>
As well as these general questions of Community law, links with
the law of the Council of Europe are specifically treated. These
have made the protection of fundamental rights in Europe a special
focus of research being pursued on a permanent basis.
<P>
The Community's areas of action as expanded through the Single
European Act (for example, internal market, structural policies,
technological development, environmental protection, social policy
and European political cooperation) are dealt with in specific
projects and seminars. Research projects also deal with the control
of fraud against the Community, regulation of foodstuffs in the
internal market, and contextual approaches to Community law.
<P>
European economic law includes, as well as the legal rules establishing
the common market, European commercial law and European company
law.
<P>
Research students working in this area can benefit from the close
relations the Institute has with the various European institutions
represented on its Research Council (the Parliament, the Commission,
the European Court of Justice); there are possibilities of spending
trainee periods at one of these during the course of research.
They will also find very useful the conferences and symposia on
European questions organized regularly by the department or by
the Robert Schuman Centre, involving members of those institutions.

<H3><A NAME="contextual">Legal theory and law in context </A>
</H3>

Legal philosophy and legal theory are areas in which the differences
in approach among the various European legal traditions come out
most clearly and in which the renewal of ideas and approaches
has been most profound. The Institute plays an active role in
this exchange of ideas and in these debates and has hosted a number
of the outstanding figures in them at symposia and conferences
or as visiting professors, including: N. Luhmann, J. Habermas,
A. Aarnio, J. Broeckman, M. Troper, K. H. Ladeur, N. MacCormick
and R. Dworkin. The department's own work involves the theory
of autopoiesis and its possible application in law as well as
the contribution of analytical philosophy to legal reasoning and
its legal interpretation. Weinberger's and MacCormick's neo-institutionalist
theory is used towards a new definition of law and its relationship
with morality. Within this approach special attention is paid
to 'perverse' legal systems (in particular the national-socialist
one).
<P>
Among the interdisciplinary approaches special mention should
be made of the area of women's studies where the Institute has
a well-established interdisciplinary tradition and which provides
the subject for the 1994/95 European Forum (Gender and the use
of time). As far as its legal elements are concerned, work is
being done, taking into account gender in legal subjects in labour
law (notably at Community level), and on feminist approaches to
law in the context of cultural diversities.

<P>
The <STRONG>European University Institute</STRONG> is a post-graduate research
institute set up by the Member States of the European Union. Its mission is to
contribute to the development of Europe's cultural and academic heritage in both
its unity and diversity. It carries out this mission through teaching and
research at the highest university level. To date the Institute's activities in
the field of law have primarily centred around two programmes: a PhD programme
and an LLM programme.</P>
<P>
The <STRONG>Academy of European Law</STRONG>, established by the Institute in
1990, extends the Institute's traditional programmes into a larger field of
interest. The main activity of the Academy is the holding of annual summer
courses on European Law and the Protection of Human Rights in Europe. The
courses of the Academy, given by leading authorities in the respective fields,
are subsequently published by Kluwer International in an annual publication, the
<A HREF="aeltoc.html">Collected Courses of the Academy of European Law (AEL)</A>.
This year sees an innovation in the structure of the Summer Course, with the
decision to divide it into two parts. There will thus be one session on European
Union law and another on the protection of human rights in Europe. Participants
will be able to opt for participation in one session or in both. Each session is
composed of three main elements, namely: the Distinguished Lectures, delivered
by leading authorities on issues of current interest in Europe; the General
Course, covering general background information; and the specialized courses,
focusing on topics relevant to law in context.</P>
<P>
The Academy will hold its <STRONG>Eighth Session</STRONG> from 23 June to 4
July 1997 for the <STRONG>European Union Law course</STRONG> and from 7 to 18
July 1997 for the <STRONG>Human Rights course</STRONG>.</P>
<P>
The Academy also publishes the <A HREF="ejiltoc.html">'European Journal of
International Law'</A> which aims to provide a forum for debate and analysis of
current important issues within the Union, and in international law. The
<A HREF="efpb.html">European Foreign Policy Bulletin</A> publishes documents
issued in the framework of the common foreign and security policy of the
European Union.</P>
<P>
The Directors of the Florence Academy of European Law are Professors
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/LAW/alst.html">Philip Alston </A>,
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/LAW/deh.html">Renaud Dehousse</A> and
<A HREF="weiler.html">Joseph H.H. Weiler</A>.</P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="org">Organization </A></H2>
<H3>Languages </H3>
<P>
Courses are held in English and French; simultaneous translation is not
available. As participants must be able to follow courses in both of these
languages, a prerequisite for admission is a strong command of one language and
at least a passive knowledge of the other.</P>
<H3>Schedule </H3>
<P>
Courses are held every morning on weekdays and, if necessary, on some afternoons
as well. Participants are requested to stay in Florence for the entire duration
of the session. Attendance at all courses is obligatory. A certificate of
participation is issued at the end of each session.</P>
<H3>Workshops </H3>
<P>
In addition to the teaching programme, workshops are held on various topics of
current interest. These are intended for smaller groups (not more than 25 to 30
participants) and offer ample opportunity for discussion with the lecturers and
amongst the participants.</P>
<H3>Eligibility </H3>
<P>
Participation in the Summer Sessions is open to students of law and related
fields and lawyers of all nationalities. Participants should be law graduates or
have been enrolled in a recognized law programme for at least one year.
Enrolment numbers are limited and admission is based on merit. A certain number
of places are open to legal practitioners in order to increase their
understanding and appreciation of European law and human rights law and their
application and practice.</P>
<H3>Enrolment Fees </H3>
<P>
There is an enrolment fee of ECU 250 for each course, payable on acceptance of
admission. For applicants who choose to attend both courses, the fee is ECU 400.
Fees are waived for students in receipt of a scholarship.</P>
<H3>Scholarships </H3>
<P>
A limited number of scholarships are generally awarded to participants from
Eastern and Central Europe. In exceptional cases, fee-waivers may also be
granted. Decisions on scholarships and fee-waivers are at the discretion of the
Directors of the Academy and are based on need. They do not cover travel
expenses. However, several national and international organizations, for
example, the Deutsche Akademische Austauschdienst, also offer scholarships for
participation at the Summer Courses.</P>
<H3>Accommodation </H3>
<P>
The Academy assists participants in finding accommodation for their stay in
Florence. The cost of housing for a period of two weeks is estimated to be
approximately ECU 400. The Academy does not accept responsibility for hotel
reservations made on behalf of participants. Therefore, participants may be
requested to pay part of the cost in advance. Upon arrival, participants should
make arrangements for payment of hotel bills directly with the hotel manager.
Please note that the Academy does not provide medical insurance and cannot cover
medical fees. Participants are advised to purchase international medical
insurance in their home country before leaving.</P>
