<P>
The department offers, like the other departments of the EUI, a three-year
doctoral programme. This programme comprises advanced seminar courses in theory
and methodology and research seminars in the departments' different research
areas. Therefore, researchers who are admitted are expected to have already a
good theoretical and methodological background in the social sciences. The
department also admits applicants from related fields such as economics, law,
history, philosophy, linguistics and social psychology to the extent that they
have an adequate familiarity with the background literature in one or more of
the social sciences represented in the department.
</P>
<P>
Researchers who are admitted to the programme are expected to have a good
theoretical and methodological background in the social sciences in order to be
able to follow teaching on the post-graduate level. The postgraduate teaching
programme consists first of a series of seminars which comprise taught courses
and research seminars in the different areas mentioned above. Secondly, it
consists of intensive thesis supervision by a supervisor and co-supervisor
throughout the year. Thirdly, conferences, working groups and workshops
complement the activities.
</P>
<H3>Supervision of research </H3>
<P>
Researchers are assigned a provisional advisor on entering the department. By
the end of the first semester a supervisor is finally chosen. An evaluation of
progress of the researcher's work has to be given by the supervisor by April and
discussed in departmental meeting. They will then be informed by the Head of
Department if there are problem cases.
</P>
<P>
The most important institution controlling academic achievement for first year
researchers is the &quot;June Paper&quot; which is the precondition for passage
to second year. This Paper represents a first major statement of the thesis and
consists of a general statement about the content, methodology and organisation
of the work that is to be done. A detailed plan of the dissertation be should be
included. In principle, it amounts to about 40-50 pages and is to be handed in
by the beginning of June. This paper has to be judged to be of a sufficient
standard by two members of the teaching staff of the department (in exceptional
cases the second reader might be a professor outside the department in the
Institute).
</P>
<P>
In cases in which there is doubt about the standard of the &quot;June Paper&quot;
or about the other documents, a jury composed of at least six members of the
department must concur on a judgement about these materials. If they are judged
unsatisfactory in part or as a whole, the department will recommend to the
Admissions Committee that the student be asked to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
When it is judged that a limited amount of further work could bring these
materials up to the required standard, the department may recommend to the
Admissions Committee that the student be given the opportunity to work again on
the unsatisfactory materials and present the new documents in September. The
same procedure as the one adopted in June will then be followed by the
Department.
</P>
<H3>Seminar requirements </H3>
<H4>First year of study: </H4>
<P>
The departmental requirement concerning seminar participation is that first-year
researchers follow two seminars in the first semester and two seminars in the
second semester. One of these seminars may be taken outside the Department.
Researchers are required to present two seminar papers as well as a longer paper
(Junepaper) during the first year. These seminar papers are a prerequisite for
passage to the second year.
</P>
<H4>Second year of study: </H4>
<P>
Second year researchers are required to follow one seminar during the first and
second semesters. A seminar paper for one of these must be submitted as a
prerequisite for passage to the third year.
</P>
<H4>Third year of study: </H4>
<P>
Third year researchers are expected to participate in the departmental thesis
seminar. This seminar is obligatory for all researchers staying in the Institute
in their third year and beyond. It provides the venue for researchers to present
their work in the presence of their peers and supervisors, and the presentation
will be conditional to the awarding of an eventual extension of funds after the
third year, known as the completion grant.
</P>
<P>
In addition, methodological workshops (stretching over a period of three to five
days) given by specialists in the respective field are offered. These activities
are carried out in the SPS Computing Lab. Since the methodological courses
offered in the department are not obligatory, researchers will be required to
consult with their supervisors concerning whether to follow one.
</P>

<H2><A NAME=general>General Presentation</H2> 
<P>
The Robert Schuman Centre is an interdisciplinary research centre at the
European University Institute, which began its activities in September 1993,
with the aim of promoting research on the major issues confronting European
society, principally towards the construction of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Centre's programme takes the form of seminars, workshops, round tables,
conferences, and lectures, besides which, it takes the initiative for the
coordination of research projects and working groups. To this end, the Robert
Schuman Centre provides intellectual, logistical and financial support to
research initiatives, and also contributes to the strengthening of cooperation
networks in Europe and beyond, in areas which form part of its programme.
</P>
<P>
Each year, under the Fellowship Scheme, the Robert Schuman Centre reserves a
number a post-doctoral research grants for study into issues connected with the
Centre's research programme for up to one year.
</P>
<P>
Under the Jean Monnet Chair, the Centre invites distinguished persons for brief
periods, from politics, business or the academic world, to speak on subjects
which are at the heart of the Centre's research programme.
</P>
<P>
The Centre also lends its support to several working groups set up on the
initiative of research students, Jean Monnet Fellows and professors at the
Institute.
</P>
<H3>1. Research Orientations </H3> 
<P>
The Robert Schuman Centre has committed itself to a research programme for the
period 1993-1997. This is a general guideline, or framework programme, the
precise content of which is to determined during this period both by the
evolution of problems and policies in Europe and by collaboration with other
research centres. The programme is based as far possible on an
inter-disciplinary exchange between the various departments of the Institute and
their members, professors, researchers, fellows, but also on external
cooperation. Thus, the Centre introduces an &quot;added value&quot; to the
Institute's activities; the fundamental aim of the Centre is to promote the
development of original and - albeit increasingly &quot;policy-oriented - &quot;inter-disciplinary
research, which is firmly rooted in the university tradition.
</P>
<P>
The framework programme has three principal areas of enquiry:
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>1) What is Europe?<BR>
</STRONG>This area of research, which embodies one of the fundamental reasons
for the establishment of the Centre, seeks to examine the question of Europe's
identity, to select and subject to further enquiry the political problems of the
Union (public policy, institutions) and to study the relations between the
European Union and the outside world, focussing in particular on Central Europe,
the Mediterranean, and Asia.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>2) Socio-political Problems of Europe</STRONG> <BR> In this context,
the Centre's objective is to address the complex issues relating to the social
and economic transformations which are rocking the foundations of European
society. This is felt by institutions, legal systems, social structures (such as
the family, trade unions, parties, etc.), through the destabilisation of elites
and the questionning of value-systems and solidarity networks. The economic
crisis and unemployment, which result from this destabilisation process, have
consequences which go much beyond simply changing individual or collective
wealth: strains on social welfare, new forms of social exclusion, spatial
polarisation of poverty, to mention but a few. The Robert Schuman Centre aims to
set-up research projects, focussing on certain poignant issues in this respect,
including emigration and citizenship, insecurity and urban impoverishment.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>3) The &quot;Import/Export&quot; of Policies and Institutions
<BR>
</STRONG>This expression conveniently describes the processes of imitation,
exchange or mimicry governing the construction or functionning of public as well
as private systems. These phenomena may result from external domination or from
innovation by elites (political, legal, economic actors) seeking to modify the
economic or political system to which they belong. The research of the Centre
seeks not so much to assess the results of such competition, but rather to
analyse the groups mobilised in these exchanges or imitations (lawyers,
journalists, policy-makers, etc.).
</P>
<P>
Within this overall general programme, specific programmes have been created or
are currently being created. </P>

<CENTER><H1>The European Forum </H1></CENTER>
<P>
The mission of the European Forum is to bring together at the Institute for one
academic year acknowledged specialists in a given theme, favouring comparative
and interdisciplinary aspects. It furthers the co-ordination and comparison of
research at seminars attended by academics from outside the Institute, as well
as its teachers and researchers. In addition to the seminars, the Forum
organises round tables and colloquia, and concludes its work with an annual
publication. 
</P>
<P>
The Research Council and Academic Council choose a research subject from among
themes proposed by Institute professors some two years ahead, to allow those in
charge of the programme an adequate preparatory phase. Publicity and
applications begin about a year before the Forum starts, that is, in July/August
the year before its proceedings open. 
</P>
<P>
The Forum running during the academic year 1993-4 took as its theme Regional and
National Identities in Europe in the 19th and 20th Centuries, and was directed
by Professors Heinz-Gerhard Haupt (EUI, History Department and University of
Halle), Michael M&uuml;ller (EUI, History Department) and Stuart Woolf
(University of Essex).
</P>
<P>
The 1994-5 Forum was on the theme Gender and the Use of Time, and was directed
by Professors Olwen Hufton (EUI, History Department) and Yota Kravaritou (EUI,
Law Department).
</P>
<P>
The 1995-6 Forum took the theme Citizenship, and was directed by Professors
Klaus Eder (EUI, Department of Social and Political Sciences, and Humbold
Universit&auml;t, Berlin), Steven Lukes (EUI, Department of Social and Political
Sciences, and University of Sienna) and Massimo La Torre (EUI, Law Department).

</P>
<P>
The 1996-7 Forum starting in September 1996, for which this prospectus presents

and is directed by Professors Michael Artis (EUI, Department of Economics and
Robert Schuman Centre) and Ramon Marimon (EUI, Department of Economics).
</P>
<P>
The 1997-98 Forum in preparation for which this prospectus invites applications,
takes the theme <A HREF="proj97.html">International Migrations: Geography,
Politics, and Culture in Europe and Beyond</A>, and is directed by Professors
Christian Joppke (EUI, Department of Social and Political Sciences) and Ren&eacute;
Leboutte (EUI, Department of History and Civilization).
</P>

<TITLE>Starting points - legal resources on the internet</TITLE>

<META NAME="AUTHOR" CONTENT="Sieglinde Schreiner-Linford">
</HEAD>

<BODY>

<P>
The following list was compiled for the course on <I>Internet
Resources for Legal Research</I>.
<H1>Information resources for legal research:</H1>

Many sites maintain now 'hotlists' of information resources for
legal research. This list will just try to connect to some of
the most important starting points. Take things from there and
good luck with the hunt for useful information!
<P>
Some general subject indexes maintained by commercial or educational
institutions contain very good collections of links to legal information,
governmental and international organizations, news and related
areas - <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/DataSources/Top.html">THE WWW site</A>,
GNN's <A HREF="http://gnn.com/gnn/wic/index.html">The Whole Internet Catalogue</A>,
and <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</A> are perhaps the
most important. Another strategy is looking for material using
a <A HREF="http://www.iue.it/search.html">'search engine'</A>.
This is specially promising if one looks for things describable
by very concise terms.
<P>
The <A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/lii.table.html">Legal Information Institute</A>
carries the full US code, a hypertext front-end to US Supreme
Court decisions, lots of other material and entry points to their
own and other material sorted by legal topic and type or source.
<A HREF = "http://www.law.indiana.edu/law/v-lib/lawindex.html">Indiana law school </A>is
making a gallant effort to maintain a complete list of legal resources
as does <A HREF="http://lawlib.wuacc.edu/washlaw/washlaw.html">Washburn Law School Law Library</A>.
Check also <A HREF="http://www.kentlaw.edu/">Chicago Kent School of Law</A>
and the lex mundi <A HREF="http://www.hg.org/">hieros gamos</A> site.
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.un.org/">UN</A> provides not only lots
of it's own material (news, resolutions, reports and much more),
it also is the entry point for a big number of UN affiliated and
other international organizations. And just some examples of sites
that carry substantive material. Material on the work of <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/">Congress</A>,
the much mentioned <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">Whitehouse</A>
page, as well as an extensive collection of <A HREF="http://www.tufts.edu/fletcher/multilaterals.html">international treaties</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/journals.html">law journals</A>
on the net and the publicly accessible part of <A HREF="http://www.counsel.com">Lexis</A>.
<P>
There is still much less material available in Europe, than there
is in the States, but things seem to have started to move. Again
a list of starting points: <A HREF="http://www.echo.lu/">I'm Europe</A>,
of course, and some academic sites: the <A HREF="http://ltc.law.warwick.ac.uk/ltchome.html">CTI Law Technology Centre, (UK)</A>
and the <A HREF = "http://www.jura.uni-sb.de/">Homepage des Servers www.jura.uni-sb.de</A>,
a Norvegian site concentrating on <A HREF="http://ananse.irv.uit.no/trade_law/nav/trade.html">trade law</A>
and a collection of <A HREF="http://home.pages.de/~anzinger/govt/europa.html">government and other political sites</A>
in Europe.
<P>
<A HREF = "http://www.lib.uchicago.edu:80/~llou/lawlists//info.html">Law Lists</A>
is a list of electronic discussion groups related to law, maintained
by Lyonette Louis-Jacques, while <A HREF = "http://www.kentlaw.edu/lawnet/lawnet.html">The Legal Domain Network</A>
gives access to some of those discussion groups without subscription.
Erik J. Heels' <A HREF="http://www.lcp.com/The-Legal-List">Legal List</A>
tries to keep up with different kinds of online legal resources.

<P>
For your convenience some of the resources available on the Internet
have been listed under broad category headings (subject area,
types of resource and geographical area). The contents are not
exhaustive; if you want to go to somewhere that contains links
to almost everything of interest to social and political scientists,
try one of the resources listed under &quot;Crown Jewel sites&quot;.

<H2>What is the European University Institute?</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>
The European University Institute was founded in 1976 by the European
Community Member States to provide advanced academic and cultural
training on a European basis. It does research in a European perspective
(fundamental research, comparative research and Community research)
in the human and social sciences: history, law, economics, political
and social sciences. Its full-time teaching staff and 330 research
students come from all countries of the European Union. Its Principal
is Dr Patrick Masterson, formerly President of University College,
Dublin. 
<UL>
<LI>It welcomes research students, for periods from one to three
years, who wish either to:<B> </B>
<LI>take the Institute's doctorate (normally three years); 
<LI>take the LL M in comparative, European and international law;
<LI>or exceptionally, spend one or two years' doctoral training
at the Institute before defending a thesis in their home university.
</UL>
<P>
Teaching is largely in English (with some seminars in French)
and there are excellent opportunities to improve or add to your
language capabilities. The EUI has good links with the Commission
in Brussels (e.g. for traineeships, access to data, etc.). Three-year
grants are available to all UK students accepted (even when previous
State support has been given, e.g. for an MA course).<B> </B>
<H2>How do I apply to study at the EUI?</H2>
<P>
In order to be accepted as a graduate student at the Institute,
you need to have the same level of qualification as for an equivalent
programme in a British university (normally a good upper second
degree). Applications are made on forms which are obtainable from
the Institute (<A HREF="../Servac/Welcome.html">Academic Service</A>) 
and should be made
by 31 January 1997. Students in their final year of undergraduate
study may apply for a place and an award. Applicants of acceptable
quality are interviewed in April in the department and definite
decisions are made on the award of both a place and a scholarship
in April. These may be conditional on the results obtained in
your final examinations.
<H2>Will I get a scholarship?</H2>
<P>
For British students, the Department for Education and Employment
makes available every year a certain number of research awards
tenable at the Institute. These awards are made on similar terms
to national awards, but students who have already received State
support for a postgraduate course may, nevertheless, be considered
for a full three-year grant for research for a Ph.D. at the EUI.
These awards are for two years, but the Institute gives an equivalent
grant to third-year students. In the academic year 1996/97, the
value of the awards is LIT 1 600 000 monthly. In addition, there
is an allowance for travel to and from Italy and for health insurance.
A similar agreement exists with all the other Member States of
the European Union. Norway and Switzerland also award national
grants.
<H2>Department of History and Civilization </H2>
<P>
The department is unified through the major emphasis given to
the history of societies in Europe in a comparative perspective.
The work is chiefly on the modern and contemporary periods. Priority
goes to five main themes:
<P>
<EM>The history of European expansion (15th to 18th centuries)</EM>
<P>
To mark the formal accession of Portugal to the Institute in 1989,
the Portuguese National Committee for the Commemoration of the
Discoveries has endowed the Vasco de Gama Chair in the History
of European Expansion. This theme pays particular attention to
the economic and cultural aspects of the process of expansion
and its consequences.
<P>
<EM>Population, family, society (16th to 20th centuries)</EM>
<P>
The theme seeks to combine and articulate the approaches, methodological
assumptions and techniques of social history, historical demography
and social anthropology. It includes a further methodological
dimension, corresponding to the development and exploration of
methods of computer analysis of historical source-material, not
only as regards techniques of nominal record linkage (as in family
historical database reconstitution) but also extending to broader
questions of historical database construction through computer
analysis of demographic, judicial and notarial records.
<P>
<EM>The cultural history of Europe from the 16th to the 20th century</EM>
<P>
This study theme has two main aims:<BR>
to understand, through practices, habits and objects, the cultural
diversity of Europe, without favouring intellectuality or aesthetic
aspects, and with a stress on the formation, circulation and exchange
of representations (the history of mentalities);<B> <BR>
</B>to maintain coherence with other research fields through the
attention paid to social aspects of cultural history.
<P>
<EM>The emergence of industrial society in Western Europe</EM><B>
</B><EM>(16th to 20th centuries)</EM><B> </B>
<P>
This wide research theme considers the causes, nature and timing
of economic development, the impact of these changes on the daily
life of men and women caught up in them, and the political forms
which their reaction often took.
<P>
<EM>The history of European integration</EM> 
<P>
The history of European integration is the subject of both a research
theme and a permanent research project financed by the Research
Council of the Institute. The focus of teaching and research tends
to shift to make full use of the potential afforded by the 30-year
rule governing release of official government archives in most
Community countries and the European Community itself. The archives
of the Community are deposited at the European archives in Florence,
run by the Institute, and provide an extra resource base for the
research projects.
<H2>Department of Economics </H2>
<P>
The department aims to give students advanced training in the
disciplines of economics and econometrics essential to professional
economists. It also pursues research in the following areas.
<P>
<EM>Microeconomic theory and analysis</EM> 
<P>
Microeconomic theory is particularly well represented in the department.
Specific research areas are general equilibrium theory, oligopoly
theory and the economics of imperfect competition, game theory,
social choice, welfare economics and financial economics
<P>
<EM>Macroeconomics and economic policy</EM>
<P>
Research interests in this general area include the application
of differential game theory to macro-issues in general and, in
particular, to international policy coordination, monetary policy
and inflation, wage bargaining, credibility learning, refinements
of the rational expectations hypothesis, financial markets and
exchange-rate stabilization mechanism, as well as the operation
of the European Monetary System.
<P>
<EM>Econometrics</EM> 
<P>
The main focuses of the department in this area are: (1) the application
of time-series methods to economic data, the analysis of seasonality,
trends, and cycles; (2) the development of new econometric procedures,
particularly in the areas of co-integration and error correction
models; and (3) the applications of macroeconometric techniques
for panel data and limited dependent variable models. Additional
research interests include econometric modelling methodology,
the application of differential geometry to econometrics and the
econometric implications of non-linear phenomena.
<P>
<EM>Industrial economics</EM> 
<P>
In this area, research deals with the impact of product differentiation
on market performance, the determinants of firm-specific market
power, applications of game theory to industrial economics, the
economics of imperfect information, the pricing of natural resources,
the interaction between Community policy on State aid and Community
competition policy.
<P>
<EM>International economics</EM> 
<P>
Research interests include: economic and monetary union in the
European Community; exchange-rate theory and stabilization through
target zones and the European Monetary System; international transmission
of business cycles; and international policy cooperation.
<P>
<EM>Labour economics</EM> 
<P>
Both macroeconomic and microeconomic aspects of labour economics
are considered. Particular attention is paid to the modelling
of unemployment duration in West and East European countries;
the analysis of social security benefits; links between labour
productivity and the economic cycle; and the inequality of earnings
and incomes in Eastern Europe.
<H2>Department of Law</H2>
<P>
<EM>European law</EM> 
<P>
Much of the work sets questions of Community law at the very heart
of research. In other cases, the European Community is the framework
for examination of the opportunities and limitations of European
integration. Another strong point is the protection of fundamental
rights through the European Convention on Human Rights. 
<P>
Research students working on this theme can benefit from the close
relations the Institute has with the various European institutions
represented on its Research Council (Parliament, Council, Commission,
European Court of Justice); there are possibilities to spend training
periods at one of these during the course of research.
<P>
<EM>International law and comparative law</EM> 
<P>
The object of research in the department is frequently to compare
different legal systems from one aspect or another. The disciplines
of comparative law and international law best represented in it
are essentially:
<P>
- relations between different levels of legal order;<B> <BR>
</B>- law of human rights and development law;<B> <BR>
</B>- comparative labour law and industrial relations;<B> <BR>
</B>- environment law;<B> <BR>
</B>- comparative commercial law;<B> <BR>
</B>- comparative constitutional law.
<P>
<EM>Legal theory and interdisciplinary approaches</EM> 
<P>
Law in context is a specific approach to legal problems which
has developed in the department and which it intends to continue.
As opposed to a more technical and doctrinal style of legal analysis,
this approach insists on analysing legal phenomena in their social,
political and economic context. The department gives high priority
to fields such as law and economics, law and society, and legal
theory. Among the interdisciplinary approaches, special mention
should be made of the area of women's studies where the Institute
has a well-established interdisciplinary tradition. Current research
includes legal philosophy and contemporary legal thought.<B> </B>
<H2>One-year Master's degree in law </H2>
<P>
In addition to the doctoral programme, the Law Department is offering
law students a one-year programme leading to the degree of Master
of Comparative, European and International Law (comparable with
a British LL M). Admission, residence and seminar participation
requirements are the same for LL M students as for those intending
to take the doctorate. Research students may request to switch
from the LL M to the Ph.D. programme (or vice versa).
<H2>Department of Political and Social Science </H2>
<P>
The department aims at a balance between theoretical and practical
approaches, between fundamental research and a more pragmatic
approach towards the problems of defining policies in a national
or European framework.
<P>
<EM>Comparative political institutions and public policy</EM>
<P>
The department has a long tradition of research in this field
covering such topics as political parties, electoral behaviour,
governmental decision-making processes, theories of public choice,
and the analysis of regional, social and environmental policies.
Emphasis is put on a strong theoretical and methodological orientation
in this area.
<P>
<EM>Public policies</EM> 
<P>
This area covers theoretical studies of policy-making as well
as the analysis of specific policy areas such as regional, social,
environmental, transport and infrastructure policies on the national,
European Union and international levels. Special emphasis is placed
on neo-institutional approaches. 
<P>
<EM>European integration and its international context</EM> 
<P>
Topics covered in the field of the politics of European integration
include the institutional framework of the European Union; the
Union's external relations and European political cooperation;
the interaction between EU policies and those of Member States,
at the national and subnational levels; and the role of political
parties, interest groups and administrations in the formulation
and execution of European policies. In the field of international
relations, the department's work has a particular tradition in
international political economy which also includes a strong theoretical
component.
<P>
<EM>Comparative social and political dynamics of modern societies</EM>
<P>
Work in this area focuses on the study of the social and political
dynamics of modern societies. It includes studies of collective
mobilization in fields such as environmental protest, nationalism
and regionalism, issue formation and agenda setting in public
discourse, transition processes in the Western nation-States and
post-communist Eastern Europe, and the relation of these processes
to democratic theory.
<P>
<EM>Comparative social institutions and social inequality</EM>
<P>
Within this area, research focuses on the analysis of the relationships
between various aspects of social inequality and social policy,
specifically the welfare state. It includes the study of social
mobility, the sociology of education, labour-market behaviour,
and gender related aspects of social stratification.
<P>
<EM>Social and political theory</EM> 
<P>
Various types of theoretical enquiry are pursued in the department:
the critical analysis of liberal and socialist ideas; democratic
theory with particular reference to recent trends in theories
of political representation; theories of rational choice, their
limits and alternatives; contractarianism, classical and recent;
theories of power and subjectivity; and topics in the history
of political thought, especially in relation to the emergence
of the modern State.<B> </B>
<H2>The Robert Schuman Centre </H2>
<P>
The Robert Schuman Centre, directed by Professor Yves M&eacute;ny,
began its official activities in 1993. It develops research bearing
on the main policy issues which confront contemporary European
society, principally the construction of Europe. Thanks to the
existence of joint Chairs of Department, the Centre pursues work
on economic policies in Europe, international relations (especially
security), Central and Eastern Europe, and the history of government-social
relations since 1945. 
<P>
Aditionally The Centre's activities are organized around the Jean
Monnet Chair attached to the Centre, which brings eminent people
from both the academic world and outside to the Institute, either
to teach for several months or to lecture on the latest developments
in European integration.<B> </B>
<H2>The European Forum </H2>
<P>
Its task is to bring together at the Institute, in a given academic
year, high-level experts on a chosen subject giving prominence
to international, comparative and interdisciplinary aspects of
the subject. The theme chosen for 1996/97 (under the academic
direction of Professors Leboutte and Joppke is &quot;Migrations&quot;.
The Forum also organizes seminars for researchers at the Institute.<B>
</B>
<H2>Jean Monnet Fellowships </H2>
<P>
The Institute awards some 20 postdoctoral fellowships each year
to recent doctors or established academics on sabbatical, working
in the fields listed in this folder. Further information and application
forms are available from Mr Dominique Delaunay at the Institute
(e-mail: delaunay@datacomm.iue.it).<B> </B>

<H2>&#191;Qu&eacute; es el Instituto Universitario Europeo? </H2>
</center>
<HR>
<P>
El Instituto Universitario Europeo, fundado en 1976 por los Estados miembros de
la Comunidad Europea, tiene como objetivo principal el proporcionar una formaci&oacute;n
cient&iacute;fica y cultural europea. En &eacute;l se llevan a cabo
investigaciones en el marco de una perspectiva europea (investigaci&oacute;n b&aacute;sica,
comparada y comunitaria) en ciencias humanas y sociales: historia, derecho,
econom&iacute;a y ciencias pol&iacute;ticas y sociales. Su cuerpo docente y sus
330 estudiantes-investigadores provienen del conjunto de pa&iacute;ses de la Uni&oacute;n
Europea. El Instituto est&aacute; presidido por el profesor Patrick Masterson,
ex presidente del University College, Dubl&iacute;n. El Instituto acoge, por per&iacute;odos
de uno a tres a&ntilde;os, a estudiantes-investigadores que desean</P>
<UL>
<LI>preparar el doctorado del Instituto (duraci&oacute;n: tres a&ntilde;os);
</LI>
<LI>obtener el Diploma de Estudios Jur&iacute;dicos (DEJ) en Derecho comparado,
europeo e internacional con un nivel comparable a un DEA franc&eacute;s o un
master ingl&eacute;s;
</LI>
<LI>en casos excepcionales, completar, con una estancia de uno o dos a&ntilde;os
en el Instituto, su formaci&oacute;n profesional antes de presentar la tesis
correspondiente en su universidad de origen. 
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
La docencia se lleva a cabo en su mayor parte en ingl&eacute;s (con algunos
seminarios en franc&eacute;s) y se ofrecen excelentes oportunidades para mejorar
o ampliar conocimientos ling&uuml;&iacute;sticos. El IUE tiene buenos contactos
con la Comisi&oacute;n en Bruselas (por ejemplo, para per&iacute;odos de pr&aacute;cticas,
acceso a datos, etc.).</P>
<H2>Condiciones para las candidaturas y las becas</H2>
<P>
S&oacute;lo pueden ser admitidos en el Instituto los candidatos que posean una
licenciatura. No es necesario estar en posesi&oacute;n de &eacute;sta en el
momento de solicitar la candidatura (fecha l&iacute;mite: 31 de enero de 1997)
pero s&iacute; es indispensable para la admisi&oacute;n definitiva en el
Instituto (1 de septiembre de 1997). Los resultados de la admisi&oacute;n se
comunicar&aacute;n a los candidatos en el mes de abril.<BR>
</P>
<P>
Los investigadores admitidos en el Instituto disfrutar&aacute;n de una beca del
Gobierno espa&ntilde;ol para el primer y el segundo a&ntilde;o de doctorado, as&iacute;
como para el DEJ, y de una beca del Instituto para el tercer a&ntilde;o. Las
mensualidades de tales becas para el a&ntilde;o acad&eacute;mico 1996-1997 son,
respectivamente, de 135&amp;nbsp;000 pesetas y de 1&amp;nbsp;680&amp;nbsp;000
liras. Se incluye, adem&aacute;s, una bolsa de viaje y un seguro de enfermedad</P>
<P>
Los candidatos espa&ntilde;oles deben solicitar un impreso de solicitud especial
al Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores y devolverlo debidamente completado antes
del 31 de enero a la misma direcci&oacute;n.
<BR>
</P>
<H2>Historia y civilizaci&oacute;n</H2>
<P>
La homogeneidad del departamento resulta de la importancia que se otorga a la
historia de las sociedades europeas, en una perspectiva comparada. Los trabajos
se realizan principalmente sobre el per&iacute;odo moderno y contempor&aacute;neo.
Destacan cinco grandes temas: 
</P>
<P>
<EM>Historia de la expansi&oacute;n europea (siglos XVI y XVII)</EM></P>
<P>
Con motivo de la entrada de Portugal en el Instituto en 1989, el comit&eacute;
nacional portugu&eacute;s para la conmemoraci&oacute;n de los grandes
descubrimientos dot&oacute; al Instituto con la c&aacute;tedra Vasco de Gama de
historia de la expansi&oacute;n europea. Este tema presta particular atenci&oacute;n
a los aspectos econ&oacute;micos y culturales de la historia de la expansi&oacute;n
europea y sus consecuencias.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Poblaci&oacute;n, familia y sociedad (siglos XVI a XX)</EM></P>
<P>
Este tema, en gran parte interdisciplinario (historia social, demograf&iacute;a
hist&oacute;rica, antropolog&iacute;a social), comprende una dimensi&oacute;n
metodol&oacute;gica importante, con el desarrollo y la utilizaci&oacute;n de m&eacute;todos
de an&aacute;lisis inform&aacute;tico de las fuentes hist&oacute;ricas. Trata
tambi&eacute;n de las relaciones entre sexos y laborales desde el siglo XVI y de
las relaciones entre industrializaci&oacute;n y desarrollo demogr&aacute;fico.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Historia cultural de Europa (siglos XVI a XX)</EM></P>
<P>
Este tema de estudio tiene dos objetivos espec&iacute;ficos:</P>
<P>
- comprender a trav&eacute;s de las tradiciones, las costumbres y los objetos,
la diversidad cultural de Europa, sin privilegiar la intelectualidad o la est&eacute;tica
e insistiendo en las representaciones, su circulaci&oacute;n e intercambio
(historia de las mentalidades);</P>
<P>
- la voluntad de conservar una coherencia con otros campos de investigaci&oacute;n,
por la atenci&oacute;n proporcionada a los aspectos sociales de la historia
cultural.</P>
<P>
- El surgimiento de la sociedad industrial en la Europa occidental (siglos XVI a
XX)</P>
<P>
Este campo de investigaci&oacute;n y de formaci&oacute;n considera los or&iacute;genes,
las causas, la naturaleza y los ritmos del desarrollo econ&oacute;mico, el
impacto de esos cambios econ&oacute;micos en la vida cotidiana de los hombres y
mujeres que los vivieron, las formas pol&iacute;ticas en que se desenvuelven.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Historia de la integraci&oacute;n europea</EM></P>
<P>
Dicha historia es un proyecto de investigaci&oacute;n permanente del Instituto.
La ense&ntilde;anza y la investigaci&oacute;n est&aacute;n orientadas a sacar el
mejor partido posible de la que regula el acceso a los archivos p&uacute;blicos.
Los archivos comunitarios se encuentran depositados en el archivo europeo de
Florencia, gestionado por el Instituto, ofreciendo material complementario para
los proyectos de investigaci&oacute;n
</P>
<H2>Econom&iacute;a
</H2>
<P>
El departamento tiene como objetivo proporcionar a sus investigadores una
formaci&oacute;n en profundidad en las disciplinas de la econom&iacute;a y de la
econometr&iacute;a, que son esenciales para los economistas. Adem&aacute;s,
realiza sus trabajos dentro de las siguientes &aacute;reas. 
</P>
<P>
<EM>Teor&iacute;a y an&aacute;lisis microecon&oacute;mico</EM></P>
<P>
La teor&iacute;a microecon&oacute;mica est&aacute; bien representada en el seno
del departamento. Las &aacute;reas espec&iacute;ficas de investigaci&oacute;n
son la teor&iacute;a del equilibrio general y sus desarrollos, teor&iacute;a del
oligopolio y la competencia imperfecta, la teor&iacute;a de los juegos, la teor&iacute;a
de la decisi&oacute;n (teor&iacute;a de las elecciones racionales, teor&iacute;as
de las elecciones colectivas), la econom&iacute;a del bienestar y la econom&iacute;a
financiera.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Teor&iacute;a y pol&iacute;tica macroecon&oacute;mica</EM></P>
<P>
Este &aacute;rea cubre esencialmente la aplicaci&oacute;n de la teor&iacute;a de
los juegos a temas macroecon&oacute;micos en general, y en particular a la
coordinaci&oacute;n internacional de las pol&iacute;ticas macroecon&oacute;micas,
pol&iacute;tica monetaria e inflaci&oacute;n, negociaciones de salarios,
desarrollo de la teor&iacute;a de las expectativas racionales, mercados
financieros y mecanismos de estabilizaci&oacute;n de los tipos de cambio, as&iacute;
como la evoluci&oacute;n del sistema monetario europeo. 
</P>
<P>
<EM>Econometr&iacute;a</EM></P>
<P>
En este &aacute;rea, los trabajos se concentran especialmente en el an&aacute;lisis
de: 1) la aplicaci&oacute;n de m&eacute;todos de series temporales a datos econ&oacute;micos,
el an&aacute;lisis de oportunidad, tendencias y ciclos; 2) el desarrollo de
nuevos procedimientos econom&eacute;tricos, en especial en las &aacute;reas de
cointegraci&oacute;n y modelos de correcci&oacute;n de errores, y 3) la aplicaci&oacute;n
de t&eacute;cnicas macroecon&oacute;micas a tablas de datos y modelos IDV. Otros
intereses de investigaci&oacute;n incluyen los m&eacute;todos de construcci&oacute;n
de modelos econom&eacute;tricos, la aplicaci&oacute;n de la geometr&iacute;a
diferencial a la econometr&iacute;a y las implicaciones de los fen&oacute;menos
no lineales.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Econom&iacute;a industrial</EM></P>
<P>
Este tema cubre el impacto de la diferenciaci&oacute;n de productos sobre los
resultados comerciales, los factores de expansi&oacute;n de las empresas en los
mercados, las aplicaciones de la teor&iacute;a de los juegos a la econom&iacute;a
industrial, la econom&iacute;a de informaci&oacute;n incompleta, la fijaci&oacute;n
de precios a los recursos naturales y la interacci&oacute;n entre las pol&iacute;ticas
comunitarias de ayuda industrial y de competencia.</P>
<P>
<EM>Econom&iacute;a internacional</EM></P>
<P>
La investigaci&oacute;n en este &aacute;rea incluye: la uni&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica
y monetaria de la Comunidad Europea; teor&iacute;a de los tipos de cambio y de
su estabilizaci&oacute;n por medio de zonas indicativas y del sistema monetario
europeo; transmisi&oacute;n internacional de los ciclos econ&oacute;micos, y la
pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n internacional.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Econom&iacute;a del trabajo</EM></P>
<P>
Este &aacute;rea cubre los aspectos tanto macroecon&oacute;micos como microecon&oacute;micos
de la econom&iacute;a del trabajo. En ella se presta especial atenci&oacute;n a
los modelos de la duraci&oacute;n del desempleo en los pa&iacute;ses de la
Europa oriental y occidental; al an&aacute;lisis de los seguros sociales; a la
relaci&oacute;n entre la productividad laboral y los ciclos econ&oacute;micos, y
la desigualdad de salarios e ingresos en la Europa oriental.
</P>
<H2>Derecho
</H2>
<P>
Tres elementos caracterizan los trabajos del departamento de derecho y
constituyen la base de los tres grandes temas que desarrolla: car&aacute;cter
europeo, &oacute;ptica comparativa y m&eacute;todo contextual.</P>
<P>
<EM>Derecho europeo</EM></P>
<P>
El Derecho comunitario constituye el n&uacute;cleo central de numerosos
trabajos. Para otros, la Comunidad Europea es el marco en el cual se examinan
las posibilidades y los l&iacute;mites de una integraci&oacute;n jur&iacute;dica
europea. Otro aspecto importante es la protecci&oacute;n de los derechos
fundamentales por el Convenio Europeo para la Protecci&oacute;n de los Derechos
Humanos y de las Libertades Fundamentales.</P>
<P>
Los investigadores que trabajan en ese tema se benefician de las estrechas
relaciones que el Instituto mantiene con las diferentes instituciones europeas
representadas en el consejo de investigaci&oacute;n del Instituto (Parlamento,
Consejo, Comisi&oacute;n, Tribunal de Justicia), en el seno de las cuales es
posible efectuar un per&iacute;odo de pr&aacute;cticas durante la investigaci&oacute;n.</P>
<P>
<EM>Derecho internacional y Derecho comparado</EM></P>
<P>
La finalidad de las investigaciones del departamento es a menudo la comparaci&oacute;n
de uno u otro aspecto de los diferentes sistemas jur&iacute;dicos. Las
disciplinas mejor representadas en Derecho comparado y en Derecho internacional
son:</P>
<P>
- las relaciones entre los diferentes niveles de los sistemas jur&iacute;dicos;
<BR> - los derechos humanos y el derecho al desarrollo; <BR> - el derecho
comparado del trabajo; <BR> - el derecho del medio ambiente; <BR> - el derecho
comercial comparado; <BR> - derecho constitucional comparado.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Teor&iacute;a del Derecho y m&eacute;todos pluridisciplinarios</EM></P>
<P>
El departamento se caracteriza por su enfoque contextual de los problemas
legales. En lugar de un an&aacute;lisis jur&iacute;dico puramente t&eacute;cnico
y doctrinal, estos m&eacute;todos destacan el an&aacute;lisis del fen&oacute;meno
jur&iacute;dico en su contexto social, pol&iacute;tico y econ&oacute;mico. Tanto
en la ense&ntilde;anza como en la investigaci&oacute;n, disciplinas como la teor&iacute;a
del derecho, el an&aacute;lisis econ&oacute;mico del derecho o la sociolog&iacute;a
jur&iacute;dica tienen un lugar importante. En este &aacute;mbito merece
especial atenci&oacute;n el &aacute;rea de estudio sobre el mundo de la mujer,
que goza de una s&oacute;lida tradici&oacute;n interdisciplinaria en el
Instituto. La investigaci&oacute;n actual incluye la filosof&iacute;a del
derecho y el pensamiento jur&iacute;dico contempor&aacute;neo.
</P>
<H2>Diploma de un a&ntilde;o en Derecho
</H2>
<P>
Adem&aacute;s del programa doctoral, el departamento de derecho propone un ciclo
de un a&ntilde;o para el Diploma de Estudios Jur&iacute;dicos (DEJ) en Derecho
comparado europeo e internacional, cuyas condiciones de admisi&oacute;n son las
mismas que para el doctorado. Se permite a los investigadores solicitar el
cambio del programa del diploma al de doctorado, o viceversa, solicitudes que
normalmente son aceptadas.
</P>
<H2>Ciencias pol&iacute;ticas y sociales
</H2>
<P>
El departamento busca un equilibrio entre la teor&iacute;a y la pr&aacute;ctica,
entre investigaci&oacute;n b&aacute;sica y una orientaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s
pragm&aacute;tica de cara a los problemas de definici&oacute;n de las pol&iacute;ticas
en un marco nacional o europeo.</P>
<P>
<EM>Instituciones pol&iacute;ticas comparadas y pol&iacute;tica p&uacute;blica</EM></P>
<P>
El departamento tiene una larga tradici&oacute;n de investigaci&oacute;n en este
campo, que cubre temas como partidos pol&iacute;ticos, conducta electoral,
procesos de decisi&oacute;n de los gobiernos, teor&iacute;a de la elecci&oacute;n
p&uacute;blica y an&aacute;lisis de pol&iacute;ticas regionales, sociales y
medioambientales. Se acent&uacute;a una orientaci&oacute;n te&oacute;rica y
metodol&oacute;gica.</P>
<P>
<EM>An&aacute;lisis de las pol&iacute;ticas p&uacute;blicas</EM></P>
<P>
Este &aacute;rea cubre estudios te&oacute;ricos sobre los mecanismos de toma de
decisiones y tambi&eacute;n estudios pr&aacute;cticos sobre sectores
particulares como la pol&iacute;tica regional, la pol&iacute;tica social, la pol&iacute;tica
de transportes o del ambiente. Se acent&uacute;a especialmente el enfoque
neo-institucionalista.</P>
<P>
<EM>Integraci&oacute;n europea y su contexto internacional</EM></P>
<P>
Este campo de estudios cubre temas como el marco institucional de la Uni&oacute;n
Europea; las relaciones externas de la Uni&oacute;n y la cooperaci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica
europea; la interacci&oacute;n entre las pol&iacute;ticas de la Uni&oacute;n
Europea y las de los Estados miembros a niveles nacionales y subnacionales, y el
papel de los partidos pol&iacute;ticos, grupos de inter&eacute;s y
administraciones en la formulaci&oacute;n y ejecuci&oacute;n de las pol&iacute;ticas
europeas. En el &aacute;mbito de las relaciones internacionales, el trabajo del
departamento tiene una tradici&oacute;n particular en pol&iacute;tica econ&oacute;mica
internacional, con un fuerte componente te&oacute;rico.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Din&aacute;micas sociales y pol&iacute;ticas comparadas de las sociedades
modernas</EM></P>
<P>
Este &aacute;mbito de trabajo se concentra en el estudio de las din&aacute;micas
sociales y pol&iacute;ticas de las sociedades modernas. Incluye estudios de la
movilizaci&oacute;n colectiva en &aacute;mbitos tales como el de la protesta
medioambiental, nacionalismo y regionalismo, elecci&oacute;n de temas de debate
p&uacute;blico, procesos de transici&oacute;n en los Estados-naci&oacute;n
occidentales y en la Europa oriental poscomunista, as&iacute; como la relaci&oacute;n
de estos procesos con la teor&iacute;a democr&aacute;tica.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Instituciones sociales comparadas y desigualdad social</EM></P>
<P>
En este &aacute;rea la investigaci&oacute;n se concentra en el an&aacute;lisis
de las relaciones entre diversos aspectos de la desigualdad social y la pol&iacute;tica
social, espec&iacute;ficamente el Estado del bienestar. Incluye el estudio de la
movilidad social, la sociolog&iacute;a de la educaci&oacute;n, el comportamiento
del mercado de trabajo, y aspectos de la estratificaci&oacute;n social
relacionados con la diferencia de sexo.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Teor&iacute;a social y pol&iacute;tica</EM></P>
<P>
El departamento prosigue varios tipos de investigaci&oacute;n te&oacute;rica: el
an&aacute;lisis cr&iacute;tico de las ideas liberales y socialistas a la luz del
desarrollo de la filosof&iacute;a moral y pol&iacute;tica contempor&aacute;nea;
la teor&iacute;a democr&aacute;tica, con particular referencia a las recientes
tendencias en la teor&iacute;a de la representaci&oacute;n; teor&iacute;as de la
elecci&oacute;n racional, sus l&iacute;mites y sus alternativas;
contractualismo, cl&aacute;sico y reciente; teor&iacute;as del poder y la
subjetividad, y temas dentro de la historia del pensamiento pol&iacute;tico,
especialmente en relaci&oacute;n con el nacimiento del Estado moderno. 
</P>
<H2>Centro Robert Schuman
</H2>
<P>
El Centro Robert Schuman, dirigido por el professor Y. M&eacute;ny, inici&oacute;
oficialmente sus actividades en 1993. Es un centro de investigaciones consagrado
a las grandes cuestiones a las que se enfrenta la&amp;nbsp;sociedad europea
contempor&aacute;nea, y en especial sobre laconstrucci&oacute;n europea. Gracias
a la existencia de c&aacute;tedras conjuntas con un departamento, el Centro
lleva a cabo trabajos sobre las pol&iacute;ticas econ&oacute;micas en Europa,
sobre las relaciones internacionales (y especialmente sobre las cuestiones de
seguridad), sobre temas relacionados con Europa Central y Oriental, y sobre la
historia de las relaciones entre los poderes p&uacute;blicos y la sociedad desde
1945. Adem&aacute;s, las actividades del Centro se organizan en torno a la c&aacute;tedra
Jean Monnet, ligada al Centro y en cuyo seno personalidades eminentes, tanto del
medio universitario como ajenas a &eacute;l, imparten cursos de varios meses de
duraci&oacute;n o conferencias sobre los &uacute;ltimos acontecimientos de la
integraci&oacute;n europea. 
</P>
<H2>El Foro Europeo
</H2>
<P>
El Foro tiene por objeto reunir en el Instituto, y a lo largo del mismo a&ntilde;o
acad&eacute;mico, especialistas de alto nivel en un tema com&uacute;n,
privilegiando los aspectos internacionales, comparativos e interdiciplinarios.
El tema para 1996/1997 (bajo la direcci&oacute;n acad&eacute;mica de los
profesores Leboutte y Joppke) es &#171;Las Migraciones&#187;,. El Foro organiza
tambi&eacute;n seminarios para los investigadores del Instituto.
</P>
<H2>Becas posdoctorales Jean Monnet
</H2>
<P>
El Instituto otorga cada a&ntilde;o unas veinte becas a j&oacute;venes doctores
o a universitarios en su a&ntilde;o sab&aacute;tico que se encuentren trabajando
dentro de las &aacute;reas mencionadas en el presente folleto. La informaci&oacute;n
necesaria puede obtenerse solicit&aacute;ndola al Sr. D. Delaunay.

<H2>Ce qu'est l'Institut universitaire europ&eacute;en
</H2>

</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
L'Institut universitaire europ&eacute;en, fond&eacute; en 1976 par les pays
membres des Communaut&eacute;s europ&eacute;ennes, vise &agrave; donner une
formation scientifique et culturelle europ&eacute;enne et conduit des recherches
dans une perspective europ&eacute;enne (recherche de base, recherche compar&eacute;e
et recherche communautaire) en sciences humaines et sociales: histoire, droit, &eacute;conomie,
sciences politiques et sociales. Son corps enseignant permanent et ses quelque
330 &eacute;tudiants-chercheurs proviennent de l'ensemble des pays de l'Union
europ&eacute;enne. Il est pr&eacute;sid&eacute; par le Dr&amp;nbsp; Patrick
Masterson, ancien pr&eacute;sident du University College de Dublin. Il
accueille, pour des p&eacute;riodes allant de un &agrave; trois ans, des &eacute;tudiants-chercheurs
d&eacute;sirant: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>pr&eacute;parer le doctorat de l'Institut<B> </B>(dur&eacute;e normale:
trois ans);
</LI>
<LI>passer le dipl&ocirc;me d'&eacute;tudes juridiques comparatives, europ&eacute;ennes
et internationales (DEJ), d'un niveau comparable au LL M britannique;
</LI>
<LI>ou, dans des cas exceptionnels, compl&eacute;ter, par un s&eacute;jour de
un ou deux ans &agrave; l'Institut, leur formation doctorale avant de soutenir
leur th&egrave;se dans leur universit&eacute; d'origine. 
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
En <B>France, </B>par arr&ecirc;t&eacute; du 20 octobre 1992 du ministre de l'&Eacute;ducation
nationale, le doctorat de l'Institut a &eacute;t&eacute; reconnu comme conf&eacute;rant
les m&ecirc;mes droits et pr&eacute;rogatives que le doctorat institu&eacute;
par la loi sur l'enseignement sup&eacute;rieur no 84-52, du 26 janvier 1984.
Cette pleine &eacute;quivalence concerne notamment les candidatures &agrave;
l'inscription sur la liste de qualification aux fonctions de ma&icirc;tre de
conf&eacute;rence r&eacute;cemment cr&eacute;&eacute;e par le d&eacute;cret du
16&amp;nbsp;janvier 1992.
</P>
<P>
En <B>Belgique,</B> la reconnaissance du doctorat de l'Institut est de la comp&eacute;tence
d'une Commission royale interuniversitaire pour les grades l&eacute;gaux (droit,
histoire). Pour les grades scientifiques, c'est &agrave; chaque universit&eacute;
qu'appartient la d&eacute;cision. 
</P>
<H2>Conditions de candidature et bourses d'&eacute;tudes
</H2>
<P>
Seuls peuvent &ecirc;tre admis &agrave; l'Institut les candidats titulaires d'un
dipl&ocirc;me de fin de second cycle avec mention (par exemple, ma&icirc;trise
fran&ccedil;aise avec mention ou de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rence DEA, licence belge
obtenue avec distinction). Il n'est pas requis d'&ecirc;tre en possession de ce
dipl&ocirc;me lors du d&eacute;p&ocirc;t de la candidature <I>(date limite: 31
janvier 1997)</I>, mais l'admission d&eacute;finitive &agrave; l'Institut (1er&amp;nbsp;
septembre 1997) est conditionn&eacute;e par son obtention avant cette derni&egrave;re
date. Les r&eacute;sultats de la proc&eacute;dure d'admission sont communiqu&eacute;s
aux candidats au d&eacute;but du mois d'avril.
</P>
<P>
Les chercheurs des pays de l'Union europ&eacute;enne admis &agrave; l'Institut b&eacute;n&eacute;ficient
d'une bourse de leur gouvernement pour la premi&egrave;re ann&eacute;e (et pour
le DEJ) et pour la deuxi&egrave;me ann&eacute;e ainsi que d'une bourse de
l'Institut pour la troisi&egrave;me ann&eacute;e. Les montants mensuels des
bourses nationales&amp;nbsp;sont, notamment, de 2&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000
lires italiennes pour la France et de 35&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;francs belges
pour la Belgique pour l'ann&eacute;e universitaire 1996/1997 plus les
allocations familiales). La Norv&egrave;ge et la Suiss<B>e</B> accordent &eacute;galement
une bourse &agrave; leurs ressortissants.  
</P>
<H2>Histoire et civilisation
</H2>
<P>
L'homog&eacute;n&eacute;it&eacute; de ce d&eacute;partement consiste dans
l'importance majeure qui est donn&eacute;e &agrave; l'histoire des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s
en Europe, dans une perspective comparative. Les travaux portent principalement
sur les p&eacute;riodes moderne et contemporaine. Cinq grands th&egrave;mes sont
privil&eacute;gi&eacute;s. 
</P>
<P>
<EM>Histoire de l'expansion europ&eacute;enne (XVIe-XVIIe si&egrave;cle</EM>
</P>
<P>
l'occasion de l'entr&eacute;e du Portugal &agrave; l'Institut et avec le soutien
du Comit&eacute; national portugais pour la comm&eacute;moration des grandes d&eacute;couvertes,
ce th&egrave;me porte plus particuli&egrave;rement sur les aspects &eacute;conomiques
et culturels de l'histoire de l'expansion europ&eacute;enne et de ses cons&eacute;quences.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Population, famille et soci&eacute;t&eacute; (XVIe-XXe si&egrave;cle)</EM>
</P>
<P>
Ce th&egrave;me, largement interdisciplinaire (histoire sociale, d&eacute;mographie
historique, anthropologie sociale), comprend une dimension m&eacute;thodologique
importante, avec le d&eacute;veloppement et l'exploration de m&eacute;thodes
d'analyse sur ordinateur ainsi que la construction de bases de donn&eacute;es
informatiques. Il traite aussi des relations entre sexe et travail depuis le
XVIe si&egrave;cle et des relations entre industrialisation et comportement d&eacute;mographique.

</P>
<P>
<EM>D&eacute;veloppement des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s industrielles et des r&eacute;gimes
politiques modernes (XVIIIe-XXe si&egrave;cle)</EM>
</P>
<P>
Ce domaine de recherche et de formation consid&egrave;re les points de d&eacute;part,
les causes, la nature et les rythmes du d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique,
l'impact de ces changements &eacute;conomiques sur la vie quotidienne des hommes
et des femmes qui les ont v&eacute;cus ainsi que les formes politiques que leurs
r&eacute;actions ont alors souvent prises.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Histoire culturelle de l'Europe du XVIe au XXe si&egrave;cle</EM>
</P>
<P>
Ce th&egrave;me d'&eacute;tudes correspond &agrave; deux choix sp&eacute;cifiques:
comprendre, &agrave; travers les pratiques, les habitudes et les objets, la
diversit&eacute; culturelle de l'Europe, sans privil&eacute;gier
l'intellectualit&eacute; et l'esth&eacute;tique et en mettant l'accent sur les
repr&eacute;sentations, leur circulation et leurs &eacute;changes (histoire des
mentalit&eacute;s); conserver une coh&eacute;rence avec les autres domaines de
la recherche, par l'attention donn&eacute;e aux aspects sociaux de l'histoire
culturelle.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Histoire de l'int&eacute;gration europ&eacute;enne</EM>
</P>
<P>
L'histoire de l'int&eacute;gration europ&eacute;enne est un projet de recherche
permanent de l'Institut. L'orientation de l'enseignement et de la recherche &eacute;volue
de fa&ccedil;on &agrave; tirer le meilleur parti de la r&egrave;gle des trente
ans qui r&eacute;git l'acc&egrave;s aux archives publiques. Les archives
communautaires sont d&eacute;pos&eacute;es aux Archives europ&eacute;ennes &agrave;
Florence, g&eacute;r&eacute;es par l'Institut, et fournissent une mati&egrave;re
suppl&eacute;mentaire pour le projet de recherche.  
</P>
<H2>Sciences &eacute;conomiques
</H2>
<P>
Ce d&eacute;partement vise &agrave; donner &agrave; ses chercheurs une formation
pouss&eacute;e dans les disciplines de l'&eacute;conomie et de l'&eacute;conom&eacute;trie
qui sont essentielles pour les &eacute;conomistes de profession. De plus, il m&egrave;ne
ses travaux dans les domaines ci-apr&egrave;s. 
</P>
<P>
<EM>Th&eacute;orie et analyse micro&eacute;conomiques</EM>
</P>
<P>
La th&eacute;orie micro&eacute;conomique est particuli&egrave;rement bien repr&eacute;sent&eacute;e
au sein du d&eacute;partement: th&eacute;orie de l'&eacute;quilibre g&eacute;n&eacute;ral
et ses d&eacute;veloppements, th&eacute;orie de l'oligopole et la concurrence
imparfaite, th&eacute;orie de la d&eacute;cision (choix rationnels, choix
collectifs), th&eacute;orie des expectations rationnelles, th&eacute;orie des
jeux, &eacute;conomie du bien-&ecirc;tre et &eacute;conomie financi&egrave;re.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Macro&eacute;conomie et politique &eacute;conomique</EM>
</P>
<P>
Ce th&egrave;me couvre essentiellement la mod&eacute;lisation macro&eacute;conomique
en &eacute;conomie ouverte, l'harmonisation progressive des politiques &eacute;conomiques,
mon&eacute;taires et financi&egrave;res des &Eacute;tats membres de la CE et l'&eacute;volution
du syst&egrave;me mon&eacute;taire europ&eacute;en. Sont &eacute;galement
couverts des domaines comme l'application de la th&eacute;orie des jeux diff&eacute;rentiels
&agrave; la macro&eacute;conomie, et notamment &agrave; la coordination
internationale des politiques &eacute;conomiques, ou les d&eacute;veloppements
de la th&eacute;orie des expectations rationnelles.
</P>
<P>
<EM>&Eacute;conom&eacute;trie</EM>
</P>
<P>
Les travaux portent, notamment, sur l'analyse des s&eacute;ries temporelles, sur
la co&iuml;nt&eacute;gration et les mod&egrave;les de correction d'erreurs, sur
les mod&egrave;les LDV, sur les ph&eacute;nom&amp;egrave;nes non lin&eacute;aires
et sur l'application de la g&eacute;om&eacute;trie diff&eacute;rentielle &agrave;
l'&eacute;conom&eacute;trie.
</P>
<P>
<EM>&Eacute;conomie industrielle</EM>
</P>
<P>
Ce domaine couvre l'impact de la diff&eacute;renciation des produits sur les r&eacute;sultats
commerciaux, les facteurs de la puissance des entreprises sur leur march&eacute;,
les applications de la th&eacute;orie des jeux, l'&eacute;conomie de
l'information incompl&egrave;te et les politiques d'aides industrielles au
niveau europ&eacute;en.

<EM>&Eacute;conomie internationale</EM>
</P>
<P>
Les travaux portent sur l'&eacute;volution r&eacute;cente de la division
internationale du travail et des avantages comparatifs, sur les th&eacute;ories
du taux de change, sur le r&ocirc;le des pouvoirs publics dans la comp&eacute;titivit&eacute;
ext&eacute;rieure et sur l'int&eacute;gration &eacute;conomique et mon&eacute;taire
europ&eacute;enne.

<P>
Ce th&egrave;me couvre des travaux sur l'offre de travail et son &eacute;volution
future, sur les relations entre prestations sociales et emploi ainsi que sur les
liaisons entre productivit&eacute; du travail et cycle &eacute;conomique. Il b&eacute;n&eacute;ficie
des synergies possibles avec les &eacute;tudes men&eacute;es dans le d&eacute;partement
des sciences politiques et sociales.

<H2>Sciences juridiques
</H2>
<P>
Trois &eacute;l&eacute;ments : caract&egrave;re europ&eacute;en, optique
comparative et m&eacute;thode contextuelle, caract&eacute;risent les travaux du
d&eacute;partement des sciences juridiques et fondent les trois grands th&egrave;mes
qui y sont d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s. 
</P>
<P>
<EM>Droit europ&eacute;en</EM>
</P>
<P>
Plusieurs travaux placent les questions de droit communautaire au coeur m&ecirc;me
de la recherche. Pour d'autres, la Communaut&eacute; europ&eacute;enne est le
cadre dans lequel sont examin&eacute;es les chances et les limites d'une int&eacute;gration
juridique europ&eacute;enne. Le d&eacute;partement accorde aussi un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
marqu&eacute; aux questions de la protection des droits fondamentaux par la
convention europ&eacute;enne des droits de l'homme.
</P>
<P>
Les chercheurs travaillant sur ce th&egrave;me b&eacute;n&eacute;ficient des
relations &eacute;troites que l'Institut entretient avec les diverses
institutions europ&eacute;ennes (Parlement, Commission, Cour de justice), au
sein desquelles certains ont la possibilit&eacute; d'effectuer un stage durant
le cours de leurs recherches.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Droit international et droit compar&eacute;</EM>
</P>
<P>
La finalit&eacute; des recherches du d&eacute;partement est souvent de comparer
sous tel ou tel aspect les diff&eacute;rents syst&egrave;mes juridiques. Les
disciplines du droit compar&eacute; et du droit international qui y sont le
mieux repr&eacute;sent&eacute;es sont:
</P>
<P>
- les relations entre les diff&eacute;rents niveaux d'ordres juridiques;  - les
droits de l'homme et le droit au d&eacute;veloppement; 
<BR> - le droit du travail compar&eacute; et les relations industrielles;
<BR> - le droit de l'environnement; <BR> - le droit commercial compar&eacute;;
<BR> - le droit constitutionnel compar&eacute;. 
</P>
<P>
<EM>Th&eacute;orie du droit et approches pluridisciplinaires</EM>
</P>
<P>
L'oppos&eacute; d'un type purement technique et doctrinal d'analyse juridique,
ces m&eacute;thodes mettent l'accent sur l'analyse du ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne
juridique dans son contexte social, politique et &eacute;conomique. Dans
l'enseignement comme dans la recherche, les disciplines telles que la th&eacute;orie
du droit, l'analyse &eacute;conomique du droit ou la sociologie juridique
tiennent donc une place importante. Parmi les approches interdisciplinaires, il
convient de mentionner particuli&egrave;rement le domaine des women's studies,
dans lequel l'Institut a une tradition interd&eacute;partementale bien &eacute;tablie.
Des recherches portent aussi sur la philosophie du droit et la pens&eacute;e
juridique contemporaine. 
</P>
<H2>Dipl&ocirc;me d'une ann&eacute;e en droit
</H2>
<P>
Outre le programme doctoral, le d&eacute;partement de droit propose un cycle
d'une ann&eacute;e menant au dipl&ocirc;me d'&eacute;tudes juridiques
comparatives, europ&eacute;ennes et internationales (DEJ), dipl&ocirc;me de
recherche dont les conditions d'admission sont les m&ecirc;mes que pour le
doctorat. Une s&eacute;rie de s&eacute;minaires de base est organis&eacute;e
pour tous les nouveaux chercheurs, qui peuvent &ecirc;tre exceptionnellement
autoris&eacute;s &agrave; passer d'un programme &agrave; l'autre en cours d'ann&eacute;e.

<H2>Che cosa &egrave; l'Istituto universitario europeo
</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
L'Istituto universitario europeo, fondato nel 1976 dai paesi membri delle
Comunit&agrave; europee, mira a fornire una formazione scientifica e culturale
europea e conduce ricerche in una prospettiva europea (ricerche di base,
ricerche comparate e ricerche comunitarie) nel campo delle scienze umane e
sociali: storia, diritto, economia, scienze politiche e sociali. Il suo corpo
insegnante permanente e i suoi circa 330 studenti-ricercatori provengono
dall'insieme dei paesi dell'Unione europea. presieduto dal dr. Patrick
Masterson, ex presidente dell'University College di Dublino. Accoglie, per
periodi da uno a tre anni, studenti-ricercatori che si prefiggono di: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>preparare il dottorato dell'Istituto (durata normale tre anni);
</LI>
<LI>ottenere il diploma di studi giuridici comparati, europei e internazionali
(DSG) o il diploma di studi economici (DSE), di un livello comparabile a un DEA
francese; 
</LI>
<LI>completare, in casi eccezionali, con un soggiorno di uno o due anni
all'Istituto, la loro formazione dottorale prima di sostenere la loro tesi
nell'universit&agrave; di appartenenza. 
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
L'insegnamento &egrave; principalmente in inglese (con alcuni seminari in
francese) e esistono eccellenti opportunit&agrave; per migliorare le proprie
capacit&agrave; linguistiche. L'IUE ha buoni legami con la Commissione a
Bruxelles (per esempio per periodi di tirocinio, accesso a dati, ecc.). 
</P>
<P>
Secondo le disposizioni previste dalla legge n. 352 dell'11 luglio 1986, i
titoli di dottore rilasciati dall'Istituto sono equipollenti a tutti gli effetti
nell'ordinamento giuridico italiano al titolo di dottore di ricerca rilasciato
dall'universit&agrave; italiana in base al decreto del presidente della
Repubblica 11 luglio 1980, n. 382. 
</P>
<H2>Condizioni di ammissione e borse di studio
</H2>
<P>
Possono essere ammessi all'Istituto soltanto i candidati titolari di un diploma
di laurea con lode (per esempio, ma&icirc;trise francese con lode o di
preferenza DEA, licenza belga ottenuta con lode). Non &egrave; richiesto di
essere in possesso di questo diploma al momento della presentazione della
candidatura (scadenza: 31 gennaio 1997), ma l'ammissione definitiva all'Istituto
(1 settembre 1997) &egrave; condizionata al suo ottenimento prima di
quest'ultima data. I risultati della procedura d'ammissione sono comunicati ai
candidati nel mese di maggio. 
</P>
<P>
I ricercatori dei paesi dell'Unione europea ammessi all'Istituto beneficiano di
una borsa del loro governo per il primo e per il secondo anno e di una borsa
dell'Istituto per il terzo anno. Gli importi mensili di queste borse sono
rispettivamente di 1 450 000 e 1 680 000 lire italiane per l'anno universitario
1996/97 (piu assegni familiari). 
</P>
<P>
La Norvegia e la Svizzera accordano ugualmente delle borse ai loro ricercatori
ammessi all'Istituto. 
</P>
<H2>Storia e civilt&agrave;
</H2>
<P>
L'omogeneit&agrave; del dipartimento si riassume nella priorit&agrave; accordata
alla storia delle societ&agrave; in Europa in una prospettiva comparativa. I
lavori vertono principalmente sui periodi moderno e contemporaneo. Cinque grandi
temi sono privilegiati.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Storia dell'espansione europea (XV-XVIII secolo)</EM> 
</P>
<P>
In occasione dell'entrata del Portogallo all'Istituto e con il sostegno del
Comitato nazionale portoghese per la commemorazione delle grandi scoperte,
questo nuovo argomento &egrave; stato introdotto a partire dal 1991/92 e
sviluppa in particolar modo gli aspetti economici e culturali della storia
dell'espansione europea e delle sue conseguenze.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Popolazione, famiglia e societ&agrave; (XVI-XX secolo)</EM>
</P>
<P>
Questo tema, fortemente interdisciplinare (storia sociale, demografia storica,
antropologia sociale), utilizza un approccio metodologico importante, basato
sullo sviluppo e l'esplorazione di metodi di analisi su computer e sulla
costruzione di data-base informatici, grazie allo spoglio di archivi
demografici, giudiziari o notarili. Esso tratta anche delle relazioni tra sesso
e lavoro dopo il XVI secolo e delle relazioni tra l'industrializzazione e il
comportamento demografico.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Storia culturale dell'Europa dal XVI al XX secolo</EM> 
</P>
<P>
Questa materia di studi corrisponde a due scelte specifiche: comprendere tramite
le abitudini, le pratiche e gli oggetti la diversit&agrave; culturale europea,
senza privilegiare l'intellettualismo e l'estetica e sottolineando le
rappresentazioni, la loro circolazione e i loro scambi (storia delle mentalit&agrave;),
e conservare una coerenza rispetto agli altri campi della ricerca,
concentrandosi sugli aspetti sociali della storia culturale.
</P>
<P>
<EM>L'emergere della societ&agrave; industriale nell'Europa occidentale (XVI-XX
secolo)</EM> 
</P>
<P>
Questo campo di ricerca e di formazione considera i punti di partenza, le cause,
la natura e i ritmi dello sviluppo economico, l'impatto che tali cambiamenti
economici hanno prodotto sulla vita quotidiana degli uomini e delle donne che li
hanno vissuti e le forme politiche che le loro reazioni hanno spesso assunto.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Storia dell'integrazione europea</EM> 
</P>
<P>
La storia dell'integrazione europea rappresenta un progetto di ricerca
permanente dell'Istituto. L'orientamento dell'insegnamento e della ricerca si
evolve in modo da sfruttare al meglio la , che determina l'accesso agli archivi
pubblici. Gli archivi comunitari sono ubicati presso gli archivi europei a
Firenze, gestiti dall'Istituto, e forniscono materiale supplementare per il
progetto di ricerca.  
</P>
<H2>Scienze economiche
</H2>
<P>
Il dipartimento mira a dare ai suoi ricercatori una formazione approfondita nei
campi dell'economia e dell'econometria, esseziale agli economisti di
professione. Inoltre, esso svolge le sue attivit&agrave; nei seguenti campi:
</P>
<P>
<EM>Teoria e analisi microeconomiche</EM> 
</P>
<P>
La teoria microeconomica &egrave; ben rappresentata in seno al dipartimento:
teoria dell'equilibrio economico generale e i suoi sviluppi; teoria
dell'oligopolio e l'economia della concorrenza imperfetta; teoria della
decisione (scelte razionali, scelte collettive); teoria delle aspettative
razionali; teoria dei giochi; economia del benessere ed economia finanziaria..
</P>
<P>
<EM>Macroeconomia e politica economica</EM> 
</P>
<P>
I temi di ricerca in questo campo comprendono la modellizzazione macroeconomica
in economia aperta, l'armonizzazione progressiva delle politiche economiche,
monetarie e finanziarie degli Stati membri della CEE e l'evoluzione del Sistema
monetario europeo. La ricerca riguarda anche campi quali l'applicazione della
teoria dei giochi differenziali applicata alla macroeconomia e al coordinamento
internazionale delle politiche economiche o gli sviluppi della teoria delle
aspettative razionali.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Econometria</EM> 
</P>
<P>
Le ricerche del dipartimento in questo settore sono: 1) l'applicazione dei
metodi delle serie temporali ai dati economici, l'analisi della stagionalit&agrave;,
tendenze e cicli; 2) lo sviluppo di nuove procedure econometriche
particolarmente nelle aree della cointegrazione e dei modelli di correzione
dell'errore; 3) le applicazioni delle tecniche microeconomiche per dati forniti
da gruppi di indagine e i modelli di variabile dipendente limitata. Interessi di
ricerca aggiuntivi includono la metodologia della modellizzazione econometrica,
l'applicazione della geometria differenziale all'econometria e le implicazioni
econometriche dei fenomeni di non linearit&agrave;.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Economia industriale</EM> 
</P>
<P>
Il campo di ricerca include l'impatto della differenziazione dei prodotti sui
risultati commerciali, i fattori di potere delle imprese sul loro mercato, le
applicazioni della teoria dei giochi, l'economia dell'informazione incompleta e
le politiche di aiuti industriali a livello europeo.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Economia internazionale</EM> 
</P>
<P>
Gli interessi di ricerca includono: l'unione economica e monetaria nella Comunit&agrave;
europea, la teoria dei tassi di cambio, la stabilizzazione attraverso zone
obiettivo e il Sistema monetario europeo, la trasmissione internazionale dei
cicli commerciali e la cooperazione internazionale delle politiche economiche.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Economia del lavoro</EM> 
</P>
<P>
Vengono considerati sia gli aspetti macroeconomici che quelli microeconomici
dell'economia del lavoro. Attenzione particolare &egrave; dedicata: alla
modellizzazione della durata della disoccupazione nei paesi dell'Europa
occidentale e orientale; all'analisi delle misure di previdenza e assicurazione
sociale; ai legami tra la produttivit&agrave; del lavoro e il ciclo economico;
alla disuguaglianza tra guadagni e redditi nell'Europa orientale. 
</P>
<H2>Scienze giuridiche
</H2>
<P>
Tre elementi, il carattere europeo, l'orientamento comparativo e il metodo
contestuale, caratterizzano gli studi del dipartimento di scienze giuridiche e
costituiscono i tre grandi temi che vi sono sviluppati.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Diritto europeo</EM> 
</P>
<P>
Diversi studi pongono le questioni di diritto comunitario al cuore stesso della
ricerca. Per altri, la Comunit&agrave; europea &egrave; il quadro nel quale sono
esaminate le possibilit&agrave; e i limiti di un'integrazione giuridica europea.
Il dipartimento presta un particolare interesse alle questioni della protezione
dei diritti fondamentali da parte della Commissione europea dei diritti
dell'uomo.
</P>
<P>
I ricercatori che lavorano su questo tema si avvalgono degli eccellenti rapporti
che l'Istituto intrattiene con le varie istituzioni europee rappresentate in
seno al consiglio di ricerca dell'Istituto stesso (Parlamento, Commissione,
Corte europea di giustizia), presso le quali alcuni ricercatori hanno la
possibilit&agrave; di effettuare un tirocinio durante la preparazione delle loro
ricerche.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Diritto internazionale e diritto comparato</EM> 
</P>
<P>
La finalit&agrave; delle ricerche del dipartimento &egrave; spesso quella di
comparare sotto vari aspetti i differenti sistemi giuridici. Le discipline di
diritto comparato e di diritto internazionale che vi sono meglio rappresentate
sono essenzialmente:
</P>
<P>
- le relazioni tra i vari livelli di ordini giuridici; <BR> - i diritti
dell'uomo e il diritto allo sviluppo; <BR> - il diritto del lavoro comparato e
le relazioni industriali;
<BR> - il diritto dell'ambiente; <BR> - il diritto commerciale comparato;
<BR> - il diritto costituzionale comparato.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Teoria del diritto e orientamenti interdisciplinari</EM> 
</P>
<P>
Al contrario di un genere puramente tecnico e dottrinale d'analisi giuridica,
questi metodi pongono l'accento sull'analisi del fenomeno giuridico nel suo
contesto sociale, politico e economico. Nell'insegnamento, come nella ricerca,
le discipline quali la teoria del diritto, l'analisi economica del diritto o la
sociologia giuridica ricoprono dunque una posizione importante. Tra gli
orientamenti interdisciplinari menzione speciale dovrebbe essere fatta dell'area
degli studi sulle donne, nella quale l'Istituto ha una tradizione
interdisciplinare ben consolidata. La ricerca corrente include la filosofia
legale e il pensiero legale contemporaneo. 
</P>
<H2>Diplomi di un anno in diritto
</H2>
<P>
Oltre al programma dottorale, il dipartimento di diritto propone un ciclo di un
anno volto all'ottenimento del diploma di studi giuridici comparativi, europei e
internazionali (DSG), diploma di ricerca le cui condizioni d'ammissione sono le
stesse che per il dottorato. Una serie di seminari &egrave; organizzata per
tutti i nuovi ricercatori (che possono essere eccezionalmente autorizzati a
passare da un programma all'altro nel corso dell'anno). 
</P>
<H2>Scienze politiche e sociali
</H2>
<P>
Il dipartimento ricerca un equilibrio tra gli orientamenti teorici e pratici,
tra la ricerca di base e un'ottica pi&ugrave; pragmatica verso i problemi di
definizione delle politiche nell'ambito nazionale o europeo.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Istituzioni politiche comparate e politica pubblica</EM> 
</P>
<P>
Il dipartimento ha una lunga tradizione di ricerca in questo campo coprendo
argomenti quali partiti politici, comportamento elettorale, processi di
decisione in seno ai governi, teorie della scelta pubblica e analisi delle
politiche regionali, sociali e dell'ambiente. In questa area, particolare enfasi
&egrave; posta sugli orientamenti teorici e metodologici.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Analisi delle politiche pubbliche</EM> 
</P>
<P>
Questo campo riguarda lo studio teorico del processo di formazione delle
politiche pubbliche, cosi come l'analisi di specifici settori quali quelli delle
politiche regionali, sociali, dell'ambiente, dei trasporti e delle
infrastrutture, a livello nazionale, europeo e internazionale. Un accento
particolare &egrave; posto sugli approci neoistitutionali.
</P>
<P>
<EM>L'integrazione europea e il suo contesto internazionale</EM>
</P>
<P>
Gli argomenti trattati nel campo delle politiche dell'integrazione europea
includono: la struttura istituzionale dell'Unione europea; le relazioni esterne
dell'Unione e la cooperazione politica europea; l'interazione tra politiche
dell'UE e quelle degli Stati membri ai livelli nazionale e subnazionale; il
ruolo dei partiti politici, i gruppi di interesse e le amministrazioni nella
formulazione e esecuzione delle politiche europee. Nel campo delle relazioni
internazionali, il lavoro del dipartimento ha una tradizione particolare nella
politica economica internazionale che include anche una forte componente
teorica.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Dinamiche sociali e politiche comparate delle societ&agrave; moderne</EM> 
</P>
<P>
Il lavoro in questa area si concentra sullo studio delle dinamiche sociali e
politiche delle societ&agrave; moderne. Esso include studi sulla mobilitazione
collettiva in campi quali: la protesta ambientale; il nazionalismo e il
regionalismo; la formazione degli argomenti e la strutturazione del discorso
pubblico; i processi di transizione nelle nazioni-Stato occidentali e
nell'Europa orientale postcomunista e le loro relazioni reciproche.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Istituzioni sociali comparate e disuguaglianza sociale</EM>
</P>
<P>
All'interno di questa area la ricerca si concentra sull'analisi delle relazioni
tra i diversi aspetti della disuguaglianza sociale e della politica sociale, con
particolare attenzione allo stato del benessere. Essa include lo studio della
mobilit&agrave; sociale, la sociologia dell'educazione, il comportamento del
mercato del lavoro e gli aspetti della stratificazione sociale legati al genere
di appartenenza.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Teoria sociale e politica</EM> 
</P>
<P>
Nel dipartimento vengono perseguiti diversi indirizzi di ricerca teorica:
l'analisi critica delle idee liberali e socialiste alla luce degli sviluppi
nella filosofia morale e politica contemporanea; la teoria democratica con
particolare riferimento alle tendenze recenti nelle teorie della
rappresentazione politica; le teorie della scelta razionale, i loro limiti e le
loro alternative; il contrattualismo classico e recente; le teorie del potere e
della soggettivit&agrave;; gli argomenti nella storia del pensiero politico, in
particolar modo relativi alla nascita dello Stato moderno.  
</P>
<H2>Il Centro Robert Schuman
</H2>
<P>
Il Centro Robert Schuman diretto dal prof. M&eacute;ny, cominci&ograve; le sue
attivit&agrave; ufficiali nel 1993. Esso e un centro di ricerca rivolto alle
grandi questioni con le quali deve confrontarsi la societ&agrave; europea
contemporanea, in particolar modo alla costruzione europea. Grazie a cattedre
comuni con un dipartimento, il Centro svolge lavori di ricerca sulle politiche
economiche in Europa, sulle relazioni internazionali (particolarmente sulle
questioni di sicurezza), sull'Europa centrale e orientale e sulla storia delle
relazioni tra i poteri pubblici e la societ&agrave; dopo il1945. Nell'ambito
della &#171;cattedra Jean Monnet&#187; che gli &egrave; collegata, alcune
personalit&agrave; eminenti sia del mondo universitario, che del mondo esterno
ad esso, potranno tenere un corso di diversi mesi o presentare delle conferenze
sugli ultimi sviluppi dell'integrazione europea.   
</P>
<H2>Il Forum europeo
</H2>
<P>
Esso ha per obiettivo quello di riunire all'Istituto per uno stesso dato anno
accademico specialisti di alto livello su uno stesso tema che privilegi gli
aspetti internazionali, comparativi e interdisciplinari. Il tema scelto per il
1997/98 (sotto la direzione accademica dei professori Leboutte e Joppke) &egrave;
su &#171;Le Migrazioni&#187;. Il Forum organizza inoltre seminari per i
ricercatori dell'Istituto.  
</P>
<H2>Borse di postdottorato Jean Monnet
</H2>
<P>
L'Istituto attribuisce ogni anno una ventina di borse a dei giovani dottori o
universitari in anno sabbatico, che lavorano in una delle discipline menzionate
nel presente pieghevole. La richiesta di informazioni pertinenti pu&ograve;
essere indirizzata all'Istituto, all'attenzione del sig. Dominique Delaunay.

<H2>O que &eacute; o Instituto Universit&aacute;rio Europeu </H2>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
O Instituto Universit&aacute;rio Europeu, fundado em 1976 pelos Estados-Membros
das Comunidades Europeias, tem como objectivo principal proporcionar uma forma&ccedil;&atilde;o
cient&iacute;fica e cultural e promover a investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o numa
perspectiva europeia (investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o b&aacute;sica, comparada e
comunit&aacute;ria) em ci&ecirc;ncias humanas e sociais: Hist&oacute;ria,
Direito, Economia e Ci&ecirc;ncias Pol&iacute;ticas e Sociais. O seu corpo
docente e os seus 330 investigadores prov&ecirc;m do conjunto dos pa&iacute;ses
da Uni&atilde;o Europeia. O Instituto &eacute; presidido pelo Professor
Masterson, Ex-Presidente do University College, Dublim. O Instituto acolhe, por
per&iacute;odos de um a tr&ecirc;s anos, investigadores que desejem:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>preparar uma tese para o <B>doutoramento do Instituto</B> (dura&ccedil;&atilde;o
normal: tr&ecirc;s anos);
</LI>
<LI>obter o Mestrado (LL.M) em Direito Comparado Europeu e Internacional (dura&ccedil;&atilde;o:
um ano);
</LI>
<LI>em casos muito excepcionais completar, com uma estada de um ou dois anos no
Instituto, a sua forma&ccedil;&atilde;o doutoral antes de apresentar e defender
a sua tese na universidade de origem. 
</LI>
</UL>
<H2>Condi&ccedil;&otilde;es para a apresenta&ccedil;&atilde;o de candidaturas e
obten&ccedil;&atilde;o de bolsas
</H2>
<P>
A habilita&ccedil;&atilde;o m&iacute;nima para admiss&atilde;o ao Instituto &eacute;
a licenciatura, mas os candidatos a doutoramento dever&atilde;o normalmente ser
possuidores de um mestrado (ou ter experi&ecirc;ncia de investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o
compar&aacute;vel). N&atilde;o &eacute; necess&aacute;rio possuir o diploma no
momento da apresenta&ccedil;&atilde;o da candidatura (data limite 31 de Janeiro
de 1997) mas apenas no momento da admiss&atilde;o definitiva ao Instituto (1 de
Setembro de 1997). Os resultados do concurso de admiss&atilde;o ser&atilde;o
comunicados aos candidatos durante o m&ecirc;s de Abril.
</P>
<P>
Os investigadores admitidos no Instituto ser&atilde;o bolseiros do Governo
portugu&ecirc;s durante o ano de estudos para o Mestrado ou durante os primeiros
dois anos do programa de doutoramento. Durante o terceiro ano as bolsas s&atilde;o
pagas pelo Instituto. No ano lectivo 1996/1997 o montante mensal das bolsas ser&aacute;,
respectivamente, de cerca 185 000 escudos ou de 1&amp;nbsp;680&amp;nbsp;000
liras italianas (mais o eventual abono de fam&iacute;lia).
</P>
<P>
Tamb&eacute;m os outros pa&iacute;ses da Uni&atilde;o Europeia e ainda a Noruega
e a Su&iacute;&ccedil;a concedem bolsas de estudo aos seus investigadores
admitidos no Instituto. 
</P>
<H2>Hist&oacute;ria e Civiliza&ccedil;&atilde;o
</H2>
<P>
A identidade do departamento adv&eacute;m da import&acirc;ncia atribu&iacute;da &agrave;
hist&oacute;ria das sociedades na Europa, numa perspectiva comparada. Trata-se
mais da hist&oacute;ria da evolu&ccedil;&atilde;o complexa das sociedades nas
suas dimens&otilde;es pol&iacute;ticas, econ&oacute;micas, sociais e culturais,
que de uma hist&oacute;ria sociol&oacute;gica. Ao estudo da variedade de rela&ccedil;&otilde;es
e de comportamentos vem juntar-se a an&aacute;lise dos grupos sociais. Os
trabalhos focam principalmente as &eacute;pocas moderna e contempor&acirc;nea,
sendo dada prefer&ecirc;ncia a cinco grandes temas:
</P>
<P>
<EM>Hist&oacute;ria da Expans&atilde;o Europeia (s&eacute;culos XV a XVIII)</EM>
</P>
<P>
Este tema de investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o foi lan&ccedil;ado em 1991/1992, por
ocasi&atilde;o da entrada de Portugal para o Instituto e conta com o apoio da
Comiss&atilde;o Nacional para a Comemora&ccedil;&amp;atilde;o dos Descobrimentos
Portugueses. Foca, em especial, os aspectos sociais, econ&oacute;micos e
culturais da hist&oacute;ria da expans&atilde;o europeia e as suas consequ&ecirc;ncias.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Popula&ccedil;&atilde;o, Fam&iacute;lia e Sociedade (s&eacute;culos XVI a
XX)</EM>
</P>
<P>
Trata-se de um campo interdisciplinar (hist&oacute;ria social, demografia hist&oacute;rica,
antropologia social), que abrange tamb&eacute;m uma dimens&atilde;o metodol&oacute;gica
importante com o desenvolvimento e explora&ccedil;&atilde;o de m&eacute;todos de
an&aacute;lise por computador ou a constru&ccedil;&atilde;o de bases de dados
informatizadas provenientes da pesquisa em arquivos demogr&aacute;ficos,
judiciais ou notariais. Trata igualmente das rela&ccedil;&otilde;es entre sexo e
trabalho, a partir do s&eacute;culo XVI, e das rela&ccedil;&otilde;es entre
industrializa&ccedil;&amp;atilde;o e comportamento demogr&aacute;fico.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Hist&oacute;ria Cultural da Europa (s&eacute;culos XVI a XX)</EM>
</P>
<P>
Este tema de estudos corresponde a duas op&ccedil;&otilde;es espec&iacute;ficas:

<BR> - procurar compreender, atrav&eacute;s das pr&aacute;ticas, dos costumes e
dos objectos, a diversidade cultural da Europa, sem privilegiar a
intelectualidade ou a est&eacute;tica, insistindo sobre as representa&ccedil;&otilde;es,
a sua circula&ccedil;&atilde;o e as suas trocas (hist&oacute;ria das
mentalidades); <BR> - o desejo de preservar uma coer&ecirc;ncia com os outros
dom&iacute;nios de investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o por meio da aten&ccedil;&atilde;o
prestada aos aspectos sociais da hist&oacute;ria cultural.<BR>
</P>
<P>
<EM>A Forma&ccedil;&atilde;o da Sociedade Industrial na Europa Ocidental (s&eacute;culos
XVI a XX)</EM>
</P>
<P>
Este dom&iacute;nio de investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o considera as origens, as
causas, a natureza e os ritmos do desenvolvimento econ&oacute;mico, o impacto
das mudan&ccedil;as econ&oacute;micas na vida quotidiana dos homens e mulheres
que as viveram e as formas pol&iacute;ticas que a reac&ccedil;&atilde;o destes
sujeitos possa ter tomado.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Hist&oacute;ria da Integra&ccedil;&atilde;o Europeia</EM>
</P>
<P>
A hist&oacute;ria da<B> </B>integra&ccedil;&atilde;o europeia &eacute; um dos
temas de investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o do departamento a que corresponde um
projecto de investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o permanente. A orienta&ccedil;&atilde;o do
ensino e da investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o evolui de forma a tirar o melhor partido
poss&iacute;vel da que regula o acesso aos arquivos p&uacute;blicos. Os arquivos
comunit&aacute;rios que se encontram depositados no Arquivo Europeu de Floren&ccedil;a,
s&atilde;o geridos pelo Instituto, e fornecem material suplementar para
projectos de investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o neste dom&iacute;nio.. 
</P>
<H2>Economia
</H2>
<P>
O departamento tem por objectivo proporcionar aos investigadores uma forma&ccedil;&atilde;o
profunda nas disciplinas de economia e econometria, essenciais aos economistas.
Para al&eacute;m disso conduz as suas actividades nos seguintes dom&iacute;nios:
</P>
<P>
<EM>Teoria e An&aacute;lise Microecon&oacute;micas</EM>
</P>
<P>
A teoria microecon&oacute;mica encontra-se muito bem representada no
departamento: teoria do equil&iacute;brio geral e os seus desenvolvimentos, 
rendimentos crescentes, teoria do oligop&oacute;lio, concorr&ecirc;ncia
imperfeita; teoria da decis&atilde;o (op&ccedil;&otilde;es racionais, op&ccedil;&otilde;es
colectivas); teoria das espectativas racionais; teoria de jogos e economia do
bem-estar e economia financeira. 
</P>
<P>
<EM>Macroeconomia e Pol&iacute;tica Econ&oacute;mica</EM>
</P>
<P>
Este tema cobre essencialmente o modelo macroecon&oacute;mico numa economia
aberta e a harmoniza&ccedil;&atilde;o progressiva das pol&iacute;ticas econ&oacute;micas,
monet&aacute;rias e financeiras dos Estados-Membros da Uni&atilde;o Europeia,
assim como a evolu&ccedil;&amp;atilde;o do Sistema Monet&aacute;rio Europeu. S&atilde;o
tamb&eacute;m abrangidos temas como a aplica&ccedil;&atilde;o da teoria dos
jogos diferenciados &agrave; macroeconomia, e nomeadamente &agrave; coordena&ccedil;&atilde;o
internacional das pol&iacute;ticas econ&oacute;micas, ou ainda a aplica&ccedil;&atilde;o
da teoria das expectativas racionais.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Econometria</EM>
</P>
<P>
Os trabalhos nesta, &aacute;rea referem-se particularmente &agrave; an&aacute;lise
das s&eacute;ries temporais, com aplica&ccedil;&atilde;o deste m&eacute;todo &agrave;
an&aacute;lise de ciclos econ&oacute;micos ou fen&oacute;menos de sazonalidade;
o desenvolvimento de novos m&eacute;todos econom&eacute;tricos, designadamente
em &aacute;reas de co-integra&ccedil;&atilde;o e modelos de correc&ccedil;&atilde;o
de erro; a aplica&ccedil;&atilde;o de m&eacute;todos de macroeconometria a
informa&ccedil;&atilde;o estat&iacute;stica e modelos de vari&aacute;veis
dependentes. Outras &aacute;reas de interesse compreendem os m&eacute;todos de
modeliza&ccedil;&atilde;o econom&eacute;trica, a aplica&ccedil;&atilde;o da
geometria diferencial &agrave; econometria e a an&aacute;lise econom&eacute;trica
dos fen&oacute;menos n&atilde;o lineares. 
</P>
<P>
<EM>Economia Industrial</EM>
</P>
<P>
O tema abrange o impacto da diferencia&ccedil;&atilde;o dos produtos sobre os
resultados comerciais, os factores de expans&atilde;o das empresas nos seus
mercados, as aplica&ccedil;&otilde;es da teoria dos jogos, a economia da informa&ccedil;&atilde;o
incompleta e as pol&iacute;ticas de ajuda industrial a n&iacute;vel europeu. 
</P>
<P>
<EM>Economia Internacional</EM>
</P>
<P>
Os trabalhos focam, entre outros assuntos, a Uni&atilde;o Econ&oacute;mica e
Monet&aacute;ria na Uni&atilde;o Europeia, os sistemas de taxas c&acirc;mbios e
a estabiliza&ccedil;&atilde;o de &#171; zonas-alvo&#187; e do Sistema Monet&aacute;rio
Europeu, a transmiss&atilde;o internacional dos ciclos econ&oacute;micos e a
coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o internacional no dom&iacute;nio da pol&iacute;tica econ&oacute;mica.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Economia do Trabalho</EM>
</P>
<P>
Este tema cobre actualmente aspectos macroecon&oacute;micos e microecon&oacute;micos
da economia do trabalho, com especial &ecirc;nfase para a modeliza&ccedil;&atilde;o
dos problemas do desemprego e sua persist&ecirc;ncia na Europa Ocidental e na
Europa do Leste; as liga&ccedil;&otilde;es entre produtividade do trabalho e
ciclo econ&oacute;mico; e para as desigualdades de rendimentos na Europa do
Leste.
</P>
<H2>Direito
</H2>
<P>
Tr&ecirc;s elementos caracterizam os trabalhos do Departamento de <EM>Direito
car&aacute;cter europeu, &oacute;ptica comparativa e m&eacute;todo contextual</EM>
e s&atilde;o a base dos tr&ecirc;s grandes temas de desenvolvimento.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Direito Europeu</EM>
</P>
<P>
O direito comunit&aacute;rio constitui o n&uacute;cleo central de numerosos
projectos de investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o. Para outros a Uni&atilde;o Europeia e
as suas institui&ccedil;&otilde;es constitui o quadro de refer&ecirc;ncia onde
se examinam as possibilidades e os limites de uma integra&ccedil;&atilde;o jur&iacute;dica
europeia. Outro aspecto importante neste tema &eacute; a protec&ccedil;&atilde;o
dos direitos fundamentais na Conven&ccedil;&atilde;o Europeia dos Direitos do
Homem.
</P>
<P>
Os investigadores que trabalham neste dom&iacute;nio beneficiam das rela&ccedil;&otilde;es
estreitas que o Instituto mant&eacute;m com as diferentes institui&ccedil;&otilde;es
europeias representadas no Conselho de Investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o do Instituto
(Parlamento, Conselho, Comiss&atilde;o, Tribunal Europeu de Justi&ccedil;a), no
seio das quais &eacute; poss&iacute;vel efectuar um est&aacute;gio durante o per&iacute;odo
da investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Direito Internacional e Direito Comparado</EM>
</P>
<P>
Frequentemente, o objecto dos estudos efectuados no departamento &eacute; a an&aacute;lise
comparativa de uma quest&atilde;o ou instituti&ccedil;&atilde;o em diferentes
sistemas jur&iacute;dicos. As &aacute;reas de Direito Comparado e de Direito
Internacional melhor representadas s&atilde;o:
</P>
<P>
- as rela&ccedil;&otilde;es entre os diferentes n&iacute;veis de sistemas jur&iacute;dicos;
<BR> - os direitos do homem e o direito ao desenvolvimento; <BR> - a igualdade
e a diferencia&ccedil;&atilde;o jur&iacute;dica entre homens e mulheres; <BR> -
o direito comparado do trabalho e rela&ccedil;&otilde;es industriais;
<BR> - o direito do meio-ambiente; <BR> - o direito comercial comparado; <BR>
- o direito constitucional comparado. <BR>
</P>
<P>
<EM>Teoria do Direito e abordagens interdisciplinares </EM>
</P>
<P>
A identidade do departamento caracteriza-se pelo seu m&eacute;todo contextual
que privilegia uma an&aacute;lise do fen&oacute;meno jur&iacute;dico no seu
contexto social, pol&iacute;tico e econ&oacute;mico, em detrimento de uma an&aacute;lise
jur&iacute;dica puramente t&eacute;cnica e doutrinal. Tanto no ensino como na
investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o, disciplinas como Teoria do Direito, An&aacute;lise
Econ&oacute;mica do Direito ou Sociologia Jur&iacute;dica t&ecirc;m um lugar
importante. Registe-se que, de entre os m&uacute;ltiplos aspectos
interdisciplinares que caracterizam o departamento, a aplica&ccedil;&atilde;o
das teorias feministas ao direito assume um particular relevo. A investiga&amp;ccedil;&atilde;o
conduz tamb&eacute;m &agrave; filosofia do direito e do pensamento jur&iacute;dico
contempor&acirc;neo. 
</P>
<H2>Curso de um ano em direito </H2>
<P>
Para al&eacute;m do programa de doutoramento, o Departamento de
<I>Direit </I>prop&otilde;e um ciclo de um ano para obten&ccedil;&atilde;o do
Mestrado (LL.M) em Direito Comparado, Europeu e Internacional, cujas condi&ccedil;&otilde;es
de admiss&atilde;o s&atilde;o as mesmas que as exigidas para o doutoramento. Uma
s&eacute;rie de semin&aacute;rios &eacute; organizada para todos os novos
investigadores (que podem pedir para passar de um a outro programa durante o ano
lectivo). 
</P>
<H2>Ci&ecirc;ncias Pol&iacute;ticas e Sociais </H2>
<P>
O departamento procura um equil&iacute;brio entre as abordagens te&oacute;ricas
e pr&aacute;ticas, entre a pesquisa de base e uma orienta&ccedil;&atilde;o mais
pragm&aacute;tica para os problemas de defini&ccedil;&atilde;o das pol&iacute;ticas
seja num enquadramento nacional seja num enquadramento europeu.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Institui&ccedil;&otilde;es e Comportamentos Pol&iacute;ticos Comparados</EM>
</P>
<P>
O departamento tem uma longa tradi&ccedil;&atilde;o de investiga&ccedil;&amp;atilde;o
neste tema que cobre os estudos sobre partidos, os comportamentos eleitorais, os
processos de decis&atilde;o no seio dos governos, a teoria da escolha p&uacute;blica
e a an&aacute;lise das pol&iacute;ticas regionais, sociais e do ambiente. &Eacute;
dada particular aten&ccedil;&amp;atilde;o aos aspectos te&oacute;ricos e metodol&oacute;gicos
que se levantam nesta &aacute;rea.
</P>
<P>
<EM>An&aacute;lise das Pol&iacute;ticas P&uacute;blicas</EM>
</P>
<P>
O dom&iacute;nio cobre os estudos te&oacute;ricos sobre os mecanismos de tomada
de decis&atilde;o, bem como os estudos pr&aacute;ticos sobre sectores
particulares como a pol&iacute;tica regional, a pol&iacute;tica social, a pol&iacute;tica
dos transportes ou do ambiente. Um acento particular &eacute; dado a uma
abordagem neo-institucionalista. 
</P>
<P>
<EM>A Integra&ccedil;&atilde;o Europeia e o seu Contexto Internacional</EM>
</P>
<P>
Neste tema analizam-se os aspectos pol&iacute;ticos da integra&ccedil;&amp;atilde;o
Europeia que incluem, entre outros, as institui&ccedil;&otilde;es da Uni&atilde;o
Europeia; as rela&ccedil;&otilde;es externas da Uni&atilde;o e a Coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o
Pol&iacute;tica Europeia; a interac&ccedil;&atilde;o entre as v&aacute;rias pol&iacute;ticas
da UE e os Estados-Membros a n&iacute;vel nacional e infranacional; o papel dos
partidos pol&iacute;ticos, grupos de interesse e administra&amp;ccedil;&otilde;
s na formula&ccedil;&atilde;o das pol&iacute;ticas europeias. O departamento tem
igualmente concedido particular relevo aos aspectos te&oacute;ricos da economia
pol&iacute;tica internacional no campo das rela&ccedil;&otilde;es
internacionais. 
</P>
<P>
<EM>Din&acirc;mica Social e Pol&iacute;tica nas Sociedades Modernas</EM>
</P>
<P>
Este tema aborda sob uma perspectiva comparativa aspectos da din&acirc;mica
social e pol&iacute;tica nas sociedades modernas, com relevo para o estudo dos
movimentos de protesto no campo ambiental; o nacionalismo e o regionalismo; o
debate p&uacute;blico e a formula&ccedil;&atilde;o da agenda pol&iacute;tica; os
processos de transforma&ccedil;&atilde;o societal na Europa Ocidental e transi&ccedil;&atilde;o
na Europa p&oacute;s-comunista e a sua rela&ccedil;&atilde;o destes com as
teorias da democracia.

<H3><A NAME="Admission_to_I">1. Admission to the Institute</A>
</H3> 
<H4>1.1. <A NAME="Admission_of_two">Admission is foreseen for two types of
doctoral research student</A>: </H4> 
<UL>
<LI>1. research students wishing to spend three years at the Institute and
defend a thesis with a view to taking the Institute's doctorate;
</LI>
<LI>2. exceptionally, research students registered for a doctorate in their own
country, who wish to supplement their training by a stay of one or two years at
the Institute and who will defend their thesis for the award of the doctorate of
their university of origin. (Such students may be admitted directly to the
second year if they have already acquired sufficient qualifications.)
</LI> 
</UL>
<P>
At the same level of admission, the Institute also admits
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/LAW/Welcome.html">Law</A> graduates wishing to take
the one-year LL M course. (Additionally, in the
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/ECO/Welcome.html">Economics</A> Department, it is
possible to be awarded an M. Econ. after the first year examinations of the
doctoral course.)
</P>
<P>
In the academic year 1996/97, Institute research students number 342:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>- in the first year (including the LL.M) 114
</LI>
<LI>- in the second year 107
</LI>
<LI>- in the third year 121
</LI> 
</OL>
<P>
The Institute has a policy of cooperation with European universities doing
research in the same fields. This cooperation is pursued through networks of
universities in the European Union's Erasmus/Socrates and Tempus/Phare
programmes. There are also specific cooperation agreements with certain
universities, which may include clauses on joint training of doctoral students.
</P>
<H4>1.2. <A NAME="Admission_conditions">Admission conditions</A>
</H4> 
<UL>
<LI>The Institute mainly admits students who are nationals of the European
Union Member States, with which there is an agreement for the
<A HREF="grants.htm">award of grants</A> to their nationals admitted to the
Institute.
</LI>
<LI>Under association agreements with Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and
Switzerland, it also admits a number of students from these countries, who
similarly receive <A HREF="grants.htm#Other">national grants</A>.
</LI>
<LI>Finally, under the European Commission's <A HREF="grants.htm#Eastern">Tempus/Phare</A>
programme, in cooperation with the Central European University (Budapest) and
with support from private donors (particularly the bank &quot;Cassa di Risparmio
di Firenze&quot;), it takes a number of students from Central and East European
countries. It may also take nationals of other countries under special
agreements.
</LI> 
</UL>
<P>
As a rule, the minimum qualifications required are as follows:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>for students from French universities: a &quot;ma&icirc;trise&quot;<I>
</I>or equivalent degree, with distinction; preference to &quot;DEA&quot;
holders;
</LI>
<LI>for students from Belgian universities: a &quot;ma&icirc;trise&quot;<I>
</I>(economics), or &quot;licence&quot;<I> </I>with distinction;
</LI>
<LI>for students from Danish universities: a &quot;kandidateksamen&quot;;
</LI>
<LI>for students from German universities: completion of university studies and
possession of the qualifications required for proceeding to a doctorate;
economists need to be &quot;Diplom-Volkswirte&quot;;
</LI>
<LI>for students from Greek universities: first degree (&quot;ptychio&quot;);
</LI>
<LI>for students from Spanish universities: first degree;
</LI>
<LI>for students from Italian universities: a &quot;laurea&quot; with
distinction, plus, if possible, a post-graduate diploma;
</LI>
<LI>for students from universities in the Netherlands: a<I> </I>&quot;doctoraal
examen&quot;;
</LI>
<LI>for students from Portuguese universities: first degree;
</LI>
<LI>for students from British or Irish universities: a good honours degree (at
least upper second); preference to those with a Master's degree;
</LI>
<LI>for students from universities in other countries: a diploma equivalent to
the above and the qualifications needed to proceed to a doctorate.
</LI> 
</OL>
<UL>
<LI>Any additional qualification, research experience or professional
experience would be an advantage.
</LI>
<LI>Candidates should have a reasonable working knowledge of at least two
official languages of the Institute (Danish, Dutch, English, French, German,
Greek, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish).
</LI>
<LI>At the interview, candidates will be asked to sit a language test in order
to evaluate their ability to participate in seminars and to write research
material. The choice of language used in the test will depend on the working
language of the target department (usually French or English). Candidates with
particular language requirements for their research may also be asked to sit a
test(s) in additional language(s). Language test results are an integral part of
the admission file.
</LI>
<LI>It should be noted that the majority of seminars at the Institute are given
in English or French. Good English is particularly useful in the departments of
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/ECO/Welcome.html">Economics</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/SPS/Dept/Welcome.html">Political and Social Sciences</A>.
The Institute provides intensive
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/LINGUE/Welcome.html">language</A> sessions in
September and continuous tuition until the end of March.
</LI>
<LI>Candidates (including LL.M) should propose a specific thesis project which
should be within the research area covered by the Institute. Historians should
note the special requirements and refer to the note in the
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/HEC/Welcome.html">History</A> pages. The Admissions
Committee will take particular account of the academic record, supervision
possibilities, language skills and relevance to Institute research projects.
</LI> 
</UL>
<H4>1.3. <A NAME="Admission_procedure">Admission procedure</A>
</H4> 
<P>
Interested candidates in possession of the required qualifications, or likely to
obtain them by the end of June 1997 (or at the latest by the start of the
academic year 1997/98), can either:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>ask the <A HREF="acserhp.htm">Academic Service</A> (e-mail:
<A HREF="mailto:applyres@datacomm.iue.it">applyres@datacomm.iue.it</A>) of the
European University Institute, or write to one of the authorities listed on the
<A HREF="authorit.htm">Grant-awarding Authorities</A> page, for a set of
application forms or
</LI>
<LI>print the <A HREF="applproc.htm">application form</A> material from the
Application Form page (while noting the specific printing procedure).
</LI> 
</OL>
<P>
Either way, the form should be filled in, IN TRIPLICATE, and returned to the
Institute's Academic Service by<STRONG> 31 January 1997</STRONG> (date of
postmark), by registered express post. It must NOT be returned by Email,
Internet or any electronic means.
</P>
<P>
It simultaneously constitutes an application for a national grant if the
applicant is from one of the Contracting States (except for <A HREF="#Spanish">Spain</A>,
see next paragraph).
</P>
<UL>
<LI>NOTE:
<MENU>
<LI>Danish applicants (more information can be found in Danish on the
<A HREF="authorit.htm">Grant-awarding Authorities</A> page) must send their
application to the Rektorkollegiet office in Copenhagen (see
<A HREF="grants.htm">Grants Authorities</A> addresses page).
</LI>
<LI>French and Spanish candidates should send one set of their application
documents to the national grant-awarding authority (see <A HREF="grants.htm">Grants
Authorities</A> addresses page).
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="Spanish">Additionally</A>, for the grant application, all Spanish
candidates, without exception, must fill in a special application form available
from their grant-awarding authority in Madrid (see <A HREF="grants.htm">Grants
Authorities</A> addresses page).
</LI> 
</MENU></LI> 
</UL>
<P>
Applicants are kindly requested to attach to their application a summary of
their research project in one of the most used teaching languages of the
Institute (Economics candidates please use English).
</P>
<P>
Applications are screened, on the basis of candidates' qualifications and the
number of grants available, by national preselection committees which are made
up of one Institute professor per department and a representative of the
grant-awarding body. Short-listed candidates are invited for interview with the
professors of the target department in late March. The final decision on
admissions will be taken in early April by the <A HREF="admictee.htm">Admissions
Committee</A> which is made up of the Principal, one professor of each
department and a student representative.
</P>
<P>
Admission is granted for either the doctoral or the LL.M programme. Advancement
to <A HREF="#Second_and_third">second and third year</A> follows the rules
described further down in this chapter.
</P>
<H4>1.4. <A NAME="Entrance_fees">Entrance fees</A> for non-EU research
students </H4> 
<UL>
<LI>No entrance fees are required from students admitted to the Institute who
are nationals of the European Union Member States and who receive grants from
their own national authorities. Since Austria, Sweden and Finland are expected
to accede to the EUI Convention in 1997 or 1998, similarly no entrance fees will
then be required for nationals of these three countries provided they are
admitted to the Institute with a grant from the national grant-awarding
authority.
</LI>
<LI>For Swiss, and Norwegian students admitted on a national grant, the
entrance fees are paid directly by their national grant-awarding authority.
</LI>
<LI>For other nationals, the entrance fees as of 1st January 1997 are Lit.
20,000,000 per year of study at the Institute, in accordance with High Council
Decision of 14 June 1996. However, the Principal is authorised to reduce or
waive entrance fees on behalf of nationals of developing countries or Central
and East European countries.

<H3>2. <A NAME="Organisation_of_Studies">Organisation of studies</A>
</H3> 
<H4>2.1. <A NAME="First_year">First year </A>of study and research
</H4> 
<P>
For those researchers who propose to undertake the doctorate of the Institute,
the first year of the doctoral course is designed as a period of preparation and
assessment.
</P>
<P>
Research students arrive in Florence at the end of August. The first month is
devoted to intensive <A HREF="http://www.iue.it/LINGUE/Welcome.html">language
courses</A>, particularly in Italian (to help fit into the host country) and in
English. This first month also includes
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/LIB/Welcome.html">library</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/Welcome.html">computer service</A> introduction
courses. This is the period when research students should seek initial contacts
with professors in their departments.
</P>
<P>
A thesis supervisor is assigned to each new research student shortly after
arrival at the Institute. In some cases, where a thesis subject has special
aspects justifying recourse to a particular specialist, a co-supervisor, who may
be from outside the Institute, may be appointed. (For the organisation of
studies in the <A HREF="http://www.iue.it/ECO/Welcome.html">Economics
Department</A>, refer to the separate page).
</P>
<P>
The rest of the first term is devoted to seminars introducing the research
themes in the department to which the researcher is attached, and providing
instruction on research concepts and methods in the discipline. In addition, the
researcher, in consultation with his/her supervisor, chooses his/her research
project and prepares a research plan. From January onwards, the research student
will regularly attend seminars at which the research themes of the department
(or of other departments) most relevant to his/her own research will be treated
in greater depth and detail. Research students have an opportunity to present
their research work at a tutorial seminar or workshop, some of which will be
given by visiting professors.
</P>
<H4>Assessment : </H4> 
<P>
An assessment of the researcher's capacity to proceed to the successful
completion of the doctorate takes place in June. It is based principally on the
quality of his/her research plan and of a substantial paper, presented at that
time, covering an area of his/her proposed research (and in the case of the
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/ECO/Welcome.html">Economics Department</A> on a
number of exams). This assessment is the basis for admission of the research
student to a second year at the Institute (decided by the
<A HREF="admictee.htm">Admissions Committee</A>), and implies an extension of
the grant.
</P>
<P>
The end-of-year paper (June paper) should as a rule include an indication of the
specific questions the student intends to deal with in the thesis. It is not
enough at this stage to indicate and describe a general field for analysis;
specific questions to be examined in the thesis should be formulated in detail,
with an indication of methods and sources to be used in so doing, and a critical
analysis of the relevant literature as well as a work plan and detailed
timetable for completing the thesis in the coming two years.
</P>
<H4>2.2. <A NAME="Second_and_third">Second and third</A> academic years </H4> 
<P>
The professor who has supervised the research student's work in the first year
normally continues as thesis supervisor when the research student is admitted to
the second year. In some cases, appointment of a co-supervisor is possible.
</P>
<P>
Students attend the seminars run by the department associated with their
research, and on the basis of the work plan drawn up at the end of the first
year, periodically submit progress in their work for assessment by the thesis
supervisor. Admission to the third year is decided by the
<A HREF="admictee.htm">Admissions Committee</A> on the basis of a favourable
recommendation from the department. The thesis draft (or at least a first
version) should normally be submitted to the supervisor by the research student
towards the end of the third year. </P>
<HR> 
<H3>3. <A NAME="Institute_doctorate">The Institute's Doctorate</A>
</H3> 
<H4>3.1 <A NAME="Thesis_defence">Thesis Defence</A> </H4> 
<P>
To defend a doctoral thesis, a research student must have spent at least two
years at the Institute and played an active part in the seminars relating to
his/her research work.
</P>
<P>
Theses are defended at the Institute before an international Examining Board
appointed by the Academic Council on the proposal of the department concerned.
Normally, the Examining Board will have four members, two of whom will be from
the academic staff of the EUI.
</P>
<P>
The doctorate is awarded in the following forms:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>1. Doctor of the European University Institute in History and Civilization;
</LI>
<LI>2. Doctor of the European University Institute in Law;
</LI>
<LI>3. Doctor of the European University Institute in Economics;
</LI>
<LI>4. Doctor of the European University Institute in Political and Social
Sciences.
</LI> 
</UL>
<P>
The Institute is endeavouring to develop cooperation agreements with a number of
universities. Some agreements provide for conferment of a doctorate by one of
the institutions, but with a certificate from the other indicating that some of
the doctoral studies were done there.
</P>
<H4>3.2. <A NAME="Recognition">Recognition </A>of the Doctorate
</H4> 
<P>
The Ministers of Education of the European Community, at their meeting of 3 June
1985, established that the Institute's doctorate should be recognised in Member
States in the same way as equivalent national titles. They therefore agreed to
take the necessary steps for this recognition in those countries where the
decision on equivalencies lies with the Minister for Education and, for the
other countries, to induce the competent authorities and institutions to
recognise equivalence.
</P>
<P>
The countries of Europe where the State plays no part in the recognition of
university diplomas (which depend entirely on the universities themselves) are
Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Other Member States have official regulations regarding recognition of the
doctorate or the right to use the title of doctor. These are Belgium, Germany,
Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. The position in the various countries
is as follows:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Belgium: Only the legal degrees (law, history) are covered by government
regulation. Recognition of an Institute doctorate taken in one of these areas
may be granted by a Royal Commission, which considers individually the
applications submitted to it by those concerned. The recognition of scientific
degrees (economics, political science) is instead a matter for the competent
authorities of each university. Use of the title of doctor is, by the Law of 11
September 1933, subject to prior authorisation from the Minister for National
Education.
</LI>
<LI>Denmark: No government regulation.
</LI>
<LI>Federal Republic of Germany: The Conference of Education Ministers (KMK)
established, by the Decision of 16 August 1978, that the Institute doctorate is
of equivalent level to a doctorate of a German university. Further to this, KMK
Decision of 4 September 1994 recognises the right to use the title of Doctor of
the EUI in the Federal Republic. Applications for recognition are to be
addressed to the Education Ministry of the &quot;Land&quot; of  residence.
</LI>
<LI>France: By the Decree of 20 October 1992 of the Minister of National
Education the Institute doctorate was recognised as conferring the same rights
and privileges as the doctorate introduced by the Higher Education Act No 84-52
of 26 January 1984. This full equivalence applies in particular to applications
for entry on the qualification list leading to the position of lecturer recently
established by the Decree of 16 January 1992.
</LI>
<LI>Greece: The Greek Centre for Recognition of Foreign University Degrees
(Di.K.A.T.S.A.) in 1995 recognised the EUI as equivalent to a Greek university.
The postgraduate titles awarded by the EUI are consequently equivalent to those
conferred by Greek universities.
</LI>
<LI>Ireland: No government regulation.
</LI>
<LI>Italy: Law No 352 of 11 July 1986 recognises the Institute's doctorate as
equivalent to the &quot;Dottorato di Ricerca&quot; established by Presidential
Decree no. 382 of 11 July 1980.
</LI>
<LI>Luxemburg: The title of Doctor of the EUI must be registered with the &quot;Commission
des Titres&quot; at the national Education Ministry.
</LI>
<LI>Netherlands: By the Decree of 15 May 1985 of the Minister for Education and
Science, the title of doctor may be used in the Netherlands by Dutch subjects
who have taken the Institute's doctorate.
</LI>
<LI>Portugal: &quot;Decreto-Lei No. 93/96&quot; of 15 July 1996 recognises the
Institute's doctorate as equivalent to the degree of doctor of a Portuguese
university. The title of Doctor of the EUI must be registered with the
Department of Higher Education of the national Ministry of Education.
</LI>
<LI>Spain: By Royal Decree No 823/1989 of 7 July 1989, the Institute doctorate
was officially recognised as equivalent to the doctorate conferred by a Spanish
university on the basis of Royal Decree No 185/1985 of 23 January 1985 (BOE No
164 of 11 July 1989)
</LI>
<LI>United Kingdom: No government regulation.

<H4>1. <A NAME="Permanent"></A>Permanent Accommodation</H4> 
<MENU>
<LI>The <A HREF="acserhp.htm">Academic Service</A> has a <A HREF="deeley.htm">reception
office</A> which deals with accommodation for research students. It manages the
Institute's own accommodation (which consists of 38 furnished flats in the
village of Pian di Mugnone, some 2 km from the Badia Fiesolana, housing up to 73
persons) and centralizes all other offers of lodging, which are usually houses,
flats and bedsitters (for the most part furnished) within a 10 to 12 km radius
of the Institute. The Institute gives advice and language assistance to
researchers to help them find accommodation.
</LI> 
</MENU>
<H4>2. <A NAME="Temporary"></A>Temporary Accommodation</H4> 
<MENU>
<LI>Each year, for the month of September, in order to give new arrivals the
time to find suitable lodgings, the Institute books a number of reasonably
priced rooms in a nearby villa (20 minutes' walk).
</LI> 
</MENU>
<H4>3. <A NAME="Life"></A>Life in Florence</H4> 
<MENU>
<LI>Famous for centuries as one of the main centres of art and learning in
Italy, Florence is now important not only for its collection of art, its
museums, and its architecture, but also as the commercial and administrative
capital of Tuscany. The city, with approximately 500,000 inhabitants, is
extremely active as regards music, theatre, cinema, sports and recreation: there
are, for example, two resident orchestras, and several music festivals are held
each year.
</LI>
<LI>The surrounding hills make ideal walking country, while the seaside is just
over an hours' drive away. In winter, there is skiing at Abetone, about 80 km
from Florence.
</LI>
<LI>The climate is very hot in summer(25-35 degrees C) and cold in winter (0-5
degrees C).
</LI>
<LI>A guide with all the practical information necessary for living in Florence
is supplied to new students upon arrival.
</LI> 
</MENU>
<H4>4. <A NAME="Cost"></A>Cost of Living in Florence </H4> 
<MENU>
<LI>Florence is generally considered one of the most expensive cities in Italy.
Its importance as a tourist centre and the shortage of accommodation for the
population have direct effects on rents, costs of hotels and restaurants, food
and clothing. Transport and service costs are comparable to those of other
cities.
</LI>
<LI>For instance, in spring 1996 a room in a flat shared by three people costs
about Lit. 550,000-600,000, plus Lit 100,000 for electricity, gas and heating.
</LI>
<LI>The minimum maintenance grant recommended for a single person in a
flat-sharing situation for 1996-97 is Lit. 1,600,000 per month.
</LI>
<LI>The basic <A HREF="grants.htm">grants</A> to research students cover only
the cost of maintaining one person. Students with family responsibilities must
be aware that in most cases the family allowances may prove insufficient and
that access to other sources of funds may prove necessary.
</LI> 
</MENU>
<H5>5. <A NAME="Cultural"></A>Cultural and social activities at the EUI </H5> 
<MENU>
<LI>A cultural and social committee made up of staff members and research
students regularly organizes cultural events (concerts, exhibitions, recitals,
poetry readings, film shows) and excursions. Those interested may also practise
a number of sports, including tennis, volleyball and swimming, or attend
gymnastic courses.
</LI> 
</MENU>
<H5>6. <A NAME="Creche"></A>Cr&egrave;che/daycare </H5> 
<MENU>
<LI>A cr&egrave;che-cum-daycare run by a parents' committee is open to children
of students and staff; it caters for smaller (nursery-age) children all day,
while older children (school age) may attend in the afternoon.
</LI> 
</MENU>
<H5>7. <A NAME="Canteen"></A>Canteen and Common Room </H5> 
<MENU>
<LI>A self-service canteen operates at the Institute at lunch-time. Students
benefit from a 30% reduction on prices. In the morning and early afternoon the
canteen runs a cafeteria service.
</LI>
<LI>A television and lounge area is available as well as the student-run 'Bar
Fiasco'.
</LI> 
</MENU>
<H5>8. <A NAME="Newspaper"></A>Newspaper Reading Room.</H5> 
<MENU>
<LI>Other facilities available to research students include a newspaper reading
room which has most of Europe's main daily newspapers.

<LI>Medical and accident insurance matters for research students and

</LI>
</UL>
<H4>2. <A NAME="Health"> Health Insurance</A></H4>
<MENU>
<LI>All research students and Jean Monnet Fellows admitted to the Institute
must have adequate medical insurance for the duration of their stay. This may be
by means of a private or state insurance cover which will be checked when the
student or Fellow registers at the beginning of the academic year.
</LI>
<LI>The Institute subscribes to a collective medical insurance policy taken out
with an international insurer. The policy is valid worldwide and may be extended
to cover a research student's or fellow's dependants.
</LI>
<LI>Belgian, British, German, Irish, Portuguese and Spanish research students
in receipt of grants from their government are, if they wish, insured against
sickness via the collective EUI policy. The British, Irish and Spanish
authorities also cover the research student's dependants. (LL.M students with a
scholarship from the UK authorities should note that they are obliged to extend
their national insurance rights abroad for the one year of study, using the E111
form and that they may not take advantage of the EUI collective scheme unless
they pay for the premium personally - more information on this will be
distributed to successful candidates before registration). 
</LI>
<LI>Other research students must insure themselves for their first two years at
the Institute. For this, they may join the above-mentioned Institute scheme at a
cost of Lit. 44,000 per month per adult and Lit. 22,500 per month per child.
</LI>
<LI>Jean Monnet Fellows and their dependants are covered by the EUI collective
scheme if they so wish;  the Institute then pays the premium.
</LI>
<LI>Subscription forms are sent to new students and Fellows along with
admission documents.
</LI>
</MENU>
<H4>3.  <A NAME="Accident">Accident</A> Insurance
</H4>
<MENU>
<LI>All research students and <A HREF="http://www.iue.it/JMF/Welcome.html">Jean
Monnet Fellows</A> are covered worldwide against the risks of accident by a
second collective policy the Institute has taken out, although it is to be
underlined that this is a complementary cover, coming into operation only after
the insured's principal health insurance cover (be it the scheme mentioned above
or any other public or private scheme) has reimbursed its part of the medical
expenses incurred.
</LI>
<LI>It must also be noted that research students' or Jean Monnet Fellows'
dependants are NOT eligible for this accident insurance cover. They are advised
to take out a suitable accident insurance cover in their country of residence
which will be valid for the entire duration of their stay in Italy.

<P>
Am Montag, dem 2. Dezember 1996, kommt der italienische Staatspr&auml;sident
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro nach Florenz, um dem Europ&auml;ischen Hochschulinstitut
einen Besuch abzustatten.
</P>
<P>
Am Vormittag wird er bei den Feierlichkeiten zum zwanzigj&auml;hrigen Bestehen
des Instituts in der Badia Fiesolana zugegen sein und am Nachmittag dem aus
diesem Anla&szlig; im Theater della Pergola veranstalteten Konzert beiwohnen.
</P>
<P>
Mit 450 Forschungsstudenten, 45 Lehrkr&auml;ften und 30
Jean-Monnet-Forschungsstipendiaten bietet das Institut das umfassendste
Ausbildungsprogramm f&uuml;r Doktoranden in Europa an und hat sich mit nahezu 70
Dissertationsverteidigungen im Jahre 1995 als Einrichtung best&auml;tigt, die
gegenw&auml;rtig die gr&ouml;&szlig;te Anzahl von Forschungsdoktoraten in Europa
in den Disziplinen verleiht, auf die sich die Forschungsarbeiten seiner vier
Abteilungen (Recht, Wirtschaft, Politik- und Sozialwissenschaften, Geschichte)
erstrecken.
</P>
<P>
Das Institut wird gegenw&auml;rtig von dem irischen Staatsangeh&ouml;rigen Dr.
Patrick Masterson geleitet. Seine Vorg&auml;nger im Amt des Pr&auml;sidenten
waren der Niederl&auml;nder Max Kohnstamm, ehemaliger Generalsekret&auml;r der
Hohen Beh&ouml;rde der EGKS, der Deutsche Werner Maihofer, Professor an der
Universit&auml;t Bielefeld und ehemaliger Bundesminister des Innern, und der
Franzose Emile No&euml;l, ehemaliger Generalsekret&auml;r der Europ&auml;ischen
Kommission.
</P>
<P>
Zu den Lehrkr&auml;ften des Instituts z&auml;hlten stets hochrangige
Wissenschaftler wie Sir Andrew Shonfield, Carlo Cipolla, Ren&eacute; David,
Antonio Cassese, Mauro Cappelletti, Carlo Poni und Joseph Weiler, und als
Gastprofessoren weilten hier u.a. die Nobelpreistr&auml;ger J.R. Hicks, R.
Selten, K. Arrow und F. Modigliani.
</P>
<P>

rational-&ouml;konomischen Denken unserer Zeit hat der Florentiner Geist einst T&uuml;ren
ge&ouml;ffnet.
</P>
<P>
Florentiner Denker erweiterten den europ&auml;ischen Horizont f&uuml;r die Welt,
die Europa umgibt.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Amerigo Vespucci wurde zum Herold der Neuen Welt, der er schlie&szlig;lich
seinen Namen gab.
</LI>
<LI>Leonardo da Vinci zeichnete die erste Weltkarte, die auch Amerika enthielt.
</LI>
<LI>Galileo Galilei pr&auml;zisierte das heliozentrische Weltbild.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Florenz ist zugleich einer der ma&szlig;geblichen Schaupl&auml;tze jener fr&uuml;hen
kommerziellen Revolution, als deren sp&auml;te Nachfahren die heutigen globalen
M&auml;rkte erscheinen.
</P>
<P>
So begannen im dreizehnten Jahrhundert die Florentiner Kaufleute damit, fern vom
heimischen Kontor ein enges Netz an Niederlassungen zu kn&uuml;pfen. Sie kauften
und verkauften ihre Waren nicht mehr auf Messen, sondern unmittelbar an den
Produktions- und Absatzorten.
</P>
<P>
Damit einher gingen zu jener Zeit zwei epochale Innovationen: die doppelte Buchf&uuml;hrung
und - als Finanzinstrument - der Wechsel.
</P>
<P>
Wobei sich schon damals der Doppelcharakter jeder Finanzinnovation zeigte:
</P>
<P>
Sie vereinfachte das Finanzieren von Produktion und Handel. Und zugleich
konstituierte sie einen Finanzmarkt, auf dem lukrative Arbitrage m&ouml;glich
war. Denn wer - wie die Florentiner Kaufleute durch ihre Faktoren - gut &uuml;ber
die Kurse der Wechsel an den einzelnen Handelspl&auml;tzen informiert war,
konnte erhebliche Gewinne erzielen.
</P>
<P>
Wirtschaftliche Integration ist keine Erfindung unserer Tage - weder innerhalb
Europas noch weltweit.
</P>
<P>
Der amerikanische &Ouml;konom Paul Krugman hat vorgeschlagen, wenn man unbedingt
den Startschu&szlig; f&uuml;r die moderne Globalisierung datieren m&ouml;chte,
das Jahr 1869 zu nehmen. Das Jahr, in dem sowohl der Suez-Kanal als auch die
Union Pacific Eisenbahn fertiggestellt wurden.
</P>
<P>
In der Tat erlebte die Welt zwischen Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts und dem Ersten
Weltkrieg eine Periode intensiver Integration. Das hohe Wachstum im Welthandel
nach 1950 l&auml;&szlig;t sich teilweise bis in die siebziger Jahre hinein als
das Restaurieren der vormals bestehenden Verflechtung interpretieren. 
</P>
<P>
So gesehen - ob Renaissance, ob zwanzigstes Jahrhundert - ist grenz&uuml;berschreitende
wirtschaftliche Integration &quot;ein alter Hut&quot;.
</P>
<CENTER><H2>II</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Was erlaubt dann, heute mit dem Begriff der Globalisierung anzudeuten, da&szlig;
eine neue Qualit&auml;t, eine neue Realit&auml;t erreicht oder doch im Entstehen
begriffen ist?
</P>
<P>
Die moderne Globalisierung zeichnet sich vor allem durch drei neuartige
strukturelle Merkmale aus:
</P>
<P>
Das erste Merkmal ist die deutliche Zunahme des intra-industriellen Handels.
</P>
<P>
Der traditionelle Au&szlig;enhandel einer Industrienation fr&uuml;herer Tage
vollzog sich im wesentlichen nach dem klassischen Muster: Industrielle
Fertigwaren gegen Rohstoffe.
</P>
<P>
Heute handeln die Industriel&auml;nder in hohem Ma&szlig;e untereinander mit
Produkten, die zwar hoch differenziert, aber im Grunde &auml;hnlich sind. Das
allseits beliebte Beispiel aus der Automobilbranche: Italiener fahren VW und
Porsche, Deutsche fahren Fiat und Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
Das zweite Merkmal ist die tiefe Verflechtung der Volkswirtschaften schon beim
Produzieren.
</P>
<P>
Unternehmen, ganze Industriezweige k&ouml;nnen heute weitgehend die Wertsch&ouml;pfungskette
r&auml;umlich aufspalten. Sie nutzen damit regionale Standortvorteile konsequent
aus.
</P>
<P>
Dieses Aufspalten gibt Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern die Chance, nicht mehr nur in
den klassischen Branchen mit hoher Arbeitsintensit&auml;t wie Textilien zu
konkurrieren. Sie sind teilweise auch integriert in das Herstellen von
Hochtechnologieprodukten wie etwa Computern.
</P>
<P>
Und damit ist bereits das dritte Merkmal angedeutet: Der rasante wirtschaftliche
Aufstieg einer Reihe von Schwellenl&auml;ndern.
</P>
<P>
Hinter diesen neuen Strukturen stecken zwei Gruppen von Faktoren.
</P>
<P>
Erstens politische Faktoren:
</P>
<P>
Der Handel mit G&uuml;tern, Dienstleistungen und Kapital wurde innerhalb
regionaler Zonen, aber auch weltweit zunehmend liberalisiert. Und vor allem
haben sich viele Entwicklungs- und Schwellenl&auml;nder in Asien und in
Lateinamerika sowie die Reformstaaten in Mittel- und Osteuropa intern
marktwirtschaftlichen Ordnungen zugewandt.
</P>
<P>
Viele asiatische L&auml;nder bilden hohe inl&auml;ndische Ersparnisse. Damit k&ouml;nnen
sie umfangreich investieren, um ihre Wirtschaft aufzubauen, und zugleich eine
hohe Exportquote aufrechterhalten.
</P>
<P>
Zum zweiten gr&uuml;ndet die Globalisierung rasant zunehmend auch auf
technologischen Faktoren:
</P>
<P>
Die Transport- und Kommunikationskosten sind gerade auch in den letzten Jahren
teilweise dramatisch gesunken. Unternehmen k&ouml;nnen dadurch r&auml;umlich
getrennte Produktionsvorg&auml;nge effizient koordinieren. Selbst Mitarbeiter in
verschiedenen Kontinenten k&ouml;nnen gleichzeitig an ein und demselben Projekt
arbeiten. Zugleich ist das technische Wissen verfeinert. 
</P>
<P>
Vor allem diffundieren das Wissen und das Know-how heute wesentlich schneller
und umfassender als je zuvor. Und dieser Proze&szlig; wird sich in Zukunft eher
noch beschleunigen.
</P>
<P>
Was folgt aus alledem?
</P>
<P>
In erster Linie ist weltweit der Standortwettbewerb deutlich sch&auml;rfer
geworden, und er wird wohl noch sch&auml;rfer werden. Nicht nur Unternehmen
konkurrieren miteinander, sondern Regionen. Das gesamte politische Umfeld, vor
allem das Steuer- und Sozialsystem spielt dabei als Standortfaktor eine immer
wichtigere Rolle.
</P>
<P>
Vorsprung ist tempor&auml;r. Regionen und Industrien m&uuml;ssen immer wieder
Vorteile neu erk&auml;mpfen. Letztlich z&auml;hlt die Flexibilit&auml;t, die F&auml;higkeit,
sich anzupassen und die immerw&auml;hrende Aufgabe des Strukturwandel zu bew&auml;ltigen.
</P>
<CENTER><H2>III</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Am radikalsten haben sich zweifellos die internationalen Finanzm&auml;rkte
gewandelt.
</P>
<P>
Die Finanzm&auml;rkte sch&ouml;pfen die technischen Fortschritte in der
Datenverarbeitung und in der Telekommunikation besonders aus. Sie k&ouml;nnen
heute riesige Betr&auml;ge in Sekundenbruchteilen rund um den Globus schicken.
</P>
<P>
Das technologische Potential hat neuen Strukturen binnen weniger Jahre zum
Durchbruch verholfen.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Neue komplexe Instrumente wie die Derivate revolutionieren den Handel mit
Risiken.
</LI>
<LI>Der professionelle Fondsmanager verdr&auml;ngt als Akteur an den Finanzm&auml;rkten
in erheblichem Ma&szlig;e den privaten Rentier.
</LI>
<LI>Damit kehrt ein neues Verhalten ein. Der Fondsmanager orientiert sich st&auml;rker
an der kurzfristigen Performance des Portfolios als an der l&auml;ngerfristigen.
</LI>
<LI>Die M&auml;rkte erfassen und verarbeiten heute einen praktisch unendlichen
Strom an Informationen.
</LI>
<LI>Damit steigt die Rolle der Erwartungen bei Anlageentscheidungen.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Die Finanzm&auml;rkte leiten die Kapitalstr&ouml;me schnell und effizient zu den
produktiven Verwendungen. Sie erh&ouml;hen damit das weltwirtschaftliche
Wachstumspotential.
</P>
<P>
Doch zugleich k&ouml;nnen die M&auml;rkte die Kapitalstr&ouml;me an einem
einzelnen Land auch weitgehend vorbeiflie&szlig;en lassen oder das Kapital von
dort abziehen.
</P>
<P>
Die Finanzm&auml;rkte beurteilen n&auml;mlich ein Land. Sie schauen dabei nicht
nur auf aktuelle Daten, sondern sie versuchen einzusch&auml;tzen, inwieweit ein
Land f&auml;hig und willens ist, seine l&auml;ngerfristigen Probleme anzugehen.
Die Erwartungen dar&uuml;ber z&auml;hlen.
</P>
<P>
Die M&auml;rkte beginnen einem Land zu mi&szlig;trauen, wenn sie Signale
empfangen, da&szlig; dort die l&auml;ngerfristigen Probleme liegenbleiben.
Indikatoren hierf&uuml;r k&ouml;nnen vor allem eine Geld- oder eine
Fiskalpolitik sein, die Zweifel aufkommen lassen an einem l&auml;ngerfristig
stabilit&auml;tsorientierten Kurs.
</P>
<P>
Auf diese Weise r&uuml;cken die Finanzm&auml;rkte in die Rolle der Kontrolleure.
Sie k&ouml;nnen eine laxe Geldpolitik und eine undisziplinierte Haushaltspolitik
schon im Ansatz bestrafen. Sie entziehen diesem Land Kapital und fordern einen
hohen Zuschlag bei den Kapitalmarktzinsen.
</P>
<P>
Gewi&szlig;, die Finanzm&auml;rkte k&ouml;nnen dabei auch zu Fehlurteilen
kommen, die dann zu &uuml;bertriebenen Reaktionen f&uuml;hren. Die &Uuml;bertreibungen
sind aber meist nur kurzfristig.
</P>
<P>
L&auml;ngerfristig sind dann doch die Fundamentaldaten entscheidend. Dabei ist
die Glaubw&uuml;rdigkeit meist besonders wichtig.
</P>
<CENTER><H2>IV</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Unter dem Strich bedeutet Globalisierung f&uuml;r die nationale Politik:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Die gesamte Wirtschaftsverfassung, also die Sozialsysteme, die
Regulierungen an G&uuml;ter- und Arbeitsm&auml;rkten, die Steuerpolitik, die
Rechtsordnung, all dies steht im Standortwettbewerb.
</LI>
<LI>Und die Geld- und Finanzpolitik steht im permanenten Test der
internationalen Finanzm&auml;rkte.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Globalisierung schr&auml;nkt damit die nationale Souver&auml;nit&auml;t der
Politik ein. Wie bei jedem Mehr an Wettbewerb m&uuml;ssen sich die Anbieter st&auml;rker
am Markt orientieren.
</P>
<P>
Aber unter den Regeln einer globalen Wirtschaft stehen im Grunde alle L&auml;nder.
Warum - und das ist der Kern der Problematik - warum scheint Europa damit
besonders schwer zurechtzukommen?
</P>
<P>
Dies hat wohl damit zu tun, da&szlig; die Folgen der Globalisierung just in
Europa auf ohnehin bestehende strukturelle Schw&auml;chen der Wirtschaft
treffen, diese akzentuieren und damit auch deren L&ouml;sung dringlicher machen.
</P>
<P>
Erstens: Der verst&auml;rkte weltweite Standortwettbewerb, der hohe Flexibilit&auml;t
und Bereitschaft zum Strukturwandel fordert, trifft in vielen L&auml;ndern
Europas auf einen rigiden Arbeitsmarkt und auf ein starres Sozialsystem.
</P>
<P>
Globalisierung prallt oft auf inflexible interne Strukturen. Das f&uuml;hrt zu
hoher Arbeitslosigkeit vor allem unter den Geringerqualifizierten.
</P>
<P>
In Amerika dagegen findet die Globalisierung einen traditionell wesentlich
flexibleren Arbeitsmarkt vor. Dies f&uuml;hrt dort zu einem hohen Zuwachs an
Besch&auml;ftigung, freilich auch um den Preis einer st&auml;rkeren
Differenzierung der Einkommen.
</P>
<P>
Und zweitens: Die sinkenden Spielr&auml;ume der Steuer- und der Finanzpolitik
treffen in Europa oft auf einen Staat, der weitgehend &uuml;berfrachtet wird mit
Anspr&uuml;chen und Aufgaben.
</P>
<P>
Dieses &Uuml;berfrachten zeigt sich in den hohen Staatsschulden, aber auch im
Rentensystem, das sich angesichts des demographischen Wandels schwertun wird,
die Versprechen an die J&uuml;ngeren einzul&ouml;sen.
</P>
<P>
Interne Fehler der Vergangenheit und Globalisierung greifen ineinander.
</P>
<P>
Auf der Ausgabenseite m&uuml;ssen die &ouml;ffentlichen Haushalte heute
erhebliche Mittel aufbringen, um den aufgelaufenen Schuldenberg zu bedienen.
</P>
<P>
Zugleich hinterfragen die Finanzm&auml;rkte jederzeit kritisch H&ouml;he und
Tragbarkeit der Defizite. Ein negatives Urteil lie&szlig;e die Zinslast weiter
anschwellen.
</P>
<P>
Auf der Einnahmenseite k&ouml;nnte eine Erosion der Steuerbasis drohen. Die
zunehmende Steuer- und Abgabenlast f&ouml;rdert intern tendenziell die
Schattenwirtschaft.
</P>
<P>
Zugleich sind die Unternehmen unter den heutigen technologischen und verkehrsm&auml;&szlig;igen
Bedingungen im Standortwettbewerb beweglicher geworden. Sie k&ouml;nnen leichter
Ertr&auml;ge verlagern und damit Steuern vermeiden. Und die globalen M&auml;rkte
k&ouml;nnen nationale Regulierungen durchaus legal ins Leere laufen lassen.
</P>
<P>
Die internen strukturellen Schw&auml;chen in Europa haben ihren Ursprung nicht
in der Globalisierung. Aber die Globalisierung dr&uuml;ckt auf die
Schwachstellen und legt sie offen.
</P>
<P>
Das bedeutet Verlust an Wettbewerbsf&auml;higkeit und an Attraktivit&auml;t f&uuml;r
neue Investitionen sowie Verlust an Besch&auml;ftigung.
</P>
<P>
Und das l&ouml;st Unbehagen aus.
</P>
<CENTER><H2>V</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Europa darf nicht versuchen, vor diesen Herausforderungen davonzulaufen. Der
versch&auml;rfte Wettbewerb ist Realit&auml;t.
</P>
<P>
Man mag hoffen, den einen oder anderen Parameter des Standortwettbewerbs - etwa
im Steuerbereich - innerhalb Europas zu harmonisieren. Man mag auch hoffen,
durch weltweite Kooperation einige der Spielregeln zu verbessern. 
</P>
<P>
Allerdings sollte niemand glauben, Europa k&ouml;nne der Welt &quot;seine&quot;
Spielregeln oder sein Sozialstaatsmodell oktroyieren.
</P>
<P>
Das zeigt allein schon die Diskussion in der WTO unter ihrem Generaldirektor
Renato Ruggiero, inwieweit die WTO-Regeln um Arbeits- und Sozialstandards zu
erweitern seien. Die erste WTO-Ministerkonferenz wird sich in zwei Wochen in
Singapur wohl auch mit diesem heiklen Thema befassen.
</P>
<P>
Zahlreiche WTO-Mitglieder widersetzen sich. Sie f&uuml;rchten, die Industriel&auml;nder
wollten mit Hilfe von Standards vor allem billige Importe behindern. In der Welt
von heute k&ouml;nnen sich die Industriel&auml;nder nicht einfach &uuml;ber die
politische Stimme der anderen hinwegsetzen.
</P>
<P>
Die Globalisierung ist irreversibel.
</P>
<P>
Weder kann Europa etwas daran &auml;ndern, da&szlig; andere L&auml;nder sich
verst&auml;rkt an der Marktwirtschaft orientieren und damit ihre Leistungsf&auml;higkeit
steigern.
</P>
<P>
Noch kann Europa die bestehende Verflechtung sowohl weltweit als auch innerhalb
des Binnenmarktes kappen, ohne die eigene Wirtschaft erheblich zu schw&auml;chen.
</P>
<P>
Noch kann Europa den technischen Fortschritt zur&uuml;ckdrehen. Im Gegenteil,
der l&auml;&szlig;t sich nicht aufhalten und wird sich eher noch beschleunigen.
</P>
<P>
Und schon gar nicht kann die Politik in Europa - wie neulich ein franz&ouml;sischer
Soziologe vorschlug - sich &uuml;ber die &ouml;konomischen Realit&auml;ten
erheben und quasi in einem konstitutionellen Akt einen europ&auml;ischen
Sozialstaat setzen.
</P>
<P>
Hochfliegender Konstruktivismus pflegt tief zu st&uuml;rzen. 
</P>
<P>
Der Ansatz &uuml;bersieht die &ouml;konomischen Bedingungen globaler M&auml;rkte
sowie die inneren Widerspr&uuml;che eines ausufernden Sozialstaates. Vor allem &uuml;bersieht
der Ansatz, mit welcher Wucht &ouml;konomische Realit&auml;ten politische
Fehlkonstruktionen zerschmettern k&ouml;nnen.
</P>
<P>
Das alles ist Realit&auml;t - ob uns das gef&auml;llt oder nicht.
</P>
<P>
Das ist wie in der bekannten Anekdote von den drei Florentiner Gesandten. Die
stellten sich einmal einem ausw&auml;rtigen Herzog vor mit der Anredeformel: &quot;Wir
sind B&uuml;rger und Gesandte von Florenz, wenn es Euch gef&auml;llt.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Hinterher &auml;rgerten sich die drei f&uuml;rchterlich &uuml;ber diese Floskel.
Und sie revidierten ihre Anrede mit dem Hinweis: &quot;M&ouml;ge es Euch
gefallen oder nicht, wir sind sowohl B&uuml;rger als auch Gesandte von Florenz.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Heute besuchen die Gesandten der Globalisierung die europ&auml;ische Wirtschaft;
aber sie f&uuml;gen bestimmt nicht hinzu: &quot;Wenn es Euch gef&auml;llt&quot;.
</P>
<CENTER><H2>VI</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Welche Rolle kann die W&auml;hrung beim Bew&auml;ltigen der enormen
Herausforderungen spielen? Nat&uuml;rlich kann die W&auml;hrung die
strukturellen Probleme selbst nicht l&ouml;sen, ob sie nun D-Mark, Franc, Lira
oder auch Euro hei&szlig;t.
</P>
<P>
Europa kommt nicht daran vorbei, den Sozialstaat zu reformieren, um ihn in der
Substanz zu erhalten. Dazu geh&ouml;rt mehr Selbstverantwortung, mehr
Eigeninitiative, mehr Subsidiarit&auml;t der B&uuml;rger.
</P>
<P>
Aber das kann die Politik legitimerweise nur einfordern, wenn stabiles Geld dem
B&uuml;rger auch die Chance gibt, selbst Vorsorge zu betreiben und vern&uuml;nftige,
in die Zukunft gerichtete Entscheidungen zu treffen.
</P>
<P>
Und stabiles Geld ist wichtig, um Arbeitspl&auml;tze zu schaffen.
</P>
<P>
Denn es hilft den Unternehmen, das zum Investieren notwendige Kapital g&uuml;nstig
zu bekommen. Die B&uuml;rger haben mehr Anreiz zu sparen. Das inl&auml;ndische
Kapitalangebot nimmt zu. Und die internationalen Finanzm&auml;rkte werten eine
stabile W&auml;hrung als Pluspunkt bei ihrer Anlageentscheidung. 
</P>
<P>
Deshalb gilt die grundlegende Aussage: Die Teilnehmer der W&auml;hrungsunion
werden nur die Chance haben, ihre Probleme zu l&ouml;sen, wenn der Euro
dauerhaft stabil wird.
</P>
<P>
Carlo Ciampi hat dies neulich so ausgedr&uuml;ckt:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Es ist das Interesse Europas, einen starken Euro zu haben. Wir k&ouml;nnen
uns nicht erlauben, die starke Deutsche Mark durch einen schwachen Euro zu
ersetzen. Das w&auml;re schlecht f&uuml;r ganz Europa.&quot;
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Ich kann dem nur zustimmen.
</P>
<CENTER><H2>VII</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Aber die in Europa angestrebte W&auml;hrungsunion befreit nicht von &ouml;konomischen
Zw&auml;ngen. Im Gegenteil, die W&auml;hrungsunion bedeutet ja - noch mehr als
die Globalisierung - ein Einschr&auml;nken von nationaler Souver&auml;nit&auml;t,
von nationalen Handlungsspielr&auml;umen und Alleing&auml;ngen.
</P>
<P>
Die Teilnehmerl&auml;nder verlieren untereinander das Instrument der
Wechselkursanpassung. Das verst&auml;rkt den Druck zu innerer Flexibilit&auml;t.
</P>
<P>
Aber eine gemeinsame W&auml;hrung verlangt noch mehr.
</P>
<P>
In einer W&auml;hrungsunion m&uuml;ssen die L&auml;nder ihre wirtschaftlichen
Probleme und Herausforderungen in &auml;hnlicher Weise und in &auml;hnlichem
Tempo angehen und l&ouml;sen. Geben die L&auml;nder n&auml;mlich fundamental
unterschiedliche Antworten, dann entstehen gro&szlig;e Probleme:
</P>
<P>
Erstens, soweit die L&auml;nder in der Grundlinie tats&auml;chlich
unterschiedlich reagieren, entsteht ein &ouml;konomisches Problem.
</P>
<P>
L&auml;nder, die richtige L&ouml;sungen energisch umsetzen, werden bald gegen&uuml;ber
den L&auml;ndern, die falsch oder z&ouml;gerlich reagieren, wettbewerbsf&auml;higer
werden. Aber es gibt keinen Wechselkurs mehr, um das einzufangen. Die
wirtschaftliche Entwicklung w&uuml;rde divergieren. Es k&auml;me zu internen
Spannungen.
</P>
<P>
Zweitens, soweit die L&auml;nder ihren Wunsch nach einer anderen Politik nicht
umsetzen k&ouml;nnen, weil sie das Eingebundensein in die W&auml;hrungsunion
daran hindert, entsteht ein politisches Problem. Es k&auml;me zu politischen
Spannungen. Europa k&ouml;nnte schnell zum S&uuml;ndenbock werden.
</P>
<P>
Und drittens, welche Spannungen auch immer aufk&auml;men, die internationalen
Finanzm&auml;rkte w&uuml;rden den Euro daf&uuml;r haftbar machen. 
</P>
<P>
Eine W&auml;hrungsunion braucht &auml;hnliche Antworten der beteiligten
Volkswirtschaften und Staaten auf die gro&szlig;en &ouml;konomischen Fragen der
Zeit.
</P>
<P>
Das ist keine akademische, abstrakte Forderung. Denn die wirtschaftlichen
Herausforderungen an die L&auml;nder ergeben sich nicht irgendwann in ferner
Zukunft. Sie stehen vor der T&uuml;r.
</P>
<P>
Wie kann Europa die notwendige Kongruenz erreichen?
</P>
<P>
Eine L&ouml;sung w&auml;re eine weitgehende, formal verfa&szlig;te Politische
Union, der Weg in eine gemeinsame Staatlichkeit.
</P>
<P>
Die L&auml;nder w&uuml;rden ihre Souver&auml;nit&auml;t immer weiter einschr&auml;nken.
Zwar w&uuml;rde die Vielfalt Europas auf jeden Fall einen f&ouml;deralen Aufbau
erfordern. Gleichwohl ginge die Kompetenz, um der Gesamtpolitik eine &uuml;bergreifende
Orientierung zu geben, an einen Zentralstaat. 
</P>
<P>
Der Maastricht-Vertrag geht - wie Sie wissen - einen anderen Weg. Die W&auml;hrungsunion
wird starten ohne eine konstitutionell verfa&szlig;te Politische Union oder gar
einen F&ouml;deralstaat. Und es liegt auch kein von allen akzeptierter Fahrplan
dorthin in der Schublade.
</P>
<P>
Aber wenn <I>explizite Institutionen</I> die notwendige Kongruenz in der W&auml;hrungsunion
nicht sichern, dann mu&szlig; es <I>implizite Gemeinsamkeiten</I> geben: ein
gemeinsames Einsch&auml;tzen von Situationen, ein &auml;hnliches Empfinden f&uuml;r
Werte und Priorit&auml;ten.
</P>
<P>
Die W&auml;hrungsunion nach dem Maastrichter Muster braucht eine Art implizite
Politische &quot;Quasi-Union&quot;. Das hei&szlig;t
</P>
<UL>
<LI>erstens eine erprobte gemeinsame Stabilit&auml;tskultur
</LI>
<LI>und zweitens die Bereitschaft insbesondere der Fiskalpolitik - wenn schon
nicht die Souver&auml;nit&auml;t aufzugeben - so doch eine Regelbindung
einzugehen und effektive Schranken zu setzen.
</LI>
</UL>
<CENTER><H2>VIII</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Und genau um diese beiden Elemente geht es heute: Erf&uuml;llung der Kriterien
und Stabilit&auml;tspakt.
</P>
<P>
Die Kriterien testen, wie weit ein Land auf dem Weg zu einer dauerhaften
Stabilit&auml;tskultur fortgeschritten ist. Alle im Vertrag festgelegten
Kriterien sind dabei wichtig. Die L&auml;nder, die teilnehmen m&ouml;chten, m&uuml;ssen
sie dauerhaft und nachhaltig erf&uuml;llen.
</P>
<P>
Das gilt auch f&uuml;r die finanzpolitischen Kriterien. Das Europ&auml;ische W&auml;hrungsinstitut
hat in seinem j&uuml;ngsten Konvergenzbericht festgestellt:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Die Verringerung des Defizits durch Ma&szlig;nahmen mit einmaliger
Wirkung gew&auml;hrleistet keine dauerhafte Konsolidierung. Gro&szlig;e
Aufmerksamkeit mu&szlig; der Substanz und nicht der Buchungsmethode bei der
Messung der Defizite und der Schuldenst&auml;nde geschenkt werden.&quot;
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Die W&auml;hrungsunion braucht zus&auml;tzlich einen griffigen Stabilit&auml;tspakt.
Und ein solcher Pakt kann, wie das Europ&auml;ische W&auml;hrungsinstitut
schreibt,
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;... kein Ersatz f&uuml;r die &uuml;berzeugende Konsolidierung der &ouml;ffentlichen
Haushalte im Vorfeld der W&auml;hrungsunion sein.&quot;
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Er ist die notwendige Erg&auml;nzung. Der Stabilit&auml;tspakt fragt, ob die L&auml;nder
bereit sind, mit ihrer eigenen Finanzpolitik R&uuml;cksicht zu nehmen auf die
Stabilit&auml;t der gemeinsamen W&auml;hrung. 
</P>
<P>
Das ist keine deutsche &quot;Gro&szlig;mannssucht&quot;. Im Gegenteil, in einer
W&auml;hrungsunion k&ouml;nnen gerade die gro&szlig;en Staaten durch
finanzpolitisches Fehlverhalten der Gemeinschaft schaden. Der Stabilit&auml;tspakt
sch&uuml;tzt die Kleinen vor einem Fehlverhalten der Gro&szlig;en.
</P>
<P>
Auch deshalb ist es bedauerlich, da&szlig; die bisherigen Vorschl&auml;ge der
EU-Kommission zum Stabilit&auml;tspakt hinter dem Konsens von Dublin zur&uuml;ckbleiben.
</P>
<P>
Der Euro braucht ein solides &ouml;konomisches und politisches Fundament. Damit
der Euro von Beginn an das Vertrauen der B&uuml;rger und der M&auml;rkte
gewinnt. Und damit die W&auml;hrungsunion dauerhaft Bestand haben kann.
</P>
<P>
Jedes Land, das alle Kriterien erf&uuml;llt und das bereit ist, die Konsequenten
der gemeinsamen W&auml;hrung zu akzeptieren, bereichert die W&auml;hrungsunion.
</P>
<P>
Aber praktisch alle L&auml;nder m&uuml;ssen sich noch erheblich anstrengen.
Einen Rabatt f&uuml;r Gr&uuml;ndungsmitglieder sieht der Maastricht-Vertrag zu
Recht nicht vor.
</P>
<P>
Das gilt auch f&uuml;r Deutschland. Das &ouml;ffentliche Defizit in Deutschland
liegt 1995 und '96 deutlich &uuml;ber 3%. Damit hat Deutschland in diesen beiden
Jahren die Maastricht-Qualifikation eindeutig verfehlt.
</P>
<P>
Und sicher mu&szlig; auch Italien noch einiges tun. Obgleich Italien beachtliche
Fortschritte erzielt hat, die auch anderswo gesehen und anerkannt werden.
</P>
<P>
Ich freue mich, da&szlig; die italienische Lira wieder am Wechselkursmechanismus
des EWS teilnimmt. Die Lira ist herzlich willkommen. &Uuml;brigens h&auml;tte es
Deutschland auch im Herbst 1992 gerne gesehen, w&auml;re die Lira im
Wechselkursmechanismus geblieben. Italien entschied sich damals anders.
</P>
<P>
Italien ist auf einem guten Weg. Und gerade zwei aus der Banca d'Italia
hervorgegangene Pers&ouml;nlichkeiten, Lamberto Dini und Carlo Ciampi, haben
daran entscheidenden Anteil.
</P>
<P>
Ich hoffe, da&szlig; Italien den eingeschlagenen Weg konsequent weitergeht. Denn
Carlo Ciampi hat zu Recht am vergangenen Dienstag vor einem Ausschu&szlig; des
Senats darauf hingewiesen:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Wir m&uuml;ssen uns sehr bewu&szlig;t sein, da&szlig; der
Wiedereintritt in den Wechselkursmechanismus etwas v&ouml;llig anderes ist als
der Eintritt in die W&auml;hrungsunion.&quot;
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Europa braucht ein stabiles und starkes Italien. Und Italien braucht dauerhafte
Solidit&auml;t und eine stabile W&auml;hrung.

Ein geordnetes Geldwesen ist ein wesentlicher Faktor und zugleich ein Spiegel
der Wirtschaft und der Kultur.
</P>
<P>
Zu Beginn meines Vortrages habe ich eine gro&szlig;artige Kulturleistung des
mittelalterlichen Florenz &uuml;bergangen.
</P>
<P>
Im Jahre 1252 pr&auml;gte Florenz die erste Goldm&uuml;nze des Mittelalters, den
fiorino d'oro.
</P>
<P>
Damit leitete Florenz einen neuen Abschnitt in der Geschichte des europ&auml;ischen
Geldwesens ein: die Hinwendung des Abendlandes zur Goldw&auml;hrung. Der
Goldfloren fand - wie jede erfolgreiche Innovation - seine Nachahmer, darunter
den Gulden in Deutschland.
</P>
<P>
Die Geschichtsb&uuml;cher berichten heute &uuml;ber den fiorino d'oro:

The European economy between global markets and internal challenges
</H1>
<H3>Jean Monnet Lecture before the European University Institute in Florence on
November 28, 1996</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<CENTER><H2>I</H2></CENTER>
<P>
World economy and globalisation, efficiency and innovation -these are the key
terms of economic debate these days. The spirit of Florence once opened the way
to the global and rational-economic thinking of our times.
</P>
<P>
Florentine thinkers extended the European horizon to encompass the world which
surrounds Europe.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Amerigo Vespucci came back with news of the New World to which he finally
gave his name.
</LI>
<LI>Leonardo da Vinci drew the first map of the world which included America.
</LI>
<LI>Galileo Galilei produced the first detailed heliocentric picture of the
world.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Again, Florence was a leading centre of the early commercial revolution; today's
global markets have emerged as the late successors of that revolution.
</P>
<P>
In the 13th century Florentine merchants began to develop a close network of
branches far from their domestic offices. They no longer purchased and sold
their goods at trade fairs but direct at the places of production and sale.
</P>
<P>
Two revolutionary innovations accompanied this at the time: double-entry
bookkeeping and - as a financial instrument -the bill of exchange.
</P>
<P>
The double nature of each financial innovation became evident even at that time:
</P>
<P>
it facilitated the financing of production and trade. At the same time, it
constituted a financial market in which lucrative abritrage was possible because
whoever was well informed about the prices of bills of exchange in the
individual trading centres - as indeed the Florentine merchants were through
their agents - was able to realise substantial profits.
</P>
<P>
Economic integration - whether within Europe or worldwide -is not an invention
of our days.
</P>
<P>
The American economist Paul Krugman suggested that the year 1869 should be
chosen if one wanted to mark the start of modern globalisation, i.e. the year in
which both the Suez Canal and the Union Pacific railways were completed.
</P>
<P>
It is a fact that the world experienced a period of intensive integration
between the middle of the 19th century and the First World War. The sharp growth
of world trade after 1950, which in some cases continued well into the
seventies, can be interpreted as the restoration of the previously existing wave
of integration.
</P>
<P>
In this light, international economic integration - whether during the
Renaissance period or the 20th century - is old hat.
</P>
<CENTER><H2>II</H2></CENTER>
<P>
What makes it possible, then, to suggest with the term of globalisation today
that a new quality, a new reality has been achieved or is about to materialise?
</P>
<P>
Modern globalisation is characterised mainly by three innovative structural
features:
</P>
<P>
The first feature is the distinct increase in intra-industrial trade.
</P>
<P>
The traditional foreign trade of an industrial nation in earlier times was
conducted essentially according to the classical pattern: industrial finished
goods in exchange for raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Today the industrial countries are largely trading among each other in products
which are highly sophisticated but basically similar. The generally popular
example from the motor industry: Italians drive VW and Porsche cars, Germans
Fiat and Ferrari cars.
</P>
<P>
The second feature is the close integration of economies even at the production
stage.
</P>
<P>
Today, enterprises, or even entire industries, are largely able to split the
chain of value added geographically. They thus consistently make use of regional
locational advantages.
</P>
<P>
This splitting-up gives the developing countries the opportunity of competing
not only in the traditional labour-intensive industries, such as textiles. Some
of them are also involved in the manufacture of high-tech products, such as
computers.
</P>
<P>
And this brings us to the third feature: the rapid economic rise of a number of
newly industrialising countries.
</P>
<P>
There are two groups of factors behind these new structures.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, political factors:
</P>
<P>
Trade in goods, services and capital has been liberalised within regional areas,
and increasingly also at the global level. And, above all, many developing and
newly industrialising countries in Asia and in Latin America as well as in the
countries in transition in central and eastern Europe have adopted, internally,
market-economy systems.
</P>
<P>
Many Asian countries are forming high domestic savings. They are therefore able
to make sizeable investments to build up their economy and to maintain a high
export ratio at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, globalisation is also being based on technological factors at an
increasingly rapid pace:
</P>
<P>
The costs of transport and communication have fallen in the past few years, in
some cases dramatically. Enterprises are therefore able to coordinate production
processes efficiently at different locations. Employees on different continents
can even work simultaneously on one and the same project. At the same time,
technical know-how has become more sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
Above all, expertise and know-how are spreading essentially faster and more
comprehensively than ever before. And this process will accelerate, if anything,
in future.
</P>
<P>
Where is all of this leading us?
</P>
<P>
First of all, locational competition has become much fiercer worldwide and will
probably intensify even more. It is not only enterprises which are competing
with one another, but regions, too. The entire political setting, above all the
tax and social security systems, play an evermore important role as a locational
factor.
</P>
<P>
Having an edge on your competitor does not last for ever. Regions and industries
have to look continually for new ways of gaining an advantage. Flexibility is
what counts in the end: that is to say, the ability to adjust and to cope with
the never-ending task of making structural changes.
</P>
<CENTER><H2>III</H2></CENTER>
<P>
The most radical change has, no doubt, occurred in the international financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
The financial markets exploit technical progress in data processing and in
telecommunications, in particular. Today they are able to transmit huge amounts
around the globe in fractions of a second.
</P>
<P>
The technological potential has brought new structures to fruition within a few
years.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>New complex instruments, such as derivatives, revolutionise trade in risks.
</LI>
<LI>The professional fund manager crowds out the private investor as a player
in the financial markets on a considerable scale.
</LI>
<LI>This means a change in behaviour. The fund manager is oriented more to the
short-term performance of the portfolio than to the longer-term one.
</LI>
<LI>Today the markets record and process a virtually infinite flow of
information.
</LI>
<LI>This increases the role of expectations in investment decisions.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The financial markets channel the capital flows rapidly and efficiently to
productive uses. They thus raise the global economic growth potential.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the markets are largely able to channel the capital
flows past a particular country or to withdraw capital from that country.
</P>
<P>
The reason for this is that the financial markets assess a country. They do not
only analyse current data but try to estimate to what extent a country is able
and willing to deal with its longer-term problems. It is their expectations
regarding these points which count.
</P>
<P>
The markets start to distrust a country if they receive signals that the
longer-term problems are being neglected there. Indicators of this may be, above
all, a monetary or fiscal policy which gives rise to doubts about a longer-term
anti-inflation course.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the financial markets assume the role of supervisors. They may
punish even the first signs of an easy monetary policy and an undisciplined
budget policy. They withdraw capital from that country and demand a high premium
on capital market rates.
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the financial markets may misjudge the situation which then leads to
exaggerated reactions. In most cases, however, these exaggerations are only of a
short-term nature.
</P>
<P>
Over the longer term, the fundamentals are decisive. In most cases it is
credibility which is particularly important.
</P>
<CENTER><H2>IV</H2></CENTER>
<P>
On balance, globalisation has the following repercussions for national policies:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The entire economic constitution, i.e. the social security systems,
regulations on the goods and labour markets, tax policy, the legal system, all
these are subject to locational competition.
</LI>
<LI>And monetary and fiscal policies are permanently tested by the
international financial markets.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Globalisation therefore limits the sovereignty of national policy-makers. As is
the case whenever competition increases, suppliers have to be guided more
strongly by the market.
</P>
<P>
However, practically all countries are subject to the rules of a global economy.
Why - and this is the core of the problems -why is it that Europe seems to find
it particularly difficult to accommodate these rules?
</P>
<P>
This probably owes something to the fact that precisely in Europe the
consequences of globalisation coincide with existing structural economic
weaknesses, that they aggravate these weaknesses and thus make their solution
all the more urgent.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the fiercer worldwide locational competition, which demands a high
degree of flexibility and willingness to make structural change, coincides with
a rigid labour market and an inflexible social security system in many countries
of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Globalisation often meets with inflexible internal structures. This leads to
high unemployment, primarily among the less qualified.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, by contrast, globalisation meets with a labour market
which is much more flexible by tradition. In the States this leads to a high
growth in employment although this means that there is a greater differentiation
in incomes.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the narrower scope of tax and fiscal policy in Europe often meets with
a government which is largely overburdened with claims and tasks.
</P>
<P>
This overburdening is reflected in high government debt, but also in the pension
system which, in the light of demographic changes, will find it difficult to
keep its promises to the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
Past internal mistakes and globalisation are linked.
</P>
<P>
On the expenditure side, the public authorities today have to spend sizeable
funds to service the accrued debt.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the financial markets critically question the size and
sustainability of the deficits at any time. A negative judgement would result in
a further surge in the interest rate burden.
</P>
<P>
On the receipts side, an erosion of the tax base might be threatening. The
increasing burden of taxes and social security contributions tends to foster the
shadow economy at home.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, enterprises have become more flexible regarding locational
competition as a result of present technology and modern transport. It is easier
for them to shift earnings and to avoid taxes. And the global markets are
legally capable of frustrating national regulations.
</P>
<P>
The internal structural weaknesses in Europe do not have their origin in
globalisation. But globalisation aggravates the weaknesses and makes them
evident.
</P>
<P>
This means a loss of competitiveness and attractiveness for new investment and a
loss of employment.
</P>
<P>
And this causes unease.
</P>
<CENTER><H2>V</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Europe must not try to run away from these challenges. Fiercer competition is a
reality.
</P>
<P>
One may hope to harmonise one or two parameters of locational competition - say,
in the field of taxation - within Europe. One may also hope to improve some of
the rules of the game through worldwide cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Nobody should believe, however, that Europe will be able to impose &quot;its&quot;
rules or its welfare state model on the world.
</P>
<P>
This is shown by the discussion in the WTO under its Director-General Renato
Ruggiero about the extent to which the WTO rules can be extended to encompass
labour and social standards. The first WTO conference of ministers in Singapore
in two weeks' time will probably deal, <I>inter alia</I>, with this sensitive
subject.
</P>
<P>
Many WTO members object. They fear that the industrial countries mainly wish to
impede cheap imports by imposing standards. In the world of today the industrial
countries cannot simply ignore the political vote of the others.
</P>
<P>
Globalisation is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
Europe cannot do anything to prevent other countries from orienting themselves
increasingly to the market economy and thus raising their efficiency. Nor can
Europe cut off existing integration either worldwide or within the single market
without weakening its own economy considerably.
</P>
<P>
Europe cannot reverse technical progress either. On the contrary, this cannot be
stopped and will accelerate, if anything
</P>
<P>
And, above all, policy makers in Europe cannot raise themselves - as recently
suggested by a French sociologist -above economic realities and establish a
European welfare state in a constitutional act, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
High-flying constructivism invariably comes crashing to the ground.
</P>
<P>
That approach overlooks the economic conditions of global markets and the
inherent contradictions of a welfare state that is getting out of hand. Above
all, the approach overlooks the force with which economic reality may crush
faulty political constructs.
</P>
<P>
All this is reality - whether we like it or not.
</P>
<P>
This reminds me of the well-known anecdote of the three Florentine envoys. When
introducing themselves to a foreign duke, they said: &quot;We are citizens and
envoys of Florence if you like it.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Afterwards the three were terribly annoyed about this meaningless phrase. So
they revised their address and said: &quot;Whether you like it or not, we are
both citizens and envoys of Florence.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Today the envoys of globalisation visit the European economy; but they will
certainly not add &quot;if you like it
</P>
<CENTER><H2>VI</H2></CENTER>
<P>
What role can the currency play in coping with the enormous challenges? Of
course, the currency, whether it is called D-Mark, franc, lira or euro, cannot
solve the structural problems as such.
</P>
<P>
There is no alternative for Europe but to reform the welfare state so as to
preserve it in substance. This includes more self-responsibility, more
initiative of the individual, more subsidiarity on the part of citizens.
</P>
<P>
But policy makers can demand this legitimately only if stable money gives the
citizen a chance to provide for himself and to make sensible forward-looking
decisions.
</P>
<P>
And stable money is important for creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
The reason for this is that it helps enterprises to obtain the capital required
for investment on favourable terms. The citizens have stronger incentives to
save. The domestic capital supply increases. And the international financial
markets consider a stable currency as an advantage in their investment
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Therefore it can basically be said that the participants in monetary union will
only have a chance to solve their problems if the euro is lastingly stable.
</P>
<P>
Carlo Ciampi recently put this as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;It is in the interest of Europe to have a strong euro. We cannot
afford to replace the strong D-Mark by a weak euro. This would be a bad thing
for Europe as a whole.&quot;
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
I can only agree with this.
</P>
<CENTER><H2>VII</H2></CENTER>
<P>
But the monetary union envisaged in Europe does not relieve us from economic
constraints. On the contrary, even more so than globalisation, monetary union
means a restriction of national sovereignty, of the national room for manoeuvre
and of &quot;do-it-alone&quot; approaches.
</P>
<P>
The participating countries will lose the instrument of exchange rate
adjustments among each other. This increases the pressure for internal
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
But a single currency demands even more.
</P>
<P>
In a monetary union the countries participating must tackle and solve their
economic problems and challenges in a similar way and at a similar pace. Severe
problems will arise if each country gives a fundamentally different response
from that of its partners.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, an economic problem will arise if the various countries actually
respond differently in their basic stance
</P>
<P>
Countries which energetically implement the right solution will soon be more
competitive than countries which react incorrectly or hesitantly. There will no
longer be an exchange rate to absorb this. Economic developments would diverge.
Internal tensions would result.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, a political problem will arise to the extent that individual countries
are unable to realise their desire for a different policy because their
integration in the monetary union prevents them from doing so. Political
tensions would result. Europe might soon become the scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, whatever tensions were to arise, the international financial markets
would hold the euro liable for them.
</P>
<P>
A monetary union needs similar responses from the participating economies and
states to major economic questions of the time.
</P>
<P>
This is no academic, abstract requirement because the economic challenges facing
these countries will not arise some time in the distant future. They are on
their doorstep.
</P>
<P>
How can Europe achieve the necessary congruence?
</P>
<P>
One solution would be a far-reaching, formally constituted political union, the
road to a common government authority.
</P>
<P>
The individual countries would more and more restrict their sovereignty.
Although the diversity of Europe would at all events require a federal
structure, the responsibility for giving a general direction to policies as a
whole would be borne by a centralised state.
</P>
<P>
As you know, the Maastricht Treaty takes a different road. Monetary union will
start without a constitutionally established political union, let alone a
federal state. And there is no generally accepted timetable on the drawing board
for achieving that goal.
</P>
<P>
But if there are no <I>explicit institutions </I>which ensure the necessary
congruence in monetary union, there must be <I>implicit common features</I>: a
common assessment of situations, a similar feeling for values and priorities.
</P>
<P>
Monetary union according to the Maastricht Treaty requires a sort of implicit
political &quot;quasi-union&quot;. This means
</P>
<UL>
<LI>firstly, a tested common stability culture
</LI>
<LI>and, secondly, the willingness, particularly on the part of fiscal policy
makers, to commit themselves to rules and to set up effective barriers - even if
they do not wish to abandon sovereignty.
</LI></UL>
<P>
</P>
<CENTER><H2>VIII</H2></CENTER>
<P>
And it is precisely these two elements which matter today: meeting the criteria
and the stability pact.
</P>
<P>
The criteria are used to check how far a given country has advanced on the road
to a permanent stability culture. All criteria specified in the Treaty are
important for this. The countries which wish to participate must meet the
criteria on a lasting and sustained basis.
</P>
<P>
This also applies to the fiscal policy criteria. In its recent convergence
report the European Monetary Institute stated the following:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;... the improvement of the deficit by measures with a one-off effect
does not ensure sustainable consolidation and great attention will have to be
paid to the substance and not only to the accounting methods used in measuring
both deficits and debts ...&quot;
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Monetary union requires an additional rigid stability pact. And, as the European
Monetary Institute puts it, such a pact
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;cannot be a substitute for convincing fiscal consolidation prior to
monetary union.&quot;
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It is the necessary supplement. The stability pact raises the question of
whether the countries concerned are willing to pay due regard to the stability
of the single currency in their own fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
This is no German &quot;megalomania&quot;. On the contrary, in a monetary union
it is preceisely the large countries that may<B>
</B>harm the community through fiscal slippage. The stability pact protects the
small countries from mistakes made by the large countries.
</P>
<P>
That is why it is regrettable that the proposals so far submitted by the EU
Commission on the stability pact lag behind the consensus reached in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The euro needs sound economic and political foundations to ensure that it has
the confidence of the citizens and the markets from the outset and that monetary
union is permanently sustainable.
</P>
<P>
Every country which fulfils all the criteria and is prepared to accept the
consequences of the single currency will enrich the monetary union.
</P>
<P>
But virtually all countries still have to make considerable efforts. The
Maastricht Treaty rightly does not provide for a discount for the founder
members.
</P>
<P>
This applies to Germany as well. In 1995 the public sector deficit in Germany
clearly exceeded 3 % and will do so again in 1996. In these two years, Germany
has therefore clearly failed to meet the Maastricht criteria.
</P>
<P>
And Italy, too, has no doubt a lot to do although it has made considerable
progress, and this is seen and appreciated elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
I am pleased that the Italian lira is again participating in the EMS exchange
rate mechanism. The lira is warmly welcome. Incidentally, Germany would have
welcomed it in the autumn of 1992 if the lira had remained in the exchange rate
mechanism. At the time Italy took a different decision.
</P>
<P>
Italy is on the right track. And much of this is due to two members of the Banca
d'Italia, Lamberto Dini and Carlo Ciampi.
</P>
<P>
I hope that Italy will consistently follow the course adopted. Last Tuesday
Carlo Ciampi rightly stated the following before a senate committee:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;We must be very aware of the fact that re-entry into the exchange rate
mechanism is something completely different from entry into monetary union.&quot;
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Europe needs a stable and a strong Italy. And Italy needs lasting soundness and
a stable currency.
</P>
<CENTER><H2>IX</H2></CENTER>
<P>
An orderly monetary system is an essential factor and at the same time a mirror
of the economy and the culture.
</P>
<P>
At the start of my lecture I forgot to mention one superb cultural achievement
of medieval Florence.
</P>
<P>
In 1252 Florence minted the first gold coin of the middle ages, the <I>fiorino
d'oro</I>.
</P>
<P>
Florence thus introduced a new stage in the history of Europe's monetary system:
the turn of the western world to the gold standard. The gold florin - like any
successful innovation - was copied elsewhere, including Germany and its <I>gulden</I>.
</P>
<P>
Today the history books report the following on the <I>fiorino d'oro</I>:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Owing to its high quality, it was accepted in all market places without
hesitation.
</LI>
<LI>It became a standard of value that was accepted everywhere.
</LI>
<LI>It provided new stimuli to trade.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Today the question as to the extent to which the euro will introduce a new stage
in Europe's monetary system may be of very little relevance.
</P>
<P>
But if at some later date historians were to report the same on the euro as they
report today on the <I>fiorino d'oro</I>, this would no doubt be to the benefit
of Europe.

Robert Schuman Centre</H1>
<H1>A Unified and Simplified
Model of the European Communities Treaties and the
Treaty on European Union in Just One Treaty
</H1>
</CENTER>
<P>
At the request and with the funding of the European Parliament, the 
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/RSC/Welcome.html">Robert
Schuman Centre</A> at the European University Institute, Florence (in
collaboration with the <A HREF="http://www.iue.it/AEL/Welcome.html">Academy of
European Law</A>), has established, with the support of eminent European
Community law experts, a unified and simplified version of the European
Communities Treaties (EC Treaty, ECSC Treaty, EURATOM Treaty) and the Treaty on
European Union. 
</P>
<P>
The objective of the unified and simplified draft Treaty proposal is to improve
the readability and transparency of the above-mentioned Treaties, which have
been amended several times, but which have never been consolidated, nor brought
up to date. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the new version presents all articles of the Treaties which
are still in force as one single text. Obsolete articles have been deleted and
identical provisions consolidated.
</P>
<P>
 This single integrated text reflects European Union law as it stands. It does
not attempt to introduce simplifications which would amount to Treaty
amendments.  
</P>
<P>
It presents however an excellent basis for further consolidation, simplification
and rationalisation. The usefulness and, in some cases, imperativeness of these
steps becomes apparent throughout the draft Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
The draft Treaty contains 512 articles. If adopted this would abrogate 753
articles: from the Treaty on European Union (38 articles), from the Treaty
establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (117 articles), from the
Treaty establishing the European Community (337 articles), from the Treaty
establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (223 articles), from the
Single European Act (6 articles), from the Convention on certain Institutions
common to the European Communities (8 articles), from the Treaty establishing a
Single Council and a Single Commission of the European Communities (21
articles), and Articles 1, 2, 3(1), of the Act concerning the election of the
Representatives of the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The major gain from the draft Treaty is not to be found in the simple reduction
in the number of articles, but in the increase in the general transparency and
readability which is attained by introducing all the articles into one
systematically conceived document. 
</P>
<P>
The draft Treaty proposal has been prepared in response to the European
Council's request at its meeting, Florence, 21-22 June 1996, which called upon
the IGC &quot;to seek all possible ways of simplifying the Treaties so as to
make the Union's goals and operation easier for the public to understand.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Versions of the draft Treaty will shortly appear in French and German.  The
English and French short text versions will also appear on WWW, in English from
25 October, and French from 13 November at the following address:

The Robert Schuman Centre at the European University Institute is directed by
Professor Yves M&eacute;ny. The group of experts was coordinated by Professor
Claus-Dieter Ehlermann and composed of Professors Renaud Dehousse, Eduardo Garc&iacute;a
de Enterr&iacute;a, Jean-Victor Louis, Yves M&eacute;ny, Francis Snyder,
Giuseppe Tesauro. Armin von Bogdandy, lecturer at the Hunboldt Universit&auml;t
Berlin, acted as Rapporteur. The group was assisted by an advisory board
composed of Lord Jack MacKenzie-Stuart, former President of the Court of
Justice, Max Kohnstamm and Emile No&euml;l, former Presidents of the European
University Institute.  Editing was carried out by Simon Towle, translation of
French text by Fran&ccedil;ois Lafond, translation of the German text by
Christoph Schmid.  Administrative and technical support was provided by Fabian
Pereyra and Dervla Ramsay. 
</P>
<P>
The work accomplished at the Robert Schuman Centre of the European University
Institute in Florence was facilitated by a previous study undertaken (also at
the request of the European Parliament) by Professor Roland Bieber at the
University of Lausanne.

</P>
<H2>Annex</H2>
<P>
The provisions of the Treaties in force are rearranged in the draft Treaty in
five parts.
</P>
<P>
Part I lays down the general principles of the Union. Part II contains the
provisions relating to  citizenship of the Union. The majority of the provisions
have been rearranged in Parts III and IV. The draft Treaty distinguishes
institutional provisions contained in Part III, from procedural provisions and
competences, which are to be found in Part IV. This structure foresees that all
provisions in Part III shall be of general application to the activities of the
institutions throughout the areas of their competences; it follows a horizontal
approach. In contrast, Part IV generally adopts a vertical approach. This
reflects the actual structure of the TEU by creating three subparts: Part IVA
contains the provisions on the European Communities, Part IVB the provisions on
Common Foreign and Security Policy, and Part IVC the provisions on Cooperation
in the Fields of Justice and Home Affairs. Whilst this structure requires these
issues to be considered separately from the established &quot;Community&quot;
procedures, it nevertheless recognizes that they are introduced to the same
framework (because the institutions constituted in Part III are identical
throughout the Treaty). Furthermore, by inserting the so-called 2nd and 3rd
pillar provisions at the end of Part IV, this structure indicates that the
provisions of the Communities Treaties indeed have more weight in defining the
overall framework of the Union than the 2nd and 3rd pillar provisions. It thus
embodies the spirit of Art. A, paragraph 3, sentence 1 TEU. However, this
vertical approach could not be followed throughout. Certain provisions in Part
IVA, Title 1, namely some of those concerning the instruments, procedures and
the ECJ, have a broader scope. This solution, albeit far from ideal, appears as
the most appropriate given the draft Treaty's aim of maintaining the law as it
stands. In the interests of transparency of European law, it would be highly
beneficial if the IGC were to consolidate the instruments, procedure and review
mechanisms, at least under Part IVA. Part V brings together the final provisions
of the TEU with the provisions of the other Treaties which are of general
significance (e.g. Art. 227 TEC).

<P>
A la demande et financ&eacute; par le Parlement europ&eacute;en, le 
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/RSC/Welcome.html">Centre
Robert Schuman</A> de l'Institut universitaire europ&eacute;en de Florence (avec
la collaboration de <A HREF="http://www.iue.it/AEL/Welcome.html">l'Acad&eacute;mie
de droit europ&eacute;en</A>) a r&eacute;alis&eacute;, avec l'aide d'un groupe d'&eacute;minents
experts de droit communautaire, une version unique et simplifi&eacute;e des diff&eacute;rents
trait&eacute;s r&eacute;gissant l'Union europ&eacute;enne et les Communaut&eacute;s
europ&eacute;ennes (trait&eacute; CEE, trait&eacute; CECA, trait&eacute; CEEA).
</A></P>
<P>
L'objectif de la version unique et simplifi&eacute;e est de faciliter la lecture
et d'am&eacute;liorer la transparence de l'ensemble des trait&eacute;s
sus-mentionn&eacute;s, modifi&eacute;s plusieurs fois, mais jamais fusionn&eacute;s
ou actualis&eacute;s.
</P>
<P>
La nouvelle version pr&eacute;sente pour la premi&egrave;re fois
<U>dans un seul texte</U>, les articles de tous les trait&eacute;s qui sont
encore en vigueur. Les articles obsol&egrave;tes ont &eacute;t&eacute; supprim&eacute;s
et les dispositions identiques fusionn&eacute;es.
</P>
<P>
Cette version unique correspond &agrave; l'&eacute;tat actuel du droit de
l'Union europ&eacute;enne. Il n'a pas pour objet de proc&eacute;der &agrave; des
simplifications qui exigeraient des modifications substantielles &agrave; la
lettre et &agrave; l'esprit des textes en vigueur.   
</P>
<P>
En revanche, il pr&eacute;sente <U>une excellente base pour de nouvelles
consolidation, simplification et rationalisation</U> : l'utilit&eacute;, et dans
certains cas, la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de ces pas suppl&eacute;mentaires
deviennent &eacute;videntes tout au long de la lecture du projet de trait&eacute;.
</P>
<P>
Cette version du trait&eacute; contient 512 articles. S'il est adopt&eacute;,
cela reviendrait &agrave; supprimer 753 articles : du trait&eacute; de l'Union
europ&eacute;enne (38 articles), du trait&eacute; instituant la Communaut&eacute;
europ&eacute;enne du charbon et de l'acier (117 articles), du trait&eacute;
instituant la Communaut&eacute; europ&eacute;enne de l'&eacute;nergie atomique
(223 articles, de l'Acte unique europ&eacute;en (6 articles), de la Convention
relative &agrave; certaines institutions communes aux Communaut&eacute;s europ&eacute;ennes
(8 articles), du trait&eacute; instituant un Conseil unique et une Commission
unique des Communaut&eacute;s europ&eacute;ennes (21 articles) et des articles
1, 2, 3(1) de l'acte portant &eacute;lection des repr&eacute;sentants au
Parlement europ&eacute;en.
</P>
<P>
N&eacute;anmoins, le principal int&eacute;r&ecirc;t du projet de trait&eacute;
ne r&eacute;side pas dans la seule r&eacute;duction du nombre des articles, mais
bien <U>dans une am&eacute;lioration g&eacute;n&eacute;rale de la transparence
et de la clart&eacute;</U> gr&acirc;ce &agrave;  la r&eacute;union de tous les
articles dans un document unique.

La r&eacute;daction d'une version unique et simplifi&eacute;e des diff&eacute;rents
trait&eacute;s r&eacute;gissant l'Union europ&eacute;enne et les Communaut&eacute;s
europ&eacute;ennes r&eacute;pond &agrave; la requ&ecirc;te du Conseil europ&eacute;en
qui, lors de sa r&eacute;union les 21 et 22 juin 1996 &agrave; Florence,

</P>
<H2>Annexe</H2>
<P>
Les dispositions des trait&eacute;s en vigueur sont r&eacute;organis&eacute;s
dans le projet de trait&eacute; en cinq parties. La premi&egrave;re partie
expose les principes g&eacute;n&eacute;raux de l'Union. La deuxi&egrave;me
partie contient les dispositions d&eacute;finissant les modalit&eacute;s de la
citoyennet&eacute; europ&eacute;enne.
</P>
<P>
La majorit&eacute; des dispositions ont &eacute;t&eacute; restructur&eacute;es
dans les troisi&egrave;me et quatri&egrave;me parties.  Le projet de trait&eacute;
distingue les dispositions institutionnelles, contenues dans la troisi&egrave;me
partie, des dispositions proc&eacute;durales et des comp&eacute;tences, regroup&eacute;es
dans la quatri&egrave;me partie.
</P>
<P>
Cette nouvelle structure pr&eacute;voit que toutes les dispositions de la troisi&egrave;me
partie concernent le fonctionnement g&eacute;n&eacute;ral des institutions dans
leur domaine de comp&eacute;tences respectives; il s'agit d'une approche
horizontale. En revanche, la quatri&egrave;me partie adopte g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement
une approche verticale. Cela refl&egrave;te davantage l'actuelle structure du
trait&eacute; de l'Union europ&eacute;enne, en cr&eacute;ant trois sous-parties:
la quatri&egrave;me partie A contient les dispositions des Communaut&eacute;s
europ&eacute;ennes, la quatri&egrave;me partie B, les dispositions concernant
une politique &eacute;trang&egrave;re et de s&eacute;curit&eacute; commune  et
la quatri&egrave;me partie C, les dispositions sur la coop&eacute;ration dans
les domaines de la justice et des affaires int&eacute;rieures. Bien que cette
structure reconnaisse de fait que de tels domaines doivent &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute;s
s&eacute;par&eacute;ment des proc&eacute;dures de la &quot;Communaut&eacute;&quot;
existante, elle  permet cependant de les introduire dans un m&ecirc;me cadre
(parce que les institutions cr&eacute;&eacute;es dans la troisi&egrave;me partie
sont identiques pour l'ensemble du projet de trait&eacute;). De plus, en
introduisant les dispositions des &quot;2&egrave;me et 3&egrave;me piliers&quot;
&agrave; la fin de la quatri&egrave;me partie, on souligne que les dispositions
des trait&eacute;s des Communaut&eacute;s d&eacute;finissent davatange
l'ensemble du projet de trait&eacute; de l'Union que les dispositions plus sp&eacute;cifiques
des &quot;2&egrave;me et 3&egrave;me piliers&quot;. On est ainsi plus fid&egrave;le
&agrave; l'esprit de la premi&egrave;re phrase, premier alin&eacute;a de
l'article A du TUE. Cependant, cette approche verticale ne peut &ecirc;tre adopt&eacute;e
syst&eacute;matiquement. Certaines dispositions dans le titre 1 de la quatri&egrave;me
partie A, en particulier celles relatives aux instruments, proc&eacute;dures et &agrave;
la Cour de Justice, ont un objectif plus ample. Une telle solution, bien que n'&eacute;tant
pas id&eacute;ale, apparait la plus appropri&eacute;e &agrave; l'objectif du
projet de trait&eacute;, qui est de maintenir le droit existant. Dans un souci
d'am&eacute;liorer la transparence du droit europ&eacute;en, il serait n&eacute;cessaire
que la CIG renforce les instruments, les proc&eacute;dures et les m&eacute;canismes
juridictionnels, au moins dans la quatri&egrave;me partie A. 
</P>
<P>
La cinqui&egrave;me partie regroupe les dispositions finales du trait&eacute;
sur l'Union europ&eacute;enne avec les dispositions des autres trait&eacute;s
qui ont une port&eacute;e g&eacute;n&eacute;rale (ex. article 227 du TCE).

<H1>Centro Robert Schuman</H1>
<H1>Una versione unificata e semplificata dei Trattati che governano l'Unione
europea e le Comunit&agrave; europee</H1>
</CENTER>
<P>
Su richiesta del Parlamento europeo, il 
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/RSC/Welcome.html">Centro Robert
Schuman</A> dell'Istituto universitario europeo di Firenze (in collaborazione
con <A HREF="http://www.iue.it/AEL/Welcome.html">l'Academia di diritto europeo</A>)
ha realizzato, con l'assistenza di un gruppo di eminenti esperti del diritto
comunitario, una versione unificata e semplificata dei diversi Trattati che
governano l'Unione europea e le Comunit&agrave; europee (Trattato CEE, Trattato
CECA, Trattato CEEA).
</P>
<P>
L'obiettivo della versione unificata e semplificata &egrave; di migliorare la
comprensibilit&agrave; e la trasparenza dei trattati sopra indicati, i quali
sono stati emendati in numerose occasioni ma non sono mai stati n&eacute;
unificati n&eacute; aggiornati.
</P>
<P>
La nuova versione presenta per la prima volta <U>in un unico testo</U> tutti
gli articoli ancora in vigore dei Trattati. Gli articoli obsoleti sono stati
soppressi e le disposizioni tra loro identiche sono state accorpate.
</P>
<P>
Questa versione unitaria riflette lo stato attuale del diritto dell'Unione
europea. Non intende operare semplificazioni che rappresenterebbero degli
emendamenti al testo dei Trattati.
</P>
<P>
Tuttavia, essa costituisce <U>un'eccellente base per ulteriori interventi di
unificazione, semplificazione e razionalizzazione</U>: l'utilit&agrave; e, in
taluni casi, la necessit&agrave; di questi ulteriori interventi appaiono
evidenti alla lettura del progetto di Trattato.
</P>
<P>
Questo progetto di Trattato contiene 512 articoli. Qualora adottato, porterebbe
alla soppressione di 753 articoli: del Trattato sull'Unione europea (38
articoli), del Trattato che istituisce la Comunit&agrave; europea del carbone e
dell'acciaio (117 articoli), del Trattato che istituisce la Comunit&agrave;
economica europea (337 articoli), del Trattato che istituisce la Comunit&agrave;
europea dell'energia atomica (223 articoli), dell'Atto unico europeo (6
articoli), della Convenzione di alcune istituzioni comuni alle Comunit&agrave;
europee (8 articoli), del Trattato che istituisce un unico Consiglio e un'unica
Commissione delle Comunit&agrave; europee (21 articoli) e gli articoli 1, 2 e 3
dell'Atto riguardante l'elezione dei rappresentanti al Parlamento europeo.
</P>
<P>
Il principale vantaggio del progetto di Trattato non deriva dalla semplice
riduzione del numero degli articoli, bens&igrave; dal
<U>miglioramento generale della trasparenza e della chiarezza</U> che si
ottiene grazie alla riunione di tutti gli articoli in un documento unitario.
</P>
<P>
La redazione di una versione unificata e semplificata dei diversi Trattati che
governano l'Unione europea e le Comunit&agrave; europee risponde alla richiesta
del Consiglio europeo che, nella sua riunione del 21 e 22 giugno 1996 svoltasi a
Firenze, ha domandato alla CIG di &quot;vagliare tutte le possibilit&agrave; di
semplificazione dei Trattati al fine di rendere le finalit&agrave; e il
funzionamento dell'Unione pi&ugrave; comprensibili per i cittadini.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Entro breve, versioni appariranno in lingua francese e tedesco. Versioni corte
del testo appariranno ugualmente sul www, in inglese dal 25 ottobre, in francese
dal 13 novembre, all'indirizzo seguente:

<B>Allegato</B>
</P>
<P>
Nel progetto di Trattato le disposizioni dei Trattati in vigore sono
riorganizzate in cinque parti. La Parte I espone i princ&igrave;pi generali del
progetto di Trattato. La Parte II contiene le disposizioni riguardanti lo
statuto dell'individuo in quanto cittadino dell'Unione.
</P>
<P>
La maggior parte delle disposizioni sono state riorganizzate nelle Parti III e
IV. Il progetto di Trattato distingue tra le disposizioni istituzionali
contenute nella Parte III, e le disposizioni procedurali e le competenze che si
trovano nella Parte IV.
</P>
<P>
Questa struttura prevede che tutte le disposizioni contenute nella Parte III
siano di applicazione generale alle attivit&agrave; delle istituzioni in tutte
le loro aree di competenza; adotta dunque un approccio orizzontale. La Parte IV,
invece, adotta generalmente un approccio verticale. Questo riflette l'attuale
struttura del Trattato sull'Unione europea creando tre ulteriori suddivisioni:
la Parte IV A contiene le disposizioni riguardanti le Comunit&agrave; europee,
la Parte IV B le disposizioni sulle Politiche degli esteri e di sicurezza
comuni, e la Parte IV C le disposizioni sulla Cooperazione in materia di
giustizia e di affari interni. Bench&eacute; questa struttura richieda che
queste tematiche siano trattate separatamente dalle normali procedure della &quot;Comunit&agrave;&quot;,
essa riconosce tuttavia che queste vengono introdotte nello stesso quadro di
riferimento (poich&eacute; le istituzioni che trovano il loro fondamento nella
Parte III sono le stesse in tutto il Trattato). Inoltre, inserendo le
disposizioni riguardanti i cosiddetti secondo e terzo pilastro alla fine della
Parte IV, questa struttura suggerisce che le disposizioni dei Trattati delle
Comunit&agrave; hanno di fatto una rilevanza maggiore nella definizione nella
strutturazione complessiva dell'Unione, rispetto alle disposizioni riguardanti
il secondo e il terzo pilastro. In tal modo essa d&agrave; espressione allo
spirito dell'Articolo A, paragrafo 3, comma 1 del Trattato sull'Unione europea.
Tuttavia, non &egrave; stato possibile adottare senza eccezioni questo approccio
verticale. Alcune disposizioni della Parte IV A, Titolo I, ovvero alcune
disposizioni concernenti gli strumenti, le procedure e la Corte di Giustizia
europea, hanno un'area di applicazione pi&ugrave; ampia. Tale soluzione, seppur
tutt'altro che ideale, appare la pi&ugrave; aderente allo scopo del progetto di
Trattato di mantenere la legge nel suo stato presente. Nell'interesse della
trasparenza della legge europea, sarebbe altamente auspicabile che la CIG
decidesse di unificare gli strumenti, le procedure e i meccanismi di revisione,
almeno sotto la Parte IV A.
</P>
<P>
La Parte V raccoglie insieme le disposizioni finali del Trattato sull'Unione
europea e le disposizioni degli altri Trattati che presentano un carattere di
generalit&agrave; (per esempio, l'art 227 del TCE).

Sedici ricercatori dell'Istituto Universitario Europeo  di Firenze faranno parte
del gruppo dei circa 150 osservatori  che  l'Italia invier&agrave; in Albania
per assicurare la regolarit&agrave; delle elezioni amministrative che avranno
luogo in questo paese il 20 ottobre.  Si tratta di  una missione di monitoraggio
organizzata dal Ministero degli Affari Esteri su richiesta delle autorit&agrave;
albanesi, nel quadro delle attivit&agrave; del Consiglio d'Europa.
</P>
<P>
Il gruppo di osservatori, dopo aver partecipato ad un briefing informativo
presso la SIOI (Societ&agrave; Italiana per le Organizzazioni Internazionali),
curato da esperti del Ministero degli Esteri e del Ministero dell'Interno,
partir&agrave; da Roma venerdi 18 ottobre. Il rientro dall'Albania &egrave;
previsto per mercoledi 23.
</P>
<P>
Il gruppo inviato dall'Istituto Universitario Europeo &egrave; formato da
ricercatori nelle materie economiche, politiche, giuridiche e storiche
provenienti da otto paesi dell'Unione Europea (3 inglesi, 3 irlandesi, 3
spagnoli, 2 italiani, 2 tedeschi, un francese, un olandese, un portoghese).
</P>
<P>
E' significativo il fatto che il governo italiano abbia voluto far ricorso a
giovani &quot;europei&quot; e non solo italiani per la delicata missione nel
paese vicino.

<H1>Conferment of doctorates taken at the European University Institute in
Florence</H1>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
On Friday 27 September, a ceremony will be held for the <B>conferment of
doctorates taken at the European University Institute in Florence</B> by
researchers from all the countries making up the European Union, as well as
associate countries and countries aspiring to join in the next few years. The
ceremony, part of the festivities for the 20th anniversary of the Institute,
will take place at 15.00 in the Badia Fiesolana (S. Domenico di Fiesole). </P>
<P>
This is the first time since the Institute opened in 1976 that the doctorates,
in history, law, economics. and political and social sciences, are to be
conferred in solemn form. The ceremony will be attended by the academic staff,
the Institute's first principal, Max Kohnstamm, and some hundred alumni who
completed their studies in previous years and will be returning for the occasion
to the Badia Fiesolana, the European University Institute's main building.
</P>
<P>
Diplomas will be solemnly handed over by the Institute's current principal, Dr
Patrick Masterson. An Irishman, he is a well-known scholar in philosophy and has
headed the Institute since 1994. Previously, he was president of the University
College of Dublin.
</P>
<P>
With 67 research doctorates (PhDs) awarded last academic year, the European
University Institute has confirmed itself as the institution awarding the
highest number of doctorates in Europe, and perhaps in the world, in the
disciplines of its four departments. The 441 alumni who took their doctorates in
past years include a large number of university teachers in the prominent
universities in Europe and the United States (&Aring;rhus, Barcelona, Bologna,
Cardiff, Hannover, Lisbon, Liverpool, Louvain, Maastricht, Madrid, Milan,
Oporto, Harvard and Princeton), as well as officials of the European Commission
and Council and of the European Court of Justice. Other Institute alumni fill
important posts in the central banks of their countries of origin (the Banca
d'Italia, Banca d'Espa&ntilde;a, Bank of England), in the World Bank and in the
International Monetary Fund, as well as in many multinational concerns. Many
others are in top positions in national public administrations, especially in
the diplomatic service and in non-governmental organizations. Some 25 % of
European University Institute alumni are currently exercising their professions
outside their own countries of origin.

<H1>Conferimento dei dottorati conseguiti all'Istituto Universitario Europeo di
Firenze</H1>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
Venerd&igrave; 27 settembre avr&agrave; luogo la <B>cerimonia per il
conferimento dei dottorati conseguiti all'Istituto Universitario Europeo di
Firenze</B> da ricercatori provenienti da tutti i paesi che compongono l'Unione
Europea ed anche da paesi associati o che aspirano a divenire membri nel corso
dei prossimi anni. La cerimonia, che si svolge nel quadro delle celebrazioni per
il 20&#176; anniversario dell'Istituto, avr&agrave; luogo alle ore 15.00 nella
Badia Fiesolana (S. Domenico di Fiesole).
</P>
<P>
E' la prima volta, dall'inizio dell'attivit&agrave; dell'Istituto nel 1976, che
il conferimento dei dottorati, in storia, giurisprudenza, economia, scienze
politiche e sociali, avviene in forma solenne e nel corso di una cerimonia alla
quale prenderanno parte il corpo accademico, l'ex Presidente dell'Istituto Max
Kohnstamm ed un centinaio di ex ricercatori che hanno terminato i loro studi
negli anni scorsi e si riuniranno per l'occasione alla Badia Fiesolana, sede
principale dell'Istituto Universitario Europeo.
</P>
<P>
I diplomi verranno consegnati dall'attuale Presidente dell'Istituto, l'irlandese
Dr. Patrick Masterson, noto studioso di filosofia ed ex Presidente
dell'University College di Dublino, che &egrave; a capo dell'Istituto dal 1994.
</P>
<P>
Con 67 dottorati di ricerca (PhD) rilasciati nello scorso anno accademico,
l'Istituto Universitario Europeo si &egrave; confermato una delle istituzioni
che rilascia il maggior numero di dottorati in Europa, e forse nel mondo, nelle
materie oggetto di studio dei suoi quattro dipartimenti. Tra i 441 ex
ricercatori che hanno conseguito il dottorato negli anni scorsi vi &egrave; un
gran numero di docenti delle pi&ugrave; note ed accreditate Universit&agrave; in
Europa e negli Stati Uniti (Arhus, Barcellona, Bologna, Cardiff, Hannover,
Lisbona, Liverpool, Louvain, Maastricht, Madrid, Milano, Porto, Harvard e
Princeton) e di funzionari della Commissione Europea, del Consiglio dei Ministri
e della Corte di Giustizia Europea. Ex allievi dell'Istituto occupano importanti
posizioni nelle Banche centrali dei paesi di origine (Banca d'Italia, Banco de
Espa&ntilde;a e Bank of England), nella Banca Mondiale, nel Fondo Monetario
Internazionale, oltre che in numerose imprese multinazionali. Molti hanno infine
incarichi di rilievo nelle varie amministrazioni pubbliche nazionali, in
particolare nel servizio diplomatico, ed in organizzazioni non governative. Il
25% degli ex rixercatori dell'Istituto Universitario Europeo svolge attualmente
la propria attivit&agrave; professionale al di fuori del proprio paese
d'origine.

</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR> 
<P>Through its articles and more general summary of departmental  information
and activities, <EM>The Yearbook of the Department  of History and Civilization</EM>
seeks to convey the essence and  originality of the European University
Institute. Each year, research  students from the member states and other
European countries come  here to prepare their theses under the supervision of
an equally  international professorial staff. The Department of History and 
Civilization attempts to realize the ideal of a university education  which
transcends the frontiers between nations. The constant confrontation  between
different academic and historiographic traditions obliges  each member of this
community to question his assumptions and  to participate, through comparative
encounters, in the construction  of a new European history, anxious to discover
the roots of our  common heritage, but also to trace the special paths which
explain  the differences of political or economic development, customs, 
religious beliefs or behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The Yearbook of the Department of History and Civilization intends  to publish
regularly articles based on the results of doctoral  research centering on one
or two main themes, and also aims to  furnish a summary of the academic
activities within the department. 
</P>
<P>
This publication is for researchers, professors, and students  who are
interested in the most recent developments of the construction  of a European
history. New research students will be able to read  the articles of other young
researchers who have recently completed  their doctoral degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Articles and Departmental News are published in both working languages  of the
Institute: English and French.<BR>

<TITLE>European Clearinghouse for Maps</TITLE>
<P>
<H1>Workshop on Mapping</H1>


On May 13th and 14th, 1994, a workshop on <EM>Coordinates for
Historical Maps</EM> was
held at the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence,
Italy. It has had 25
participants from 14, mainly European, countries, approximately
50% were AHC
members. The aim was to initiate activities for<BR>
<UL>
<LI>an overview of the state of the art in the field of computer
aided
cartography,
<LI>methodological discussion about problems specific to
historical
mapping and
<LI>the creation of an infrastructure for information about
existing
coordinate-data, to improve their availability and exchange.
</UL>
The papers of this meeting are published in a volume of the <A
HREF="cont.html">'Halbgraue Reihe zur historischen
Fachinformatik'</A>.
The first workshop may not have achieved completely all its
objectives, but it is
hoped that it made the first step for ongoing efforts in this
direction.<P>


The contributions had a fairly broad range, thematicly projects
for atlases on U.S. voting (<EM>Kinnear</EM>), Indonesian history
(<EM>Cribb</EM>),
Irish and Portugese agriculture (<EM>Turner and Silveira</EM>),
German and
European transport (<EM>Kunz</EM> and <EM>Carreras et al.</EM>),
European climate
(<EM>Sch&uuml;le</EM>) were presented as well as projects for
databases covering
country wide all administrative units for a certain time period
(the
Netherlands, <EM>Boonstra</EM>, Belgium, <EM>Vanhaute</EM>,
Austria, <EM>Sprengnagel</EM>).
We have had regional and local case studies (Alentejo, Portugal,
<EM>Silveira, Bastos et al.</EM>; Aetolia, Central Greece,
<EM>Doorn</EM>; surrounding
of Genoa, Italy, <EM>Bertelli</EM>; medieval Tuscany,
<EM>Benvenuti and Niccolucci</EM>)
and urban history projects (Leiden, <EM>Diederiks</EM>;
Stockholm,
<EM>Fogelvik</EM>). The methods or the techniques used ranged
from using
graphical software for high quality maps (Canvas - U.S. voting,
CorelDraw - Indonesean history) to the exploitation of a whole
bunch of statistical, database, graphical and geographical
packages
(history of Aetolia, fiscal sources around Genoa, Stockholm and
the
Roteman System), from thematical representation on maps (the
atlas projects) to hypertext based presentation (medieval
Tuscany,
history of Leiden).<P>
Most of the contributions could be characterized as projects
using pragmaticly computer aided cartography for their needs,
only a few used GIS-features in a more strict sense. This
represents most probably the 'average' of historical research
with
computerized maps, but further workshops should perhaps try to
bring together more papers with a stronger GIS approach.<P>
As the first workshop focused on methodologically medium
scaled research, a paper about cost-benefit analysis for
historical
mapping at this level was included (<EM>Baten</EM>). It is
dicussing the
effort of producing maps for simple topics and easy spatial
structure and favours more or less the 'low-tech-low-cost'
approach.
But for more ambitous geographical analysis the scenario most
possibly would differ clearly.<P>

Throughout the whole meeting the question of changing borders
over the time period of interest was virulent, the paper of
<EM>Boonstra</EM>
gives an interesting solution how to cope with it.<P>

The printed volume comes to a close with a paper not presented
at the Firenze meeting, <EM>Gutman and Sample</EM> give an
overview
about digitized sources for the U.S., covering the current U.S.
administrative boundaries. This demonstrates how the requested
'clearing centre for European historical maps'
(<EM>Oldervoll</EM>) could
start: by collecting current computerized map data at the
national
level. Parallel to such an attempt it would be necessary to
collect
information about existing data for historical maps, a first
draft of
a questionaire therefore you find <A
HREF="quest.html">here</A>.<P>

The next meeting of the workshop should focus more on methodics
and the way
of providing maps for exchange, it will be held again at the
EUI.<P>

Miroslav Hroch, graduated from the Charles University in 1956,
where he also took his doctorate in 1962. From 1956 he was teaching
Modern European History at the Institite of General History at
the Charles University Prague. Since 1989 he has a chair as Professor
in General History at the same University. He has been visiting
professor at several Universities in Germany, at UCLA and EUI,
Forum. His main research areas were the Thirty Years War, Baltic
trade and politics in Early Modern History, European revolutions,
Counter-Reformation, Nation-forming processes and national movements
in Europe.<BR>
<P>
This year, his research at EUI will be particularly focused on
two topics:<BR>
<P>
- comparative analysis of the claims and demands of national movements,
especially in Central/East Europe, during the 19th century, i.e.
linguistic and political demands, and the role of the nationally
relevant conflict of interests, as an integrating factor of the
nation-forming process,
<P>
- the role of historical traditions, myths, of &quot;collective
memory&quot; in the 19th-20th centuries, and their relationship
to the scientific historical research: comparing the use of history
as an argument in national and social movements and conflicts.

<TITLE>John Brewer, EUI (HEC)</TITLE>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>JOHN BREWER<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Profile<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
John Brewer is an historian of seventeenth and eighteenth century
Europe and North America whose work has focused primarily on eighteenth&#173;century
Britain. His early work was on the development and dissemination
of political ideologies, studies that concerned both political
theory and the history of printing and publishing. This work was
strongly informed by an interest in the philosophy of action,
and particularly in 'speech acts', as well as by the work of John
Pocock and the Cambridge group of political theorists (notably
Laslett, Skinner and Dunn). In the 1970s and early 1980s he worked
on a number of social history topics, including crime, forms of
public ritual and the history of childhood. Here his methodological
interest derived from social anthropology, notably the work of
Marcel Mauss, Mary Douglas and Victor Turner. While teaching at
Yale in the late 1970s he was involved in the British Art Center,
organising conferences and helping with exhibitions and grant
proposals. From this period dates his interest in literary theory
(of which Yale was a great centre), the history of image&#173;making
and of material culture. During the 1980s his research took two
major directions: on the one hand, the comparative study of the
early modern European state, focusing on its financial and bureaucratic
mechanisms; on the other, a concern with the history of consumption
and with the significance of material culture, whether text, image
or object. The latter topic was the subject of a three year collaborative
research project he organised at the University of California
in Los Angeles. he is currently completing a social and discursive
history of British culture in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
<BR>
<P>
 His research project at the EUI is entitled, &quot;Graphic culture:
images, ideology, power and identity&quot;, and investigates the
markets for different sorts of image, the significance of the
sites at which they could be seen or were displayed, and the nature
of interpretative struggles about the meaning and significance
of images. It is especially concerned with the graphic field as
a means for creating social, political and national forms of distinction
and, though wider in scope, focuses on the different graphic trajectories
of Britain/London&#173;France/Paris. Professor Brewer is developing
a new project, &quot;Unequal Exchange: American Money and European
Art in the late 19th and 20th Centuries&quot;. This is a study
of the role of American patrons, collectors and dealers in the
booming art market from the late nineteenth century and of the
European responses to the movement or loss of cultural patrimony.
It deals not only with the establishment of collections and museums
in North America but with cultural policy and public debate in
Europe.<BR>
<P>
 Professor Brewer has taught British history from the sixteenth
to the twentieth centuries at an undergraduate level. In recent
years his graduate courses have included studies of the history
of consumption and of cultural production in seventeenth and eighteenth&#173;century
Europe; an introduction to sources, methods and problems in modern

<B><FONT SIZE=5>KIRTI N. CHAUDHURI<BR>

</FONT></B>
<P>
K.N. Chaudhuri was educated in England and studied history at
the University of London. His early studies were mainly concerned
with the development of European Economy, foreign trade, and financial
structures in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Subsequently,
he worked on the rise and development of the English East India
Company (1600&#173;1740) for his Ph.D. degree. On being appointed
to a Research Fellowship in Economic History at the University
of London, he continued research on the nineteenth&#173; and twentieth&#173;century
world trade with special reference to the economic relationship
between imperial Britain and India. During this period he also
studied formal methods in economic theory and econometrics at
the London School of Economics.<BR>
<P>
 However, when the India Office Library and Records (the Archives
of the East India Company now administered by the British Library)
opened the original historical accounts books of the Company for
public access, he returned to the theme of the East India Company's
trade with Asia and its interactions with the trading world of
the Indian Ocean. As the statistical data were extremely voluminous,
detailed, and disaggregated, he decided to use a computer for
their processing and analysis. This led him not only to write
specific data&#173;processing programmes in Fortran but also to
the application of econometric techniques to historical analysis.
The mathematical modelling of business decisions and corporate
finance as applied to the East India Company's trade and corporate
strategy was the first of its kind ever attempted in the context
of the Company's history. After some seven years of continuous
research and computer encoding of the data, a complete matrix
of the East India Company's trade and finance was completed in
1975, leading to the construction of complete time series for
the period 1660&#173;1760. The whole research project was guided
on the principle of controlled objectives, parameters, and a strict
limitation of boundaries. The statistical results were combined
with the descriptive historical material and the final conclusions
demonstrate beyond any doubt how far early modern trade and European
corporate business was a function of systematic operational methods
and decision&#173;making on the basis of uncertainty.<BR>
<P>
 After the completion of this period of research, he moved to
a wider analysis of premodern trade, economies, societies, and
the mental perceptions associated with them. Once again, a distinctive
theory and an epistemological approach was developed to deal with
the problem of identifying structures, boundaries, limits, and
perceptions in different civilisations. The methodology was designed
to deal specifically with the problem of comparative history across
the triple dimensions of space, time, and functional relationships.
Although the research aimed to provide a description and an analysis
of societies around the Indian Ocean during the period from the
seventh century to the eighteenth, the application of the theory
is quite general and independent of the actual context. The research
on this project lasted for about twelve years and the results
have been published in two separate volumes.<BR>
<P>
 He is currently working on a fresh analysis of the nature of
European expansion (1500&#173;1800) and its interaction with the
wider world. The questions and problems that are being investigated
include the role of technology, the influence of environment,
the role of objects in structuring society, individuals, and history,
and the relationship between ideas and society. He has just completed
in this connection a two&#173;year project funded by the British
Academy on the early trading towns and cities, structures of early
agrarian production and the management of hydraulic resources.
One of the problems that is being specially investigated in the
context of European expansion is the replication of social structures
over time, as for example, demographic units and family relationships.
<BR>
<P>
 Undergraduate courses taught by K.N. Chaudhuri at the University
of London include economic history of India in the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries, general lectures on the economy and society
in the Indian Ocean in the early modern period as well as more
specialised courses dealing with the history of European expansion,
trade, political development, and social changes. He has also
supervised some twenty&#173;five Ph.D. students who have successfully
defended their thesis on various aspects of economic and social
history.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Profil<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
G&eacute;rard Delille est un historien, sp&eacute;cialiste de
l'Italie des XVe-XIXe si&egrave;cles. Sa formation et ses int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts
se situent dans le courant de &quot;Ecole des Annales&quot;: sa
th&egrave;se de 3e cycle, entreprise en 1968 sous la direction
de F. Braudel et M. Aymard &eacute;tait un travail d'histoire
r&eacute;gionale (la Vall&eacute;e Caudine, en Campanie), s'int&eacute;ressant
aux aspects &eacute;conomiques, sociaux et d&eacute;mographiques
et &agrave; leur &eacute;volution dans le temps long (XVIe-XVIIIe
si&egrave;cles).
<P>
 D&egrave;s le d&eacute;part, l'auteur marque son refus des approches
et des m&eacute;thodologies trop strictement balis&eacute;es,
de la simplification des contextes, de l'isolement des diff&eacute;rents
&eacute;l&eacute;ments du social. L'analyse d&eacute;mographique
s'ouvre largement sur d'autres probl&egrave;mes et tente de substituer
au jeu trop simple des &quot;trois cartes&quot; - nuptialit&eacute;,
f&eacute;condit&eacute;, mortalit&eacute; - l'&eacute;tude des
n&eacute;cessit&eacute;s et des disponibilit&eacute;s de main
d'oeuvre, des migrations int&eacute;rieures, des d&eacute;s&eacute;quilibres
des rapports de sexe, du vieillissement de la population... Ces
orientations et ces m&eacute;thodologies sont confirm&eacute;es
et pr&eacute;cis&eacute;es dans un second livre publi&eacute;
&agrave; Naples en 1977: <I>Agricoltura e demografia nel Regno
di Napoli nei secoli XVIII e XIX</I>. La recherche, fond&eacute;e
sur le d&eacute;pouillement massif de la s&eacute;rie des Etats
des Ames du dioc&egrave;se de Sant'Agata de'Goti, tente de cerner
les relations existant entre les comportements d&eacute;mographiques
fondamentaux et les r&eacute;alit&eacute;s &eacute;conomiques
et sociales profondes de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; prise en consid&eacute;ration.
Cette ouverture probl&egrave;matique en appelait n&eacute;cessairement
d'autres, aussi bien au niveau des th&egrave;mes abord&eacute;s
(la famille, la parent&eacute;, l'alliance, les strat&eacute;gies
et les solidarit&eacute;s de lignages, les rapports de pouvoir,
la constitution des &quot;partis&quot; politiques...) que des
techniques d'analyse (appel &agrave; une probl&eacute;matique
de type anthropologique dont G. Delille ne cache pas, par ailleurs,
les limites et les difficult&eacute;s d'application &agrave; l'histoire).
C'est sur ces bases qu'il entreprend son travail de recherche
dans le cadre d'une th&egrave;se d'Etat. Cette derni&egrave;re,
soutenue en 1982 et publi&eacute;e en 1985, a suscit&eacute; un
large d&eacute;bat et fait l'objet de nombreux comptes rendus,
en Italie, en France mais aussi en Grande Bretagne et aux Etats
Unis.
<P>
 Tout en mettant l'accent sur le r&ocirc;le de la famille, de
la parent&eacute; et de l'alliance, consid&eacute;r&eacute;es
sous leurs aspects d&eacute;mographiques, &quot;politiques&quot;
et anthropologiques (m&eacute;canismes de r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;,
figures remarquables de l'alliance, bouclages consanguins...),
ce travail montrait aussi, dans un cadre qui au d&eacute;part,
semblait plutot unitaire, la diversit&eacute; des comportements
r&eacute;gionaux (la Campanie fortement patrilin&eacute;aire,
les Pouilles caract&eacute;ris&eacute;es par une nette infl&eacute;xion
matrilin&eacute;aire) et ne d&eacute;bouchait pas sur la description
d'un syst&egrave;me g&eacute;n&eacute;ral.
<P>
 Toujours r&eacute;fugi&eacute; derri&egrave;re le connu et l'observ&eacute;,
G. Delille a mobilis&eacute;, pour ses recherches, des sources
importantes et jusqu'alors peu exploit&eacute;es. De l'&eacute;norme
fonds des Etats des Ames du Dioc&egrave;se de Salerne au <I>Libro
Magno delle Famiglie di Manduria</I>, il ne s'est pas content&eacute;
de montrer la richesse, pour les historiens, des Archives italiennes;
fid&egrave;le &agrave; la le&ccedil;on de M. Bloch, il a toujours
cherch&eacute;, pour mieux comprendre la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
qu'il &eacute;tudiait, &agrave; &quot;construire&quot; les documents
dont il avait besoin.
<P>
 Le &quot;projet Manduria&quot; qu'il dirige depuis 1986, en collaboration
entre l'Ecole Fran&ccedil;aise de Rome et le Laboratoire d'Anthropologie
sociale du Coll&egrave;ge de France propose, &agrave; partir d'un
r&eacute;seau g&eacute;n&eacute;alogique de base, pr&eacute;cis
et couvrant pr&egrave;s de 5 si&egrave;cles, une accumulation
et une interconnexion continue de donn&eacute;es tir&eacute;es
de sources multiples (notariales, judiciaires, priv&eacute;es,
eccl&eacute;siastiques, mais aussi m&eacute;dicales...) pour permettre
non seulement de multiplier les questions et les possibilit&eacute;s
de r&eacute;ponses, mais aussi, de faire &eacute;clater les d&eacute;finitions
des sujets, l'individualisation des probl&egrave;mes - d&eacute;riv&eacute;
trop souvent d'un bilan d'autres travaux - et les techniques d'investigation.
Chaque ensemble de donn&eacute;es nouvelles s'int&eacute;gre aux
pr&eacute;c&eacute;dents et les modifie, multipliant constamment
les perspectives m&eacute;thodologiques et probl&egrave;matiques.
<P>
 Le projet s'est d&eacute;velopp&eacute;, jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent
suivant 4 directions fondamentales: &eacute;tudes des m&eacute;canismes
de l'alliance, &eacute;tude du personnel eccl&eacute;siastique,
&eacute;tude du pouvoir local et une &eacute;tude de g&eacute;n&eacute;tique
humaine, sur la thalass&eacute;mie (avec les h&ocirc;pitaux de
Manduria et de Cr&eacute;teil). D'autres directions de recherche
devront &ecirc;tre engag&eacute;es par la suite, en particuliers
sur les circuits financiers et sur l'emploi des langages administratifs.
<P>
 A tous ces niveaux, les &eacute;changes m&eacute;thodologiques
et probl&egrave;matiques avec l'anthropologie sont constants et
se veulent r&eacute;ciproques. Il n'y a pas placage de r&eacute;alit&eacute;s
et de concepts sur d'autres r&eacute;alit&eacute;s et d'autres
concepts et la rencontre des deux disciplines pose probl&egrave;me
aux uns et aux autres: aux historiens qui ne peuvent plus se retrancher
derri&egrave;re la barri&egrave;re de la diversit&eacute;, aux
anthropologues qui ne peuvent ignorer qu'aucune des d&eacute;finitions
&eacute;labor&eacute;es sur le terrain ne s'ins&egrave;re compl&eacute;tement
dans le devenir historique.
<P>
 Son projet de recherche actuel, &quot;le politique et la d&eacute;finition
des groupes&quot;, voudrait tenter d'analyser, dans une optique
comparative, pour les XVIe-XVIIe si&egrave;cles, les rapports
entre les multiples facteurs &eacute;conomiques, sociaux, familiaux,
culturels, religieux, symboliques et rituels qui d&eacute;terminent
de mani&egrave;re plus ou moins pr&eacute;cise et mouvante les
&quot;fronti&egrave;res&quot; d'un &quot;groupe&quot;, et le politique
comme acteur et moyen d'une modification plus radicale de ces
fronti&egrave;res et des langages qui les expriment. Au del&agrave;
de l'image toujours tr&egrave;s pr&eacute;gnante de l'Etat L&eacute;viathan,
construction rationnelle et volontariste qui impose ses formes
et ses modalit&eacute;s de pouvoir, on cherchera &agrave; mettre
en lumi&egrave;re la dialectique profonde entre affirmation de
&quot;l'Etat moderne&quot; et remodellement des groupes sociaux
(<I>ceti</I> et syst&egrave;mes censitaires d'acc&egrave;s aux
charges, v&eacute;nalit&eacute; des offices, factions et client&egrave;les
politiques, gestion de l'appareil judiciaire...). Cette recherche
fera largement appel, &agrave; travers une analyse de type anthropologique,
&agrave; des sources narratives (correspondances d'administrateurs,
r&eacute;cits de d&eacute;bats et de combats politiques...).<BR>

Ma th&egrave;se a port&eacute; sur l'analyse des ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes
migratoires dans les Alpes dauphinoises au XIXe si&egrave;cles
avec le but de comprendre comment les diverses formes de migration,
et en particulier la migration temporaire des colporteurs s'articulaient
&agrave; la soci&eacute;t&eacute; villageoise &eacute;conomiquement
et socialement et comment pouvait s'expliquer le passage des migrations
traditionnelles aux d&eacute;parts massifs de la seconde partie
du XIXe si&egrave;cle.  Cette recherche s'est ensuite d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e
dans trois directions diff&eacute;rentes. 
<P>
1) Travailler entre XVIIe et XIXe si&egrave;cle sur l'organisation
sociale, politique et &eacute;conomique des communaut&eacute;s
vivant de mani&egrave;re structurelle de la migration et, plus
g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement, comprendre les implications de l'organisation
sociale en parent&eacute;s et en client&egrave;les tant sur la
reproduction des familles, que sur les relations avec l'Etat et
sur les mani&egrave;res dont les individus g&egrave;rent leurs
diverses appartenances, vivent et construisent des identit&eacute;s
sociales.  
<P>
2) Tester, &agrave; l'&eacute;chelle de l'Europe, le mod&egrave;le
d'&eacute;volution des migrations marchandes montagnardes mis
au point dans les Alpes du Haut Dauphin&eacute; entre XVe et XIXe
si&egrave;cle et comprendre le succ&egrave;s &eacute;conomique
et le d&eacute;clin de l'organisation en r&eacute;seaux de ces
populations de marchands colporteurs.
<P>
3) L'importance des relations de cr&eacute;dit s'&eacute;tait
r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute;e centrale dans l'analyse de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
villageoise et, &agrave; travers les m&eacute;tiers de la migration
et le r&ocirc;le des &eacute;lites locales et r&eacute;gionales,
ces relations de cr&eacute;dit ins&egrave;rent les villageois
dans les &eacute;conomies des villes et des campagnes. Je travaille
actuellement &agrave; comprendre les relations de cr&eacute;dit
en Europe, entre XVIe et XIXe si&egrave;cles, en les envisageant
comme un ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne autant social et politique qu'&eacute;conomique.
<P>
Mon projet de recherche actuel &quot;les liens de la dette : institutions
et pratiques sociales du cr&eacute;dit en Europe entre XVIe et
XIXe si&egrave;cles&quot; voudrait comprendre comment fonctionnent
ces pratiques de cr&eacute;dit &agrave; la fois universelles et
hautement particularis&eacute;es, selon les r&eacute;gions d'Europe,
les groupes sociaux, et les motifs qui poussent &agrave; l'endettement
; ce qu'elles signifient socialement et culturellement et comment
elles s'articulent entre elles. Cette recherche se place dans
les travaux des sociologues et des &eacute;conomistes qui, de
Max Weber &agrave; Douglass North, mettent l'accent sur l'importance
de l'institutionnalisation de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; dans sa
conqu&ecirc;te de la modernit&eacute;.  Il s'agit, en historienne,
regarder de plus pr&egrave;s ces grandes analyses de la modernit&eacute;
en partant de la complexit&eacute; sociale, politique, institutionnelle,
&eacute;conomique et culturelle de l'Europe.<BR>

<P>
Professor Hufton is a socio&#173;cultural historian whose earliest
publications were concerned with the impact of the French Revolution
upon the lives of different social groups in a small town. She
then became particularly interested in reconstructing the lives
of the poor in eighteenth century France and in the interaction
between poverty and criminality. From a study of France, she adopted
a comparative approach and an interest in popular mentalities,
particularly attitudes towards authority, riot, violence and criminality,
and she was soon drawn into the developing study of women in the
family, the workplace, the lawcourt and the community. Recently,
she has examined the impact of the Revolution upon the lives of
women and has recently published an award-winning volume on women's
experiences in western Europe 1500-1800 to be shortly followed
by a second volume 1800-2000. Whilst at Harvard, she developed
an interest in identity formation and in the complex interaction
between what is perceived as the norm and what actually was real
life experience. She is concerned to integrate gender along with
age, class and sex as a major tool for the social analysis of
European society in both the pre industrial and the industrial
periods. The history of poverty, assistance and of fund raising
for charitable initiatives, policing and crime control are also
among her specialised interests.<BR>
<P>
 In the UK, Professor Hufton's undergraduate teaching was in European
social and economic history from the 17th to the 19th centuries
and she gave more specialised courses on the history of the French
Revolution, on Crime in Early Modern Europe and on the History
of Women from 1600&#173;1914. At Harvard, she taught as an undergraduate
field the history of western feminism in its social context 1789&#173;1980
and the socio&#173;cultural history of 18th and 19th century France
and ran a graduate seminar on the sources and methods of writing
gender history. She also chaired a post doctoral study group on
women in modern Europe at the Minda de G&uuml;nzburg Center for
European Studies. In 1995-6 she was a co-director of the European
Forum &quot;Gender and the use of Time&quot;.<BR>

<P>
Ren&eacute; Leboutte travaille principalement dans le domaine
de l'histoire &eacute;conomique et sociale du 19e si&egrave;cle.
Son champ de recherches couvre l'histoire des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s
industrialis&eacute;es europ&eacute;ennes et son projet de recherches
comprend quatre centres d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t.
<P>
Le premier porte sur la gen&egrave;se et les mutations des bassins
industriels depuis la r&eacute;volution industrielle jusqu'&agrave;
l'aube des ann&eacute;es 1980. Cette &eacute;tude, men&eacute;e
suivant les m&eacute;thodes de l'histoire compar&eacute;e, envisage
non seulement l'histoire &eacute;conomique et la g&eacute;ographie
industrielle (probl&egrave;mes de localisation, de formation des
r&eacute;gions &eacute;conomiques), mais aussi l'urbanisation
et l'histoire sociale.
<P>
Le deuxi&egrave;me centre d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t comprend la d&eacute;mographie
historique, particuli&egrave;rement les questions relatives &agrave;
la transition d&eacute;mographique, &agrave; la structure et &agrave;
la dynamique des m&eacute;nages, aux maladies professionnelles
et aux accidents du travail et &agrave; tout ce qui touche aux
mouvements migratoires (recrutement de la main-d'oeuvre, formation
de minorit&eacute;s, int&eacute;gration, etc.)
<P>
La culture populaire en milieu ouvrier, les conditions de vie
et de travail (salaire, niveau de vie, logement...) forment le
troisi&egrave;me centre d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t.
<P>
Enfin R. Leboutte s'est sp&eacute;cialis&eacute; dans l'histoire
des techniques, sp&eacute;cialement dans les domaines de la m&eacute;tallurgie,
de l'exploitation des mines, de verrerie, de l'industrie laini&egrave;re.

</FONT></B>
<P>
Alan Milward studied history at University College London and
economic history at the London School of Economics. After a brief
spell as an archaeologist he returned to economic history, which
he taught for five years in the University of Edinburgh and for
a year in the University of East Anglia, before leaving for a
chair in Economics at Stanford University. After three years at
Stanford he accepted an interdisciplinary chair in the University
of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, teaching economics,
economic history and political science there for twelve years.
He became Professor of Contemporary History in the European University
Institute in 1983 eventually leaving to take up the post of Professor
of Economic History at the London School of Economics and Political
Science.
<P>
 His first books were studies of economies and societies during
the Second World War, and the links between war and economic and
social change throughout history remain a central interest. He
has published and taught throughout his career in the whole area
of nineteenth century European economic development, with a particular
interest in the international economy. Over the last fifteen years
however he has become best known for his studies of the links
between post-war west European economic and political developments
and the history, economics, and politics of the European Communities.
His research interests and projects in the Institute are concentrated
on that last interest and he is in charge of the Institute's permanent
research project on the History of European Integration. In particular
he studies the factors which have contributed to patterns of group
and individual allegiance to nations and to the Community.
<P>
 He has taught as visiting professor in several countries, Denmark,
France, Germany, Norway and the USA, and has been elected a fellow
of the Royal Norwegian Academy of Arts and Sciences as well as
of the British Academy. He holds an honorary Master's degreee
from the University of Manchester. His first and most fundamental
interest remains in historical research and in the utilisation
of all possible sources for research and of all possible approaches
to it. His concern, however, is also that historical research
should be of the widest possible use to society as a whole and,
in the case of contemporary history, provide some help in understanding
current and future trends of economic, social and political development.

Luisa Passerini's researches have followed some major themes as
connecting threads through various fields. A first one is the
study of the subjects of social and cultural change, from the
African liberation movements to the movements of workers, students,
women in our century. A second one is memory, especially oral,
on the basis of interviews and testimonies, that has allowed her
to study the history of Fascism under a new perspective as well
as to investigate problems of methodology of history and of relationships
between history and the social sciences. In the field of methodology
she has given particular attention to the links between sources,
objects and methods, and to the interpretation of sources for
a history of subjectivity.<BR>
<P>
 She is currently working on a project about the relationships
between Europeanness and the idea of romantic love. From the end
of the XVIII century this connection has been developed, on the
basis of the claim that a uniquely European way of loving exists
and that it has something to do with a specially high status of
women in Europe. The research deals with the extension and characteristics
of this mythology, between the two poles of the specialized field
of Romance philology and of general opinion among intellectual
&eacute;lites, using sources of various kinds, such as essays
(from literature on European federalism to literary histories),
novels, personal letters.<BR>
<P>
 Her teaching has included the following topics: 
&quot;Communication in history: orality, writing and image&quot;;
&quot;1968: Dimensions in Time and Space&quot;; 
&quot;History, Memory, Identities in XX century Europe&quot;;
&quot;European Identity? A Cultural-Historical Approach&quot;;

<P>
Jaime Reis' earlier research interest concentrated on Brazilian
and Latin American social and economic history. It focused on
the sugar plantation economies of the tropical belt, with special
emphasis on the transition from slave to free labour systems.
He published several papers in this field, mostly with a comparative
and quantitative content, before moving on to the study of 19th
and 20th century European economic history, where his interest
has been centred on Portugal. The earlier concern with the quantitative
and comparative dimensions has been kept but the thematic scope
has broadened considerably. He engaged first of all in the study
of the agricultural sector, with a stress on the entrepreneurial
behaviour of southern latifundiary landlords and farmers, as well
as on the relationship between politics and economics as seen
through the rise of agricultural protectionism in the late eighteen
hundreds. Industrial development in a 'late-comer' peripheral
economy such as this one followed, with a project being developed
in order to generate industrial production indices for the 19th
century, the first such effort attempted for Portugal and which
is currently being extended to the whole economy since the 1840s.
Since human capital deficiencies loomed large in the explanation
found for the low productivity and competitiveness of Portuguese
manufacturing by international standards, an effort was made in
this direction too. This involved gauging the country's 'educational
deficit' and providing a political and institutional interpretation
for the low investment in schooling by comparison with similar
late-comers, particularly those of the so-called Latin periphery.
More recently, an opportunity arose to establish a major research
project on Portuguese financial history in connection with the
preparation of a history of the central bank. This has led to
work on the quantification of the money supply, studies on the
gold standard, an overall account of the banking system up to
World War II and, of course, the history of the Bank of Portugal,
now nearing completion. Throughout these fifteen years, however,
the backdrop to these various fields of enquiry has been the issue
of Portugal's long run economic backwardness and a constant effort
to draw lines of comparison with both similar and contrasting
performances in other parts of the Continent, since the mid 19th
to the mid 20th centuries. Hence, the intention of pursuing, at
the EUI, a more widely encompassing approach to these issues which
broadens the comparative scope to Scandinavia and 'Mediterranean
Europe' and looks at basic conditions of long term economic performance
such as human capital, institutions and financial systems. Hence
also the current participation in a project to compile a new series
of National Accounts for Portugal since the 1840's.<BR>
<P>
 Professor Reis has taught undergraduate courses on Latin American
and Brazilian history, as well as on the economic history of plantation
societies and of the Third World. At this level, he has also taught
British and European 19th and 20th century economic history. He
has participated in several MA programmes where he has taught
European economic development in the long run and courses on quantitative
methods for economic historians. he has directed Ph.D. theses
on a variety of topics both in Latin America and Portuguese economic
history.<BR>

<P>
R. Romanelli's research concerns the social and political history
of institutions in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
<P>
 He obtained his M.A. in Political Science at the University of
Rome, where he studied History, Economy and Law. He was interested
in the problems of the construction of the Italian nation-state,
working primarily on the topics of self-government and the central
authorities, bureaucracies, and electoral representation. His
interest in the field of social history mainly concerns the history
of the &eacute;lites and the middle classes. While at the University
of Pisa, he directed a working group about the bourgeoisie in
the 19th Century and carried out a research about the Florentine
wealthier &eacute;lites in the second half of the 19th Century.
He also works in the field of the history of the aristocracy and
the institutional history of the family.
<P>
 At the EUI he is currently directing a research project on the
history of electoral mechanisms in the evolution of the European
representative systems from the end of the 18th century to the
first half of the 20th century. The research combines the theoretical
approach of the theory of representation with the history of the
positive norms (laws and practices regarding elections) in the
electoral process as a whole, from the formation of the electoral
roles and candidatures to the elections themselves.<BR>

<TITLE>Postgraduate Programme in Economics</TITLE>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">

<H2></H2> 
<P>
<B>Note: The following is taken from the 1996/97 Postgraduate Programme Booklet
which is revised each year by the Economics Department and is now in the process
of revision. Therefore please be aware that some procedures, rules and course
details will be changed in the next few months.</B>
</P>
<H3><A NAME="a_organization"></A>A. Organization of Studies
</H3> 
<H4>1. <A NAME="the_phd"></A>The PhD in Economics: Objectives and Principles</H4>
<P>
The Economics Department aims to provide its students with a thorough training
in the areas of economics and econometrics which are essential in order for them
to follow successful academic or professional careers in leading universities or
other research oriented organizations. In addition to training in basic
economics and econometrics the Economics Department faculty provide guidance in
research methods and advise students on the preparation of their dissertations.
</P>
<P>
The programme of study in the Economics Department is the three year PhD
programme, although many students complete their PhD thesis in their fourth
year. The programme is one of the largest (if not the largest) PhD programmes in
Europe. For example in 1995 twenty theses were defended. Most graduating
students subsequently follow an academic career or work for international
organizations although some work in the private sector. Within the programme,
students follow courses (mostly in their first and part of the second year)
develop their own research with the direct supervision of an advisor, and
participate in other general research activities of the Department -workshops,
seminars, etc. In addition, students interested can take advantage of other
activities of the EUI, for example participating in seminars in other
Departments, the Schuman Centre or the European Forum. Students may also take
advantage of a wide range of language courses offered by the Institute's
Language Centre.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the courses is to provide the student with the adequate training and
knowledge needed to carry on research and make contributions in some field of
economics. There are some basic graduate courses in microeconomics,
macroeconomics and econometrics that students take in their first year. Students
with a sufficient previous background may be exempted from taking these courses
by successfully passing an exam. In addition to these basic courses, the
Department also offers a wide range of advanced graduate courses oriented to
provide specialization and a more complete graduate training (a description of
this year's courses follows).
</P>
<P>
In addition to successfully completing the course-work, the students must
develop a number of independent research activities. In the first year -mostly,
in the third term- the students must complete a first paper which should form
the basis of some of their subsequent research (see the description of the &quot;June
paper&quot; below). In the second year, the students must present an original
piece of research (Second Year Students' Workshop) and regularly attend a
specialist subject area workshop. In the third year the students must present a
version of a paper, to be included in the PhD thesis, in one of the Department's
Research Workshops. These activities, together with the successful completion of
the PhD thesis, aim to provide a solid research experience. An advisor, and
possibly other faculty members, supervises the student's research progress.
Advisors are assigned to students before they undertake the first year paper
(see June Paper), although it is possible to change supervisors with the consent
of the Director of Graduate Studies at the beginning of the second year.
</P>
<P>
An acceptable PhD thesis should contain a contribution to knowledge taking one
of the following forms:
</P>
<P>
(a) an extended paper providing the basis of a book or monograph of publishable
standard on a topic in economics and/or econometrics;
</P>
<P>
(b) a series of papers of which at least two could provide the basis of papers
that would justify publication in refereed economics and/or econometrics
journals.
</P>
<P>
Joint research may form part of a PhD thesis provided that the thesis contains a
clear statement of which parts are the results of joint research, and of the
relative contributions of the co-authors.
</P>
<P>
The responsibility for the day-to-day running of the Postgraduate Programme in
Economics lies with the Director of Graduate Studies who is appointed from among
the professors in the Department. One member of the faculty is also specifically
appointed to manage the first year taught programme and acts as the First Year
Coordinator.
</P>
<P>
The following sections provide more detailed information about the structure of
the current 1995-96 programme. Some changes may be incorporated for the next
academic year (1996-97) in order to strengthen the basic structure of courses
and to avoid excessive concentration of courses in the first two terms of the
first year. Any modification from the current programme will be announced before
the end of May 1996. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the regular course schedule, the Department has a number of
workshops and seminars offered by visiting faculty, Department faculty members
and graduate students. In a regular week, there is a departmental seminar and
workshops in Econometrics, Macroeconomics and Microeconomics. In addition there
are usually seminars on European issues organized jointly with the Schuman
Centre. In 1996/97 there will be a European Forum (organized by Michael Artis
and Ramon Marimon) on the Political Economy of an Integrated Europe which will
host a number of international scholars of economics and political science who
will visit the Institute for extended periods of time. The Institute will also
hold several conferences within the context of the European Forum. The Institute
hosts each year the Summer School of the European Economic Association which in
1996 will take place in September. The 1996 topic is Computational Methods to
Study Dynamic Economies. Information about this and other activities can always
be obtained by accessing the Department's World Wide Web Home Page. The address
is <A HREF="http://www.iue.it/ECO/Welcome.html">http://www.iue.it/ECO/Welcome.html</A>.
</P>
<H4>2. Organization of the First-Year Programme</H4> 
<P>
The first year begins with a Research Techniques Course which starts in
September, and is followed by two terms of taught courses. However, it is
emphasized that a good knowledge of mathematics and statistics is required for
entry into the Economics Department Programme. In both of the two terms all
students are required to follow and be examined in four courses (unless an
exemption has been obtained - see below), some of which are compulsory. The
language of instruction is English.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="first_term_compulsory"></A>First Term - Compulsory Courses

<P>
<STRONG>Techniques for Mathematical Economics and Econometrics - </STRONG>
</P>
<P>
<EM>Background Course</EM>
</P>
<P>
This course starts in the middle of September and runs throughout the whole of
the first term. The course covers mathematical and statistical techniques used
in research in economics and econometrics, and provides an introduction to the
computing facilities at the EUI. This course is graded on a pass-fail basis,
with grades recorded on students' transcripts and taken into account by the
Examination Committee when it makes recommendations as to whether students
should be allowed to proceed to the second year of study.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Research Techniques Course all students are required to take
<I>three</I> compulsory courses plus <I>one</I> course chosen from the list of
options. The menu of options may be changed from year to year to reflect the
availability of teaching staff and changes in their interests and expertise.
Offered options may also be withdrawn if there is insufficient enrolment.

</P>
<P>
e) With the advice and consent of his or her advisor, a student may seek
permission from the Director of Graduate Studies to follow a course in another
department as an optional course. Before such permission can be given
arrangements must be made for the instructor of the course to provide an
assessment of the student's performance to the Department of Economics.
</P>
<P>
Students are required to indicate their choice of courses (which should be
cleared with their advisor) to the Departmental Assistant (<A
HREF="mailto:bourgon@datacomm.iue.it">Mrs. Bourgonje</A>) no later than the end
of the first week of classes.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="exemptions"></A>Exemptions</H4>  
<P>
Students may apply for exemption from any or all of the four compulsory courses.
In no case will exemption from compulsory courses be granted except by
examination. Such examinations will ordinarily take place before the end of
September. Information on the date, the level (e.g. which textbook) and the
content (e.g. which chapters) will be provided, together with the letter of
acceptance from the EUI. The level is such that students with different
backgrounds, but a basic training in the field, have a fair chance of passing.
However, this does not exclude topics of special interest to the teacher of the
required course, treated at a basic level (the level of an introductory PhD
course). The grade for the exam will be used in calculating the final grade
point average at the end of the year. If a low passing grade is obtained, a
student may still decide to take the course and the final exam to obtain a
better grade.
</P>
<P>
Students who have qualified for exemption from one or more compulsory courses
may then proceed to develop their research in collaboration with their advisor.
They will also be expected to participate in the subject area research workshop
which lies closest to their interests.

</P>
<P>
j) With the advice and consent of his or her advisor, a student may seek
permission from the Director of Graduate Studies to follow a course in another
department as an optional course. Before such permission can be given
arrangements must be made for the instructor of the course to provide an
assessment of the student's performance to the Department of Economics.
</P>
<P>
k) Reading Course. Exceptionally, a student who, (i) has obtained high grades in
the first term examinations, and (ii) wishes to study a topic or topics not
covered in any of the taught courses, but for which there is at least one
faculty member competent and willing to supervise a reading course may, with the
consent of his/her advisor, submit a written proposal to the Director of
Graduate Studies for approval. If the proposal is approved, the student should
submit a written report on the material read and analyzed, for examination by
the faculty member providing supervision for the reading course by the end of
the second term examination week.
</P>
<H4>3. <A NAME="june_paper"></A>The June Paper
</H4> 
<P>
A requirement for completion of the first-year programme is submission, by the
end of the first week of June, of a paper which will be examined by the
student's advisor and another reader selected by the Economics Department. The
June paper should contain the following elements:
</P>
<P>
a) A clear statement of the specific questions which the student intends to
tackle in the proposed PhD dissertation. It is NOT sufficient to indicate and
describe the general area of inquiry (e.g. the operation of the EEC Common
Agricultural Policy). It is necessary to formulate specific questions which will
be addressed (e.g. what is the redistributive impact of EEC Common Agricultural
Policy on member states, taking into account trade diversion as well as direct
costs and benefits?). A clear statement of the ways in which the questions
considered in the proposed dissertation are to be investigated (e.g. theoretical
and/or empirical analysis, chosen methodology, and sources).
</P>
<P>
b) A brief literature review to ensure that the student is aware of the relevant
literature.
</P>
<P>
c) The June Paper should also contain some of the student's own preliminary
research on the proposed topic.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the June paper will contain a clear and articulate statement
of the questions or problems to be analyzed, of the conjectures to be
considered, of the relevant existing literature, and of the approach to be
adopted. In the case of empirical analysis the nature and sources of data should
be described, and an indication given of which econometric/statistical software
is to be used.
</P>
<P>
Four typewritten copies of the June Paper should be submitted to the
Departmental Assistant on or before 4 p.m. of the first Friday in June.
</P>
<P>
The paper should be written in English, except by prior approval of the advisor
and the Director of Graduate Studies, and must not exceed 25 pages. In addition,
the June paper must not consist of material presented elsewhere for examination
or for the assessment of an optional course.
</P>
<H4>4. <A NAME="admission_second"></A>Admission to the Second Year
</H4> 
<P>
Admission to the second year is based on the student's performance in the first
year courses and in the June paper and is decided by an Examination Committee
which includes all the faculty involved in the teaching of the first year
courses. Specific rules are described in a separate booklet which will be
distributed to the incoming students at the beginning of their first year.
</P>
<H4>5. <A NAME="the_second_and"></A>The Second and Third Years
</H4> 
<P>
Students who have been admitted to the second year of the PhD programme begin
the preparation of their thesis under the supervision of a member of the
Economics Department, though additional supervision is possible from an external
supervisor, or from a co-supervisor within the Economics Department or one of
the other departments at the EUI. Second year students are required to attend
and present a paper based on their research to the Student Workshop and are
required to participate in their subject area workshop. Students beyond the
second year are expected to attend this workshop, and are required to present at
least one paper per year to one of the Economics Department's specialized
research workshops. At the end of each student's second year the Examination
Committee, consisting of the faculty of the Department of Economics plus any
external supervisors or co-supervisors, will assess whether or not to recommend
to the Admissions Committee that the student be admitted to the third year of
the PhD programme. The recommendation will be based on the student's performance
in the Student Workshop and on the report of the supervisor(s).
</P>
<P>
At the end of the third, and each subsequent year, the Examination Committee,
consisting of the faculty of the Economics Department plus any external
supervisors or co-supervisors, will assess (based on a recommendation from the
supervisor(s)) whether or not each continuing student is making adequate
progress towards completion of the dissertation to justify the award of student
status.
</P>
<P>
The summer months provide an opportunity for students to continue their research
either at the EUI, in their home country, or in another location which provides
suitable facilities. All students are required to discuss their summer schedule
of work with their supervisor(s), and if for some reason they are unable to
continue their studies during the summer months they should apply to have their
EUI registration suspended in order to preserve their grant to provide financial
support during the period in which they are completing their PhD theses.
</P>
<H4>6. <A NAME="the_ma"></A>The M.A. in Economics
</H4> 
<P>
Students admitted to the PhD programme may, after successfully completing the
first year of study, apply for an M.A. on the following conditions. The award of
the M.A. degree is separate from admission to the second year. All students,
whether admitted to the second year or not, may apply for an M.A.
</P>
<P>
Students who apply for an M.A. are required to submit a thesis which, in
addition to the requirements for the June paper, as given in Section 3 above,
should provide analytical and/or empirical answers to a well-defined problem. In
other words, the M.A. thesis should be a self-contained piece of research.
Students admitted to the second year of the PhD Programme can submit it in
September (normally as a revised June paper) or at any time prior to the
submission of their PhD thesis for examination. Students not admitted to the
second year and applying for an M.A., must submit the M.A. thesis no later than
the end of the September in the year following their completion of the first
year programme.
</P>
<P>
The M.A. thesis should be submitted in four typewritten copies. The thesis
should be written in English, except by prior approval of the supervisor and the
Director of Graduate Studies, and should not exceed 50 pages.
</P>
<P>
The Director of Graduate Studies on receipt of an M.A. dissertation will appoint
examiners, usually drawn from the faculty of the Economics Department. The
examiners are required to submit their reports and recommendations within two
months of receiving the M.A. thesis. The Examination Committee, consisting of
the faculty of the Economics Department plus any other examiners of the M.A.
dissertation, will assess whether or not to award the M.A. The Examination
Committee will meet in the absence of students and student representatives to
reach recommendations on the award of the M.A. The recommendation will be based
on the student's performance in first-year courses and on the reports of the
M.A. thesis examiners.
</P>
<P>
In the event that the Examination Committee reaches a negative final
recommendation on the award of the M.A., the student concerned may apply to the
Examination Committee for an opportunity to revise the M.A. thesis. Finally, it
is important to draw to the attention of all students that the material
contained in an M.A. thesis cannot form a substantive part of a PhD thesis
without considerable revision. If the material from an M.A. thesis, in an
essentially unrevised form, is included in a PhD thesis, then the examiners must
be informed of this and not take it into account in assessing the suitability of
the PhD thesis for the award of that degree.

<A NAME="game"></A>Game Theory (James Dow)
</P>
<P>
This course is a ten-week introduction to Game Theory. It is designed as a
foundation for applying and understanding game-theoretic methods in general
economic applications. Although it is designed primarily with applications in
mind, the game-theoretic content of the course is maximized by not considering
applications explicitly.
</P>
<P>
The course is based closely on the Osborne-Rubinstein text. Some further reading
is recommended, but not required. I suggest looking at related material in the
two recommended texts (Binmore and Fudenberg-Tirole), at the related articles in
the <EM>New Palgrave</EM>, or at the references given in OR. Gibbons is a good,
lower level introductory textbook.

THE THEORY OF COMPETITIVE EQUILIBRIUM
</P>
<P>
This is a ten-week course on the competitive equilibrium model; it is pretty
much self-contained, with many handouts on background material and technical
results. The core of the course is devoted to the basic issues of existence,
optimality and determinacy in the classical Walrasian model. To the extent that
time permits, the focus then shifts to allocation over time and under
uncertainty and, more specifically, on the role of financial markets in
providing saving/insurance options. 
</P>
<P>
Most of what one really learns comes from doing problem sets, and these are
given on a weekly basis. So, in addition to the regular lecture, there is also a
weekly problem/review session, in which the problem sets are discussed (and in
which I also expand on the various technical results needed for the course
proper, e.g., nonlinear programming, or the analysis of smooth equations).
</P>
<P>
There are a number of texts and treatises which elaborate the theory of
competitive equilibrium. Though the course is not be based on any particular one
of these developments, one will likely find it useful to peruse some of them.

<P>
The aim of this course is to study macroeconomic policies in the context of
intertemporal micro/macro economic models. We will study fiscal and monetary
policies in the context of different intertemporal equilibrium models. There is
no textbook, although [9] will be used for several topics. The main references,
together with the material covered in class, form the core of the course, which
is intended to be self contained. I also provide additional references for
whoever is interested in following up a particular topic.
</P>
<P>
There will be exercises and most weeks there will be a special problem/review
session. Final grade will reflect performance in the final exam, a mid-term
quiz, and exercises (together with participation in review sessions) (approx.:

ASPECTS OF ECONOMETRIC INFERENCE IN NONLINEAR MODELS: 
</P>
<P>
This course will be designed as a second/third year advanced option but will be
accessible to those in the first year who have a sufficiently strong econometric
background. Anyone from the first year who wishes to take this course must
discuss it with me beforehand. We will start by developing some tools of
differential geometry for statistical and econometric analysis and then explore
three issues in particular: the impact of statistical curvature on inference,
the question of parameterisation and the geometric analysis of linear time
series models.

This is a taught course on <EM>Game-Theoretic Contributions to Competition
Policy</EM>. I am putting together what I see as the main contributions of
applied game theory, over the last two decades, to a better understanding of how
collusion works and what antitrust authorities should do - and can do - about
it.
</P>
<P>
I shall be using selected chapters from my book <EM>Competition Policy: A
Game-Theoretic Perspective</EM>, (Cambridge University Press, 1995). These
chapters will be discussed in class. They are to be read in advance. They give
all relevant references.
</P>
<P>
The first class will be devoted to <U>Preliminaries</U> (Chapter 1). The next 2
weeks will be on <U>Explicit Collusion</U>: the basic paper by Selten on why
four are few and six are many (Chapter 2) and cartel enforcement with imperfect
and incomplete information (Chapter 4).
</P>
<P>
The main problem in competition policy is how to define and how to detect <U>Tacit
Collusion</U>. We shall discuss Chapters 6, 7 and 8 during 4 weeks.
</P>
<P>
The last 3 weeks are devoted to a new research area, namely <U>Semicollusion</U>.
See Chapters 9 and 10.

<A NAME="learning"></A>Learning in Economics (Ramon Marimon)
</P>
<P>
This is an introductory course on learning in games and macroeconomic models. We
will study theories and applications. With respect to <I>learning theory</I>
the course is self-contained, nevertheless it is assumed that people attending
the course are familiar with the basic concepts and tools of game theory and
dynamic equilibrium theory. My recent survey &quot;Learning from learning in
economics'' provides a broad overview of the topics (and main and additional
references) that I would like to cover in this course. I will focus on adaptive
learning models, but the emphasis on different topics will also be dictated by
students' interests. There will be some additional lectures by visiting faculty
(e.g., H. Sabourian) that will cover some additional topics (e.g., evolutionary
models). The course will be graded on the basis of assignments and a final exam
(and/or a term paper).
</P>
<P>

<H1>Renaud Dehousse,</H1>

born in 1960, studied at the University of Liege, where he graduated
in law in 1982. He is a doctor of the European University Institute
in law (1988), with a thesis on the external relations of federal
States. From 1985 to 1990 he was research fellow at the Institute
and administrator of the European Policy Unit (EPU). In this capacity
he took part in several multidisciplinary research projects on
decision-making at European level and on Community policies. His
main work has been on comparative aspects of federalism and on
institutional problems of the European Communities. His current
research pursues the development of the European Communities after
1992 in the fields of economic and social regulations in a single
market and the implementation of a common foreign and security
policy. He attempts to identify the relation between the legal
aspects of integration and the developments on the economic and
political level. Since 1989 he has also been editor-in-chief of
the European Journal of International Law, edited at the Institute.

social sciences on issues of European law. Based at the European University
Institute in Florence and published in English, it brings together contributions
across disciplines and national academic traditions.
</P>
<P>
The future of the European Union is now on the agenda. European Union law is in
a phase of transformation, affecting national legal systems, various levels of
government, organizations, interest groups and men and women in a fundamental
way. Substantial changes are bound to follow in teaching, research and practice.
The European Law Journal will be a forum for the debate on these issues.

relations between Europe and other parts of the world, particularly the United
States, Japan, China, the Confederation of Independent States and developing
countries.

<HR>
<H2>Robert Schuman Lecture at the European University Institute in Florence on 27 June 1996
</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
(Spoken word)
</P>
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
It is an honour for me to give the Robert Schuman lecture of 1996 to the Academy
of European Law at the Florence University Institute.
</P>
<P>
I read that this is entitled to be a lecture on Community law - and on preparing
it, I hesitated to compete with all those among you, who are eminent professors
and students in legal affairs.   On the other hand - you invited a politician,
the President of the European Parliament, not to have a special lecture on
Community law, but to get a general impression about what he and his institution
think to be the challenges Europe is facing at the end of this century - and how
to meet them.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, in 1996, twenty years after the death of Robert Schuman, is
beset by challenges and problems.   It will meet those challenges, and we will
meet them, not by imitating the founding fathers, and thus giving old answers to
new questions, but by retaining their vision, their will, and their practical
intelligence to move forward where we can, which is necessary to consolidate our
achievements.
</P>
<P>
The time is not ripe for a revolutionary leap forward. For a total overhaul of
Europe's institutions.  For dramatic blueprints.  For a European constitution. 
The time is not ripe.
</P>
<P>
It is easy for us in Brussels, in Strasbourg, or in Florence, or elsewhere to
theorise about the European Union; to dream up imaginative solutions to our
problems; to be impatient with national politicians, national newspapers, and
national public opinion, and the slow pace at which we are moving forward to the
&quot;ever closer Union of the European peoples&quot;.
</P>
<P>
At Maastricht, we tested the limit of  acceptance of the Union.   For three
months in 1992, from the Danish to the French referendum, we seemed likely to
crash the Union on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the blame can easily be apportioned elsewhere; national politicians
being opportunistic, newspapers playing the xenophobic card, treaties written
behind closed doors, or in incomprehensible language.  
</P>
<P>
All these elements contribute to public scepticism about Europe.  But they only
tell part of the story.
</P>
<CENTER><H2>I</H2></CENTER>
<P>
We find, throughout Europe, a renaissance of nationalism.  It is paradox.  
Where the nation state can less deliver than ever before in history, a growing
part of our citizens focus their affections on the nation state.   And that is
not without logic: because man does not live by bread alone.    In a time of
growing alienation the abstract European institutions, remote as they seem, are
unable to attract the imagination and affection of our people.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950's and 1960's Europe was a vision which inspired.   It was associated
in the public mind with a number of values - peace, solidarity, welfare.
</P>
<P>
The dream will not survive on a diet of routine, detailed, technical,
bureaucratic legislation from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
What we need is not harmonisation of this and that - necessary as it may be in
an internal market - we need courageous new projects in this Europe, to renew
this vision. 
</P>
<P>
Peace is still the source of the European inspiration; the value which binds
governments and peoples to the project for European unity.  And that means that
nationalism and racism must never again get a chance - anywhere in Europe.  It
is our duty to remember it, and to remind our fellow citizens - especially the
younger ones.    This should never be forgotten.  This has something to do with
European unity ....
</P>
<P>
There are those who say that this very justification for Europe and for common
action has less relevance today.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the European Community was born out of the ashes of war, but that renewed
war in Western Europe is now out of the question;  and of course, arguments
about the last war hold little resonance, fifty years on in the younger
generation.
</LI>
<LI>the European Community was also the child of the Cold War.  And as the Cold
War is over, there is less perceived need for further integration.  But peace
and order have not been achieved.  There are still many dangers, in the
uncertainty and turmoil in Eastern Europe.  And there are new perils from the
South with the rise of economic and social problems, extremist movements and
state terrorism.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
That means, uniting Europe is even more necessary than before, not as a response
to the dark shadows of the past, but to meet the challenges of the future. 
</P>
<CENTER><H2>II</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Of course, the greatest worry for people today is an economic one; jobs and job
security.  But was it so different fifty years ago, when economic reconstruction
was the great challenge?
</P>
<P>
People expect action by Europe to put Europe back to work as people, fifty years
ago, expected action by Europe to support reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Putting Europeans back in jobs involves more than job creation schemes.   It
involves the  restructuring and modernising of our economies; tackling the
underlying problems of our competitiveness in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Our industry, our agriculture and our services - even our cultural life -  are
now under a double threat.  The technological advances of South East Asia, on
the one hand - and cheaper labour in Asia and in East and Central Europe, on the
other.  
</P>
<P>
Only one example: the Swiss airline, Swissair has moved its ticketing
operations.  Not to another Swiss town.   Not to some other European city.  But
to Bombay, in India.
</P>
<P>
Europe can never compete by lowering its labour costs to the levels of
South-East Asia.   We have to compete by modernising our economic structures
throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
The great industrial powers of Germany, France, Britain, and Italy scarcely
feature in the top ten, as Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan take their place.  
New industrial forces, Brazil, India and Malaysia are mounting a long-term
challenge.  And China, with a massive pool of low wage labour, threatens to
dominate the world economy in the twenty-first century.
</P>
<P>
In reality, our European economy is falling behind.  In just five years,  we
suffered a loss of almost 18% in our competitiveness.  Year by year, our Member
States, all of them, are falling down the international league tables; first,
for competitiveness; and then, inexorably, for living standards. 
</P>
<P>
It is now South-East Asia, which looks set to be pre-eminent in the key new
economic sectors of semiconductor  technology, biotechnology, and, I fear above
all, information technologies.
</P>
<P>
Europe  must not accept the vision of its future which has all our television
sets coming from Japan, all our TV programmes from America, with Europe just
providing the viewers.  This is not my vision of the European future.
</P>
<P>
We are paying a heavy price for relaxing our research efforts.  Our public
research and development spending lags behind the American and Japanese efforts,
by up to 50%.   This year, even in a downturn, the Japanese are increasing
public research and development spending by nearly 7%. Some American companies
spend nearly as much money on basic research as does the Union of fifteen Member
States covering the whole range of  technologies.
</P>
<P>
Europe must start creating something new, rather than forever patching up the
past.
</P>
<P>
Too many people see European Union  as a repair shop for declining industries
instead of a centre for innovation.
</P>
<P>
A European Union which continues to spend one billion ecus per year on subsidies
for tobacco production in Europe,  instead of developing new materials may not
be short of money but is definitely poor in spirit.
</P>
<P>
The globalization of the world economy pushes us towards a restructuring of our
economies, a modernisation of industry and services.
</P>
<P>
The European Union cannot substitute itself for  national governments, nor 
assume the economic management of the fifteen Member States.
</P>
<P>
The Union's budget is small; about 1,2% of Gross Domestic Product.  In itself,
it does not carry enough clout, to stimulate macroeconomic growth and
employment.
</P>
<P>
The goal of high levels of employment - already a Treaty objective - is a
responsibility which is clearly only complementary to national employment
policies. But there is scope for a European contribution,  through cooperation,
as proposed by the European Commission in the new Employment Pact, with active
labour market policies, and lower taxes on jobs.
</P>
<P>
And through the trans-european networks, the proposal to modernize our transport
and telecommunication infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Through the improvement of our research potential.   And the training and
up-skilling of our work-force.  Through restructuring and modernisation in
common methods, labour costs, the organisation of labour in our society.  The
ideas are there and the plans are there.   What is missing is the political will
to transform the blueprint into reality.
</P>
<P>
The Florence European Council was yet another lost opportunity, in my view.  At
each of the summits I have attended .. Essen, Cannes, Madrid, Torino and, now,
Florence, the conclusions pay  lip-service to the problem of jobs and
competitiveness; they &quot;take note&quot; of the latest Commission initiative:
they take note of the Delors White Book, they take note of  the networks and
they take note of  the Santer Employment Pact.   Then six months later we see
that nothing has happened.   The proposals get mangled by the Finance Ministers
who will not countenance any extra resources for the projects.  And the Economic
Ministers are unwilling to accept the constraints of coordination on their
national policies.
</P>
<P>
And they find enough public and press support - because they follow public
opinion, instead of educating it.
</P>
<P>
Florence failed again to reach agreement on financing transeuropean networks;
the billion ecus needed was too much for the heads of government to agree to
(remember the billion for tobacco every year).  Yet at the same time, and after
little discussion, a billion ecus are released for the beef-market, to
compensate for losses during the BSE crisis, caused mainly by the negligence
over animal health in one of our  Member States.  The Budget of the Union is to
be used again as an emergency rescue service, to remedy the errors of the past;
but it may not be earmarked for modernising Europe's infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
The Budget needs reform: we need to shift resources to the policies of the
future.
</P>
<CENTER><H2>III</H2></CENTER>
<P>
In my view, the single currency is not primarily as an instrument to promote
political union - perhaps it will help ..... But for me, monetary union and the
creation of a single currency are part of the necessary modernisation of the
European economy.   It is also a question of Europe's self-determination.
</P>
<P>
A single currency is necessary to realise the full potential of the internal
market: to reduce costs, to maintain competitiveness.  We have known for some
time that the decisions by national governments on exchange rates are irrelevant
when the speculative flows in the world markets amount to more than a thousand
billion of dollars per day.  Per day!
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in the Maastricht Treaty.   The Treaty has been signed. 
The Treaty has been ratified.  The Treaty must now be implemented.
</P>
<P>
And, the Madrid Summit last December - and now the Florence summit -  confirmed
the timetable, decided the name and set the scenarios, which means that on
January 1st, 1999, we will have a European currency; and that, by 2002, you and
I will have the Euros in our pocket and in our wallets.
</P>
<P>
This is not some routine decision.   The creation of a European Central Bank,
and the introduction of a single currency is the one decision taken since the
war which will affect all our citizens.  Tangibly.  In their pockets.   And, as
a Russian economist said, &quot;If they are creating a Central Bank, then it's
serious&quot;.
</P>
<P>
It is unhelpful to talk about changing the convergence criteria agreed at
Maastricht, and ratified in the Treaty.  There would be no consensus on diluting
or stiffening the criteria.   The criteria are our guarantee that the new money
for Europe will be a strong one.
</P>
<P>
Monetary stability for the whole of the European Union will be achieved if a new
monetary system links those countries who are part of the first group in the
single currency, with those who are not.  Competitive devaluations from
non-participating countries would jeopardise the internal market.
</P>
<P>
And the currency will remain a strong one, provided the disciplines expected
from all, before a single currency is introduced, are not thrown out the window
afterwards.  A stability pact is important to maintain the strength of this
currency.
</P>
<P>
But a reviewed monetary system, and a permanent pact for monetary stability,
require no Treaty changes: they are the logical consequences of the Maastricht
decisions.
</P>
<P>
It is unhelpful to speculate now which countries will qualify to join the
currency in the first group in 1999.   The decision is not for today.   It is
for the beginning of 1998.  Talking about it today merely undermines the efforts
all our countries are making to qualify.  All I can witness is the absolute
determination of all governments to qualify, as soon as possible.  In the end,
the text of the Treaty, the whole text not just the figures, will be applied,
not some German interpretation of it.
</P>
<P>
It is more than unhelpful to link the single currency to job losses; it is
false.  It is not the Maastricht criteria  which are causing all our governments
to cut spending.   It is the survival of our economies and of our social systems
in a fiercely competitive world which imposes budgetary restraint on us all.
</P>
<P>
It is the global competition which makes it impossible to return to the
Keynesian  deficit spending of the 1930's or 60's as a way of creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
And I would point out that Europe's eighteen million unemployed have lost their
jobs in a Europe with fourteen currencies, not in a Europe with a single
currency.   I do not see that having separate francs, liras and deutschmarks has
helped us create a single job.
</P>
<P>
It is unhelpful to talk about postponement.  There is no perfect moment in the
economic cycle.  1999 is a reasonable target date.  Postponement would relax
efforts to qualify.  Postponement would mean that nobody (not financial markets,
and not our citizens) would take a new date more seriously than the current one.
 Postponement would mean cancellation.
</P>
<P>
There will be no second chance.

Citizens will only accept the new common currency, when they can be sure that
also on other fundamental and crucial matters, common action is taken.
</P>
<P>
European unity cannot be constructed exclusively on the foundations of a
monetary policy.  On confronting the environmental menace, in pursuing new
possibilities for creating jobs,  in developing a common foreign and security
policy, and fighting against international organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
It must be built on political projects, which inspire people's imagination,
instead of being drowned in hundreds of usefully detailed regulations and
directives harmonizing this or that technical aspect of the internal market.

environmental protection where Europe can best deliver.

Pollution is not stopped by national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Pollution does not respect national sovereignties.
</P>
<P>
The damage that we have done to our seas, the Mediterranean, the North Sea and
the Baltic Sea  poses a problem of scale which none of our Member States acting
alone can address. 
</P>
<P>
Let us put together proposals, with our partners, for an action programme to
clean up Europe's seas.  This could catch the imagination of our people.  Let us
bring together the private and public sectors in this joint enterprise.
</P>
<P>
And let us tackle the great problem of food hygiene.   A few years ago, we had
the scares of swine fever, and of salmonella.  Today it is BSE in Britain.  
Tomorrow, we will face risks to consumers from fish, from poultry and other
meats, because we have changed the way we raise animals for human consumption,
because we have treated herbivores like carnivores.  It is our agro industrial
food production throughout Europe which can create the same crisis in each of
our Member States.  When man plays God at nature, mankind will be the loser. 
Europe must  tackle this through an overhaul of the CAP, not to save money, but
to save lives.
</P>
<CENTER><H2>IV</H2></CENTER>
<P>
It is now urgent to equip Europe with the means to carry out its new global
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is not and never will be a superpower with dreams of
hegemony.  Its very decentralised institutional structure guarantees this.  But
by its historical links with every part of the globe, by its  own cultural
diversity, by its relative wealth, Europe is uniquely placed to help shape the
new world order.
</P>
<P>
Those who think that the European Union can be an economic giant and remain a
political dwarf may seem to be modest, and realistic. In fact, they are being
irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, no-one knows who speaks for Europe abroad.   Is it the
Commission?   Is it the Council Presidency, currently almost invisible?  Is it
the Council Troika? A South African minister told me a few months ago that the
Americans had warned them about the perils of negotiation with Europe:
</P>
<P>
They say that they can't negotiate because they don't have a mandate; and when
they agree a mandate, they say that they have no scope for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Europe needs strong structures to carry through its foreign policy.   Its
institutions require their own analysis and expertise facilities.   We need
continuity and visibility for those who negotiate on our behalf.   We need
effectiveness in our decision-making.  If every move on foreign policy is
subject to unanimity, we will never be a decisive and reliable partner in
international relations.  
</P>
<P>
But, of course, everything depends on the political will of the Member States.
Do they really wish to have a common foreign policy?   Without such will, no
institutional mechanism, no structural changes, can make our foreign policy
efficient.
</P>
<P>
The test will soon be upon us.   Dayton expires in December.   The agreements
have brought a kind of peace to Bosnia after three years of civil war, and more
than fifty thousand deaths.  In Europe; on the very borders of the Union.   
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire holds, because of a huge IFOR presence.   But a lasting peace is
far from sure.  The resentments, the hatred, the divisions remain.   The war
criminals are still at large.   The elections, planned for September, do not in
themselves bring a guarantee of peace.   If the Americans withdraw on schedule,
we cannot be optimistic that hostilities will not resume.
</P>
<P>
Will Europe have the courage and the will to stay on, to see the crisis through?
  Or will we sit back, powerless, because the Americans have withdrawn?   Public
opinion will not understand if Europe does not show leadership in former
Yugoslavia; keeping the peace, but also leading the reconstruction effort.
</P>
<P>
Security and defence are sensitive questions in a European Union which has
Member States with different traditions and perceptions.   Four of our Member
States have traditions of neutrality.   I have to ask what sense this concept
has in a Europe after the Cold War, and the collapse of the old Soviet Union.
Against whom are they neutral?
</P>
<P>
A common security policy, backed by shared defence, is a necessary instrument of
common foreign policy.   It helps us to carry out our responsibilities in
creating a zone of stability for the whole continent.   I welcome the
Swedish/Finnish initiative to strengthen the Union's common foreign and security
policy and to take part in &quot;Petersberg&quot; type actions.      And I
welcome the conclusions of the recent NATO Ministerial meeting, which recognises
the scope for a certain autonomy of European action, in a NATO framework.   But
I would invite those concerned to face up to full consequences of what they are
seeking: efficient decision-making, and moves towards common defence and that
means: integration of the Western European Union in the Union's Treaty, step by
step.
</P>
<CENTER><H3>- oOo -</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Helping those who have emerged from a dark era of totalitarian dictatorship to
reform themselves, to strengthen democracy and to modernise their economies is a
mission on a heroic scale.    It is an occasion for restating the principles of
solidarity on which the European Community was initially founded.  The prospect
of the European Union becoming a Union for all those in Europe who wish, and are
able, to join is an exciting project.
</P>
<P>
And it corresponds to the self-interest of all our Member States.  The gradual
spread of prosperity to East and Central Europe helps the economy of all the
Member States.
</P>
<P>
Conversely, if we fail to provide backing for economic and political reform in
the new democracies, the consequences will not just be felt in the cities and
towns of Eastern Europe.  A tidal wave of international crime, drug trafficking,
and clandestine immigration will sweep over us all and threaten the security,
stability and ultimately, the democracy of the Member States of the Union. 
Either we export our stability, or we import their instability.
</P>
<P>
The prize of enlargement may be great, but the political price must not be too
high.
</P>
<P>
If the price is the dissolving of the Union into a loose, free-trade zone,
without common policies, without solidarity, without efficient institutions,
then the price will be too high.  Because it would not only destroy the
construction of Europe which has, for fifty years, delivered security, welfare
and solidarity to the Member States; but also because Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic and others want to join a Union that works, not a foundering
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
That is why we have to reform the Union, through Treaty changes.  We have to
adapt and reform the cornerstone policies of the Union, the common agricultural
policy, the structural funds, and the Union's own budget.
</P>
<P>
And the applicant countries have to move further along the road of political and
economic reform.
</P>
<P>
The next enlargement is different in scale and quality, from previous
enlargements.  The Union and the next Member States need time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
It is plainly irresponsible for ministers of governments of Member States to
hold out the year 2000 as the date for the next enlargement.  
</P>
<P>
But holding out any target year for enlargement in 2002, or 2005, or any year -
is equally irresponsible: because it could relax efforts to reform and adapt,
here and in the applicant states.   
</P>
<P>
We should stick to what we know; that negotiations will begin six months after
the end of the Intergovernmental Conference; that means in spring 1998,  and
then use all our efforts to make those negotiations a success - and to prepare
the Union to be able to enlarge without foundering..
</P>
<CENTER><H2>V</H2></CENTER>
<P>
We will not succeed in restoring public faith in Europe, unless the policies of
the Union are seen by the people as being relevant and the reform of the
institutions is not seen as relevant...  But, there will be no success without
institutional reform either.  This is what the Intergovernmental Conference has
to focus on.  To make the Union of fifteen Member States more effective and more
coherent. 
</P>
<P>
Any substantial reform of the Treaty requires the unanimous agreement of all
fifteen governments, of all national parliaments, and in probably half a dozen
cases, electorates through national referendums.  
</P>
<P>
We have to accept that the Treaty reform can only be a limited one.   Europe is,
and will remain, a Union of Member States: not a  superstate or a federation (at
least not in the sense used by the British).  In our European Union, all
fundamental decisions will be taken by the Member States.   They keep the
competence to decide about the competences of the Union.   Member States will
continue to decide on Treaty changes, or new own resources, or on Article 235 of
the Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Nor, in  the main, does the Union need new competences: although some of its
responsibilities, such as over employment should be reinforced.   The different
references to employment should be consolidated: this  would give an important
signal.   New processes of coordination of national economic and employment
policies should be developed and employment made the first criterion for the
structural policies of the Union.  This is true equally for environmental
policy.
</P>
<P>
I continue to believe, however,  that changes to the Treaty must be substantial.
 We need to make the Union more efficient, more democratic, and more open.  We
need it to work better.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, more than one hundred items of legislation, ranging from the
European Company  overriding need to drop the unanimity requirement for ordinary
Union business.  
</P>
<P>
In just four weeks, the United Kingdom government blocked around ninety
decisions or legislative acts: from major decisions like the Draft Regulation to
protect the financial interests of the  Community, to detailed internal market
legislation like a proposal for VAT harmonisation for cut flowers.
</P>
<P>
In the Union, conflicts arise often enough.   Spain fights hard for its fish;
the French are difficult over the CAP; the Germans and the Dutch make a big
argument about the Budget or on trade issues.   Sometimes, they make a link
between one issue and another.   The Spaniards made their agreement to Swedish,
Finnish and Austrian enlargement dependent on assent for more structural funds. 
 The French threatened to veto the number of members of the European Parliament,
if Parliament delayed signing a contract for a new building in Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
These incidents, rare enough, jeopardise the smooth running of the Union.    
</P>
<P>
But the United Kingdom's government went much further.  They sought to
immobilise the Union at a time when the need to act has never been greater.  
This is worse than 'the empty chair'.
</P>
<P>
When a Member State blocks not merely measures it opposes, but also measures it
supports, it goes far beyond the acceptable bounds of behaviour. 
</P>
<P>
And for what?  The British beef crisis is a crisis &quot;made in Britain&quot;,
not &quot;made in Brussels&quot;. The crisis broke not because of a Commission
decision in Brussels, but because of  a ministerial statement in Westminster -
and because Britain abandoned high standards of animal hygiene. 
</P>
<P>
A political decision by governments will not restore their confidence. 
Consumers will only trust beef, if scientific evidence provides reasonable proof
that beef is safe.
</P>
<P>
The other fourteen Member States were, quite rightly, careful in their response.
 Appeasement in the face of blackmail always leads to more blackmail.   If the
Union had overridden scientific objections to lift the worldwide ban on beef
exports prematurely through a political compromise, it would have given a signal
to
<strong>all</strong> Member States that in this Union, blackmail pays.  Their own
domestic opinion will expect nothing less.
</P>
<P>
If in a Union of fifteen, one Member State can bring the Union to a halt, how
vulnerable we will be in a Union of twenty or more Member States.
</P>
<P>
Before the beef crisis, majority voting in the Union for routine business was
desirable.   Now the British government has shown us, it has become an absolute
necessity.
</P>
<P>
Flexibility is necessary.  Flexibility can enable countries to come on board for
certain policies, at different times, according to their capacity.  But
flexibility cannot paper over a fault line between fourteen governments and one
other, which for domestic reasons decides to play the anti-European card.  The
problem of the United Kingdom government, with its strong Europhobic, not
Eurosceptic element,  cannot be resolved by imaginative drafting of Treaty
clauses, and by fanciful institutional gadgets.  It is a basic political problem
which must now be confronted.   And we should be wary of writing into the Treaty
more permanent exemptions and derogations which weaken the Union's capacity to
act in order to deal with a problem, and, indeed, a government which may prove
to be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
If flexibility means countries moving forward, on the same track, but at
different speeds, this can mean progress.   But if flexibility means generalised
permanent  opt-outs, it would be the precursor to dismantling the Union.
</P>
<CENTER><H3>- oOo -</H3></CENTER>

When decisions in Council are taken by majority, national Parliaments can no
longer  hold their ministers fully to account.  It is then, that we want the
European Parliament to share fully in the decisions, through positive
co-decision on equal footing with the Council.
</P>
<P>
Democratic scrutiny means parliamentary control over texts proposed by the
executive; and the right to <strong>improve</strong> legislation by means of amendment.  
If national Parliaments in fifteen Member States start simultaneously to amend
Commission proposals, we will never see texts agreed.   This primary
Parliamentary function - improving legislation - can only be undertaken by the
European Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
We do not want a European Parliament with exclusive decision-making powers,
shaped according to the competences of our national parliaments; but a Union
which takes decisions with a double legitimacy; with the backing of a qualified 
majority of Member States, represented by their governments, and a majority of
the directly elected European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
There is not a battle pitching the European Parliament against national
Parliaments.  There is scope for an objective alliance between parliamentarians,
national and European: National parliaments deciding on all the basic decisions
about the future direction of the Union and making their respective governments
accountable -  the European Parliament concentrating on its duty to improve
Union legislation, and, more broadly, making Brussels accountable. It is a joint
battle for parliamentary democracy.
</P>
<P>
There are some who say that European citizens do not feel that their
representatives in the European Parliament represent them in the same way as
their national Members of Parliament in national parliaments; and that,
therefore, the European Parliament cannot represent the people in decisions in
the Union.
</P>
<P>
It is a mistake ever to have imagined that the European Parliament was going to
be simply a national Parliament, but on a grander scale.   The Parliament
functions differently from our national counterparts.  A multi-language,
multicultural, Parliament with scores of national parties in its ranks cannot be
a copy of any national Parliament. It cannot aspire to the place, held by
national parliaments in the political affections of citizens.  But we can
exercise control on the Commission.  We can improve legislation.   We can
provide a voice for our citizens.  We can provide a forum for the European
peoples in all their great diversity.   We can, and we do, better and better.
</P>
<CENTER><H3>- oOo -</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Strengthening the European Parliament alone is not sufficient to bring democracy
to the European Union.  But without a stronger European Parliament, the Union
will not be democratic.
</P>
<P>
An enhanced role for Parliament is one way of achieving greater openness in the
Union.
</P>
<P>
I am not convinced that openness can always be equated with television crews
circulating at Council  meetings.   If you open up Council deliberations to the
press, you can end up with ministers making statements just for the gallery,
with the real negotiations going underground.
</P>
<P>
Openness is best achieved through enhancing public understanding and awareness
of the decision-making process.   At the moment, no-one knows who decides what,
when, and how, in Brussels.  The twenty-two different decision-making procedures
- and I am not even counting the Budget - have made the way Brussels works seem
like a secret society.   Only academics, like yourselves, at the frontiers of
institutional technology, can hope to understand what goes on.
</P>
<P>
Parliament's views, shared now by many governments is that the number of
procedures should be reduced basically to three;
</P>
<UL>
<LI>codecision, for legislation, particularly where Qualified Majority voting
applies; for all areas covered by the first  pillar;
</LI>
<LI>parliamentary assent, for matters still decided by Council, unanimously;
that is, for Treaty changes, enlargement, international agreements, increases in
own resources, Article 235 decisions, and for those questions remaining in the
Third pillar;
</LI>
<LI>and consultation, and information, for questions of foreign policy - the
traditional preserve of the executive.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
A simpler Treaty, with clarity as to who decides what, is the best means of
overcoming the bureaucratic remoteness which most of our citizens perceive as
the characteristic of the Union. 
</P>
<P>
Then, of course, we should seek fuller disclosure, access to documents,
information about the way decisions are taken in Council: but the key to
openness is transparency in the text of the Treaty itself.
</P>
<CENTER><H3>- oOo -</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Decision-making in the first pillar should be improved along those lines; more
majority voting, extension of co-decision, and more openness.   But it is for
the third pillar - cooperation in Justice and Internal Affairs - that we see how
inadequate decision-making structures can thwart progress.
</P>
<P>
The balance sheet for the third pillar is practically blank.   After three
years, a handful of conventions on minor aspects of cooperation on, for example,
asylum issues have been approved in principle, but  none in practice have been
ratified. 
</P>
<P>
It is essential that the Intergovernmental Conference should recognise the
limits to intergovernmentalism.   The regulatory aspects of cooperation on
Justice and Home Affairs, should be transferred to the first pillar, for normal,
Union decision-making; particularly for asylum questions and for immigration
from third countries.
</P>
<P>
The grid-lock will not be overcome by a purely institutional approach.   There
is a problem of political will here, as elsewhere.   That it took three years to
overcome the hurdles to set up EUROPOL, which will now have to be approved by
all national Parliaments; that the Schengen agreements are still not in force
between the countries that agreed to them years ago are signs that Member
States, and Home Affairs Ministries in particular are not yet prepared to
cooperate  fully in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the public desire for action by the Union is perhaps greatest in this area;
to combat drug trafficking, transfrontier fraud, and crime, insecurity on our
streets, clandestine immigration. A strong, and effective justice and internal
policy for the Union is vital to public acceptance of the Union, and, in the end
to the future of the internal market itself.
</P>
<CENTER><H3>- oOo -</H3></CENTER>
<P>
It is too early to form a judgement on the work of the Intergovernmental
Conference, which began its work in Turin, at the end of March.   The IGC is
better prepared than previous conferences. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament is more closely involved with the Intergovernmental Conference than
in the past.  Our own position is clear, and enjoys support, on the main issues,
 from a majority of governments.
</P>
<P>
If the IGC fails to make progress, it is not just Treaty revision which will
suffer.   If we cannot deepen the Union, we will not widen it.
</P>
<P>
If we cannot strengthen the political dimension of European cooperation, we
cannot expect our citizens to accept a single currency.
</P>
<P>
It is possible to discern the outline of a compromise on most of the main
issues: extending majority voting, with in parallel, codecision for the
Parliament; moving some of the Third pillar questions to the Community
decision-making framework; strengthening common foreign and security policy,
through some majority voting,  and greater visibility and continuity.  
</P>
<P>
The fourteen must give a signal to the United Kingdom of their determination to
proceed.  The future of the Union must not be held to ransom because of splits
in the British government, or because of crude anti-Europeanism in British
newspapers owned by Americans, Canadians or Australians.
</P>
<P>
The fourteen must not allow the British problem, which can only be solved by
elections in Britain which have to take place in the next ten months - to lower
their ambitions for the Intergovernmental Conference, and for the future of the
Union.

A successful European Union has to be built on a certain European identity.
</P>
<P>
Can there be a real European identity?
</P>
<P>
Europeans do not feel that they &quot;belong to Europe&quot;, in the way that
the French belong to France, or the Italians to Italy.
</P>
<P>
When the tuna war broke out between Spain and Canada, the Scottish and Cornish
fishing fleets sported the maple leaf, not the Spanish flag - let alone the
European  flag.  When Italy plays Brazil in the World Cup, I think we can guess
who the Portuguese will be supporting.
</P>
<P>
European symbols cannot create a European identity, as if by magic.  Do you
think my fellow citizens in Duisburg, people in Madrid, or Marseilles, or G&ouml;teborg
care about what is called in the Treaty &quot;European citizenship&quot;?    A
European passport was produced, but border controls still remain.   A European
anthem was chosen, but this does not make Europe speak with one voice.
</P>
<P>
The truth of the matter is that there is not one European people but many
European peoples.  There is not one European language but a plethora of tongues.
There is not one European culture, but a richness of European cultures,
experiences, traditions, history.
</P>
<P>
We should not search for a European identity modelled on national identities. 
European citizenship is not about Europeans belonging to Europe but of Europe
belonging to Europeans.  European identity is about shared values.
</P>
<P>
Do we have to be French to believe in human rights?  Do we have to be Swedish to
share the value of sustainable development and ecological responsibility?  Do we
have to be German or Italian to share the value of social justice as the basis
for economic competitiveness?  Germans, and French, and Basque, and Scottish,
and Italian men and women come together in a polity on the basis of shared
values. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, there is a European way of life.  In Europe, uniquely, we have found
a balance between the market - freedom of the market, and power of the market -
and social protection.   In all our Member States, we have developed social
systems, based on access to health and welfare for all our citizens.  We have a
European consensus on the role and duties of public authorities, of government. 
In all Member States we are searching for this unique balance between individual
freedom and collective responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Those shared values, and the gradual development of a European public opinion,
can in turn lead to a European identity, based not on homogeneity, but on
diversity; not on uniformity; but on tolerance.
</P>
<P>
Then Europeans will feel that they belong to Europe - not instead of belonging
to Italy, or to Greece, or to Bavaria, or to the Netherlands - but as well.
</P>
<P>
A European identity is not a substitute for national identity nor for regional
or local identities.  European identity is complementary to the sense of
belonging we already have to our country, to our region, to our town, to our
local community.  European identity makes positive nationalism - pride in one's
country - both more complete and of more value.
</P>
<P>
Nations alone can no longer deliver.  They can no longer  match people's
aspirations.  But, powerlessness undermines  community and faith in the nation
and institutions.
</P>
<P>
It is through common institutions and common policies that the Europeans can
best regain control over their lives, in a global economy, and in the face of
the great challenges to our environment, to security and to peace for all people
in Europe.  To face the power of global forces, our great chance for
self-determination is a United Europe. 
</P>
<P>
I refute the psychosis of failure and pessimism which bedevils Europe.
</P>
<P>
We should not seek to scare our citizens with the consequences of failure.
</P>
<P>
We should excite and enthuse them with the prospects for success.
</P>
<P>
European Union is about empowerment.  European Union is about enabling the
Europeans to regain control of their destiny, in rebuilding faith in public
authority, in the community, in the nation, and in Europe.  In a world of
constant change, reinventing Europe is the key to its lasting success.

The Collected Courses of the Academy of European Law are published annually in
two volumes which offer to law students, academics and practitioners both an
accessible and contemporary introduction to more or less the full range of
European Law, and a series of exhaustive analyses for experts on current issues.
In this way, we aim to construct a living corpus of law which over the next
decade will build up an Encyclopedia covering all areas of European Law.

<P>The European Foreign Policy Bulletin (former European Political Cooperation
Documentation Bulletin) brings together documents issued in the framework of the
European common foreign and security policy (former European political
cooperation). It spans the period since 1985.</P>
<P>
It includes:
</P>
<UL><LI> the common positions and joint actions adopted by the Council;
</LI>
<LI>the official declarations of the European Council, of the Foreign Ministers
and of the Twelve, including statements in international conferences and
organizations;</LI>
<LI>documents related to the European Parliament, i.e. replies to oral and
written questions, statements and reports presented by the Presidency (or
abstracts thereof) on matters of CFSP/EPC.</LI></UL>
<P>Besides the documents relating to the sessions of the United Nations General
Assembly , the European Foreign Policy Bulletin also reports the votes cast by
the Fifteen/Twelve in the General Assembly and in the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>Documents are normally published in English or in French if no official
English version is available. They have been given a unique document number for
quick reference in the index of the Bulletin and for purposes of citation. The
document number indicates the year in which the document is issued, as well as
the place of that document in the European Foreign Policy Bulletin. Documents
are ordered chronologically, and numbered consecutively throughout the volume
covering one year.  The cumulative index of the European Foreign Policy Bulletin
refers to document numbers, and therefore to the place of a document in a given
volume. If for technical reasons a document cannot be included in the printed
volume concerning the year in which it was issued, it will be published in a
later volume. In the cumulative index a reference to such a document will be
accompanied by a reference to the volume in which the document can be found. 
</P>
<P>Each document is accompanied by basic information concerning the date of
issue, the city of issue, its status, and the country holding the Presidency. 
The cumulative index contains different classes of information for which the
documents have been specifically analysed. This index has been developed by
members of the European Policy Unit and the Institut f&uuml;r Europ&auml;ische
Politik, aided by a group of experts which includes senior diplomats and
scholars of several European Community Member States. It is designed to cover
all aspects of European political cooperation, its structure and activity. Thus
one will find the following classes of information:
</P>
<UL><LI>The category CFSP/EPC structure and procedure contains all references
to statements of CFSP/EPC which comment on or illustrate the working of EPC or
its relation with the European Communities.</LI>
<LI>The category Contacts reports all official relations with third countries,
international organizations and political groupings.</LI>
<LI>Geographical reference categories indicate countries, regions and
subregions, whenever these are intrinsically dealt with.</LI></UL>
<UL><LI>The category International organizations and political groupings does
the same for all international organizations, political groupings and
conferences of relevance to CFSP/EPC.</LI></UL>
<UL><LI>Finally, issues are classified by subject matter in the general Issues
category.</LI></UL>
<P>The index is open-ended to enable the inclusion of new issues as they arise
on the agenda of European common foreign and security policy.

born 1934, graduated in Law from the University of Padua, and subsequently
earned a doctorate in sociology from the University of California at Berkeley.
After holding an assistantship at the University of Florence for three years, in
1964 he became a lecturer in the Department of Sociology at the University of
Edinburgh. Subsequently promoted to Reader and to Professor, he remained in
Edinburgh for 24 years; in 1988 he joined the faculty of the University of
Virginia, where since 1990 he held the W.R. Kenan Chair of Sociology. In the
course of these years he held visiting appointments in sociology or in political
science at other Universities in North America, Europe, and Australia, and
fellowships at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences at
Stanford (California) and at the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin. Most of his
teaching and research revolve around two main themes: the nature and development
of modern political institutions (he has published two books on the state); and
the content and present significance of 'classical' social theory (his three
books in this area discuss Tocqueville, Marx, Durkheim, Weber, and Simmel).

born in 1958, is a graduate of the University of Economics, Budapest, and has a
Ph. D. from the University of Texas at Austin in 1987. Since 1981 he has been a
researcher at the Institute of Sociology of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences,
and was British Council Research Fellow at the Centre for Democracy, Polytechnic
of Central London, in 198990. His work has related to the economic and social
thought of Say, SaintSimon and Sismondi using works of Michel Foucault; the
empirical study of continuity and discontinuity in political and basic human
values in Hungary; and the genealogy of bolshevik type state parties, on the
basis of an empirical study of the communist party apparatus and an historical
study of the early modern 'police'. His current research is on the common
problematics of the works of Weber, Nietzsche, Elias and Foucault; it also
investigates empirically the establishment of the new systems of local
government in Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Republics, and attempts to
situate these changes with reference to the broad history of the emergence of
the modern state in Western Europe.

<H3>3. Programmes</H3> 
<H4>3.1. Programme on European Institutions</H4> 
<P>
<STRONG>3.1.1. EC Decision-making Efficiency under the Single European Act
(SEA)</STRONG> <BR> The purpose of this project was to update and improve upon
previous studies of &quot;lourdeur&quot; by undertaking an empirical examination
of the decision-making process since the changes introduced by the SEA. Based on
conclusions and predictions of previous studies it is expected to find more
rapid, extensive and efficient decision-making during the period 1986-1993.
</P>
<P>
The study addressed three central measures of mechanical lourdeur: changes in
Council output, changes in Commission output, changes in legislative backlog. As
previous studies suffered from serious methodological shortcomings, more time
than was originally anticipated was spent gathering comprehensive and reliable
data for the years prior to the SEA, thus laying the necessary groundwork for
any meaningful comparisons with post-1986 developments.
</P>
<P>
In fact it was in the area where many of the most important findings were made.
Previous studies have concluded that both Commissions and Council output had
declined in the late 1970s, but that the former predominated, allowing the
Council to make a &quot;dramatic year by year reduction&quot; in the backlog of
legislation (<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/AEL/weiler.html">J.H.H. Weiler </A>and
al., <EM>Integration through Law</EM>, Berlin/N.Y., De Gruyter, 1986, p. 55).
Weiler's data suggested that this backlog began to shrink as early as 1974. He
therefore concluded that up until 1981 there was no evidence of mechanical
lourdeur in the EC. His results further suggested that both the backlog and
overall legislative output would continue to shrink. Such became the generally
accepted wisdom in a field where quantitative studies are sorely lacking.
</P>
<P>
Some of Weiler's conclusions were contradicted by a later study, which found
that both Council and Commission legislative output had grown steadily, not just
during th eperiod 1975-1981 which Weiler had examined, but also from 1982-1986
(T. Sloot and V. Verschvren, &quot;Decision making speed in the European
Community&quot;,
<EM>Journal of Common Market Studies</EM>, n&#176; 1, September 1990, pp.
75-85). This more recent study also contradicts Weiler's prediction that
legislative backlog would diminish. Sloot found that during 1979-86 the rate of
backlog decreased slightly but the backlog itself continued to grow.
Nevertheless, both studies conclude that there are no signs of mechanical
lourdeur within the EC.
</P>
<P>
The present findings refine and contradict aspects of both of these earlier
studies, and suggest that the EC suffered a substantial amount of mechanical
lourdeur during the period 1972-1995. Unlike either of the two previous studies,
it has been possible to identify precisely which aspects of EC decision making
experienced lourdeur and those which continued to grow during this period.
</P>
<P>
3.1.2. Fusion of EC Treaties <BR> At the request of the European Parliament
Research Service, the RSC has been given the task of consolidating the Community
treaties. The main objectives are to eliminate the obsolete parts, rationalise
the organisation of the founding treaties, and prepare the ground for an
improvement of the &quot;basic law&quot; of Europe. Two final draft texts (one
more &quot;conservative&quot;, the other more &quot;ambitious&quot;) have been
presented to the European Parliament on 29 October 1996 - 
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/RSC/TREATY/Welcome.html">
http://www.iue.it/RSC/TREATY/Welcome.html</A>. 
</P>
<H4>3.2. Programme on Economic Policy</H4> 
<P>
The programme in economic policy was designed to promote discussion and research
in areas of economics with policy significance. It was always envisaged that
this would be done by exploiting a variety of means: regular general seminars,
focussed seminar series; conferences; published working papers; short-stay Jean
Monnet Chair visits and an active research programme. The discussion of the
programme in its first year is organized below under these heads.
</P>
<P>
<EM>The general seminar series</EM> <BR> The general seminar series has been
organized in conjunction with the Department of Economics.
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/ECO/artis.html">Professor Artis </A>was also
appointed organizer of that department's macroeconomics workshop, which has
allowed a useful degree of flexibility in planning for the series. Seminar
speakers have been invited at a frequency of (on average) one every two weeks.
Whilst most of the papers given have been concerned with issues in the area of
international monetary economics, it was considered appropriate to attempt to
stimulate debate in two other areas: environmental economics and the economics
of crime. Although the audiences for papers in these latter areas have been
small, they have been different ones from those attracted to the international
economics seminars and it is intended to invite further speakers in these areas
in the future.
<BR>
<EM>Seminars in European Monetary Integration</EM> <BR> In addition to the
general seminar series, a focussed seminar series was organised for the second
term of the academic year on the theme of European Monetary Integration. This
series has been advertised as a suitable teaching course for economics students
in their second year and above but has in addition attracted a number of members
of staff as well as students from other departments (notably, SPS).
</P>
<P>
<EM>Research</EM> <BR> Professor Artis has continued a programme of personal
research, funded by the EUI's Research Council, the Leverhulme Trust and the
Schuman Centre, which has produced a number of publications. A grant application
for additional funding is currently before the Bank of England. The OECD
published the results of some earlier work and has agreed to provide a detailed
and extensive database to facilitate further analysis; Professor Artis present
some of the results of his work with the OECD database at an OECD workshop in
October. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office has provided funding to
facilitate Professor Artis's participation in the work of the European Financial
Markets Programme based at the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research in London.
</P>
<H4>3.3. Programme on Eastern and Central Europe
</H4> 
<P>
The aim of the programme is to promote the development of policy-relevant
inter-disciplinary research focusing on Central and Eastern Europe. Challenges,
opportunities and dilemmas confronting the European Union in its relations with
Central and Eastern Europe are at the center of attention.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Principal Areas of Enquiry :</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>
<EM>1) Democratic consolidation in Central and Eastern Europe
<BR>
</EM>This area of research seeks to examine major pillars of democratic
consolidation in Central and Eastern Europe such as representative government,
civil society, economics and security. What are the major challenges to the new
democracies? Which factors contribute to the success of democracy-building, and
which to its failure? Can we identify a set of policies that would allow the
nascent democracies to endure? All fourteen countries in the region that have
reached the stage of democratic consolidation before 1996 are analysed in a
comparative perspective.
</P>
<P>
<EM>2) The EU enlargement eastward: utility, visibility, implications
<BR>
</EM>In this context, the objective is to address the complex set of issues
related to a possible further enlargement of the European Union. What is the
balance of public and political perceptions of enlargment in both Eastern and
Western Europe? Which different criteria can be applied in judging the
appropriateness of enlargement? What is the cross-cutting calculation of
benefits and costs of enlargement in terms of security, economics and cultural
identity? How to differentiate between various candidates? What alternatives are
there to the policy of enlargement?
</P>
<P>
<EM>3) Balancing the Union's Southern and Eastern European dimensions
<BR>
</EM>This area of research focuses on the issues of order, stability and
cooperation in Europe. Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean countries of North
Africa and the Middle East confront the European Union with a different set of
opportunities and challenges. Moreover, individual EU members have different
interests, expectations and types of relations with the countries of Eastern
Europe and the Mediterranean region. However, maintaining peace and stability on
EU borders requires coordinated efforts by all EU members on both geo-strategic
flanks. The aim of this research is to identify various cultural, economic and
political gaps between Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean region, and to
suggest ways of bridging them.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Research related activities</STRONG> 
</P>
<P>
<EM>Policy Round Table</EM> <BR> The purpose is to bring together leading
academics in the field and policy-makers from European institutions and national
governments. Successive Round Tables intend to address specific urgent questions
related to Central and Eastern Europe and to offer a concise academicexpertise
with direct policy application.
</P>
<P>
<EM>East-West Forum</EM> <BR> The Forum is about teaching and training actual
and potential university professors from Central and Eastern Europe. Two
training sessions are envisaged per year to deal with various aspects of
European integration, the rule of law, human rights and civil society in Europe.
</P>
<P>
<EM>The Raymond Aron Annual Lecture</EM> <BR> Leading European intellectuals
and politicians are invited once a year to present their views on the most
pressing economic, political and geo-strategic problems related to Eastern
Europe. The aim is to inspire a policy-oriented research agenda for academic
specialists in the field.<BR> Within that framework,
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/SPS/Dept/zielon.html">Prof. Zielonka</A> has organised a
workshop on the enlargement of the European Union Eastward during which a
project proposal was drafted, entitled : <EM>After the First Wave: Managing
Concentric Enlargement of the EU.</EM> In June a researcher from the University
of Siena will be recruted to do a pilot project on Rumania.<BR> These projects
complement the research proposal on Democratic consolidation supported by the
Research Council in november 1995.
</P>
<H4><STRONG>3.4. Programme on EU Regulatory Policy Making</STRONG>
</H4> 
<P>
In the last ten or so years however, particular historical processes and
political trends, alongside significant technological developments have resulted
in a growing push towards liberalisation and commercialisation of these
industries. Both the &quot;public&quot; and the &quot;monopoly&quot;
characteristics of the network sectors are being increasingly challenged with
both privatisation and the introduction of competition.
<BR> Two characteristics of &quot;re-regulation&quot; in Europe are
particularly interesting. One is that, as national restrictions are abolished
markets and market players cease to recognise national boundaries, regulation
must be applied, or at least coordinated at a supra-national level (i.e. EU or
WTO). The other is that markets and market players cease to recognise the
traditional sectorial boundaries which were only held in place by restrictions
on market entry (rail, electricity and broadcasting companies are entering
telecoms markets, telecoms companies enter the computer software and media
markets etc). Accordingly re-regulation needs to be similarly flexible and so
tends to become less &quot;sector specific&quot; -i.e. there is increasing use
of general competition policy to regulate the market.<BR> Re-regulation (or
perhaps more simply &quot;regulation&quot;) of liberalised network sectors of
the European economy would be the central subject matter of the research
programme.<BR> The development concerned is not just an institutional one,
although institutional questions will be very significant. What lies behind
institutional change are in depth policy questions and theoretical challenges.<BR>
So far economists have tended to approach the problem from the point of view of
the economic effects of regulation in particular market sectors. They are
beginning to address in various ways questions such as: the role of regulation
and competition policy
<EM>vis &agrave; vis</EM> network economies; balancing the virtues of economies
of scope and scale against the benefits of increased competition; the extent to
which pricing may be seen to be fair or anti-competitive; the importance of
developing internal accounting practices (and accounting separation) for
dominant players, etc.
<BR> Overall, the area where academic research has been most lacking, and where
it is increasingly called for, relates, on the one hand, to increase its <EM>breadth</EM>
of vision, to draw together many of these different strands of thought, and on
the other, to a more rigorous refocusing of these efforts on the urgent problems
actually facing policy makers now. <BR> Certain aspects of the structure and
context of the EUI make it particularly well suited, indeed, perhaps uniquely
well suited, to meet this demand:<BR> Firstly, the study of developments in
regulatory policy making is inherently an <EM>interdisciplinary</EM> one. The
research programme will be particularly important in its function as
coordinating the work of relevant political scientists, lawyers and economists.
The fact that political science, law and economics represent three out of the
four academic disciplines pursued at the Institute is clearly an important
platform, even a pre-requisite, for such coordination.<BR> Second, as concerns
the study of EU regulation the research programme thus particularly emphasises,
both in its methodology and its subject of study, the importance of overcoming &quot;regulatory
lag&quot; (and the related &quot;academic lag&quot;). This refers to the growing
gap between changes in the market and appropriate changes in the <EM>regulation</EM>
of that market. In fact, market developments in the field under investigation,
especially in telecommunications, tend to be running far ahead of both
regulatory responses and related academic analysis. Part of the problem is
institutional inertia and anachronistic divisions, reflected both in terms of
research projects and in terms of actual policy making (for example between
certain disciplines and approaches, between traditional market sectors and
between EU member states).<BR> Third, the new EUI programme on EU regulatory
policy making will provide an ideal framework for ongoing activities in the
Robert Schuman Centre and, possibly, in other departments. It would of course
become the overarching construction for all research activities on <EM>competition
policy</EM> (inside and outside the Centre). It would also become the wider
framework for research on the <EM>independent EU agencies</EM>.
</P>
<H4>3.5. Programme on The Politics of Law and Order in Europe</H4> 
<P>
As part of the initiatives of the joint programme on &quot;The Politics of Law
and Order in Europe&quot;, an international conference was held at the European
University Institute, on the &quot;The Policing of Mass Demonstrations in
Contemporary Democracies&quot;, 13-14 October 1995, at the initiative of
Donatella della Porta. The policing of protest was chosen as an extremely
important field for the analysis of the relationships between the state and the
civil society. The evolution of the control of mass demonstrations, as well as
the adaptability of the police strategies to the new challenges of the nineties
appeared as particularly interesting topic for the analysis of contemporary
democracies. The aim of the conference was to bring together scholars from
different countries and disciplines, with a background in empirical research on
the policing of protest.
</P>
<H3>4. Ongoing Research Projects</H3> 
<H4>4.1. Project on Abstention at the European Parliamentary Elections</H4> 
<P>
On the basis of the funding which the Schuman Centre was fortunate to receive
from the European Commission and the European Parliament in 1994, marked
progress has been made on the analysis of the characteristics of abstention at
European parliamentary elections. This is a subject of major importance if we
are to be able to understand and subsequently attempt to remedy the marked
apathy, to say the least, which a large number of citizens of the European
Union, in a number of countries at least, display towards elections to the
European Parliament, an apathy which has been on the increase since these
elections were introduced.<BR> The originator and key investigator of the
project, Dr Richard Sinnott, of the University College Dublin, and this two
collaborators, Professors Jean Blondel, of the Schuman Centre and previously of
the Department of Political and Social Science, and Palle Svensson, of the
University of Aarhus, held two meetings in the course of the academic year at
which drafts of the first five chapters of the proposed volume on abstention
were discussed; Dr Sinnott also attended a meeting at San Sebastian late in 1995
in which he presented a paper based on the draft of chapter two of the volume.
The completion of the work in draft form is planned for September 1996: a
workshop is foreseen at the EUI shortly afterwards to discuss the main findings
of the book.
</P>
<H4>4.2. Climate Change Policies in the European Union
</H4> 
<P>
<EM>Objectives and outline of work carried out</EM> <BR> This project was
co-funded by DG XI (Environment) of the European Commission. A project
coordinator, Dr. Ute Collier (previously Jean Monnet Fellow in the Centre), was
appointed in October 1994, working under the direction of Profs.
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/SPS/Dept/meny.html">M&eacute;ny</A> and Majone. <BR> The
main focus of the project was on the political feasibility of policy action
related to climate change. Its principal aim was to identify the political and
related economic as well as social constraints for the implementation of
effective climate change policies in the EU. Furthermore, opportunities for
future policy action were highlighted. These issues were addressed through a
more general study of social and distributional effects of various policy
actions (with some empirical data from member states) and detailed case studies
of selected member states. The case studies were chosen both because of their
importance in overall emission terms and to highlight similarities and
differences in the problems encountered by countries with very heterogeneous
emission characteristics, when trying to implement global emission targets.<BR>
As concerns the country case studies, the resources and time-scales of the
project did not allow the preparation of detailed case studies for all fifteen
member states. Too many case studies would also have made the project unwieldy.
It was thus decided to prepare studies for seven member states which were
expected to provide a representative picture of the diverse situations
encountered within the fifteen. They were also to include the EU's largest
emitters, as well as look at 'old' and new member states. Hence, Denmark,
Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK were chosen, whose combined
emissions account for nearly 85% of the EU15 total.
</P>
<P>
<EM>Project findings</EM> <BR> The project identified the following
constraints as most important to the implementation of effective climate change
policies: <BR> * Overriding priority allotted to economic growth and industrial
competitiveness, linked withshort-term thinking <BR> * Procedural constraints,
especially the lack of consistent integration between environmental and other
policies<BR> * Institutional and regulatory frameworks for the energy sector
<BR> * Industrial opposition, especially to energy taxes<BR> * Disagreements
about the role of nuclear power <BR> * Rapid growth in transport demand, e.g.
due to liberalisation of trade and deregulation of the transport sector <BR> *
Inherent attractiveness of private over public transport <BR> * Lack of
public/pressure group interest
</P>
<P>
A number of these were found to be part of the same problem, namely the lack of
a coherent and comprehensive integration of climate change objectives into
economic policy making. Priority continues to be given to traditional objectives
such as economic growth and industrial competitiveness, and short-term thinking
prevails. These objectives are not necessarily incompatible with climate change,
especially as far as energy efficiency is concerned. Yet, public, political and
especially industrial opposition, reluctant to see any real changes to the
status quo, is strong. <BR> The findings suggest that a major effort is needed
to improve the political feasibility of climate change policies. It is easy to
adopt a rather pessimistic outlook in view of the constraints encountered so
far, but at the same time it has to be recognised that there has been some
capacity building and social learning, resulting in a rethink in some areas.
This needs to continue, with a particular emphasis on the participation of all
relevant actors in the policy process. As far as the involvement of the general
public is concerned, local authorities (especially within the wider framework of
Local Agenda 21) and NGOs can play an important role.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the project has shown that there are some opportunities related to
energy sector liberalisation, transport and land-use planning, as well as the
activities of local authorities. For the first two, it is important that climate
change objectives are considered as a priority, which to date has been rather
neglected. As far as local authorities are concerned, a supportive national and
EU policy framework is crucial.
</P>
<H4>4.3. The Political Economy of the Life Course
</H4> 
<P>
The project is in essence a study of new emerging patterns of inequality and
stratification examined not in the traditional manner, but through the interface
between life cycles and public policies. As is well-known, both social and
labour market policy in the postwar era assumed a combination of sustained
(male) full employment and the traditional family model. Welfare state
programmes were primarily directed to the two passive tail-ends of the human
life course: childhood and old age, while paying only marginal attention to the
&quot;active years&quot;. Contemporary transformation in the labour market, in
the occupational structure, and also demographic changes conspire to undermine
these assumptions and also to alter the structures of social risks. In
particular, risks such as unemployment, job or career change, re-education,
family breakdown, divorce or single parenthood are growing rapidly and, as a
consequence, this implies a growing disjuncture between the existing structure
of social protection and the concentration of human needs and risks.
</P>
<P>
The general aim is to comparatively examine how social and labour market
policies together with institutional factors influence the changing life cycle
risk patterns. It therefore involves research both on welfare state programmes
and on life courses; i.e. analyses of both policy and of event history type
data. This project will be placed under the direction of G. Esping-Andersen.

<H2>Rober Schuman Centre - Academic Activities</H2> 
<H3>5. Support to the Working Groups</H3> 
<P>
The Robert Schuman Centre currently supports several Working Groups at the
Institute.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Working Group on Environmental Studies</STRONG> <BR> Set up in 1987,
this inter-disciplinary group organises research seminars by EUI members and
external experts. An extensive network of contacts has been established with
environmental institutes around the world. In 1992, the conference focused on
environmental and transport issues in Europe. In 1994, the group organised a
conference on &quot;access to environmental justice in Europe&quot;, in 1995 on &quot;Subsidiarity
and shared responsability&quot; and in 1996 on &quot;Deregulation and
Environment&quot;. The group publishes a bi-annual
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/WGES/Welcome.html">newsletter</A>.</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Working Group on International Relations</STRONG> <BR> This group,
established in 1993, seeks to promote the inter-disciplinary study of
international relations, providing a specifically European focus for the
discussion of international relations. Seminars are held by members of the
Institute and external experts. In 1994, a workshop was organised on &quot;Approaches
to European Multilateralism&quot;, in 1995 on &quot;Theory synthesis in
International Relations&quot; and in 1996 on &quot;Governing Europe into the
21st century&quot;.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Working Group on Central and Eastern Europe</STRONG> 
<BR> The inter-disciplinary group was established in 1991 with a view to
addressing policy problems in Western, Central and Eastern Europe. In 1992, a
conference was held on &quot;Impediments to the Transition: The Eastern European
Countries and the Policies of the European Community&quot;, and in 1993,
workshops were held on &quot;Industrial relations, unions and labour markets in
Central and Eastern Europe in Transition&quot;, and &quot;Privatization and
Property Rights&quot;. In 1995, a round table was organised on the conflict in
Bosnia. With the programme directed by
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/SPS/Dept/zielon.html">Professor Zielonka</A>, this
Working Group take an active part in these activities.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Working Group on Gender and Society</STRONG> <BR> Set up in 1990, the
group has organised a series of seminars on &quot;Woman's citizenship in Europe
from the 18th to the 20th century and the relationship between the public and
private spheres&quot;, and workshops on &quot;The rights of woman&quot; (in
honour on Mary Wollstonecraft's &quot;A vindication of the rights of woman&quot;),
and on &quot;Gender and labour law&quot;.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Working Group on Regional and Federal Questions</STRONG>
<BR> The Regions Working group, established in 1993, seeks to provide a forum
for research on European regional issues, including comparative member state and
European Union policies and changes in relations between subnational, national
and supranational levels. In 1994-1995 seminars covered topics such as regional
politics in Southern Europe, the concept of multi-tiered policy making and the
EU's Committee of the Regions. In 1996 some seminars were organised with
external speakers (e.g. Carlo Trigilia on &quot;The development of the
Mezzorgiono during the last 20 years&quot;.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Working Group on Bioethics</STRONG> <BR> Established in 1994 with the
collaboration of Prof. Cosimo Mazzoni (University of Siena), the working group
has concentrated his work on a few topics within these broad and new areas of
questions with a special regard to the legal aspects. Statutory definition of
the human embryo, embryo experimentation, euthanasia, and genetic informations
were discussed. Guest speakers (Profs. Labrousse-Riou, Nielsen, Ricolfi, Zatti,
etc.) gave seminars and helped to better understand these crucial issues.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Working Group on Refugees</STRONG> <BR> Founded in September 1995, the
Working Group on Refugees is an inter-disciplinary group, made up of first,
second and third year researchers from, predominantly, the Law and SPS
departments though it is, of course, open to all. It meets on a regular basis to
discuss various refugee, immigration and human rights issues, as suggested by
members of the Group. In June 1996 the Group hosted a &quot;<EM>Roundtable on
Repatriation&quot;</EM> to discuss the legal and policy issues concerning the
repatriation of refugees to the former Yugoslavia. The proceedings of the
Roundtable are to be published in the <EM>International Journal of Refugee Law</EM>.
</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Working Group on Telecommunications and Multimedia</STRONG>
<BR> Given the broad and interdisciplinary nature and the implications of the
rapidly evolving information society, the idea behind the creation of this
working group in December 1995 quickly attracted around 20 researchers from all
departments. The issues addressed in these first meetings that took place in
1996 were varied, but always enlightening and led to very interesting debates.
</P>
<H3>6. Other Activities </H3> 
<H4>6.1. Summer School</H4> 
<P>
The Robert Schuman Centre held annual environmental summer workshop at the EUI.
The workshop, organised and chaired by Dr. Jonathan Golub, receives financial
support from DGXI of the European Commission. The workshop highly
interdisciplinary bring together speakers and participants from the fields of
law, political science and economics.<BR> The 1996 workshop was entitled &quot;Regulatory
Reform and EU International Environmental Agreements&quot; and focused on how
global economic competition and other pressures for deregulation and
reregulation have affected various aspects of EU external environmental policy.
</P>
<H4>6.2. Euro-Japanese Coperation</H4> 
<P>
Thanks to a grant from the Japan Foundation, the Institute has been able to
organize several conferences or workshops on the Euro-Japanese relations. In
1995, Prof. Carreras organized a conference on &quot;Historical Patterns of
Entrepreneur-ship and Management&quot;.
<BR> A Japanese assistant, Mr. Murashima was appointed in November 1995 to
strengthen the Japanese programme at the Institute and to take part in the
preparation of the Conference organised by Susan Strange on &quot;Globalisation
and Capitalist Diversity: Experiences on the Asian Mainland&quot; (May, 2-3-4
1996).

<CENTER><H1>The Project 1996-7<BR> The Political Economy of an Integrated Europe </H1></CENTER>
<HR>
<H2>Programme Directors:</H2>
<H3>Prof. Michael Artis, Department of Economics and Robert-Schuman Centre<BR>
Prof. Ramon Marimon, Department of Economics</H3>
<H2>The Research Project</H2>
<P>
The process of European economic unification involves the creation and
development of political and legal institutions, through which economic policy
will be designed, implemented and controlled. The design of these institutions
is the main object of the Maastricht Treaty and of many discussions in existing
European organizations: Intergovernmental Conference, European Parliament,
Ecofin, EMI, etc... The institutional and policy choices made in these coming
years will, to a large extent, determine whether this process will take place as
planned and, if so, how economic life will develop in the Europe of the 21st
Century.
</P>
<P>
The 1996-97 European Forum will be a platform that brings together economists,
political scientists, historians, lawyers and policy makers with the aim of
providing an assessment of the economic consequences of alternative
institutional designs for the European Community.
</P>
<P>
The analysis of alternative institutional and policy designs is becoming even
more pressing as we enter the &quot;final countdown for the European Monetary
Union&quot; and we recognize the persistent heterogeneity among European nations
and regions - specially when possible expansions are considered - and the
difficulties reforming the &quot;national&quot; welfare state within
self-imposed strict fiscal and monetary constraints. It is against this broader
background that, in spite of all its achievements, the Maastricht Treaty shows
its weaknesses and inconsistencies. Most of them, however, are only a reflection
of the difficulties with &quot;delegation and adaptation&quot;. That is, how
different policies (their development and/or implementation) are delegated to
different institutions (e.g., the national parliaments, the European Parliament,
the European Central Bank, etc.), and how these institutions adapt to new
developments (e.g., the possible integration of new members, an economic crisis,
etc.). Different contractual and institutional designs correspond to different
forms of delegation and adaptation.
</P>
<P>
The project of the European Union can be viewed as pursuing a delicate balance
between &quot;delegation&quot; of some policies (e.g. monetary policy) to
centrol European institutions (e.g. European Central Bank) while preserving many
national (and regional) policies (e.g. social transfers); a delicate balance
between having strict rules (e.g. the Maastricht convergence criteria) and the
need to &quot;adapt&quot; policies to new circumstances (e.g. the difficulty
starting the EMU on a stringent reading of the convergence criteria).
</P>
<P>
While all these issues are of current political debate, they are also the object
of academic analysis and scientific debate. There is a new interest, among
economists and political scientists, in Political Economy issues coming, on the
one hand, from the realization that economic policy design must take into
account the institutional and bargaining process in which policies must be
implemented, and on the other hand, from the recent developments in Game Theory,
Contract Theory and Dynamic Macroeconomic Theory that have provided the
necessary instruments for analyzing some of these issues. To a large extent, the
aim of the 1996-97 European Forum is to focus this renewed interest in Political
Economy issues on the problems of the &quot;Constitution of Europe&quot;.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, policy and institutional design must be rooted in an historial
perspective and, if possible, conclude with specific policy recommendations. It
is with this perspective that a reassesment of the process of European
Integration is also in order. Topics such as &quot;coordination of unemployment,
fiscal and monetary policies&quot;, &quot;persistent differences through the
business cycle&quot;, &quot;asymmetric effects of pollicies&quot;, &quot;consequences
of forming an EMU with 'ins' and 'outs', &quot;the reform of the 'national'
welfare state on the context of the EU&quot;, etc..., are some of the issues
that will be studied and debated in the 1996-97 European Forum.
</P>
<H2>The Programme of Activities (as of May 1996)</H2>
<P>
The Forum will hold a weekly seminar from October to June, and conferences.
</P>
<H3>Conference: The Macroeconomics of Unemployment</H3>
<P>
November, 1996 (dates to be determined)
<BR>
In collaboration with the Robert Schuman Centre
</P>
<H3>Conference: Economic Policy in an European Monetary Union
</H3>
<P>
December, 5th-7th, 1996 (dates to be confirmed)
<BR>
co-sponsored by the Centre for Economic Policy Research
</P>
<P>
The theme for this conference will be that of economic policy in the context of
a functioning European Monetary Union. Whilst the statutes of the European
Central Bank (ECB) have been approved as part of the Maastricht Treaty, there is
a great deal to do in terms of exploring the ramifications for the conduct of
policy. Three themes have been selected for exposure at the second conference of
the Forum: the question of the intermediate targets that the European Central
Bank will pursue and the instruments at its disposal to do so; the question of
the relationship between the &quot;ins&quot; and the &quot;outs&quot;; and the
question of the fiscal implications of a tight EMU with special reference to the
issue of national social welfare reforms.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty the European Monetary Institute (EMI)
has been given the remit - <I>inter alia</I> - of exploring the regulatory
framework and determining the set of instruments available to the ECB: this
conference will make an independent input into that exercise. At about the time
of the conference the EMI's latest evaluation of the convergence scenario will
have become available; this will form a suitable background for considering the
issue of the relationship between the members of a putative &quot;inner core&quot;
Monetary Union and the group of countries outside. Finally, the issue of social
welfare reforms is evidently the biggest fiscal issue on the agendas of the
European countries: the fiscal context provided by the the Monetary Union -
with, as it may be, some form of &quot;Waigel Pact&quot; - carries implications
for how this problem can be handled. The conference is expected to make a
contribution to clarifying thinking in this important and sensitive area.
</P>
<H3>Conference: Microeconomic Policy Interventions towards Unemployment
</H3>
<P>
April ,1997 (dates to be determined)
<BR>
In collaboration with the Robert Schuman Centre
</P>
<H3>Conference: The Political Economy of the European Union</H3>
<P>
Florence, June 3rd - 9th, 1997
<BR>
co-sponsored by the European Science Foundation 
</P>
<P>
This international conference will bring together political scientists and
economists studying the economic and political consequences of alternative
organizational designs for the European Union. The conference, as part of the
European Research Conferences of the ESF, will be the 1997 conference of the
by-yearly program on &quot;The Political Economy of Economic Policy&quot;,and,
as part of the 1996-97 European Forum of the EUI, will be the final conference
of the program.
</P>
<P>
The topics of the conference will range from specific EU topics, such as &quot;Analysis
of voting and institutional procedures&quot; as described in the Maastricht
Treaty and the subsequent work of the 1996 IGC Conference to more general issues
such as &quot;Economic efficiency and multigovernment representative democracies&quot;
or &quot;Coalition formation within a Union&quot;.
</P>
<P>
In addition to European Forum professors and visitors, around thirty visiting
scholars are expected to participate in this conference, as well as some
advanced graduate students.
</P>
<H3>Workshop: European Integration: The Political and Institutional Deficits</H3>
<P>
Dates to be determined
<BR>
In collaboration with the EUI Department of Social and Political Sciences, and
organised by Professor Colin Crouch.
</P>
<P>
Until now European Integration measures have been more easily able to achieve
market reforms than other aspects of integration. The original vision, which
incorporated social and even foreign policy goals, became mainly a Common
Market. In turn, achievement of the Single Market proved to be far easier than
that of the Social Dimension and other parts of the Treaty of Maastrich. Now,
while monetary integration is being modelled on the pattern of the Bundesbank,
there are no plans to accompany it by other economic and social institutions
which have over the years enabled the German economy to smooth its adjustments
to the rigours of the Bundesbank's stance.
</P>
<P>
The workshop will study in depth the relationship between progress with, on the
one hand, the creation of markets, and on the other the erection of political,
social and economic institutions of various kinds (e.g. financial system,
industrial relations system, regulatory and standard systems, welfare state,
foreign and defence policy).

As the century draws to a close, migrations have returned as a major challenge
to the developed nation-States of the West, especially in Europe. These
migrations defy neat categorization: economic migration, which is voluntary and
driven by the incentives of globalization, can no longer be easily distinguished
from ethnic homeland migration, in which whole categories of people are forced
to move because of violent regime breakdowns, war, or conquest. What are the
causes of contemporary international migrations? How do contemporary migrations
differ from past migrations? what are the political and social impacts on the
receiving societies? Are European societies being transformed into &quot;immigrant
societies&quot; like the United States, Canada, or Australia?
</P>
<P>
The European Forum on &quot;International Migrations&quot; is devoted to
tackling these questions from a broad historical comparative and
cross-disciplinary perspective. Three themes will receive special attention.
</P>
<H3>(1) The Phenomenology and History of Migrations</H3>
<P>
How do current migrations differ from, past migrations? What are the spatial
distribution, temporal trajectory, and phenomenology of migrations, past and
present? What difference does the absence or presence of a fully established
nation-State system make? A historical perspective allows us to throw stronger
light on the distinct contours of contemporary migrations.
</P>
<H3>(2) Migrations in the Modern State System</H3>
<P>
What are the determinants of immigration policies, both nationally and
transnationally? How do States reconcile the conflicting imperatives of
respecting the rights of refugees, restricting access to territory, and keeping
borders sufficiently permeable for the transactions of a global economy? Special
attention will be given to the relationship between immigration control and
asylum policy, and to attempts at transnational regime building in this area
(EU, NAFTA).
</P>
<H3>(3) The Rights of Migrants and Immigrant Integration</H3>
<P>
Once admitted, migrants have to be integrated into the social, economic, and
cultural fabric of the host society. This raises a number of questions: where
are the rights of migrants situated, at the national and/or transnational
levels? Is postnational (&quot;resident alien&quot;) membership a permanent
alternative to, or a temporary deviance from, national citizenship; Is the
multicultural recognition of difference a mechanism of, or an obstacle to,
integration? Special attention will be given to the study of &quot;difficult&quot;
migrant groups: Muslims in Europe, Hispanics in the United States.
</P>
<H2><A NAME="programme">The 1997-8 Preliminary Programme of Activities (Schedule as 15-05-1996)
</A>
</H2>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Forum will be organized around one regular weekly seminar and a series of
workshops and conferences to which additional scholars will be invited. These
are the workshop/conference themes:
</P>
<H3>14 October - Inaugural talk</H3>
<P>
General introduction by a chosen outstanding academic and/or politician on the
issue.
</P>
<H3>25-26 October - Conference: Migrations in a Historical Comparative
Perspective </H3>
<P>
Comparison of contemporary with past migratory movements; territorial,
political, and social dynamics of contemporary migrations; typology of
migrations; identifying migrants.
</P>
<H3>6 December - Workshop: Jewish Migration</H3>
<P>
Jewish migrations and mobility in a historical perspective (19th-20th century,
with special attention to post-World War II Jewish displacements).
</P>
<H3>21-22 February- Conference: Migrants in the Context of Globalization
</H3>
<P>
National responses to the second wave of post-war migrations; comparing
immigration and refugee arrangements across time and nations; emergent
transnational migration systems (EU, NAFTA); migrations in the contemporary
State system.
</P>
<H3>9-10 May- Conference: The Rights of Migrants: Immigrant integration and
ethnic conflicts</H3>
<P>
Where are the rights of migrants situated at national and/or transnational
levels? Is postnational (&quot;resident alien&quot;) membership a permanent
alternative to, or temporary deviance from, national citizenship? National
models for integrating immigrants; multiculturalism; organization of immigrant
communities; Muslims in Europe.
</P>
<H3>20-21 June- Closing conference: Concluding assessment of the work of the
1997-8 Forum </H3>
<P>
The closing conference will bring together the project researchers and
institutional/political actors involved, to assess the work being done at the
Forum, the state of research and its linkage with contemporary European
concerns.

 The debate on the state and adequacy of economic research in Europe  which has
developed since the early 1980s has been conducted on  the basis of very few
facts. The purpose of this study is firstly  to give an account of the resources
devoted to economic research  at the national (for the E.C.) level and at the
European level  and secondly to give a picture, albeit a somewhat summary one, 
of the output from this activity. With the data gathered the authors  make some
comparison between European countries. Though no doubt  some of the measures
used will be subject to criticism,this account  should serve to stimulate a more
informed debate on the state  of economic research in Europe. It should also
provide some indication  as to how to achieve further progress in developing
economic research  at the European level.<BR>

</UL>
<H4>Eligibility </H4>
<UL>
<LI>A student must be a national of the United Kingdom and must have been
ordinarily resident in the UK for at least three years immediately preceding the
date of application for a studentship. Students who have already received a
State award for a postgraduate course (e.g. an MA) may nevertheless be

</LI>
</UL>
<H4>Grants </H4>
<UL>
<LI>The basic maintenance grant for the 1996/97 academic year is LIT. 1,653,
333 per month (Lit. 19,840,000 per annum) but is subject to a means tests in
respect of income, including that of spouse. 
</LI>
</UL>
<H4>Travel </H4>
<UL>
<LI>Students may claim, within certain limits, for any necessary daily
travelling expenses and the cost of one outward and return journey between their
UK home and the Institute at the beginning and end of the academic year. 
</LI>
</UL>
<H4><A HREF="insuranc.htm">Health Insurance</A> </H4>
<UL>
<LI>The Institute has negotiated a medical insurance policy with a Belgian
company and the DfEE pays the premiums for holders of United Kingdom
studentships except for those registered for the one year LL M programme. In
certain circumstances reciprocal health treatment is available in Italy. Details
of these may be obtained from the local office of the DHSS or from the DHSS
Overseas Branch, Newcastle-upon-Tyne NE 98 1XY.

<H1>The President of the Portuguese Republic<BR> H.E. Jorge Fernando Branco de
Sampaio,<BR> &quot;The Future of Europe&quot;</H1>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
Mr. President,<BR> Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
I am both honoured and pleased to be associated with the commemorations of the
twentieth anniversary of the European University Institute and to have the
opportunity to address an audience which is so interested in the European
construction process.
</P>
<P>
I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for your kind words which honour both
me and my country.
</P>
<P>
Before I continue, I would like to honour all those who work or have worked in
this Institute, contributing to a deeper knowledge of Europe in its political,
cultural, economic and social diversity.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the Vasco da Gama chair alone illustrates the importance
Portugal attaches to the Institute and to its study of the more relevant aspects
of our continent's integration process, suggesting ways to deepen it, securing
the progress, in short, of the ideals and values that guide us.
</P>
<P>
In this context I would like specifically to mention Emile No&euml;l, a close
colleague of Jean Monnet, the Secretary-General of the European Commission and
President of this Institute. His dedication to the European ideals, his capacity
for organization, his persistent action over the decades on behalf of a more
cohesive and more united Europe will always constitute a valuable source of
inspiration. His death last month has understandably put in mourning all those
like me who share his ideals.
</P>
<P>
Testifying to the vision of the founding fathers of the European integration
process, the idea of a European University inevitably arose in the immediate
post-war era. As with so many other initiatives its achievement was hampered by
the hesitations and contradictions inherent to the evolution of the European
project.
</P>
<P>
Although we may regret the fact that we have not advanced further in the
creation of a true multi-disciplinary University, free to extend the fields of
research to all areas of learning, we must acknowledge that in all respects the
balance of these twenty years is very positive. We have a unique, firmly
established centre for research and for the dissemination of knowledge regarding
the European integration process in its historical, political, social, economic
and legal perspectives.
</P>
<P>
This does not mean that we must be content with this &quot;acquis&quot;. The
dynamics of European integration, its constant and necessary deepening, and the
challenges facing us, certainly require that we should go further, overcoming
taboos and prohibitions that no longer make any sense.
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that it would be similarly beneficial if the various centres of
research and learning created within the European framework were to find ways of
achieving a closer, more efficient articulation among themselves; I also believe
that the Institute's greater involvement in the day to day life of the European
institutions would bring mutual benefits, increasing the degree of reciprocal
awareness and the capacity to respond to some of the important challenges facing
our democratic societies.
</P>
<P>
We must acknowledge that the European institutions have not been able to
generate the required &quot;popular enthusiasm&quot; for the &quot;European idea&quot;.
This is a serious problem of understanding, of accession and of participation
which we must face up to unambiguously unless we wish to see the essential
conditions of the European project crumble away into nothing.
</P>
<P>
Man, the citizen himself, will always be the origin,  the beneficiary and the
<EM>raison d'&ecirc;tre</EM> of all politics. In a constantly changing world,
science and its applications become fundamental agents of citizen's
participation and accession.
</P>
<P>
Democracy needs science. We either deepen continually the scientific bases of
our knowledge of nature, the human being and society whilst simultaneously
promoting a critical and participative spirit, or we will witness the slow but
inexorable destruction of the powers of argument and, with their disappearance,
the destruction of the legitimacy of the very order on which democratic society
is based.
</P>
<P>
If scientific and technological nature values and perceptions are not asserted
and circulated in layman's terms this will severely limit the ability to
represent reality. The options will then no longer be those that are most suited
to the times and the context we live in, and it will become increasingly
difficult to express an informed opinion on the events which are frequently
mentioned in the media.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has the financial means and programmes which can, in
articulation with its member States, strengthen the mechanisms of scientific
policy, support elementary and technological research, enhance its results and
launch initiatives to broadcast scientific culture on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
So, it is essential for the major priorities of these programmes to be guided by
principles that clearly encourage pro-science attitudes favorable to science in
its most fundamental aspects, and also allow for social sciences to find the
proper framework of articulation with other sciences.
</P>
<P>
The path to a Europe which is juster to its citizens and shows more solidarity
with the other peoples of this world cannot be found only in technical and
technological improvements: for in its dimension and its soul, whose origins are
rooted in the Renaissance and the Discoveries, lie the critical spirit,
verification through experimentation and scientific creation.
</P>
<P>
Europe must constantly adapt to the demands of the modern world and of progress.
It must successfully negotiate the crossroads at which it now stands,
unequivocally embarking on a mobilizing, participative political project.
</P>
<P>
These are the issues I intend to discuss with you today under the generic title &quot;The
Future of the European Union&quot;.
</P>
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
My vision of the future of the Union stems naturally from my point of departure:
seen from the westernmost point in Europe the principal problems of the European
crisis are perhaps influenced by distance.
</P>
<P>
In defence of this vision I can only recall what Machiavelli said when he stated
that you can see the valleys better from the mountain and the mountains from the
valleys, assuming that it is pertinent to this particular case in which we are
looking towards the centre from the periphery.
</P>
<P>
We are undergoing a period of crisis and a phase of transition in Europe, which
originated in the major changes caused by the overthrow of the communist regimes
of central and eastern Europe, by the unification of Germany and by the
breakdown of the Soviet Union, a crisis which is the result of the meaning, the
rapidity and the very unpredictability of these changes.
</P>
<P>
The end of communism brought to a close a century of wars and revolutions; the
end of the cold war radically altered Europe's international position; the
retreat and disappearance of the Soviet empire modified the political map of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The acceleration of history, marking the turning point initiated with the
profound changes in Europe after 1989, was in itself a factor of the crisis. Our
own conceptions and assumptions were questioned.
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, the crisis was reflected both in the process and in the models of
Community integration. The change in the frontiers of democracy in Europe, the
resurgence of Germany as the principal regional power and the end of the
division imposed by bipolar rivalry did in fact herald the end of a cycle in
European construction.
</P>
<P>
This turning point marked the start of a phase of transition, in which we sought
the best institutional models, forms and structures with which to reconstitute a
framework of stability and security in Europe.
</P>
<P>
This state of crisis naturally conditions political performance and also implies
a process of great fluidity that resists the establishment of a stable
framework.
</P>
<P>
We must inevitably recognize that Europe as it was during the cold war is no
longer the centre of international politics and that it has been relegated to
regional status where its importance will be defined on its own merits rather
than by the competition between the major foreign powers. Simultaneously, the
principal regional powers have recovered their political and strategic autonomy.
</P>
<P>
German reunification also contributed to reinforcing re-nationalization trends
which were already discernible in the policies of the principal European powers
and which carried to their ultimate consequences, could endanger the Community
integration process.
</P>
<P>
In this framework, the internal integration of Europe assumes a crucial
importance as on it depends the possibility of guaranteeing the increasing
weight of this same Europe within the context of international competitiveness
dominated by the emergence of large regional areas and by the globalization of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
We are, then, at a crossroads. The first stages of the European integration
process served to a great extent to settle the past, to rise above the
assumptions of war, of internal protectionism and of frontiers. What we also
require from it now is a contribution to build the future and encompass the new
realities of the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
The end to the old division of Europe and the democratic restoration of &quot;that
other Europe&quot; have created a rare opportunity to achieve the unification of
European democracies.  The dilemma mow facing European construction is how to
articulate the expansion of the Community frontiers with the process of economic
and monetary integration, knowing that regional stability calls for the
integration of central and eastern European countries which, if excluded, could
endanger the ultimate meaning of a true European union.
</P>
<P>
Maastricht represents the first attempt to respond to these problems. The Treaty
definitely halted the risks of fragmentation, reiterating member States'
commitment to the process of integration; it defined the formal milestones of
the transition period towards institutional reform and economic and monetary
union; it allowed for the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, the Treaty constitutes the reference framework for the changes
which are essential for the next cycle of European construction. The next three
years, the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference and institutional
reform the third phase of economic and monetary union and the enlargement to the
countries of central and eastern Europe will be crucial for the resolution of
the European crisis.
</P>
<P>
All these issues will require an enhanced guidance and decision-making capacity
on behalf of political leaders in order to overcome the difficulties and
obstacles which have multiplied along the path to European integration.
</P>
<P>
I believe it is necessary at this point to reiterate that the aim of integration
must continue to be political and strategic, in which the economic and social
dimensions are in the last resort the tools needed to ally democratic stability
to regional security as the relevant factors of modernization and progress.
</P>
<P>
One cannot say it too often: European construction needs a political aim. Europe
cannot squander its time discussing its own organization at the risk of becoming
an abstraction. Europe cannot restrict itself to economic integration nor to
nominal convergence. The Europe we wish to have above all requires not only
consumers but citizens.
</P>
<P>
The first <EM>raison d'&ecirc;tre</EM> of the European project is to guarantee
peace between the States of Europe within a framework of consolidation of
democracies. Making war unthinkable was and continues to be our constant
purpose.
</P>
<P>
The second <EM>raison d'&ecirc;tre</EM> of European construction is to fortify
its member States; only this will justify the collective partition of
sovereignties as a way of ensuring internal stability and the reinforcement of
our external position.
</P>
<P>
The third reason is the formation of a hitherto unheard-of body in international
relations, a &quot;civil power&quot;, a space where States abide the principles
of the law both internally and as regards their mutual relations. It is a vital
element in the definition of European identity, synonymous with democracy and
the rule of law, the touchstone in the formation of an international society.
</P>
<P>
The fourth reason for the European project involves the scope of joint economic
development which tends permanently to correct asymmetries, guarantee a space
for balanced progress between the various regions of Europe, congregate the
commitment and participation of citizens. In short, the scope of European
cohesion and solidarity without which there can be no project of integration
worthy of that name.
</P>
<P>
And, as the background for the way in which we think and feel, as the &quot;reason
above all reasons&quot;, is our common cultural matrix, whose expressions are
various but which is rooted in the same attachment to the values of freedom,
democracy, respect for the inalienable rights of human beings, democratic rule
of law and solidarity. A cultural matrix which, naturally, does not exclude but
rather is enriched by the individual identities and the variety characterizing
Europe.
</P>
<P>
As I have already said, I believe that we must reaffirm the political nature and
the strategic importance of European construction.
</P>
<P>
Only then will we be able to define clearly its significance, so often submerged
in exotic and irrelevant debates on the institutional architecture or the
mathematics of monetary convergence which make the meaning of the future of the
European Union totally incomprehensible for the citizens.
</P>
<P>
I believe we have reached the moment to do away with esoteric discussions.
European construction requires the active participation of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
For this we require transparency, a strict definition of objectives, proximity,
dialogue, clarity of intentions with its so often attendant sacrifices, replies
to the ever-increasing anxieties in the day to day life of common man when he is
confronted with the spectre of unemployment, exclusion and social
marginalisation vis-&aacute;-vis himself or his children.
</P>
<P>
I believe that the first condition to overcome the crisis of the European Union
is to make a clear affirmation of its political and strategic aims. Only then
will it be possible to fulfil a suitable guiding mission, so essential in these
uncertain times in which the paths of the future are obscured.
</P>
<P>
It is a vision which is indispensable in order to respond to the lack of
interest and the anxieties of citizens and to the growing resistance to the
development of the integration process, ever-present in our States, and which
can seriously endanger the internal political consensuses necessary to pursue
European construction.
</P>
<P>
A second condition lies in institutional reforms. It is imperative to overcome
the deadlocks and obstructions that characterise the Community decision-making
process. At stake on the one hand is the efficacy and credibility of common
policies and, on the other, the means of participation of the elected
representatives when defining such policies.
</P>
<P>
Also at stake is the preparation of institutions for the reality of enlargement,
articulating the imperatives of efficacy with the insurmountable principle of
equality among member States, the cornerstone of the process of European
integration.
</P>
<P>
Institutional reform will, naturally, have to respect the rule of flexibility at
the risk of causing the paralysis of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
However, flexibility has limits, and the multiplication of formulas relating to
the constitution of &quot;hard cores&quot;, &quot;concentric circles&quot; and &quot;variable
geometries&quot; not only contributes to obfuscate the debate but may also cause
irreversible fractures.
</P>
<P>
My friends: let us be conscious that the creation of needless divisions is
certainly the worst way to unify Europe.
</P>
<P>
A third condition to overcome the crisis lies in the so-called dilemma between
deepening and enlargement. May I say right away that I do not like the word
dilemma. It bears the stigma of immobility. Certainly there is a dilemma but
what is important is how to overcome it.
</P>
<P>
We may enhance deepening, the sine qua non condition of the solidity and
stability of the European construction process, but we cannot avoid or ignore
enlargement; it is, insuperably, here, the requisite answer to the aspirations
of all those who legitimately aspire to share progress, stability, democratic
security, in short, to share our common project, without which Europe would not
be Europe.
</P>
<P>
Both the intensification of relations between the member States and the
expansion of the frontiers of the European Union are necessary. But both require
substantial resources whose availability is curtailed by the fact that we are
undergoing a period of economic stagnation and experiencing a crisis of the
European social model.
</P>
<P>
Economic and monetary union was conceived as a lever for change, as a decisive
instrument in altering the cycle of European construction, likely to create on
its own the bases of a new model of political and institutional organization.
But this strategy is vulnerable in ways that we cannot conceal and also entails
serious risks with regard to the future indispensable cohesion of the Union.
However, it is no use retreating: the degree of convergence already attained and
the efforts made to attain it would advise against such a move whose costs would
certainly be considerable.
</P>
<P>
However, European construction cannot be held hostage to economic and monetary
union and cannot achieve it outside social reality. EMU must be made compatible
with the institutional organization of the Union and with economic and social
cohesion in order not to run the risk of becoming an end in itself, on the road
to self-paralyze legitimate desires and which will stand up effectively to the
false prophets who multiply in times of crisis, to corporative interests and 
base ambitions.
</P>
<P>
To find suitable ways to overcome the crisis Europe must re-encounter its
fundamental values of solidarity, participation and civic responsibility, it
must finally and fully resume its humanist vocation and its universalist
tradition.
</P>
<P>
Only then may we embark confidently on the next cycle of European construction,
a cycle that must be marked by the intensification of relations between the
member States and the enlargement of the Union to all European democracies.
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, I am convinced this will happen; and I tell you that I have
confidence in the future of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Thank you.

<H1>Notes for the President's Speech on the Occasion of the Portuguese
President's Visit to the European University Institute<BR>
Wednesday, 25 September</H1>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
Mr. President,
<P>
We are greatly honoured by your visit here today and by the fact
that you have been able to come, inspite of your heavy working
schedule, in the first months of your term of office. We do believe
that your presence here shows the strength of your commitment
to the European ideals, which lie so much at the very heart of
the European University Institute's creation and existence. Portugal,
although one of the latest countries to join the Institute, has
always been one of its strongest supporters and has given, from
the start, a valuable contribution which far exceeds the size
of the country. It has sent us excellent research students who
have not only produced theses of high quality but in just a few
years have gone on to distinguish themselves in Portuguese public
and university life.
<P>
There can be no better demonstration of this than the fact that
you yourself have brought along former students of the EUI, who
are now the President of the Institute for National Defence Studies,
a member of the staff of the Minister for Industry and a member
of your own staff. One should also not forget that you have left
behind in Portugal a Member of Parliament, the Director of the
Portuguese National Library and several professors whose publications
at home and abroad have brought distinction both to themselves
and to the Institute.
<P>
This year, for the first time, we also have a Portuguese professor,
Professor Jaime Reis, who is one of the most distinguished economic
historians in the world and who in just a few months has gained
enormous appreciation and respect from researchers and colleagues
alike.
<P>
There is also one particular feature of Portugal's contribution
to the EUI which deserves to be singled out. This is the Vasco
da Gama Chair, the only one in the EUI to have been instituted
by a government of one of the Member States. Since 1991, when
the Chair was first filled, the resulting work has been truly
splendid. Under the guidance of Professor Kirti Chaudhuri a number
of very interesting theses have been or are being produced on
topics concerning European expansion, by researchers both Portuguese
and of other European nationalities. 
<P>
The EUI values these contributions very highly and would like
to think that when, in 1999, this chair ends its initial period,
the Portuguese authorities will recognize the importance of its
existence and continue to fund it for a second period. In the
16th century, the Portuguese created a University at Goa where
the Science of the West met the Science of the East. In the 20th
century, it is truly wonderful that Portugal should continue to
encourage this spirit of multiculturalism in science, and there
could be no better way of doing this than to maintain the Chair,
which was after all named after the navigator who, five centuries
ago, opened the way for such exchanges by discovering the sea
route to India. As 1998 approaches the 500th Anniversary of Vasco
da Gama's discovery of the Cape Route, we are in touch with the
National Commission for Portuguese Discoveries for celebrating
the event and we would warmly like to thank the Commission for
the support they have given us and the splendid work which they
are doing in the field of Portuguese expansion.
<P>
We have also welcomed with particular satisfaction the recent
decision of Portugal to recognize full legal value to the doctorates
issued by the Institute.
<P>
As you know, in the past 20 years, the European University Institute
has grown and consolidated to the point of becoming one of the
largest and most prestigious institutions for research and doctoral
training in Europe. Its buildings, made available by the Italian
Government at San Domenico di Fiesole, today house some 450 researchers,
45 professors and 30 Jean Monnet Fellows. With some 67 doctoral
theses successfully defended during 1995 before international
juries, the European University Institute has become the postgraduate
institution conferring the largest number of research doctorates
in Europe in the area of the social sciences.
<P>
Today, after 20 years of activity, the European University Institute
is willing and ready to strengthen its contribution to the debate
on European integration.
<P>
As well as its research interests in matters internal to the European
Union, the Institute has been very active with wider research
projects concerning, for example, Central and Eastern Europe and
even Caucasia. We now feel that new fields should be explored;
e.g., the Mediterranean, where a major problem of understanding
and of cultural dialogue still exists, something well suited to
the Institute's mission.
<P>
We do hope that the Portuguese Government will, as always in the
past, continue to support our activities and enable us to accomplish
our mission as enthusiastically and fruitfully as in the past.

<H1>IL PORTOGALLO E L'ISTITUTO UNIVERSITARIO EUROPEO</H1>
<P>
Dall'adesione del Portogallo nel 1989 alla convenzione che, nel 1976, ha creato
l'Istituto Universitario Europeo, hanno conseguito il titolo di Dottorato
dell'Istituto (PhD) 11 ricercatori portoghesi nelle aree di Storia, Economia e
Legge, alcuni dei quali dirigono attualmente alcune istituzioni portoghesi come
la Biblioteca Nazionale o l'Istituto di Difesa Nazionale.
</P>
<P>
Nel marzo del presente anno, il titolo di Dottore di ricerca (PhD), dato
dall'IUE &egrave; stato riconosciuto dal Ministero dell'Educazione,
equiparandolo automaticamente a quello attribuito nelle universit&agrave;
portoghesi.
</P>
<P>
La presenza di ricercatori portoghesi nell'IUE &eacute; cresciuta da quando il
Portogallo ader&igrave; all'Istituto; attualmente sono venti i ricercatori
portoghesi che vi lavorano, sette dei quali nel primo anno, distribuiti nei
dipartimenti di Storia, Legge, Economia e Scienze Sociali e Politiche.
</P>
<P>
Il Portogallo compartecipa al finanziamento dell'Istituto e sostiene totalmente
i costi della cattedra <A HREF="http://www.iue.it/HEC/Welcome.html#chau">Vasco
da Gama</A> dedicata allo studio della Espansione europea, attraverso un accordo
stipulato con la Commissione per la commemorazione delle scoperte portoghesi.
Diversi ricercatori europei studiano le scoperte portoghesi nell'ambito dei
lavori di questa cattedra.
</P>
<P>
Il corpo docente dell'IUE &eacute; formato da specialisti provenienti dalle pi&ugrave;
prestigiose universit&agrave; del mondo. Dall'inizio dell'anno, l'Istituto ha un
Professore portoghese nel dipartimento di Storia:
<A HREF="http://www.iue.it/HEC/Welcome.html#reis">Jaime Reis</A>, specialista
in Storia Economica. 
</P>
<P>
Dal 1993 l'Istituto offre corsi di lingua portoghese ai ricercatori interessati.
Questi corsi fin dall'inizio hanno avuto un elevato grado di partecipanti.
Annualmente &eacute; concessa dall'Istituto Cam&otilde;es una borsa di studio
per l'approfondimento della conoscenza della lingua. 
</P>
<P>
L'Istituto &eacute; stato visitato da importanti personalit&agrave; portoghesi
come l'ex-Presidente della Repubblica M&aacute;rio Soares, l'ex-Primo-Ministro
Cavaco Silva, i Commissari Vasco da Gra&ccedil;a Moura e Ant&oacute;nio
Hespanha, Professori come Francisco Lucas Pires, Armando Marques Guedes, Almeida
Costa e Maria Carrilho.

<H1>Il Presidente della Repubblica del Portogallo,<BR> S.E. Jorge Fernando
Branco de Sampaio,<BR> &quot;Il Futuro dell'Unione Europea&quot;</H1>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
Signor Presidente,<BR> Signore e Signori,
</P>
<P>
E' per me al tempo stesso un onore e un piacere trovarmi qui in occasione delle
celebrazioni per il ventesimo anniversario dell'Istituto Universitario Europeo e
avere l'opportunit&#136; di rivolgermi ad un uditorio particolarmente
interessato al processo di costruzione europea.
</P>
<P>
Vorrei ringraziarla, Signor Presidente, per le sue gentili parole che onorano
sia me sia il mio paese.
</P>
<P>
Prima di proseguire, vorrei cogliere l'occasione per esprimere la mia stima nei
confronti di tutti coloro che lavorano o hanno lavorato in questo Istituto,
contribuendo ad una pi&ugrave; approfondita conoscenza dell'Europa in tutti i
suoi aspetti politici, culturali e sociali.
</P>
<P>
L'istituzione della cattedra Vasco da Gama gi&agrave; da sola testimonia
dell'importanza che il Portogallo attribuisce all'Istituto e alle sue ricerche
sui pi&ugrave; importanti aspetti del processo d'integrazione del nostro
continente, proponendo modi che ne consentano l'approfondimento e che, in breve,
assicurino il progresso degli ideali e dei valori che ci guidano.
</P>
<P>
In questo contesto, vorrei ricordare in particolare Emile No&euml;l, uno stretto
collaboratore di Jean Monnet, Segretario Generale della Commissione Europea e
Presidente di questo Istituto. La sua dedizione agli ideali europei, le sue
capacit&#136; di organizzazione, la sua costante azione nel corso dei decenni a
favore di un'Europa pi&ugrave; coesa e pi&ugrave; unita rappresenteranno sempre
una preziosa fonte di ispirazione. La sua morte il mese scorso ha
comprensibilmente addolorato tutti coloro che come me condividono i suoi ideali.
</P>
<P>
A riprova dell'ampiezza di vedute dei padri fondatori del processo di
integrazione europea, l'idea di un'universit&#136; europea si present&#152;
inevitabilmente nel periodo immediatamente postbellico. Come nel caso di
numerose altre iniziative, la sua messa in atto fu ritardata dalle esitazioni e
dalle contraddizioni insite nell'evoluzione del progetto europeo.
</P>
<P>
Sebbene ci si possa rammaricare di non aver progredito ulteriormente verso la
creazione di un'Universit&agrave; genuinamente multidisciplinare, libera di
estendere le proprie ricerche a tutti i campi della conoscenza, dobbiamo
riconoscere che da tutti i punti di vista il saldo di questi venti anni di
attivit&#136; &#143; estremamente positivo. Noi qui disponiamo di un eccellente
e affermato centro di ricerche e di disseminazione delle conoscenze sul processo
di integrazione europea, nei suoi aspetti storici, politici, economici e
giuridici.
</P>
<P>
Questo non significa che dobbiamo accontentarci di tale &quot;acquis&quot;. La
dinamica dell'integrazione europea, il suo costante e necessario approfondimento
e le sfide che ci attendono, richiedono senza dubbio che ci si spinga pi&#157;
lontano, superando tab&#157; e divieti che non hanno pi&#157; alcun senso.
</P>
<P>
Sono convinto che sarebbe utile anche che i diversi centri di ricerca e
insegnamento creati all'interno del quadro europeo trovassero modi per
raggiungere tra loro forme di cooperazione pi&ugrave; strette ed efficienti;
credo anche che un maggior coinvolgimento dell'Istituto nella vita delle
istituzioni europee porterebbe benefici all'uno e alle altre, rafforzando il
grado di conoscenza reciproca e la capacit&#136; di risposta ad alcune delle pi&ugrave;
importanti sfide che le nostre societ&agrave; democratiche devono affrontare.
</P>
<P>
Dobbiamo riconoscere che le istituzioni europee non sono state in grado di
generare il necessario &quot;entusiasmo popolare&quot; per l'&quot;idea europea&quot;.
Si tratta di un serio problema di comprensione, adesione e partecipazione che
dobbiamo affrontare senza ambiguit&agrave;, se non vogliamo che le condizioni
essenziali del progetto europeo si frantumino e svaniscano.
</P>
<P>
L'uomo, il cittadino stesso, sar&agrave; sempre l'origine, il beneficiario e la
<I>raison d'&ecirc;tre</I> di tutta la politica. In un mondo in continua
trasformazione, la scienza e le sue applicazioni divengono fattori fondamentali
per la partecipazione e l'adesione dei cittadini.
</P>
<P>
La democrazia ha bisogno della scienza. O noi approfondiamo senza sosta le basi
scientifiche della nostra conoscenza della natura, dell'essere umano e della
societ&agrave;, promuovendo al tempo stesso uno spirito che stimoli la critica e
la partecipazione, oppure noi assisteremo ad una lenta ma inesorabile
distruzione dei poteri della libera discussione e, con la loro scomparsa, alla
distruzione della legittimit&agrave; di quello stesso ordine sul quale la societ&agrave;
democratica si fonda.
</P>
<P>
Se i valori e le modalit&agrave; scientifiche e tecnologiche di percepire la
natura non vengono riaffermate con forza e diffuse in termini comprensibili a
tutti i cittadini, questo porr&agrave; un serio ostacolo alle possibilit&agrave;
di rappresentare la realt&agrave;. Le opzioni a nostra disposizione allora non
saranno pi&#157; quelle che meglio si adattano ai tempi e ai contesti in cui
viviamo, e diverr&agrave; sempre pi&ugrave; difficile esprimere un'opinione
informata su tutti gli eventi spesso menzionati dai mass media.
</P>
<P>
L'Unione Europea dispone dei mezzi finanziari e dei programmi in grado, in
collaborazione con i suoi stati membri, di rafforzare i meccanismi delle
politiche scientifiche, di sostenere lo sviluppo della ricerca di base ed
applicata, di valorizzare i suoi risultati e di lanciare iniziative per la
diffusione su vasta scala della cultura scientifica.
</P>
<P>
E' dunque essenziale che questi programmi siano innanzitutto guidati da principi
che chiaramente incoraggino atteggiamenti a favore della scienza, in tutti i
suoi aspetti fondamentali, e che anche permettano alle scienze sociali di
trovare l'ambito pi&#157; appropriato per una collaborazione con le altre
scienze.
</P>
<P>
La strada verso un'Europa che sia pi&ugrave; giusta con i propri cittadini e
mostri pi&ugrave; solidariet&agrave; nei confronti degli altri popoli del mondo
non pu&ograve; essere trovata soltanto nel progresso tecnico e scientifico:
perch&eacute; nel cuore della sua grandezza e del suo spirito, le cui origini
trovano le proprie radici nel Rinascimento e nelle Scoperte, si trova lo spirito
critico, la verifica tramite la sperimentazione e la creazione scientifica.
</P>
<P>
L'Europa deve costantemente adattarsi alle esigenze del mondo moderno e del
progresso; deve risolvere con successo i nodi cruciali che l'attendono,
impegnandosi senza equivoci in un progetto politico di grande mobilitazione e
partecipazione.
</P>
<P>
Questi sono i temi che intendo discutere con voi oggi, sotto il generico titolo,
&quot;Il futuro dell'Unione Europea&quot;.
</P>
<P>
Signore e Signori,
</P>
<P>
La mia visione del futuro dell'Unione si sviluppa naturalmente dal suo punto di
partenza: osservati dal suo punto pi&ugrave; occidentale in Europa, i principali
problemi della crisi europea subiscono forse l'influenza della distanza.
</P>
<P>
In difesa di questo punto di vista posso forse ricordare quello che disse
Machiavelli quando sosteneva che puoi vedere meglio le valli dalla cima della
montagna e le montagne dal fondo della valle, se vogliamo accettare che la
metafora si adatti a questo caso particolare nel quale noi guardiamo al centro
dalla periferia.
</P>
<P>
In Europa stiamo attraversando un periodo di crisi e una fase di transizione che
hanno avuto origine dalle profonde trasformazioni causate dalla caduta dei
regimi comunisti nell'Europa centrale ed orientale, dalla riunificazione della
Germania e dalla dissoluzione dell'Unione Sovietica; si tratta di una crisi che
&#143; il risultato del significato, della rapidit&#136; e della imprevedibilit&#136;
di queste trasformazioni.
</P>
<P>
La fine del comunismo ha portato a conclusione un secolo segnato da guerre e
rivoluzioni; la fine della guerra fredda ha radicalmente modificato la
collocazione internazionale dell'Europa; la resa e la scomparsa dell'impero
sovietico hanno cambiato la mappa politica del continente.
</P>
<P>
L'accelerazione della storia, che segna la svolta che ha avuto inizio con le
profonde trasformazioni avvenute in Europa dopo il 1989, era essa stessa un
fattore della crisi. Le stesse nostre idee e i nostri presupposti sono stati
messi in questione.
</P>
<P>
Era inevitabile che la crisi si riflettesse sia sul processo sia sui modelli
dell'integrazione europea. La trasformazione nelle frontiere della democrazia in
Europa, il ritorno della Germania nel suo ruolo di principale potenza regionale
e la fine della divisione imposta dal confronto bipolare, hanno di fatto
annunciato la fine di un ciclo nel processo di costruzione europea.
</P>
<P>
Questo punto di svolta ha segnato l'inizio di una fase di transizione, nella
quale abbiamo cercato i migliori modelli, forme e strutture istituzionali con le
quali ricostituire un quadro di stabilit&#136; e sicurezza in Europa.
</P>
<P>
Questo stato di crisi naturalmente condiziona le possibilit&agrave; della
politica e implica anche una condizione di grande fluidit&agrave; che rende pi&ugrave;
difficile la creazione di un quadro stabile.
</P>
<P>
Siamo costretti a riconoscere che l'Europa, al contrario di quanto avveniva nel
corso della guerra fredda, non &egrave; pi&ugrave; il centro della politica
internazionale ed &egrave; stata relegata ad uno status regionale nel quale la
sua importanza verr&#136; definita sulla base dei suoi propri meriti, piuttosto
che sulla base della competizione tra le maggiori potenze straniere. Al tempo
stesso, le maggiori potenze della regione hanno recuperato la loro autonomia
politica e strategica.
</P>
<P>
La riunificazione tedesca ha anche contribuito al rafforzamento di quelle
tendenze alla ri-nazionalizzazione che erano gi&agrave; visibili nelle politiche
delle principali potenze europee e che se condotte sino alle loro estreme
conseguenze potrebbero mettere in pericolo il processo di integrazione
comunitaria.
</P>
<P>
In questo quadro, l'integrazione interna dell'Europa assume un'importanza
cruciale poich&eacute; da essa dipende la possibilit&agrave; di assicurare
all'Europa stessa un peso sempre crescente nel contesto della competitivit&agrave;
internazionale, dominata dall'emergere di grandi aree regionali e dalla
globalizzazione dell'economia.
</P>
<P>
Ci troviamo dunque a un bivio. Le prime fasi del processo di integrazione
europea sono servite in gran parte per sistemare il passato, per superare le
guerre, i protezionismi interni e le frontiere. Quello che noi richiediamo
adesso a tale processo &#143; un contributo per costruire il futuro e per farsi
carico delle nuove realt&#136; della fine del secolo.
</P>
<P>
Signore e Signori,
</P>
<P>
La fine della vecchia divisione dell'Europa e la restaurazione della democrazia
in &quot;quell'altra Europa&quot; ci offrono la rara opportunit&agrave; di
realizzare l'unione delle democrazie europee.
</P>
<P>
Il dilemma che oggi la costruzione europea deve affrontare &egrave; quello di
come coniugare l'espansione delle frontiere della Comunit&#136; con il processo
di integrazione economica e monetaria, sapendo che la stabilit&#136; del
continente richiede l'integrazione dei paesi dell'Europa centrale ed orientale,
poich&#142; una loro eventuale esclusione metterebbe in pericolo il significato
stesso di una vera unione europea.
</P>
<P>
Maastricht rappresenta il primo tentativo di dare una risposta a questi
problemi. Il Trattato ha dissolto con successo i rischi di frammentazione,
ribadendo l'impegno degli Stati membri a favore del processo di integrazione; ha
definito le tappe formali del periodo di transizione sulla strada verso la
riforma istituzionale e l'unione economica e monetaria; ha permesso l'adesione
di Austria, Finlandia e Svezia.
</P>
<P>
Da questo punto di vista, il Trattato rappresenta il quadro di riferimento per
le trasformazioni che sono essenziali per il prossimo ciclo della costruzione
europea. I prossimi tre anni, la conclusione della Conferenza Intergovernativa e
la riforma istituzionale, la terza fase dell'unione economica e monetaria, e
l'allargamento ai paesi dell'Europa centrale ed orientale, saranno cruciali per
la soluzione della crisi europea.
</P>
<P>
Tutte queste questioni richiederanno una rafforzata capacit&agrave; di
leadership e di guida da parte degli uomini politici europei, per poter superare
difficolt&agrave; ed ostacoli che si sono moltiplicati sulla via
dell'integrazione europea.
</P>
<P>
Credo che sia necessario a questo punto ribadire che lo scopo dell'integrazione
deve continuare ad essere politico e strategico, e che le dimensioni economiche
e sociali sono in ultima istanza gli strumenti necessari a coniugare la stabilit&#136;
democratica con la sicurezza regionale, quali fattori fondamentali per la
modernizzazione e il progresso.
</P>
<P>
Non smetteremo mai di ripeterlo: la costruzione europea necessita di un fine
politico. L'Europa non pu&ograve; perdere il suo tempo a discutere della propria
organizzazione con il rischio di divenire un'astrazione. L'Europa non pu&ograve;
limitarsi all'integrazione economica o a una convergenza nominale. L'Europa che
vogliamo ha bisogno innanzitutto non solo di consumatori ma di cittadini.
</P>
<P>
La prima <I>raison d'&ecirc;tre</I> del progetto europeo &egrave; di garantire
la pace tra gli Stati d'Europa, in un quadro di consolidamento delle democrazie.
Rendere la guerra inconcepibile era e continua ad essere nostra costante finalit&agrave;.
</P>
<P>
La seconda <I>raison d'&ecirc;tre</I> della costruzione europea &egrave; il
rafforzamento dei suoi Stati membri; solo questo giustificher&agrave; la
partizione collettiva delle sovranit&agrave; quale strumento per assicurare la
stabilit&agrave; interna e il rafforzamento della nostra posizione verso
l'esterno.
</P>
<P>
La terza ragione &egrave; la formazione di un'inedita istituzione nelle
relazioni internazionali, un &quot;potere civile&quot;, uno spazio in cui gli
Stati si attengono ai principi di legge sia al proprio interno sia nelle loro
relazioni reciproche. Si tratta di un elemento vitale nella definizione
dell'identit&#136; europea, sinonimo di democrazia e di stato di diritto, pietra
di paragone nella formazione di una societ&#136; internazionale.
</P>
<P>
La quarta ragione alla base del progetto europeo riguarda la finalit&#136; dello
sviluppo economico comune che tende costantemente a correggere le asimmetrie, a
garantire uno spazio per un progresso bilanciato delle diverse regioni
dell'Europa, ad aggregare l'impegno e la partecipazione dei cittadini. In breve,
la finalit&agrave; &egrave; quella della coesione e solidariet&agrave; europea
senza la quale non vi pu&ograve; essere progetto di integrazione degno di questo
nome.
</P>
<P>
E alla base del nostro modo di pensare e di sentire, come &quot;ragione al di
sopra di tutte le altre ragioni&quot;, vi &#143; la nostra comune matrice
culturale, le cui espressioni sono diverse ma che &#143; radicata nello stesso
attaccamento ai valori di libert&#136;, democrazia, rispetto per gli
inalienabili diritti degli esseri umani, stato di diritto e solidariet&#136;.
Una matrice culturale che naturalmente non esclude, ma &egrave; anzi arricchita
dalle identit&agrave; individuali e dalla variet&agrave; che caratterizzano
l'Europa.
</P>
<P>
Come ho gi&agrave; detto, sono convinto che dobbiamo riaffermare la natura
politica e l'importanza strategica della costruzione europea.
</P>
<P>
Solo cos&igrave; saremo in grado di definire chiaramente il suo significato, cos&igrave;
spesso dimenticato in dibattiti esoterici ed irrilevanti sull'architettura
istituzionale o sulla matematica delle convergenze monetarie, che rendono il
significato del futuro dell'Unione europea del tutto incomprensibile per i
cittadini.
</P>
<P>
Sono convinto che &egrave; giunto il momento di abbandonare le discussioni
esoteriche. La costruzione europea richiede l'attiva partecipazione dei suoi
cittadini.
</P>
<P>
Per questo abbiamo bisogno di trasparenza, di una precisa definizione degli
obiettivi, di vicinanza, di dialogo, di chiarezza nelle intenzioni a cui tanto
spesso si accompagna la necessit&#136; di sacrifici, di risposte alle crescenti
ansie che turbano la vita quotidiana dell'uomo comune quando si trova a dover
affrontare lo spettro della disoccupazione, dell'esclusione e della
marginalizzazione sociale per s&eacute; o per i propri figli.
</P>
<P>
Credo che la prima condizione per poter superare la crisi dell'Unione Europea
consista nel dichiarare chiaramente quali sono le sue finalit&#136; politiche e
strategiche. Solo in tal modo diverr&#136; possibile assumere il necessario
ruolo di guida, cos&quot; essenziale in questi tempi di incertezze nei quali le
vie del futuro appaiono oscure.
</P>
<P>
Si tratta di una prospettiva che &egrave; indispensabile per rispondere alla
mancanza di interesse e alle paure dei cittadini, e alle crescenti resistenze
nei confronti del processo di integrazione, sempre presenti nei nostri Stati,
che possono mettere in serio pericolo il consenso politico interno, necessario
alla realizzazione della costruzione europea.
</P>
<P>
Una seconda condizione risiede nelle riforme istituzionali. E' assolutamente
indispensabile superare i punti morti e gli ostacoli che caratterizzano il
processo decisionale comunitario. In gioco vi sono, da un lato, l'efficacia e la
credibilit&agrave; delle politiche comuni e, dall'altro, gli strumenti di
partecipazione a disposizione dei rappresentanti eletti nella definizione di
tali politiche.
</P>
<P>
In gioco vi &egrave; anche la preparazione delle istituzioni alla realt&#136;
dell'allargamento, dove gli imperativi dell'efficienza devono essere coniugati
con l'irrinunciabile principio dell'uguaglianza tra Stati membri, pietra
angolare del processo di integrazione europea.
</P>
<P>
Naturalmente, la riforma istituzionale dovr&agrave; rispettare regole di
flessibilit&agrave; per non correre il rischio di causare la paralisi
dell'Unione Europea.
</P>
<P>
Tuttavia, la flessibilit&agrave; deve conoscere dei limiti, e la moltiplicazione
di formule relative alla costituzione di &quot;nuclei duri&quot;, &quot;cerchi
concentrici&quot; e &quot;geometrie variabili&quot; non soltanto contribuisce a
rendere confuso il dibattito ma pu&#152; anche condurre a fratture
irreversibili.
</P>
<P>
Cari amici, dobbiamo essere ben consapevoli del fatto che la creazione di
inutili divisioni &egrave; senz'altro il modo peggiore per unificare l'Europa.
</P>
<P>
Una terza condizione per poter superare la crisi attuale &egrave; rappresentata
dal cosiddetto dilemma tra approfondimento e allargamento. Lasciatemi dire
subito che non amo la parola dilemma. Porta con s&eacute; i segni caratteristici
dell'immobilit&#136;. Vi &#143; senza dubbio un dilemma, ma importante &#143; il
modo in cui superarlo.
</P>
<P>
Possiamo far progredire l'approfondimento, conditio sine qua non della solidit&agrave;
e stabilit&agrave; della costruzione europea, ma non possiamo evitare o ignorare
l'allargamento; &egrave; qui ineludibilmente, ed &egrave; la risposta che
dobbiamo dare alle aspirazioni di tutti coloro che legittimamente desiderano
condividere progresso, stabilit&#136;, sicurezza nella democrazia, in breve,
condividere il nostro progetto comune, senza il quale l'Europa non sarebbe
l'Europa.
</P>
<P>
Sia l'intensificazione delle relazioni tra gli Stati membri, sia l'allargamento
delle frontiere dell'Unione Europea sono necessari. Tuttavia, entrambi
richiedono risorse notevoli la cui disponibilit&agrave; risulta ridotta a causa
del periodo economico di stagnazione che stiamo attraversando e della crisi del
modello sociale europeo.
</P>
<P>
L'unione economica e monetaria &egrave; stata concepita come leva al servizio
del cambiamento, come strumento decisivo per trasformare il ciclo della
costruzione europea, capace di creare da solo le basi per un nuovo modello per
l'organizzazione politica e istituzionale. Non possiamo nasconderci, tuttavia,
che tale strategia si presenta come vulnerabile e comporta anche dei rischi per
quanto riguarda il futuro dell'indispensabile coesione dell'Unione. Eppure &egrave;
inutile indietreggiare: il grado di convergenza gi&agrave; conseguito e gli
sforzi fatti per raggiungerlo, ci sconsigliano una mossa di questo genere i cui
costi sarebbero senza dubbio considerevoli.
</P>
<P>
Tuttavia, la costruzione europea non pu&#152; rimanere ostaggio dell'unione
economica e monetaria, n&#142; pu&#152; conseguire quest'ultima al di fuori
della realt&#136; sociale. L'UEM deve essere resa compatibile con
l'organizzazione istituzionale dell'Unione e con la coesione economica e
sociale, per non correre il rischio di divenire un fine in se stesso, sulla via
verso l'auto-paralisi.
</P>
<P>
Ripeto quello che ho solo accennato pi&ugrave; sopra: l'UEM richiede risorse -
risorse ingenti soprattutto di bilancio - per non trasformarsi in un'utopia
grottesca e in un fattore di divergenza e disgregazione all'interno dell'Unione.
</P>
<P>
Non dobbiamo dimenticarci che stiamo realizzando l'UEM in una situazione
economica e sociale di estrema vulnerabilit&agrave;, caratterizzata da una
profonda ristrutturazione dei settori produttivi, con le note conseguenze
sull'occupazione e con la comparsa di fenomeni di esclusione su vasta scala.
</P>
<P>
Le societ&agrave; europee tenderanno sempre pi&ugrave; ad assumere un carattere
pericolosamente dualistico, con la loro coesione interna indebolita e minacciata
da un'esclusione sociale di massa, mentre dall'altro lato si svilupper&#136; una
realt&#136; segnata dalla conquista della competitivit&#136; economica,
all'interno di un contesto di globalizzazione economica e di caduta delle
frontiere.
</P>
<P>
Si tratta forse della pi&ugrave; grande sfida e della pi&ugrave; seria minaccia
che le nostre societ&agrave; e l'Europa devono affrontare alla fine di questo
secolo. E deve essere affrontata come problema europeo, adottando politiche
incisive e determinate che utilizzino strumenti adeguati alla dimensione del
problema da risolvere.
</P>
<P>
L'allargamento &egrave; essenziale per garantire il consolidamento dei regimi
democratici dell'Europa centrale ed orientale, e per assicurare una stabilit&agrave;
che &egrave; minacciata da tensioni sociali ed etniche e da potenziali conflitti
militari, che metteranno in pericolo la sicurezza dell'Unione stessa. Gli
ammonimenti che ci vengono dalla tragedia dell'ex-Yugoslavia non possono essere
ignorati, e il modo migliore per rafforzare la sicurezza dell'Unione e la
stabilit&#136; dell'Europa centrale ed orientale &egrave; l'allargamento delle
frontiere dell'Unione.
</P>
<P>
Quello che &egrave; ancora pi&ugrave; importante, tuttavia, &egrave; che
l'unificazione delle democrazie europee &egrave; parte integrante del progetto
politico dell'Unione Europea, la cui legittimazione politica, quale struttura
fondamentale dell'Europa, verrebbe messa in forse se dovesse chiudere le proprie
porte alle nuove democrazie.
</P>
<P>
Come sempre accade, la questione essenziale &egrave; l'esistenza o meno di un
progetto politico. Questo progetto deve esistere se non vogliamo rinnegare
l'eredit&#136; dei &quot;padri fondatori&quot; e, soprattutto, se non vogliamo
rinnegare noi stessi.
</P>
<P>
E una dimensione politica per il progetto europeo richiede anche che non ci si
confini nella dimensione ristretta dell'Unione Europea, sebbene questa ne
rappresenti l'ancoraggio pi&ugrave; importante. Consiglio d'Europa, OSCE, UEO e
NATO sono strutture essenziali da cui partire per &quot;organizzare&quot;
l'Europa, per realizzare le condizioni adatte alla creazione di sfere
differenziate di integrazione che consentano di evitare la marginalizzazione di
Stati che sono indispensabili per la stabilit&agrave; del continente.
</P>
<P>
Sar&agrave; assolutamente indispensabile creare le condizioni per una pi&ugrave;
stretta cooperazione ed articolazione tra queste organizzazioni, superando se
possibile la limitante logica che ha sotteso la loro fondazione, e cercando di
realizzare un coerente insieme istituzionale che fornisca un valore aggiunto
rispetto alla semplice somma delle sue parti.
</P>
<P>
Quale Stato membro dell'Unione Europea e uno dei fondatori della NATO, il
Portogallo assicura il proprio impegno totale a favore degli sforzi diretti al
consolidamento dell'Europa come area di pace, libert&#136; e solidariet&#136;.
</P>
<P>
Cari amici,
</P>
<P>
Sono convinto che qualsiasi riflessione sul futuro dell'Unione Europea debba,
parafrasando Vaclav Havel, prendere avvio da una discussione sull'Europa quale
depositaria di valori comuni, sulla nostra identit&agrave; spirituale e
culturale, sul passato e il presente dell'Europa e su quello che pu&#152; o deve
essere in futuro.
</P>
<P>
Nella concezione che condividiamo, la base di ogni potere risiede nel cittadino,
l'uomo capace di pensiero che detiene la libert&#136; di espressione e di
scelta. Il processo di integrazione europea dovr&#136; sempre avere come
obiettivo la libert&#136; e la dignit&#136; dell'uomo, liberandolo dalla paura e
rafforzando le condizioni per l'esercizio dei suoi diritti di cittadinanza.
</P>
<P>
Liberarlo non solo dalla paura dell'altro uomo, dalla paura della guerra, ma
liberarlo anche dagli spettri del rifiuto sociale, dell'esclusione economica,
dell'intolleranza e del razzismo, le diverse forme di marginalizzazione che
affliggono le nostre societ&#136;.
</P>
<P>
Questa &egrave; l'essenza del progetto politico europeo. Un progetto che deve
costantemente mobilitare i cittadini, l'immaginazione e la creativit&agrave;. Un
progetto a cui concorreranno sempre pi&ugrave; persone. Un progetto che
soddisfer&agrave; legittimi desideri e che si opporr&#136; con successo ai falsi
profeti che si moltiplicano nei periodi di crisi, agli interessi corporativi e
alle spregevoli ambizioni.
</P>
<P>
Per trovare i mezzi adatti a superare la sua crisi, l'Europa deve recuperare i
suoi valori fondamentali di solidariet&#136;, partecipazione e responsabilit&#136;
civica, deve rifare proprie definitivamente e pienamente la sua vocazione
umanistica e la sua tradizione universalista.
</P>
<P>
Solo cos&igrave; potremo intraprendere con fiducia il prossimo ciclo della
costruzione europea, un ciclo che deve essere caratterizzato
dall'intensificazione delle relazioni tra gli Stati membri e dall'allargamento
dell'Unione a tutte le democrazie europee.
</P>
<P>
E' mia ferma convinzione che questo avverr&agrave;; e vi dico che ho fiducia nel
futuro dell'Unione Europea.
</P>
<P>
Vi ringrazio.

<H1>Appunti per il discorso del Presidente dell'IUE in occasione della visita
del Presidente del Portogallo,<BR> Mercoled&igrave;, 25 Settembre 1996</H1>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
Signor Presidente,
</P>
<P>
Siamo profondamente onorati della sua visita qui oggi, e del fatto che lei sia
stato in grado di venire, nonostante l'ingente carico di lavoro che deve
affrontare nei primi mesi del suo incarico. Siamo convinti che la sua presenza
qui dimostri l'intensit&#136; del suo impegno a favore degli ideali europei, i
quali sono intimamente legati alla nascita e alla vita dell'Istituto
Universitario Europeo. Il Portogallo, bench&eacute; uno tra gli ultimi Paesi ad
essere divenuto membro dell'Istituto, ci ha sempre offerto un sostegno
estremamente deciso e sin dall'inizio ha fornito contributi di grande valore,
ben pi&ugrave; che proporzionali alle dimensioni del Paese. Il suo Paese ci ha
inviato ricercatori che non soltanto hanno prodotto tesi di dottorato di alta
qualit&agrave;, ma che nel giro di pochi anni sono riusciti a farsi onore nella
vita pubblica ed universitaria del Portogallo.
</P>
<P>
Non vi pu&ograve; essere migliore dimostrazione di ci&ograve; che il fatto che
lei stesso ha firmato la nomina di ex-studenti dell'IUE a importanti incarichi:
il Direttore della Biblioteca Nazionale Portoghese, il Presidente dell'Istituto
di Studi per la Difesa Nazionale e un membro del suo stesso staff. E non bisogna
dimenticarsi che in Portogallo anche un Membro del Parlamento, un membro del
gabinetto del Ministero dell'Industria e numerosi professori, con le loro
pubblicazioni edite sia in Portogallo sia all'estero, onorano il nome
dell'Istituto.
</P>
<P>
Quest'anno, per la prima volta, abbiamo anche un professore portoghese, il Prof.
Jaime Reis, che &egrave; uno tra i pi&ugrave; famosi storici economici del
mondo, e che nel giro di pochi mesi &egrave; riuscito a farsi enormemente
apprezzare e stimare tanto dai ricercatori che dai colleghi.
</P>
<P>
Vi &egrave; un aspetto in particolare del contributo del Portogallo alla vita
dell'IUE che deve essere sottolineato. Si tratta della Cattedra Vasco da Gama,
l'unica dell'IUE ad essere stata istituita dal governo di uno degli Stati
Membri. Dal 1991, quando la Cattedra &#143; stata attribuita per la prima volta,
il lavoro svolto nel suo ambito si &#143; rivelato veramente eccellente. Sotto
la guida del Prof. Kirti Chaudhuri numerose tesi sono state preparate, o sono in
corso di preparazione, su argomenti riguardanti l'espansione europea, ad opera
di ricercatori sia portoghesi sia di altre nazionalit&agrave; europee.
</P>
<P>
L'IUE apprezza grandemente tale contributo e vogliamo sperare che quando, nel
1999, la Cattedra avr&agrave; concluso il suo periodo iniziale di vita, le
autorit&agrave; portoghesi riconosceranno l'importanza della sua esistenza e la
finanzieranno per una seconda fase. Nel sedicesimo secolo, i Portoghesi
fondarono un'Universit&#136; a Goa per fare incontrare la scienza dell'Occidente
con la Scienza dell'Oriente. Nel ventesimo secolo, &egrave; veramente magnifico
che il Portogallo voglia continuare a incoraggiare questo spirito di
multiculturalismo nella scienza, e non vi potrebbe essere modo migliore di farlo
che conservando in vita la Cattedra, che dopotutto porta il nome del navigatore
che, cinque secoli fa, apr&quot; la via alla possibilit&#136; di tali scambi
scoprendo la via marittima per l'India.
</P>
<P>
Abbiamo accolto con grande piacere anche la recente decisione del Portogallo di
riconoscere pieno valore legale al titolo di dottore di ricerca rilasciato
dall'Istituto.
</P>
<P>
Come lei sa, negli ultimi venti anni, l'Istituto Universitario Europeo &egrave;
cresciuto e si &egrave; consolidato sino a diventare una tra le pi&ugrave;
grandi e prestigiose istituzioni di ricerca e formazione dottorale in Europa. I
suoi edifici, resi disponibili dal Governo italiano a San Domenico di Fiesole,
ospitano oggi circa 450 ricercatori, 45 professori e 30 Jean Monnet Fellows. Con
qualcosa come 67 tesi di dottorato difese davanti a commissioni esaminatrici
internazionali, nel corso del 1995, l'Istituto Universitario Europeo &egrave;
divenuto l'istituzione post-universitaria che conferisce il pi&ugrave; alto
numero di dottorati di ricerca in Europa, nell'area delle scienze sociali.
</P>
<P>
Oggi, dopo vent'anni di attivit&agrave;, l'Istituto Universitario Europeo ha la
volont&agrave; e i mezzi per per dare un ancor maggior contributo al dibattito
sull'integrazione europea.
</P>
<P>
Ai suoi interessi di ricerca riguardanti argomenti interni all'Unione europea,
l'Istituto ha dinamicamente affiancato progetti di ricerca su un'area pi&#157;
vasta, riguardanti per esempio l'Europa centrale ed orientale e persino il
Caucaso. Siamo convinti che ora nuovi campi di ricerca debbano essere esplorati;
per esempio, il Mediterraneo, un'area nella quale ancora esistono gravi problemi
di comprensione reciproca e di dialogo interculturale: un compito del genere ben
si adatta alla missione culturale dell'Istituto.
</P>
<P>
Speriamo sinceramente che il Governo portoghese voglia, come sempre ha fatto in
passato, dare un valido sostegno alle nostre attivit&#136; e permetterci di
portare a compimento la nostra missione con lo stesso entusiasmo e lo stesso
successo che ci ha caratterizzati in passato.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"><H2>                      Letter of the President</H2>
<P>
   The 1996 Istanbul Congress was an impressive and enjoyable  occasion, notable
for the number of papers presented, the stunning  location overlooking the
Bosphorus, and the spectacular banquet at  the Beylerbeyi Palace after a moonlit
boat trip on the Bosphorus.  The student helpers made us particularly welcome,
and provided a  strong sense of academic community. With up to 26 parallel 
sessions, it was obviously impossible to sample more than a few,  but I was
struck both by the youth of many of the presenters and  their technical skill in
presentation, making good use of the  overhead projector. Judging by the
sessions I attended, standards of  presentation have considerably improved over
the last decade, no  doubt in large part due to the success of the Association
in  disseminating best practice.        </P>
<P>The 1997 Congress will be in Toulouse from 31 August to  2nd September
immediately following the European Meeting of the  Econometric Society. The
Programme Chairman is Philippe Jehiel  and the local organising Chairman is Marc
Ivaldi. The deadline for  receipt of papers is March 1 1997, and the web page
for the 1997  Toulouse Congress will be at http:\\www.idei.fr.  The President 
Elect, Reinhard Selten has chosen Economic Behaviour as the theme  of the
Congress and his address will be `Features of experimentally  observed bounded
rationality'.  Truman Bewley will give the  Marshall Lecture `There is no harm
in looking: a close look at wage  rigidity' and Werner Hildenbrand will give the
Schumpeter Lecture  `On aggregation of behaviour'.  </P>
<P>The 1998 Congress will be held at  Humboldt University Berlin with Prof. Dr.
Bengt-Arne Wickstroem  as the chair of the local organising committee.       
The Annual Congress is one of the main activities of the  Association, and we
are continually trying to improve its value and  success. This year, I appointed
Jean-Jacques Laffont to review the  organisation of the invited sessions, to see
in particular whether we  should move to a more open process following the model
of the  American Economic Association. If any of you have views on how  to
improve these sessions, you are warmly invited to write directly  to
Jean-Jacques Laffont at Toulouse.         </P>
<P>The success of any congress depends in large part on the  energy and
enthusiasm of the local organising committee, where the  most energetic and
enthusiastic are often the younger members. The  Council of the Association is
always anxious to hear of suggestions  for possible locations of future
congresses, and if you think that  your campus has the facilities and the
energetic support of the local  faculty, you should encourage the Faculty
Chairman to contact the  President or Secretary of the Association. At any
moment the next  two congresses have usually been decided, so we are thinking
three  or more years ahead, which may seem like a lifetime to a Graduate 
Student, but there is surely the satisfaction of raising the visibility  of your
University in the consciousness of the profession.                              
               </P>

<H4>'The Economic Constitution of the European Community: From &quot;Rome&quot;
to &quot;Maastricht&quot;'<BR> Manfred E. Streit and Werner Mussler </H4>
<P>
Abstract: The present paper analyzes, from an economic point of view, the
changes in the economic constitution of the European Community since its
foundation in 1958. In order to identify the various changes, we start by
developing an economic frame of reference. Our proposition is that the
constitution of the European Community (EC) came closest to this frame of
reference: an economic constitution for a market system. In the subsequent
parts, we try to show that the process of European integration was largely based
on the introduction of non-market elements. Our final argument will be that as
far as the economic constitution is concerned, the TEU is dominated by traits
which are characteristic of modern welfare states.

<H4>'Neo-Voluntarism: A New European Social Policy Regime?' <BR> Wolfgang
Streeck </H4>
<P>
Abstract: The essay begins with a recapitulation of core institutional
properties of the European Union as they have evolved over several decades. The
leading insight deriving from this exercise is that European social policy will
always, for all practical purposes, be made simultaneously at two levels, a
supranational one and a national one, and will be shaped by complex interactions
between them and among the national systems situated in the integrated market
economy of the Union. Proceeding from here, the remainder of the paper examines
the two levels of social policy-making, beginning with the supranational and
moving on to the national, in an effort to identify the kinds of policies that
are most likely to emerge given the constraints and opportunities offered by the
institutional framework. 
</P>
<H4>'Social Values and the Multiple Sources of European Social Law' <BR>
Silvana Sciarra </H4>
<P>
Abstract: The paper aims at describing the current status of European social
law, by examining different sources. These include the most recent directives;
the Protocol attached to the Maastricht Treaty; the Commission's latest White
papers on social policies and on economic growth and unemployment; and the case
law of the European Court of Justice. In such a variegated legal landscape, a
significant role could be played by non-binding measures; the notion of soft law
is slowly acquiring its own dignity in European social law and is emerging for
open interpretation. Yet, European labour law houses a fragile body of norms.
The spreading of social values would become a tangible prospect if the potential
of the multiple sources here examined were better exploited by all actors.
Although a coherent legal structure is still to come, a legal culture is being
created which should be strengthened through action by all Community
institutions.

<H3>Overview of the Law as it Stands: </H3>
<H4>'The Telecommunications Law of the European Union' <BR> Wolf Sauter </H4>
<P>
Abstract: This article is intended to give an overview of the law as it stands
on telecommunications at the Community level. Over the past ten years the
telecommunications law and policy of the European Community have developed
rapidly along the twin axes of liberalisation (deregulation) and harmonisation
(reregulation). The innovative use of Article 90 EC has been central to
liberalisation, while most harmonisation has been based on open network
provision (ONP) passed under Article 100a. The article concludes that, now the
national monopolies have been largely dismantled, new issues will arise in the
competitive mark

<H4>'Theoretical Perspectives on European Governance' <BR> Markus Jachtenfuchs
</H4>
<P>
Abstract: The paper reviews some theories of social science which could
contribute to the development of a concept of European governance going beyond
traditional notions, such as `federal states' or `international organisation'.
The theoretical argument is based on the culturalist version of
neo-institutionalism, which stresses the role of ideas in the functioning and
transformation of a political order. It is claimed that both globalisation and
functional differentiation transform existing nation-states and shape the
emerging European polity. European governance is characterised as poly-centric
and non-hierarchical. Finally, different approaches to the legitimation of such
a polity are discussed. The paper comes to the conclusion that the emergence of
a European political order is part of a process which could require a rethinking
of basic social scientific concepts.

<H4>'European Community Law and the Distribution of Regulatory Power in the
United Kingdom' <BR> Terence Daintith </H4>
<P>
Abstract: This paper draws on a series of case-studies of implementation of
specific Community law instruments, in the fields of food safety, toy safety,
beverage labelling, television broadcasting, and free movement of persons. The
objective is to explore the question of how, and to what extent, the need to
implement Community law and policy functions to reinforce or to retard shifts in
regulatory power in the United Kingdom: from local to central regulatory power;
from official regulation to self-regulation; and from bureaucratic and political
controls to privately-initiated control through the courts.

<H4>'The Collective Labour Law of the European Union' <BR> Brian Bercusson
</H4>
<P>
Abstract: The collective labour law of the European Union is embedded in a
variety of legal measures incorporating principles of collective labour law
reflecting national experience. The dynamic of its development has been the
spill-over effect of these principles, through their translation into the status
of EU law, and their development by decisions of the European Court of Justice.
The article outlines a framework of principles which, it is argued, are
currently embodied in the collective labour law of the EU. They include
collectively bargained labour standards, workers' collective representation,
workers' participation, and protection of strikers against dismissal. In
addition, there is a parallel principle of collective solidarity emerging in the
social security law of the EU. The principle of collective negotiation of labour
law introduced by the Protocol and Agreement on Social Policy may be seen as the
founding constitutional basis for the collective labour law of the European
Union. 
</P>
<H4>'Independent Agencies: Hierarchy Beaters?' <BR> Michelle Everson </H4>
<P>
Abstract: The business of modern government is efficient policy- formation,
regulation and implementation. In common with conventional Governments, the
European Union may be facing a serious mismatch between the increasingly
specialised functions of government and the administrative instruments at its
disposal. Arguably, independent European Agencies might aid in combatting this
mismatch, and in establishing efficient administration. Article 4 of the Treaty
of Rome seems severely to curtail the possible use of independent agencies
within Europe. Nevertheless, American constitutional experience may yet serve to
demonstrate how this barrier might be overcome in the European setting: the
development of novel and flexible means of governmental oversight might secure
the independence of European agencies, whilst at the same time laying renewed
emphasis upon traditional `constitutional' principles such as the control of
power and public accountability.

<H4>'Effective Legal Sanctions in EC Law: A Moving Boundary in the Division of
Competence' <BR> Angela Ward </H4>
<P>
Abstract: This article details and analyses the development of European Court of
Justice guidelines regarding sanctions provided by Member States to correct
infractions of EC law. It will be shown that the contemporary policy of the
Court significantly retreats from an early practice of non-interference with the
discretion of national judges to attach domestic remedies for breach of
substantive community measures. Preliminary comments will be made on the
possible impact of these developments on the constitutional structure of the
Community, and, in particular, their potential effect on the continuing debate
concerning the legitimacy of EC rules.

<H4>'Does Europe need a Constitution? Reflections on Demos, Telos and the
German Maastricht Decision',<BR> J.H.H. Weiler</H4>
<P>
Abstract: Through a close reading of the Maastricht Decision of the German
Federal Constitutional Court Weiler examines critically the so&#173;called No&#173;Demos
Thesis according to which the absence of a European Demos precludes
democratisation of the Union at the European level and requires the mediation of
Member State institutions. He traces the roots of this thesis to Carl Schmitt
and argues that it represents a failure of the Court to understand the Union in
terms different from the Schmittian strand in German constitutional theory. He
claims, inter alia, that the No Demos thesis is premised on an organic
understanding of peoplehood deriving from the European Nation&#173;State
tradition which conflates nationality and citizenship and can, as a result,
conceive of Demos only in statal terms. Weiler first presents an alternative
view of the Union and of supranationalism and then offers a non organic view of
Demos and argues for a `European' notion of membership in which each individual
would belong to multiple demoi defined in different ways. 
</P>
<H4>'The Maastricht-Urteil: Sovereignty Now',<BR> Neil MacCormick</H4>
<P>
Abstract: The sovereignty issue in European law, which was recently raised again
before the highest national courts, poses a challenge to legal theory. The
supremacy of EC law should not be regarded as imposing a strict hierarchy within
a monistic legal system. A pluralistic and interactive analysis of the relations
between the legal systems of the Member States and their common system of EC law
suggests instead that the highest court within each system retains
interpretative competence-competence. Although pluralist legal theory therefore
supports the claim that sovereignty has not passed to the organs of the Union,
the same analysis confirms that sovereignty has not remained with the individual
Member States either: a more subtle understanding of the meaning of sovereignty
and its locus is necessary.
</P>
<H4>'Problems of a Concept of European Citizenship',<BR> Ulrich K. Preu&szlig;</H4>
<P>
Abstract: The article explores the possible content of the newly established
institution of `Citizenship of the Union' as stipulated in Articles 8-8d of the
EU Treaty. Within the broad scope of varying historical meanings which the
concept of citizenship has undergone in the last two thousand years its main
relevance must be found in its affiliation with the modern constitutional
nation-state and its basic political feature, namely its anti-primordialism and
its representative character. Although the European Community does not satisfy
the conditions of democratic representation which are essential for the
constitutional nation-state, the idea of citizenship can acquire a new meaning
within the framework of the EU in that it is disconnected both from nationality
and from national identity and opens the space for actions of which the
significance is no longer defined by the territorial boundaries of the
nation-state.

<H4>'Does Europe Need a Constitution?',<BR> Dieter Grimm</H4>
<P>
Abstract: In what has become known as the `Maastricht II' debate the call for a
European constitution plays a great part. Often it is even expected to provide
the solution to Europe's democracy problem. This paper looks at the calls for a
constitution and asks how far they are already met by the Treaties and what
consequences fully meeting them would have for the Union and the Member States.

<H4>'Judicial Exceptions to the Free Provision of Services',<BR> Jos&eacute;
Mari&aacute; Fern&aacute;ndez Mart&iacute;n and S&iacute;ofra O'Leary</H4>
<P>
Abstract: Recent case-law of the Court of Justice on general interest exceptions
to the free provision of services has indicated a flexible approach to general
interest exceptions involving moral or ethical issues. In contrast, where the
general interest exception is relied on in a case which demonstrates
predominantly economic issues, it is subject to strict scrutiny, in particular,
with reference to the principle of proportionality. The article analyses the
Court's case-law and tries to deduce the criteria which now govern the Court's
position. It also highlights difficulties which this two-tier approach may
excite. The position of the Court of Justice reflects the lack of homogeneous
European ethical and moral standards, but it also underlines the predominantly
economic character of European integration to date. It is submitted,
nevertheless, that divorcing the economic criteria for integration from general
ethical considerations will prove an extremely difficult, if not fruitless,
task.

<H4>'Codification of EC Administrative Procedures? Fitting the Foot to the Shoe
or the Shoe to the Foot',<BR> Carol Harlow</H4>
<P>
Abstract: There are two basic models of EC Administrative Process: Direct, where
the procedures are carried out by the Commission and Indirect, where Member
States act as agents for the Community. In the first case, the development of
general principles to structure the procedures has to date been undertaken by
the ECJ. The problem posed by indirect administration, governed by the National
Principles of Administrative law is one of variable standards. For different
reasons, both models raise the question whether EC Administrative procedures
should be codified. This article contrasts two styles of codification found in
the Member States: the first, a short statement of general principles, favoured
by the Council of Europe and resembling the standards set out in the
Jurisprudence of the ECJ; the second, a detailed codification typified by the
German Administrative Procedures Code. The author concludes that the first
method may be more appropriate for the EC.
</P>
<H4>'Codification of Administrative Law: The US and the Union',
<BR> Martin Shapiro</H4>
<P>
Abstract: The US Administrative Procedures Act of 1946 was engendered by
partisan political conflicts. Initially judicial review of administrative
rule-making under the act was extremely deferent. In the course of the 1960s and
1970s the federal courts, basing themselves upon the unchanged language of the
statute, created a new body of administrative law characterised by very great
demands on the agencies and very intrusive judicial review. This transformation
was fuelled by partisan realignments, fear of technocracy and desire for greater
transparency and popular participation in government decision-making. Because
these same forces are now active in relation to the Union, it may be anticipated
that similar tendencies toward a demanding procedural law of rule-making and
high levels of judicial review will be felt as Union administrative law
develops.

<H4>'The Still More Difficult Task: The European Agency for the Evaluation of
Medicines and European Regulation of Pharmaceuticals',
<BR> John Gardner</H4>
<P>
Abstract: The new European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products is
the focus of the EC's new regulatory framework for approval of pharmaceuticals
for human and veterinary use.  This article considers past efforts at European
pharmaceutical regulation, discusses the new `centralised' and `decentralised'
procedures, and offers a functional analysis of the new system.  It addresses
European regulation of biotechnology, including Parliament's 1995 rejection of
the proposed biotechnology directive using its codecision powers.  It also
reviews European case law and suggests that the Court of Justice's decision in
Keck provides a useful way to analyse pharmaceuticals' place in the free
movement of goods.  While the new framework will likely improve approval of
pharmaceuticals and over time lead to greater centralisation of the process,
Member States will still retain some autonomy over the actual use of approved
drugs, particularly through their continued control of conditions of
reimbursement in national health systems.

<H4>'Intergovernmental  Conference 1996: Which Constitution For The Union?',<BR>
Michael Nentwich and Gerda Falkner</H4>
<P>
Abstract: This paper addresses the five major structural issues on the agenda of
the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference of the Member States of the European
Union: the option of replacing the treaty framework by a European constitution;
the issue of fundamental rights in the Union; the future of the three-pillar
structure; the puzzling question of how to allow for variations in European
integration without endangering unity; and, finally, the political 'evergreen'
of the division of competences between the Union and its Member States. The
analysis is based on contributions by EC institutions and prominent groups of
experts and scholars published before the political bargaining started.

<H4>'Taking the Law Seriously: On Political Science and the Role of Law in the
process of European Integration',<BR> Christian Joerges</H4>
<P>
</P>
<P>Abstract: The interdisciplinary discourse on European law seems paradoxical.
While the editors of this Journal plead for a contextual jurisprudence,
political scientists are discovering the importance of law for the integration
process. This article explores the merits and problems of both of these shifts
On the one hand, it points to implicit assumptions of legal arguments that need
to be contrasted with the insights of political sciences into mechanisms of
integration processes and the functioning of intergovernmental bargaining - and
is thus to be read as an appeal for a 'contextual' jurisprudence. On the other
hand, it argues that political science analyses, even when they take the legal
dimension of European integration into account, tend to rely upon an
instrumentalist view of the legal system which fails to acknowledge the Law's
normative logic and discursive power. This theoretically complex argument is
exemplified first by an analysis of the tensions between the legal
supranationalism of the European Court of Justice and the German Constitutional
Court's defence of national constitutionalism, already intensively discussed in
this Journal.
</P>
<P>What the article adds is an extension of the constitutional debate to the
economy. It argues that Europe cannot, and should not, be based upon a
dichotomous structure of (national) political rights and (European) economic
liberties.

<H4>'Democratic Policy in Europe',<BR> Fritz W. Scharpf</H4>
<P>
</P>
<P>Abstract: This article examines the implications of European integration for
democratic self-determination. Distinguishing between the dimensions of
'autonomy' and 'effectiveness', it is argued that autonomous processes of
democratic participation, public discourse and democratic accountability have
not yet been established on the European level. On the other hand, the
effectiveness of democratic self-determination at the national level is
increasingly constrained by processes of economic globalisation and even more so
by the completion of the European internal market. At the same time, however,
conflicts of interest among the Member States of the European Union often stand
in the way of effective European problem-solving in those areas where the
nation-state is losing control. It is argued, therefore, that it would be
desirable to allow greater legal scope to national policy choices by limiting
the reach of ' negative integration' and European competition law in those areas
where the Union itself, for political reasons, is incapable of effective action.
 
</P>
<H4>'Dismantling or Strengthening Labour Law: The Case of the European Court of
Justice',<BR> Spiros Simitis</H4>
<P>
Abstract: The European Court of Justice is increasingly accused of dismantling
labour law. Such unusually sharp criticism is mainly motivated by four
determining, though concealed reasons. First, the fact that many decisions
address conflicts familiar to national law which are however largely repressed
in the national context; second, the crisis of the national labour markets and
the ensuing attempts to fence them off from the consequences of advancing
integration; third, the inconsistent policies of a Union caught between the
prevailing orientation towards a distinctly economic Community and the demands
of a slowly progressing political Union; and fourth, the Union's difficulties to
meet its own claims. As a result, the Court of Justice is more and more
distracted from its judicial role and forced into a regulatory function. Hence,
it is important to recall that a consistent integration process inevitably
requires abandoning national regulations and creating a growing body of common
rules intended to realise the common objectives. Further, the Union must more
than ever attempt to correct its structural deficiencies and lay down
fundamental rights, both in order to give direction to its regulatory
interventions, and to limit them. Finally, the time has come for a clear
specialisation of the European Court of Justice itself, as well as a systematic
review of the conditions governing preliminary rulings, in order to avoid any
further instrumentalisation of the Court for the solution of internal conflicts
of the Member States.

<H4>'Positive Action in Favour of Women and the Many Meanings of Equality - a
Conceptual Analysis',<BR> Anne Peters</H4>
<P>
Abstract: The principle of equality of men and women as understood by Community
institutions covers four distinguishable aspects. The first is equal treatment,
defined in Community texts as the absence of legal gender discrimination. This
concept focuses on individual rights and does not take into account the social
context in which rules function. Second, the Community seeks to realise equal
opportunities, understood as factual equality of chances. Third, Community law
displays a concern for factually equal outcomes. The institutions accept legally
different treatment that seeks to equalise unequal living conditions and
inversely admit that facially neutral rules can have discriminatory effects.
Finally, various documents conceive of gender equality as equal representation
of the sexes in professional and public life. In the Kalanke decision of October
1995, the Court for the first time dealt with quotas in favour of women. It held
that a national provision granting female candidates an automatic preference is
incompatible with the right to equal treatment. The Court failed to acknowledge
the tensions that arise from the coexistence of paradigms. An awareness of the
multiplicity of concepts of equality, exhibited in Community law and rooted in
the common constitutional heritage of the Member States is however a
prerequisite for a more sophisticated discussion of the issue of positive
action.

<H3>Editorial: Francis Snyder</H3>
<H3>Articles:</H3>
<H4>'Francovich and the Problem of the Disobedient State',<BR> Carol Harlow</H4>
<P>
Abstract: This paper is an attempt to evaluate the rapidly expanding line of
jurisprudence which derives from Francovich and Bonifaci v Italian Republic
(Cases 6, 9/90). The paper argues that there is a serious mismatch between the
priorities of the EC and national legal orders and that the impact of the
superior on national legal systems may be both unexpected and detrimental.
Section I argues: that the theoretical underpinnings for state liability in EC
law are in fact weak and raise objections of principle; that 'infection' of
national liability systems by the new principle is both inevitable and
problematic; and that damage may be caused to the EC liability system through
'cross-infection'. Section II argues that in the modern state, balance between
the Rule of Law doctrine and principles of political and democratic supremacy
are both hard to attain and inevitably the subject of controversy. This problem
is heightened within the Community by the existence of competing legislative
systems, lack of clarity over sovereignty and worries over democratic deficit.
The contribution of Francovich to the resolution of these problems is largely
negative.
</P>
<H4>'Motive Unmasked: The European Court of Justice, the Free Movement of Goods
and the Search for Legitimacy',<BR> Todd. J. Friedbacher</H4>
<P>
Abstract: In exempting from scrutiny under Article 30 EC certain measures
constituting 'selling arrangements', the author examines whether the European
Court of Justice in Keck and Mithouard and its progeny sought more than mere
clarification of its jurisprudence on the free movement of goods. To wit, he
claims that the Court was motivated by a sense of waning faith in its
institutional legitimacy, initiating in Keck an attempt to more vigorously
police the Community-Member State jurisdictional divide in favour of Member
State prerogatives, banishing the Community judicial and legislative branches
from the realm of 'selling arrangements'. After critical assessment of this
hypothesis and of the Court's success, a final section queries whether the ECJ
has adopted similar strategies in the Competition law and services realms.
</P>
<H4>'Decision-making after the EU Intergovernmental Conference',
<BR> Torsten Peters</H4>
<P>
</P>
<P>Abstract: One central point of debate at the current EU Intergovernmental
Conference will be the reform of EU decision-making. This article begins by
briefly summarising the current decision-making system in the EU. It then
approaches in a quantitative manner how a lowering of the qualified majority
threshold in the Council of Ministers would increase EU decision-making
capacity. Finally, it proposes new decision-making procedures which might be
particularly well-suited to overcoming EU indecision. 
</P>
<H4>'Ex Pluribus Unum: Fusion of the European Communities into the European
Union',<BR> Armin von Bogdandy and Martin Nettesheim</H4>
<P>
Abstract: This article presents the main legal approaches used in constructing
the relationships between the TEU, TEC, TEAC and TECSC and the institutions set
up by them. It argues that the dominant approaches which separate the European
Union from the European Communities run into serious difficulties when
explaining the normative framework and the actual practice of the EU
institutions. In contrast, the proposed 'unity thesis' asserts that de lege lata
the European Union can be considered one entity from the point of view of the
organisation, its actions and its law. The article develops in detail the legal
premises and some of the consequences of this thesis.

<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff">

<H1>European Law Journal</H1>

<H2>Style sheet and guide for contributions</H2>

<EM>General:</EM> All contributions should be submitted in house
style. The Editors will be happy to discuss proposed contributions
and drafts with contributors.
<P>
Contributions should be typed on A4 paper, double spaced and with
a 2.54 cm (one-inch) margin on both sides of the page. They should
be accompanied by an abstract of 100-150 words in length. The
length of articles should usually not exceed 10,000 words including
abstract and footnotes. Authors should submit two paper copies
of their contribution. They should also submit the contribution
on diskette in IBM compatible format, prefreably in Word or Wordperfect.
Articles should be submitted in English. In exceptional instances,
it may be possible to arrange for translation.
<P>
Footnotes should be numbered sequentially throughout the text
and should appear at the bottom of the page. Authors are asked
to keep footnotes as short as possible and to make cross-references
within the text as sparingly as possible. A list of references
should be given at the end of the article.
<P>
Whenever possible, alterations should be made to the manuscript
and not on the proofs. Every correction to proofs results in resetting
of the text, hence delay and increased cost. Revisions to proofs
should be limited to essential new material which was not available
at the time the contribution was initially submitted.
<P>
<EM>Manuscripts: </EM>English rather than American spelling should
be used, eg recognise, not recognize; labour, not labor.
<P>
All full points and commas should be placed inside quotation marks.
Semi-colons and colons go outside quotation marks. Footnote numbers
should be placed outside quotation marks except when they are
part of the exact quoted.
<P>
Quotations should be indicated by single quotation marks. A quotation
within a quotation should be indicated by double quotation marks.
A quotation which is more than about five lines long should be
indicated as a separate paragraph, with a line space above and
below. All quotations should remain exactly as in the original.
<P>
Latin phrases and other non-English expressions should always
be in italics unless they are so common that they have become
wholly absorbed into everyday language such as etc, bona fide.
For example: <I>amicus curiae</I>.
<P>
A logical system of headings and subheadings, of descending levels
of importance, should be used throughout. If headings and subheadings
are numbered, the numbering should be consistent. The preferred
style is as follows: 
<H1>I Introduction <BR>
II Style Sheet </H1>

<H2>A Quotations <BR>
B Headings </H2>

<H1>III Citation of Published Works </H1>

<H2>A Books <BR>
B Edited Books <BR>
C Articles </H2>

<H1>IV Conclusion </H1>

Authors are asked to avoid the use of further subheadings if at
all possible. Headings and subheadings are designed to guide the
reader through the paper, so all headings and subheadings which
do not add substantially to clarity should be omitted. Books should
be cited as follows:<BR>

should be in single quotation marks and not italicised. The titles
of books and journals should be underlined, not italicised. Common
abbreviations of journals should be used whenever possible. If
the full name of a journal is used, it should be in italics. For

<H1>Antonio Cassese,</H1>

following his appointment as Chairman of the International War
Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, The Hague, he left
his full-time position in the department. He continues, however,
as Director of the Academy of European Law. Born in 1937, he studied
law at the Universities of Pisa and Frankfurt and the Institut
universitaire des hautes etudes internationales, Geneva. He was
professor at the University of Pisa (1964-74) and then at Florence,
where he directed the School of International Affairs and was
Professor in International Law at the Faculty of Political Sciences
'Cesare Alfieri'. He has been a member of the Italian delegation
to the United Nations General Assembly and to diplomatic conferences
on human rights and the international law of armed conflict. In
1987-88 he chaired the Steering Committee for Human Rights of
the Council of Europe and at present is President of the European
Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading
Treatment. His publications are on the law of armed conflict,
on conditions restricting the use of force, on human rights, on
parliamentary control of foreign policy and on the responsibility
of States for international crimes. His research pursues two themes:
the first is the role of the principle of self-determination of
peoples in the world community; the second concerns international
human rights protection, particularly in the Council of Europe
context.

<H1>Russia as Europe's other</H1>

<H3>Iver B. Neumann</H3>

<H4>European University Institute, Florence, and Norwegian Institute
of International Affairs</H4>

<H5>Abstract</H5>

<P>
A human collective forge identities for itself partly by the way
they represent other human collectives - their 'others'. Russia
stands out as an interesting case where the much understudied
question of European identity formation is concerned. No matter
which social practices a period has foregrounded, be they religious,
bodily, intellectual, social, military, political, economic or
otherwise, Russia has consistently been seen as an irregularity.
Basing itself on 500 years of writings about Muscovy, Russia and
the Soviet Union  in English, German, French and Danish, the paper
demonstrates how Russia has quite consistently been represented
as just having been tamed, civil, civilised, just having begun
to participate in European politics, just having become part of
Europe. Since the enlightenment it has, furthermore, been seen
as a pupil and a learner, be that a successful one (the authorised
version of the enlightenment), a misguided one (the alternative
version of the enlightenment), a fuks who should learn but refuses
to do so (the authorised version of the nineteenth century), a
truant (the twentieth century), a gifted but somewhat pigheaded
one (the present). It is therefore deeply appropriate that, for
the last five years, the main metaphor used in European discussions
of Russian politics and economics has been that of <STRONG>transition</STRONG>.
The ambiguity surrounding Russia's Europeanness should thus not
be discussed as a spatial issue, as it regularly is, but along
its temporal dimension, as the country which is perpetually seen
as being in some stage of transition to Europeanisation. It is
suggested that ongoing political debates about 'Russia' are invariably
tainted by this history, and a call is made for more reflection
on how those debates themselves work to perpetuate certain representations
of Russia to the detriment of others. Such reflection may have
the welcome effect of working against possible attempts to 'build'
a European identity by drawing on the experiences and rhetoric
of ethnicised nation building.

<h2>Survey Results</H2>
<P>
With the Amazing Environmental Organization WebDirectory! Survey, we tried to be a little different
than most surveys conducted on the Net. Rather than displaying results in the form of statistics
and charts in response to yes/no questions, we decided to ask more thought provoking
questions about environmental topics that concern you, and display every response in its
entirety, unedited, for the world to read. Enjoy!
<P>
After this page has completed loading, click on any of the questions below to automatically scroll this page to the results:<P>

<B>If you could do one thing to improve the environment, what would that be?</B>

resposibility for their individual actions and those of 
their family and dependents...at home, on the job, and in the 
community...the pollution problem would not exist as we know it.
<LI>Water preservation.  I wish that we had 2 sources for water.
1 Source for clean drinking / cooking water and 
another for water that does not require the stringient 
cleanliness.  If we had that secondary source. we could 
satisfy the world's thirst for clean water, lengthen life
expectancies, and create a better world for our children.

To change the people's value towards the obligations of everyone (present and our future generations) deserve to live a good life, and it is our responsibility to preserve and protect what we are having in this beautiful planet.
<LI>Create a market for native species (especially rare and threatened) to ensure that these species would continue to survive and be promoted to the general public. This would also give the general public an idea of these species true value (both economic and environmental).
<LI>Write or rewrite laws to be reasonable, scientific, and equitable.
<LI>Stop littering
<LI>Stop the unbridled growth of human population
<LI>RECYCLE
<LI>Help save the rain forests
<LI>Recycle
<LI>Put birth control in the beer :)  Actually, limit further habitat loss through responsible urban development and family planning/education.
<LI>I would find a way to perserve the enviroment by finding getting rid of our overuse of paper and by our overpopulation problem
<LI>Devise a non pollutant fuel
<LI>Implement a serious alternative fuels policy.
<LI>Education, hints to improve the selective information transfer flow.
<LI>Legalize hemp!
<LI>Try to have a less negative effect on the resources I use
<LI>Enforce stricter standards on the emission of toxic wastes into our atmosphere
<LI>Get rid of capitalism
<LI>Recycle more containers than are presently recycled
or think up ways to recycle or reuse that which is 
presently sent to the dumps
<LI>Find a way to clean up the rivers, lakes and oceans and keep them clean.
<LI>Give control of the land to communities, not corporations.
<LI>Expose the log export hypocrisy, change over the paper industry to hemp-based
paper production for starters.
<LI>Lower population growth through education.
<LI>Get my whole country to start recycling
<LI>I would make recycling legally compulsory and have much 
harsher penalties for 'enviro-crimes'.
<LI>Remove the hype, the PC, and the political agendas from scientific debate, and operate solely on fact, properly and scientifically demonstrated.
<LI>Eliminate cars
<LI>Minimize erosion to a natural state
<LI>Limit number of large primates
<LI>Stop killing goats

e.g. not to throw scrap everywhere 
<LI>Transfer all Defense dollars to Education.
<LI>Reduce world population
<LI>To help control what people put in the oceans and to find a way to make the oceans cleaner.
<LI>Revolutionize the way British Columbian's manage their resources.
This would be accomplished by "Human Management" instead of "Resource Management".  
People in British Columbia would manage their behaviour towards resources
instead of managing the resources to support their behaviour.
<LI>Research new solutions
<LI>Ban cars
<LI>Create a world organization that would survey all the waste
the companies in the world throw away.	 
<LI>Educate the masses
<LI>Not reproduce
<LI>Make solar energy available at affordable cost in the regions
where it is needed. (Many parts of the 'developing' world).
<LI>Sorry I do not honestly know.
<LI>I'd advocate that conservation and environmental issues classes be taught in elementary school and high school, even in farming and industrial areas (where they'd be less popular), and i'd 
advocate more use of public transportation systems-they're cheaper, quicker, and healthier, but still in the metropolitan areas of the U.S. people are driving to work everyday with single passengers,
etc.
<LI>Develop viable underground housing to preserve the natural ecosystem.
<LI>Strengthen pollution prevention policy, couple pp and economic development policy.  
<LI>Technology transfert and business contace
<LI>Recycle more and use less waste.
<LI>Better educational tools for large scale programs

I am the editor of Farmers News, the newspaper of the Farmers Union of Iceland. I simply say your address and just wanted to say "hello". The paper is published 2 times each month, usually 16 pages. Icelandic farmers are rather few, around 5000, but our country is still clean and we are slowly turning towards organic farming. Yours, Askell Thorisson
<BR>- <i>Askell Thorisson, Reykjavik, Iceland</i><P>

THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!! What a wonderful directory to have available to millions.
<BR>- <i>Monique Brown, San Francisco, CA, USA</i><P>

I would also like to thank you and let you know that many students found your page very useful this semester. We have added it to the Wayne College Learning Resource Center Lab's regular bookmarks.
<BR>- <i>Nick D'Amato, Akron, OH, USA</i><P>

Well done.  Your page is intelligently and attractively designed, and it provides a much-needed service.  I have only one suggestion:  how about a section on activism and volunteer opportunities?
<BR>- <i>Nicholas Dunham, Fair Oaks, CA, USA</i><P>

Your webdirectory is fantastic.  All of the major national environmental organizaions are listed here. Your employment section is very helpful.
<BR>- <i>Robert Courtnage, Fredericksburg, VA, USA</i><P>



It is unfortunate to see pseudo scientific, ie., non-scientific information passing for facts. Secondly, it is unfortunate that most of the sites have their own political agenda.  There are so many informative scientific books and articles on Environmentalism (everyone qualifies as an Environmentalist - not just the eco cultists). I was hoping to see facts, statistics, and objective scientific information about different areas.  Unfortunately, this is not the case. 
<BR>- <i>Anonymous, Ontario, Canada</i><BR>
<BR>
Excellent directory.  Most comprehensive and well designed.  Certainly, a tremendous benefit to the environmental industry.
<BR>- <i>Wayne Adams, West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA</i><BR>
<BR>
You guys are pretty weird.  Just wanted to let you know that this is the 100th anniversary of the automobile.  Thought you'd like to know that.  I know you'd rather live in an Amish Paradise with ALGORE and eat veggie-sawdust- burgers! I'll check back but I doubt I'll see this on your listing of letters PRAISING you guys.  Don't what to be biased do you?
<BR>- <i>Jeremy, Huntsville, TX, USA</i><BR>
<BR>
I think your Directory is extremely useful. It fulfils a very significant need.
<BR>- <i>Gerald F. Graham, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada</i><BR>
<BR>
Love your home page! Found you while researching search engines/web directories for our site (www.sanet.com). Didn't have much time to check content, but I like the look. I got a big kick out of some of the comments in the HTML code. This mail form is kinda neat, but IMHO a mailto: tag is better.
<BR>- <i>Hagen Bollen, El Dorado, AR, USA</i><BR>
<BR>
The WebDirectory staff, you are doing a wonderful job.  Your site is easy to read and to find ones way around.  Keep up the good work.  L.Y. Racine   Phoenix, AZ
<BR>- <i>Lanette Y. Racine, Phoenix, AZ, USA</i><BR>
<BR>
A wonderful page!!! It's to bad the seedy elements of the Net get so much publicity and the wonderful stuff like your page get so little! Keep up the good work!
<BR>- <i>Jim Molloy, Lyons, CO, USA</i><BR>
<BR>
This is such a great web site!!!  I just discovered it via Netscape's new Navigator format.  I intend to visit here often.  Keep up the GREAT work!<BR>
- <i>Mark Golembiewski, Daly City, CA, USA</i><BR>
<BR>
How about an energy file with some content? This is the same deadend as the  Dept. of Energy. Perhaps it is to scary to put in real terms. Who would want to admit to using 10kw. of energy per hour forever like we americans do?<BR>
- <i>Ron Branch, San Francisco, CA, USA</i><BR>
<BR>
I'm absolutely amazed at the site!!! Today was the first time here and it is unbelievable.<BR>
<i>- Andy</i><BR>
<BR>
Fantastic idea - now individuals and companies with environmental problems can search one directory dedicated to environmental problems and solutions.<BR>
- <i>Lou, Montclair, Virginia USA</i><BR>
<BR>
Thanks for adding us! This is sure to draw attention to our Web page.<BR>
<i>- John</i><BR>
<BR>
Thanks for the help.  Without this directory, it would have taken us ages to get in touch with the groups we need.<BR>
- <i>Boston University (CASE)</i><BR>
<BR>
Greetings for your information. The energy is the basis of human civilization but the environment the future of human life. Bye from Spain.<BR>
- <i>Juan</i><BR>
<BR>
 Thanks for the excellent homepage.  I'm an ex-environmental consultant working in Taiwan.  Taiwan is an environmental nightmare!<BR>
- <i>Dave</i><BR>
<BR>
Great resource.  How about a listing of chat groups?<BR>
- <i>Kyle</i><BR>
<BR>
Thanks a lot!  We're just getting around on the Web and a directory like yours is very helpful!<BR>
- <i>Bill</i><BR>
<BR>
It's my first time on the Internet and I think that the network is incredible, the possibility of the information is infinite, but when the information it's very near to the infinity, it's similar to zero. Thanks for this opportunity, sorry for my english, bye...<BR>
- <i>Eduardo, Santiago, Chile</i><BR>
<BR>
Your site is impressive.  I just wanted to tell you that even though I am on a fast modem, your background took a long time to load.  I think I noticed that it was 37K.  If you are going to use a consistent color, you could use a much smaller gif and it would load almost instantly.  Just thought i'd say.<BR>
- <i>Joey, Austin, TX, USA</i><BR>
<BR>
Beautiful pages.  Could drop-down lists for categories be added to the "Add you organization" page?  Thank you for maintaining this site and for all your hard work!<BR>
- <i>Dan, St. Cloud, MN USA</i><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the TOP environmental sites I have seen.<BR>
- <i>Michael, Canoga Park, CA, USA</i><BR>
<BR>
ThankYou for maintaining this useful resource!!!<BR>
- <i>Joan, Victoria, BC, Canada</i><BR>
<BR>
I'm a Newbie and this information is of great help to me - Thanks guys<BR>
- <i>David, Adelaide, Australia</i><BR>
<BR>
I logged on to do a little exploration on a Wednesday evening, discovered this directory and am about to log off a couple of hours later.  This is great--one place that brings eco related information together to create a sustainable plot along the infobyways.<BR>

As an environmentalest and a victom of toxic injury I think there should be an allience between human health organizations and envrionmental organizations and would like to see more about Human Ecology, emerging disabilities,Multiple Chemical Sensitivities, Environmental injury and human disease. Since the same poisions that kill wildlife are harming humans we sould work together agains pollution.  
<BR>- <i>Ed Hogan, Manassas, VA, USA </i><P>

Thank you all. Without advertising like yours many small recycling compamies would not exist.
<BR>- <i>Forrest Charnockm, Houston, TX, USA</i><P>

Your service is indispensible in the creation of a greener future. I eagerly await your next offering. Dave Beckwith, Founder/President Charlotte Internet Society
<BR>- <i>Dave Beckwith, Charlotte, NC, USA</i><P>

I just wanted to say finding your site was to me like when you find (lets say) a $20 bill in your pair-of-pants pocket that you just got off the dryer (Bingo!).  I learned about it (your site) just a few minutes ago when searching for something else.  I haven't got the time to navigate thru your web directory (as I said earlier, ...just discovered it) but I already like it. I especially like how well in categories you organized it.
See... I am particularly interested on it because I am a graduate student in environmental engineering. Your directory certainly will be very helpful on my research for the master's project this Fall semester.  So, thanks, congratulations and "hasta la vista".
<BR>- <i>Edwin Garcia-Cardona, Virginia Beach, VA, USA</i><P>

I visit the Amazing Environmental Directory at least one every month. Now that I'm writing two books on environmental travel in Mexico and Honduras I find myself searching for all kinds of information. Your website is well organized and it's even fun to browse! Keep up the good work. Saludos, Ron
<BR>- <i>Ron Mader, Mexico</i><P>

This is one terrific site! I've had the Net at home for just 1 week, and have been searching out stuff I care about. Your site is at the top of my list!
<BR>- <i>Marcia Goodman, Bridgeport, CT, USA</i><P>


Just visited your pages for the first time.  Extremely high quality work.  This is not just fluff but a major contribution.  This must be a labor of love.  Thanks for putting together some very useful but also very aesthetically pleasing pages.  Great job!!!<BR>
- <i>Bob, FL, USA</i><BR>

Put in more scientific information so people have something to go on besides just seeing advertisements about some environmentally-intact organization.  Sometimes research is necessary when conducting energy-efficient, environmentally-safe tests, either at home or at the work place.  The new experiment, Energy Net, which is being used at schools across the globe, uses facts to back up the desired environmental product that is wanted to become installed in the schools.  School boards do not just decide to change a product just because a kid tells them to   they are more interested in the economics of it all.  Therefore, statistics, facts, and additional information are necessary for the Energy Net to begin to work.
<BR>- <i>Anonymous</i><BR>
<BR>
Very well done!  I like the way you have harnessed your information in a clean, hierarchical manner.  High informational content and intelligent (not overwhelming) advertising.  I like the green background too!
<BR>- <i>Steven Valin, Piscataway, NJ, USA</i><BR>
<BR>
In news papers there should be more animal facts like dogs  the sun and toronto star dont put any thing about animals  but they should  because every body is angry because of that reason  just like me so just do that  now  
<BR>- <i>Jennifer, Toronto, Ontario, Canada</i><BR>
<BR>
Seems to be an excellent resource, I found it by chance, but will now use it as the first option when looking for Environmental issues. I will certainly be adding a link on my page in the very near future. Keep up the good Work!
<BR>- <i>Michael, Bedford, Bedfordshire, UK</i><BR>
<BR>
I just wanted to say how much I appreciate the time and effort that you have put into creating this WebDirectory. It's a great way to raise consciousness about the plight of our many animal friends. Keep up the good work!!! My family and I are big nature buffs so this site is of great use to us. Keep up the good work!!!
<BR>- <i>Jennifer Fumero, Lajas, Puerto Rico</i><BR>

Frames are great but there are many draw backs to them in their current implementation. I would reconsider using them on your home page because they do not seem absolutley necessary. By the way, your site is wonderful and has been a great help to us in finding what we are looking for in the field.
<BR>- <i>Maureen Koplow, New York, NY USA</i><BR>
<BR>
Great job! I clicked on the Net Directory button in Netscape and found you in 5 seconds. Finally the environment community has one place to start!<BR>
- <i>DeeDee, Goleta, CA USA</i><BR>
<BR>
I am shocked at the ineffectiveness of the environmental organizations.  The Clinton Administration has been an unmitigated disaster for environmental protection.  While Ms. Browner et. al. have effectively dismantled the EPA, you sat by, I assume because you were afraid to go after your "allies." Now the Gingrichites have taken  further.  Way to go.  Even if the budget battle is "won", we will now be at ground zero.  EPA is now a shadow of itself, thanks to the Dems and Reps, and it will take at least a generation to repair it. Yes, EPA is now the ICC. Good job.<BR>
- <i>Bob Linett, Burke, VA USA</i><BR>
<BR>
Thank you so much for creating this amazing site! The web is an enormous means of action for the Environmental communtiy, and how great to have it so acessible by Netscape.  Hopefully many will find and use this resource!  Thank you!<BR>
- <i>Benjamin</i><BR>
<BR>
This is an excellent site! I am surprised that I just found it. I will definitely add a link to it from my site (within a few days) and am happy to send people here. I hope you will find us worthy of inclusion.<BR>
- <i>Janice</i><BR>

I only hope and pray the polar bears can stay safe and that not too much of man's life garbage enters his wonderful home.<BR>

Excellent Site WOW!<BR>

<BR>
Thank you for the help in promoting our site. We will do the same for you.<BR>

Interesting site, well done!<BR>

<h2>Information</h2>

<i>Amazing Environmental Organization WebDirectory!</i> is the result of a group of hard working people dedicated to helping
others keep in touch and informed on the World Wide Web.  With thousands of sites, 
it is the largest exclusively environmental organization directory on the Web
and includes sites from over 100 countries.  Our goal is simple - to make it easy for people from around the world to find your web page.
We currently have 23 terrific <A HREF="/info/staff.shtml">staff members</A> - all dedicated to provide a free service to the environmental community.
I hope you find the WebDirectory useful, simple and fun.

<B>The WebDirectory Advertiser Program</B><BR>
Becoming a WebDirectory <A HREF="/info/advertiser_info.shtml">Advertiser</A> allows your organization to use
the full potential of the largest exlusively environmental organization directory
on the web to quickly bring tremendous exposure to your cause.<P> 

<B>Are you working on a project and need to find more information?</B><BR>
Are you a student working on a project and can't locate something?<BR>
Are you interested in a particular subject and don't know where to look?<BR>
Would you like to know a few great places to search for something?<BR>
The answer to all these questions is "See our <A HREF="/info/other_places_to_search.shtml" >Other Places To Search</A> page!"<P>

<B>Want to add your web page to this directory?</B><BR>
Simply click <A HREF="/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/jdickson/addurl" >Add Your Web Page</A> at any menu and this will present you with a form to fill out.
The most important part of the form is the box for your URL which begins with "http://"
You must put your home page's web address in that box. If you do not have a web address beginning with
"http://", please come back again at a later date and fill out the form when you do.
Mailing addresses and E-mail addresses are no longer added to the WebDirectory.<P>

<B>So what the heck is the <IMG SRC="/images/folderx.gif"> you see on some of the subdirectories?</B><BR>
It means that it is actually a shortcut to a subdirectory somewhere else in the WebDirectory.
This is useful organization tool when several categories share a common
sub-topic or when we want to help you find an important category that is buried deep in the directory tree. For example the <A HREF="/Science/Agriculture/Forestry/"><IMG ALIGN=absbottom BORDER=0 SRC="/images/folderx.gif" ALT="shortcut to"><B> Forestry</B></A>
category in the main menu is really a shortcut to the <B>Science:Agriculture:Forestry</B> category.<P>

<h2>Bulletin Board - Frequently Asked Questions and Answers</h2>
Here is a brief explanation of some of the questions you may have 
about the Bulletin Board.<hr>
<ul>
<li><a href="#links">Can I use html tags anywhere in my submissionss?</a>
<li><a href="#colons">Why are there colons in the message section when I 
try submit a followup?</a>
<li><a href="#reload">Why didn't my submission show up?</a>
</ul><HR><p>
<a name="links"><B>Can I put html tags anywhere in my submissions?</B></a><p>
No.  You can not use HTML tags in any field except body of the message.  
The maintainer of the script has the option of allowing or 
disallowing any HTML in the Message part of your submission.  If 
they disallow it, the script will just throw out everything in 
&lt;&gt;'s.  If they allow it, your html markup will appear in 
the submission.  It can't hurt to try.<p> 

<a name="colons"><B>Why are there colons in the message when I try to submit a 
followup?</B></a><p>
Colons appear in the message dialog box when you try to followup up on a 
message to indicate that those lines are quoting the previous document. 
<p>

<a name="reload"><B>Why didn't my submission show up?</B></a><p>
Your submission most likely did not show up, because your browser did not reload the 
page, it simply pulled it out of cache.  Please reload your browser and it 
should then appear.

GARDEN STATE ENVIRONET<br> <br>   The Garden State EnviroNet (GSENET) now offers a full range of FREE<br>online services to the New Jersey environmental community. Started in<br>late 1992 with a Bulletin Board System, it now features the following<br>components:<p>* Bulletin Board: Using your general purpose communications program to<br>dial in, this system provides the main library of files (over 1,000),<br>News & Press releases, plus the file library of the New Jersey Chapter<br>of the Sierra Club. New on the system is an optional Windows front end<br>available for download. Set your communications program to dial:<br>201-627-9213, 8N1, ANSI, 14,000.<p>* ListServer: This very popular feature allows you to receive an email<br>subscription to the Garden State EnviroNews. A daily digest of news<br>and events of special interest to New Jerseyites, this is the easiest<br>way to "stay in touch" with a diverse selection of topics. To start<br>your subscription, just send this message: subscribe gsenet-L to:<br>majordomo@igc.org<p>*Web Site: Started in the Fall of 1996, low on graphics - high on<br>content!

A lot of letters written by italian children of Primary School Maceo of Terme Vigliatore (Messina) addressed to spanish children have been sent from LIDA, Italian League for Animal Rights, to the education and culture Secretary of Spanish Government, to the European Committee for human resources, the education, the training and the youth, to the President of culture Committee, the youth, the European Parliament education and to the spanish newspapers EL PAIS, LA VANGUARDIA, DIARIO 16.<br>Italian boys knowing that tauromachy schools are attended by children of tender age - with the illusion of a very successful future career - have expressed to their spanish contemporaries their upsetting and their disappointment about cruelty teaching and training.<br>The italian children do not know what cruelties spanish children are led to when they practise on little calfs fixing any means and in any way even the torture and the death of those unlucky animals.<br>Neither know what spectacles for minors are prepared in Spain to educate the young spanish to the blood taste and to the indifference for the sorrow and the death.<br>Neither know that DOMINGUIN began practising in the arena when he was 12 years old, nor that EL JULI (Julian Lopez), 14 years old (he might be only 11 years old) has already made two hundred bullfights killing fifty bulls.<br>The LIDA has accompanied children letters with a note denouncing to the European Comittee, to the European Parliament and to the press the violation of art. 29 and the art. 32 of Children Rights Declaration by who trains minors to violence and cruelty.<p>                                          Gili & Gipi<p> http://www.mclink.it/assoc/lida/taurom.htm<p><br> ***************************************<br>  Right to life for all living beings<br>  Right to freedom for every individual<p>                LIDAmatic<br>      http://www.mclink.it/assoc/lida<br>              lida@mclink.it<br> ***************************************

Posted by <a href="mailto:ejmin@nuri.net">Min eun ju</a> on January 07, 1997 at 09:07:02:<p>
" We have fought for 10 days occyping the Pusan City Hall in Korea."  <p>Korean people havelived together with Nokdong River for several<br>thousands years.<br>The river has done as a role of drinking water for 0.1 million peole<br>such as Kyungnam province people,Pusan citizen. We have thought river is<br>so precious for people to live in. It has been our basement of our life.<p>The Nakdong river provide good rest for several kinds of migratory birds<br>and there are good balanced ecosystem. So we have said that "The River<br>is our life".<p>After construction of estuary of Nakdong river, there have been so many<br>accidents such as phenol accident in 1991, detection of poisonous<br>pesticides and heavy metal able to cause cancer in 1993,stink accident<br>in 1994 in Nakdong River so Pusan,Kyungnam Province people's interesting<br>come to be encreased day by day.<p>But that river is threatened to crisis like light standing in front of<br>wind. It is very that plan to construct the industrial complex at Wichon<br>area in middle of Nakdong river, with very huge size. Eventhough 0.1<br>million people drinking Nakdong river in Kyungnam province get enraged,<br>Kim president and administration are driving that plan.<br>Because they think only president ellection, they are considering Daegu<br>and Kyungbuk Province citizen's voting.It means that they are thinking<br>environmental problem politically.<p>We couldn't stand any more. We organized one group called "Pusan citizen<br>countermeasuring commmittee to prohibit the Wichon Industrial Complex"<br>constituted with women,old,labor,environment,traffic,culture,citizen<br>groups and so on 160 groups in Pusan,Kyungnam province since last year.<br>We organized the symposium,conference by citizen to save river and to<br>make the policy of the improvement of river's quality,visiting the "Blue<br>House(president's official residence)","The ministry of construction and<br>traffic" and "The ministry of environment" several times,doing signature<br>movement and campaign and research to know the condition of river's<br>situation and so on.<p>What we are insisting is as follow<p>1.We are objecting the construction plan until when the situation of<br>Nakdong river is improved to 2nd degree(BOD 3ppm)<p>2.The government should establish "the special law" to recover the<br>quality of Nakdong river.<p>3.The government should proclaim the area of extract the river as a<br>drinking water "special area should be protected"<p>4.The factory exploiting the polluters polluting the river should be<br>moved to another area.<p>We need your help.<p>1.Would you write protestant letters your opinion to save Nakdong river<br>to President, Kim Young Sam.<br>Web site: http://cyberpusan.co.kr/wichon<br>(Contact number:E-MAIL ADDRESS:EJMIN@NURI.NET<br>                               pkfem@chollian.net<br>                Fax: 001-82-51-469-7959<br>                Address: (600-013) joong-gu joongang-dong 3-ga 14-1<br>                         hansung B/D 3F<br>                         PUSAN FEDERATION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT<br>                         (You can use the signature paper.)<br>2.Would you sign below signature paper to object the Wichon Industrial<br>Complex<p><p>       Signature Paper<p>We love Nakdong river and are making a effort to protect all of the<br>rivers on the world. River is a resource of people,animal,plant and any<br>kinds of<br>life on the world to live in. We send our solidarity mind to save<br>important river, Nakdong river to Korean people. Korean government<br>should give up "Wichon Industrial Complex" plan and try to make a effort<br>to save "the  Nakdong River". We will work together with K.F.E.M until<br>when the quality  of Nakdong river is improved, at least 2nd<br>degree(3ppm) and until when that plan,destroying the earth,is withdrawn.<p>name of group:<p>signature:<p>

Most of the medicaments are packaged in to PVC films. Blister packaging is a heat forming process, and PVC could be dangerous for Medicaments, when it becames hot???<p>What about PET. The most enviromental frendly plastic, most recyclable plastic. Could PET used for medicamant packaging on the medicine companies?

Lead acid batteries are usually made with <br>sulfuric acid; hence, the fumes can be quite<br>damaging if inhaled.  Any auto parts store or<br>other retailer of lead-acid batteries should<br>carry an MSDS (material safety data sheet) <br>describing the dangers and treatments of the<br>material being sold--they are required to make <br>these available to their customers.  Also, I <br>think the EPA has a website where you could<br>get information.

If anyone has first hand experience in having an insurance claim denied for<br>RAD contamination of personal property or a RAD bodily injury claim, kindly<br>contact me.  I am doing an undated paper on the insurance industry's Radioactive <br>Matter Exclusion Endorsement, the first of which I gave at the Health Physics<br>Annual Meeting last year.  I also have information on financial impact of the RMEE<br>on reversionary mineral rights as well as base closures.  The EPA has requested<br>a formal submittal of comments re: the base closure problem given the insurane<br>industry's "No Threshold - No Liability" stand. <br>

Posted by <a href="mailto:rickrise@waonline.com">Richard Risemberg</a> on January 04, 1997 at 07:49:34:<p>
Ballona Wetlands is the last wetlands left in the Los Angeles area; Playa<br>Vista is a proposed mixed-use hyper-development initiated in part by<br>Steven Spielberg.  It would afffect not only the wetlands but the community<br>already present in the area and already stressed with traffic congestion <br>and pollution.  The following commentary represents my view on the issue.<br>Feel free to copy or re-post this where it may do some good--just don't<br>forget my by-line.  If you are in the area, visit Ballona Wetlands and<br>see for yourself what will be lost if the project goes forward.<p><p>Playa Vista--the Right Project in the Wrong Place?<p><br>Now that the Playa Vista project seems to be stalled--whether <br>because of infighting at Maguire Thomas Partners as some <br>say,  or because of lawsuits filed by a consortium of <br>environmental groups--it is a good time to consider whether <br>the project should be allowed to proceed as planned.  I believe <br>that there are at least two good reasons it should not.  The <br>first, of course, is that, despite the "restoration" to be thrown <br>like a dog biscuit to environmental groups, Playa Vista will <br>devastate what little remains of the Ballona wetlands.  The <br>second is that it is simply in the wrong place.<br>	The preservationist arguments have been flung about <br>vigorously in the last few years, but their salient points bear <br>repeating: wetlands throughout California have been <br>decimated in this century, till now only ten percent of them <br>remain undeveloped.  Ballona itself originally covered almost <br>2,000 acres and supported plant, animal, and fish <br>communities that can exist nowhere else, as well as providing <br>resting places for migratory birds.  Playa Vista's "expansion" <br>of the wetlands would add 69 acres to the 180 that currently <br>remain--according to Playa Vista's own prospectus--resulting <br>in an imitation marsh that would still be too small to support <br>viable populations of the plant and animal life that define a <br>wetland.  A Loyola-Marymount study stresses both the <br>importance of tidal flow to the vitality of the wetlands and the <br>damage that polluted runoff (from the new streets to be built <br>for Playa Vista) would cause it.  If Maguire Thomas--or <br>anyone else--were serious about preserving the Ballona <br>Wetlands, they would offer not only not to build upon it, but <br>also to dismantle some of the development that currently <br>exists around the wetlands, so that the tides could flow again, <br>the soil become saturated with life-giving water, and the mute <br>communities of the tidelands have room to grow and live, and <br>be more than just a diorama to be glanced at from an office <br>window.<br>	But there is another argument against placing Playa <br>Vista by the Ballona wetlands, and it is one that has nothing <br>to do with the wetlands themselves: the fact is that the <br>benefits of a large mixed-use development would not be <br>realized well in the proposed location, and that they would be <br>in another.  For the Playa Vista area does not need Playa <br>Vista: it does not need twenty thousand more automobile trips <br>a day, it does not need new housing, new offices, new studios, <br>new profit for distant pockets at the expense of the human <br>and natural communities already present. There is housing <br>already there, much of it less expensive than Playa Vista's <br>would be; and there are already plenty of employment centers <br>in the area, from LAX south of it, to Marina del Rey north, to <br>Loyola-Marymount University on the bluffs, to the studios in <br>Culver City and the thousands of shops and offices all around.  <br>Each of these already generates traffic, not only of residents <br>and employees, but also of travelers to and from the airport, <br>students, tourists, boaters, and shoppers.  With how much <br>more asphalt and concrete shall we smother the snippets of <br>free soil that remain in order to support Playa Vista?  How <br>much more smog and congestion should we have to endure in <br>the name of development?  Maguire Thomas itself says of <br>Ballona: "It is unique to find such a large, undeveloped urban <br>site with coastline, wetlands and natural bluffs."  They're <br>right--so why destroy it?  Build Playa Vista--just don't build it <br>there.<br>	This is what I propose: build Playa Vista in the <br>ghetto!  Yes, in South-Central, where people are begging for <br>work and good housing, where residents with jobs must <br>endure long commutes to distant parts of town, where an <br>already-developed infrastructure of old factories is waiting to <br>be remade and put to good use.  Where community groups <br>would aid, not oppose, the project, and where the city is often <br>willing to provide tax breaks to businesses.  Playa Vista in <br>South-Central would reduce welfare and police expenses, <br>increase the city's tax revenues, benefit local merchants, and <br>revitalize one of the largest communities in LA--and still <br>make money for Maguire Thomas.  Do the right thing with <br>Playa Vista--build it in the better place.<p>

Posted by <a href="mailto:sjmdesigns@usinternet.com">Susan J. Mielke</a> on January 01, 1997 at 15:23:09:<p>
Hi--My name is Susan Mielke. I am 39 years old, the Mother of 1 Son, and a Naturalist Interior Decorator 'Specializing in Healthier Homes'. I live and work in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota USA. The main products I sell are A.) Non-Toxic Organic Cotton Mattresses @ 15% discount. We drop ship these wonderful beds,worldwide, from California.  B.) Earthguard Carpeting. Made of 80% PET/20% Nylon--this carpeting has little to no toxic smell when installed. It's been manufactured for almost 12 years now and is in many more homes than you may know. It is not only a non-toxic carpet, but the only one made to date with an real upscale look. And, the cleanability is outstanding--I know--I have 7 cats! I've seen other PET carpets, but none compare to Earthguard Carpeting. Area Rugs are also available. I feel very strongly about my work and the responsibility attached to what I do for a living. I, myself have some chemical sensitivites, therfore, I work out of a Studio in Minneapolis. If you'd care to learn more, I'd be happy to send you some in-depth information on the products discussed above. My goals in the near and distant future are, I would like to see our interior environments a great deal healthier, as I'm very sure many of our health problems relate back to those environments. My way of going about this is to offer clients/customers not only healthy products, but to extend to them discounts making them more attractive--thus creating better health for my customers. My hope is not to become financially wealthy, but rather, my hope is to make a difference before I die. I hope to help in every way possible. You may respond in the following ways; Email Address; sjmdesigns@usinternet.com or Call Me @; 1-612-521-8635 M-Sat. CST USA. I hope to hear from you soon. Heres wishing you health and happiness!

I am researching waste reduction programs on behalf of the Northern Environmental Action Team in Fort St John, BC. and would like your help. If your have worked with, organized or even just know about a waste reduction program that your local government or environmental group has tried, please drop me a line. Any suggestions of people or groups to contact would be very appreciated. I am especially interested in unique ideas to use in schools or in the community to promote public awarness about waste reduction.<br> 		Thank you for your help.<br>				S.Gibson

Hey y'all...<p>I just wanted to let everybody know about an awesome organization called Honor the Earth. Its a campaign organized by the Indigenous <br>Environmental Network, the Indigenous Womens Network, the Seventh Generation Fund, and everyone's favorite musical activists, the<br>Indigo Girls. Honor the Earth creates awareness and support for Indigenous environmental issues and leverages needed financial and<br>political resources for the survival of sustainable Indigenous communities. The campaign utilizes music, the arts, media, and Indigenous <br>wisdom to ask people to recognize our joint dependency on the Earth, and create a voice for those who are not heard.  <br>The latest HTE project was the August release of a double CD set called Honor. The album was put out on Daemon Records (an independent<br>label owned and operated by Indigo Girl Amy Ray), and features never-before-released tracks by artists such as Soul Asylum, Bonnie Raitt,<br>Toad the Wet Sprocket, Matthew Sweet, Ulali, Indigo Girls, Bruce Cockburn, Victoria Williams, Rusted Root, Exene Cervenka, Luka Bloom, <br>Jane Siberry, Latin Playboys, Indigenous, John Trudell, Keith Secola, Joy Harjo and Poetic Justice, Sherman Alexie, Frank Hyde, and <br>Reversing Hour. <br>All of the proceeds for Honor will benefit the HTE campaign and directly support Indigenous groups working to protect their communities <br>from environmental threats. Its an awesome compilation of intense yet enjoyable music and spoken word.  <br>Call up your local radio station and put in a request for some tracks to be played, if you're interested.  It's a good way to check out <br>the material and spread some awareness at the same time.<br>If you want more information about Honor the Earth or any of its effects or goals you can write to me at "cgohn@olympus.net" and I'll <br>send you some information, or you can contact the actual network center by posting to "honor@dexmn.com".<br>You can also check out the HTE website at "http://www.honorearth.com".  Look around, investigate and have fun.  Remember that action<br>can be taken here.  Motivate yourself. <p>Thanks so much for your support and happy holidays.<br>Greta Gohn<p>"Honor the Earth is not just another environmental cause. The basic issues of human rights, justice and our own survival are at stake...<br>this campaign is a way to become part of the solution to the environmental threats facing our planet." -Amy Ray <p>

Posted by <a href="mailto:Milos.Hammer@vsb.cz">Milos Hammer</a> on December 26, 1996 at 05:19:46:<p>
Dear Sirs,<br>thank you for a chance to look at your beatiful web page. Hopefully I approach the right company with the product I want to distribute in the USA.<br>In case that you find this product interesting enough, please contact me on the e-mail address above for further information.<br>sincerely<br>Milos Hammer<br>Czech Republic, Europe.<br>E-mail:Milos.Hammer@vsb.cz<br>Products Description><br>VERMI-SOL 1<br>Manufacturing:<br>VERMI-SOL 1 is to be manufactured by means of special three-phase bio-technology. The substance is bio-humus based on organic wastes treated by Californian Earthworms. The substance passes the digestive tract of the earthworms where it is transormed in a very complicated way. Biological active componds are extracted with special extractor. Subsequent two production phases are to be performed in special technology line and are patented, that is why it represents top secret.<br>VERMI-SOL 1 is the product which do not contain any undesirable chemical componds.<br>VERMI-SOL 1 is a pellucid, light brown liquid with characteristic odour. Product is not toxic, has no corrosive effects, it is incombustible. <p>Composition:<br>VERMI-SOL 1 contains soil and leaf activators, growth conditioners, macro-elements (N, P, K), mezo-elements (Ca, Fe, Mg), micro-elements (Zn, Cu, Mn). Furthermore it contains several free amino-acods, vitamines, phyto-regulators, phyto-hormons, enzymes and auxins present in trace concentrations and  are the main effective substances of the preparate for their high biologic activity. VERMI-SOL 1 involves organic humine acids and fluor acids.<br>pH factor is of 4.0 - 6.0.<br>Minimum dry matter content is of 10 g/l.<br>The main material is substance FACTIN, which represents 18 free amino-acids a 4 enzymes. FACTIN has been tested and analysed by Institute of Physiology in Prague. The certificate of research workers was unambiguous!<br>"The preparate involves new free amino-acids a 2 enzymes, which up till now are not known to research workers worldwide. As a final result we can declare that VERMI-SOL 1 consists all biologic necessary substances needed for the development and growth of plant cells.<p>The chemical composition is mentioned in all folders based on the manufacturing standard No.00194 approved by the Ministry of Health of Czech Republic, dated 01.10.1994 .<br>N	min. 500 mg/l<br>K 	min. 3000 mg/l<br>Mg	min. 300 mg/l<br>Zn	0.2 - 0.3 mg/l<br>P	min. 300 mg/l<br>Ca	min. 450 mg/l<br>Fe	1.15 - 1.25 mg/l<br>Cu	0.1 - 0.3 mg/l<br>Radioactivity is of 0.25 Bg/kg<p>VERMI-SOL 1 has pesticide, fungicide and insecticide effects.<p>Range of Application:<br>VERMI-SOL 1 is determined especially for field products, trees and flowers.<p>It acts to:<br>exchange and sorption ability of  nutriments<br>improves the quality of soil and its regeneration, increases the growth regulation effect<br>has possitive impact for sprouting of seeds, taking up and groth of plants<br>it is an important factor of the stucture of partial earths within the soil<br>it supports the arising of  chelators which results in chelate bonds of nutriment ions that prevents from their precipitation and washing ashore<br>mumus substances have the influence for the growth of plants and have photo-sanitary effects<br>biologic active substances stimulate the development of plants having the affirmative influence to the quantity and nutrition value of plants<br>decreases the nitrate content within the plants, especialy in fruits and vegetables<br>increases the content of vitamines, mainly C vitamine content<br>improves effectively the imunology systm of the plant, plant is health and well shields especialy against moulds<br>the affected plant may be recoverd to health via more frequent application<br>it has anti-shoct properties, i.e. allows earlier adaptation to the plant, e.g. for transplantation<br>supports the creation of more stout and healthy root system<br>keeps the balance among the water content, soil air ans optimum size of soil aggregates<br>accelerates the degradation of chemical componds and salts the accumulation of which allows serious damage in plant growth<br>accelerates the growth and especially the green elevated part of the plant<br>plant and fruits are healthy, without residues in leaves and fruits<br>do not create and leave the residues<br>it has not mutagenous properties<br>after the application immediatelly functions throught the plant cells to the overall organism<br>after 2 hous from application the preparate may not be washed away by rain<p>The results of analyses of micro-biologic purity and toxicity of the VERMI-SOL 1 product series show their absolute harmless for people, animals, bees, plants and the environment.<p>VERMI-SOL 1 has been analysed and tested by Research Institutes as folows:<br>UKZUS of Prague-Bchovice					08.02.1995<br>Ministry of Health of Czech Republic				21.10.1994<br>Head Office of the Chief-Sanitary Officer,Prague		25.10.1994<br>Ministry of Agriculture of Czech Republic, UKZUS 	14.02.1995<br>Honeybee Research Institute, Libice nad Vltavou		29.09.1994 <br>UKZUS, Dept. Of Agro-Chemistry				26.09.1994<p>VERMI-SOL 1 Applications<br>First field applications to the plants has been performed as follows:<br>V ECOREX, Mr. Herman and Mrs. Vrnkov<br>fields of EKOEN of ele<br>fields of Bulhary co-operative farm<br>Agricultural Research Institute, doc. Herman<br>Agricultural University, Dept. Beclav, garden application, doc. ufnek<br>Agricultural Research Instiutute Prague-epy, Mr. Jelnek<br>area of fruit trees in Vykov district - Mr. Berki, chairman of Gardening Association<br>vegetables - Mr. Svojanovsk, representatnt of Czech Gardening Association<p>As an introduction to the application is to be emphasized following:<br>Large scale application of mineral fertilizers and pesticides, which temporary enabled to increase the production of agricultural cultures resulted in plant growing in critical situation. Humus forfeits from the soil, soil converts to lifeless mass which does not withstand to wind and water erosion.<br>Chemical componds being a part of industrial fertilizers sterilize the soil and suppres its nutriants. Soil loses the ability of natural regeneration of the yield and products that are provided are oversaturated with chemical componds, often dangerous ones (heavy metals, etc.)<br>That is why it is necessary to apply a new type of fertilizing which will enrich the soil with biologic components needed for the regeneration of fertility and in the same time provides necessary nutrients. The fertilization as a scale for ensurring and improving the life of the plant from the environmental point of view may provide the only support for soil life, its imroved supply with substances and keeping the best condition for soil life. The fertilizers must be supplied to the soil and well distributed into regular strata. Fertilizer may not damage the the soil life as well as plant roots, but it may not result in unefficiency of soil parts.<br>In nature system there is the soil life supplied primary from plant roots, secondary from the surface layer of organic residues, to which belngs the excrements, dead bodies of animals and mineral solutions of the soil.<br>The base of envirinmental friendly fertilization are organic fertilizers and their correct application represent the main pillars of successful environmental agriculture. Especially gardening enterprises without sufficient cattle raising are thrown upon the purchase of different organic fertilizers. Such enterprises upon the purchase of organic fertilizers has to tak into account that said fertilizers do not involve heavy metals, biocides, residues of medicaments, etc.<br>All the above criteria meet the fertilizers of VERMI-SOL  series.<p>Under the term growing and development of plants we understand increasing the number of  cells and their size, which may be quantified by means of objective factors - weight, rate and number.<br>The yield of plants are created with known life processes during the ontogenezy. That is why the yield is represented by the relation: soil - plant - climate.<br>By means of VERMI-SOL  we may treat/tend the plant cell as well as the soil edaphon.<p>One of articles involved in the Research Institute Report:<br>" The dosing is recomended within the large range, increasing of the yield, early harvesting and the quality of products reached the values resulted in wonder and mistrust."<br>Application is recomended through spraying diluted VERMI-SOL with water  in the rates 1 : 50, 1 : 100, with usual spraying agricultural machines and devices. For green house applications we recomend watering and/or  TURBOFOGGER aerosol device produced by PULSFOG.<p>VERMI-SOL 1 WE RECOMEND TO BE APPLIED FOR:<br>grains, root-crops, rape, vegetables, corn both for seed and ensilage, grapevine, fruit trees, leaf and coniferous trees, garden and room flowers. Furhtermore VERMI-SOL 1 may be applied to "spinning plants", root and aromatic plants, grass, single and double year forage crops.<p>Application:<br>conservative with 1 application of VERMI-SOL 1<br>combined with VERMI-SOL 1<br>VERMI-SOL 1 only<p>ad 1) During the vegetation period we apply usual industrial fertilizers and preparates agains the pests and sicknesses. The only one spray with VERMI-SOL 1within 14 - 21 days before expected date of harvesting, dose 5 - 8 l/ha, dilution 1 : 100 for increasing the yield and quality of product<p>ad 2) Dose in pure nutrients based on the kind of plant 10 - 40 kg/ha, two applications of VERMI-SOL 1.

I am an aspiring Marine/Ecology Biologist.  I am a freshman attending<br>Millersville University, Millersville, PA.  I am inquiring about how I can<br>get hands-on-experience as I am going through college?  I am looking for<br>either a job or volunteer work.  Anything that will get me the experience.<br>My goal in life is to research and improve any and all varieties of <br>wildlife.  Otherwise we may not have any wildlife left to enjoy.  Hope to<br>here from someone.  Thank you for your time in this matter.<br>

Id like to draw your attention to our homepage which contains information about the remote sensing/GIS work we do within the environment <br>field, including work on automatic oil slick detection, sea ice mapping, ocean front feature extraction amongst others.<p>Homepage URL: http://www.eos.co.uk<p><br>We also have a demonstration of a catalogue and browse system (CBS).<br>CBS is a flexible, low cost system providing instant visibility and user access to holders of spatial data, <br>including aerial and remotely sensed data via the World Wide Web (WWW).  CBS allows users the capability to search for data both temporally and spatially, <br>as well as searching using additional parameters defined by the data archive e.g cloud cover, orbit no, path/row. etc.  <br>Unique search functionality includes a global map interface with user-defined polygon searching and complex temporal <br>searches such as searching for annual repeating time periods.   CBS provides  the ability to browse the results returned from a query before downloading, requesting or ordering  data. <br>An on-line demonstration of CBS is available at our home page.<p>

O estudo e feito em fragmentos de Mata Atlantica e na area entre eles.<br>      A equipe esta dividida em tres grupos: MORCEGOS, roedores/marsupiais e plantas. Meu grupo, MORCEGOS, esta enfrentando um serio problema de falta de recursos financeiros. Os outros tres grupos tem ajuda da inciativa privada.<br>      A pesquisa com os morcegos (principalmente Carollia e Artibeus) comecou depois do inicio do projeto (em 1995).<br>      Peco encarecidamente, que alguem interessado em nos ajudar (patrocinando ou indicando possiveis patrocinadores), nos contacte pelo meu e-mail: jacyrmarco@ibm.net .<br>      De antemao, agradeco pela atencao.<br>     <br>                                         Marco Aurelio Ribeiro de Mello <br>

Workshop on the impacts of Climate Change on Flora and Fauna<p>Summary<p>A workshop organised by BirdLife International and WWF on the impacts of Climate Change on flora and fauna is being planned for autumn 1997. Though the data and venue of the workshop have yet to be decided, a scientific programme is currently being put together. The workshop will focus on predicted and observed floral and faunal changes consequent upon climate change. The aims of the workshop are to: EDUCATE (to bring all delegates up to the same high level of knowledge on the subject), ORIENTATE (to decide what research to do next) and DISSEMINATE (produce a report to be used for informing delegates at the Climate Convention in Kyoto in December 1997).<p>How you can help?<p>If you have undertaken research in the field of the impacts of climate change on flora and fauna then you may be able to help us put the scientific programme together. If you wish to participate in the workshop, you may be able to help us decide when and where it should be held. If you are interested, please email barnaby.briggs@rspb.org.uk<p>

Ladies and Gentlemen,<p>   I'm a brazilian student of Biological Sciences at the UFRJ (Federal <br>University of Rio de Janeiro),and I'm working in the Population Ecology Lab.<br>   We are doing a research called "Effects of forest fragmentation in small<br>mammals and plants populations in the biological reserve of Poco das Antas -<br>RJ". We study seed dispersal, population dynamics and viability.<br>   The lab's team is divided in three groups: BATS, rodents/marsupials, and<br>plants. There's total cooperation between the parts. I'm working with bats,<br>and my group has a big problem: lack of money (the government only gives the<br>lab. The other two teams have private helpers. The research on bats started <br>after they gained sponsors.<br>   We need desperatly that anyone interested to help contact us by the email<br>(jacyrmarco@ibm.net). Our work is impossible without minimal resources.<br>   Thanks for the attention.<br>                                        Marco Aurelio Ribeiro de Mello<p>

Posted by <a href="mailto:a681426k@edinboro.edu">Amy Kuhn</a> on December 02, 1996 at 06:32:21:<p>
My Environmental Studies Club at Edinboro University of PA is looking into<br>getting environmental speakers (preferably inexpensively) to come to campus<br>next spring.  Our main environmental concern right now is recycling, but <br>everything else is interesting to us and we hope it is to the student body<br>as well.  We hope to find things that would attract some people who don't <br>already know what we as environmentalists know and people who might not <br>even be interesed otherwise.  Does anyone have any suggestions of where we <br>can find lots of speakers (or films)?  We hope to do a series in April of <br>presentations for a month-long Earth Day celebration.<p>Thanks, <br>Amy<br>a681426k@edinboro.edu

You can obtain free  expert speakers by contacting EPA of Pa., your county, city and state environmental conservation or protection agencies. Finally, invite other large environmental groups in PA to address your forums.

      I have about 2,700 t-shirts/sweatshirts to sell.. Over 2,000 <br>are screen-printed (most with beautiful full-color environmental <br>images). The sayings on the shirts are many, and are such as:<br>   <br>   Save the Rainforest,     Save the Calif Redwoods<br>   Save our Seas,         Save our Tropical Treasures   <br>   Protect our Farm Animals,       Yosemite<br>   Endangered means there is still time,  ETC.<p>   These shirts have been actively wholesaled at $7.50 and retailed <br>at $14-15 (more for the sweats) the past 2-3 yrs.  I want to sell <br>all or any significant part of them at a considerable discount to <br>wholesale. ALL offers will be considered..!!!<br>  <br>   They are mostly colored shirts and name brands like Hanes, Oneita,<br>Fruit of the Loom, etc.  There are both Adult and Youth sizes.  About<br> 650 are blank.  Very few of the blanks are white..most are colors.<p>    Please let me know if you have any interest.  The shirts are <br>located in So. San Francisco.<p>    Thanks,<br>    Stan Fetterman<br>    StanFe@aol.com

I am looking for information about the Carter Orchard in Clarksboro, NJ, specifically their pesticide history, and the Helen Kramer Landfill in Mantua, NJ. Also information on cancer rates in Gloucester County, NJ. Any advice on where to look would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

I'm a writer doing a piece on eco-carpets for a national magazine. Has <br>anyone out there experienced allergic reactions to chemical fumes <br>from carpeting, what did you do, and how can you find carpets that <br>don't exude chemicals?

Hi Judy--I am a Naturalist Interior Decorator <br>'Specializing in Healthier Homes'. I am located in<br>Minneapolis, Minnesota. 65% of my <br>client/customer base are people suffering from<br>MCS (multiple chemical sensitivities). My main<br>products sold to these people are A.) Non-Toxic<br>Organic Cotton Mattresses which we drop ship<br> worldwide (made in California since the 1940's) <br>and B.) Earthguard Carpeting-made of 80% <br>recycled PET (recycled polyester clothing & pop<br>bottles) with a 20% nylon. The new carpet smell<br>isn't there as these polyester fibres have been<br>previously offgassed. Hence, SAFE CARPETING.<br>Two Mills to date are producing these carpets. <br>There may be others beginning to as we speak, <br>but none come close to the high-end quality that<br>Earthguard has. Call me & I can discuss further.<br>Susan J. Mielke Designs  1-612-521-8635 CST<br>(Note; my addition to the webdirectory-bb under <br>non-toxic organic cotton mattresses)-Thanks!<p><br> <br>

Posted by <a href="mailto:grian@global.california.com">Grian</a> on November 24, 1996 at 16:25:05:<p>
  Hello....Please, I need someone out there to assist me in either finding or supplying me with a couple of URL's.  Some background in case it may assist you in knowing exactly what sites I need to reach.  Danaan Parry/Founder & brother in the trenches of an organization called "The 'Earthstewards' Network" died suddenly of a massive heart attack on Thursday November 14,1996. His home and the headquarters was in Bainbridge Island, Washington, USA.  The Earthstewards Network is a world-wide neteork of individuals committed to doing their part to preserve the eartha dn assure human survival.  Earthstewards Network programs emphasize the ability of each individual to make a difference.  One on Danaan's projects has been The Earthstewards Network's "Peace Trees" which has brought youth from all over the world to plant trees, and in the process, learn leadership skills and lessons in intercultural cooperation.  Peace Trees have been planted in India, the Middle East, Central America, Los Angeles, New York, Sonoma, and Washington D.C.  The latest Peace trees project, Earstewards' 20th, involved the removal of land mines in Viet Nam and the planting of a Peace Park in the former Demilitarized Zone.  Danaan and a team of de-mining experts had made a clean sweep of the mines last month.  In late Novembeer he was to co-lead a delegation of Earthstewards to plant the trees and build a Land Mine Awareness Center.  The co-leader of the project is his wife, Jerilyn Brusseau.  A memorial service was held November 20th at Seattle's Unity Church and then yesterday in Tiburon/California S.F. Bay Area at the Community Congregational Church.  His wife and the 1996 Vietnam Peace Trees deligation left for Vietnam November 23rd to carry on Danaan's work.  I was told that there is a URL involving the Vietnam Peace Trees that has a memorial page or blurb re: Danaan's passing and a letter that he wrote in late September on his flight back from completeing the final readiness for the Vietnam Peace Trees that is going on as I write.  PLEASE, if anyone knows of the any URL's that might get me closer to finding not only a memorial to Danaan (does Earthstewards have a URL?) but information on the current Vietnam Peace Trees site please Email as soon as possible.  In parting I would like to share what the Earthstewards' commitment states in part.:  "When we recognize that our planet itself is a living organism co-evolving with humankind, we shall become worthy of stewardship.  When we experience our oneness-our total connectedness of all beings, we shall be at peace with our own hearts".  Danaan also wrote the "Essene Book of Meditations and Blessings" geared on a daily and seasonal communion with Gaia.  Thank you.  Grian<br>

The island state of Tasmania sits off Australias south-eastern edge like a jewel.  It boasts natural beauty on a grand scale.  Rugged mountains that in places meet the sea; wild rivers carrying waters from pristine highland lakes and Gondwanan forests of giant trees and ancient flora.  Tasmania is a place where nature seems to have a slight edge over civilization.<p>The ordered beauty of the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens in the capital, Hobart, are a tranquil contrast to the states wilderness areas.  Established in 1818, its extensive tree collection contains many rare and endangered species.  The conifer collection is the largest in the southern hemisphere with some species facing extinction in their country of origin.<p>The gardens are a reminder to visitors of Tasmanias colonial past and a country the locals once called home.  Those early horticulturalists and gardeners could not have known they planted the seeds of oak, chestnut, elm and birch trees in ground which would one day harbour their killer.<p>In an unprecedented step, the Tasmanian people have been asked to help save their gardens.  Scientists and experts working to eradicate the Armillaria fungus are in a race against time.<p>For more information, please pay a visit to the following web site:<p>http://www.clandh.com.au/rtbg/index.htm<p>or email the gardens directly at: rtbg@ice.net.au<p>If you are the owner or administrator of a web-site or have your own home-page and would like to help out, please set up a link to point to the above mentioned URL and send us your sites URL via reply email.  You may be helping to save the lives of many endangered trees which, given the chance, will still be there for many future generations to enjoy.<p>Public Matters, on behalf of the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens Appeal.<br>

Posted by <a href="mailto:msi@intex.net">Robert L. Taylor</a> on November 20, 1996 at 15:44:33:<p>
I am a telecommunications power systems consultant who sees the need and urgency to address storage battery installations found in many building complexes.  In my travels, I encourage my industry to be proactive and address the safety, health, and environmental aspects of lead-acid batteries installed in their facilities. Telephone central offices alone are estimated to house over fifteen million (15,000,000) gallons of sulfuric acid in this country.  The hardest question for me to answer (it is also the most asked) is if battery system spill control is so important, why aren't they hearing about it and being required to do something.  I assure them it is in their best interest to take the lead and not wait for something  to happen as in the L. A. Grand fire.  I am contacting you to further understand the dynamics of the fire inspection process when it comes to battery system safety and health issues including the enforcement of fire code law.<p>I appreciate an article written by Scott Stooky, Austin, Texas Fire Protection Engineering, entitled: "An Analysis of the Uniform Fire Code Requirements for Stationary Lead-acid Battery Systems." His position on the need for spill control in lead-acid battery plants further reinforces my position to the need.<p>What I seem to be finding throughout the United States is a general unawareness of the presence of batteries and their associated hazards.  Since the Uniform Fire Code is used directly by over half of our nation and is influential in the remaining half, I use the Uniform Fire Code (UFC) as my reference.<p>From this code and experiences in the field, I offer the following scenario:<p>1.  Many medium and large Group B Occupancy Facilities contain lead-acid batteries with a total liquid capacity exceeding UFC Health and Physical Hazard Maximum Quantities per Control Area.<br>2.  There is little industry awareness that batteries contain hazardous materials including sulfuric acid and lead compounds.<br>3.  Lead-acid batteries are seldom listed on the Hazardous Materials Inventory Statement (HMIS).<br>4.  Since lead-acid batteries are generally not found on the HMIS, there is no lead-acid battery system Hazardous Materials Management Plan (HMMP).<br>5.  Since there is no lead-acid battery HMMP, employee awareness and related hazardous materials training and materials are not in place.<br>6.  Since there is no HMMP on file, fire departments may not be fully aware or prepared in the event of a fire or emergency in one of these facilities (LA Grand Fire - 1994).<br>7.  1995 Uniform Fire Code Article 64 awareness or use as an Alternate Method to adopted law Article 80 provisions appears to be minimal.<p>There are relatively low to minimal cost solutions being offered that address battery system spill control and cleanup.<p>I desire to further understand the dynamics of the fire inspection process when it comes to battery system safety and health issues including the enforcement of fire code law.  Also, I am pleased to find out that the Dallas Fire Department is requiring spill control per Article 64 as an alternate method to Article 80 in the Uniform Fire Code.<p>I would appreciate receiving any information regarding your position and activities being undertaken by your organization.<p>Sincerely,<p>Bob Taylor<br>4532 Hitching Post Lane<br>Plano, TX  75024<p>Tel:  972-618-9630<br>Fax:  972-618-8938<br>Email:  msi@intex.net<br>

A case of inhaling the gas produced by lead-acid<br>batteries (when being overcharged and heated<br>by overcharging)has been reported to me.  Subse-<br>quently I began researching the effects of inhaling<br>this gas.<p>Do you have any info on the effects of such a <br>condition?<p>Thank you<p>Buck Buchanan

Posted by John R Littlewood on November 18, 1996 at 04:59:25:<p>
I am a PhD research student just starting my research at the University of Glamorgan, South Wales, Britain.  My three year rsearch program stems from a report published by the D.o.E in the spring of 1996.  It stipulates the need for 4.5 million new homes in the UK in the next twenty years.  Therefore, the reason for undertaking my research is to investigate whether earth shelterd housing can provide a more sustainable and environmentally sound alternative to traditional house building techniques within the UK.<br>The aims of my report are as follows: (i) To determine whether it is feasible to design, develop and consrtuct earth sheltered houses for the mass market and consequently to establish the potential for earth sheltered communities within urban and rural areas. (ii) To locate a site suitable for devloping a number of earthy sheltered houses, design and then develop these houses/units.<br>The first part of my project is to review existing earth sheltered houses whether built as individual units or incoporated into developments.  Additionally, to assess public opnion surrounding different developments of earth sheltered houses.<br>Therefore, any information anyone could send me relating to single earth sheltered houses or multiple devlopment earth sheltered houses which are located any where in the world would be gratefully received.<br>

Good Luck with your research, John. I believe the University of Minnisota still offers two books on Earth sheltered housing. Theyre the best sources I've come across yet. I believe the dept at the univ is called "The Minnisota Space Center" or something to that effect. Their book on designs shows many finished houses which fit the environment admirably. Plans are varied according to site conditions, ie: flat, hillside, sunside front, sunside back, etc. Hope you find this valuable.

I have researched earth-sheltered housing designs for teh last 20 years and am entirely in favor of the concept for a myriad of reasons.  I am currently commencing building some small test models in central Texas.  will keep you posted.  Good luck with your research.  Jim.

Hi, I just wanted to let you know that you are sharing<br>this earth with women too- so the next time that you <br>address a letter you might want to consider this fact.<br>You are going to miss out on a lot of information if<br>you do not ask the other half of the population.<p>Thank you, Jessica Marshall and Sarah Pfaefflin<br>

Posted by <a href="mailto:tbusiahn@win.bright.net">Tom Busiahn</a> on November 10, 1996 at 11:42:50:<p>
Private property rights are fundamental to American society, and are<br>protected under the 5th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  However, <br>some uses of private property have infringed on other fundamental rights <br>not equally protected under law.  The Preamble to the Constitution declares <br>as one of its purposes to "secure the blessings of Liberty to ourselves <br>and our Posterity".  Shouldn't these blessings include the right to breathe <br>clean air, drink clean water, and right of posterity to the fundamental <br>ecological processes that sustain life?  We propose to establish a clear<br>distinction between private property and common property (those things that<br>by their nature cannot be owned by a person or corporation) by amending the<br>U.S. Constitution as follows:<p>COMMON PROPERTY AMENDMENT (a.k.a. SEVENTH GENERATION AMENDMENT)  <br>"The right of citizens of the United States to use and enjoy air, water,<br>sunlight, and other renewable resources determined by the Congress to be<br>common property shall not be impaired, nor shall such use impair their<br>availability for the use of future generations"<p>If you want more information, or if you want to work in support of the<br>amendment, e-mail me at tbusiahn@win.bright.net, or write to<br>The Seventh Generation Committee<br>1200 Ellis Avenue<br>Ashland, WI  54806<p>PROTECT OUR COMMON PROPERTY FOR THE SEVENTH GENERATION!<p><br>

Posted by <a href="mailto:Suz18@ix.netcom.com">Suzanne Albulak</a> on November 09, 1996 at 11:20:54:<p>
I live on Long Island, and in my community there has been a noncommittal,<br>undefinitive attempt to get people to stop feeding bread and donuts to <br>the ducks, geese and swans--as it has been deemed to be bad for these <br>birds nutritionally, as well as causing rat infestation around the waters <br>where they live.  In a couple of places signs have been posted by the <br>county board of health imploring people not to feed birds food that is bad <br>for them--but these signs are flagrantly ignored.  I guess the popular <br>consensus is that birds have traditionally been fed a staple of bread, and<br>that such admonitions are nonsense.  <p>I have tried various times to reach the person who is in charge of one of<br>the areas I'm concerned about--but he hasn't returned my calls.  My next <br>step is to get in touch with a local environmental group--apparently one<br>of them is trying to provide nutritional food pellets on site at another pond.  <br>If anyone has any suggestions I would greatly appreciate it.<p>Thanks<br>Suzanne Albulak <br>

Hi there!  I am  recent graduate of Alaska Pacific University having earned a B.A. in Environmental Science. I have had experience with both the USGS and Fish and Wildlife, along with local environmental NGO's.  I am seeking an entry level position in environmental science that is challenging and exciting.  I live in Anchorage and would love to stay in this amazing state, but I am willing to relocate for that neccesary job experience.

The Redberry Pelican Project Research Station at Redberry Lake in Saskatchewan Canada is looking for graduate students interested in using the lake, migratory bird sanctuary and the research station facilities and support to conduct research projects involving the limnology of saline lakes, the geology of Great Plains pothole (kettlehole) lakes, and a variety of endangered species. For a glimpse at the organization, visit our web page at http://redbay.com/redpel.<br>The RPP Technical Committee reviews all projects before accepting them, and may consider assisting project proponents to achieve funding support, although there is no implied guarantee of funding. We welcome all questions.
