<H3><B> DEUTSCHE TELECOM </B></H3>


<H2> <B>Telekom rules OK</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>The flotation of Deutsche Telekom was
fenced by a thicket of regulations and employed more lawyers than syndicate
staff. So how did Deutsche Morgan Grenfell get away with breaking so many of its
own rules? And did the three global coordinators &#173; DMG, Dresdner Bank and
Goldman Sachs &#173; allow themselves to be manipulated by a greedy issuer? None
of this bodes well for Telekom 2. Laura Covill reports</B> </H4> 

<P> For Ronaldo
Schmitz, the highlight of the deal came right at the start.

<P> Just after German unification, the board member for corporate finance at
Deutsche Bank was summoned to Bonn to meet Christian Schwarz-Schilling, then
federal post and telecommunications minister.

<P> The minister came straight to the point. How much money could be raised by
floating the telephone service on the stock exchange?

<P> Even, asked Schmitz, if the government retained a capital stake?

<P> Yes, we want to privatize fully later, Schwarz-Schilling responded. How much?

<P> It was an impossible question to answer. The telephone service was still a
tax-exempt public monopoly, its true financial situation could only be guessed at
and the German telecoms market would soon have to be opened up to competition.
Difficult to imagine any serious investor buying stock. But Schmitz was
determined to give a straightforward reply, and an optimistic one.

<P> In that case, the banker estimated, around Dm15 billion.

<P> Elated, Schwarz-Schilling initiated plans for the initial public offering
(IPO) of Germany's telecoms monopoly as soon as possible. The Bundespost's humble
telephone division was renamed Deutsche Telekom.

<P> A lot was at stake for the government and Telekom's new chief executive, Ron
Sommer, appointed in 1995. Raising so much capital could transform the financial
prospects of a company which &#173; as a BZW research report famously put it
&#173; is loaded with more debt than the Republic of Turkey. Furthermore an IPO
on that scale might finally create an equity-owning culture in Germany.

<P> For the banks, fee earnings of around Dm500 million ($326.8 million), plus
the prestige attached to Europe's largest-ever equity offering, which in the end
raised Dm20 billion, were up for grabs. The lobbying of Telekom for underwriting
roles reached a peak in 1994, when several European banks revealed ambitions to
become leading players in international investment banking. The most ambitious
and aggressive was Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG) under Ronaldo Schmitz.

<P> Schmitz knew from his years of negotiations with the government and his
growing understanding of Sommer that the government and Telekom were determined
to make this quasi-privatization a success, even if the banks lost a lot of money
in the process.

<P> <B>Led by the nose?</B>

<P> Having established a rapport with the government and Telekom, Schmitz was
determined to make the deal a financial and strategic success by defending the
bank's interests every step of the way. Some say that route led DMG to abuse its
leading underwriting position to breach the rules on an unprecedented scale;
others believe that all the banks involved were led by the nose by an autocratic
issuer.

<P> Whichever is true, the ultimate responsibility for what happened must lie
with the management of Deutsche Telekom. Finance director Joachim Kr&ouml;ske, in
the job since 1990, was regarded as capable but unremarkable. Bankers' chief
concern during the deal was that he would mix up the figures (which he never
did); they also worried that his fragile health might suffer under the strain of
the two-year marathon. The IPO project manager, Helmut Reuschenbach, recruited
from the finance division at Daimler-Benz, was regarded as competent and
trustworthy, but no great strategist.

<P> So the real mastermind was Sommer himself, a German-Israeli with a background
as head of Sony Europe. Described by admiring bankers as a marketing genius,
Sommer persuaded investors to buy Telekom on its image and potential. It was
Sommer who turned the Telekom share into a new brand name.

<P> Sommer used the feel-good factor to create enthusiasm among retail investors,
spending some Dm100 million advertising the IPO. The next step was to persuade
institutions to buy the share on the back of non-price-sensitive retail demand
and in anticipation of its future performance, without looking too hard at the
fundamentals.

<P> The second marketing tactic was to guarantee a substantial dividend for 1996
and 1997. Third, Sommer managed to persuade the Stock Exchange committee to give
Telekom a weighting of nearly 5% in the German 30-share Dax index, more than it
strictly warrants on the basis of its subscribed capital.

<P> As a result Dm5 billion worth of Telekom's total nominal capital of Dm12.5
billion contributes to the Dax weighting even though less than two-thirds of that
is actually subscribed &#173; even after the 20% increase in the issue's volume.
Strictly speaking, it was illogical, but the Dax weighting obliged index
investors to buy the stock.

<P> Even the grey market (unofficial pre-market) in Telekom shares that opened as
soon as the bookbuilding range was announced was depicted as an advantage for the
issuer. Some of Telekom's bankers argued that grey-market prices averaging around
Dm35 a share showed that investors valued Telekom far above the bookbuilding
range of between Dm25 and Dm30.

<P> But not all the banks were happy with these tactics. Many would have
preferred Telekom to focus on the fundamentals, even though these were not as
favourable. Not a single banker or analyst believed, for instance, that the price
range was justified by the fundamentals alone. After all, Telekom still has debts
of Dm100 billion, 37,000 staff too many and charges that are among the highest in
the world. What's more, the company has scarcely been exposed to competition in a
telecoms market that is still only partly deregulated. To stay in control,
Telekom needed as much authority as possible over the syndicate.

<P> Throughout the deal, all the syndicate banks felt Telekom's heavy hand. The
regional bookrunners &#173; Dresdner Bank in Germany, SBC Warburg in the UK,
Paribas in continental Europe, Goldman Sachs in north America and Daiwa for Asia
and the rest of the world &#173; were given the task of disciplining other banks
in their tranche, judging them and making allocations on that basis.

<P> Performance was one criterion: how pre-marketing was conducted, and what
quality of orders were generated. But equally important was the banks' conduct,
which meant not breaking the myriad rules on publicity, research and contacting
investors.

<P> Firm dates were set for pre-marketing to start and for the bookbuilding
period, which coincided with roadshows in 30 cities worldwide.

<P> No syndicate bank was allowed to speak to journalists or analysts except on
those exceptional occasions when they had an agreed message to transmit. Analysts
from all syndicate banks were obliged to submit their research reports to the
company before publication. Syndicate analysts remain gagged until the end of
1996, even though trading in Telekom stock has begun.

<P> Syndicate banks were told that the rules had not been invented by Telekom, or
by the global coordinators. It was merely normal procedure for the US securities
watchdog, the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC), because the Telekom
share was also being floated on the New York Stock Exchange. In practice, it
seems the SEC's guidelines were interpreted as strictly as possible, while
lawyers from Telekom and the global coordinators re-stated those rules every week
to emphasize their importance. For Telekom, it was a highly effective way to
control the syndicate banks and restrict the flow of information about the
company.

<P> Even if the rules came from the SEC, the penalties were invented by Telekom.
According to the detailed rulebooks sent to the entire syndicate, any bank found
breaking the rules would be ejected from the syndicate and also put at a
disadvantage in its attempts to win future government mandates.

<P> Telekom also took an active interest in the global coordinators' staff. Bernd
von Maltzan lost his job as head of German investment banking at DMG early in
1996, but was kept on the Telekom deal at the client's request. By autumn he was
working in an entirely different business, as head of international private
banking, but his presence at the roadshows was nevertheless required.

<P> <B>Imposing discipline</B>

<P> The more banks that were involved, the more effectively Telekom's rules could
be applied to the banking community as a whole. Thus Telekom was keen to invite
as many banks as possible into the syndicate. German merchant banks Schr&ouml;der
M&uuml;nchmeyer Hengst and Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt had not solicited places but
found it impossible to say no after being approached by Telekom.

<P> Even the advisers &#173; NM Rothschild for the company and Credit Suisse
First Boston (CSFB) for the government &#173; were given bit-parts in the
syndicate. Thus Telekom achieved not only the broadest coverage of the investor
market but also won the right to impose discipline on practically the entire
international banking community.

<P> The only two notable institutions left out were BZW and Rabobank; both later
played a significant role in the grey market.

<P> The three global coordinators had special obligations. Deutsche and Dresdner
were obliged to reveal the orders they received from captive accounts, such as
the fund providers and insurance companies they own. All orders received by the
three global coordinators were scrutinized for evidence of exaggeration, or
attempts to win additional allocations. Non-lead banks were assured that Telekom
would play an active role in the final allocation to prevent the global
coordinators claiming any special influence.

<P> Furthermore, Telekom insisted that a cap was placed on the allocations to the
global coordinators, with the surplus distributed to all syndicate banks in each
tranche. The cap was supposed to counterbalance the inherent power of the global
coordinators, which complained that the structure of the syndicate was too
democratic and grumbled that the regional bookrunners had far more authority than
usual.

<P> Right at the start, Telekom showed its dominance in the manner the global
coordinators were selected.

<P> At first, Deutsche had looked certain to be the sole global coordinator,
thanks to Schmitz's meeting with Schwarz-Schilling and subsequent consultations
in Bonn. After years of sharing the top slot with Dresdner in all the main German
privatizations from Volkswagen onwards, Deutsche believed it had finally
established its supremacy as the leading German IPO bank.

<P> But then came the partial privatization of Lufthansa in 1994 and the first
beauty contest held by the German finance ministry. Under Hansgeorg Hofmann,
newly arrived as board member responsible for syndicate business, Dresdner won
the Lufthansa deal, and put itself back in the running for Telekom.

<P> While other German banks, including strong contenders such as DG Bank,
Commerzbank and WestLB, were still fighting for a senior place in the German
syndicate, Deutsche and Dresdner had their places as lead managers assured.

<P> At one point, Dresdner was named lead manager for the German tranche. But
Deutsche fought back, persuading Telekom to divide the responsibility. Dresdner
was now responsible for the domestic retail part of the issue, while Deutsche
claimed chief responsibility for approaching German institutions. That division
was partly cosmetic, however, since there was only one German book, and it was in
Dresdner's hands.

<P> Deutsche then played the international card. Dresdner had gained its original
mandate as head of the German tranche by claiming that the bulk of the issue
could and should be placed in the home market. It praised the government's view
that Telekom is a <I>Volksaktie</I> (people's share), which has always been owned
by the German people and should remain in their hands. Thus Dresdner tried to
persuade Telekom and the government to allocate three-quarters or even more of
the stock in Germany, with a majority for retail investors.

<P> But during the lobbying stage Deutsche cleverly undermined the case for a
domestic focus by arguing that prestige and necessity required Europe's
largest-ever IPO be placed globally. Deutsche argued that it had greater
experience and sales reach in international markets than any other German bank.
The implication was clear: Dresdner was relying on the German market because it
did not have sufficient international clout.

<P> Unwittingly, Deutsche may thus have opened the door to Goldman Sachs, which
was unexpectedly appointed as the third global coordinator, reportedly at the
wish of chancellor Helmut Kohl himself. Goldman's main argument was that Telekom
should be placed via a full public offering in the US market, and neither
Deutsche nor Dresdner had the experience to do that. Goldman also brought greater
experience of the global investor market.

<P> Although Deutsche was a global coordinator &#173; and had the intangible but
real advantage of seeing its name at the top left of the syndicate list as
spokesman of the global coordinators &#173; it was at a serious disadvantage to
the other two.

<P> As late as six weeks before the flotation, just before bookbuilding began,
Deutsche Bank suddenly realized the implications of not having its own tranche,
unlike Dresdner in Germany and Goldman in the US. DMG's sales force would have to
distribute its time and energy equally among investors throughout the world and
would have no special status with any one group.

<P> In the US, however, DMG had made substantial progress since being appointed a
global coordinator two years earlier. DMG therefore persuaded Goldman to push for
a larger US tranche than originally intended in the hope that both would get more
allocations in that market. Goldman was only too happy to agree. Dresdner, which
is relatively weak in the US market, found itself outvoted.

<P> <B>Under pressure to perform</B>

<P> The scheme backfired later, when 30% of the stock sold to US investors was
returned to the market during the first two days of trading. The suspicion was
that DMG had exaggerated orders in the US &#173; where it was unlikely to reach
the cap set on its earnings &#173; even though it knew some of those investors
were flippers.

<P> German syndicate banks complained that if German institutions had been
allocated that stock instead, they would not have had to buy in the after-market,
pushing the price up alarmingly to Dm33.90 at the close of trading on the first
day, November 18. Others suspect that a flood of after-market buying was exactly
what Telekom intended.

<P> Deutsche's next objective was to increase its allocation in all the other
tranches. An agreement dating back two years stipulated that Dresdner and
Deutsche should get roughly equal quotas of the whole deal. As bookrunner of the
German tranche, Dresdner could reasonably have expected to win a greater
proportion of the allocation. So it turned out: Dresdner won 25.5% of the German
tranche, with Deutsche one percentage point behind.

<P> To compensate for this expected defeat, Deutsche reserved the theoretical
right to place more internationally. But, in practice, it was by no means certain
that DMG would win more of the deal than Dresdner. And by marketing the share
worldwide instead of having its own home tranche, and by bearing the expense of
coordinating all the books, Deutsche incurred far greater costs. Year-end bonuses
for DMG staff are expected to be higher too.

<P> That &#173; plus its well-known ambition to become a global investment bank
&#173; put DMG under pressure to perform.

<P> About a week before the pre-marketing began, DMG began to call itself sole
global bookrunner &#173; a title it had never officially been given, although it
was responsible for pooling the five regional books. DMG points out that it is
named in the prospectus as "the global bookrunner" and argues that there is no
difference between the two labels.

<P> But DMG salesmen were instructed to stress their bank's status as "sole
global bookrunner" when approaching investors. When pressed about the title's
exact meaning, DMG salesmen are vague, merely pointing out that the bookbuilding
and the final allocation were being carried out at Deutsche's Frankfurt
headquarters.

<P> But everyone in the market knew its significance. Many international
investors are required by charter to subscribe only through the sole global
bookrunner, if one exists.

<P> Rival banks in the syndicate were infuriated when DMG produced a transparent
paperweight bearing the legend "sole global bookrunner" as a gift for
institutional investors.

<P> Moreover, other banks say Deutsche also promised that its status as sole
global bookrunner would give its clients a better chance in the allocation
process. Schmitz is said to have spoken of a private meeting between Telekom and
Deutsche Bank for this purpose during the allocation weekend.

<P> Initially Telekom did not protest. After all, the paperweights had already
been produced and were on their way to investors when the issuer found out about
the scheme. But senior figures at Telekom now accuse DMG of having abused its
position.

<P> The other more serious charge levied at DMG is that it broke the very rules
it had helped to write by jumping the gun to reach investors before the
pre-marketing phase officially began on October 9. This is reported to have
happened almost everywhere, but appears to have been particularly effective in
the UK and Asia.

<P> Although DMG does not deny having approached investors first, it claims it
was forced to do so as a result of a notorious meeting in Bonn on September 30.

<P> Schmitz, Hofmann and Eric Dobkin, head of equity capital markets at Goldman
Sachs, had all been at the IMF/World Bank meeting in Washington when they were
summoned to Telekom's headquarters at short notice. The meeting on that Monday
morning was a gloomy affair. Having heard so many sceptical opinions in
Washington, the bankers were fearful that neither institutional nor retail demand
for the Telekom share would materialize.

<P> According to the bankers, all parties had originally agreed not to propose
any price range for the share until after the pre-marketing had given them a
better indication of investor demand.

<P> But Telekom had its own ideas about a price range, and having just received
the reports from the syndicate banks' analysts, was shocked to find that they did
not tally. Angry Telekom managers demanded that the bankers should agree
immediately to a range of Dm25 to Dm30 and use that as a basis for their talks to
investors.

<P> Dobkin chose this moment &#173; which the others saw as too late &#173; to
open a debate about the valuation of the stock. US investors would value Telekom
on fundamentals, not on technical grounds, Dobkin argued. That was later borne
out at the US roadshows, when German bankers found US institutions unimpressed by
their technical arguments about a ground swell of demand among German retail
investors.

<P> While Goldman's analyst had proposed a price range of Dm20 to Dm25, Telekom
clung to Dm30, the figure first proposed by Kr&ouml;ske two years earlier and
still taken seriously by the government, despite the analysts' view that it was
too high on fundamentals alone.

<P> Dobkin fought for a different view on valuing Telekom as if "it was his own
money", as one participant said. He appeared willing to stake Goldman's entire
mandate on getting his philosophy across.

<P> The German bankers present were troubled because a price of only Dm20 or even
less would be regarded as a serious failure by the government and Deutsche
Telekom's management &#173; not to mention the banks advising them. Telekom
needed to raise substantially more than Dm10 billion. And even though Goldman
Sachs had equal billing as global coordinator, Deutsche and Dresdner knew it was
their joint responsibility to make the flotation succeed and to create an equity
culture in Germany.

<P> So Telekom succeeded in persuading the banks to accept a range of Dm25 to
Dm30 after all. But this landed DMG in a particularly sticky position. Its
research report, recommending a range of Dm20 to Dm30, had been sent out to
investors that morning &#173; it is a moot point whether this early dispatch was
legitimate &#173; whereas Goldman and Dresdner had not yet released their
reports.

<P> In Deutsche's version of the story, this unexpected change of policy at
Telekom forced DMG to contact investors immediately on October 1 to explain the
discrepancy. Other banks &#173; and now Telekom &#173; counter that DMG exploited
that opportunity to sell its Telekom story before the official start of
pre-marketing. The evidence, they say, was the tell-tale presence of the DMG
paperweight on investors' desks.

<P> Placed under pressure from other banks to act even-handedly, Telekom later
punished DMG by reducing its underwriting and management fees in the UK and Asia.
So while DMG had started out with an underwriting allocation of between 9% and
12% of the UK tranche, it ended up with only 9%. Of the 2.5% overall fee, 60% was
selling commission, 20% for underwriting and 20% for management.

<P> <B>Responding to demand</B>

<P> DMG was forced to acknowledge the anger of UK banks in particular: it gave up
several priority accounts in the UK and offered to give NatWest Securities a
greater role in the syndicate. Furthermore, Telekom penalized DMG by reducing its
participation in one-on-one meetings with important investors. DMG disputes this
latter point, saying it gave up only one such meeting (Dresdner did likewise)
because it agreed Merrill Lynch should have two more.

<P> Dobkin had made his point on the valuation issue, but had changed nothing.
Moreover Goldman's fight was not over.

<P> Even before bookbuilding, the issue was already oversubscribed by retail
demand, creating a solid basis for marketing to institutions. More than 3 million
retail investors had signed up for the Share Information Forum to get
preferential allocation rights and the retail discount of 50 pfennigs per share.

<P> Soon the issue was several times oversubscribed. On Saturday November 9,
immediately after the US roadshows, the global coordinators proposed to increase
the issue to allow orders to be allocated more generously and to enable Telekom
to pay off its debt more quickly.

<P> Telekom's senior officers joined the Frankfurt meeting by video conference
and, according to the banks, the only real question was whether Telekom could
afford to honour its dividend pledges on the higher amount. Telekom had evidently
done its homework on that point because the decision to go ahead was quickly
taken.

<P> The issue was increased by 20% to 600 million shares. Even that was not
enough to dampen institutional demand. Kr&ouml;ske, who had suggested a price of
Dm30 a share in the first place, began to talk about going even higher.

<P> The global coordinators were now nervous because Sommer's technical arguments
had succeeded brilliantly with investors. Even after the increase the issue was
more than six times oversubscribed. Thus the demand in the five regional books
would have supported any price, even in excess of Dm30. Goldman had more cause
for concern than ever, but this time Dobkin had the support of Hofmann and
Schmitz.

<P> Placing the responsibility squarely with Telekom, the global coordinators
then refused to recommend an issue price. Any recommendation they made might have
amounted to an obligation to support the after-market at that price. All three
were surprised and relieved when the issuer opted for Dm28.50, a compromise
between retail and institutional demand. They almost forgot that the price was
far higher than any analyst thought prudent.

<P> On October 25, Deutsche broke another of its own rules by issuing a warrant
on Telekom stock. That evening, just as the annual Bankers' Ball in Frankfurt got
under way, members of the German syndicate received an unsigned memo from
Dresdner. They were warned not to attempt to issue a warrant and were told that
Deutsche's warrants had already been withdrawn. Apparently the SEC had warned
Deutsche that its derivatives might scupper the whole deal.

<P> It seems to have been a risky attempt to test the boundaries. Immediately
after the event, DMG said the warrant had been a regrettable mistake, hinting at
a lack of communication between the syndicate and the equity derivatives desk.
Then DMG changed its story and now explains that it decided to launch the warrant
after realizing that several other German syndicate banks were about to do the
same (which has since been confirmed by several members). Rabobank, a
non-syndicate bank, became the first issuer of a Telekom warrant on October 28.

<P> <B>Trouble on the 14th floor</B>

<P> Deutsche claims its own warrant was necessary to control this new market, and
was therefore not strictly against the rules. But it was a strange move from the
leader of a syndicate which later tried and failed to suppress the sale of
Rabobank's warrant and had frowned on the development of the grey market, which
was run by BZW.

<P> As bookbuilding began in late October, Deutsche Bank set up what it called
the "war room" on the 14th floor of its Frankfurt headquarters. Here staff from
all three global coordinators took in data from each of the five regional books
to create a global book.

<P> Relations between the three became tenser than ever. Goldman and Dresdner
complained that the rooms provided for them were dark and poky. DMG's Rudolf
Rhein came to work on October 29 to discover that the combination to his office
adjoining the war room had been changed overnight; Dresdner Bank had somehow
discovered the secret number. Nobody praised the round-the-clock catering
service.

<P> By the final weekend, tempers were frayed and all the main syndicate staff
were tired of each other. Some declared that it had become impossible to work
together. DMG was blamed for slapdash organization of the final few syndicate
meetings; many smaller meetings that were scheduled never took place.

<P> To the relief of all concerned, the decision to set the issue price at
Dm28.50 was taken in a few minutes on Friday, November 15. But the final
allocation meeting &#173; where the government, Telekom, the three global
coordinators and the regional bookrunners met for the last time &#173; took 12
hours the following day.

<P> That was when many syndicate banks finally vented their anger at DMG's
gun-jumping. Lucinda Riches, an executive director in equity capital markets at
SBC Warburg, regional bookrunner in the UK tranche, complained at length to the
whole meeting that DMG had done enormous damage to SBC Warburg in its home
market.

<P> <B>Penalty goals</B>

<P> After that outburst the suggestion was floated to a smaller but influential
group that DMG be ordered by Telekom to pay a fine for jumping the gun and
calling itself sole global bookrunner. Schmitz was apoplectic.

<P> At the time DMG's rivals were probably unaware of the penalties already
handed out by Telekom; that might have modified their calls for sanctions against
that global coordinator.

<P> But applying these relatively mild strictures hasn't laid the issue to rest.
Many syndicate banks are still mulling over DMG's apparent immunity, worrying
that it might encourage others to behave in the same way. Schmitz is unmoved.
What matters, in his view, is that the client was pleased and the issue placed
successfully.

<P> Telekom seems unlikely to respond. A penalty would be unprecedented; there is
an influential view that DMG is not in the dock and that the issuer does not have
the right to act as judge and jury by sanctioning a breach of the rules or
handing down penalties.

<P> Nevertheless strong feelings were expressed to <I>Euromoney</I> about a
global coordinator that apparently could not be trusted to keep its own rules.

<P> The rule that performance and conduct counted at allocation time obviously
did not apply to the global coordinators. Other banks resent that.

<P> Rivals naturally interpret DMG's action as part of a desperate quest for
success and earnings following the large-scale recruitment of sales and syndicate
staff around the world.

<P> The only sanction seems to be publicity. Bankers say that DMG's reputation
will be coloured by views of its professional conduct in this deal. Some houses
say that next time they will try to insist on fixed penalties for any syndicate
bank, including any global coordinator, that breaks the rules.

<P> But no sanctions are possible to restrain an issuer that goes too far in
having its own way.

<P> For the syndicate teams, the IPO appears to have been completed successfully.
After a week of trading, the price had settled comfortably above Dm30.

<P> The issue was a landmark for German finance: the first truly global equity
offering from a German issuer. Telekom stock was marketed by dozens of banks to
3,700 institutional investors worldwide. More than 60 roadshows and presentations
were held in 30 cities. (Ironically, given the earlier debate about the
distribution of the shares, German investors did gain more than a two-thirds
share of the deal. Germany's 67% allocation, 60% of that for retail investors,
was at the top of the range set before bookbuilding, while the other four
regional tranches ended up with allocations near the bottom of their ranges: 14%
for the Americas, 8% for the UK, 6% for continental Europe and 5% for Asia and
the rest of the world.)

<P> Corporate finance in Germany has moved on a couple of years as a result of
the issue. Although 30 German banks handled bookbuilding for the first time in
the Telekom deal, the technique is now firmly established as standard, just two
years after it was first used in the Lufthansa privatization. The Federal Audit
Office is said to have ordered the use of bookbuilding for all future
privatizations because it offers more transparency to investors. For the first
time, German institutional investors could split their orders among underwriters
without fear of a lower allocation or retribution from the coordinators.

<P> Each of the global coordinators has reason to be satisfied with its
performance. DMG ended up with an allocation of 20% &#173; just 0.75 percentage
points ahead of Dresdner Bank, while Goldman Sachs gained about 6%.

<P> After its success with the Telekom share in the UK market, DMG is planning to
expand its sales capacity there.

<P> <B>Now for the next one</B>

<P> At Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, Hofmann has decided to shift control of
equities and corporate finance business out of Frankfurt and into the hands of
Alan Yarrow, head of equities, and Tim Shacklock, head of corporate finance, at
Kleinwort Benson in London. Telekom insisted that all three global coordinators
manage the Telekom issue from Germany, so it is likely Hofmann had been planning
this move for some time but waited until Telekom was out of the way.

<P> Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, has served notice on all European banks that it is
no longer content to play the junior role in any European equity deal, no matter
how political or how large, having persuaded the issuer that expertise can
compensate for lower placing power.

<P> It is still debatable whether the flotation has created an equity culture in
Germany. But the government clearly plans more privatizations, particularly at
the regional and city level. Lufthansa's second tranche is expected in 1997. But
no large German flotation is expected until Deutsche Telekom brings its second
tranche of shares to market, probably in 1999.

<P> Bankers are not yet daring to make optimistic pronouncements about that deal,
but Sommer has beaten them to it. Even these cynical professionals were shocked
to hear he is already suggesting a range of Dm40-Dm50 a share for the second
tranche.

<H3><B> GLASS-STEAGALL </B></H3>


<H2> <B>Chipping at the firewalls</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>US banks still go through
contortions to get round the crumbling Glass-Steagall Act, which limits their
securities business. But action by the US Federal Reserve will reduce some of the
balance-sheet gymnastics required. It will bring one dramatic step nearer the day
when banks and securities firms might merge. Michelle Celarier reports</B> </H4>

<P> Several years ago, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) decided to
expand into the US securities business to meet the needs of its Canadian clients,
and to grow internationally. But becoming a big player in US government
securities wasn't the first thing on its mind.

<P> Nonetheless, the bank hired an 18-member team of government securities
traders from SG Warburg, received authorization to be a primary dealer in US
government debt and started running huge matched books of repos and reverse
repos. Although hardly a profitable business, running such a matched book is a
game that many commercial banks play in the US. Absurd as it may seem, it has
allowed them to participate in securities business, prohibited by the
Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.

<P> The matched books exist to help the banks pass the "90-10 test", to comply
with the Federal Reserve Board's ruling that banks' securities subsidiaries may
earn no more than 10% of their gross revenues from securities underwriting that
the banks themselves are not allowed to do. The revenues from the repo books
count towards the 90% target for eligible revenues to set against the 10% the
subsidiaries can earn from such "ineligible" activities as underwriting
commercial paper, municipal revenue bonds, corporate debt and equity.

<P> The banks' first push into securities came in 1980, when Bankers Trust
persuaded the Fed to let it underwrite commercial paper. But a giant step towards
the demise of Glass-Steagall was taken in 1987 when JP Morgan discovered a
loophole in the act's Section 20, which states that banks cannot be affiliated
with a business "principally engaged" in the kinds of securities underwriting
that the banks are excluded from. The debate turned to the definition of
"principally engaged". The Fed agreed that banks could set up securities
subsidiaries as long as such ineligible activities contributed only 5% of the
subsidiary's gross revenues. Later that figure was doubled to 10%. Since the
banks had long been permitted to deal in government and municipal securities,
many quickly moved these operations out into the subsidiaries. The gross interest
income earned from those operations was considered eligible revenue. Today there
are 30 of these "Section 20" subsidiaries in existence.

<P> As the ineligible activities grew, so did the need for eligible ones. "If you
had $250 million in ineligible revenues, you would need to find $2.25 billion in
eligible revenues. And that is no small feat," says Michael Rulle, managing
director and head of the US region for CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Corp, the
bank's capital markets affiliate. The simplest way is through matched books of
government securities repos and reverses.

<P> Soon the game will be over, as the Fed is expected to raise the proportion of
permitted ineligible revenues to 25%. No institution could be happier than CIBC.
"Banks have been screaming for relief," says Rulle. "The rules have been limiting
our ability to compete." Rulle says the Fed, which is liberalizing the rules in a
way that will virtually dismantle Glass-Steagall, has finally realized it's "just
dumb" to force banks to engage in such activities as building up huge government
books just to meet a legal technicality.

<P> Through a matched repo book, with interest rates at 5%, Rulle estimates, to
earn $2.25 billion in eligible revenues, one would have to find a matched book of
close to $50 billion. "And there's not many $50 billion matched books out there."
Under the 25% limit, he estimates, the same $250 million in ineligible revenues
would force the bank only to have a matched book of about $15 billion, which
would theoretically earn $750 million.

<P> Much to the bankers' chagrin, however, Glass-Steagall will remain on the
books. The legislation, passed in reaction to the US banks' role in the
speculative fervour leading to the 1929 stock market crash, has been amazingly
resistant to change. Banks have been fighting it for over two decades, but a
variety of forces have kept the act alive. First it was the banks' own lending
debacles of the 1980s, in Latin America and then in real estate, compounded by
the costly government bail-out of the savings and loans industry, that made
legislators wary. In recent years, the strength of the US insurance lobby, which
wanted to keep the commercial banks off its turf, thwarted financial reform.

<P> Yet Glass-Steagall has clearly become an anachronism in an age of global
finance, where few other countries' banks face such restrictions, and an
increasingly competitive domestic environment in which many traditional bank
products have become less profitable. JP Morgan, for example, has argued in a
position paper that the limitations imposed on the banks essentially instruct
them to be unsuccessful &#173; "a singularly un-American idea". The act has been
whittled away by product innovation, bank lawyers and the Fed's actions.

<P> <B>Dreaming of mergers</B>

<P> At the end of October the Fed also knocked down three of the firewalls
separating the banks' commercial and investment banking operations. From January,
US banks will be able to cross-market bank and securities products, sell
securities to other bank affiliates and streamline their management, instead of
being forced to staff their securities subsidiaries with non-bank employees.

<P> Last month, Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig also announced a new
rule to allow banks to offer more financial products, including securities. This
would affect those US banks not structured in the bank holding companies that
fall under the Fed's jurisdiction. Though Ludwig was short on specifics, there
has been some speculation that he intends to go much further than the Fed,
raising the limit as high as 49%.

<P> Bankers say the changes will free them of most of the hoops they have had to
jump through to compete in the securities business, allow their equities,
high-yield and corporate debt business to grow substantially, and eventually
result in the long dreamed-of bank-broker mergers. "What it might mean is that
banks will no longer be content to just grow the business, but will want to
acquire it," says Donald Layton, vice chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank. Although
many banks, like Chase, have opted for an internal growth strategy "for
integration and culture reasons," he says. "This now puts the alternative back on
the radar screen for us to think about."

<P> For the immediate future, says Layton, Chase will be building up its equities
business substantially. According to senior bankers, the 10% cap has meant that
banks have had to focus on two of the three most attractive "ineligible" areas
&#173; high-yield bonds, investment-grade corporates and equities. For example,
JP Morgan has concentrated on the latter two, Bankers Trust has targeted
high-yield and equity, and Chase has opted for the two debt categories. In the
near future, these banks are likely to be scurrying into whichever area they've
so far ignored.

<P> Although the New York City-based banks have been the leaders in the effort to
get rid of Glass-Steagall, many bankers and analysts argue that regional and
foreign banks could benefit most from the changes. The restrictions on banks and
their subsidiaries sharing directors have prevented some regional banks with
smaller staffs from having Section 20 subsidiaries. Moreover, it is the regionals
and foreign institutions that haven't generated sufficient growth internally that
are widely viewed as most likely to start the acquisition bandwagon rolling. For
example Hugh McColl, chairman of acquisition-minded Charlotte-based NationsBank,
told a recent analysts' meeting that the bank hopes to buy a non-New York
City-based brokerage by 1998. Earlier this year, Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC)
chief executive officer Marcel Ospel said the Swiss bank was also on the prowl in
the US, looking for "smaller-scale acquisitions aimed at filling niches".

<P> The 10% limit has been a problem for virtually all the banks. "It's something
we have to manage," says Rulle. "People are struggling to maintain their 10%
cap," adds Robert Slaymaker, chairman of BA Securities, the securities subsidiary
of Bank of America. "It's an inefficient use of the balance sheet and therefore
of capital." These low-earning assets also diminish the banks' return on assets
and their net interest margins, both of which can depress stock prices. Slaymaker
contends that those in the business longest have the biggest problem as both
their eligible income and their matched books have grown the most.

<P> The Fed tracks the ineligible revenues on an eight-quarter moving average,
based on banks' quarterly reports. But the banks monitor the percentages daily.
"You look at trading profits, and the deal pipeline, because if a couple of big
deals hit, all of a sudden the ratios go way up," says Michael Capetides, CIBC
Wood Gundy's general counsel. The success of the high-yield team CIBC hired last
year forced it to beef up its matched books. "You look at it every day and make a
decision every two weeks or every month to take the matched book to the next
level. It's not an exact science, but it's crucial." Once a bank gets behind, he
notes, "you're in a lot of trouble, and running very large books gets to be
expensive. You not only have to handle your current ineligible revenue totals,
but you're going back and making up for past time."

<P> The problem is compounded by the fact that the ineligible businesses earn
more than the eligible ones, and it is revenues, not assets, that are being
calculated. "If you have $10 worth of government securities on the books earning
5%, and $1 worth of high-yield assets earning 12%, the 90-10 test doesn't work,"
explains Capetides. The Fed's firewalls also prevent the securities subsidiaries
funding their activities through the bank. This is why the matched books are so
popular. Essentially, they are a self-funding mechanism for buying government
securities. Here's how it works. When a bank buys a security, it funds the
purchase by selling the security with an obligation to buy it back the next day
&#173; a repurchase agreement or repo. Then the bank buys the security back (a
reverse repo) and sells it again. Capetides explains that true matched books
start with a bank "reversing them in and sending them right out again".

<P> Capetides estimates that hundreds of billions of dollars in matched books
exist solely to meet the 90-10 test. Wall Street firms have increased their
trading desks to accommodate the banks. But as banks' need for the matched books
grows, their already marginal profitability declines, and can even turn negative.
"At a certain size, it becomes difficult to find counterparties, and it becomes
more expensive," he notes. Probably around the $10 billion range, he estimates,
"you no longer make money on them". At such a point, for every $100 in US
securities a bank repos out, he calculates, it might only get back $98. But net
profit is not important for the purposes of meeting the 90-10 test. The
calculations are based on gross revenues &#173; in this case the interest earned
on the securities that, for accounting purposes, are still owned by the bank.

<P> Banks have also tried to move fee-generating businesses into their Section 20
subsidiaries to meet the 90-10 test, although they are reluctant to divulge what
they've done. "It's a little proprietary," says a senior banker at a major New
York bank. Competitors speculate that Chase, a leader in loan syndications, has
booked that activity, with its substantial fee income, in the Section 20. Other
businesses deemed eligible include project finance, securities brokerage, private
placements and M&amp;A advisory. But some banks have got into trouble with the
Fed. Bankers say the Fed would not allow one institution to put its substantial
mortgage banking activities in the subsidiary. And earlier this year, SBC became
the first bank to be fined by the Fed for going above the limit. Bankers believe
the Fed deemed SBC was including inappropriate businesses in the eligible
category.

<P> While bankers agree that the liberalization of the limit is clearly the most
important of the pending changes, the firewall relaxations will also make life
easier and less costly. Of the three, the one many bankers say will have most
impact is allowing bank employees to market the services of the securities units.

<P> "We rely on our relationship managers, our commercial bankers in the field,
as the primary contact point with our clients," says Sandy Curlett, president of
First Union Capital Corp, the Section 20 subsidiary of First Union, a regional
bank headquartered in Charlotte. "Having had a firewall which prevented those
bankers from actively making clients aware of the capabilities of our
broker-dealer is like being told we can use our hands, but we're not allowed to
move our arms." In practice, Curlett says the restriction involved "extraordinary
amounts of training". A banker had to be taught he could "talk to a client about
the private placement market, but he was only able to say 'We have a
broker-dealer that can do that'. He couldn't say 'Here's what they've done'."

<P> <B>Ending prohibition</B>

<P> Curlett believes this restriction was probably more onerous for a regional
bank like First Union, spread across 13 states and focused on middle-market
companies, than for the New York-based banks, like JP Morgan, which focus on
Fortune 500 companies and long ago turned many of their bankers into investment
bankers in the Section 20 subsidiary. But Rachel Robbins, general counsel for JP
Morgan, says the bank was also hurt by this firewall. "It impeded the natural
flow of business... You had to have different people covering the same client, or
else change the structure and move people out of the bank so they were in the
holding company or some other subsidiary." The latter wasn't an option in its
international offices, she says. "There we often had two people talking to the
same clients. It was clearly not efficient." Moreover, she notes, even in the US
the bankers in the Section 20 subsidiary couldn't make credit decisions, "so we
had to involve more people".

<P> The prohibition against interlocking directors is also being eased. In the
past, directors, officers and employees of a bank could not work in its
securities affiliate, and vice versa. Under the new rule, employees can work in
both organizations and some directors can serve jointly as long as they don't
comprise a majority of either organization's board. A shared chief executive
officer is still prohibited. Some bankers are relieved by this relaxation, saying
they wanted to put more senior people from the bank on the boards of the Section
20s.

<P> Staffing the Section 20s with bank holding company employees, or just moving
individuals out of the bank and into the securities subsidiary, created other
problems. "Given the convergence of products, it often makes sense to make the
trader who trades loans for the banks also trade for the Section 20 subsidiary,"
says Robbins. Morgan will not need to make changes at the top levels of the
subsidiary. But traders in emerging market loans will be able to trade emerging
market securities and be officers in both units.

<P> But the benefits of this relaxation, according to Bank of America's
Slaymaker, will be constrained by legal factors. "A bank employee cannot pitch
some securities business without being registered by the National Association of
Securities Dealers, and you cannot be registered by the NASD as an employee of
the bank. The advantage of being able to cross-pollinate the two is limited by
securities law."

<P> One banker said the main problem for his institution has been that all bank
holding company employees were also employed by the bank. "When we set up the
Section 20 subsidiary, the board had to be non-employees of the bank. We didn't
have anyone like that." And, although in theory the subsidiary was operated
separately, "in reality functional controls exist. Policies are levied down from
the holding company level, but it made for very impractical working relationships
between the subsidiary and the bank."

<P> "The interlock firewall," adds First Union's Curlett, "has been a problem in
the sense that we've got managerial talent who know the institution well who
really couldn't manage in the bank and in the 20 at the same time."

<P> The third firewall change will let banks purchase a wider range of securities
from their Section 20 affiliates for investment or to accommodate clients.
Bankers concur this is the least important of the changes. But banks with
significant asset management operations will no longer have to place trades
externally, keeping commissions in-house and helping to preserve confidentiality
on some trades. First Union, whose recent purchase of Keystone Investments made
it the third largest US bank manager of mutual funds, believes this change will
be of most use in expanding its retail business. Now most of its Section 20's
distribution is institutional. "And anything that can be done to broaden the
distribution" will be helpful, says Curlett.

<P> In the past, even customers who wanted to do something as simple as buy a
mortgage-backed security could not get their bank to buy it from the Section 20.
"Even though we were making markets in that, they'd have to buy it from somebody
else," adds Bill Maxwell, chairman of NationsBank's Section 20 subsidiary. A
NationsBank employee would have to call an independent broker, who would then
call the Section 20 desk. "It made no sense at all."

<P> But the greatest impact of the impending changes will be the bank-broker
mergers that most analysts, bankers and M&amp;A specialists feel are inevitable,
if not imminent. "For every 90 pounds of gossip, there's an ounce of reality,"
cautions Chase's Layton. Although it might have been possible for big US banks to
buy boutiques prior to the limit change, no one really knew for sure. Now, he
says, "you're more credible if you're talking to someone. They can see running
room."

<P> A 25% limit will make boutiques fairly easy to swallow. That immediately puts
the hot technology firms, such as Hambrecht &amp; Quist, Robertson Stephens,
Cowen and Montgomery Securities, on the alert. Analysts and bankers also reckon
that even some of the largest securities firms could be purchased, at least
technically. "Now bigger banks have the opportunity to buy bigger firms. It
ratchets up the whole thing," says CIBC's Rulle.

<P> Since neither securities firms nor banks publicly break down their revenues
into eligible and ineligible categories, there's still some guesstimation
involved. But most brokerages have huge eligible revenues from asset management,
government securities trading and M&amp;A.

<P> Independent brokerage analyst Perrin Long notes that interest income is a
vast majority of many investment banks' revenues. At Morgan Stanley, for example,
64% of revenues is interest income. Of the rest investment banking may total 25%.
"Then you take out M&amp;A and merchant banking revenues that they have, one
can't help but to think that all your major firms could be acquired, even Merrill
Lynch," he says.

<P> To make a hypothetical case for acquisition, bank analyst Raphael Soifer, of
Brown Brothers Harriman, takes a more conservative approach. He assumes that 40%
of a securities firm's gross revenues derive from ineligible activities. "If the
firm's gross revenues are, say, $10 billion on total assets of $100 billion, a
bank acquirer would have to supply an additional $6 billion in bank eligible
revenues (plus the $6 billion in such revenues which the firm already has) to
create $16 billion in gross revenues to meet the 25% test." Under the 25% rule,
the acquirer would need $100 billion in matched-book assets, which he claims is
"not out of the question". Under the 10% limitation, matched-book assets would
have to total more than $500 billion.

<P> Even with the limit, he argues that the largest securities firms still pose a
"significant challenge" to the banks. Merrill Lynch's annualized gross revenues
for the first half of 1996 were $24.4 billion. However, at Morgan Stanley they
were only $13.4 billion, $13.7 billion at Lehman Brothers, $9.6 billion for
Salomon Brothers and a mere $5.5 billion at Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette (DLJ).

<P> <B>European dimension</B>

<P> Some small firms with little eligible revenues might prove even more
difficult. Analyst Long points to Alex Brown, which has been eyed by many bank
suitors in the past and might be a good target for a regional bank because its
focus on initiation public offerings (IPOs) dovetails neatly into a retail
strategy. Alex Brown has very little government securities business, and a huge
corporate bond trading and underwriting operation. Moreover, since it is an IPO
house, its stock is already priced at about twice book value, leaving little room
for a deal in today's market.

<P> Soifer believes that German, Swiss and Dutch banks, which can live with a 10%
return on their investment, are in the best position to buy a top player. US and
UK banks, whose stockholders require closer to a 17% return, would find it much
more difficult. "A continental European bank could afford to pay two times book
if the target firm has a return on equity of 20%." Today, he says, Lehman
Brothers is trading at 0.9 times book, but only earns around 10%, while DLJ is
earning a little over 20% and trading around 1.5 times book value. And, although
small, DLJ is a top firm in equity, merchant banking and high-yield securities.
DLJ is the best buy, he argues, for an institution that wants to make significant
inroads as a global investment bank. "DLJ is the most attractive candidate.
You're getting a number four firm for less than a market capitalization of $2
billion." The caveat is that the bank would have to factor in the cost of
employee guarantees, which might leave little for investors.

<P> DLJ, previously owned by the Equitable Companies, has been on the block
before, with both US and foreign banks looking at it. Through its 60% interest in
Equitable, French insurance company Axa tried but failed to sell DLJ. Instead,
notes Soifer, it sold a portion of the shares to employees in an IPO. But Axa
still owns 80% of DLJ. Moreover, employees may be more interested in selling now
that they are stockholders. (DLJ did not return calls for comment.)

<P> But there is still a big hitch to a bank purchase of DLJ &#173; and many
other investment banks &#173; that has nothing to do with Glass-Steagall. Banks
organized in a holding company structure are prohibited by the Bank Holding
Company Act from owning more than a 5% stake in industrial companies. Any buyer
of DLJ would have to divest or vastly restructure its substantial, and very
profitable, merchant banking holdings. Such institutions as Bankers Trust and JP
Morgan already structure their merchant banking portfolios with convertible or
other non-voting securities to comply with the law.

<P> Banks most often mentioned as potential buyers include such continental
Europeans as SBC, Dresdner Bank and ABN Amro - institutions with global ambitions
whose US presence trails Deutsche Bank and Union Bank of Switzerland (though
neither of the latter two are ruled out). Another candidate is Bayerische
Vereinsbank, whose attempt to buy Oppenheimer was scuttled by Glass-Steagall late
last year.

<P> Of the big US banks, Soifer thinks Bank of America and Chase are the most
likely acquirors. Reportedly, Chase has considered Salomon, DLJ, Merrill and
Lehman. Bank of America is said to have looked at both DLJ and Robertson
Stephens, but declined to comment. Citibank is considered less likely, since its
unhappy purchase of Vickers da Costa has left a bad taste. JP Morgan is viewed as
culturally opposed to buying, although chairman Sandy Warner has told analysts
that, just because it hasn't bought anything "doesn't mean we're not looking".
Bankers Trust, which could use a brokerage acquisition to boost its business and
reputation, is probably too small to buy a big firm. Regional banks with
acquisitive tastes, apart from NationsBank and First Union, include PNC, Norwest
and Banc One. But they would be more likely to buy smaller, regional
retail-oriented brokers like AG Edwards in St Louis or Raymond James in Florida.

<P> Numerous obstacles remain. The first, and most often stated, is that bankers
seem reluctant to buy the highly cyclical stocks at the heights they appear to be
near in today's bull market. Moreover, argues Soifer, a successful deal would
have to be friendly to keep employees and clients from bolting. And none of the
brokers is much interested in selling, given their current health, say bankers.
"We're in a point in the cycle," says NationsBank's Maxwell, "where investment
houses are doing very well, which makes it a difficult time to acquire someone. I
think people will be very patient." NationsBank's McColl told analysts that even
though he wanted to buy a non-New York-based brokerage, "no one is for sale".

<P> Banks might be best advised to wait for a market turn. "If we saw the Dow
Jones Industrial Average at 4,000 ... that would create a good buying
opportunity," speculates Soifer. That would be more than a 33% drop in the Dow,
similar to the crashes of 1987 and 1974. The caveat to his scenario is an
"irrational buyer who comes in and says I don't care what the price is," says
Soifer. "Once a big deal happens, and a big firm gets bought, that sets in motion
a dynamic of scarcity value."

<P> This is the argument used by M&amp;A specialists to try to convince bankers
to be first, which is fraught with its own complexities. Primarily, bankers worry
about what would happen in Washington if a big bank-broker merger was proposed.
Such a purchase may be technically possible under the new rules, but
Glass-Steagall does still exist. "It's an issue for bank CEOs to be the first out
of the box," says a senior executive whose bank has looked at several brokers.
"Most [of them] realize that if a significant bank attempted to buy a significant
securities house, the deal might end up in the political domain in Washington."
The headaches would only be starting.

<P> What would get the feeding frenzy under way? He says that for a big US bank,
a regional bank buying a regional broker would not cause a stir. "A foreign bank
with nothing in the US buying Lehman... maybe." It would certainly make banks
think if JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley were to merge, he speculates.

<P> The conventional wisdom has been that building investment banking business is
easier than buying it. "That view has been borne out by looking at some
historical examples of acquisitions. They have an uneven track record of
success," says CIBC's Rulle. But he's not betting on that view persisting. "These
things sometimes go in cycles, and I would not take past behaviour as a necessary
predication of future behaviour." Already the Europeans have been challenging
that view by buying British merchant banks. "The only reason it hasn't happened
here is Glass-Steagall." CIBC's position on the subject no doubt mirrors what
other bankers are thinking: "We haven't made a decision one way or the other,"
says Rulle. "But we haven't ruled anything out.

<H3><B> NATWEST MARKETS </B></H3>


<H2> <B>Messy divorce in Hong Kong</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>When one of Hong Kong's
biggest conglomerates and NatWest Markets got together in 1994 they spoke of a
partnership for the long haul. But just a year after Wheelock NatWest wrote its
first trading ticket the joint venture has been dissolved amid vague excuses of
regulatory difficulties. Just another case of NatWest screwing up in Asia? Or was
Wheelock NatWest sacrificed as part of a new strategy in London? Steven Irvine
reports</B> </H4> 

<P> It probably won't be long before the name Wheelock NatWest
is forgotten. Many outside Hong Kong will not even know it existed. A brokerage,
with a corporate finance arm and a fund manager attached; capitalized at $125
million, with 250 staff, and seven offices across Asia; it did virtually nothing
in two and a half years.

<P> It has only one major point of interest. Former employees say it was as good
as destroyed by one of its own shareholders, NatWest. It provides a good example
of the pitfalls of joint ventures, especially in a difficult region like Asia.

<P> A joint statement in November by the two partners, NatWest Markets and
Wheelock, a Hong Kong property conglomerate, said that the joint venture was
wound up because of "a number of changes in the industry, and in the overall
regulatory environment".

<P> However, it is clear that regulatory barriers were not the real problem.

<P> "We entered the joint venture with a long-term view in mind," says John
Howland-Jackson, chairman of NatWest Markets Asia. "And Wheelock fulfilled all
their obligations and contributed whatever they could. But things changed in the
world of NatWest Markets."

<P> What changed?

<P> "NatWest Markets has changed and is a successful organization today," says
its chairman, Martin Owen. "People actually queue outside our door now. The very
best in the world want to work for us."

<P> In May 1994 when it signed up with Wheelock this was not the case. In Asia
the firm's reputation was terrible. County NatWest, the bank's previous
incarnation, had lost money in the early 1990s both in Japan and Hong Kong. Both
operations were shut down &#173; as was Singapore. In Hong Kong there were
recriminations at the sudden loss of 60 jobs. It didn't look as if anyone would
take NatWest seriously if it ever came back.

<P> But with Asian equity markets booming in 1993, NatWest Markets decided to
renew its presence in the world's highest growth region.

<P> In the early part of 1994 the Berwick Group, a consultancy firm, was given
the task of getting NatWest back into Asia.

<P> Nicholas Sibley, the recently appointed head of Wheelock's financial
division, Wheelock Capital, and an old Hong Kong hand, was sounded out over lunch
by an old friend at Berwick. The former head of Jardine Fleming and BZW Asia
wasn't instantly keen but struck up a good rapport with Simon Meredith-Hardy, his
opposite number at NatWest Markets. The joint venture was announced in May 1994.

<P> The choice of Wheelock wasn't as random as it at first might seem. Peter Woo
Kwong-ching, the head of the Wheelock conglomerate, and one of three remaining
candidates for the post of chief executive of Hong Kong after the handover to
China, likewise had a special connection with NatWest &#173; he was a founding
member of its international advisory board.

<P> The rationale was simple. Wheelock, the 149-year-old property-to-retail
conglomerate with an annual turnover of $13 billion, is one of the most important
Hong Kong Chinese companies. It would give the venture credibility, persuade
clients NatWest Markets was not about to repeat its disappearing act of the early
1990s and lend its name to the recruitment process.

<P> Sibley was to be Wheelock's day-to-day point man &#173; the experienced pair
of shoulders who could swing almost anything over a lunch and go the extra mile
over dinner. Howland-Jackson, Owen's deputy, was to liaise between London and
Hong Kong.

<P> <B>Premature congratulation</B>

<P> Those who were cynical about whether the agreement between them would come to
anything watched as the summer passed and a chief executive failed to be
appointed. A full five months later, David Miller came from US bank State Street
to take on the post. He and Nick Sibley knew each other from Jardine Fleming,
where Sibley had made him head of Tokyo.

<P> "We have positioned ourselves as a major house in the restructuring of
corporate China," Miller told <I>Euromoney</I>'s special Asian issue in February
1995.

<P> China was the theme. Meocre Li, Arthur Andersen's former managing partner in
China, became the firm's corporate finance head. His accountancy background gave
him good access to Chinese companies. It looked a clever hire.

<P> The staff count grew quickly. There were 90 employees in October 1995, and by
the time the joint venture was dissolved in October 1996, there were 250.

<P> Two to three months before the end, an inner circle of Hong Kong gossips
sensed it was coming. But the public face of Wheelock NatWest was buoyant to the
end. As recently as July, Miller commented: "My job is to build an innovative and
powerful force in Asian investment banking, and there is a three- to five-year
building phase." Wheelock chief executive, John Hung, said the company was in it
"for the long haul".

<P> And so, it seemed, was NatWest Markets. It had achieved its aim of getting
back into Asia. And even snatched a brief moment of glory, with the $135 million
IPO spin-off of Concord Land &#173; its first major lead managership. But
ironically the deal's launch came almost simulataneously with the announcement
that the joint venture was to end in divorce. The joint venture &#173; created in
nine weeks by Sibley and Meredith-Hardy &#173; fell apart almost as quickly.

<P> "It was moving very rapidly in a direction of not just research and broking
but becoming very capital-intensive and particularly risk-intensive," says Owen.
"Frankly we never do risk-intensive businesses outside of our own structure for
control issues &#173; irrespective of who our joint venture partner is."

<P> Wheelock had been led to believe otherwise. As far as it was concerned,
NatWest's $250 billion balance sheet had always been part of the Wheelock NatWest
equation. The $125 million of paid-up capital was regarded as a token amount to
be leveraged off the bigger prize in London. But it gradually emerged that the UK
partner's balance sheet would be selectively available.

<P> Early on the omens were bad. A team of traders was hired in July 1995 in
accordance with the business plan. Ross Reason, former head of equity derivatives
and trading at SG Warburg, brought two colleagues and expected to sit down and
start to make some money. Miller commented at the time: "Our senior management
takes every opportunity to employ the best people in the business." But what use
are the best people in the business if they can't work?

<P> NatWest Market's management's approved the appointments. But a turf war soon
erupted in London. The risk management people were concerned about loaning out
the NatWest balance sheet for Reason's derivatives activities. Reason and his
team were given a bureaucratic barrage of excuses and, to their horror, no
computer systems. This despite the joint venture agreement which specified that
the UK bank would provide all the systems and audits Wheelock NatWest would
require.

<P> With no systems Reason couldn't trade. Exasperated, the Wheelock NatWest
management intervened personally with Martin Owen.

<P> Owen recalls there were faults on both sides and does not deny that he was
forced to "review pockets of potential politics". Although there was undeniably a
period of six months in which the traders lacked computer systems, part of the
problem, he says, was that Reason's team were poor articulators of what they
wanted to do. They lacked familiarity with NatWest's internal processes for
obtaining trading limits, and also lacked a knowledge of the sort of robust
systems they required.

<P> Should it not have been NatWest's systems people who figured out such
technical details? "This takes time," says Owen. "And it took six months for them
to articulate what they wanted to do. They wanted to do reasonably exotic things
and these systems had to be tailored." Owen adds that the scale of the trading
Reason's team envisaged was beyond anything that was in the business plan.

<P> Wheelock NatWest completely missed out on a bull market in the warrants
business in the last quarter of 1995 and the opening quarter of 1996. Owen
authorized a couple of deals personally, but the warrants business cannot be
easily transacted through a chief executive in another time zone.

<P> In the end, specific individuals were given "limited" authority to trade. But
Reason left in early 1996.

<P> "The issue we have struggled with post-Barings," says Owen, "is how do you
demonstrate clearly in an autonomous arms-length business how risk is controlled
where its principal controls are through board meetings once a month." Wheelock
NatWest, he says, was not even an acceptable counterparty in the derivatives
market. All of its trades had to be done back-to-back with NatWest Financial
Products.

<P> It was clear from this early stage that the joint venture wasn't working out
quite as both parties envisaged. In NatWest's Markets' Broadgate headquarters,
other acquisitions focused the minds of Owen and his senior management. Among
these were M&amp;A boutique Gleacher in 1995, and US bond house Greenwich and UK
corporate advisory Hambro Magan in 1996.

<P> But NatWest's decision to buy fund manager Gartmore proved more than just a
diversion.

<P> Wheelock NatWest had its own fund management business. By the time of its
demise, Wheelock NatWest Investment Management had been managing $600 million,
the bulk of which came from the partners (including Wheelock's pension fund) and
$200 million from Japan.

<P> <B>A fund manager too far</B>

<P> The poaching of Nigel Wightman in June 1995 was controversial. The Asia
Pacific chief executive of Rothschild Asset Management brought eight fund
managers with him, leaving Rothschild in tatters. His brief was to build the
Asian business on behalf of Wheelock NatWest and NatWest Markets &#173; whose
Asian investment management team had just transferred across to the joint
venture.

<P> Wightman had been told that NatWest might acquire a domestic fund manager in
the UK, but this would only "add value" to the existing business. He was led to
think that NatWest Markets was committed to growing its on-the-ground Asian fund
management business.

<P> All but two of his ex-Rothschild team were already in the firm's NatWest
Tower office in Hong Kong's Causeway Bay. The final pair had less than a week
left on their gardening leave when news broke in February that NatWest was buying
Gartmore, the London-based global fund manager. It didn't take them long to
realize they had no job to go back to.

<P> NatWest executives in Asia were surprised by the Gartmore acquisition. Martin
Owen and Gartmore's chief executive, Paul Myners, handled the negotiations
personally. Owen says the deal was concluded in less than 10 days. Secrecy did
not permit word of the ongoing negotiations to be passed on to the joint venture
since both were public companies, and stock exchange negotiations forbade it.
However, Owen does say the Hong Kong joint venture was told 24 hours before the
announcement was made public.

<P> What immediately alarmed Wheelock was that NatWest had bought a fund manager
that had an extensive Asian business of its own. Gartmore had a Japan fund (with
&#163;73 million under management), a Pacific growth fund (&#163;127 million),
and a dedicated Hong Kong fund (&#163;23 million). With the exception of Japan,
all of Gartmore's funds are managed from London.

<P> Myners had worked with the joint venture's Wightman at Rothschild in the
early 1980s. So Wightman had no illusions about the future. Myners' style is
independent, as is Gartmore's. Gartmore is an organization that has a philosophy
of keeping all of its staff in London, and managing the funds in a distinct
Gartmore style. Myners had told his buyer that the business would be left alone.
(This was confirmed by Owen's November reorganization. It was announced that
Gartmore would have a separate operating committee and that Myners would report
directly to Owen.)

<P> Wheelock NatWest chief executive Miller and fund management head Wightman
went to London. They asked whether Gartmore's Asian funds would be farmed out to
the joint venture. Myners looked over to Owen. He said no.

<P> "Gartmore's philosophy is that all fund management remains in London," Owen
told <I>Euromoney</I>, "If you pack funds off to Wheelock NatWest that is a
different philosophy." These philosophies, he says, are conflicting.

<P> But there wasn't room for two NatWest-linked fund management businesses in
Asia: Gartmore and Wheelock NatWest. It would confuse clients, as Owen puts it,
to have "two centres of fund management excellence competing for business in the
region". One would have to go, and since NatWest had just paid &#163;472 million
for Gartmore it was quite obvious which.

<P> Wheelock was bemused. Did it have any say in the closing of its own business?
The joint venture agreement was inspected. It was a document of 30 or so pages,
strong on procedure &#173; how often board meetings will be held and the like
&#173; but vague on details regarding mutual commitments.

<P> Sibley, the deputy chairman of Wheelock NatWest, had been involved in drawing
up the agreement. But his view had been that if you had to resort to reading the
agreement, the joint venture was over anyway &#173; in spirit if nothing else.

<P> <B>What's yours isn't mine</B>

<P> The two shareholders had set out with the assumption that anything in Asia
was the joint venture's. On the specific subject of fund management this included
Asia-targeted funds generated from institutions in London.

<P> However, the joint venture agreement was flawed. One of NatWest's
London-based index-funds was Japan-targeted, and therefore NatWest couldn't sign
any agreement that guaranteed all Asia-linked funds out of London would go to the
new joint venture. Its index fund business was too profitable. Both sides,
however, had already agreed during internal meetings to give Wheelock NatWest
Investment Management a broad mandate that in practice comprised London. This all
smacked of formality and since neither partner wanted to stall the process, the
written agreement therefore mentioned <I>only </I>the joint venture's exclusive
right to manage funds collected in Asia itself.

<P> NatWest took legal advice on this point, and lawyers said it did not
contravene the letter of the joint venture agreement.

<P> Immediately following the Gartmore acquisition, Wheelock boss Peter Woo
pressed his case. He wrote a polite letter to NatWest chairman Lord Alexander
stating his concerns about the unsuitability of the Gartmore acquisition in
respect to their Asian fund management business. He received a reply from
Alexander stating he would look into it. Nothing happened, so a second letter was
sent.

<P> Woo eventually ordered a meeting. In April he arrived in London with Sibley
to meet Alexander and NatWest chief executive Derek Wanless. He explained the
position, and requested the fund management issue be resolved to his
satisfaction. Both Woo and Sibley departed for Hong Kong with the impression it
would be.

<P> It was not.

<P> Instead NatWest hired financial M&amp;A boutique Phoenix and tried to find a
buyer for Wheelock NatWest Investment Management. But after limited interest in
the US this came to nothing. The fund management business was quietly closed in
October, and the Rothschild team, so expensively hired, was paid off and fired.

<P> "I'm sad we've disrupted their lives," says Howland-Jackson. "It is not good
practice."

<P> "I became puzzled that Gartmore became so emotive an issue," says Owen. "But
I was sitting in a different place. My mind was in Europe." Such
misunderstandings appear to have permeated the joint venture throughout. By the
summer their pace accelerated.

<P> The five executive directors of Wheelock NatWest were still waiting for
NatWest Markets to sign off on the long-term incentive scheme, which was to
comprise a substantial part of their pay. Wheelock had agreed to this back in
December 1995.

<P> All five, which included John Williamson, NatWest's former head of custody,
talked of resigning, but concluded it would be a betrayal of the staff they had
hired.

<P> Matters ought to have improved with the relocation of Howland-Jackson, Owen's
deputy, to Asia. Howland-Jackson had been the venture's staunchest ally in
London.

<P> But his arrival in August coincided with news that NatWest Markets had hired
Steve Yamane from Morgan Stanley &#173; a trader whose epitaph could be "The man
who finally broke Wheelock NatWest". Yet again NatWest Markets had failed to
inform the joint venture of its new hire, who would head Asian equity trading and
derivatives.

<P> It was another <I>fait accompli</I>. NatWest Markets had unilaterally decided
to take Asian trading out of the joint venture's sphere of influence and put it
in NatWest Markets. The press release made no mention of Wheelock NatWest. It was
as if it didn't exist. Wheelock NatWest would not be viable if trading was pulled
out.

<P> What lay behind this change of strategy was the arrival in June of Tom
Whelan. A former Morgan Stanley head of equity derivatives, he was hired by Owen
to take charge of global equities. His hires in Tokyo reflected his intention to
generate revenues from proprietary trading in Japan.

<P> The joint venture agreement never prohibited NatWest Markets from trading in
Asia. But NatWest Markets could only trade with other marketmakers. The joint
venture agreement didn't allow NatWest Markets to go near client business.
Wheelock sources suggest NatWest wanted the client flows, to run its proprietary
trading more effectively.

<P> Yamane's Tokyo operation therefore violated the joint venture agreement.

<P> Owen came to Hong Kong and met with Peter Woo. It was not a pleasant meeting.
According to accounts circulating in Hong Kong, Woo was not prepared to watch
NatWest treat him in the same fashion as it had done over Gartmore. Apparently he
banged his fist on the table at one point. He also used what has since been
called the <BR> D-word in reference to NatWest's treatment of the joint venture.
The D-word is believed to be "despicable". Woo was clearly annoyed by this
diversion from his campaign to become the Hong Kong government's chief executive
in July 1997.

<P> He pointed out that the joint venture agreement had been violated and
threatened legal action. It was clearly the end of the relationship. All that was
left was to figure out how much it would cost to buy out Wheelock's 50% share.

<P> The figure will appear as an exceptional item in Wheelock's end-of-year
accounts, and it is hinted that it is substantially more than if the conglomerate
had just banked its capital. The public announcement of the break-up had to be
delayed till the payment could be voted at a full NatWest board meeting. A heated
discussion is said to have taken place over the figure.

<P> Ironically, the Hong Kong press reacted to the news on November 5 by savaging
Wheelock. Conglomerates analysts in Hong Kong accused the company of yet another
failed joint venture to add to the tie-up with Richard Branson's Virgin group,
which was signed in February 1994 but hasn't left the drawing board.

<P> They pointed to the hype. Wheelock had claimed the joint venture would help
finance projects all over China thanks to NatWest's financial expertise and
Wheelock's contacts. What projects? What contacts? Had any materialized? Analysts
noted that Wheelock had also said it would turn Wuhan into the "Chicago of
China". Four years later plans for a container terminal, a commuter rail system
and a power plant have come to nothing.

<P> Woo made himself available to host functions, or to take part in meetings at
the Chinese Central Bank. But his political ambitions prevented him travelling
round China with the corporate financiers &#173; which would have been difficult
even without the political ambitions. The Wheelock name, it is true, did not
bring too many deals, although it is rumoured in the market that its Philippines
connections have helped it (whatever <I>it</I> will be, when NatWest settles on a
name for the revamped Asian business) to win a lead role in the public offer for
Philippines Nickel.

<P> <B>Hope over experience</B>

<P> Sibley's attempt to build a Jardine Fleming of the 1990s before he finally
leaves Hong Kong's shores in February 1997 to retire, received censure, even from
friends. "You never step in the same river twice," one said. Unlike Jardine
Matheson, the conglomerate which tied up with Robert Fleming (two Scottish
houses), Wheelock was not engaged in much corporate business of its own. When
Jardine Fleming was formed it was immediately thrown into the fee-paying hostile
takeover of Dairy Farm by Hongkong Land (a Jardine company). Such transactions
provided the backbone for Jardine Fleming's expansion across Asia.

<P> Where does the failed joint venture leave NatWest Markets in Hong Kong? Owen
is bullish: "Asia is more relevant to us than it was five years ago. We
understand it better, we understand the risks of the region better and we have
much better people working for us."

<P> However, Owen has made clear that product centralization will be instituted
for the sake of greater efficiency. Reporting lines will go into London.
Integration will occur. Some already have. One rival syndicate head laughs that
he has been invited on a junk-boat trip to meet NatWest Market's London head of
syndicate.

<P> What has NatWest bought? The 250 staff are of varying quality. Among those
considered top-notch are the likes of Philip Mok, formerly BZW's top-rated head
of Hong Kong research, who brought a whole team with him, and is known to be good
at training new recruits. But with only about $95 million of capital consumed
(the venture had $30 million left of the $125 million it had drawn down) the
process of building has proved dramatically less costly than the $3
million-a-head price tag for Gleacher.

<P> What of NatWest's reputation? "This place is a village," says one Hong Kong
financier. "Overall NatWest probably did the right thing. But everyone who does
business with them now sends negative signals to Wheelock. I'd say this has set
them back five years in Hong Kong and China."

<P> The business focus, however, has changed. China is no longer the clarion
call. "Japan is our single biggest priority in the region," says Howland-Jackson.
"That is not to decry the importance to us of China, India or South East Asia."

<H3><B> THAILAND </B></H3>


<H2> <B>Why the Big Mango stayed on the tree</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>1996 was not a
good year for Thailand. Economic problems piled up as thick as Bangkok's
legendary traffic and the pundits forecast a Mexico-style accident. But the Big
Mango, as Thailand's capital city is known, did not go splat</B> <B>&#173; thanks
to skilful technocrats who steered the country to safety. It's early days but the
worst could be over, reports Gill Baker</B> </H4> 

<P> Outside South America, the
country most haunted by the ghost of the Mexican crash is Thailand. All the signs
of success coming apart at the seams are there, including a large current account
deficit, a build up of short-term debt, an overvalued currency, a moribund stock
market, overextended banks, a property slump and inept government.

<P> As if this wasn't enough, journalists, analysts and academics have been busy
penning articles pointing out the dangers Thailand faces. Financial meetings in
London and New York have been abuzz with Thailand horror stories and many bankers
with Thailand risk have flown to Bangkok to assess the situation.

<P> If Thailand was indeed on the brink of collapse, such scaremongering should
have sent it over the edge. But the country has held firm and, while the problems
are by no means resolved, the country's technocrats are starting to breathe a
little easier.

<P> Thailand's civil service is noted for its cool steering of the economy during
periodic crises such as military coups, political upheavals and riots. Such
domestic difficulties are commonplace for an experienced Thai technocrat. But
there was less confidence about whether they could prevent substantial capital
flight out of liberalizing financial markets. This was the challenge that
defeated Mexico.

<P> So far Thailand has fared much better and analysts are now starting to
attribute the country's economic problems to structural adjustment &#173; the
malaise affecting all the Asian tigers &#173; rather than a new-style emerging
markets rout. One analyst has even accused Moody's &#173; which raised tension in
September by downgrading the country's short-term debt  &#173; of getting hold of
the wrong information.

<P> "There's no way [Thailand's short-term debt] is over 40 [billion US
dollars]," says Mark Greenwood, managing director of Asia Equity Thailand. "The
book-keeping has been wrong and that was not properly explained to Moody's
because they were talking to the wrong people at the BOT [Bank of Thailand]."

<P> This, says Greenwood, was because the central bank was preoccupied with the
troubled Bangkok Bank of Commerce (see <I>Euromoney</I> October 1996, page 62) at
the time of Moody's research, and the banking supervision and statistical
department were not communicating with each other properly.

<P> If this were true (Moody's says it stands by its decision), it reflects
rather poorly on BOT technocrats, whose reputation did indeed suffer during the
Bangkok Bank of Commerce (BBC) debacle, when the BOT's independence was
questioned and its former governor, Vijit Supinit, came in for criticism. A more
generous assessment of the Thai crisis is that BOT executives, notwithstanding
the BBC affair, have handled an unstable situation with customary aplomb.

<P> Through a series of small but emphatic measures, the BOT has been acting over
a long period to slow capital inflows (so cutting down the scale of any
subsequent outflows), to cool overheating and credit growth, and to push Thailand
very gradually towards a free-floating baht. (The contradiction between a fixed
exchange rate and the need to run an independent monetary policy is at the root
of Thailand's difficulties.) Such policies have provoked the disdain of the
financial community which sees them as a reversal of Thailand's liberalization
efforts. But given Thailand's success in avoiding a shock devaluation that might
have triggered a crash, this seems a small price to pay.

<P> <B>On the edge</B>

<P> At times things have looked very delicate and the economic situation remains
serious. After a run of spectacular economic growth over the past decade,
Thailand has become a victim of its own success. Inflation, at around 5.7% a
year, is barely under control; export growth has weakened; and in August the
current account deficit was around Bt30 billion ($1.18 billion). Despite the
insistence of senior Thai bureaucrats that the problem is merely a blip, others
are not so convinced.

<P> "The consensus is too optimistic in hoping everything will return to normal
after just one year. Many of the problems are structural and will take three to
five years of adjustment," says a report from Kleinwort Benson, which believes
the stock market has yet to hit bottom and is warning investors to steer clear or
be saddled with "dead money" for a year.

<P> The stock market has been falling for most of the year, hitting a low of 905
in October. Expectations that the poorly regarded government of Banharn
Silpa-arch would be replaced by a Democrat-led coalition following last month's
elections sent the index up to just over 1,000, only for it to fall back after
the New Aspiration Party came in ahead.

<P> "It's a real mess," says Robert McMillen, managing director of investment
banking at  General Finance &amp; Securities. "They will probably announce a
reasonably acceptable [government] finance team, then Banharn is going to stick
his nose in and I am not sure it will materialize."

<P> Throughout the crisis the currency has been the main focus of attention. The
baht is pegged to a basket of currencies whose composition is a closely guarded
secret; but Morgan Stanley calculates it to be 88% US dollars, 8% yen and 4%
Deutschmarks. The dollar/baht mid-rate is announced daily by the Bank of
Thailand, which pledges to buy or sell unlimited amounts within a band Bt0.02
either side of the mid rate.

<P> Sporadic rumours of a baht devaluation have kept foreign investors in a state
of nervousness since the Mexico crisis, but so far the Bank of Thailand has stood
firm in its intention to support the currency, pouring millions of dollars into
the repurchase and offshore swap markets in July and August.

<P> A potential trigger for a devaluation would be an outflow of funds. Merrill
Lynch estimates there is around $24 billion of "hot" money in portfolio inflows
and non-resident deposits which could be sold and would bring down the baht. But
the investment bank points out that Thailand had international reserves of just
under $40 billion, as at the end of July, which is a substantial buffer. In
addition, Thailand's reserves are sufficient to cover around 30 months of current
account deficits, against just six months' cover in pre-crash Mexico.

<P> But whether the reserves are sufficient in relation to Thailand's short-term
debt is a topic of debate. Moody's downgrading of Thailand's sovereign debt from
Prime-1 to Prime-2 was based on a short-term debt figure of $41 billion. A
Moody's report said: "The downgrade reflects the country's increased
vulnerability to a financial shock through the balance of payments as a result of
the very rapid and recent accumulation of short-term external debt." The rating
agency also points out that "the spill-over effects of any financial instability
may also have negative implications for Thailand's long-term foreign currency
debt ratings".

<P> Asia Equity's Greenwood believes the situation is not as serious as Moody's
claims. He argues that while nominally the figures show $41 billion of short-term
debt, the booking of part of the debt figure by BOT was inaccurate and is being
re-examined. Some $9 billion of the short-term debt figure, Greenwood says, comes
from Bangkok International Banking Facilities (BIBF) loans arranged by foreign
branches of Thai banks. (BIBFs are offshore banking operations which enable
institutions to borrow non-baht currencies overseas and lend either domestically
or offshore.) This is effectively long-term debt since it is being raised as
long-term money offshore but lent back into Thailand as short-term money.

<P> A further $9 billion, says Greenwood, comes from foreign bank lending, mainly
by Japanese BIBFs, which involves borrowing short-term and relending long-term to
Japanese companies in Thailand, replacing much of the equity which used to be
booked as foreign direct investment. Greenwood puts genuine short-term debt at
nearer $23 billion than $41 billion &#173; $30 billion at the outside.

<P> The BIBF is the centrepiece of Thailand's attempts to liberalize financial
markets, and management of the resulting flows has challenged the BOT. Some of
its measures to rein in the economy have not earned much praise. Most recent
among these have been restrictions on lending by BIBFs. The minimum loan size has
been increased from $2 million to $5 million, and total domestic BIBF lending by
local institutions has been capped at 7% of baht loans, with the aim of stemming
short-term foreign capital inflows. Foreign BIBFs are required to match
one-for-one their domestic and offshore loan extensions. The result of these
measures will be increased interest rates as demand for credit intensifies, thus
restoring confidence in the baht but tightening liquidity &#173; at least that is
the theory. But conventional wisdom has a way of being turned on its head in
Thailand.

<P> "It is hard to contemplate the future without more shocks," says the
Kleinwort Benson report. The build-up of short-term debt, predominantly through
BIBFs, has been a chief cause of concern, increasing exposure to changes in
international sentiment. Total foreign debt was around $83 billion at the end of
1995, of which $16.4 billion was public and $66.2 billion was private, including
$23.7 billion from BIBFs.

<P> Thailand's current problems have been worsened by financial liberalization at
a time of economic slowdown. Many of the domestic institutions are just not lean
enough, or lack the necessary expertise, to compete in a freer market. There is
also a fundamental change affecting Thailand and many of its Asian neighbours as
companies shift from cheap-labour manufacture of such goods as textiles and
footwear to businesses harnessing technology, management and skilled staff. Jan
Cherim, general manager at ING Barings in Bangkok, believes Thailand is facing an
extended period of readjustment. "The thing that astonished me is the way in
which expectations have been so bizarre about the Thai market," he says. "In the
first part of the year export growth dropped to single digits and everyone
panicked as if the sky was falling in. People forget what it means. It just means
exports are growing at a slightly slower rate. I'm not at all pessimistic about
growth. It is about time they shifted gears, and not at all unhealthy &#173; you
cannot defy gravity with these ridiculous figures for ever."

<P> "The current economic downturn apparently caught forecasters off guard," says
Tara Siam Business Information in its latest quarterly economic review. Managing
director Chesada Loha-unchit says: "All the major economic indicators clearly
point to a downturn in the Thai economy and there is a chance that unless
something is done quickly, it may be headed for a hard landing." The company
forecasts growth at 7.2% for this year and next, with 6.2% inflation for the full
1996 year. "It is quite clear that Thailand can no longer be complacent in taking
external factors such as international capital flows and major world currency
alignments for granted," says Chesada. "The experience of the last few years has
clearly shown that traditional economic policy tools, although not completely
ineffective, cannot be used in the same way in an economy which has become much
more open. The high interest rate policy in an environment of controlled foreign
exchange risk is the most glaring contradiction."

<P> <B>The derivatives question</B>

<P> One consolation is that shocks will not be magnified through derivatives.
Thai banks and companies are still not using derivatives to any large extent, and
the foreign banks are tending to lend offshore in US dollars, with proceeds
swapped into baht, with most borrowers tending to have dollar revenue, says
Goldman Sachs regional banking analyst Wanna Matanachai. However, some of the
dollar borrowing is not fully hedged. "If the BOT starts to widen the currency
band it could have some repercussions," says Wanna. A number of Singapore banks
are exposed to straight Thai lending, but Japanese banks account for a huge slice
of BIBF lending and are the most vulnerable.

<P> Thai convertible bonds were heavily traded by foreigners offshore in the week
before the election. A number have put options close to maturity that look
certain to be exercised. One Thai company which appears to have prepared for the
problem is listed Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction, which raised an $80
million loan recently to cover the early redemption later this year of its $80
million 10-year convertible, which was lead-managed by Jardine Fleming and Swiss
Bank Corporation in 1993. The loan was arranged by the Singapore branch of HSBC
Investment Bank.

<P> Companies that may not be so fortunate include troubled Somprasong Land and
Bangkok Land, which have another two or three years' breathing space on their
puts. Although property companies are likely to be hardest hit, those in volatile
sectors such as electronics could also be struggling. A notable exception is
Alphatec, which has already made provisions to fund redemption of its bond due
1999, which is puttable next June at 111.25%.

<P> "Maybe one or two have adopted the ostrich management style, and there will
be fireworks," says Cherim of ING Barings. On the other hand, most convertible
issuers are high-profile companies and if it seems they might have to default,
they will go running to their main local relationship banks for help. "They will
mortgage their first-born in exchange for being bailed out," says Cherim. It is
unlikely they will be able to refinance in the public markets, he says. "Price
targets are a million miles off. It would be a very brave investor who did not
exercise the put," he adds.

<P> The authorities have been tinkering with financial rules and regulations for
the last year and a half. Some policies have been announced and then rescinded or
modified while others have never got past the ideas stage. The latest is an
announcement by the central bank that as part of its new open market policy no
limits will be imposed on lending growth next year. Lending growth was restricted
to 21% this year, compared with 24.5% last year. Finance ministry permanent
secretary Chatumongol Sonakul was quoted as saying the move was the first step
towards a free-floating baht, but that would not happen until "sufficient
devices" were in place. The central bank is also looking to appoint primary
dealers through which to trade government securities in order to control
liquidity.

<P> Ironically, it was the Mexican peso crisis which contributed to the brevity
of the latest cycle in Thailand. The crisis increased emerging markets' capital
costs and focused attention on capital accounts. Since the beginning of 1995,
measures to stem capital inflows to Thailand have included an increase from 2% to
7% in the reserve requirement for non-resident short-term baht bank deposits, and
a similar reserve requirement for finance companies; exclusion of "non-priority"
foreign currency loans in calculations of banks' net foreign exchange positions;
and a rise in the minimum capital adequacy requirement from 8% to 8.5% for
commercial banks, and from 7% to 7.5% for finance companies.

<P> <B>In the clear</B>

<P> These policies seem to be working with BIBF out-in loans &#173; money
borrowed offshore and on-lent domestically &#173; dropping by about 1% to $30.7
billion. Average monthly net inflows into non-resident baht deposits fell from
$1.3 billion in the first quarter of the year to $150 million in the second
quarter.

<P> A research paper by Thai broker Phatra Thanakit calls for a relaxation in
exchange controls over the long term. "Given the irreversible trends of
globalization and financial liberalization, it is necessary for the local
financial system to withstand dramatic and frequent changes. The pressure is
likely to increase when inflows are short-term in nature because of the risk of
quick reversal," says the paper. "The current exchange rate regime in which the
value of the baht is pegged to the basket of currencies makes it increasingly
difficult for the Bank of Thailand to effectively control domestic liquidity and
money growth. In other words, it is not possible to simultaneously maintain the
exchange rate and interest rate stability, while foreign capital is fully mobile.
To cope with the highly volatile and mobile capital inflows, it is crucial for
the exchange rate system to shift from the peg system to a more flexible exchange
rate policy."

<P> Even if Thailand has avoided a Mexico-style crash it must still face up to
the poor condition of many of its banks and companies. The stock market has been
adversely affected by poor third-quarter results from major companies along with
continued worries about the health of the banking sector,  exemplified by the BBC
scandal which revealed huge bad and doubtful debts put at around Bt20 billion and
brought charges of embezzlement against senior bank executives.

<P> Most of Thailand's 15 commercial banks are believed to have serious bad debt
problems, exacerbated by the close-knit, often family-oriented, nature of their
operations. This leads to intra-group lending and judgments on creditworthiness
that are at best unsophisticated and at worst highly questionable. The drive to
report ever-increasing profits has meant provisioning has not always been as
stringent as it might be.

<P> The property market has been one of the key reasons for the woes of banks and
finance companies. The bottom has dropped out of a market which only two years
ago looked like a licence to print money. Residential demand has dried up, and
there is an oversupply of office space.

<P> "The financial system is strained by poor-quality loans made during the
upswing of the present cycle in 1994-95," says a Morgan Stanley report. "The
finance companies are in worse shape than the banks because of their larger
exposure to property." Morgan Stanley puts non-performing loans at 4.1% in the
second quarter for finance companies, compared with 3.9% for the whole of 1995.
The ratio for banks was 7.7% in 1995, but the investment bank was unable to come
up with a definitive figure for this year.

<P> The smaller banks, which lack the huge branch networks and capital base of
their bigger counterparts and are under more threat from liberalization, have
fared worst. But in a report entitled "Crisis? What Crisis?", Morgan Stanley
notes: "We believe the Bank of Thailand is capable of managing the problems in
the financial system and avoiding a system-wide crisis. The central bank does not
want banks to fail, and it has the instruments to prevent failures and the
experience to manage the work-out of troubled institutions."

<P> On all fronts, it seems, Thailand's technocrats are managing bad situations
well. But if Thailand is in the clear what is needed now are long-term measures
to take account of  new economic realities. The new finance minister Amnuay
Viravan is a former banker. Will he go down in history as the man who freed the
Thai baht?

<H3> <B>Korea and Taiwan dominate
<I>Euromoney's</I> latest ranking of Asian banks with 21 of the top 50 between
them. Australasia has been included in the list for the first time this year,
with four Australian banks in the top 10. Japan's banks still suffer from the
country's poor economic condition and their performance is improving only slowly,
writes Rebecca Dobson</B> </H3> 

<P> The Republic of Korea dominates
<I>Euromoney</I>'s 1996 table of the top Asian banks with 21 entrants, 11 of
which appear in the top 50. Only Housing &amp; Commercial Bank rises, however, up
28 places to 55, with equity almost doubled at $880 million from $469 million.
Government ownership was reduced to 46.8% following an initial public offering
(IPO) in January, when the bank changed its name from Korea Housing Bank to
reflect its new commercial status.

<P> Among the 20 Korean banks that lost ground, Korea Exchange Bank, at 16, is
the republic's largest commercial bank with shareholders' equity standing at $2.9
billion, ranking second behind Korea Development Bank. A breakdown by total
assets sets Korea Exchange Bank above its peers at $70 billion (up from $55
billion according to last year's figures). Also worth noting are Shinhan Bank,
whose equity is up to $2.3 billion from $1.9 billion after last year's rights
issue, and Kookmin Bank, which brought two share issues to the market in 1995,
reducing the government's stake to 23.94% and raising the bank's equity from $1
billion to $1.5 billion.

<P> Taiwan is also distinguished with 10 banks in the top 50. However,
deregulation and the creation of 16 new banks since 1990 have increased
competitive pressure and produced a drop in net income and a rise in funding
costs. The economy is slowing, especially in the domestic market with GDP growth
now around 6%, and all banks have fallen in the ranking except Taiwan Cooperative
Bank, which remains at 39. Significant changes include the Bank of Taiwan, which
drops to 13 from seven with a 7.64% fall in profits; Chang Hwa Commercial Bank,
down to 37 from 30 &#173; its fall in profits is 16.07%; Chung Shing Bank,
slipping 24 places to 88, reveals its shareholders' equity to be down by $12
million to $542 million.

<P> <I>Euromoney</I> has responded to readers' suggestions and extended this
year's Asian 100 to cover Australasia bringing seven banks from that region into
the chart. Four banks appear in the top 10 &#173; National Australia Bank,
Westpac Banking Corp, Australia &amp; New Zealand Bank and Commonwealth Bank of
Australia &#173; ousting Bangkok Bank, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp and Bank of
Taiwan.

<P> Overall, there are 17 new entrants into this year's ranking. In all, only 13
banks move up the list, 64 fall, and six remain in last year's position. Three
Philippine banks make it into the ranking this year: at 47, Metropolitan Bank
&amp; Trust Co's recent aggressive strategy has paid off with shareholders'
equity up to $912 million from $601 million following its rights issue in August
1995 &#173; the fourth since 1993. Philippine National Bank drops to 73; its
equity fell from $816 million to $640 million due to the sharp decrease in asset
reclassification reserves. Philippine Commercial &amp; Industrial Bank enters the
top 100 at 76.

<P> Of the six Malaysian banks to feature in the ranking this year, only Bank
Bumiputra moves up &#173; just two places to 50. Malayan Banking and Public Bank
slipped by eight and nine places respectively to 25 and 45 after a quiet year in
the domestic equity market. Indonesian banks have dropped too: Bank Rakyat
Indonesia falls by 10, Bank Negara Indonesia by 18, Bank Dagang Negara by 18 and
Bank Ekspor Impor Indonesia by 19.

<P> Japan's top 50 banks are much the same as last year. The decline in the yen,
bankruptcies, weak credit growth and a struggling consumer sector are hindering
the economy and bank performance is sluggish. Newly-merged Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi tops the rankings by shareholders' equity and by total assets
and boasts the second highest net profit at $414 million after Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank.

<P> Profits elsewhere are significantly lower as bad loans and falling property
prices persist. Some of the highest ranking banks show the steepest losses: Fuji
Bank (minus $3,021 million), Sakura Bank (minus $1,694 million) and Sanwa Bank
(minus $1,157 million). Sumitomo Bank, which recorded losses last year of $3.2
billion, has regained some lost ground and rises to third from fifth place with
net profits of $367 billion.

<H3><B> DERIVATES </B></H3>


<H2> <B>Swinging around the world</B> </H2> 

<H4> 

<B>The pace of development of
new derivative products may have slowed since the heady days of the early 1990s,
not least because users are more aware of what they are buying and what it ought
to cost. But new instruments are still catching on and specific geographical
markets are adapting to special local needs. Andy Webb reports</B> </H4> 

<P>
Derivatives markets are constantly on the move. Credit products currently feature
most prominently in the considerations of derivatives providers and sophisticated
users, though there are plenty of other developments contending for attention.
These include asset packaging, access products, volatility derivatives, the
declining role of exotic products, and the hedging of corporate share-incentive
schemes.

<P> Geographically, Europe and the US remain highly active markets for
derivatives and Asia is also important, though oversupply may be developing
there. Australia is beginning to attract attention, not least because of the
special derivative needs of an electricity market in the course of being
deregulated.

<P> <B>Product developments</B>

<P> <I>Credit derivatives</I> Most banks now regard credit derivatives as a
separate asset class in their own right. From a banking viewpoint they are
probably as significant a development as the emergence of the swaps market a
decade ago. In the last 12 months the market has reached critical mass; it's no
longer just a case of matching up one-off transactions. Serious potential clients
have sorted out their internal policies, legal issues and documentation and so
are ready to deal.

<P> There are also encouraging signs on the administrative and regulatory front,
with International Swaps and Derivatives Association documentation developed and
clear capital guidelines having emerged from the US Federal Reserve and the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. In the UK the Bank of England is
expected to produce similar directives soon.

<P> For many banks perched on the fence, these developments could be enough to
propel them into the market. Shaun Rai, director and head of global credit
derivatives at CIBC Wood Gundy, reckons volumes could be enormous. "If you
broadly define the credit markets to include bonds and loans as well as the
credit risk incurred in normal corporate business activities, you're arguably
looking at the largest class of risk in the world," he says. "Until the last year
or so, there were no effective tools for managing that risk. The potential scope
for the market is huge. Despite the globalization of financial markets, most
credit risk is still held on a regional or national basis: the bulk of US credit
risk is still held in the US, for example. Already European institutions are
starting to use credit derivatives to take on US investment-grade credit risk. As
an alternative to opening an office in the US and trying to enter the loan market
directly it's obviously very attractive."

<P> Admittedly the state of the markets in recent months has been especially
favourable to credit derivative development: global interest rates are at
historically low levels. "There are a number of business drivers that are very
obvious right now," says Blythe Masters, global head of credit derivatives at JP
Morgan. "One is the fact that the prices of financial assets are at exceptionally
high levels; combining that with heady stock markets, tight corporate credit
spreads, possible interest rate hikes and a potential turn in the default cycle
gives people a strong incentive to get involved in credit derivatives."

<P> Those observers expecting institutions that have got involved to get their
fingers burnt may well be disappointed if Masters' experience of the developing
market is anything to go by. "Most of the business we have seen to date has been
in credit default and total-return swaps, which are not complex instruments," he
says. "In a credit swap, the risk-taker receives a stream of basis points and has
the potential liability of making a substantial cash payment in the event of a
default. That's a risk profile that banking institutions are by definition
comfortable with. At the same time, standards of due diligence and disclosure are
also high."

<P> Apart from general interbank and corporate activity, Masters sees two
specific areas in which credit derivatives could play a significant role. "One is
the extent to which credit derivatives become used in the syndication process and
become a tool of the trade. The other is the way in which they could be used to
arbitrage pricing discrepancies in the credit market. Currently a corporate
credit will have different prices attached, for example, to a loan and an
in-the-money interest rate swap. There is no reason why different prices for the
same risk should prevail, once you have created an instrument that allows those
discrepancies to be exploited."

<P> <I>Asset packaging and structured notes</I> With interest rates remaining
low, asset packaging has continued to be a growth business globally. The simpler
forms of packaging activity may not offer colossal margins, but they do provide a
reliable income stream. Mark Blundell, treasurer at Rabobank in London, has
noticed the trend. "One thing that has happened over the last year or so has been
that everybody has piled into the asset-packaging business. We're an enormous
investor in asset packages and like a lot of other people we're trading them now
as well. As a result the spreads over Libor for these names have shrunk, so that
the difference between lesser-rated credits and higher-rated credits has
definitely narrowed. It's the only business that I know in the dealing room that
makes money every day, I can set my watch by it. It may not be enormous but it
will always be a positive number."

<P> <B>   </B>In the current interest rate environment a lot of the repackaging
business is being driven by existing holders throwing debt issues back into the
market in search of better credit or yield. In areas like Japan, where fixed-rate
sellers tend to be in the majority, there have been opportunities for derivative
houses to pick these up cheap to be used in swaps. After repackaging and
warehousing them for a while, they can be resold to floating-rate investors
looking for loan-replacement products.

<P> Peter Colvin, regional head of marketing and investor products at ABN Amro in
Singapore, has seen a lot of this activity. "Repackaging illiquid second-hand
debt from the Japanese marketplace such as samurais, dual-currency bonds, reverse
dual-currency bonds and forex-linked notes has been a high-volume business. The
dual-currency products also create higher swap activity by increasing the flow
into yen, US dollar and Australian dollar swap books."

<P> Structured notes have also been making something of a comeback. "It's been a
predictable consequence of investors hunting for yield in a low interest rate
environment," says Andrew Firth, vice-president of interest rate derivatives for
Banque Nationale de Paris in London. "The difference has been that this time
around people are staying clear of highly leveraged structures. Volumes are
certainly not as high as they were three years ago, but there has been an
increasing number of enquiries for lightly structured products, such as callable
notes and reverse floaters."

<P> <I>Access trades</I> With international investors trawling the emerging
markets in search of opportunities, liquidity and market impact have become major
concerns. So access and allocation trades have proved fruitful business for
equity derivative desks. "Asia has obviously been a particularly fertile region
for access trades, it's now a steady flow of business that should continue," says
Andrzej Rojek, senior managing director of global equity products at Bankers
Trust. "As barriers come down, interest will start to shift into asset allocation
products."

<P> In some eastern European markets the problems of direct equity investment go
beyond simple liquidity issues. In countries such as Poland and the Czech
Republic it is estimated that more than 80% of equity trades go OTC rather than
through exchanges. At the same time stock substitutes have become increasingly
popular with managers that are administering rapidly growing portfolios or have
relatively few staff.

<P> Eric Slighton, head of global relative value at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's
Hong Kong office, has seen two further variations on this theme. "In some
regions, market-access derivatives have been as much in demand from local
investors as from offshore funds. We have also been tailoring products for
particular segments of some markets, as well as the whole of the more difficult
to reach ones."

<P> <I>Volatility derivatives</I> Volatility derivatives have been around for a
while as a concept and there are at last signs that they are ready to hit the
market. The potential demand is there &#173; one investor (believed to be a hedge
fund) recently made a huge pure volatility play on the UK's FT-SE 100 index by
buying and selling 70,000 option contracts on Liffe.

<P> Although volatility derivatives may never attain the volumes that can be
expected of credit derivatives, the clearest sign that they have arrived is the
listing of volatility futures on London derivatives exchange OMLX. Three
contracts will be available: on British, German and Swedish equity indices.
"Given the way that equity markets have been trending, most derivative houses
have a huge amount of out-of-the money exposure which is causing concern; these
are an excellent tool for handling that exposure," says Simon Ruddick of Albourne
Partners. "Another application is that while many houses find it comparatively
easy to sell long-term options expensively, it's incredibly inefficient to hedge
those with short-term options. The volatility future is a far more elegant
solution."

<P> <I>The decline of exotics and the rise of the informed user</I> Another
current trend in the derivatives markets is the general decline in "exotics for
exotics' sake" activities. The original logic behind the development of
increasingly complex structures by derivative houses was the hope of individual
houses that they would be the only firm able to price them accurately and would
thus benefit from relatively wide spreads. Mark Byrne, international head of
arbitrage and fixed income at CSFB in Tokyo, considers that those days are gone.
"The Chinese restaurant menu of exotics has been written, the emphasis now is on
consistent quality of pricing to customers. The cycle on pricing new products has
compressed from maybe six months to more like four hours." <B> </B>

<P> For some banks the swing away from the more convoluted exotics is related to
the growth of knowledge among clients. Many of them now have the skills and
technology to understand and price products themselves.

<P> Mark Preston, head of trading for financial products at CIBC Wood Gundy, has
seen this reflected in the level of activity at the firm's school of financial
products. "Clients now want to understand the scenarios that cross their desks.
They may still expect you to be able to provide structured solutions, but they
expect to pay wholesale, not retail, prices." Michael Bresges, CIBC's head of
structured marketing, agrees. "The regulatory benefit of all this is undeniable.
You are showing the regulator that you're doing everything to push the client up
the learning curve."

<P> <B>Geographical trends</B>

<P> <I>US</I> In the US, credit derivatives are still the dominant theme, but
firm-wide risk management has come a close second. A common theme is that both
credit derivatives and value at risk (VAR) have such a wide application, from
corporates to financial institutions. Chase Manhattan has been introducing
clients to new risk techniques offered under its Charisma suite of risk
analytics. "The application can be phenomenally varied," says Fred Chapey,
Chase's global derivatives executive. "For a bank the VAR horizon could be 24
hours with a singular focus on a trading portfolio's market-value risk, for a
corporate it could be a year or more and focus on pension-funding risk, and a lot
more in between. Many regional and international banks are now interested in the
different risk methodologies that exist and how to apply them to their businesses
and incorporate them into their systems and infrastructures. Nevertheless there's
still a considerable amount of confusion over VAR; people still sometimes call
you up and ask: 'Can I have the disk?' The proper question should be: 'These are
my goals and objectives, what approach and tools should I use to manage the risk
in my business?'"

<P> Other firms have seen an increase in risk management activity on the back of
Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure requirements. "It's an issue that's
currently taking up a great deal of US corporates' time," says Leslie Grant,
global head of risk management advisers at SBC Warburg. "An issue that has
emerged from that has been that of client connectivity via the internet/intranet
for valuation and risk management purposes. US corporate derivative activity is
stalling because of the uncertainty surrounding SEC disclosure requirements. Such
activity as there is has been due to currency hedging now that the dollar seems
to have bottomed out."

<P> <I>Europe </I>European banks are understandably concerned with Emu. Apart
from the obvious issue of redeployment, there is also considerably activity in
helping clients to prepare for the changes. The political considerations that
determine how hard or soft the euro will be have induced fund managers to make a
considerable number of relative value trades. Of the FX derivatives being dealt,
a high proportion are still barriers, though there has been growing activity in
basket trades.

<P> The Swiss franc and sterling, cast in the role of safe havens, have figured
heavily, though Vincent Lauwick, head of marketing and sales at Soci&eacute;te
G&eacute;n&eacute;rale in Paris, has seen a lot of French franc/Deutschmark
business. "End users have mainly focused on yield curve strategies and products
including two or more currencies which would be in or out of the euro, such as
diff [differential] swaps. The bulk of deals have concentrated on the convergence
between French franc and Deutschmark."

<P> Some feel that the assumption that there will be a single European yield
curve post-Emu is wide of the mark. "It's a common misconception", says CIBC's
Preston. "Some of the recent decisions regarding convergence criteria mean that
there will be many yield curves within the euro, in terms of sovereign trading.
Countries within Europe will borrow at different levels. There may be one
Libor/Interbank curve but it will still be possible to trade multiple sovereign
curves. We are heavily involved in trading credits and still expect to have an
active book after Emu."

<P> Equity derivatives have been making significant advances. This has been
partly driven by insurance and pension legislation, such that downside
fluctuations in investment portfolio values are less tolerable, so that there is
now a clear need to hedge equity exposure. With UK institutions in particular
being generally long equities, derivative activity has been further enhanced.
Stephen Smith, head of equity derivative products at SBC Warburg, has also seen
two particular areas of corporate activity in equity derivatives. "Firstly,
changes in enterprise valuation practice have meant that companies are now only
valued on core assets; cross shareholdings often do not fall into this category.
Using derivative solutions to unwind these positions while minimizing market
impact has been popular. Secondly, the hedging of companies' employee share
incentive schemes, in order to reduce balance sheet risk, has also been a major
source of business."

<P> <I>Japan</I> With substantial deregulation likely in Japan next year, the
market is preparing for major changes. Although the unleveraged structured-note
business has been recovering, some of the activity has arisen because of
legislation that prevents Japanese investors buying exotic options onshore unless
they are embedded in a structure. If this regulation is removed, a lot of
business will move into OTC and exchange-traded options.

<P> Selling premium (particularly on puts) is at historically high levels. This
is also vulnerable to regulatory changes since shorting premium currently enjoys
attractive accounting treatment. Low interest rates have prompted an expansion of
dual-currency issues, mostly Australian dollars, but also US dollars, New Zealand
dollars and even sterling. The appetite has been enormous (even Mrs Watanabe is
buying), with a knock-on effect on swaps business, as well as fixed-income and
foreign exchange derivatives.

<P> When it comes to exchange-traded products, Japan is looking increasingly
vulnerable to the Singapore Internatonal Monetary Exchange. The cost disparity is
enormous: high fixed commissions and exchange fees in Japan mean that a contract
on Simex can be traded for as little as 20% of the cost in Tokyo. Large
international players are already starting to vote with their feet; CSFB has
already bought a seat on Simex and is planning to build a floor team there.

<P> <I>Asia ex-Japan</I> As in Japan, asset swaps and repackaging have blossomed
in the rest of Asia on the back of low interest rates. With Japanese banks having
forced down the price of syndicated loans to an uncompetitive level, Asian
regional banks that would traditionally look to this area for corporate credit
exposure are going elsewhere. They are finding what they need in swapped or
repackaged debt. As most of the names on paper being issued in Japan at present
are AA or AAA, buyers are getting better quality as well.

<P> A similar tightness is prevailing in traditionally higher-yield lending to
joint venture and industrial Asian companies. In order to enhance yield in these
circumstances, the regional banks are looking in the Eurodollar markets for even
unrated names repackaged into Libor spreads of 100 plus. They can then do a
straightforward dollar interest rate swap into 190-200 over Libor in the two-year
to four-year bracket.

<P> For the largest banks, asset swapping convertible bonds from Asian corporates
is a major activity. It is system- and credit-intensive, and is thus restricted
to a handful of players. Those involved in the market need the facilities to
handle the equity risk, either to warehouse it or broker it off to another party
that wants that component. Its exclusiveness means that it tends to get
overlooked, but it is lucrative both for investors and the repackagers.

<P> <I>Australia</I> Deregulation of the electricity-generating and distribution
industry worldwide is an area of enormous potential growth for derivatives that
is attracting a lot of attention. This has been especially keen in the Australian
market, where the process is already well advanced. At present most of the
derivative transactions are between distributors and generators. The Sydney
Futures Exchange is aiming to provide a facilitation service for generators and
distributors by January 1997, but it will not be guaranteed by the clearing
house. Russel Armstrong, the global head of derivatives at Westpac, is upbeat.
"The next stage will be distributors and major customers hedging spot risk, which
is likely to take off when all major customers become contestable next year.
After that, the next step will be the development of a longer-term swap market."
The whole east coast of Australia will effectively be one market with homogenous
contracts, which will probably mean that the product will have a short life cycle
before it becomes commoditized.

<P> With a significant amount of Australian government debt having been issued in
inflation-linked instruments, the outlook for inflation-indexed derivatives is
also good. Many key infrastructure products involve consumer price index bond
issues with maturities of between 27 and 30 years. Although many fund managers
like the term of the asset, they are not keen on the consumer price index risk.

<P> Several banks, including Westpac, have been active in swapping these into
floating rate to provide managers with a long-term asset that gives a margin over
bills.

<H3><B> EUROPEAN IPOs </B></H3>


<H2> <B>When it's time to leave home</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>Family businesses often
fight shy of the exposure required by a stock exchange listing. Yet if family
firms need fresh capital for growth or to meet the competition, a public offering
needn't spell the end of family control. James Featherstone looks at the state of
European private-company flotation and the investment strategies of 13
family-controlled businesses. </B> </H4> 

<P> Only a tiny proportion of the
hundreds of thousands of family-owned companies in Europe are listed on
exchanges. But increasingly, second- and third-generation family members are
seeking to raise capital and realize some of their assets. An initial public
offering (IPO) is not a straightforward decision for management. A wider choice
of exchanges, a greater emphasis on equity investment in continental Europe and
generally buoyant capital markets have increased the profile of flotations as a
way of raising capital. But such considerations as loss of total control, the
greater disclosure required of a company when publicly quoted and the effects of
share-price volatility on corporate fortunes can make managers think twice about
an IPO.

<P> Although public listings are an increasingly attractive option, there is
evidence to suggest that family-owned businesses are more hesitant than other
private companies about undertaking them. A recent survey of the corporate
finance requirements of Dutch companies undertaken for the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange by market research company The Netherlands Institute of Public Opinion
and Market Research (Nipo) found that although 32% of companies polled said it
was "highly likely" they would go for a public listing within three years,
family-owned companies were consistently less enthusiastic. The more stringent
disclosure requirements involved was the main reason cited. Private companies
with a wider spread of share ownership are generally larger than family
businesses, so the extra financial openness involved in a public listing is more
acceptable and familiar to them. Many family companies do not have much or indeed
any experience of disclosing information to third parties.

<P> In addition, the price sensitivity of quoted stock and the larger number of
shareholders can cause owners to worry about loss of control. Italian packaging
company EMA, which listed on the Milan stock exchange last year, is a case in
point. EMA's share price initially doubled before falling back to the issue price
on the back of bad annual results and a strong lira, which hit the company's
export earnings. Italian companies that depend heavily on exports, such as the
fashion houses featured here, have more reason to be concerned about a domestic
listing than a suitable foreign one, since an appropriate foreign listing can
insulate them from currency fluctuations. Choosing the right exchange is one of
the most important decisions for a family company (see box).

<P> Domestic political events affect family companies' listing decisions. In
Italy, for example, the tax breaks that did so much to direct the attention of
Italian entrepreneurs to the stock exchange look unlikely to be renewed in the
1997 budget, which it is expected will conform to the deficit requirements for
European monetary union. Companies doing IPOs in Italy were given a 16% rebate on
corporation tax for the three years after a listing. A Milan-based Italian
companies analyst said: "Italian family entrepreneurs don't care that much about
listing. If this tax window closes, there will not be a great incentive for them
to go public." Alternative markets may still prove attractive, but local
conditions can affect companies' perceptions of the effectiveness of publicly
quoted equity.

<P> <B>Catching up slowly</B>

<P> An increased readiness on the part of investment managers Europe-wide to
increase the proportion of equities in their holdings is stimulating stock
markets and making listing a more attractive prospect for family companies. But
continental Europe is still far behind the UK and the US. In Belgium on average
businesses trade for 90 years before listing; in the UK it's 17 years. Of the
top-10 investment managers in Europe ranked by total pension fund assets under
management, nine are UK-based. These funds have holdings of $724 billlion, 81% of
which is invested in equities. French mutual funds, by contrast, which are second
only to the US in their total holdings, are only 15% invested in equities. The
German figures are even more striking &#173; only 9% of pension fund holdings are
in equities. Attitudes to equity in Germany are strongly affected by the banks'
approach to corporate finance which still tends to stress partnership and loans
rather than listed equity.

<P> Change is in the air. Dutch pension funds are set to increase their equity
weighting by anything up to 30%. Even the cautious Danish institutional funds,
which are prohibited from holding more than 20% of their portfolios in equities,
are giving them greater consideration. Governments and financial institutions
&#173; including French mutuals &#173; are beginning to realize that equities
might provide the added value bonds, cash and money market instruments cannot
muster. French fund management companies are having to cope with short-term
interest rates that have halved recently, hence the appeal of equities.

<P> This change in equity culture is running parallel with many family companies
going public as part of the natural development of their businesses. A number of
academic studies have shown that the third generation in a family concern is most
likely to sell part or all of its holdings, so companies founded in the first
half of this century are now poised to consider doing this.

<P> Family businesses then, more than non-family owned concerns, will have to
weigh the greater access to investment funds, the release of capital and the
higher company profile against the greater disclosure requirements and the
greater risk of equity capital markets.

<P> <B>Italy</B>

<P> Italy and Germany have the largest proportion of family-owned businesses in
Europe so there is great potential for IPOs. A number of Italian fashion houses
were tipped by analysts as likely candidates. The almost miraculous success of
the Gucci flotation on the New York Stock Exchange last year has drawn attention
to similar companies still in family hands. Before listing, Gucci had to contend
with a highly damaging family war and a series of bad business decisions that led
the Italian government to appoint a chairman to try to stabilize the company. But
the flotation was a great success. The issue was heavily oversubscribed and
within the first week of trading Gucci's share price increased by 20%. So other
Italian fashion houses are now well placed to take advantage of positive investor
sentiment.

<P> <B>Valentino</B> Rumours of an IPO for Milan-based fashion house Valentino
are growing. Giancarlo Giametti, its co-owner, has stated publicly that the
company is talking to US investment bank Goldman Sachs about a New York Stock
Exchange listing. As with the other Italian fashion houses featured here, a US
presence is important. The proposed listing makes sense &#173; Valentino opened a
new flagship store on New York's Madison Avenue in September. Goldman Sachs was
brought in by the company in 1995 to advise on a programme of restructuring and a
possible flotation. But there are obstacles. Giametti and chief designer
Valentino Garavani want to retain a stake after the listing and it is rumoured
that this halted talks with Goldman Sachs earlier this year. Although the company
does not reveal ownership details, it is well known that Garavani owns around 65%
and Giametti the rest. "The fact that Goldman Sachs has the mandate for
restructuring makes a listing a near certainty," says an Italian broker. "We're
expecting it any day now."

<P> <B>Ducati Motor</B> Italian motorcycle manufacturer Ducati Motor is a good
bet for an IPO in the longer term. The company is a recently formed joint venture
between TPG Partners, a $720 million private investment partnership owned by US
investment fund Texas Pacific Group, and Italian holding company Cagiva, which is
controlled by Claudio and Gianfranco Castiglioni. The deal went through in
September this year, TPG Partners acquiring a 51% stake in Ducati. The remainder
of Ducati Motors is owned by Cagiva, which bought Ducati in 1985. Large
injections of investment or venture capital are a strong indication of an
eventual listing. A spokesman for TPG Partners says a listing by Ducati Motors
was "a very real possibility", but that TPG Partners and Cagiva want to "build a
strong trading company first". Ducati has proved its trading strength by posting
an annual growth rate of 25% for the last five years &#173; sales in 1995 topped
$200 million. Ducati is a niche manufacturer that produces fast, powerful &#173;
often red &#173; bikes. Recent additions to the product line include the popular
Sport Naked, known as Il Mostro to devotees. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell advised TPG
Group and Cagiva on the purchase and a consortium of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell,
Banque Paribas, and Banca Commercial Italiana provided financing.

<P> <B>Prada</B> An analyst for a Milan-based brokerage company used a novel
method for assessing rumours of an IPO from fashion company Prada: "When I was in
New York recently, the crowd in the Prada shop there was very impressive," he
says. "That I find interesting. They should be listed somewhere." This is backed
up by harder evidence. The fashion business is a dynamic sector in Italy and
Prada is up with the leaders. In the last few years it has taken advantage of an
upturn in the luxury goods sector and has posted good growth and sales figures.
Prada recently staged a joint show with UK artist Damien Hirst at the Florence
Biennale featuring a live zoo. No investment bankers were present to sound out
the possibility of a public offering.

<P> <B>Salvatore Ferragamo </B>If Ferruccio Ferragamo, the Milan-based fashion
house's group chief executive officer, chooses not to go public, his five
children and other members of the Ferragamo family will inherit a rapidly
expanding business. Like the other fashion houses featured here, Ferragamo is
exploiting an upturn in the luxury goods market, posting a 34% increase in
turnover last year compared with 1994. In the last two years the company has
widened its geographical coverage by opening new shops in such places as Sydney,
Melbourne, the Australian Gold Coast, Dubai, Beijing and Monte Carlo. But
Ferragamo's own retailers account for only 25% of sales; the balance being
wholesale.

<P> Ferragamo has similarities with Gucci, the formerly troubled fashion company
that was floated so successfully in New York last autumn. Both companies are
family-owned, they produce goods for the same sector and Ferragamo has been
tipped for a flotation for a number of years, as was Gucci. Ferragamo, unlike the
pre-float Gucci, is in a very sound position and the company is not obliged to go
public in order to sort out family and financial problems.

<P> It can also take advantage of the tight control it has over its branded
products and franchises, two areas the Gucci management allowed to slip away in
the years leading up to its IPO. Ferragamo has held to a focus on shoes and other
luxury leather goods, its traditional specialities, avoiding uncontrollable
proliferation of products &#173; a problem Gucci had to address before listing.
If Ferragamo goes public, the choice of stock market may be simple: 45% of sales
are to the US and US investors now have a proven appetite for Italian fashion
houses.

<P> Such a sound business has inevitably attracted the interest of investment
banks. But the company is still entirely in family hands and a spokesman told
<I>Euromoney</I> it has no plans to list. Wanda Ferragamo, the wife of the
founder, is still in charge as president of the group she runs with her six
children, including Ferruccio Ferragamo.

<P> <B>Diesel </B>Renzo Rosso, founder and sole owner of Diesel, has never worn a
suit to work. Corporate finance officials looking for business from the northern
Italian clothing company may want to bear that in mind along with Rosso's
management ethos: "You can't run a business by the book ... I don't much care for
qualifications and titles, the important thing is the person fits into the group.
When you give someone the chance to fly, they very often do."

<P> The company has all the right credentials for going public: dynamic growth, a
high European profile with wholly owned subsidiaries in France, the UK and the
US, and the potential for further expansion. This makes Diesel an attractive
investment prospect. The Italian brokers and banks <I>Euromoney</I> spoke to have
been waiting for Diesel to list in Milan for some time. Marina Tosin, a company
official, said Diesel is preparing for an IPO and is looking to list some time in
1998, probably on the New York Stock Exchange. But Tosin insists that Diesel is
in the very early stages. "We are still studying the project," she says. "The
date is not fixed, it could be postponed." Diesel has yet to approach an
investment bank, either in Italy or the US, to advise on the issue although Tosin
says a US bank would be favourite for lead manager.

<P> <B>Air Europe</B> An Italian carrier based in Gallarate in central Italy, Air
Europe has an ambitious expansion programme. New aircraft and new routes outside
its main domestic market are partly to be financed by a listing on the Milan
stock exchange scheduled for a so-far undecided date next year. It is studying
the possibility of an IPO managed by Sopaf, an Italian investment bank that owns
18.4% of the airline. Management is looking to float 25% of the company, the
minimum requirement for a listing on the Milan stock exchange. However, the
company says it has not made a firm decision to list in Italy. "We are at the
beginning of the process and we don't know where we are going to float," says
Lupo Rattazzi, Air Europe's president and a member of the Rattazzi family which
owns an interest in the company. Decisions such as these will be taken by Sopaf
which, according to an agreement signed when it became a shareholder in Air
Europe, will be lead manager in any listing. According to Rattazzi, 1997 is the
most promising date for a listing because it is a favourable point in the airline
industry cycle. The company expects a slowdown in growth in 1998 and wants to
take advantage of a public offering before then.

<P> <B>Belgium</B>

<P> The Belgian equity market has been sluggish since the mid-1980s, the last
period when there was much activity in new listings, but a number are expected in
the short to medium term. High-profile textiles company Syoen Textiles listed on
the Brussels exchange on September 30 and has performed well so far. Brokerage
companies spoken to by <I>Euromoney</I> expressed confidence in prospects of a
rising stock market.

<P> <B>Interbrew </B>An IPO from Belgian brewing conglomerate Interbrew is high
on the wish list of brokers throughout Europe. But information is sparse.
Interbrew has a reputation for discretion and does not disclose information on
which families own the company, how much they own, what the company owns, or how
large it is. But some facts are known: Interbrew is effectively controlled by the
de Spoelberch and Van Damme families. It is generally assumed that between them
they control most of the stock. A large number of companies are owned and
controlled by Interbrew. Canadian brewer John Labatt, Dutch brewers Orangeboom
and Dommelsch, and Interbrew France are all 100% in Interbrew hands. It also has
controlling interests in two Italian breweries and a number of eastern European
breweries. This year Interbrew has moved into China with the partial acquisition
of the Zhu Jiang and Sichan Blue Sword breweries. In 1994 the company sold its
interests in a number of African breweries.

<P> A spokesman for Interbrew said there were no plans to list on any stock
exchange and never had been and that there was no reason to list. But the high
level of gearing taken on after John Labatt was acquired last year has prompted
speculation about an IPO. "Interbrew is such a big company it's incredible that
it is not public," says the head of research at a Belgian brokerage.

<P> <B>Germany</B>

<P> Germany has over a million family businesses, so the scope for IPOs is large.
But the Neuer Markt, Frankfurt's second exchange, will not open until March 1997.
And although the Frankfurt exchange has been pushing all-time highs recently it
has relatively few new issues and listing requirements are stricter than many
companies would like.

<P> <B>Georg Urban </B>Ulrik Urban is the fifth-generation owner and managing
director of Georg Urban, a conglomerate founded by the Urban family early in the
19th century. The company holds a wide range of subsidiaries with interests in
record production, food manufacturing, car importing and building.

<P> Georg Urban is growing strongly and the need for more capital is the main
reason for its seeking a listing early in 1997 on AIM (the Alternative Investment
Market), the UK's second market. Ulrik Urban ruled out a listing on the Frankfurt
stock exchange because he believes equity investment in Germany is
underdeveloped. Waiting for the Neuer Markt to open was not an option as the
disclosure requirements are more stringent than AIM's. Urban believes the main
methods of raising finance in Germany &#173; partnerships and bank loans &#173;
are too restrictive and rarely include a stock exchange flotation. "An exchange
like AIM is very much needed in Germany," he says. "It will be difficult for any
German company to go to the Neuer Markt but easy to go to AIM." The companies
Urban wants to float would be too small to list on the Frankfurt exchange but are
well suited to AIM, which presently lists 13 foreign companies. Ulrik Urban will
be listing the first German companies on AIM and hopes to open the way for many
more, increasing the profile of public equity as a way of raising capital in
Germany. "In Germany people put their money in a fund, get 5%, and are happy," he
says. "They are just not aware that they can invest in a stock market; even if in
Germany you are still restricted in the companies you can invest in."

<P> <B>Denmark</B>

<P> <B>Tinglev Element</B> <B>Fabrik</B> Expansion plans and a reluctance to
increase borrowing lie behind Tinglev Element Fabrik's decision to list on the
Copenhagen stock exchange in the spring of 1997, says finance director Jorn
M&oslash;ller. The company, based in Tinglev, produces prefabricated concrete
building structures for the German market. Almost 99% of Tinglev Element Fabrik's
business is done in Germany, mainly former West Germany. Managing director Jacob
Cnutsen owns 75% of the shares, the rest being in the hands of Danish investment
fund LD Invest. Cnutsen will not be selling any of his stock in the company.
M&oslash;ller says no decision has been taken on the lead manager for the float,
although Alfred Berg is in talks with the company.

<P> <B>InWear</B> Clothing company InWear has recently announced that it will
seek a listing on the Copenhagen stock exchange in the near future. Managing
director and majority shareholder Nils Martinsen has good reason to look forward
to going public. He owns 92.5% of the Dkr389 million ($66 million) shareholder
equity in the company he founded 27 years ago. Total shareholder equity is 53% of
total assets.

<P> There is no obvious reason why InWear should list now. It has had
considerable success as a Europe-wide clothing retailer and has financed
expansion internally so far. Martinsen says simply: "The time was right for a
listing". Additional financing for further expansion is not, says Martinsen, a
principal reason for floating. Plans could be financed from existing capital, he
said, without the boost a listing would bring.

<P> Expansion so far has been impressive. Apart from the manufacturing division
of the company, InWear has 12 sales companies it owns directly and outlets in 25
countries. It is a major exporter &#173; some 85% of its clothes are sold outside
Denmark. Profits are very healthy: up 90% in the year to June 1996. Den Danske
Bank and Alfred Berg have been appointed co-sponsors for the float.

<P> <B>The Netherlands</B>

<P> <B>SHV Holdings</B> "The market view is that it might happen one day and it
should happen one day, but there is no firm information at the moment," a leading
Dutch broker said recently about the prospects of an SHV Holdings flotation. SHV
was founded in 1896 from a merger of Dutch coal-trading companies. Today it has
two main businesses controlled by an intermediate holding company: SHV Energy,
which produces and trades energy and raw materials, and SHV Makro, which is a
Europe-wide retail company. Both main businesses have subsidiaries worldwide and
total sales are fls26 billion ($4 billion) and income fls829 million.

<P> SHV Holdings' equity is controlled by the Fentener van Vlissingen family and
other members of the board of directors. Total equity is almost fls4.5 billion,
total assets fls13.5 billion and a workforce of 56,000 makes it one of the
largest companies in the Netherlands. A company spokesman says it is not
considering a flotation.

<P> <B>Blokker</B> A large retailer selling mass market household goods and toys,
Blokker has a dominant position in the Netherlands, with 430 stores. It controls
more than half the market for toys and a large part of the household goods
market. "Blokker is a good example of a family company which people say should
list," said a Dutch companies analyst. "It has a strong market presence and would
be a success if it floated." The company declined to make any comment.

<P> <B>Ireland</B>

<P> <B>Dunnes Stores</B> A market-leading Irish supermarket chain owned by the
Dunnes family, Dunnes Stores trades mainly in Northern Ireland. The sector is
highly competitive but dominated by a small number of companies: the top-five
retail organizations account for 71% of market share. Family-owned companies
still control most retailing, but analysts expect this to change as foreign
supermarket chains expand in Ireland. Listed UK supermarket chains Sainsbury and
Asda have both indicated a desire to expand into Ireland and Tesco is likely to
do so soon. The large reserves set aside by these companies for investment far
outweigh the resources of Irish supermarket companies. A flotation by Dunnes
Stores could be a realistic way of financing competition, but the company denies
that it has been considering such a strategy.&#009;*

<H2> <B>Friends of the family</B> </H2> <P> European family-owned companies
considering initial public offerings (IPOs) are beginning to look beyond domestic
exchanges. With the advent of Easdaq (European Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotation) and Euro NM, the two new pan-European exchanges, and the
longer-established US trading system Nasdaq (National Association of Securities
Dealers Automated Quotation), there is now greater choice. All three systems are
actively marketing themselves to European small-cap to mid-cap growth companies.
Many family-owned businesses fall into this category. But the national exchanges
are also realizing the importance of attracting family businesses that might not
feel comfortable with a full listing. In particular, second markets around Europe
are an obvious choice for family companies.

<P> Easdaq is a screen-based trading platform using multiple market-making. It
opened on September 26 and expects to have 15 companies listed by the end of the
year. Investors are able to buy Easdaq-listed stock from broker-dealer members in
15 European countries and the US.

<P> Euro NM is a joint venture between the French Nouveau March&eacute;, the
German Neuer Markt and the Belgian Nouveau March&eacute;. The Dutch second
market, the New Market Amsterdam, was set up in September this year. It will
apply for access to Euro NM. The three existing Euro NM member exchanges have
developed joint marketing and common regulations and will move towards joint
front-end technology for members.

<P> US trading platform Nasdaq lists more than 90 European companies. Fifteen of
these joined in the first eight months of this year, making Nasdaq a serious
challenge to the ambitions of Euro NM and of Easdaq, in which Nasdaq holds a
share. There is no dual-listing agreement between Nasdaq and Easdaq, but if a
company has a Nasdaq listing it will find it easier to get one on Easdaq.

<P> National exchanges still attract companies for reasons of familiarity and
history and some stock exchanges are marketing themselves specifically to
family-owned businesses. The Antwerp stock exchange has been concentrating on
building a relationship with Belgian family companies. Michel Neerink, head of
marketing for the exchange, says the Antwerp exchange aims to be the main Belgian
exchange for the listing of family-owned companies. "We are not looking for
high-tech companies," he says. "We have developed an entirely new stock exchange
system with very attractive procedures for family companies: low cost and high
liquidity." The exchange is not open for trading at the moment, but has amassed a
database of over 700 Belgian family-owned companies that look like suitable
candidates.

<P> The new pan-European exchanges are unlikely to stimulate new listings that
have not already been thought through by companies. Before it started trading,
Easdaq commissioned research from consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand into the
number and type of companies that were likely to consider listing on it. Coopers
found that almost half the firms surveyed had already considered an IPO and were
the sort of candidates Easdaq was seeking to attract. The decision to list had
been made regardless of the opening of Easdaq and Euro NM. Charles Kirwan-Taylor,
managing director of equity capital markets at London-based investment bank BZW,
supports this view: "Euro NM and Easdaq are a response to the desires of the
companies listing. I don't think that setting up an exchange will necessarily
provoke the selling of a business, which is often an intimate decision made
within the family."

<P> Stanlislas Yassukovich, chairman of Easdaq, agrees with this analysis. "They
tend to be companies that have outgrown their local market and have products and
services that start to have a Europe-wide audience. They then have to contemplate
giving up 100% family control in order to raise that capital. That, amongst other
reasons, is one of the main motives behind the whole Easdaq project."

<P> Yassukovich is confident that Easdaq can thrive in an environment which is
well provided with stock markets. He believes Easdaq may end up taking business
away from the national exchanges: "Ultimately, there could be a degree of
migration amongst large and mature companies from the national exchanges to
Easdaq. I think that will only happen when Easdaq has built a network of
broker-dealer membership and a critical mass which makes it an attractive
alternative to national exchanges." But for the first few years of its operation
Easdaq expects to focus on the high-growth, high-tech sector that has found such
success on Nasdaq. A major European software giant comparable to Netscape or
Microsoft would help Easdaq raise its present low profile and convince companies
it is a viable alternative to national exchanges.

<P> In the UK, AIM (the Alternative Investment Market), the London Stock
Exchange's second market has 13 foreign company listings and is looking to add
more. The experience of Ulrik Urban (main story) in turning to AIM is an
indication that the exchange could attract many other continental European
companies since its listing requirements are relatively relaxed. It also has a
higher profile among investors than continental European second markets and so
greater liquidity.

<P> There are complex decisions to be made by companies as more alternative
markets come on stream but one thing that will be uppermost in the minds of CEOs
and their investment banking advisers is the need to go where the money is. What
is good for the Swiss computer software manufacturer that wants to reach the
widest possible selection of investment managers may not be good for the Italian
pasta company for which the number of investors is less important than how
focused they are and how well they understand the peculiarities of the business.
UK property companies, for instance, make up a disproportionate number of
AIM-listed companies since property investment by fund managers is more developed
in the UK than elsewhere in Europe. For a property company there may be no
advantage in tapping into the investment opportunities offered by a pan-European
exchange. The widest possible pool of potential investors is always a good thing,
but that pool could well be found in a company's own country. In fact BZW's
Kirwan-Taylor does not expect small to medium-sized European family companies to
stray too far from their local exchanges. "In a European context, unless there is
a particular reason for going to a foreign bourse &#173; like being involved in a
high-tech sector &#173; most companies would probably attract greatest interest
through their local exchange." The undercapitalized pasta maker in central Italy
may still find that going where the money is means a listing on the Milan Stock
Exchange.

<H3><B>LATIN AMERICA</B></H3>


<H2> <B>The market likes the Latin look</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>Latin America has
returned to the debt markets with a vengeance. The momentum might ease but next
year still promises a large number of issues, reports David Pilling </B> </H4>

<P> Few would have predicted in the dark days that followed Mexico's disastrous
devaluation of December 1994 that investors who had their fingers burnt would
soon be clamouring for Latin debt again. Yet that is what has happened. Latin
America, which appeared to have been shut out of the international capital
markets, is back with a bang.

<P> Sovereign borrowers tentatively began to test their ability to tap the
international markets soon after the initial scare. The response was more
favourable than they could have expected, so much so that the big sovereign
issuers, notably Mexico and Argentina, have since fired a salvo of successful
issues.

<P> The trend gathered pace in 1996. In a November report, Salomon Brothers
announced that "an avalanche of Latin American new issues has swept the
international bond market". Latin issues accounted for 8% of total new
international issues, compared with only 3.5% in 1995 and 5.1% in the previously
record-breaking 1993. The $44 billion issued by end-October contrasts starkly
with the $13.5 billion during the same period of 1995.

<P> "This has been an exceptional year and we will see a number of records broken
in terms of issuance," says Moctar Fall, head of Latin American capital markets
at Salomon Brothers. In 1993, he says, total Latin debt issuance, both sovereign
and corporate, reached $28 billion. "So far this year we are already around $46
billion and we should hit $50 billion by the end of the year very easily."

<P> Joe Cunningham, assistant director for new issues at anz in London, agrees
that 1996 "will be viewed as a watershed year for Latin markets, especially
coming on the back of the tequila crisis of 1994... It was a year when they were
very successful in bringing new issues to market, building a solid base for
future issues."

<P> Several factors explain this success. Primarily, the international
environment was right, the monetary authorities of the world's three largest
lenders &#173; the us, Germany and Japan &#173; all applying relaxed
interest-rate policies. Of the tequila crisis, more than one observer has
commented that, if Latin America had to go through such a test of fire, it picked
just the right moment in which to do so.

<P> "From an external perspective, we were in a global environment flush with
liquidity searching for higher yields," says Larry Goodman, head of Latin
American research at Salomon Brothers. "It has been an environment with just
enough growth in Latin America... but not enough growth in developed countries to
bid up interest rates."

<P> <B>Attractive in Japan</B>

<P> Cesar Miranda, senior vice-president of investment banking for Latin America
at Daiwa Securities, says international liquidity has been the crucial factor in
this year's success. "In Japan, you have a very low interest-rate environment, so
Latin countries from an investor point of view offer very high yields &#173; 4%
or 5% is better than 0.5% any day of the week," he says.

<P> That, aided by the relaxation of rules governing issuance by
below-investment-grade borrowers in Japan, is what sparked the interest of
Japanese investors in Latin America. It enabled Daiwa this year to lead several
successful samurai issues of sovereign Latin debt, including three from Mexico.

<P> In May, Daiwa was appointed lead-manager by Mexico for a &#165;100 billion
10-year samurai issue. The issue was placed at a coupon of 6.75%, accruing
semi-annually, and was followed later in the year by another Daiwa-led Mexican
issue, a &#165;70 billion six-year credit. Argentina, Brazil and Colombia also
tapped the yen market for smaller amounts.

<P> For international funds looking for a home, Latin America proved itself a
less daunting prospect than it had seemed at the time of the tequila crisis. The
three big Latin economies &#173; Argentina, Brazil and Mexico &#173; stuck
rigidly to their domestic economic reforms, as well as to their debt-repayment
schedules.

<P> Although Argentina and Mexico suffered heavy recessions in 1995 as a result
of a shock to confidence and the consequent outflow of capital, both bounced back
in 1996. Furthermore, Mexico, in particular, proved itself adroit at managing its
external debt by ironing out potentially worrying bunching in its amortization
schedule. Perhaps most important of all, the external position of Mexico and
Argentina improved dramatically as recession slowed imports and encouraged
manufacturers to seek new markets abroad.

<P> "The salutary effect of the tequila crisis was a rebalancing of the region's
current account situation," says Goodman. "Import demand shrunk precipitously and
with it there was a virtual elimination of the current account deficits." With
the external position less fragile, lenders were much more willing to buy new
Latin issues.

<P> "This year there has been a gradual improvement in credit fundamentals," says
Tulio Vera, head of sovereign-debt research at Bear Stearns. "Although this has
not yet been manifested in rating upgrades, which always lag, there is a sense
that the economies are slowly recuperating from the events of 1994 and early
1995."

<P> Borrowing demand was also there, driven largely by refinancing needs that
encouraged sovereign states to seek international funds. According to Salomon
Brothers, sovereign, sovereign-guaranteed and sovereign-supported issuance
accounted for 77% of new Latin issue volume in the year to November, completely
overshadowing private-sector borrowing. In the Argentine, Colombian and Mexican
issuer categories, sovereign borrowing constituted 82.6%, 96.1% and 83.4%
respectively of total new-issue volume.

<P> These factors of international liquidity plus a renewed confidence in Latin
sovereign debt markets as relatively safe havens were joined by what Vera sees as
an increasingly ravenous "search for yield. This goes across the board, even in
us equities, where investors are increasingly going into ipos [initial public
offerings] and more speculative investments because the normal bread-and-butter
investments are over-bought or fully priced."

<P> Emerging-market investors were once an odd assortment of hedge funds,
leverage specialists and speculators. Now they have been joined, says Vera, by
"the Fidelities and Puttnams of this world, some of which are putting 5% to 10%
of their investments into emerging-market debt.

<P> "There is a new investor base coming into the market, the cross-over
institutional investors, who were previously dedicated to high-yield or
high-grade assets and are now crossing over into emerging markets," according to
Vera. "People are searching farther and farther into different asset classes and
emerging markets benefit from that, with countries such as Ecuador and Venezuela
the biggest winners. It has been an excellent year for the Brady index which is
up about 28% so far."

<P> Fall of Salomon Brothers agrees: "The biggest trend is that us investors, the
traditional high-yield investors, are becoming a much bigger player in emerging
markets... This will grow in 1997."

<P> <B>Mexico's debt engineering</B>

<P> If the conditions were right, then Latin issuers have taken full advantage.
None has been more expert in exploiting market possibilities than Mexico, which
has used several innovative techniques to improve its external financing
position.

<P> The single most spectacular, though not the largest, issue of 1996 was
arguably Mexico's $1.75 billion Brady swap in April. Under this audacious deal,
investors, many of whom still had the sour taste of tequila in their mouths, were
persuaded to exchange Brady debt collateralized by zero-coupon us treasury bonds
for 30-year paper carrying pure Mexican risk. The launch of the
dollar-denominated global bond with a yield of 552bp over us treasuries was
managed by Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, cj Lawrence and Salomon
Brothers.

<P> "The Brady swap was a big deal. There was a lot of speculation that this
signalled the death of the Brady market," says Cunningham of anz in London. "I
would certainly expect to see more of this type of issue."

<P> "We marked the beginning of the end of the Brady market," says Jorge o
Mariscal, chief equity strategist for Latin America at Goldman Sachs. "We are
creating a whole new family of instruments to replace the Bradys which are a very
inefficient instrument, very expensive."

<P> "Buy-backs are certainly taking off," says Vera. There is constant market
speculation that Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela and other countries are on the
verge of launching similar deals.

<P> "You're going to see more transactions like the Mexican Brady exchange, which
will probably become a model for such deals," he says. "The Brady market as an
asset class has probably reached its peak in terms of volume, with only Peru
still to issue. From then on it will shrink."

<P> Salomon Brothers' Goodman agrees: "There will clearly be a shift from Bradys,
which have obvious complications in terms of collateral and so on, into
instruments of pure risk. That's part of the evolutionary process and a variety
of new instruments will begin to supplant Bradys." But rumours of the death of
Bradys are exaggerated, he says. "When you look at overall stocks, it becomes
clear that Brady bonds will be in existence for some time to come."

<P> Mexico's swap may not have sounded the Brady death knell but it did mark
another clear trend of 1996: better liability management. Many of the Mexican
issues of this year were not intended primarily to raise fresh finance but to
lengthen maturities, lower coupons and smooth out amortization humps.

<P> The most interesting example of such a deal was the issue of a $6 billion
five-year note, said to be the largest Eurobond issue ever. Led by jp Morgan and
Swiss Bank Corporation, the note carried a coupon of 200bp over three-month Libor
with a two-year grace period. The tight spread was achieved because the issue was
collateralized by dollar earnings from state petroleum company Pemex, kept in an
account in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That device, part of what many
analysts see as a general move towards asset-backed issues, earned the note a bbb
minus investment-grade rating from Standard &amp; Poor's &#173; the first time a
Mexican sovereign issue had gained a non-junk rating.

<P> The deal enabled Mexico to pre-pay $8 billion of the $50 billion
international bail-out package spearheaded by the us. In addition to gaining
favour with the us and helping to tighten the spread of future issues, the deal
saved Mexico a cool $125 million in interest.

<P> "Issuance is being used increasingly aggressively as a means of getting the
yield curve down," says Jerome Booth, head of research at anz Bank in London.
"New government issues as well as Brady swaps are being used to retire debt or to
replace existing obligations with debt at lower spreads. Just by issuing, one
tends to send a message to the market that brings the yield curve down."

<P> With a 1996 budget deficit estimated at $6.6 billion and continual
refinancing requirements, Argentina had little choice but to take advantage of
favourable international conditions. It did so hyperactively, raising more than
$10 billion in the international markets.

<P> The Argentine issues were carried out successfully despite extreme political
turbulence at home, which included the surprise dismissal of Domingo Cavallo as
economy minister. But, instead of the economic apocalypse that many had predicted
would follow Cavallo's demise, the new economic team led by Roque Fernandez
quickly won investor confidence by taking a more realistic look at Argentina's
fiscal position. So impressed were investors at the new sense of realism,
underlined by a tough austerity package, that Argentina was able to launch a
30-year dm500 million bond in October.

<P> That issue, led by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, was the first such maturity in
the Euro-Deutschmark sector by an emerging market borrower. It carried a coupon
of 11.75%, or 497bp over Bunds. Ingrid Iversen, an emerging-market specialist at
ubs in New York, says the placement, along with the Mexican Brady swap, was one
of the benchmark deals of 1996 in the sovereign debt markets.

<P> A<B> </B>Salomon Brothers report adds: "The Republic of Argentina has issued
mostly in Deutschmarks with maturities spanning three, seven, 10, 15, 20, and 30
years, effectively establishing a yield curve in this currency sector."

<P> <B>A diversification strategy</B>

<P> Argentina's tapping of the Deutschmark sector also underlines the fact that
sovereign issuers are increasingly issuing in non-dollar currencies as a way of
diversifying obligations. According to figures from Salomon Brothers, 64.2% of
issues in 1996 to November were in us dollars, 19.3% in Deutschmarks, 10.4% in
yen and 6.1% in other currencies. Although this marked something of a return to
the dollar market compared with 1995, it still represents a significant amount of
issuance in the non-dollar sectors.

<P> "Sovereign issues came in almost any currency you can think of," says Miranda
of Daiwa. "Deutschmarks, yen, sterling, Italian lira, and I think even in Swiss
francs." Argentina, which had total financing requirements of some $14 billion in
1996, has become adept at taking advantage of such niches in demand.

<P> "They are definitely ahead of the curve on currency diversification," says
Cunningham of anz. However, he is not sure whether Buenos Aires will be able to
sustain its issuing onslaught on some markets, particularly the German one. "The
appetite in Deutschmarks may be waning," he says. "I think Argentina has raised
so much that it won't be able to go back for a bit. On the other hand, investors
there are now thoroughly familiar with that credit."

<P> If Argentina generally has been very successful with its non-dollar
placements this year, its yankee issues have had more mixed fortunes. Early in
the year, a Credit Suisse First Boston-led $1 billion global bond attracted some
criticism for being overpriced. The 473bp spread widened in the after-market and
traders muttered that the deal had been deliberately over-hyped.

<P> "The Argentine global of 14 February was issued at the peak of the market and
was seen by some as causing the subsequent market downturn," says one analyst.
"It was badly managed."

<P> At the time, dealers were saying that the February placement had damaged
Argentina's possibilities for issuing into the yankee market, and indeed Buenos
Aires did shift its attention to Japanese and European issues in subsequent
months. But by August it was back with a $500 million issue led by jp Morgan, and
on October 1 it entered the 10-year yankee segment with a $1 billion placement
priced at a spread of 445bp.

<P> That issue, led by Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs, was described as an
"incredible success" by one banker. "Argentina worked hard at understanding the
constraints and requirements of the investor... We increased the issue from $750
million to $1 billion, and the amount of orders exceeded $2.6 billion." On the
first day of active trading, the spread widened by between 10bp and 13bp, he
says.

<P> Most of Brazil's financing needs are met by issues of short-term debt on the
domestic market and Brasilia therefore has not been quite as active in the
international markets as Argentina and Mexico. Alone of the Big Three, Brazilian
corporations made up a substantial quantity of total debt issued in 1996.

<P> <B>Brasilia's big comeback</B>

<P> After a number of small deals, though, Brasilia marked its big return to
Eurobond markets with a $750 million five-year note issue on October 29, its
first in the dollar sector since 1982. At the time, Gustavo Franco, director of
the international department at the central bank, described the issue as "the big
test" for his country. "Today we are exposing ourselves to the judgement of the
market," he said.

<P> The deal, which was lead-managed by jp Morgan and sbc Warburg, was trading at
280bp on the day of issue, considered very tight by many traders given the much
higher spreads paid by Mexico and Argentina. The placement attracted heavy
interest from Asian investors, who bought an estimated 40% of the issue.

<P> This year there was also a controversial resolution to the Dart family saga,
a problem created because the Darts had refused to join Brady-style talks in
April 1994 which rescheduled $49 billion of Brazilian debt held by private
creditors. The billionaire Dart family was therefore left holding $1.28 billion
in non-restructured debt and began a series of unsuccessful legal actions against
loan agent Citibank and the Brazilian central bank.

<P> The dispute was settled in October with the issuance of $1.28 billion of
floating-rate notes under us Rule 144a which securitized the remaining multi-year
deposit facility agreement (mydfa) loans. "None of the serious banks would have
anything to do with it because they believed it would sour their relationship
with Brazil," says one analyst.

<P> The mydfa deal was managed by Bear Stearns which, according to a trader from
a rival house, "looked at the pros and cons and decided they could live with it".
Bear Stearns issued the 11-year mydfa restructured notes at a spread of 507bp.
"The investors loved it," says the trader. "[But] a number of people in Brazil
were very upset by this deal. There was concern it would pre-empt or cannibalize
any attempted deal by the Republic of Brazil itself and that it looked like a
clear bail-out of the Dart position."

<P> Another commentator says of Bear Stearns' involvement: "Gustavo Franco [of
the central bank] made it clear that he was not happy they were doing it. By
going ahead, Bear Stearns waved goodbye to Brazil."

<P> After Latin America's Big Three, the main issuer in 1996 was Colombia, which
borrowed nearly $2 billion internationally, roughly doubling its 1995 issuance.
Colombia has always been a hard sell, given that its generally good macroeconomic
fundamentals are marred by the country's reputation for drug trafficking and
violence. But this year was especially complicated because of allegations against
President Ernesto Samper suggesting that his election campaign was part-funded by
drugs dollars. Most of the international placements of 1996 were launched against
the background of impeachment talk.

<P> Salomon Brothers' Fall considers the $400 million Colombian issue of May 22,
joint-led by Salomon and sbc Warburg, as one of the most significant of 1996. The
issue, which was increased from an initial offer of $300 million, was the biggest
in Colombia's history and marked its first in the Eurodollar market since 1993.
The issue, in accordance with Colombian wishes, was distributed to a mainly
European investor base.

<P> "Colombia is a very difficult credit for a lot of investors to understand
because of the high visibility of the drug problem," says Fall. "It gets heavily
punished because of this. us investors have been those most willing to analyze
the credit and take the time to really understand the country. Our challenge was
to educate European investors about the good fundamentals but we were doing this
at a time when the issue of whether the president would be charged or not was
coming to a head."

<P> Fall says the deal was accomplished through constant reaffirmation of
Colombia's solid fundamentals and track record. "No one stopped buying us t-bills
when Nixon was impeached," says Fall. "We had to remind them [European investors]
that no president is bigger than life." The Colombian issue carried a coupon of
8% and the spread narrowed immediately from 150bp to 144bp on the day of pricing.

<P> Despite the extremely favourable conditions in 1996, there were very few new
international issuers. Only Venezuela, which this year signed an imf deal,
returned to the market in style with a dm650 million issue led by Westlb. The
seven-year Eurobond issue, launched on September 12, carried a spread of 440bp
&#173; very respectable given that many investors had considered Venezuela a
virtual basket-case only a few months earlier.

<P> The only other issuer of note was Uruguay, which placed a $100 million
10-year Eurobond at a spread of 160bp, reflecting Montevideo's reputation as a
responsible borrower. The deal was led by cs First Boston.

<P> <B>Can momentum be sustained?</B>

<P> There is some concern among analysts that the exceptional conditions of 1996
cannot be maintained. Few expect 1997 to be as easy for Latin issuers as this
year.

<P> "The countries that have to borrow next year could be vulnerable," says
Iversen of ubs. "This environment is very favourable at the moment and it can't
get a lot better, only worse." Some countries, such as Argentina, plan to tap the
international markets for billions of dollars needed to meet their refinancing
needs. If the markets dried up, for example because of higher international
interest rates, they could run into trouble.

<P> "Naturally, concerns have emerged that if the Federal Reserve raises rates,
activity will screech to a halt," says a Salomon Brothers report. "However,
barring an exaggerated sell-off in the bond market, refinancing needs in 1997
likely will keep Latin American borrowers active in the primary market well into
next year. According to our figures about $16 billion of Latin American external
bonds (excluding Brady bonds and private placements) will mature in 1997 and
1998."

<P> Vera of Bear Stearns believes there is "little threat to global liquidity" in
the immediate future. He is also of the opinion that Latin sovereign issuers will
continue to benefit from the growing sophistication of new investors moving into
the emerging-debt markets. "We're beginning to look at the emerging-market debt
asset class in relation to other asset classes, which provides a relative value
or what I call a value anchor," he says. "Investors used to make relative value
assessments within an asset class, say Argentine Bradys versus Mexican Bradys,
but there was little comparison between Argentine debt and a high-yield issuer in
the us."

<P> Vera says that as the universe of investors in Latin issues expands, yields
will drop. In October, the Brady composite was trading at around 620bp over us
t-bills, while roughly equivalent us asset classes (carrying a bb rating) were
fetching only around 260bp over. "Bradys are still cheap compared with other
asset clasess and you will see a convergence," says Vera.

<P> Although no new Bradys are likely to be issued, with the exception of Peru,
such convergence of yields should make room for issues of other categories of
Latin debt, particularly if spreads look relatively attractive. If conditions
stay broadly favourable in 1997, analysts expect the trend toward better
liability management to continue, with issues whose primary purpose is to improve
a sovereign state's debt-servicing costs and repayment schedule.

<P> "The move towards developing more streamlined yield curves will certainly
continue," says Vera. "Mexico is doing this well, Argentina is also doing it, and
Brazil is beginning to do so with the issue of its [$750 million] global."

<P> Brady swaps in the Mexican manner may become almost commonplace next year,
according to analysts. "The move towards liability management has been
contagious," says Goodman.

<P> Part of liability management should include continued exploitation of
opportunities in the non-dollar markets. "I expect to see the move to currencies
continue," says Vera. "There is a pipeline of potential issuers over the next
five years, mainly Argentina and Mexico, which have the biggest refinancing
needs. The volumes are large, and like any large issuer they will seek to
diversify their funding sources... The move towards yen, Deutschmarks and other
European currencies is here to stay."

<P> If Mexico and Argentina dominated the sovereign issues this year, Brazil is
likely to step up a gear in 1997. Only modest action has been taken in closing
the budget deficit, leaving Brazil with a big borrowing requirement. "I expect
Brazil to be offering more," says Goodman. "It will likely encounter heightened
balance of payments constraints in 1997 and its ability to tap the international
markets [recently tested with the $750 million Euro-issue] could relieve some of
the pressure building up."

<P> Few expect next year to be as good as this, but there is every reason to
believe that Latin American issuance will continue to be strong. And if the
market conditions remain good, the manifest desire of Argentina, Brazil and
Mexico to exploit each and every opportunity could yet mean the shattering of a
few more records in 1997.

<H3><B>LATIN AMERICA</B></H3>



<H2> <B>Seizing the moment</B> </H2> 

<H3> <B>What sovereigns do, corporates will
try to do better. Many have taken advantage of good conditions to stretch
maturities and smooth out repayments. Some Mexican issuers have even managed to
price tighter than their government, reports David Pilling </B> </H3> 

<P> If 1995
was the year that Latin American corporates tentatively dipped their toes into
the international debt and equity markets, this year they waded in up to their
waists. With memories of the Mexican devaluation slowly fading and most Latin
economies beginning to stir from the general slumber of 1995, several companies
began to reconsider raising fresh capital.

<P> Latin American corporations may not have been able to match their hyperactive
governments in the pace of borrowing, but of the $44 billion in Latin bonds
issued by the end of October 1996, $14 billion, nearly a third, was corporate
debt, according to Salomon Brothers. In Brazil, corporates accounted for just
over 40% of new issues, while all $970 million in Chilean debt issues came from
private companies.

<P> Equity issues were more sluggish, but in the first half of 1996 about $650
million was raised by Latin companies through eight American depositary receipt
(adr) placements, according to a report by Bank of New York. This represented a
big increase over the single $58 million issue in the same period of 1995, but
was not yet back to the heady days of the early 1990s.

<P> "You're certainly seeing a pick-up in pace, but as we've seen from the recent
postponement of some deals, it's not plain sailing yet," says David Roberts, head
of Latin American equities at Salomon Brothers. "If a year ago the equity markets
were at three out of 10, now they're at about five or six out of 10," he says.

<P> <B>Peru</B>

<P> Of the big deals in 1996, analysts were almost unanimous in singling out the
Telefonica del Peru flotation in July, which raised nearly $1.25 billion. The
international portion of the sale was coordinated by Merrill Lynch and the
seemingly ever-present jp Morgan. "In Latin America, by far the most significant
corporate deal of 1996 was Telefonica del Peru," says Cesar Miranda, senior
vice-president of investment banking for Latin America at Daiwa Securities, one
of the co-managers for the international launch. "It was a fantastic success
worldwide. It was five times oversubscribed and sent a signal to the market that
Latin American issues were back."

<P> The sale of 26.6% of Telefonica, which was privatized in 1994, provoked great
interest among us investors, who took up 54%. Europeans bought 18%, with the
remaining 28% going to Peruvians under the citizens' participation in
privatization programme. The international portion was raised through a
level-three offering of 29.2 million American depositary shares, with each ads
representing 10 common b shares.

<P> The Peruvian telephone company is controlled by Telefonica de Espana, which
paid a fraction over $2 billion for a majority stake in the original 1994
privatization. Peru has one of Latin America's lowest ratios of telephone lines
to inhabitants, leaving plenty of room for expansion.

<P> Of the July flotation, Miranda says: "If you talk to everybody involved
&#173; from the seller, which was the Peruvian government, to the banks, to the
buyers &#173; everybody was very happy with the issue."

<P> Jorge Mariscal, chief equity strategist for Latin America at Goldman Sachs,
agrees that the Telefonica placement was the most important and one of the best
handled of the year. "It created a benchmark for Peru and a liquid asset to a
market that had enjoyed a radical economic and political turnaround," he says.
"It was perceived as a very well administered issue. It did very well in the
after-market and was well placed. It didn't take advantage of the scarcity of the
paper and generally left a very good flavour."

<P> Mariscal believes that this good reception should help other Peruvian
companies to tap international equity markets. "The history of Latin equity
issues has always begun with telephone companies," he says, pointing to
Argentina's privatization of Entel in 1991 which began a three-year avalanche of
new issues.

<P> Roberts agrees that the Telefonica flotation could make way for other
Peruvian equity issues, such as the forthcoming Luz del Sur adr listing. "When
you get a major corporation from any country listed on the New York Stock
Exchange it adds respectability to other potential issuers and sets a yardstick,"
he says.

<P> For Roberts, what was interesting about the Telefonica sale was that it
attracted institutional buyers not normally associated with Latin America. The
fact that the deal was so heavily oversubscribed shows that the range of
institutional investors willing to buy into what is a relatively minor Latin
market is widening.

<P> The successful Telefonica issue has also cleared a path for the eagerly
awaited sale of most of the Venezuelan government's remaining 49% stake in
telephone company cantv. The multi-tranche issue was joint global managed by sbc
Warburg and Lehman Brothers.

<P> "cantv will double Venezuela's liquid market capitalization," says Mariscal
of the sale, which analysts were expecting would raise between $900 million and
$1 billion. "It will put Venezuela on the map at a time when it is showing signs
of developing an economic responsibility," he says. "It will be a watershed for
the lesser markets and it is an issue worth watching closely."

<P> <B>Chile</B>

<P> Of all Latin American companies, it is those from Chile that enjoy the
easiest and cheapest access to international markets. That is not surprising
given Chile's economic fundamentals, which include nearly 15 years of growth at
an annual average of roughly 6% and minimal reliance on capital inflows.

<P> As a result Chilean electric utilities such as Chilgener, Empresa Electrica
del Norte Grande and Empresa Electrica Pehuenche were able to issue this year at
spreads ranging from a modest 90 basis points to 150bp for eight-year to 10-year
paper. By comparison, Argentine utility Central Puerto y Central Neuquen had to
be content with paying a spread of 414bp for a $100 million, five-year note in an
issue led by Bear Stearns.

<P> Chilean corporate spreads can go even tighter than that. Compania de
Telecomunicaciones de Chile (ctc) raised $200 million at 83bp over us t-bills in
a 10-year yankee placement organized by jp Morgan.

<P> Moctar Fall, head of Latin American capital markets at Salomon Brothers, says
demand for Latin corporate paper is such that smaller companies, as long as they
have "a good story and strong balance sheet", should be able to tap into
international liquidity. "Companies don't have to be large like ypf or Petrobras
for the investors to do the credit work and really pile into it," he says.

<P> A case in point, says Fall, was a Salomon-led issue by the Chemical Mining
Company of Chile (Soquimich), which produces specialist fertilizers and iodine.
The September issue raised $200 million in the yankee market, at a spread of just
100bp for 10-year paper. It was Soquimich's first time in the debt market, but
such was the interest that the issue was "substantially oversubscribed",
resulting in about $1 billion in orders. Although the issue was priced
aggressively in comparison with other bbb rated Chilean groups, the spread
tightened in the secondary market during October to 93bp.

<P> <B>Brazil</B>

<P> Brazilian groups were the busiest corporate issuers of 1996, with a total of
$4.2 billion of debt placed by the end of October. "Brazilian corporates were
very active this year, which was not the case in 1995," says Fall.

<P> Much of the corporate debt was issued by banks, more than 30 of which placed
notes in the first 10 months of 1996, raising a total of about $2.5 billion. Most
of this money was for on-lending, taking advantage of the large disparity between
Brazilian and international spreads.

<P> "Brazilian banks have done an excellent job in issuing," says Joe Cunningham,
assistant director for new issues at anz in London. Many analysts do not regard
banks as true corporates, but such niceties do not alter the fact that investors
continue to have a healthy appetite for bank assets, says Cunningham. He points
to a three-year, $50 million issue by Banco bmg, led by anz, as an example of how
even second-tier Brazilian banks enjoy access to the international capital
markets. "It's no longer just a market for the top-name banks," he says.

<P> Of the non-bank issues, the first big deal was that of state-owned mining
conglomerate Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (cvrd), which launched a $300 million,
eight-year Euronote in March. Chase-Chemical was the lead manager for an issue
that attracted much attention given that cvrd is expected to privatize early in
1997. The issue was priced to yield a spread of 400bp. The privatization is
likely to be one of the biggest ever in Latin America.

<P> "cvrd was the only large issue we had seen from Brazil at that time," says
Fall of the March deal. "It came when there was a lot of speculation about the
privatization of cvrd itself, a situation that should become clearer in January
of next year."

<P> Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso recently reaffirmed that the
cvrd sell-off, which international traders had been hoping for in 1996, would go
ahead early in 1997 despite opposition in the senate.

<P> The privatization is due to take place in February with a block sale of
between 40% and 45% of voting shares, to be followed immediately by the offer of
10% of cvrd's total capital to staff. In June, there will be a public offering of
the remaining shares on domestic and international markets. The government owns
76% of cvrd's voting capital, equivalent to 51% of the company's total capital.

<P> Miranda of Daiwa Securities says this pattern will be repeated in several
other privatizations due next year. "What the Brazilians do when they privatize
is to sell to a strategic investor who knows the business, and then bring an
international offering to market several months later," he says.

<P> Issues of non-state-owned Brazilian corporates this year included a $150
million eight-year Euronote from retail chain Lojas Americanos, which was placed
privately by jp Morgan. The issue carried a coupon of 11%, representing a spread
of 450bp.

<P> Globo Participacoes, on behalf of the Globo media group, issued a $100
million, eight-year note, with the deal managed by Chase Investment Bank. The
issue carried a spread of 395bp and was followed up with a $50 million, two-year
bond priced at 297bp and managed by Citibank International. Globo also launched a
$33 million, eight-year Eurobond denominated in Portuguese escudos.

<P> Cunningham says the Globo $100 million note stands out among the year's
corporate bond placements in that it was "a fairly large issue that has gone down
well at a reasonable spread". These type of deals "lay the foundation for future
issues, not just for the company concerned but for others," he says.

<P> <B>Mexico</B>

<P> Of the $18.2 billion of Mexican bond issues in the first 10 months of 1996, a
little over $3 billion was corporate issuance. Some Mexican companies rode on the
coat-tails of their issue-happy government and emulated the state by tapping
international funds in order to stretch out debt maturities and resolve potential
amortization bunching problems.

<P> In 1992 and 1993, many Mexican companies had issued three- to five-year
paper, much of which is about to come due. Many of those companies that enjoy
fairly fluid access to international financing took advantage of the market's
receptiveness to longer-term paper to stretch out their yield curves.

<P> In May, broadcaster Grupo Televisa placed $970 million in notes and
debentures to help smooth out its repayment schedule. Morgan Stanley led three
private placements of seven- to 10-year paper totalling $600 million into the
yankee market.

<P> Cemex also restructured about $1.3 billion of its debt, pushing the
maturities out. "The paper they were assigning in 1995 and in the early part of
1996 was very short term paper and these companies need to be capitalizing with
longer-term paper. That is their goal," Saboni Warner, Bear Stearns construction
analyst, said at the time of the deal.

<P> The Cemex restructuring included the placement of two Eurobonds of $300
million each. Goldman Sachs led the issues of four-year and 10-year paper, which
carried spreads of 425bp and 587bp, respectively.

<P> Grupo Industrial Durango also said it would use the proceeds of a $250
million, seven-year yankee issue to refinance a portion of its debt and related
expenses. Lead-managed by Chase Securities, the note was priced to yield a spread
of 592bp.

<P> Another deal highlighted by analysts was that of Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex),
Mexico's state-owned petroleum company, which issued two $300 million Eurobonds
this year. The first, a two-year Eurobond priced to yield 190bp over us
treasuries, was led by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and jp Morgan. The second,
managed by ubs, was priced at 175bp.

<P> The two deals highlighted the tightening of yields that took place for much
of 1996 and showed that corporate issues can be priced at tighter spreads than
those of their sovereign state. Mexican debt issues generally fetch significantly
wider spreads. "Investors are now focusing much more on the [risk of the
individual] credit than on the sovereign issue," says Fall.

<P> Some analysts believe this trend is flawed and that a corporate credit should
never trade at tighter spreads than the relevant sovereign debt. "Sovereign risk
is more difficult to understand, whereas accountancy-minded analysts can easily
come to grips with a company's balance sheet," says one sovereign debt analyst of
a us asset-management fund. "But can a corporate credit ever be less risky than
the ambient sovereign risk? The ultimate risk of any corporate is
expropriation... There is a strong argument that all [emerging market] corporate
debt is simply too expensive."

<P> <B>Argentina </B>

<P> Less than a fifth of Argentine debt issues by volume so far this year has
been made up by corporates &#173; a total of around $1.95 billion. Such is the
voraciousness of the Argentine state's appetite for borrowing, fuelled by
pressing refinancing needs, that many companies have been squeezed out of the
picture. In any case, few Argentine companies are in a hurry for fresh funds
given that the economy is only just beginning to pull out of last year's
recession.

<P> "A danger here, especially in the case of Argentina, is that the government
is crowding out the private sector," says Cunningham of anz. "Credit lines are
only so deep, so if a government is continually issuing, buyers will usually go
for the sovereign credit above the corporate one."

<P> Some Argentine corporates did manage to break through the saturation barrier.
Among them was debt-laden, energy-based conglomerate Comercial del Plata, which
in February issued a two-year, $100 million Eurobond, lead-managed by Paribas
Capital Markets. The effect of sovereign overkill in the markets was manifested
in the spread Comercial was obliged to pay &#173; a hefty 560bp.

<P> A few months later Comercial was back, again with Paribas, this time with a
$125 million, four-year private placement priced to yield 525bp over t-bills.
Comercial was also considering a New York ads listing, but abandoned its plans
when the group's share price took a heavy knock.

<P> Other Argentine companies to issue bonds in 1996 were mainly utilities,
including Metrogas, Transportadora Gas del Sur, Transportadora Gas del Norte, and
Hidroelectrica Piedra del Aguila. Also oil and gas group Bridas, which is bent on
international expansion, launched two private issues totalling $175 million. Both
deals were led by Chase Investment Bank.

<P> In the semi-corporate category, state-owned mortgage bank Banco Hipotecario
(bhn) launched two mortgage-backed bonds worth a total $80 million. The bonds,
with maturities of 3.4 years and 1.6 years, were both priced to yield spreads of
175bp. The deal was managed by cs First Boston.

<P> One trader from a rival bank described the spreads on the bhn deal as
"ridiculous". In the case of default, the trader asked, were investors really
going to go to Buenos Aires to take possession of their collateral?

<P> The trend towards asset-backed issues has nevertheless taken hold, with the
Province of Mendoza in August issuing a $150 million bond backed by oil royalties
that it receives from five concessions. Lead manager in that deal was Lehman
Brothers.

<P> In late-October, the gas-rich province of Neuquen announced that it was about
to launch a similar royalty-backed deal, collateralized by payments made to the
province by privatized hydrocarbons group ypf.

<P> Salomon Brothers says an Argentine corporate deal that did stand out in a
fairly lacklustre year was one it lead-managed for Siderar, a steel group
controlled by the Techint conglomerate. The $80 million ipo, which was sold via
Rule 144a, was the first Argentine industrial company to list internationally.

<P> The deal also marked what many analysts hope will be a growing trend in Latin
America &#173; the participation of domestic institutions, mainly pension funds,
in issues. Of the Siderar offer, 47.8% was bought domestically, reflecting the
fact that local private pension funds (afjps) were allowed to participate in a
global offering for the first time.

<P> "This transaction has effectively opened the domestic market for
international offerings," says a report from Salomon Brothers. "Local
participation from institutional funds will become an important and powerful
vehicle for development of the domestic capital markets."

<P> "The us equity business has been built up mainly on selling us stocks to us
investors, while the European market tends to sell European shares to European
investors," says Salomon's Roberts. "But Latin American business has been built
up by selling Latin American stocks to anyone but Latin Americans. This is
beginning to change ... We are starting to see serious [local] institutional
buying."

<P> Roberts thinks this trend, only properly established in savings-rich Chile,
will start to become more evident in Mexico following the start of a private
pension fund programme there. Other countries will follow as cash-strapped
governments shift from pay-as-you-go pension schemes to private plans based on
individual capitalized accounts.

<P> Looking ahead to next year, Mariscal of Goldman Sachs believes opportunities
for Latin corporate issues will grow. "The percentage of funds allocated to Latin
America [by us and other institutions] is likely to edge up," he says. "The bulk
of equity issuance in 1997 is probably going to be in Brazil, with a lot in the
utility industries." Mexican companies are also likely to become more active.
Some of the forthcoming Brazilian equity issues will be "mind-boggling" in size,
he says.

<P> Nevertheless, "investors are likely to be very selective and will only pick
companies with very strong balance sheets," he cautions. "The memories of Mexico
are likely to linger on for a few years yet."

<H3><B>LATIN AMERICA</B></H3>



<H2> <B>Crazy man in power</B> </H2> 

<H3> <B>Ecuador's populist new president
came to power on a wave of dissatisfaction with the status quo. He has already
developed a reputation for eccentricity, not least for economic policies that
threaten to alienate the international community. There is also worrying evidence
of cronyism and an authoritarian approach to foreign investors. By Norman
Peagam</B> </H3> 

<P> During his first 100 days as president of Ecuador, Abdala
Bucaram shaved off his moustache to raise money for charity, staged a concert to
perform songs from his forthcoming album, "A Crazy Man In Love", and hosted a
lunch at the presidential palace for Lorena Bobbitt, an Ecuadorean best known for
cutting off her American husband's penis. A tireless self-promoter, the
44-year-old Bucaram also gave his monthly salary to poor people and arranged for
the distribution of subsidized milk to the needy, in plastic cartons bearing his
picture and the brand-name Abdalact. To those who suggest he might spend more
time on government business, he retorts: "I do as I damn well please."

<P> Bucaram was the surprise winner of Ecuador's presidential election this year.
An unabashed populist who promised to champion the poor and hound the elite, he
took office on August 10 and has continued his strident rhetoric since. But
behind the combative language and grandstanding, advisers say he has a serious
purpose. He thinks Ecuador lacked strong leadership in the past and needs shaking
up. Like presidents Carlos Menem in Argentina and Alberto Fujimori in Peru &#173;
also ethnic minority outsiders &#173; they say Bucaram plans far-reaching
political and economic reforms that could enhance Ecuador's prospects for growth
and stability.

<P> "Bucaram wants to change the country," says Jose Mantilla, adviser to central
bank general manager Augusto de le Torre. "He wants to go down in history as the
best president that Ecuador ever had. He wants to be known throughout the world
not as the new Menem, but as what Menem could have been. He aspires to grandeur."
As a result, says Mantilla, he will propose "probably the most significant
transformation of Ecuador's economic institutions since the 1920s, when most of
them were created".

<P> First, Bucaram hopes to change the constitution so he can run for re-election
in 2000 and lead the country into the 21st century. He also wants to give the
judiciary greater autonomy; at present the courts are an appendage of congress,
with judges appointed on a political basis. In addition, he would make the
central bank and monetary board more independent, create a new framework for
implementing fiscal policy and abolish so-called strategic industries, opening
them up to private-sector investment. Despite his populist image, advisers say he
may also embrace orthodox recommendations by the World Bank to reduce subsidies,
tax evasion, tax exemptions, free university education and heavy government
regulation of the labour market, since these distortions actually benefit the
well-off at the expense of the poor.

<P> Most controversially, Bucaram wants to adopt the so-called convertibility
plan which ended hyperinflation in Argentina by legislating a fixed exchange rate
and a requirement for the monetary base to be fully backed by international
reserves. He has even recruited former Argentine finance minister Domingo Cavallo
as a part-time adviser (with the multilateral development agency Corporacion
Andina de Fomento footing the bill). The fact that Ecuador has traditionally
enjoyed relative monetary stability, unlike Argentina and most of Latin America,
has not dimmed his enthusiasm; Bucaram seems convinced that parity with the us
dollar is the best way to reduce inflation and interest rates.

<P> Many economists and business people &#173; even some of Bucaram's ministers
&#173; disagree, arguing that parity is unnecessary and could be harmful. As a
small, open economy dependent on a few products and vulnerable to external
shocks, they say, Ecuador should retain fiscal and monetary flexibility rather
than imposing a straitjacket on itself. While parity might benefit importers, who
happen to be among Bucaram's biggest supporters, opponents say it could hurt
exports and the economy in general, especially if the government cannot maintain
a balanced budget. "If you don't have credibility, the convertibility plan could
be a time-bomb, both economically and socially," says Alfredo Gallegos, president
of the American Chamber of Commerce in Quito. "That's what people fear."

<P> Bucaram's many critics are deeply sceptical about his economic reform plans,
not least because he had failed to announce details of the programme as of late
November, missing repeated deadlines. Although taking some comfort from the fact
that he has broadly followed the economic policies of his predecessor, they point
to some disturbing trends since the new administration came to power; Bucaram has
surrounded himself with friends and relatives, raising questions of nepotism and
conflict of interest, and has appeared to condone strong-arm tactics in dealings
with business people, including foreign investors.

<P> In view of the prevailing uncertainty, bankers say investment is stagnating
and money leaving the country. The sluggish economy is unlikely to revive soon,
although high oil prices are helping to contain the government's budget deficit.
Nevertheless, Ecuador's dollar-denominated Brady bonds have been stellar
performers in the international secondary market this year, gaining more than 55%
in value as emerging-market investors have reached for the highest spreads
available in Latin America. In addition, despite the fact that Ecuador is in
arrears on some of its external debt, foreign banks have been trying to organize
a $300 million trade facility for Petroecuador, the state oil company, and
government officials say Chase Manhattan Bank will soon launch a $300
million-$400 million Eurobond offering on behalf of the republic. (Chase declines
to comment.)

<P> Ecuador is one of the poorest countries in South America, with a 1995 per
capita gdp of about $1,500 and a highly uneven distribution of wealth. More than
a third of its 11.5 million people live in poverty and nearly half its children
under five suffer from malnutrition. The indigenous Indian population is
especially disadvantaged, while a wealthy, largely European elite has
traditionally run the country, mainly for its own benefit. The leading population
centres are Quito, the capital, in the mountains of the Sierra and the port of
Guayaquil on the Pacific coast. Ecuador earns $3 billion to $4 billion a year
from exports, with oil shipments accounting for over a third of the total,
followed by bananas, shrimps, coffee and cocoa.

<P> A latecomer to industrialization in the 1960s, Ecuador embraced the
conventional wisdom of the day, pursuing import-substitution policies and state
intervention. The discovery of oil in 1967 led to a boom when oil prices soared,
enticing foreign banks to lend the country large amounts. But the collapse of oil
prices in the 1980s and Ecuador's failure to adjust left it unable to repay its
foreign debt, not for the first time. In 1992, the government of president Sixto
Duran Ballen began to implement orthodox economic reforms and in early 1995
successfully completed a Brady Plan debt restructuring which normalized relations
with foreign creditors. But forward momentum was then lost because of a border
conflict with Peru, power shortages and a political crisis in which the country's
vice-president resigned and fled to Costa Rica after being accused of corruption.

<P> <B>Success by no means assured</B>

<P> In this year's election campaign, Bucaram was able to ride a wave of
dissatisfaction with the status quo among voters, and his reform programme may
appeal to their desire for change &#173; especially if, as expected, it is
accompanied by increased social spending. But its success is by no means assured.
First, his proposals will almost certainly require major constitutional and other
legal changes, which may not be easy to achieve; much will depend on Bucaram's
buying power in congress, where his party occupies 19 of the 82 seats. As a
recent commentary by brokerage firm Investunion points out, "As long as [his
party] can exchange votes for money or positions of power, it will receive the
backing of deputies from other political parties." Second, there is reason to
doubt the depth of Bucaram's commitment to reform, because he has already
backtracked on several issues and given wildly conflicting signals.

<P> For example, he has spoken out clearly in favour of foreign investment. But
his government arrested officials of two European import-verification companies
and held them in jail without due process, alleging under-reporting of imports;
after a couple of weeks, it had to release them for lack of evidence. Bucaram
himself ordered the country's largest cement company, a private-sector joint
venture with Holderbank of Switzerland, to close because it raised prices,
although the order was rescinded at the last minute. And his minister of energy
threatened to send in the military to shut down the drilling operations of a
Latin American oil company unless it agreed to renegotiate its contract with the
government.

<P> "These are basically strong-arm tactics, intimidation tactics; 'Agree to our
terms by the end of the day or we'll expropriate you'," says a foreign
businessman in Quito. Noting that foreign investors value contract inviolability
above almost everything else, he says, "Certainly these tactics call contract
sanctity into question." But, he adds, while "there is a fair degree of political
risk here right now... I think cooler heads will prevail in the end."

<P> Some critics question whether the government is capable of carrying out the
reforms. For one thing, the new administration appears to be in some disarray,
partly because Bucaram insists on making all decisions himself while keeping no
set work schedule and flying around the country. "It's a total madhouse," a
former official tells friends. "This man is so totally disorganized and so
totally unpredictable, it's almost impossible to function." In addition, there is
widespread concern that he does not have the right people around him (with the
notable exception of central bank general manager de la Torre, held over from the
previous administration). Symbolizing the problem, his minister of education
stands accused of plagiarism for writing a book which bears remarkable
similarities to somebody else's unpublished thesis; excoriated by Ecuador's
freewheeling press, she has so far refused to resign.

<P> But the problem goes much deeper. When he took office, Bucaram fired many
government workers and replaced them with political appointees. For instance, he
reportedly dismissed 400 of the 600 employees at Banco del Estado, the state
development bank, and all 200 personnel at the drug-control agency, filling the
vacancies with his own people. A sports fanatic who still has the energy to play
soccer and basketball, he even gave some positions to his soccer friends. "From
ministers down, all are basically political appointees with no prior government
experience and often little or no education," says a senior official who survived
the purge.

<P> Bucaram himself is a lawyer by training and a descendant of Lebanese
immigrants who moved to Guayaquil earlier this century; arriving from the Ottoman
empire on Turkish passports, they were labelled "turcos" and the derogatory term
is still used. While others in the city's Lebanese community were making money in
business &#173; typically as importers who, by all accounts, often under-reported
the value of what they were importing &#173; Bucaram became a professional
politician, funded by them. He lived off contributions, ran repeatedly for
office, won election as mayor of Guayaquil and became wealthy. However, he twice
spent periods of exile in Panama, once after denigrating the military and once
after being accused of embezzlement as mayor. (His sister, Elsa, later served as
mayor of Guayaquil; she also fled to Panama after being accused of pocketing city
funds. The supreme court recently dismissed these charges.)

<P> Bucaram's inner circle consists of friends from the Lebanese business
community in Guayaquil. Each has been placed in a key position. They include
Miguel Salem, his chief of staff; Omar Quintana, in charge of privatization, and
minister of energy Alfredo Adum. Given the large amounts that could be raised
through privatization, Quintana's appointment raised eyebrows because he was once
convicted of illegal business practices. A major importer, Adum is a long-time
supporter who reportedly underwrote Bucaram's sojourns in Panama. Newspaper
accounts of his behaviour in office have evoked widespread criticism; in addition
to intemperate language and loudly refusing to hand over his gun to airport
security personnel, Adum has been accused of striking a female employee in the
face and holding a gun to the head of another employee. He denies the charges.

<P> Alongside these friends, Bucaram has called on relatives to fill some
positions. His brother Adolfo is minister of social welfare; his brother-in-law,
Pablo Concha, is minister of finance, and his sister Elsa, recently returned from
Panama, is said to be a presidential adviser. In the congress, a second brother
is vice-president of the budget commission and a third brother is vice-president
of the economic commission and the new head of Ecuador's Olympic Comittee.

<P> Bucaram has also named three Guayaquil bankers to senior jobs, although it is
unclear whether they wield much influence. Roberto Isaias is chief economic
adviser; of Lebanese descent, he and his family control Filanbanco, the country's
largest bank (and one of its least profitable). Alvaro Noboa is chairman of the
monetary board; a son of the late Luis Noboa, Ecuador's bananas and shipping
tycoon, he has not displayed his father's business talents and headed the small
Banco Litoral until recently. And David Goldbaum is president of the Corporacion
Financiera Nacional, a development agency; he and his family own Banco
Territorial.

<P> <B>Dubious linkages</B>

<P> Some of Bucaram's appointments pose huge conflict-of-interest problems. For
example, Adum's principal assistant at the energy ministry is Maria Fernanda
Penafiel; her family owns Tripetrol, Ecuador's leading private oil company.
Isaias is privy to pending legislation governing banks, even though his family
owns a major bank. He also has a stake in the cable tv monopoly, which has built
a fibre-optic network across the country and could be a major beneficiary of
telecom privatization. In a possible sign of things to come, Petroecuador
recently cancelled its existing insurance policies, giving the business to
companies controlled by Roberto Isaias, David Goldbaum and their families.

<P> Bucaram himself sets the tone. He apparently loathes the capital, Quito, and
rarely visits it. When he does so, he shuns the presidential palace and prefers
to stay at the privately owned Hotel Colon, which provides him with free
accomodation. But, as a banker in Quito remarks, "If he's not paying, who is
paying and what is he getting in return?" There have been other straws in the
wind. After taking office, Bucaram flew his obese son to Miami for medical
treatment at government expense. When his son was jeered by other patrons at a
nightclub, the club was ordered to close. As mayor of Guayaquil, Bucaram is said
to have harassed and intimidated people who got in his way. In a country with
chronically weak institutions, some observers fear there has been abuse of power.
Investunion, a subsidiary of Banco Union, warns of "emerging signs of intolerance
and authoritarianism".

<P> On the economic front, however, Bucaram's room for manoeuvre is limited,
unless he wants to sever relations with the international financial community.
Ecuador is about $200 million in arrears to the Paris Club, representing
governments of industrialized nations, and wants to renegotiate the terms of its
Paris Club debt to ease the country's overall debt burden. (Total external debt
service this year will consume about 37% of projected budget revenues.) To
bolster its international credibility, the government must also reach a standby
credit agreement with the imf, which will require it to achieve and maintain a
balanced budget by increasing tax revenues and rationalizing spending. This will
make it difficult for Bucaram to fulfil his lavish campaign promises, which
included increasing education spending and building 200,000 units of low-income
housing.

<P> But he may be able to avoid tough choices by accelerating Ecuador's
privatization programme. Currently, the government is planning to sell 35% of the
national telephone company to an international operator in April for perhaps $700
million-$900 million and to invite private-sector participation in electricity
generation and distribution. The government is also in the process of converting
the risk service contracts of foreign oil companies into participation contracts,
which will provide it with a guaranteed stream of income from producing
oilfields.

<P> However, until the new government begins to chart its own course and make
decisions, the country's prospects remain highly uncertain, given Bucaram's
populist inclinations and his current popularity among low-income voters. "It's a
very confusing situation; the parameters aren't clear by any means, the jury's
still out," says a foreign banker in Quito. "Ecuador is now at a crossroads,"
adds Jose Mantilla, the central bank adviser. "Decisions made over the next few
months will probably determine what Ecuador will be like over the next 40-50
years and whether it will realize its development potential, which is pretty big,
or whether it will stay an economic backwater, a forgotten country."

<H3><B> EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION </B></H3>


<H2> <B>The outside view</B> </H2> 

<H4> <B>What will be the effect of European
economic and monetary union (Emu) on the rest of the world? Will the euro be
strong or weak? How will Emu affect world trade and global currency coordination?
There are plenty of wild guesses. David Shirreff consults a handful of
experts</B> </H4> 

<P> <B>The ECB and the euro</B>

<P> The popular perception that the European Central Bank (ECB) will be as tough
and even tougher than the Bundesbank is giving way to fears of sluggish economic
growth in Europe and the likelihood of weak aggregate demand and a weaker euro.
The growing possibility of Italy and Spain joining Emu in the first wave adds
fuel to the weak euro view.

<P> "In the long term the euro is likely to be a weak currency, to create
growth," says John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International in London.
"But short-term the European Central Bank will keep the euro strong, to establish
credibility." The Deutschmark, because it is a major currency in Europe but small
by the standards of the dollar and the yen, tends to get driven artificially high
on occasions, notes Kenneth Courtis, senior economist at Deutsche Bank Group Asia
Pacific. Because it would be a broader-based reserve currency than the
Deutschmark, the euro "wouldn't be bounced around in the same way", he says.

<P> A clue to how the ECB may behave lies in a comparison between the US as a
trading bloc and the external trade of the Emu bloc after monetary union. Patrick
Artus, chief economist at Caisse des D&eacute;p&ocirc;ts et Consignations in
Paris, notes that a high proportion (between 45% and 70%) of the external trade
of EU nations is with other EU members. Depending on how many join Emu, the value
of exports by these countries outside the Emu block could be as little as 11% of
their combined GDP. US exports account for around 10% of GDP (see chart page
114). So, argues Artus, while the Bundesbank has always been concerned about the
external value of the Deutschmark, the ECB will be less concerned and is likely
to behave more like the US Federal Reserve &#173; pursuing internal price
stability, but largely indifferent to the impact of the exchange rate on foreign
trade.

<P> Europe will become more of a large, closed economy, rather like the US,
affirms Barry Eichengreen, professor of economics and political science at the
University of California at Berkeley. "There will be less of a preoccupation with
the external value of the euro." He notes that foreign exchange markets can see
great movements in the dollar, as much as 3% a month, month after month in the
same direction. "The same could be true of the euro against the dollar."

<P> <B>US fears of Fortress Europe</B>

<P> US concerns in general have been more about the single European market than
about Emu. There was huge interest from the US at the launch of the single market
in 1992, but Emu has been greeted largely with indifference. "Most Americans have
not heard about Emu, and those who did could not care less," noted a Deutsche
Bank Research report this summer. "Even among the intellectual elite, Emu is more
associated with the big bird roaming the Australian outback than with monetary
union," wrote the report's author, Mieczyzlaw Karczmar. "Since then I haven't
changed my view," he told <I>Euromoney</I> last month.

<P> There are US concerns about the development of a protective trading bloc
&#173; Fortress Europe. Courtis at Deutsche Bank notes that for the last 15 years
there has been an increase in intra-European trade at the expense of a
"substantial decline in trade with the rest of the world". Economic stagnation
among Emu countries &#173; caused by the efforts to conform to Maastricht
criteria and the strictures of German finance minister Theo Waigel's proposed
stability pact &#173; could lead to protectionist trade measures, warn some US
observers. This is possible, admits Eichengreen, but it wouldn't be like the
1930s. "Today there are institutions, such as the World Trade Organization, to
mediate trade conflict," says Eichengreen. Moreover, a more flexible and more
deregulated European economy should make for better market access, he believes.

<P> Every year someone in the US warns about Fortress Europe, says Peter Kenen,
professor of economics and international finance at Princeton University, "but it
ain't there".

<P> <B>And a diminished dollar</B>

<P> Kenen dismisses another US concern that, after Emu, the European system of
central banks will find itself with excess reserves and start disposing of
dollars. "There will be an automatic contraction of reserves," says Kenen. "The
Deutschmarks which account for 25% of the reserves of other European countries
will become euros and no longer count as reserves." Moreover, he points out,
Germany and Japan have for years held excess reserves because they don't want to
depress the dollar. And the euro is likely to undergo gradual depreciation, not
appreciation, making it less attractive as a reserve currency.

<P> Worries about the reserve status of the dollar are "a tempest in a teapot",
says Eichengreen. Such a status is a function of history, he points out: sterling
is still important as a reserve currency on the basis of 19th-century trade
flows. Only in eastern Europe could the euro quickly become the preferred reserve
currency because of newly established trading patterns &#173; but that is already
happening with the Deutschmark. "One can imagine a day in the 22nd century when
the euro will rival the dollar," says Eichengreen.

<P> <B>Central Europe out in the cold</B>

<P> A more general worry &#173; shared with the British Eurosceptics &#173; is
what happens to the European countries outside Emu, and to the dream of a wider
EU that embraces Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and other former eastern
bloc members. "I'm concerned for countries which are not in the first wave," says
Charles Dallara, former US executive director of the IMF and now managing
director of the Institute of International Finance (IIF) in Washington. "Will
they face a challenge of credibility? Will it create a schism such as we almost
saw four years ago when the lira and sterling were forced out of the ERM
[exchange rate mechanism]? There is a long-term risk in leaving the Czechs, Poles
and others outside the net for too long."

<P> <B>Emu's inflexible structure</B>

<P> Dallara also questions the fundamental precept of Emu: "Is it part of the
structure that will create jobs and wealth in Europe?" He sees shortcomings in
the Maastricht criteria: "They were structured without any reference to
flexibility in the agriculture and labour markets, or privatization." They
omitted one important aspect &#173; "structural change".

<P> <B>What happens to G7?</B>

<P> As a former multilateral official Dallara wonders about the geo-financial
effect of Emu: "What is the framework of [international financial] coordination?
Does the G7 become the G3 or G4?" Some officials are already referring to the
"Quad" &#173; the US, Canada, Japan, and Europe.

<P> <B>Will Emu stimulate trade?</B>

<P> Kenen sees the impact of Emu being not external but mostly internal, where it
will "remove barriers to internal transactions". There is good quantitative
evidence, he says, that trade between the US and Canada is much smaller than it
should be, probably because of the exchange rate barrier.

<P> European companies would argue that they are more used to trading in a
multi-currency area. Unless Emu is extremely wide they will still have six or
seven European currencies to deal with.

<P> <B>Swiss concerns</B>

<P> "Switzerland should be worried about practically everything," says Kenen at
Princeton. It seems that, whatever financial-economic strategy it adopts, it will
lose out from monetary union. If investors continue to regard Switzerland as a
safe haven then the upward pressure on the Swiss franc will murder the country's
competitiveness in manufacturing. If investors lose their appetite for Swiss
franc assets then the country will experience a decline in one of its most
important sectors, private banking and fund management.

<P> A recent study concluded for the Swiss National Bank outlines the dilemma for
management of monetary policy. If the franc tracks the euro too closely and
explicitly then it risks losing the 2% interest rate differential that it enjoys
at the long end of the yield curve. If the franc stays too independent it will
appreciate against the euro, with dire effects on Swiss competitiveness.

<P> <B>Exchange controls?</B>

<P> The study offers several strategies to steer a middle course, but it warns
that whatever the Swiss National Bank (SNB) does, the markets will want to test
how far it will support a range for the Swiss franc/euro rate.

<P> Intervention by the SNB using foreign currency "can hardly influence the
exchange rate", the report says. A dual exchange rate is considered &#173;
applying different parities for balance-of-payments and capital-account
transactions; but that is quickly dismissed as contrary to free-market
principles.

<P> The idea of applying varied pricing according to economic entity is explored
and likewise dismissed. An example is quoting prices in Italian lire, lower than
Swiss franc prices, in Ticino (the Italian-speaking canton of Switzerland), for
the benefit of Italian tourists.

<P> <B>Lower rates, but not minus rates</B>

<P> Given the extreme delicacy of the Swiss situation, with an overvalued
currency and very high production, labour and social costs, Josef Marbacher,
chief economist at Bank Julius Baer, was shocked when the SNB raised short-term
rates to 2.5% three months ago.

<P> He was mightily relieved when the rate was lowered again in October to below
2%, assisting the 5% fall in the currency against the Deutschmark over the last
three months. "This shows they have the intention to have a weaker Swiss franc,"
says Marbacher.

<P> But he draws the line at negative interest rates, which Switzerland tried in
the 1970s to discourage capital inflows. He was at the Swiss National Bank at the
time. "It's such a nonsense," Marbacher says. "It's absolutely impossible with
today's options and futures markets."

<P> <B>Ahead on structural reform</B>

<P> Marbacher doesn't share the pessimistic view of Switzerland; he says it is
ahead of the rest of continental Europe in Thatcherite structural reform, and
that explains the "bad mood" prevailing in the country: "Switzerland is far
behind Europe in GDP growth, with stagnation for six years now," he says.
"Switzerland must make enormous efforts to destroy the historical structure
&#173; it's the most cartelistic system in Europe &#173; and we need an open
economy. But we have a great advantage &#173; it's similar to what Thatcher did
in the UK, destroying the structure with shock therapy. Of course there's a bad
mood [in the country], and that's the main reason why consumption isn't working.
But compared with Germany, Switzerland is in a better position." Although
Switzerland is in the heart of European trade flows, its future is not within the
European Union or Emu, he believes.

<P> <B>Sweden's dilemma</B>

<P> Nils Gottfries, professor of economics at Uppsala University in Sweden, was a
dissenting voice in a recent study that recommends Sweden should wait until its
economic stabilization programme and its labour market were better able to face
the asymmetric shocks of Emu membership. "I said these arguments against joining
Emu are also relevant in the long run," says Gottfries. "We should continue with
a floating exchange rate." But the consensus among the panel of Sweden's leading
economic academics, headed by professor Lars Calmfors of Stockholm University,
was that once Sweden has stabilized its economy, it should join Emu. They
concluded that there were political advantages in joining early, because Sweden
would have more influence in the EU in general.

<P> <B>Norway tracking at arm's length</B>

<P> Neighbouring Norway is preparing itself for life outside Emu, although its
strategy depends closely on what Sweden is doing. A central question is the
parity of the Norwegian krone. It was pegged to the Ecu, but it was floated in
December 1992 after the ERM had blown apart. There was a 20-month period during
which the krone operated under no clear guidelines. In May 1994 the king's
council approved a policy to peg the krone to "European currencies", which most
understand to mean a European basket close to the Ecu. From January 1999 there is
a question: should the krone be pegged to the euro, or to a new basket? "The euro
wouldn't reflect Norway's trading patterns, but wouldn't make a big difference,
considering that the ERM II countries will also follow the euro," says Jan
Qvigstad, chief economist at Norges Bank, the central bank. Norges Bank governor
Kjell Storvik warned on October 11: "Even though we have chosen to remain outside
the EU, we cannot allow Norway to become an "outsider" as regards economic
policy." But he discounted any fixed link with the euro or any plans for
coordinated intervention. "Whatever system Norway chooses," continued Storvik,
"Norway's monetary policy will be heavily influenced by the monetary policy
conducted by the future European Central Bank, even though there is not
necessarily a one-to-one relationship between Norwegian and European interest
rates in the short term." He pointed out one difference &#173; Norway's heavily
commodity-based and dollar-dependent export sector &#173; which means that
economic cycles and monetary policy would and should not be in lock-step with Emu
countries.

<P> <B>Aiming for a wide Target</B>

<P> Norway, Switzerland, Sweden and the UK want their major banks to be members
of Target, the planned pan-European payment system for the euro. Some countries
in the hard core of the Emu project want Target to operate only in Emu countries,
as Fedwire does in the US.

<P> But Norway's argument is that as a member of the European Economic Area, and
as part of the single market, it should have access to the single market's
payment system. It depends, says Jan Qvigstad, chief economist at Norges Bank,
whether the European Monetary Institute, which is designing Target, sees it
narrowly &#173; as a system to transmit monetary policy &#173; or more broadly
&#173; as a system to serve the single market. "We argue that &#173; in the
latter case &#173; if our companies want to make payments in euro, our banks
should have access to Target," says Quigstad.

<P> The Swiss National Bank's study notes: "If possible, Swiss franc-based
companies should not face higher transaction costs than those in the euro area,
because of the smaller size and greater competition in the Swiss franc market. A
precondition for Swiss banks to make efficient cross-border payments in euros
through the Swiss Interbank Clearing System is that the Swiss National Bank
should be a member of Target."

<P> <B>Japan's-eye view</B>

<P> Emu seems remote from Japan's major concerns, its own economy and the 78% of
its external trade that is done with Asia/Pacific countries. Readers confined to
the Japanese press won't learn much about the Emu debate in Europe, says Richard
Ku, chief economist at Nomura Securities: "Most people are very sceptical that
something like Emu can actually happen." Investors have mostly been avoiding the
European continent and looking at US treasuries and UK gilts, he says. But in the
last six months, and more intensively in the last few weeks, some investors have
been betting on convergence and debating hotly whether the euro will be strong or
weak.

<P> "Until six months ago," says Yamaichi's Shepperd, "the consensus in the US
and Japan was that it wouldn't happen. But now there is increasing concern about
how the euro will trade and the outlook for Europe post-Emu."

<P> Tending towards the strong euro belief "some Japanese are continuing to
invest on the basis that European rates are converging, and are increasing their
foreign bond holdings in Deutschmark and French francs, with some investment in
Italy and Spain", says Keith Edmunds, an economist at IBJ International in
London. The Japanese ministry of finance gives a breakdown of the country's
investment in major European currencies but not in Italy or Spain, which makes
volumes difficult to ascertain.

<P> To some banks in Japan the question of Emu is too remote to bother about.
"Just now, I don't have much idea," guffaws the chief economist of a major bank
in Tokyo. "I haven't really thought about it."

<P> <B>Asian focus</B>

<P> Singapore, Hong Kong and Beijing have given Emu more thought than Japan, says
Courtis at Deutsche Bank in Tokyo. He notes that Asians are broadly sceptical: in
general "they can't believe that sovereign governments will give up so much
economic power to a centre &#173; Brussels &#173; without a proper political
structure". But, as the possibility of Emu gets stronger, investors in those
Asian countries, such as Thailand and Singapore, whose currency is pegged to a
basket that includes the Deutschmark have quite a focused interest in the future
performance of the euro, he suggests.

<P> <B>Fear of failure</B>

<P> Outsiders, particularly in the US, worry that trouble is brewing between the
single-market concept and what might be an exclusive Emu club. "How stable
politically is variable geometry?" asks Eichengreen at Berkeley. The eventual
outcome for the UK, in the single market but outside Emu, might be to quit the
EU. On the other hand, "wait until sterling goes up to 1.80 or higher to the
dollar", says Courtis. "Maybe that will bring them running into Emu." Another
area of doubt is the Waigel stability pact and its future if either France or
Germany itself fails to meet the minimum criteria. Yet so much is now riding on
the inclusion of Spain and Italy in the first wave of Emu that there are bound to
be market repercussions if and when these countries finally fail to qualify.

<P> Bert Ely, consultant on central banking and monetary affairs in Virginia, US,
fears there are so many unresolved issues that, even if Emu happens, "it will
come unglued. My sense is it will be a very messy process."

<H3> EDITORIAL </H3>


<H2> <B>This time it's for real</B> </H2> 

<P> It is easy to be cynical about
Japan's professed keenness to liberalize its financial system.

<P> Recently <I>Euromoney</I> met the chief executive of one of the country's big
securities firms. He argued vehemently in favour of radical deregulation. But
when <I>Euromoney</I> asked whether he supported deregulation of fixed stock
commissions, he argued equally vehemently that this would be disastrous.

<P> All too often in Japan, policy changes such as this are decided purely on the
basis of which interest groups are able to exert influence &#173; rather than
what is best for the country. The securities industry, for example, has great
sway over the ministry of finance and therefore has been able to defeat attempts
to liberalize commissions for two decades.

<P> But last month new finance minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka announced a Big Bang
for the Japanese financial system &#173; including the freeing of commissions.

<P> This time it could happen. Although Mitsuzuka's proposals were sketchy, there
is a growing consensus in Japan that change &#173; and probably radical change
&#173; is inevitable.

<P> Taboos are being challenged for the first time. The most widely reported one
is the tentative plan to split up the ministry of finance, perhaps spinning off
an office of banking supervision. But no-one thinks this will do much to reduce
the power of the MoF. Indeed, many ministry officials believe that, on the
contrary, it will increase their power by creating a "colony" which they would
dominate.

<P> More potentially significant are the reforms of public institutions which are
under discussion. The financial activities of public bodies (from city
governments to bodies such as the Japan Development Bank) are minutely controlled
by central government. This has made them inefficient, and skewed the market.

<P> The key is what happens to post office savings. At present, the post office
pays above-market rates to its depositors; the funds are forcibly on-lent by the
MoF to public bodies. That has hampered the development of Japan's banks (and
forced them into risky businesses &#173; with well-known consequences) and
concentrated too much power in the hands of the MoF.

<P> Why are we surer that this time reforms will be implemented and will make a
difference? First, political consensus has swung behind this theme. All major
parties in last month's election supported administrative reform.

<P> There is a realization that Japan cannot go on as it is. The economy is
stagnating &#173; economists predict that long-term growth is unlikely to go
higher than 1 1/2%. The government is embarrassed that Japan's financial
institutions are so backward by international standards.

<P> But, most importantly, there are the first signs that some politicians are
beginning to think strategically about what system would be best for Japan &#173;
rather than merely mediating in the battle between interest groups.

<P> Can Japan silence the cynics who doubt that it can change? For the next few
months, events in Tokyo will be worth watching.

<H2> <B>Russia gets it right</B> </H2> <P> It is very easy to be cynical about
Russia too. Its economy and political system don't yet work like those of a
developed country. That makes it easy to poke fun at.

<P> But give Russia its due. When it came to the bond market for the first time
last month, its debut issue was probably the best ever by a sovereign borrower.
That was, to a large extent, due to the professional way the Russian government
handled the transaction; it also reflected the growing perception of investors
that Russia is on the path to steady economic development.

<P> When lead managers JP Morgan and SBC Warburg began final preparations for the
issue, it looked possible that the best the issuer could expect was a $500
million bond, with a maturity of only three years, and pricing at a humiliating
500 basis points over US treasuries. In the event, such was the excitement
generated by the transaction that the issue size was increased to $1 billion, the
tenor to five years and the pricing was 345bp over &#173; cheaper even than the
formal price-talk range.

<P> Syndicate managers say the Russian finance ministry did everything right. It
waited until after the presidential election and the publication of credit
ratings for the country, rather than rush ahead with the issue at the beginning
of the year. Officials soon learned the importance of sending the finance
minister on roadshows, despite initial reluctance.

<P> Improving economic fundamentals in Russia helped. Annual inflation is down to
6.5% (from 2,642% in 1992) and the rouble has been stable for months.

<P> The creation of a benchmark issue has its minuses too. It will be the chosen
vehicle for many investors to take a view on Russia. Want to know how Russia is
perceived? Just check the level of the 9 1/4 of 2001.

<H3> FRONT END </H3>



<H2> <B>Front End  </B> </H3> 

<B>Edited by Steven Irvine </B> <BR>

<H2> <B>The name's Lynch, Merrill Lynch </B> </H2> <P> Merrill Lynch's Euromarket
Christmas party in London this year had a James Bond flavour. Was Merrill trying
to say it had been shaken by Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's hiring spree this year,
but not stirred from its position at the top of the league table? Or was it just
giving its syndicate a licence to kill future defectors?

<P> The ThunderBond party, though lacking Martinis, tried to evoke the ambience
of the Bond milieu. Black ties were in evidence as was a casino, the British
secret agent's favourite way to woo women and humiliate his enemies.

<P> It was a winning formula. London syndicate supremo, David Tory, said his
group had worked hard to generate ideas to beat last year's party. This was held
in the Sega Centre, where guests played computer simulated head-to-head car races
around a track in Daytona.

<P> On this occasion cars &#173; Aston Martins of course &#173;  had to be left
at the door, along with overcoats, bugging devices and Walther PPKs. The Museum
of the Moving Image was the venue. Scenes of Roger Moore and Barbara Bach
cavorting around Egypt in <I>The Spy Who Loved Me</I> played on the screens.

<P> A disappointment for true Bond-fans was that the expected phalanx of James
Bond lookalikes was lacking. Only a version of arch-bad guy Jaws was present.
Jaws, who in one classic scene destroyed a small Citroen van with his bare hands
and his steel teeth, took a more low-key approach during the evening. The
lookalike's dentures were more often seen glinting by the bar, a beer bottle
their victim.

<P> The party stands out as a beacon of festive independence this year amidst a
new trend to pool resources. Other top houses opted to form a group and hire the
exclusive Oxo Tower on London's south bank. The so-called 'syndicated' party
included Morgan Stanley, SBC Warburg, CS First Boston and Salomon Brothers. All
were co-leads, but the top line went to Goldman Sachs. which was the organizer.

<P> On the night of the Merrill soiree news circulated of a fire at the Oxo
Tower. It turned out to be a false alarm &#173; the Oxo was closed for lunch but
open for dinner.

<P> But Bond is never happy to be upstaged. Perhaps he was up to his old game of
sabotage and subversion?&#009;<B>Steven Irvine</B>

<H2> <B>Talk to me like I'm just a kid </B> </H2> <P> When the television cameras
roved between the desks of UBS's bond trading floor, the traders grumbled at the
intrusion, then relaxed when they spotted that the alien accompanying Bob
Harding, head of debt bonds management, was a little girl. Warrior poses melted
as paternal instincts took over.

<P> Seven-year-old Shafika had been invited by UBS to interrogate Harding for new
UK television station Channel Five's planned weekend programme <I>The Mag</I>.
The interview will be shown in a regular 10 minute slot called 'Unique Species'
which aims to explain complex phenomena &#173; telephones, computers, rockets...
and bond trading &#173; to 8-14 year olds. It might also appeal to a more mature
audience. Shafika pretends to be a visitor from outer space and asks those basic,
first-principle questions that we'd like to ask, but now we're too old to dare.

<P> The programme will probably be shown next April, so it will be a few months
before Harding's nine- and 12-year-old children get the definitive answers to
questions such as "Why does the dentist live in Belgium?" and "Who would want a
zero-coupon bond?"
<B>Rupert Gordon-Walker</B>

<H2> <B>The X-files of the MoF revealed</B> </H2> <P> As if Japan's ministry of
finance (MoF) didn't have enough to worry about. A recent book &#173; <I>O-warai
Okurasho himitsu joho </I>(secret files of the ministry of finance) by television
comedian Terry Itoh &#173; pokes fun at its bureaucrats, and is a bestseller.

<P> It consists of three interviews with (anonymous) MoF officials. Itoh gets
them to talk openly about their motives for joining the ministry (power and
money), their opinion of politicians (stupid and easy to manipulate), and their
personal lives.

<P> One bureaucrat boasts that a MoF official "can understand and deal with in 10
minutes a document that any other bureaucrat would spend two nights reading and
still not grasp". The three are also obsessed with the fact that the 20 graduates
who join the MoF each year are so naturally brilliant that none ever had to study
particularly hard to enter Tokyo University's Law School (the alma mater of 95%
of them). MoF officials are also, they brag, excellent sportsmen and find it easy
to pick up women.

<P> Fact or fiction? Anyone who has had dealings with the  MoF may find it hard
to tell.

<H2> <B>Plucky Tuckey rises at Phoenix</B> </H2> <P> Phoenix Securities, the
British corporate finance boutique which specializes in advising its larger
financial services brethren, has always been something of a refugee camp for
executives fleeing the bureaucracy and politics of larger investment banks. Its
founding partners came together in the early 1980s, after quitting their previous
employers: John Craven and David Reid Scott from Merrill Lynch, Philip Seers from
CSFB, and Martin Smith from Bankers Trust.

<P> The firm's latest recruit is a refugee of a different kind: Andrew Tuckey,
former deputy chairman of the Baring Group which collapsed in February 1995.
Following Baring's rescue by ING, Tuckey immediately resigned but the bank's new
Dutch owners asked him to stay on for a year to smooth the transition. With that
assignment complete, one or two potential employers sounded him out, but there
was little prospect for Tuckey to return to a senior position at a large
investment bank.

<P> So why did Phoenix employ him as a consultant? What financial services client
of Phoenix would hunger for advice from the man who ran a bank which collapsed in
such spectacular fashion? Tuckey will not advise other banks &#173; the Phoenix
partners feel they have that sector well-covered. Their longest running problem
has been how to reduce their dependence on M&amp;A deals in just that sector.
They will use Tuckey's contacts and broad corporate finance experience to
diversify.

<P> His style certainly fits the firm's culture of old school tie and discreet
charm. But is Tuckey damaged goods? He was far removed from the Singapore trading
operations which caused Baring's collapse and has not been singled out for blame
by either of the key UK regulators investigating the affair: the Bank of England
and the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA). He did agree with the SFA in
March not to take a senior management position within an SFA-regulated firm in
the foreseeable future. Though he is only a consultant at Phoenix and has several
other outside directorships and trusteeships, he will be working for the firm
almost full time.

<B>Peter Lee</B>

<H2> <B>Birgit Breuel's Christmas present</B> </H2> <P> Alumni of the east German
privatization agency the Treuhandanstalt can relive those early days of
re-unification by playing a deeply corrupt board game launched last month &#173;
the Streuhandspiel. For one Streuhandthaler they can buy one of a selection of
crumbling, pollution-ridden east German companies, overmanned and loaded with old
debt: among them are Vesuv Werft AG, Mismut and Ego Blech. The trick is to con
the Streuhand into giving you more money, lie about the number of jobs you will
preserve, then renegotiate the contract terms until you come out ahead, even
though the firm goes bust and the workforce is laid off. Bribery, extortion,
blackmail, and threatening the other players with having to pay your debts if you
go bankrupt, are positively encouraged. So is the judicious use of old Stasi
documents. The Streuhand can choose between prosecution, reclaiming the property,
or letting you continue. It usually opts for the latter.

<P> All this is horribly familiar to Treuhand veterans. Scandals about how the
agency was conned of billions of Deutschmarks between 1990 and 1995 continue to
hit the press. The Treuhand's successor, the BvS, hasn't escaped scandal either.
The game's inventor, Guido Bombitzki, a 36-year-old Berlin lawyer who worked a
year at the Treuhand, says he has no axe to grind: "I left on good terms," he
says. Although his day job is commercial law, Bombitzki has thoughts of launching
another game in a couple of years "with an ethical slant, maybe the trade in
human organs". The Streuhandspiel, in a limited edition of 700, was made in
Poland and costs Dm120.

<P> An ideal Christmas present for former Treuhand president Birgit Breuel or any
of her erstwhile staff.

<B>David Shirreff</B>

<H2> <B>Whose ears are burning?</B> </H2> <P> European governments in the shadow
of Emu are getting especially tetchy about each other's sloppy financial
management.

<P> Bundesbank director, Edgar Meister pulled no punches in a speech in November
on the dangers of derivatives. "In one European country," he said, "we recently
saw the sheer scale of derivative losses that market movements can cause."
Meister mentioned that "active" management by the treasury of this country, using
currency swaps, mostly from underlying Deutschmark and Swiss franc bond issues
into "weaker currencies" between November 1989 and April 1992, had built up book
losses, which were then somewhat increased by currency options put on in an
attempt to mitigate the positions.

<P> "According to the latest information," said Meister, "the book losses on
these contracts amount to around Dm1.5 billion ($1 billion), and the potential
losses on contracts maturing between 1998 and 2002 are several billion
Deutschmarks."

<P> Meister didn't identify the country, but most of his audience at the
Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, knew very well it was Belgium.

<P> "Ladies and gentlemen," he continued, "losses on this scale are hardly a
thimbleful, even for a state budget, and they put a burden on the entire economy
and the individual taxpayer. The prudent and conservative use of these
instruments &#173; which I assume should go without saying &#173; was not
sufficient in this case."

<P> Kingdom of Belgium treasury officials are unchastened. "The report seems to
be exaggerated," says one. "We reported some unrealized losses on some very
specific derivatives transactions. If we unwound them today the loss would be
Bf32 billion ($1 billion) &#173; that would increase the cost of our debt by one
to two basis points. But we've reported this regularly and we answered questions
in parliament in October. It was mainly convergence trades in currency swaps. And
we sold currency options, including options on the dollar." The official wouldn't
mention specific trades, "but we do publish the composition of our debt after
swaps", he said. He pointed to the substantial movements seen in currency swaps.
The maximum loss of Bf32 billion could improve before 2002 when the last trades
unwind. There was no admission of imprudence, he said but, because the context
has changed since 1992 and 1993, "we have stopped buying and selling options".

<H3> MARKET MONITOR </H3>



<BR> <B>Edited by Peter Lee </B>

<H4> <B>MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES</B> </H4> <H2> <B>Play it, SAM</B> </H2> <P>
Fancy a bond secured on a zero-interest, interest-only, life-long loan? With the
Bank of Scotland, you can now borrow 25% of the value of your house and not repay
a penny for the rest of your life. SBC Warburg is securitizing the mortgage and
foretells this brand-new market will soon be worth hundreds of billions of
dollars worldwide.

<P> The shared appreciation mortgage (SAM) has just been launched by the Bank of
Scotland, fully refinanced by SBC Warburg in advance of a securitization in the
first quarter of 1997. But how interested will investors be in the securitization
of an asset with no track record &#173; because it has not existed before.

<P> The concept is simple: the homeowner pays zero or low interest; the bank, in
return, gets participation in any increase in the value of the house when it is
sold. In the case of the zero-interest SAM, as opposed to a low-interest SAM, the
bank sees a return on the original loan of three times the increase in house
values. So if Bank of Scotland lends a homeowner 25% of the value of a property,
it will receive 75% of any increase in value when the home is sold, plus the
original 25% loan. If the homeowner pays 5.75% interest, then the 3:1 ratio
reduces to 1:1. A mortgagee might borrow 65% of the value of a property and pay
5.75% interest on that for life.

<P> When the property is sold, the Bank of Scotland gets 65% of the increase in
value along with its loan back. In short, the homeowner, as well as issuing debt,
issues equity.

<P> This is the kind of risk which investors might well be happy with, but which
no bank would like to see on its balance sheet. So SBC Warburg is securitizing
it.

<P> Craig Corn, director of global residential property markets at SBC Warburg,
has been working on this project for the past two years. He brought in Bank of
Scotland about a year ago. He's evangelical about the benefits of the SAM. "For
most people," he says, "the future value of their houses is not at the front of
their mind. What they need is cash flow. People need money to top up their
pensions, to pay school fees, or something less financially responsible, like
going on a cruise. At the moment, 80% of most homeowners' portfolios is house:
they really ought to diversify, especially given that historically equities have
performed much better than house prices."

<P> Corn is banking on there being a lot of investors who want direct exposure to
the retail property market. They've never been able to have this before, having
to rely on substitutes such as equity in construction companies. Pension funds
should be interested, because historically house prices have not only
outperformed inflation, but matched increases in earnings; most pension fund
liabilities are earnings-linked. Property funds should certainly be interested.
And there's enough equity in the bonds to encourage some equity investors as
well, although the mortgages are being sold on the basis that stock markets have
historically outperformed house prices.

<P> Corn claims that the structure of the mortgage has been carefully designed to
encourage holders to make improvements to their house and to maximize its value.
And they won't be able to buy high and sell low, doing sweetheart deals on the
side, because the repayment amount is based on valuations and not capital gains.
The equity participation is based on the difference between two prices: the lower
of the buying price and the value of the property when the mortgage is taken out,
and the value of the property when the mortgage is paid off. From this figure is
subtracted any increase in value directly attributable to improvements made by
the homeowner after taking out the mortgage.

<P> The SAM has been designed as a remortgaging vehicle, rather than a
house-buying instrument. It is aimed especially at pensioners, who may want a
higher income but are not so interested in capital gains on their home on their
death.

<P> The 5.75% SAMs will be securitized into fixed-rate notes with a coupon of
about 55% of the 10-year gilt yield; the zero-interest SAMs will be securitized
into floating-rate notes with a coupon of about 60% of three-month Libor. Both
will then pay a quarterly coupon of all the income from the mortgages that
quarter, both capital repayment and shared appreciation. The maturities will be
more than 50 years, although SBC Warburg will be able to "sweep up" outstanding
bonds when 80% of the underlying assets are sold.

<P> The reason that the zero-interest SAMs can pay floating-rate is that, by the
time they are securitized, they will have been deleveraged. Sixty per cent of the
price of the bond is invested in Libor-yielding securities, thus accounting
directly for the coupon. This doesn't add anything to the bond: it makes it look
a little more like the securities investors already know.

<P> But it isn't like anything the capital markets have seen before. "It's a
convertible bond wrapped up in a securitization vehicle," says Corn, who does
find it difficult finding a useful analogy. "It's a property-linked bond." "It's
an equity securitization." "It's a mortgage-backed security." "It's equity in
retail housing." "If I had to pick one bond which it was like, I'd say it was
most like an index-linked gilt, linked to house prices instead of inflation."

<P> In fact, it's a curious hybrid. The underlying assets are a combination of
debt (the original loan) and equity (the shared appreciation). If this market
takes off, it's inevitable that the equity will be stripped out and traded
separately; at the beginning, however, the two come together. The Bank of
Scotland is taking no interest at all in its loans: 100% of the debt and equity
from them goes to bondholders, with the Bank of Scotland receiving only a fee.

<P> Trying to value the debt part of the bonds alone will be horrendously
difficult. It's secured on lifetime interest-only loans which have never been
issued before, so there's no data on when the sort of people who take out these
loans either sell or die, or how good their credit is.

<P> With typical mortgage-backed securities, the danger is prepayment of loans;
here, it's more likely to be the opposite. Furthermore, says Corn, "the
prepayment rate is very different from normal prepayment rates. Normally, it's
driven by interest rates. Here, it's driven by home turnover."

<P> But if trying to value a zero-coupon bond when you don't know the maturity
date is difficult, then trying to come up with a vaguely scientific method for
predicting future house price rises is even harder. "The value of the bonds is
the value of any appreciation in house prices plus the net present value of any
future appreciation," explains Corn. "The pricing is a trade-off between interest
rates, house prices, actuarial calculations and other factors. But the main
factor driving the market price of these securities will be what investors think
house prices are going to do in the future." He predicts a rosy future for
housing analysts with experience of the hitherto largely useless art of working
out what drives retail property prices.

<P> The initial pricing will be based largely on SBC Warburg research, because
few investors will be able to price the bonds themselves. This research will
depend on a detailed breakdown from Bank of Scotland of who has bought the
mortgages. The fixed income and equity desks at SBC Warburg will sell the
securities. Eventually, however, the bonds will be traded more like equity, on
price/earnings and debt/equity ratios.

<P> SBC Warburg promises to make a market in its bonds, although they won't be
actively traded at first &#173; Corn likens them to illiquid corporate debentures
in this respect. He's confident, however, that the market will become very large
very quickly. "Look at the UK alone," he says. "There's &#163;1.2 trillion ($2
trillion) of property value, of which &#163;800 billion is net wealth." Once SBC
Warburg has started to tap this resource, other banks will want to get in on the
act.

<P> To do so, however, will require sophisticated risk management systems and a
lot of capital. The mortgages have to be refinanced by the bank before they are
securitized. At the moment, SBC Warburg is refinancing up to &#163;100 million of
very peculiar Bank of Scotland mortgages (&#163;150 million to &#163;200 million
of bonds after deleveraging) with no guarantee that it will ever be able to shift
them off balance-sheet.

<P> But Corn is convinced that this will be a huge part of the international
capital markets, from Europe to Asia and even the US, where the domestic housing
market is worth $11 trillion. He foresees people being able to buy houses worth a
higher multiple of earnings, because it's not the amount of debt that lenders are
worried about so much as the level of repayments.<B>Felix Salmon </B>

<H4> <B>CORPORATE BONDS</B> </H4> <H2> <B>Putting on a natural hedge</B> </H2>
<P> The surge in investment-grade corporate puttable bonds this year, which
Securities Data estimates totalled nearly $15 billion at the end of November, up
from $8.9 billion last year, is being driven by investors who've turned to
puttable bonds as the hedge of choice for their unpredictable mortgage-backed
securities portfolios. That is providing bond issuers with the means to cut their
funding costs through various put structures.

<P> Big investors, including for the first time insurance companies, are turning
to puttable bonds to reduce the negative convexity in their fixed income
portfolios.

<P> Greg Hopper, a portfolio manager for Bankers Trust Global Investment
Management, explains: "If you bought something that has an embedded call option
in it, like a callable corporate or a mortgage bond, where the underlying
mortgages can prepay, what will happen is that as the market rallies the bond has
a higher chance of being prepaid," says Hopper. "The bond will not keep up with
the rally. Then as the market declines, he notes, "there is less likelihood of it
being prepaid so it will go down much more quickly." In other words, callable
bonds may offer a higher yield but they underperform straight bonds in a bull
market and perform even worse in a falling market.

<P> The traditional remedy for this problem is what's called a delta hedge. That
requires buying treasuries as the market goes up to maintain the overall duration
of the portfolio. Duration, a combination of an issue's maturity and coupon, is a
measure of the sensitivity of a bond's price to movements in interest rates.

<P> In practice, delta hedging can be difficult and expensive particularly in the
choppy and volatile markets of recent years. If the market rallies by half a
point, and an investor<B> </B>buys the treasuries, but then the market declines,
"then you bought at the top and are losing money on the hedge", says one
investor.

<P> Puttable bonds, on the other hand, are "sort of a natural delta hedge,"
claims Hopper. If an investor buys a 30-year bond, with the right to put it in 10
years, it will cost only about 20 more basis points than a 10-year bond. Some
yield is sacrificed. But if interest rates start falling, the puttable bond will
rise in value, extending the portfolio's duration. "The whole problem of duration
has become such a hot topic and so important to portfolio managers over the past
few years, that they've discovered this tool," Hopper says.

<P> In the past embedded options have been undervalued. And since market
volatilities have been higher than the assumptions on which the puts have been
priced, "buyers are getting a better deal than the issuers", argues Salomon
Brothers bond strategist Dennis Adler.

<P> Adler notes that historically high levels of puttable bond issuance have
occurred during periods of low interest rates and flat yield curves. In such an
environment, if rates go up, the bond will be put. In the case of, say, a 30-year
bond with a 10-year put, the issuer will have got, say, 10-year money, for 20
basis points less than if he had issued a straight 10-year bond.

<P> In the past, the lower yields associated with puttable bonds have been
anathema for many investors, particularly the insurers. "Two or three years ago,
they would not have wanted to give up the yield. It's a sea change of thinking
for them," says Adler. Much of the new interest in puttable bonds has been
foisted on the insurers, however. It is driven by a capital charge the rating
agency Standard &amp; Poor's began calculating in early 1995 when assessing the
creditworthiness of life insurance companies. "The reason there's a demand for
puttable bonds is because of S&amp;P's convexity test. It only started after we
said 'look what's going on here'," says Patricia McWeeney, the director of
insurance rating services. "When you see what the numbers look like, it makes
sense to hedge it." S&amp;P's methodology attempted to extract the option risk in
the mortgage-backed securities by stressing interest rates and comparing them to
single-A non-callable corporates under the same conditions.

<P> Life insurers are snapping up the puts to help cover the inherest risk of
their mortgage-backed securities. Their aggregate investment in those securities
amounted to over $273 billion at the end of 1994, according to S&amp;P. With the
outstanding puts at about $30 billion, estimates Adler, there's plenty of room
for more puttable bond issuance.

<P> Insurers started buying the mortgage-backed securities in the early 1990s,
after being stung by the credit risks associated with the real estate downturn
and a deterioration in the credit of high-yield bonds. At that time, insurance
companies were being forced by regulators to capitalize their credit risk only,
not the interest risk, making the securities attractive investments.

<P> Before the mortgage-backed securities market meltdown in 1994, many insurers
had about 50% of their portfolio in mortgage-backed securities. Today the
percentage is between 15-25%, with the largest firms having a higher percentage,
estimates S&amp;P.

<P> The 1994-95 markets hurt the performance of insurers' portfolios, says
McWeeney. During 1994, interest rates rose dramatically, causing the securities
to underperform. "During 1994, insurers were losing 2-10% on the mortgage-backed
securities relative to corporates," she says. The following year, rates rose,
creating a surge of prepayments. "The numbers were larger than people expected."
Holders of callables were hit hard by negative convexity.

<P> This year has been relatively calm. But with the 10-year treasuries below
6.25%, that could trigger a surge of refinancings by homeowners who bought their
homes some time during the past two years, says John Nolan, portfolio manager for
Bankers Trust Global Investment Management.

<P> Puttable bonds have been particularly useful for portfolio managers who don't
want to sell the mortgage-backed securities they may be holding, particularly if
it would mean booking a loss. Moreover, when puttable bonds are designed to be a
mirror image of what a mortgage security does, "you can create something like a
traditional bond with a lot more yield," says Nolan.

<P> While the puts themselves have a lower yield than a regular bond would, when
combined with another security, that's not the case. He says the combined yield
might be 20-40 basis points higher than a traditional bond. "The pitch has been
that there's value there," says Nolan, adding that's because "there's some risk
because there's not an exact fit between the two."

<P> Nolan notes that a lot of mortgage securities act like a three-year security
in a rally, and a 10-year one when rates rise, he says. If such a security was
paired with a 10-year bond with a put at three years, the combination of the two
would offset each other. However, most puts aren't designed that way. The most
popular this year has been a 30-year bond with a 10-year put, although bankers
are coming up with a variety of structures that might prove more useful to
investors.

<P> The most interesting are "step-ups," in which the coupon is increased if not
put, or multiple-year puttable bonds. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's 30-year bond for
the Province of Quebec, which is puttable every year after 10 years, or Morgan
Stanley's Tennessee Valley Authority bond, which matures in 2036, but is puttable
at years two and 10 &#173; the so-called put-put bond &#173; are the types of
structures investors are clamouring for.

<H4> <B>EURO COMMERCIAL PAPER</B> </H4> <H2> <B>Back from the dead</B> </H2> <P>
Euro commercial paper (ECP) always seems to get a raw deal. It's forever regarded
as the poor relation of its American cousin, and is only known for the withdrawal
from the market of several major banks at the turn of the 1990s, and its very
tight margins. These usually represent no more than two or three basis points of
a deal.

<P> Two more banks left the ECP market this year: Chase started to pull out at
the time of the merger with Chemical in March, and Bank of America pulled out
over the summer. While this might appear to bode ill for the market, the
remaining banks are hopeful that it will help to alleviate chronic overbroking:
"We're not looking for a cartel," said one dealer. "But we do want the market to
be as economical as possible."

<P> This year has seen other developments to encourage the remaining
participants. The latest figures released by Euroclear show ECP outstandings for
the first 10 months of 1996 at $106 billion: not a large amount compared to the
US market which has $750 billion outstanding, but it does represent an increase
of 18% over 1995. It has moved the market away from the stasis of $80 billion
which had dogged it since 1991.

<P> There is also an impression of shortage of supply. Pieter van Dyck, director
and product manager of ECP and EMTNs at SBC Warburg, widely regarded as the ECP
market leader, estimates this could be as much as $100 billion, although the
present excess demand is limited to certain high-grade names.

<P> Those banks still active in ECP maintain they have a strategic commitment to
what they regard as an essential part of the capital markets. "Any house that is
serious about offering a comprehensive service to its customers must have a
strong ECP desk," says Warburg's van Dyck, . "The ECP market offers such a
diversity of short-term product that all investors with significant cash balances
want to be in it. Also, in respect of mergers and acquisitions, ECP is
increasingly becoming part of the scene, so how can you act as an M&amp;A adviser
if you don't have an ECP desk?"

<P> One reason for the increase in outstanding paper is the expansion in the
number of issuing currencies over the past four years. The main change has been
the loss in market share of dollar-denominated paper in favour of European
currencies, especially the Deutschmark and sterling. The dollar share has
declined to 55% this year from 84% in 1992, according to SBC Warburg.
Non-European currencies have also grown in importance, especially the Australian
dollar, the yen, and the Korean won, which is seen as relatively low risk since
Korea was granted OECD associate status. Most of the main ECP houses expect
issues in other Asian currencies such as the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit
to become more frequent as investors begin to search for paper yielding more than
the traditional currencies.

<P> The diversity of currencies has led to a deeper ECP market: up to 50% of the
market is now based on synthetic ECP, allowing participants to arbitrage spot and
forward foreign exchange.

<P> ECP is also becoming a more competitive and attractive source of funding.
Dominic Surry, executive director and head of CP and FRNs at Lehman, mentions one
aspect: "This year we have seen increasing demand from central banks for ECP as
new sovereign programmes have come on line and comparable investments have become
less attractive. The huge net redemptions and increasingly tight spreads,
relative to Libor, in the floating rate note market are a major factor
contributing to this trend."

<P> Commercial paper should also benefit from the growth of the repo market:
"With the Bank of England making the repo market its intervention tool of choice,
the importance of eligible bills will probably be reduced," says Jonathan Boyd,
head of money markets and repo at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG). "So bank
appetite for holding them, especially bills of acceptance, will drop and they
will not be such a cheap source of funding for corporates. Commercial paper would
be the ideal alternative."

<H3> DEAL INSIDER </H3>


<BR>BRIAN CAPLEN</B> 

<H2> <B>Will investors enjoy the Concert?</B> </H2> 

<P> <B>M&amp;A players: British Telecom and MCI Communications</B>

<P> <B>Value: $20 billion</B>

<P> <B>Announced: November 3</B>

<P> <B>Investment bankers: Lazard Brothers,</B>

<P> <B>NM Rothschild, Morgan Stanley</B>

<P> British Telecom has publicized its proposed merger with MCI Communications of
the US as an exercise in lowering overheads and increasing global reach. But
large numbers of shareholders may not wish to wait for the benefits to come
through.

<P> A wave of post-merger selling is expected, especially from former MCI
shareholders who have no interest in owning a foreign utility they consider only
a rung up from a nationalized industry. The new company Concert will not appear
in US indices, such as the S&amp;P 500, giving US institutions another reason not
to hold the stock.

The prospect of a US shareholder backlash was what made
MCI's investment banker Lazard Brothers push for a share buyback of up to 10%,
something BT through its advisors NM Rothschild &amp; Sons wanted to avoid. It
was the major sticking point in intense negotiations between the companies that
almost came to grief on several occasions. The other key issues were a dividend
payment to BT shareholders that MCI shareholders will not receive; and the size
of the cash portion of the offer made for MCI stock. BT is offering 5.4 of its
own shares plus $6 in cash for each MCI share.

<P> Says an investment banker in New York: "One of the critical elements of any
deal &#173; which had to be mostly a stock deal because of the size of it &#173;
was that it had to take account of a fair amount of shifting among the
shareholder base of the companies. There needed to be enough buyer support from
BT after the merger to rebuild the shareholder base. Many US institutions would
want to get out and a significant buyback after the merger was a <I>sine qua
non</I>."

<P> BT thought a buyback wasn't necessary and that the cash component of the bid
was a sufficient reward for MCI stockholders. On this aspect of the bid MCI won
out.

<P> BT's relationship with MCI goes back to June 1993 when it announced plans to
invest $4.3 billion for a 20% stake in MCI, a deal that was firmed up the
following March. Later in 1994 joint global services were launched under the name
Concert.

<P> Then, in the summer of this year, senior executives of both companies &#173;
BT's chairman Sir Iain Vallance; its chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield; MCI's
chairman and CEO Bert Roberts and its president and chief operating officer
Gerald Taylor &#173; began serious discussions on the advantages of a full
merger. Further deregulation of the $100 billion US telecoms market will allow
MCI, a long-distance carrier, to compete there while a more integrated European
market will provide further opportunities. By combining their strengths, the
companies would be better able to exploit these and other markets, calculated
their senior executives.

<P> With this end in mind, BT and MCI instructed their investment bank advisers
to negotiate a merger. While the companies clearly know each other well,
conducting negotiations through third parties was vitally important &#173; that
way, if the deal fell apart, working relationships would not be jeopardized. As
well as Lazard and Rotshchild, Morgan Stanley was hired by BT to advise on
reactions to the deal among shareholders.

From the viewpoint of MCI shareholders, the aim was to get
the best possible price for their stock but not one so high it destroyed the
value of the Concert paper they would end up holding. "We had to get the right
value for our shareholders but not so much value that the quality of the paper
was undermined," says John Nelson, vice-chairman of Lazard Brothers in London.
"If you had a deal that diluted the value of BT paper, you would be doing a deal
against yourself."

<P> The final offer price valued MCI at $39 a share (at the prevailing exchange
and share prices following the deal's announcement in early November), and meant
that BT would end up paying $20 billion in shares and cash for the final 80% of
MCI. The $6 cash per share will result in a total cash payment of &#163;2.3
billion ($3.8 billion) if the merger, which is subject to US regulatory approval,
goes through.

This is similar in value to the &#163;2.2 billion that
will be paid as a special dividend to BT stockholders regardless of whether the
deal goes ahead or not. While investment bankers insist this is a coincidence,
analysts argue that the companies are offering sweeteners to shareholders to
ensure the deal's completion.

<P> "The discretionary share buyback and the special dividend are sweeteners to
shareholders and are sufficient compensation for near-term earnings dilution,"
says Paul Norris, European telecoms analyst with Lehman Brothers. "We are
extremely positive on the deal from an industry perspective. We think Concert
will turn out as one global mean machine."

<P> The determination of senior executives not to have their plans derailed is
shown by the poison pill of $450 million that either company cancelling the deal
must pay to the other. This is to prevent another suitor coming in and spoiling
the agreement. The special dividend will also shore up the value of BT paper as
the currency of the deal.

<P> But while management is gung-ho, the challenge for bankers has been to keep
investors in two very different stocks happy as bedfellows. MCI is a growth stock
with high gearing and low dividends of just five cents a share last year. BT, by
contrast, is a conservative company with net debt equal to 8% of equity and
paying out high dividends.

<P> Will the resulting Concert with 65% gearing satisfy anybody or nobody? The
likelihood of dissent among US shareholders led to the creation of the buyback
facility, but will UK shareholders be any happier? Given the enlarged position
that Concert will hold in UK indices, some UK institutions will be obliged to buy
for the same reason their US colleagues will sell. But with their special
dividends in hand and the prospect of future dividends below earnings growth,
many shareholders may decide to quit. As well as building global networks,
Concert may have to spend time rebuilding its shareholder base.

<H3> EMERGING MARKETS </H3>


<BR> <B>Edited by Brian Caplen</B>

<H4> <B>TURKEY</B> </H4> 
<H2> <B>Regulator reaches compromise </B> </H2> 

<P> On
November 7, after seven days out in the cold, three UK brokerage firms were
told by the Capital Markets Board (CMB) in Ankara that they could resume dealing
in Turkish securities. They had been suspended for refusing to sign a letter
agreeing to divulge client names directly to the CMB.

<P> CMB chief Ali Ihsan Karacan ended up admitting that his behaviour may have
been "unusually brusque". But he got his way. The firms have now signed a revised
letter, but they don't regard the situation as satisfactory &#173; they feel they
can now deal only for their own account or for clients who agree that their names
may be given to the CMB.

<P> As reported in last month's <I>Euromoney</I>, on October 21 the CMB gathered
all Turkish brokers dealing with foreign brokerage houses and issued them with an
ultimatum: the CMB was conducting an investigation into transactions executed
between May 1 and September 30 by non-resident banks and brokerage houses
operating through Turkish intermediaries in shares of national carrier Turkish
Airlines (THY). It said that non-resident banks and brokerage houses must give
the CMB a list of their clients involved in these transactions. Institutions
based in Turkey would be held responsible. They had one week to comply.

<P> On October 28 the CMB announced that Kleinwort Benson, SBC Warburg and
Caspian Securities had refused to give the required information and would be
suspended from dealing in Turkey's capital market directly and indirectly until
they complied.

<P> Shares in THY had risen from about TL6,000 at the beginning of the year to
TL50,000 in June but it was not just this that prompted the CMB to act. Between
80% and 90% of the trades in THY stock had been orders from foreign entities. The
CMB suspected that these foreign entities were Turkish manipulators executing
their orders through overseas brokers to escape detection.

<P> In May, when THY shares were around TL20,000, the government's Privatization
Administration (PA) had informed brokers that it was planning to sell some THY
shares in its portfolio at market prices. A block of shares was purchased by
Global Securities, the country's largest broker. Shares in THY started to climb
to TL50,000. Both Global and the PA deny there was foul play.

<P> The CMB's first reaction, as director Karacan himself admitted later, was
unusually brusque &#173; and arguably devoid of any legal basis. It said
henceforth that foreign brokers must reveal the names of their end clients in
every transaction. The brokers were unanimous in their opposition to this
requirement, which would have constituted a gross violation of client
confidentiality. Wishing to get to the bottom of the THY debacle, the CMB then
asked the brokers to supply the names of their end clients in transactions
involving the airline.

<P> Requests were put to 11 institutions, according to the CMB: Caspian, Bank
Leu, Bear Stearns International, Citicorp International Securities, Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette (DLJ), ING Baring Securities, Merrill Lynch Equities,
Kleinwort Benson Securities, SBC Warburg, Salzburg M&uuml;nchen Bank and Salomon
Brothers International.

<P> The institutions responded in different ways. On October 4, Kathy Cates and
Abigail Harvey from the London offices of SBC Warburg wrote to the CMB declining
to reveal the names of their clients, a source said.

<P> Citicorp International Securities, which opened its doors in Istanbul earlier
this year, had no problem complying with the CMB's request. Nearly 90% of
Citicorp's clients are non-Turks and the conservative company is very careful
about who it deals with. "We have turned away a number of Turkish citizens who
came with huge sums of money whom we could not identify as bona fide
businessmen," says a Citicorp source.

<P> ING Baring told the CMB it would not comply with the directive concerning
notification of end clients in every transaction but proposed an alternative. It
would reveal the names of clients who dealt in THY shares only if they agreed to
it. (In the event they all did, says a Baring source. Had they not, Baring would
not have revealed them, arguing that it need not obey a retroactive CMB ruling.)

<P> SBC Warburg informed the CMB that it might obtain the information it sought
if it approached them via the UK regulator, the Securities and Futures Authority
(SFA). The reactions of Caspian and Kleinwort Benson were similar.

<P> The response of the CMB was to suspend these three firms. Hasty talks between
the UK treasury, the SFA and Turkish officials helped to defuse the situation and
a compromise was found.

<P> Other major UK institutions were indignant at the implication that they might
be dealing for money-launderers or manipulators. "We have to go through serious
money-laundering checks," says a Turkish dealer at a big UK bank, "and our
clients would have to submit two years of audited accounts."

<P> But most firms have now agreed to sign a revised undertaking, given to
Turkish brokers and banks, which agrees to supply the CMB with information on the
identity of end clients in any future investigation the CMB might feel it
necessary to open. Without this undertaking from a foreign entity the Turkish
broker or bank cannot deal with it. The wording is as follows :

<P> "We hereby undertake to provide the CMB with information on the identity of
end clients on whose behalf we place orders and other information and documents
associated with their transactions which we will execute through your corporation
when required by the CMB."

<P> A Caspian source comments: "In retrospect people seem to think our refusal
was a good thing." Citibank says that all but one of its customers had signed the
undertaking. The reaction of some brokers has been to say that they will do only
proprietary trading in Turkey. But they reflect that the situation is no worse
than the mandatory name give-up in Brazil.

<P> It's not known how many UK entities have signed the undertaking. "It's still
not a satisfactory solution," says Peter Beales, a director of the London
Investment Banking Association. "It's a stop-gap but not a good long-term
framework, and it's preventing firms from doing business in
Turkey."<B>&#009;Metin M&uuml;nir</B>

<H4> <B>ST PETERSBURG</B> </H4> <H2> <B>Eighty years on</B> </H2> <P> With the
political stormy season over, St Petersburg is gearing up to enter the
international financial world on the heels of the federal government. City
officials are ready to apply for an international credit rating, one of the final
steps in the process that could make it the first Russian city to float its own
securities on the world market since 1917. The $200 million-$300 million planned
issue is slated to begin in early 1997.

<P> Aside from the prestige, the city is looking to cover its yawning budget
deficit. City governor Vladimir Yakovlev, elected in June, managed to submit a
balanced budget to the city council in October. This marked the first time in
recent years that a budget has been drawn up before the start of the fiscal year.
The balance, however, calls for R1.89 trillion ($378 million) in municipal bond
issues to cover the expected 17% budget deficit. Potential revenues from
Eurobonds were not included in the budget. "We tried to take the most pessimistic
scenario," says finance committee chairman Igor Artyemyev. As before, bond
revenues will be funnelled into restoring and maintaining the city's public
works, which need desperate attention.

<P> There is also an element of pride at stake. Moscow's city legislature just
gave its stamp of approval to local officials to go ahead with plans for a
Eurobond issue of its own. As the former financial centre of tsarist Russia, St
Petersburg is not likely to let a rare opportunity to snub its current big
brother slip through its fingers. With Russia already in the market and
Kazakhstan on the way, the two capital cities would round out the latest growing
sector in international financial markets.

<P> Whether French investors will put aside their anger over losses in tsarist
and municipal bonds cancelled by the Bolsheviks in 1919 is another story. The
recent announcement by prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin that Russia would pay
$400 million to compensate French bondholders was described by bondholders'
associations as little more than a "down payment". France has banned trading in
Russia's $1 billion Eurobond until the question of compensation is sorted out.

<P> By all accounts, this past year has been a roller-coaster ride for St
Petersburg's municipal bond programme, considered one of the most successful muni
issues in the country. The city currently offers short-term bonds (MKOs) for
serious investors and savings bonds for the average Sidirovs, Ivanovs and
Smirnovs unable to handle high dealer costs and commissions. Political
uncertainty drove yields on MKOs to 140% last spring, well above the 100%
refinancing rate offered by the central bank. Suddenly, what the city had touted
as a less expensive resource than bank loans was forcing officials to dig deeper
into their pockets when bondholders came to collect. According to some estimates,
revenues from new bond sales during the first half of 1996 went in their entirety
to paying off maturing issues.

<P> Political typhoons swirled around the bonds with even greater fury after
Yakovlev defeated former mayor Anatoly Sobchak at the polls. Given Yakovlev's
commitment to focus on local issues, a number of local financial experts took his
election as a death knell for Eurobond hopes. Alexei Kudrin, creator of the
short-term municipal bond programme and one of Sobchak's closest advisers, soon
departed for Moscow when his mentor, Anatoly Chubais, now chief of staff to
president Boris Yeltsin, offered him the position of deputy. In the meantime, the
new administration sharply criticized the level of debt &#173; R4 trillion &#173;
facing the city. A few whispers of "pyramid" began circulating around the local
and national media, suggesting that the bonds were about to plunge the city into
bankruptcy.

<P> Now that the dust from the post-election fray has settled,  Yakovlev and his
new economic team have thrown their support behind the bonds, muni and Euro
alike. "Today it is becoming completely realistic, even though just yesterday it
seemed almost impossible," Artyemyev says. Officials are still quiet about
current revenues, but yields have since levelled off at roughly 70%.

<P> Another 3,000 small investors, including a large proportion of pensioners,
have bought city savings bonds at a nominal price of R100,000. Yields are
currently 65%. "Nowhere else in Russia is there such a profitable instrument
accessible to average investors," says Alexander Rodshtein of the St Petersburg
Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

<P> Buoyed by the relative success of the MKO programme, officials are hoping the
Eurobond issue will receive an equally warm welcome. However, selling St
Petersburg abroad is going to be a challenge.

<P> "On the surface, St Petersburg is a very well known city with great
international name recognition. It could be successful," says Richard Deitz,
managing director of Renaissance Capital in Moscow. "But officials will have to
explain the prospects for the city and its future." Turning the city's prospects
around, particularly its large share of the military-industrial complex, is
Yakovlev's next assignment.

<H4> <B>HUNGARY</B> </H4> 
<H2> <B>Raincoat after the storm</B> </H2> 
<P> Arpad
Kovacs could make some money betting against his own survival. He became the
chairman of the board of the Hungarian Privatization and Holding Company (APV) in
October. The 48-year-old took the place of Imre Szokai, who had been sacked for
rewarding one Marta Tocsik with $5.2 million for nine months of consulting work.

<P> In theory, the cash was simply a fee for helping APV reach settlements on the
value of contested assets; for every forint paid Tocsik, the government saved 15.
But news of the arrangement provoked a mammoth public outcry when it was leaked
to the press in late September. Hungarians are famously cynical, but this was too
much. Tocsik's nine-month windfall was roughly 1,500 times the average
Hungarian's annual salary.

<P> At first it looked as though the deal was simply a pay-off; then the
arrangement was rumoured to be a covert funding pipeline to political parties.

<P> Beyond Szokai, the Tocsik explosion left other gaps in the government's
ranks: the rest of the APV's 11-member board fell, as did the man ultimately in
charge of privatization, minister of industry and trade Tamas Suchman. Even
Socialist prime minister Gyula Horn teetered after he briefly made the mistake of
backing Suchman against the massed will of the Socialist MPs.

<P> So the odds are against Kovacs and the other men and women newly appointed to
run the APV; the electorate will have little patience with slip-ups. Asked how
long he expects to last in the new post, Kovacs jokes: "There have been a number
of bets made about that. If I wanted to make a little money, I'd fix with the
gamblers how long I'll stay."

<P> Although Kovacs predicts he'll make it until the next parliamentary elections
(slated for May 1998), he says some wager he won't survive three months.

<P> In Kovacs, Horn reached for the safest possible candidate. Making Kovacs
chairman of the APV's board was like hiring a vegetarian to run the butcher shop.
Since 1990, Kovacs has worked at the State Audit Office, where he made a name for
himself criticizing successive privatization authorities' inflated salaries,
inordinate secrecy, and an over-reliance on consultants. Kovacs' CV is just the
whitest of a stack pulled out to paper over the Tocsik scandal. Party stalwarts
are out, "experts" are in. Judit Csiha, a 46-year-old former public prosecutor
and corporate lawyer, was named to be minister responsible for privatization, the
post Suchman held before becoming minister of industry and trade.

<P> Beyond personalities, the Tocsik scandal has provoked a broad move to revise
privatization procedures to ensure clean dealing. According to one set of
proposals put forward by Csiha, the APV's board will no longer be able to cancel
tenders after one valid bid has been received. Also, tender requirements cannot
be altered after a tender is issued. To increase accountability, comprehensive
records will be kept of APV decisions and staff recommendations. While the APV
has been run as an autonomous company with no direct reporting responsibility to
parliament, the company will now be accountable to a 19-member parliamentary
oversight committee.

<P> Immaculate credentials aside, Kovacs and company seem to be more an insurance
policy against future privatization embarrassments than a broom to sweep out the
APV's dark closets. Once the privatizers' fiercest watchdog, Kovacs now says he
won't be hunting for skeletons from his new post.

<P> "There are six groups and agencies investigating the APV, so it would be
redundant for me to do that also," he told <I>Euromoney</I> recently.

<P> Kovacs is also taking a hands-off approach to another persistent problem at
the APV: patronage. Critics charge that under Suchman, the APV became a Socialist
patronage machine, as the party stacked the boards of APV-controlled companies
with its loyalists. "The politicization of nominations goes down to the smallest
companies as a way of getting presents to friends," according to one former APV
staffer.

<P> Asked if he'll do anything to undo this pervasive patronage, Kovacs points
out that the APV's new board is explicitly apolitical. "We're experts, not party
members."

<P> Pressed about whether patronage appointees need fear for their jobs, he said:
"There is no campaign of replacing people."

<P> Putting clean-handed Kovacs in charge of the APV at the end of 1996 might
look like, as Hungarians say, "buying a raincoat after the storm". After all,
privatization should wind up by the end of 1998 and most big deals &#173; ranging
from phone company Matav, to oil and gas monolith MOL, to savings giant OTP, to
tyre maker Taurus &#173; are long done. But all is not lost. The Tocsik affair
has revolutionized Hungary's political culture, educating politicians and the
public alike about accountability and the power of an enraged voter.

<P> Beyond selling the few assets remaining in the Hungarian state's larder,
Kovacs and the APV  will face another important challenge. The sale of $2 billion
worth of gas and electric utilities last December was a coup, putting Hungary
ahead of many west European countries. But important questions were not settled
before the deals were done. Since the sales, several courts have ruled in favour
of city and village officials' arguments that the utilities were, in fact, never
the national government's to sell; the courts have accepted the local officials'
arguments that Hungary's municipalities and villages funded those utilities'
construction in the years after World War II.

<P> Although the government has appealed against these recent decisions, an
adverse superior court ruling might soon force the national government to pass
last year's windfall &#173; some of which has already gone to reducing Hungary's
large foreign debt &#173; over to the aggrieved municipalities. That is the
best-case outcome.

<P> Another possible, more problematic, development is that the deals will be
broken, with the APV left liable to foreign investors for any damages suffered.
Who says it is too late for a raincoat?

<H4> <B>CHILE</B> </H4> 

<H2> <B>Enersis issue breaks records</B> </H2> 

<P>
Flexibility was the key to the success of the November yankee bond offering from
Chilean electric utility Enersis, brought to market by JP Morgan. The transaction
simultaneously broke records for the largest deal size, the lowest spread and the
longest tenor achieved by any Chilean credit.

<P> The deal paves the way for other corporates from Latin America's two
investment-grade countries &#173; Chile and Colombia &#173; to lengthen the
maturity of their debt portfolios. And such was the receptiveness to the 20-year
tranche that market participants believe the first straight 30-year bond by a
Chilean corporate may become a reality within the next 12 months.

<P> The transaction was originally slated as a $500 million offering, but the
roadshow took place at the same time as Enersis was awaiting the results of its
bidding in the privatisation of Companhia de Electricidade de Rio de Janeiro
(Cerj). Enersis executives had told JP Morgan from the outset that a successful
outcome might mean bumping up the deal size. But it was just as the transaction
was ready for launch that the Brazilians announced the results of the bidding
process &#173; Enersis had won a controlling stake.

<P> That was late on Tuesday 19 November, and Enersis scheduled a press
conference in Santiago for the next day. It was thus decided to give investors an
opportunity to digest the news, and push back the launch of the bonds until the
Thursday morning. And it was also during these final hectic few days that the
decision was taken to add a third tranche to the deal, comprising a 30-year note
with a put at seven years, the first time this structure had been used for a
Latin American borrower.

<P> The roadshow, led by Enersis chief executive officer Jose Yuraszeck and chief
financial officer Juan Dominguez, had taken place at a time of exceptionally high
issuance in the US domestic market, but nonetheless attracted lots of attention,
including many accounts that had never before bought Chilean paper. The Enersis
story, centring on its strong electricity generation and distribution operations
in Chile being used as a springboard for expansion in Argentina and Peru, met
with an enthusiastic response, while investors were also told about the likely
impact of the Cerj deal.

<P> "We didn't go to the market with a very defined structure," explains Simon
Noble, vice-president in the Latin America Debt Capital Markets Group at JP
Morgan in New York. "We went with an amount, a likelihood that there would be
tranches, and that they would be tens and twenties, but we wanted to keep
flexibility both to respond to what Enersis wanted and where the investors were
showing the most interest."

<P> The investor base being targeted was institutional buyers of investment-grade
paper, such as pension funds and insurance companies, rather than the usual
emerging markets players who might buy Mexico or Argentina.

<P> It soon became clear to JP Morgan, and to co-managers Salomon Brothers and
Merrill Lynch, that there was particularly strong demand for 20-year paper. This
was not only because some of the buyers had already seen plenty of 10-year paper
offered from Chile earlier in the year, but also because the investment-grade
players being targeted typically have need for longer-dated paper to put in their
portfolios.

<P> Some of the same investors had also recently been buying 30-year bonds with
embedded seven-year put options &#173; issued by US corporate names &#173; and JP
Morgan began to think that this structure might also work for Enersis. "We
started to develop the idea internally the week before," says Noble.

<P> It was decided to offer $150 million worth of the 30-year notes with the 
put, and the granting of this option allowed Enersis to issue at only 61 basis
points over seven-year treasuries.

<P> The 10-year tranche stayed at much the same size as originally intended, with
$300 million worth of bonds offered at a launch spread of 82bp. It was in the
20-year tranche where the biggest size increase took place, with $350 million
worth of the bonds offered, up from the $200 million originally envisaged. These
bonds were priced at 100bp over comparable treasuries.

<P> The final outcome was a blowout. At $800 million the deal ranked as the
largest ever issue done out of Chile. The 20-year tranche established a new
record as the longest tenor achieved by a Chilean borrower. And the 82bp spread
on the 10- year tranche was the finest ever achieved by a Latin American
corporate.<B>Michael Marray</B>

<H3> KERR'S PEOPLE </H3>


<H2> <B>Peter Middleton</B> </H2> 

<P> <B>Chairman, Salomon Brothers
International</B>

<P> Will the real Peter Middleton please stand up. Is he the hero who gave
Lloyd's of London a new lease of life? Is he the fanatical Chelsea supporter who
briefly played power broker in the struggle for management control of the
football club? Is he the former monk and motorcycle enthusiast who might have had
a supporting role in <I>Easy Rider</I>? Is he the hard-nosed London head of a US
investment bank that fell on hard times but is now back in rude health? Is he the
chairman of BZW?

<P> "No. He's the one that pulls all that lovely crumpet," says a City bond
trader who makes no attempt to disguise his envy. What was he talking about? Was
he being serious? How many sides to Peter Middleton are there that we don't know
about?

<P> <B>Monk on a motor-bike</B>

<P> Some of the Middleton myth has faded with the passage of time. It is more
than 30 years since he was a monk. The high-powered motor-bikes have been put on
the blocks following an accident. He is no longer a kingmaker at Chelsea: he
resigned earlier this month after what appears to have been a major disagreement
with feisty controlling shareholder Ken Bates who owns a 25% shareholding but
speaks for another 39% held by Rysaffe, a privately owned Hong Kong-based trust
company. Middleton had wanted to appoint a new executive director following the
death in a helicopter crash of his close friend Matthew Harding, who was also one
of the club's largest shareholders. When Bates refused, Middleton resigned. But
he can count himself a lucky man &#173; he had been offered a seat in Harding's
helicopter the day it crashed.

<P> With so many interests &#173; the boardroom tussle at Chelsea was certainly
time-consuming &#173; how does Middleton find time for the demanding role of
chairman of Salomon Brothers in Europe? By all accounts he is a workaholic who
involves himself in every aspect of the firm's business and is certainly not a
distant figurehead. However, he seems to have been an unusual choice for Salomon,
principally because he had no real investment banking experience. He had also
never been a trader, the usual career path for the bank's most senior executives.

<P> The nearest Middleton came to investment banking was a five-year stint with
Midland Bank where he is credited with turning around the ailing Thomas Cook
travel agency and traveller's cheque subsidiary. However, Midland and Salomon
Brothers are chalk and cheese and even his successful time at Lloyd's was not
seen as the ideal platform for a move into US investment banking.

<P> But Middleton seems to have taken readily to the rough and tumble of Salomon.
And he seems to have been a good luck charm to the firm. He arrived in November
1995. Since then Salomon has reported substantial profits every quarter &#173; a
notable achievement for one of the most volatile securities houses in the
industry. Even Salomon's share price has risen from a low of $41 to $46.25. He is
also winning acclaim as a manager, although as one former employee told me: "You
have to remember that managers at Salomon don't command a high premium &#173; the
only people who really count are the producers."

<P> What about Middleton's legendary reputation as a lady-killer? Married for 30
years to his childhood sweetheart and with three grown-up children, he then
became a gossip-column favourite after a series of romances with three women
young enough to be his daughters. Last month he married a 31-year-old Asian nurse
from Wolverhampton.

<P> Some outsiders have been surprised by his success as he does not immediately
come across as a rival to Pierce Brosnan &#173; or even the perma-tanned George
Hamilton, who is about his age. His suits are noticeably square-cut and his
hair-line is low, or is it the spectacles that are too high? At a drinks party
given to celebrate Charlie McVeigh's 25 years at Salomon Brothers (worthy of a
medal or maybe two) he struck guests as being very intense, a view reinforced
when he made a short speech about Salomon's earnings rather than Charlie's many
achievements.

<P> Will we ever know the real Peter Middleton? Perhaps not, but does it really
matter? At Salomon and in the City he's already becoming part of folklore because
of his private life. Now that he is remarried and settled, how much would
Salomon's macho traders pay for his little black address book?

<H2> <B>Andrew Pisker</B> </H2> <P> <B>Former managing director and head of
global syndication, Lehman Brothers</B>

<P> "Lehman must have been off its trolley to let him walk away". This was the
immediate response of a senior US investment banker when he heard that Andrew
Pisker was leaving the firm after 15 years. Pisker quit on November 6 without any
immediate plans to join another Euromarket house.

<P> What's so special about Pisker that attracted a wave of publicity? Is it that
he was an internationally ranked tennis star? Is it perhaps his stunning second
wife, Belinda, or his reputed collection of Ferraris? Is it because the rumours
that he had been asked to run BZW's international bond operation before Bob
Diamond have never quite gone away?

<P> Certainly Pisker has a lot going for him. Despite 15 years with Lehman, he's
just 37. He was the only European head of a global division at Lehman and the
only European on the fixed-income management committee. Those achievements stand
out in a firm dominated by Americans in New York who are said to regard their
international operations as side-shows.

<P> Over 15 years Pisker had seen the best and the worst of Lehman. The best
times were when he arrived in the early 1980s and the last two years when Lehman
went public and had to prove to highly sceptical investors that it could stand on
its own. In between there was a decade of the dark ages highlighted by outright
personal greed, internal jealousies, gross senior management incompetence and
life under fourth-division Shearson and then under ponderous, blinkered American
Express.

<P> So why quit when Lehman has finally begun to clean up its mess? Was there
more than just a difference of opinion about the future direction of the firm?
Did Pisker seek greater recognition for Lehman's international operations &#173;
after all, far superior firms such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs generate
more than half their revenues from international operations and growth prospects
for many businesses are better overseas than in North America. Did he choose to
stand up to Richard Fuld, the firm's socially stilted chairman and CEO, whose
rise to the top was principally a consequence of the departure of others?

<P> Although a toe-to-toe confrontation with Fuld never took place &#173;
Pisker's main conversations were with London chief executive Bruce Lakefield
&#173; Pisker may have expected to be given greater responsibility for running
Lehman's international fixed-income business. Although not a publicity seeker,
Pisker was Lehman's Mr Euromarket &#173; not just because he'd been with the firm
so long, but also because of his success in establishing Lehman Brothers as a
serious international new-issue house. With the help of Jonathan Hakim's European
origination team and close cooperation with the firm's US domestic bond group, Pisker had pushed
Lehman into eighth place in the international new-issue league tables this year.
That's above UBS, Salomon Brothers, Nomura and ABN-Amro. Lehman was also
beginning to close on seventh-placed Credit Suisse First Boston, once the
undisputed Euromarkets leader. Although houses such as BZW, HSBC and ABN-Amro
were still seeking to win global mandates, Lehman was already writing big-ticket
global issues for the World Bank, Tennessee Valley Authority, Korea Development
Bank, Exim Bank and the main US government agencies.

<P> <B>Not one of us</B>

<P> No-one at Lehman denies Pisker's achievements and he is being paid his full
1996 bonus. But did the all-American Lehman leaders consider that he was no
longer "one of us" after he had been approached early in the year by BZW to take
on the job now held by Bob Diamond? Pisker denied the rumours to outsiders at the
time, as did BZW. However, the denials were at best a smoke screen, at worst a
lie. Pisker was offered the headship of BZW's entire fixed-income business. He
was to begin as deputy chief executive and then move up when Sam Marrone, the
ineffective CEO, was relocated within the Barclays Group. Marrone has since quit
to join ABN-Amro in New York.

<P> If Pisker did irretrievably fall out with New York, Lehman's executive
committee there must be seen as very short-sighted. Pisker was a pillar of the
organization in Europe, an example to prospective employees who were told by
competitors that "Lehman will never be a true bulge-bracket firm". He is still an
unrepentant admirer of his old firm but outsiders believe he was let down by
Lehman's management. They say that London resident CEO Bruce Lakefield, a former
US Navy nuclear submarine commander, should have put handcuffs on Pisker. One
commented: "I can only hope that Lakefield's captaincy of Lehman in Europe
doesn't follow the film sequence of <I>Grey Lady Down</I>." As for Andrew Pisker,
like as not he'll soon be commanding his own ship.

<H2> <B>John Sanderson</B> </H2> <P> <B>Managing director, Legg, Mason
Limited</B>

<P> What do you do after 32 years in the City of London as one of the most highy
regarded US equity salesman? Hang up the golden pen reserved for taking those
really large block orders? Count your country houses or calculate how many extra
days' shooting would be required to make pheasants into an endangered species?
Perhaps take a small tour to the remaining six or seven restaurants with a
Michelin star you have not already visited?

<P> John Sanderson, 51, turned down all these options, though he may have been
sorely tempted. Instead he elected to open an office in London for
Baltimore-based US stockbroker Legg, Mason. The Baltimore area is dominated by
two brokers, Alex Brown and Legg, Mason, between which there's a fierce but
generally amicable rivalry. Legg, Mason, though, is a relative upstart since Legg
&amp; Co was only founded in 1899. By contrast, Alexander Brown &amp; Sons was,
according to Vincent Carosso's <I>Investment Banking in America</I>, established
in 1800 as a linen merchant which "carried on both financial and mercantile
operations simultaneously in the manner of European houses." Legg, Mason was
formed in the early 1960s when Raymond (Chip) Mason, the current chairman and
CEO, took effective control. Today the Mason interests own around 35% of the
publicly quoted firm, with the next largest shareholder, Alliance Capital, owning
11%.

<P> Sanderson's move to join Legg, Mason came as a surprise to many of his
friends because he had spent the previous 28 years with Kidder, Peabody. "John
was part of Kidder's very high quality London sales team which included the
unmistakeable figure of David Thomson (only five foot six inches but usually
weighing about 400 lbs), Peter Forster and the office manager, Jason Bacon," says
a former Cazenove partner.

<P> Who can remember the City back in 1963? That was the year when Sanderson
arrived to work as a blue-button (a glorified gofer on the floor of the Stock
Exchange) for Lumsden &amp; Co, which eventually became part of Henry Cooke,
Lumsden &amp; Co. In those days a pound bought eight pints of beer or seven
packets of premium-quality cigarettes. The standard three-shilling luncheon
voucher could actually buy a basic pub lunch. The only skyscrapers in the City
were Lee House and Moor House in London Wall. In those days &#173; it seems
almost unbelievable in 1996 &#173; London Wall was considered to be on the
"outskirts" of the City. All the action was close to the Bank of England and the
Stock Exchange. A good address was "within five minutes' walk of the Bank".

<P> <B>Nickels and dimes</B>

<P> After training at Philip Hill, Erlanger, Sanderson joined Kidder, Peabody as
a salesman in 1967. Kidder had an excellent reputation in London and could claim
a close working relationship with Barings that went back to the 19th century.
Kidder was also very close to Cazenove, the premier "Establishment" London house
and a major underwriter. Sanderson thrived at Kidder &#173; he became a partner
in 1979 and by 1988 had taken over Jason Bacon's position as manager of the
equity sales group. But Kidder's reputation had plummeted after the 1986
acquisition by General Electric and by the 1990s there was a rotten core in its
mortgage-backed trading business. When trader Joe Jett's scam hit the headlines
in March 1994, GE pulled the plug. By the end of that year Kidder had been sold
for little more than nickels and dimes to PaineWebber.

<P> Sanderson, with his old colleague Peter Forster, is relishing his new
challenge at Legg, Mason which is not just a traditional brokerage house but also
a major fund manager with more than $40 billion of total assets. There were the
usual problems and delays in obtaining licences to open the London office but
Sanderson says that business has been "up to expectations for our first full
year". Old friends at the main UK institutions have generally been very
supportive and the Legg, Mason name has been a valuable asset and calling-card.
Sanderson's one regret is that "many UK fund managers simply missed most of the
2,000 points on the Dow." Is it simply a coincidence that the London offices of
Legg, Mason are in Founders Court, Lothbury, almost exactly halfway between the
Bank of England and Cazenove. "It may have been at the back of our minds but
would our clients really want us to be located in Canary Wharf?" comments
Sanderson. How true.

<H3> AGAINST THE TIDE </H3>


<H3> <B>Europe's faded photocopy democracy </B> </H3> 

<P> <B>by David Roche</B>

<P> European monetary union (EMU) now seems almost certain. But the politics of
running the single currency are not straightforward.

<P> Germany wants to free the running of EMU from national political influence.
Under the terms of a stability pact, EMU member states would be fined
automatically if they broke fiscal targets. Similarly, Germany and the other core
European states aim to ensure that monetary policy is smoothly controlled by an
independent central bank, the European Central Bank (ECB), in the style of the
Bundesbank. So the euro will be strong from the outset and kept so.

<P> Thus Europe's voters will have little influence on either European monetary
or fiscal policy. They will elect national politicians and parties, who will
select executives and leaders who will make up the Council of Europe (formerly
the Council of Ministers), which will elect the ECB's executive board, which will
dominate monetary decision-making. Also, if there is to be a stability council
(to run the stability pact), made up of EMU countries' finance ministers, then
responsibility for fiscal policy will also have largely been shifted to a distant
institution. And even if there is no stability council, the automatism of the
stability pact itself would ensure that fiscal policy becomes even less subject
to democratic discretion and sovereign decision-making.

<P> Voters will recognize only a fourth-hand version of their chosen leaders'
ideas. It's photocopy democracy, where instituted Euro legislation becomes a
faded version of original policy. Photocopy democracy happens when elected
officials are no longer able, or don't have the quality, to take tough economic
decisions directly. These decisions then get relegated to increasingly distant
institutions, which cannot be targeted by voters. Blame is deflected from elected
politicians and tough decisions are implemented by the<I> deus ex machina</I> of
a distant Zeus at the head of Europe's unaccountable institutions.

<P> Ultimately though, photocopy democracy contains the seeds of its own undoing.
At some point, I believe, there will be a popular reaction. And that's when EMU
unravels. But it will probably be long after EMU's inception.

<P> About the same time as you read this, an EU summit will attempt to finalize
the stability pact for fiscal control under EMU, and the ERM-2 currency
arrangements. Both require unanimous agreement between EU member states. We
expect a rigorous, German-style stability pact to be signed, forming a solid,
credible foundation for EMU.

<P> But failure to agree a pact &#173; even a short-term "technical" delay &#173;
would risk significant financial market volatility. Neither chancellor Helmut
Kohl of Germany, the great protagonist of an integrated Europe, nor the leaders
of the Southern Comfort Country (SCC) bloc, want that. Any delay means the
unwinding of European bond yield convergence. And that means higher interest
rates and bigger budget deficits in the periphery.

<P> <B>In the waiting room</B>

<P> An ERM-2 will probably be announced at the same time as the stability pact.
It is intended as a waiting room for the currencies of those countries which fail
to get into EMU at its launch. The idea is to prevent them from gaining
competitive advantage over the euro bloc by depreciating their currencies ahead
of later EMU accession. The likely structure would be a series of "fluctuation
bands" with a maximum of &#177;15%, similar to the current ERM.

<P> Just as today's ERM is regulated by the European Monetary Institute (EMI), so
ERM-2 would be run by the ECB. In theory, all EMU hopefuls would have to be ERM-2
members ahead of accession, and most as soon as EMU is launched. In practice,
though, it is not clear whether ERM-2 membership for at least two years would be
a requirement for EMU entry (as membership of the original ERM is now).

<P> Countries in ERM-2 won't see their bond yields rocket because they're in what
markets will perceive as a short-term EMU ante-chamber. The likelihood of a
country staying in ERM-2, but being refused EMU entry for more than a year or
two, is extremely low. So either EMU convergence would drive an ERM-2 country's
bond yields towards those of the euro bloc and keep its currency stable, or
long-term EMU exclusion would generate bigger spreads and currency volatility.
It's a black-and-white scenario with no middle ground.

<P> Then in January, the EMI meets to discuss its own transformation into the
ECB. As the monetary policy-machine of EMU, the ECB's role is key. But who will
control it? If EMU begins with nine countries, the ECB's governing council will
initially have 15 members. First, it will include each national central bank
governor in the EMU bloc. Each governor will serve a five-year term and be
re-electable. Second, it will also have a six-member executive board, which will
help decide European monetary policy and ensure that it is properly implemented.

<P> The executive board's members will be selected by the Council of Europe
&#173; again from EMU member states. Each member of the executive board will have
a vote equal to those of the central bank heads in the ECB governing council. The
executive board will have an eight-year tenure, but will not be re-electable.

<P> <B>Who's in, who's out?</B>

<P> Wim Duisenberg, the Dutch head of the EMI, will serve as the executive
board's president. And a German will almost certainly be vice-president. As
"core" countries are also likely to secure two other seats on the ECB executive
board, the core will have nine seats on the first ECB governing council. As such,
it will have a working majority to dominate European monetary policy.

<P> Finally, in spring 1998, the Council of Europe will make its decision on
who's in and who's out of EMU. This will be based on two recommended lists &#173;
one from the EMI, another from the EU Commission. The vote will be on complete
lists of countries, not individual countries. The EU Commission's list will be
soft on the Maastricht criteria and long on politics. The EMI's list is likely to
be closer to the Bundesbank's ideal of strict application of the criteria. But
the two lists will probably be fused into one behind the scenes, long before the
Council of Europe votes, to avoid financial market volatility.

<P> Of course, this "behind closed doors" decision will be politically charged.
It will effectively determine which countries decide European monetary policy
from EMU's inception, and those which simply have to accept ECB directives.
That's because only first-wave EMU members will be considered for the ECB
executive board's first eight-year term. And countries with membership of the ECB
executive board will have a decisive numerical advantage over those countries
represented on the ECB governing council only by their central bank heads.

<P> If EMU is unstoppable, so is European bond yield convergence. The biggest
gains to be made from this are in Italian bonds and in UK gilts &#173; as I think
the UK cannot afford to stay outside a big, strong-currency euro-bloc &#173;
particularly if it's a high growth region to boot. And EMU will be unstoppable
unless the German coalition falls to bits; Kohl dies a hasty political death, or
there is sub-1% growth in core Europe next year. I ascribe a 60% probability to
EMU happening on time, and 40% to delay due to these risks.

<P> The euro will start life as a strong currency characterized by fiscal
discipline and Bundesbank-style monetary policy. Later its deep economic flaws
may weaken it. Growth lies at the heart of the EMU equity argument too.
Initially, at least, the EMU bloc will have little to gain from a weak euro.
Foreign currency-denominated exports will have shrunk from 22% of GDP to 13% for
the euro bloc as a whole. A weak euro would undoubtedly spur this small export
segment of GDP, but it would be offset by higher domestic interest rates and
weaker domestic demand under a German-dominated ECB hell bent on proving its
credibility.

<P> So the route to fast growth is high domestic demand inside the EMU bloc,
which absorbs the vast bulk of output. The way to achieve that is with a strong
currency and low interest rates. This would set up a virtuous circle of falling
budget deficits and public debt (as a percentage of GDP), compliance with the
stability pact, falling interest rates, higher investment, more growth and more
jobs. The fact that a consumer boom in Italy might widen its trade deficit with
Germany would no longer matter in a unified currency bloc, any more than Nevada's
trade deficit with California does!

<P> <B>Handcuffed to Germany's progress</B>

<P> And it's likely that compliance with the Maastricht criteria, and later the
stability pact, will cut the role of government in Europe's national income, and
not just increase the tax take. Shrinking government is a very powerful booster
to profit share in national income, as long as what governments free up is not
grabbed by wages. And it's not likely to be. Labour market reform is springing up
all over Europe &#173; advanced in some countries like the UK and the
Netherlands, under way in Spain, and incipient in Germany. From here, Germany
will drive the process. Other countries, no matter how different their cultures,
will be handcuffed to Germany's progress by the stability pact, which will force
similar changes upon them to price their unemployed into jobs.

<P> The post-EMU world looks good for Europe's corporate sector. But EMU's faded
democracy, in which national electorates have little or no influence over
decisions on currency, public spending and interest rates, is a fertile field for
populist reaction. That could eventually bring the euro to its knees.

<H3> DIARY OF AN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT BANKER  </H3>



<H2> <B>A new way to calculate bonuses </H2>

<H4> Ingersoll and Komarovsky learn to suffer while Iceberg preserves his golf swing</B> </H4>

<P> JJ Ingersoll, our
head of global focus, looks distraught. I walk into his office where the NFL
playoffs dominate his 25 screen info-revolution wall. "Are you running a book on
this?" I ask, looking at the spread on the score. JJ rolls his eyes, upwards and
onwards, almost beating the elevator to the 85th floor. 

 <P> He passes me an
immaculate ready-for-publication piece of paper, topped with the firm's new logo,
a harpsichord inside a US dollar sign, and its new global-slogan message, coined
by our new head of global scansion, Kristina Onomatopeia-a-Stasis. I look at it:
"Banking was founded on a bench in Renaissance Italy," it reads. "Black Knight
&#173; the art of banking. Call freefone 123-Glasso-Steagallo." Beneath is a
disclaimer:<I>This message is not intended to sell you anything. Consult local
regulators for details. Corporate headquarters in Delaware.</I>

<P> "More of the same", I comment. "No," JJ hisses, "not that client crap &#173;
the memo beneath." The catchy new slogan and global-image-presence had taken my
eye momentarily off the ball, or rather the memo from our chairman, Ace Iceberg,
which reads:

<P> <I>November 30, 1996. To all general and limited
partners, and other liabilities</I>. <I>Subject: killing two birds with one
club.</I> It's at this time of year that my usually excellent golf swing starts
to seize up. You know why? I believe, and local golf pros corroborate my
conclusions, that it's because I spend so much of the month of November signing
bonus checks. This is not good for my wrist, and causes a slicing action to
develop. While my golfing partners appear to have got used to this annual
dropping-off in my game, I haven't.

<P> So when myself and the little guy, Halmchinkel Maladroit Analretentive, were
out at Madame Fou-fou's last week we came up with an idea. I think it's excellent
and I'm sure you will too.

<P> This year I'm going to take all them checks to the driving range, attach a
pen to the end of my club and play through them, one by one.

<P> With a handicap like mine you can be sure that some of those checks will be
invalidated. This, however, will be good for the bottom line. So don't get too
disappointed if you receive an envelope containing ripped pieces of starchy paper
rather than the sum you were expecting.

<P> Just to be fair, I'm getting Arnold Palmer to sign my $8.5 million on a
putting green somewhere in Santa Monica four inches from the cup. The full board
will be there to watch and get his autograph afterwards."

<P> As if this was not bad enough, says JJ, and it is, Iceberg's personal
assistant, Cutter Ensign, has introduced a whole series of algebraic formulas to
make the process of bonus determination more account-friendly.

<P> These as you can imagine are fantastically complex.

<P> The calculation goes something like this. Every department
is divided according to its contribution to pre-tax net revenues, and then
compartmentalized according to its proximity to elevator shafts, its number of
desks, and the ratio of how many cups of coffee to Dr Peppers it drinks during
Asian trading hours. A department's collective weight (with shoes on), is used to
fine tune the process, and kicks-in a depreciation factor for the erosive effects
on carpet-weave of the chief trader's 300 pounds, and the number of times per
hour the graduate trainees are sent out for burgers.

<P> This provides the initial "cut", and determines which departments get zip.

<P> Departmental heads then rank staff on a score of one to 60.8, divide the
result by the wind speed (in West Ridge, Iowa), square the result, examine
individual wear and tear on computer keyboards penalizing heavy-finger users on a
four-point scale, factor in vending-machine costs, lactation room overheads,
overhead airline pollution, internal memo production costs, state skyscraper
taxes, stock tips for the window cleaner (or natural light enhancement
consultants, as they now wish to be called), write-offs for rogue traders, and
finally add 100, subtract 101, divide by four, and multiply by two, amortize in a
microwave for two minutes, then convert any distance-error from yards into
millimetres, discounting the cashflow completely.

<P> The result is an amazingly accurate figure for an
employee's output accurate to four decimal places across the 325 trading days
(before Christmas). It excludes occupational risk, breathing space constraints,
and Whelk's law of motion. Otherwise, it's perfect.

<P> Though no one has yet seen the fruits of the new system, all of those who
aren't going to leave anyway, are every bit as concerned by Cutter Ensign's so
called equal and opposite initiative to slash costs "beyond the bone, taking out
just enough marrow to keep the patient alive and able to write tickets," as he
was heard telling someone in the gents. The memo arrived last Friday.

<P> <I>To all staff, including jj Ingersoll</I>: It has
come to my attention that expenses are too high based on our forecast profits of
$997 million for the year. I have some ideas:

<P> 1&#009;Telephones. I sometimes wish we could return to the days of two paper
cups attached by a piece of string. Alas the cost of a piece of string from New
York to Tokyo is even more expensive than present arrangements. But staff should
restrict greetings to "Hi [shorter than hello], this is x at Black Knight." Then
say, "I hear the kids are alright. Listen I think we can do a bit of business for
you."

<P> 2&#009;Decaff coffee is expensive. Can't you just drink it at home and behave
like a normal person at work?

<P> 3&#009;It is, of course, permissible to use a cellular phone in cases of
family tragedy, but just to phone up and say Hi, I'm alive, how's your day been
honey, is completely unnecessary. Our phone operator has been instructed to
disconnect any call where the words "honey", "baby", "darlin" or "squidgy" occur.

<P> 4&#009;Fax machines. Surely there must be a more cost-efficient way of
dealing with clients? I suggest the Internet, and I have just employed a
consultant on a $6 million retainer to show us how.

<P> 5&#009;Expense claims are sloppy and often lacking in justification. Bribing
Italian &#173; as I saw on one recent claim &#173; is hardly acceptable. For tax
purposes we need to know<I> which</I> Italian.

<P> 6&#009;My next memo will offer suggestions on how to make business travel
more efficient. For example, if we all took our family holidays at airport
Sheratons we'd get fantastically competitive block deals. The food is much better
in airports than it used to be, so have a think about it.

<H3> FINANCIAL LAWYER </H3>


<H2> <B>Divided by a common language </B> </H2>

<H4> <B> Does it matter whether a securities issue
is written under English or New York law? 
Probably not, if you are as well advised on the consequences
of not using a jurisdiction as of using it. By Christopher
Stoakes </B> </H4> 


<P> Nowadays, any UK law firm active in financial transactions
will have its complement of US lawyers, and vice versa. The rationale is that
English and New York law &#173; the two most prevalent governing laws in
international financing transactions &#173; are virtually fungible these days.
What determines the governing law of a transaction will be the preference of the
parties involved, the lender or underwriters' country of origin or location, or
the whereabouts of the borrower's assets.

<P> However, a line of cases involving attempts by US Names (investors in the
Lloyd's of London insurance market) to avoid their liabilities has demonstrated
that the two legal systems are not identical. The cases are relevant to the
capital markets in general because they concern the ability of non-US issuers of
securities to circumvent the application of US securities laws by choosing a
governing law other than that of New York. The cases came to the fore over the
last three years when Lloyd's was putting in place its reconstruction and renewal
plan (completed in September this year). During the booming 1980s, Lloyd's had
attracted an influx of new Names at a time which, in retrospect, was
inauspicious: US courts were making awards against US companies for long-tail
liability &#173; pollution and asbestosis cases going back decades.

<P> These companies claimed on their Lloyd's policies, which
responded. In 1985 Lloyd's changed its policy wording to prevent such open-ended
liability from arising again. But the damage, as far as the past was concerned,
was done. Losses escalated, not helped by a coincidence of catastrophes &#173;
hurricanes and oil-rig losses. The US is Lloyd's largest overseas market: over
half of its business is written in dollars and it maintains a trust fund in the
US, under the auspices of the New York Insurance Department, to meet the claims
of US policyholders.

<P> As losses mounted, US Names felt duped. In the 1990s, various of them brought
actions in the US courts, alleging a smorgasbord of civil offences on the part of
Lloyd's, ranging from fraud and misrepresentation to breaches of US securities
laws. Their argument was that membership of Lloyd's, like the holding of a share
in a company, was a security and that Lloyd's had been in breach of federal and
state "blue skies" laws by not distributing a prospectus and complying with
obligations to register and so on. If the Names were right, they would not have
to meet their liabilities and Lloyd's would be unable to pursue them. However,
they lost in a string of cases because their agreement with Lloyd's specified
that any disputes would be settled according to English law in English courts.
The US courts took notice of this and refused to entertain the Names' claims,
saying that English law provided its own remedies to which the US Names should
resort.

<P> However, in this respect the two jurisdictions are not identical. The US has
some of the toughest securities laws in the world, in order to prevent retail
investors from being preyed upon. These include Rico, the Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act, originally implemented to trap mobsters crossing
state lines, but with a wider ambit. These laws would not be enforced by an
English court, which would apply domestic UK law such as the Misrepresentation
Act 1967 (originally enacted to protect credit consumers) and common law fraud
and mistake. These remedies are more even-handed than their US counterparts since
they are not securities-specific and the UK, with its self-regulatory regime,
does not have a history of securities regulation comparable to that which spawned
such US federal agencies as the Securities and Exchange Commission.

<P> What particularly perplexed some lawyers was the fact that the US laws
invoked by the Names contain anti-waiver provisions: they expressly say that you
cannot get around them by specifying that they do not apply &#173; because the
legislature felt they provided protections not available elsewhere. But that was
precisely the effect of the provisions in the Lloyd's agreements. Most people's
understanding of securities regulation is this: what matters is where I
distribute securities, not the governing law which I say applies. If I distribute
securities on the streets of Manhattan without complying with SEC requirements, I
am potentially in trouble. If I sell securities to Eskimoes, the SEC will not be
concerned even if I specify New York law as governing the transaction, unless
there is some other nexus with the US &#173; for instance a US issuer or
underwriter &#173; which provides the SEC with a reason for asserting its
jurisdiction.

<P> What also upset observers was that the courts' decision not to entertain the
cases was based on their view that the jurisdiction specified (in these cases the
UK) provided adequate alternative remedies &#173; a subjective assessment which
does not confer the certainty that law is intended to provide. However, these
cases, <I>Roby</I> and <I>Bonny</I>, are not necessarily the last word. In
<I>Leslie</I> (another Lloyd's case, decided last year) the judge ruled that
while English courts were as good as their Texan cousins, it would be against
public policy to deprive the plaintiffs of their rights under local Texan law.

<P> What are the implications for bankers? The first is that
these insurance-related cases can cross over into the capital markets. In <I>pt
Adimitra Rayapratama v Bankers Trust</I> (also decided last year), Bankers Trust
was sued over the sale of a swap sold under the terms of the Isda master
agreement, which specifies English law as governing and the UK courts as having
jurisdiction. The case was thrown out for that reason.

<P> The second implication is that it pays to be advised on both English and New
York law in international financial transactions, which is why in the last few
months there has been an increase in moves by partners between US and UK law
firms. For example, US firm Shearman &amp; Sterling has recently lost one of its
top securities partners, Tom Joyce, to UK law firm Freshfields but has recruited
four partners &#173; all English lawyers specializing in project finance &#173;
from fellow US firm Milbank Tweed Hadley &amp; McCloy. "It's a common fallacy
that a prospectus is written under a governing law. It isn't. A prospectus isn't
written under any law," explains Stephen Edlmann, head of capital markets at
Linklaters &amp; Paines, which has just hired Stephen Land, formerly a tax
partner with US firm Howard Darby &amp; Levin, bringing the UK firm's complement
of US lawyers to 17. "It's the liabilities which arise out of distributing a
prospectus which can be triggered by the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
distributed."

<H3> THE MOORGATE SAGA  </H3>


<H3> <B>Catchgrouch</B> </H3> 

<P> <B>Last National Bank of Boot Hill, Moorgate,
London EC2</B>

<P>

<IMG SRC="Images/em.96.12.20a.gif" WIDTH=168 HEIGHT=40 ALIGN=TOP>


<P> The trouble starts as usual with Harvey Q Schicklgruber III.V, who is our
senior vice president (strategy and forward planning), in most corporations this
title means the guy has no place in their strategic forward plans, but Harvey is
the favourite great nephew of old Mr Schicklgruber, our president, you look at
him and wonder what the other great nephews are like.

<P> It seems Harvey reads in <I>Loaded</I> or the <I>Tombstone Epitaph</I> or
some such blatt how Europe has this scheme for a new currency, replacing all the
others, to be called the euro or emu and be managed out of Frankfurt by a guy
called Duisenberg they hire from Rentadutchman, so Harvey wishes to know in broad
strategic outline what the bank's international presence in the London office
plans to do about this.

<P> Like if there is only one currency around here what do our
foreign exchange dealers find to do all day, and how do we know if these euro
notes fit in our teller machines, and can we be first off the blocks with some
euro innovation, or at least sponsor a seminar, by invitation only, Harvey
fancies Cannes in May, and besides, how soon can we up sticks from Moorgate and
relocate to Frankfurt where the action is?

<P> Mom, if Harvey ever goes to Frankfurt looking for some action he had better
not go on a Tuesday, because that is the day she goes to Wiesbaden to see her
aunt, or so the guys in Guten Morgen Grenfell tell me, it is why they go to so
much trouble  to set up shop in London, even if they now get told the place lacks
discipline.

<P> But about this euro or emu or whatever, the Brits' official line is to lie
down and hope the whole thing goes away, which saves them making up their minds,
and meanwhile the Bank of England says that London is prepared for anything, so
nobody need worry, tho' the old hands in the Bankers Club figure when the Bank
says this it is the signal to start worrying.

<P> I take a straw poll there at the Martini hour, where the mood is we all look
forward to the euro because then we can go short of it, remember the ERM, just
think of the money we make shorting sterling, and even more money betting that
the whole shebang breaks up, and when it does this gets blamed on an Anglo Saxon
conspiracy of guys in red suspenders, fame at last!

<P> The keenest guy of all is Stani, who looks in for a glass or two for old
sake's sake, he says once this euro gets started all the Brits need to do is stay
out, then London can become the centre of the euro euro market, this is how we
get started all these years ago, he says, maybe it is not too late to reinvent
White Weld.

<P> Even so I am not sure this is the line to take with Harvey, in his game he
gets his ideas at airport bookstands, for six bucks some snake oil merchant
passes on the secret of how to get a seven digit bonus out of corporate strategic
creativity, so Harvey expects to see inspiring prose with bullet points and
executive summaries, tho' maybe for him they need summarizing.

<P> I figure our experienced public relations adviser must know who can write
this sort of junk for us and dress it up as a report, sure he can, over lunch at
the Dealmakers Arms he offers to find a foundation that commissions a research
shop to call up some economist and see if he has anything in his word processor
that fits the bill, and then all we need (he says) is a design consultant and a
print buyer, it mounts up, of course, no point in trying to do these things on
the cheap, Angelo, I say, can you give the liqueur cart a fair wind, there is a
drought round here.

<P> He has a deal, at that, I figure it is well worth three months' revenues if I
get Harvey off my back, all I insist is this economist of his looks in on me and
tells the story like it is, the unsanitized version, just in case I ever need to
know, but afterwards I feel just like the guy who goes to see John Foster Dulles,
on account he is confused about the State Department's policy, and when he comes
out he is still confused, but on a much higher level.

<P> The way I get it from him, this euro club means different things to different
players, for the French it is a plan for coping with the Germans, after the plans
they try in 1870 and 1914 and 1940 they figure it is time for a new one, and this
suits the Germans too, like this they dress up as good Europeans and can throw
their weight around and look respectable.

<P> Then the Belgians hope they can palm off their national debt on the Germans,
and the Irish vote for anything so long as their monthly check keeps on coming
from Brussels, and the Club Med agrees, most of all the Italians, they figure if
they can get their finances out of the grasp of Italian governments this must be
an improvement, and their government feels that way too, and of course it rigs
the books in this good cause, or one set of books, on account Italy is the
birthplace of double entry book keeping.

<P> This becomes a matter of national pride, every country
must show that it qualifies, the French help themselves to $6 billion out of a
pension fund to put their books straight and get their guy in Brussels to certify
that this is quite OK, and this euro or emu begins to look less like a proof
strength currency and more like a fruit cocktail.

<P> By now, my economist says, the penny is starting to drop in the markets, the
search is on for safe havens, like the Swiss franc and even sterling, the closer
you look at this euro club the more it looks like the club that Groucho Marx
declines to join, who would want to join if it admits the candidates it has lined
up?

<P> I just hope the guy can rewrite this in an airport bookstand style so it
keeps Harvey quiet, but I dare say strategy and forward planning are what land
Europe in this mess in the first place, much love from

<P> Your clubbable son

<H3>A SUPPLEMENT TO EUROMONEY/DECEMBER 1996</H3> <BR>

<H3> Asian property: reaching ever higher </H3> <BR>

<H3> Supply and foreign demand </H3> 

<H4> <B>Foreign companies are driving top-end property prices ever higher. </B> 


<B>But will underlying demand keep pace with development plans? Gill Baker reports on the property
markets of Asia</B> </H4> 

<P> The ebb and flow of foreign confidence in Asian
countries has had a dramatic affect on demand for Asian property. While domestic
fortunes will always constitute the core of underlying demand for property, it is
overseas players which are driving the top end of the market.

<P> Hong Kong remains the powerhouse of Asia's property markets and the 1997
hand-over to China was well and truly factored into the market a long time ago.
Hong Kong's success looks set to spill into mainland China's property market,
with massive growth forecast in office supply. In China foreigners are propping
up the commercial and top-end residential market in the key centres of Shanghai,
Beijing and Guangzhou.

<P> But restrictions in a number of Asian countries on foreign ownership of
property have kept most foreigners firmly in the leasehold and rented end of both
the residential and commercial markets.

<P> Where market regulations are more liberal, foreign commercial demand for
business property has led to growing investment from developers, often from
neighbouring Asian countries. Singapore-listed Wing Tai Holdings is a typical
example in its attempt to replicate its transformation from garment manufacturer
to property developer in Singapore through its 45% owned Malaysian associate DNP
Holdings. Analysts say DNP holdings has amassed 10.6 million square feet of
residential and commercial land in Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Prai in Malaysia.

<P> Many Asian property markets have started to mature. Research and valuation
are taken ever more seriously and large-scale property development and investment
companies have entered even the smaller markets. But a shortage of experienced
analysts dogs Asia's property market &#173; a surprising number of research
houses still do not cover the sector.

<P> Opportunities for speculation abound in Asia's diverse property markets. Hong
Kong is riding another boom, Singapore is slowing down, while some say Thailand
is on the brink of collapse.

<P> <B>Hong Kong </B>

<P> The Mass Transit Railway Corporation project and the hand-over to mainland
China are old news in Hong Kong. Land reclamation is now the largest single
factor affecting Hong Kong's cramped property market. Although the market is at
its crest, the island's encroachment into the sea could be its eventual downfall.
Analysts fear that land reclamation and continuing property development will
cause an over-supply in the market. Listed Sun Hung Kai Properties, the largest
property company in the territory, has said it will spend HK$14 billion ($1.7
billion) on development in the current financial year to June.

<P> Most analysts still agree that Hong Kong's property market is the one to
watch.  "Hong Kong is one of the best markets in Asia because of the shortage of
supply and substantial demand, particularly in the top-end luxury residential
market, and that will continue throughout 1997," says David Runciman, Asia
chairman for international property consultancy and estate agency Richard Ellis.
Residential prices in Hong Kong have been hitting the highs reached in the 1984
boom at the peak of the last property cycle, and the bull run is expected to
continue according to ING Barings.

<P> Residential and non-residential sales rose an impressive 31.7% month-on-month
in October, with 13,889 agreements signed for property across the board,
according to latest Land Registry figures. Apartment sales alone were valued at
HK$18 billion.

<P> The performance of Hong Kong's commercial sector, however, is open to debate.
"There is a lot of speculation going on and some hope that Chinese money will
come into the market," says an analyst at ING Barings. In the long-term, however,
there is still the spectre of over-supply in the office market in particular. The
question is whether or not there will be sufficient demand in the future.

<P> The Hong Kong and Chinese economies have been slowing relative to their
heydays of double digit growth, yet property prices are still rising. Rents in
Wan Chai North, Admiralty, Causeway Bay and North Point rose in October according
to the Vigers/Bridge Hong Kong property index.

<P> <B>Singapore</B>

<P> Singapore's property market appears to be defying the economic signals,
remaining steady despite the slowing economy.

<P> Although sentiment is weak in the residential market, according to Tan Khow
Siong, property analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the standstill between
buyers and sellers has kept prices stable. Research by Richard Ellis describes
the deadlock between buyers and sellers as "a temporary disparity in expectations
between sellers and buyers as both wait for a clearer direction of the market".

<P> Says Scott Poland, a London-based analyst at Citibank's real estate division:
"There has been a lot of speculation on the residential side, and that is where
the concern is going to be. It's going to be a tough year in 1997."

<P> The Singapore government's measures to curb speculation, introduced in May,
had, and continue to have an impact. Applications to buy private properties fell
40% from May to June this year. The measures include restrictions on housing
loans and the introduction of a tax on income gains from property sold within
three years.

<P> But despite the crackdown, there were 11,000 applications for the 592 units
in Pidemco Land's new executive condominium developments of Eastvale and
Westmere. And the market saw the launch of 15 new private residential
developments in the third quarter, putting an extra 2,300 units onto the market.
Richard Ellis still expects to see a 10% average price increase for the full
year.

<P> The market is likely to remain patchy for the rest of the year unless the
price deadlock can be resolved. But with the hand-over of Hong Kong, Singapore
will continue to attract more business, and money.

<P> <B>Philippines</B>

<P> "We are in a sort of a limbo at the moment. We entered 1996 relatively
bullishly but towards mid year there crept in more anxiety about supply," says
Raffy Manalaysay, director of research at broker Crosby UBP Securities in Manila.
"Now people are waiting for the so-called bubble to burst," he adds.

<P> Manalaysay is concerned by the rapid price rises of the past three years. But
Crosby believes that no such bubble exists, just isolated problem areas,
particularly in the high-end luxury residential market.  The market has become
fragmented with office and residential markets going their own separate ways.

<P> "Our biggest area of concern is the high-end vertical residential market,"
says Manalaysay. The ambitious Fort Bonifacio development, a 214 hectare former
state-owned site which is being developed into Manila's third business centre, is
expected to have another dozen or so projects under way in the next six to nine
months, many of them high-rise luxury residential buildings. But Manalaysay
dismisses its effect, and that of satellite development Filinvest Corporate City,
as discounted in the market already.

<P> As a whole, the Philippine property market looks fairly healthy: the economy
is expanding and finance is available for end-users. While office development
continues apace in Manila's business districts of Makati and Ortigas, there are
also signs of growth in the pocket development north of Metro Manila. Says
Citibank's Poland: "The question is whether in two or three years time [Manila]
will be overbuilt. The question then will be whether there are enough companies
relocating to Manila. I seriously doubt it."

<P> <B>Malaysia</B>

<P> Tighter monetary policy, which has cooled Malaysia's economy, has also put a
curb on the property market.

<P> Malaysia's residential property sales index, produced by Malayan Banking
Corporation and the Rating Agency of Malaysia, rose from 100 to 163.86 points
from 1994 to the end of the second quarter of this year, but fell in the second
quarter as the government's credit tightening measures came into force.

<P> Government curbs include a M$100,000 ($40,000) levy on property purchases by
foreigners and an increase in property gains tax to a range of between 15% and
30% for residents and a flat 30% for non-residents.

<P> At Crosby Research in Kuala Lumpur, property analyst Lynne Chiang is cautious
about the high-end residential market, particularly in the context of government
restrictions on foreign purchases, and over-supply in the sector for the last two
years. Chiang is also worried about the latest Malaysian bandwagon of bungalow
lots &#173; high cost second home resorts. Medium-cost residential property,
however, is still looking good, supported by domestic demand. But, says Chiang:
"We don't have any screaming buys. Everyone is waiting for the cycle to slow
down."

<P> The commercial property market is less healthy as over-supply poses a major
problem. Although a number of businesses are moving from older buildings to newer
offices, tempted by incentives such as rent-free periods and reduced service
charges, Crosby sees occupancy rates falling from a current level of 90% to
around 85%.

<P> <B>Thailand </B>

<P> Thailand's property developers have not had an easy ride this year. The
marked slowdown of the economy and a massive drop in the stock market have
squeezed many firms to the brink of collapse. Small-scale residential developers
have been hardest hit, but bigger players are also struggling.

<P> But office construction continues and this is likely to add to the market's
problems in the future. The residential sector has remained static because of
oversupply. Bank of Thailand measures to keep a rein on inflation and liquidity
have also hit the property market, especially its curb on lending for property
development.

<P> The industry has also been rattled by the arrest of Prasong Panitpakdee,
managing director of listed Somprasong Land, who, now out on bail, has been
accused of falsifying financial statements. He has yet to plead. Commentators
believe there is widespread fiddling by many property companies. The most popular
scam is to book down-payments for houses as completed sales.

<P> Lack of cash flow is also causing problems for property companies' debt
repayments, and this is likely to have a knock-on effect on the country's banks
and finance companies, a number of which are linked to their borrowers through
family groups.

<P> Among the troubled property companies, Rattana Real Estate and Country
(Thailand) faces delisting from the Stock Exchange of Thailand after reporting
losses for three consecutive years. Even Land and Houses, one of the country's
strongest developers, reported a 15.7% drop in third quarter profit to Baht437
million ($17 million).

<P> Thai authorities have spent the year devising ways to stimulate the property
market, including a proposal to allow for listed property trusts. The latest plan
is to create a secondary mortgage corporation, majority owned by the government,
which would enable lenders to sell their portfolios in the event of a liquidity
crisis. But setting up a committee, and drafting the necessary legislation could
be a lengthy process.

<P>

<H3> China's two-tier market </H3> 

<P> The old Chinese rule of
thumb is: keep a third of your wealth in property, a third in gold and a third in
cash. But that maxim could be thrown on its head as foreign investors start to
circle the markets of Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou.

<P> Hong Kong property companies, led by the listed Henderson Land spin-off,
Henderson China, are making serious investments in the People's Republic of
China. This is a growth market as foreign companies set up business in China and
look for office and residential space. Research by Morgan Stanley estimates
demand for additional office space at 70 million square feet in Shanghai and 60
million square feet in Beijing. But it is becoming a two-tier market: in Shanghai
rental and capital values of poor quality buildings are falling as prospective
tenants become more discerning.

<P> China's transition to the free market is not over yet and Morgan Stanley
sounds a note of caution: "The property market in China is a relatively new
phenomenon, with, as yet, a less-than-well established legal planning and
regulatory framework; and what framework there is may be changed in the future."

<P> Foreign developers such as Henderson China are selling most of their property
to foreign buyers, usually in US or HK dollars. Henderson China reported net
profit of HK$564 million for the full year to June 1996, with an estimated HK$477
million derived from office and residential sales at the Beijing Henderson
Centre, where prices average HK$2,560 (US$330) per square foot. Henderson China's
property portfolio is valued at around HK$12.5 billion, with 22 projects signed
and under construction or clearance. But, warns Morgan Stanley, the property
market for foreign buyers is finite. Long-term success will depend on the ability
to sell to the local market.

Recommendation:  Long GBP versus CHF <BR>                                      
Take Profit: CHF 2.33<BR>
<P>

Trying to establish underlying currency trends around the turn of the year is always dangerous due to the lack of liquidity in most markets and consequent scope for erratic and meaningless swings in prices.  However, it does seem that the appetite to short the low cost currencies remains intact.  The CHF has already given up considerable ground over the last few weeks, but we see room for further declines before the unit stands any realistic chance of a recovery.  This week's employment report should see offer additional proof of what should again be the worst performing European economy in 1997.  Indeed, it is significant that despite the slide in the CHF, local interest rates have fallen recently in response to the ongoing downturn in the domestic activity.  It costs nearly nothing to sell the currency and with the SNB clearly delighted with the unit's fall, there is minimal risk of any policy inspired reversal.  At the same time, UK data continue to point to an already robust economy that is still gaining momentum.  The pre-Xmas current account figures were reassuring and interest rates are on the up soon - quite possibly next week.  Monetary tightening may well be discounted in the futures market, but confirmation should still leave the GBP all the more attractive on a yield spread basis.  The outlook for a stronger USD should also have beneficial knock-on effects for the UK currency.

<li>USD to make additional headway against the JPY and Europe on sustained low BoJ interest rates and hopes for a mini BBK ease.  However, USD-JPY now well into politically dangerous territory and very vulnerable to any hint of BoJ tightening.  USD-DEM good for DEM1.60, but needs confidence in the EMU process and stability in US asset markets. 
<li>DEM downside favoured within the EMS, but scope for additional weakness limited with the BBK now indicating contentment with current extent of correction. 
<li>GBP a near term buy below DEM2.65, with good medium term upside potential to DEM2.70.   Politics still messy, but election likely to be of only limited importance and relative fundamentals attractive enough to accommodate at least a degree of overshooting.
<li>CHF to continue to weaken despite recent sharp adjustment.  Cross to test 88 centime level soon, 90 on the cards before mid-year.

<li>Fed policy on hold and no change expected at next (February 4-5) FOMC meeting.  However, pick-up in the recent data increases the risk of a tightening in 1H97, especially if the stock market continues to perform strongly.
<li>BBK policy expected steady for now, but signs of renewed weakness in the 4Q96 economy and absence of inflation pressures to provide room for small repo cut this quarter.
<li>BoE rate hike still favoured at next Clarke/George meeting on January 15, but risk of no change if government opts for an early election.
<li>Other European interest rates on hold for now, but still good medium term rate cut potential in Italy, Spain and to a lesser extent, Sweden.

<li>US Treasury market bias down on signs that the 4Q96 economy was stronger than originally expected and consequent renewed concerns about Fed tightening.  However, upcoming inflation data expected friendly and December employment report will have to be genuinely strong to induce tightening speculation at the February FOMC meeting. 
<li>Bunds to outperform Treasuries on favourable domestic economic data and rate cut hopes.  However, heavy 1Q96 supply schedule a drag and EMU convergence trades a negative.   
<li>Higher yielders still favoured medium term over hard core EMS, but vulnerable to any USD downturn and BTPs in need of a rate cut soon to avoid serious disappointment.
<li>Gilt market still expected to struggle until next rate hike out of the way and inflation picture becomes brighter.  Medium term bund spread target of 200 remains in place.

<b>BankAmerica Third Quarter Earnings</b><br>

San Francisco, 16 October       <br>    

BankAmerica Corporation reported third quarter 1996
earnings per share and net income of $1.75 and $683 million respectively,
compared with $1.72 and $704 million for the same period a year ago. Third
quarter net income includes a one-time assessment of $82 million associated with
the recapitalization of the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). Excluding
the effect of this assessment, earnings per share and net income for the third
quarter would have been $1.88 and $731 million respectively, which would
represent increases of 9 percent and 4 percent compared with the same period a
year ago. In addition, the return on average common equity for the third quarter
of 1996, excluding the SAIF assessment, would have been 15.23 percent, an
increase of 14 basis points from the same period a year ago. <br>

David A Coulter, Chairman and CEO, said "Once again, we had a very solid quarter.
Credit quality continued to improve, expenses remained under control and we began
to make progress in our efforts toward strategic redeployment of capital." <br>

<b>More than 85,000 BankAmerica employees receive stock options </b><br>

BankAmerica implemented one of the largest and most

including most hourly and part-time workers - option to between 50 and 90 shares
of BankAmerica Corporation common stock every six months over the next three
years. "Take Ownership!" was unveiled by Chairman and CEO David Coulter in a live
satellite broadcast to employees worldwide. Coulter said that a key goal of the
program is to enhance service to Bank of America customers. <br>

<b> BankAmerica fourth quarter restructuring charge </b><br>

San Francisco, 12 December  <br>

BankAmerica Corporation said that it will take a
pre-tax charge of $280 million as the result of decisions to implement a number
of restructurings of its business activities. The charge will result in an
after-tax effect on net income of approximately $165 million in the fourth
quarter of 1996. <br>

David A. Coulter, Chairman and CEO said "As we have previously indicated, our
capital allocation strategy calls for ongoing review of our businesses and staff
units to find ways to operate more efficiently and to use our capital more
productively. The restructuring charge reflects the latest decisions resulting
from this on-going review process." The charge will cover severance payments,
premises and other costs in wholesale and retail banking and in staff support
areas.

<P> The laws of Pakistan are very liberal towards foreign direct or portfolio investment. A
foreign national can now own up to 100% equity in a company and is free to repatriate
his capital, capital gains as well as dividends, whenever he feels like.
Government permission is not required for investment in manufacturing concerns.

<blockquote>
<ul>
The International Bond Congress is a unique event in the financial calendar.  It provides an opportunity for all fixed income professionals - investors, issuers, salesforces, traders, economists, analysts, origination and syndication officials and information providers - to come together for two days in London to discuss developments in the bond markets.
<br><br>
The International Bond Congress has become the premier event of its kind.  Over 5,000 delegates have attended the previous two congresses in October 1994 and September 1995, representing the broadest possible spectrum of bond market participants.
<br><br>
The combination of a conference - with top name plenary speakers, panel discussions and workshops - together with an Expo with dedicated stands, hospitality suites and meeting areas, gives delegates the opportunity not only to benefit from in-depth analysis of bond market trends but also to meet an unrivalled gathering of clients, potential clients and peers in an informal environment.
<br><br>
With the experience gained from the previous congresses, this year's event - to take place on Tuesday 25 and Wednesday 26 February 1997 - promises to be the most successful to date.  The venue will be the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, London.
<br><br>
The Congress will also offer bond market professionals the chance to help set the agenda in what promises to be one of the most exciting and challenging eras in the history of the fixed income markets.  The range of products available to portfolio managers is growing all the time - for example credit derivatives, repos and strips - and investors are increasingly turning towards higher-yielding paper from corporates and emerging markets as interest rates remain at historic lows. 
<br><br>
The biggest potential change to the bond markets of all - European Monetary Union - looms ever larger.  Less than two years away from the date of the Congress Europes bond markets may change for ever.
<br><br>
These issues will be explained in detail in the workshops and also in panel discussions involving leading economists, issuers, traders, regulators and investors.
<br><br></ul>
<font size=4><b>The Conference</b></font>
<ul>
Delegates will have full access to all the speeches and workshops on both days of the conference.  The conference consists of three plenary sessions, with a keynote address and panel discussions on both mornings and a further panel discussion on the first afternoon, as well as a closing address on the second afternoon.
<br><br>
After each morning plenary session the Conference will split into streams of four parallel workshops which will cover specific market topics, together with a fifth stream on information technology services.  There will be a total of 32 sponsors' workshops.  Each presentation will last for 50 minutes enabling speakers to provide comprehensive coverage of their subjects.
<br><br></ul>
<font size=4><b>The Exhibition</b></font>
<ul>
The major suppliers to the bond market will exhibit their products and services at the Congress.  As well as sponsoring institutions these will include information, systems and software providers, credit rating agencies, clearing services, risk management experts and futures and options exchanges.  It provides an opportunity to try out many of the products and gain first-hand experience.
<br><br></ul>
<font size=4><b>Private Meetings</b></font>
<ul>
Many of the sponsors will be holding private meetings for delegates with leading economists and strategists, members of central banks, debt offices, ministries of finance and borrowers in their hospitality suites.  In addition to these meetings, the suites offer an excellent opportunity to welcome existing and new counterparties.  It provides an excellent opportunity to learn about new markets and the services offered by the sponsors.
<br><br></ul>
<font size=4><b>To Register</b></font>
<ul>
<b>Conference & Exhibition</b><br>
Fee-paying delegates will have access to both the conference and exhibition, as well as to the central meeting areas, refreshments, documentation and a cocktail reception at the end of the first evening.  The cost is 495 + VAT for delegates registering before December 13 and 595 + VAT thereafter.
<br><br>
<b>However, fixed-income investors will be able to attend both the conference and exhibition as complimentary guests of the sponsors.</b>
<br><br>
<b>Exhibition Only </b><br>
Pre-registered visitors can visit the exhibition and hospitality suites, giving them the opportunity to meet counterparties and potential clients or learn more about the sponsoring and exhibiting institutions.  Exhibition visitors will also have refreshments and will be invited to the cocktail reception at the end of the first evening but will not have access to the conference sessions.

<font size=4><b>The 1995 Event</b></font>
<ul>
The Second Euromoney International Bond Congress staged at the Barbican, London, attracted 2,650 attendees from 50 different countries.
<br><br>
The conference featured three plenary speakers Urban Backstrom, Michael Bloomberg and Sir Alan Walters. The keynote speakers included Desmond Fitzgerald, Gerald Holtham, Giles Keating and Eduardo Schwartz.
<br><br>
Sponsors and exhibitors who participated in the Expo reported many new, high quality contacts and excellent business leads. Exhibiting companies made use of this high profile event to launch new products and services, as well as a means to gain important exposure for their particular areas of expertise. Bloomberg coincided the introduction of their new 'Open' system with the event. Merita Bank used the event as a launch pad for their new corporate name. Some companies used the marketing potential of their stands to the full; Nordbanken, for example, organised a television and press conference with Urban Backstrom - the Governor of the Swedish Central Bank.
<br><br>
The Expo has clearly become an excellent opportunity to meet the key players in the market as well as being the vehicle for pursuing a range of business and marketing objectives - launching products, instruments and services, increasing corporate awareness and investigating new markets.

DG Bank is a corporation under public law and the central financial institution
of the German cooperative banking system, which forms one of the most close-knit
banking networks in Europe. The network provides a broad range of financial
services from retail banking via the over 2,500 local cooperative banks
(Volksbanken, Raiffeisenbanken) to fund management, insurance, etc.
<BR>
<BR>
With a balance-sheet-total of some DEM 300 bn (December 31, 1995) and over 10,000
employees in its Frankfurt headquarters and a number of branches and offices in
Germany and key financial centers all over the world, DG BANK is one of the top 10
banks in Germany. As a universal bank it offers both classical financial and innovative
tailor-made solutions to a broad range of financing problems to the members of
the network and to other institutional clients. Its capital market activities
make DG BANK one of the major players in the DEM sector.

<H3>13-17 January, Weekly commentary</CENTER></H3>

<blockquote>
Last week, the dollar bulls roared as the bullish sentiment finally led to some
USD purchases by institutional investors. The USD's rise was helped by the
weakness of the DM in Europe which was the result of renewed interest rate
speculation after the rather weak employment data. In contrast, strong US
employment data were perceived in the market as raising the odds for a rate hike
in mid-March. US-data this week (CPI, industrial production, trade) might dampen
this speculation somewhat. Furthermore, the USD would have to overcome the strong
resistance zone between DM 1,5850-1,6100 to clear the way for further gains. We
do not expect this to happen, at least not yet. Also, the DM's weakness in Europe
should not be taken much further as Central banks have already begun to
intervene.

<blockquote>
The bund future broke the psychological resistance of 100 and stabilised well
above. This week's highlight: release of IFO business climate for December, which
should show a slight increase towards year end. Wholesale prices and retail
figures (both for December) will not have a major impact on the market. In the
US, investors should focus on the release (Tuesday) of December retail figures
and CPI data. Retail turnover should have risen significantly. Corresponding to
the recently published PPI data, consumer prices should show an increase of 0.3%
with an even smaller increase in the core rate. In contrast, capacity utilisation
and industrial production to be released on Friday might be a burden for the
market if they confirm investor's expectations of higher economic growth.

<blockquote>
At the beginning of the new year the surprisingly good US economic data
re-ignited inflation fears and the subsequent weakness on Wall Street caused
German share prices to drop, too. In view of prevailing uncertainties, new
purchases should only be made on slow days. The first reports on companies'
results in the past business year will come out from mid-January on. At present,
we do not recommend investments in companies with a strong domestic base, in
particular in consumption and construction as we do not rule out further declines
in this sector. We continue to favor automobile and chemical stocks, as these
should profit strongly from the current export boom and the ongoing weakness of
the DM.

Bank Austria was created in October 1991 with the merger of Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG (at that time the second largest Austrian commercial bank) and Zentralsparkasse und Kommerzialbank, Wien AG  (Austria's largest savings bank). <br><br>
The merger resulted in the creation of the largest financial institution in Austria with a market share of between 12 and 20 percent. Bank Austria ranks 121 in a listing amongst the world's top 200 banks (EUROMONEY, June 1996). <br><br>
Bank Austria is Austria's leading bank in the retail banking, corporate banking, investment banking and treasury sectors. <br><br>
The bank's economic strength and significance are reflected in international ratings. Due to its excellent capitalization (own funds in relation to risk volumes weighted amount to 10,3%, about 3/4 thereof as tier I capital), its earnings potential and the assumption of the bank's liabilities by the City of Vienna, Bank Austria  - as the only commercial bank in Austria belongs to an exclusive group of banks which has been awarded a "Aaa" rating by Moody's. Global Finance ranked Bank Austria 17th based on a comparable rating of the world's 250 safest banks. <br><br>
The bank has won international recognition for the high quality of its services. EUROMONEY recently named Bank Austria "Best Bank in Austria" and "Best Security Firm in Austria" - as it did for 1993, 1994 and 1995. <br><br>
Bank Austria's success has not gone unnoticed abroad. After thorough analysis of the Austrian market, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (West LB) signed a cooperation agreement with Bank Austria in December 1995. This strategic alliance, in which WestLB took a 9.1% interest in the bank's share capital by way of a capital increase effected in spring 1996, is without a doubt a milestone in the history of Bank Austria. Each institution has declared the other to be its preferred partner for cross-border financial transactions focusing primarily on foreign commercial transactions, foreign money transfers, currency clearing, the securities business, investment banking and business in Central and Eastern Europe. It should also be mentioned in  this regard, that Cariplo, Bank Austria's large Italian shareholder, further increased its holdings in Bank Austria to the agreed-upon 5.6%.

Bank Austria is not only the driving force behind the Austrian banking industry, but also a major <b>regional player on all international markets</b> where the institutional and geographical advantages offered by the Austrian financial market can be utilized by the bank.
<br><br>
Because of Austria's history and geographical location, Bank Austria sees itself as a Central European institution with a strong focus on the neighboring Central and Eastern European countries. 
<br><br>
Its location in the heart of Europe and the expertise of its predecessor banks in East-West trade are particular strengths which the bank brings to bear on its international operations. In 1992, for example, Bank Austria became the first foreign bank to receive a banking license to operate a branch in Moscow. It has subsidiaries in Switzerland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary and Slovenia. 
<br><br>
The bank maintains branches in the world's leading financial centers (New York, London, Hongkong, Singapore) as well as representative offices in  most countries in Western and Eastern Europe and in the Far East.

<H2>MY CENTURY </H2>
<H4><I>T</I>he 20th century is about to end, a blink in time when humankind
searched for revolutionary means of self-enrichment and discovered instead
the means of self-destruction, writes Nadime Gordimer </H4>
In terms of human life, 100 years is the largest unit we can grasp: after
that, quantification begins again. It is not without significance that life
is renewed in Sleeping Beauty's family castle after this span. The turn
of a century is the prince's kiss of time. On the first morning of the year
2000 the world will be awakened to a new calendar, perhaps a new life. <BR>
<BR>
Living in the 20th century, we cannot look upon it from the pretence of
another perspective; nor should we try to if we are to discover what only
we know best, if only secretly: the truth about ourselves and our time.
The brief conception of our century I propose here is inevitably subjective:
each of you will substitute or add your own, but there are surely many which
we share, shaped by the same period. <BR>
<BR>
At once there arises from a flash brighter than a thousand suns the mushroom
cloud that hangs over our century. Exploded almost exactly at the half-century
mark, the atomic bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki rise as unsurpassed
evil done by human decision. This in a century where more humans have been
killed or allowed to die of starvation and disease than ever before in history
and where the Nazi holocaust, 50 years on, has become as much the household
word of horror as ethnic cleansing in the Balkans and Africa. <BR>
<BR>
Foremost of the &quot;firsts&quot; our century can claim is that for the
first time man invented a power of destruction which surpasses any natural
catastrophe &shyp; earthquake, volcano, flood. Thus the final conquest of
nature, an aim pursued with the object of human benefit since the invention
of agriculture in the Stone Age, has been achieved in our discovery of how
to wipe ourselves out more quickly and efficiently than any force of nature.
The demonic vow of our century seems to come from Virgil: &quot;If I cannot
move Heaven, I will stir up Hell&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Treating weapons as toys </B><BR>
<BR>
The signing of a nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is brokered among nations
and the threat of an atomic war, which for 40 years depended on the press
of a button in the Pentagon or Kremlin, is complacently half-forgotten since
one protagonist in a Cold War is <I>hors de combat</I>. But the French have
been trying out their nuclear capacity as if these loathsome apocalyptic
weapons were now old toys a safe world can play with. The prediction of
poet TS Eliot was that we would end with a whimper; our own is that we could
go out with a bang. The mushroom cloud still hangs over us: will it be there
as a bequest to the new century? <BR>
<BR>
The strange relation between the forces of Good and Evil has been part of
the mystery of human existence since we evolved as the only self-regarding
creatures in the animal world. With the great leaps that have been made
into what was formerly beyond human experience, the relation surely has
become more profoundly relevant and inexplicable than ever. Einstein, exiled
from his home country by the evil force of Nazism, deciphered one of the
greatest secrets of nature and split the atom. What was intended to enrich
humankind with an extension of knowledge of its cosmic existence produced
out of Good the malediction of our time: atomic capability. <BR>
<BR>
What is more puzzling, and far more trouble, is an apparent symbiosis of
Good and Evil, passing from one into the other through some transparency
we cannot fathom. We try to apply moral precepts to processes that function
according to quite other laws, laws in which morality does not exist at
all: a sober contemplation for an age characterised by revolutionary scientific
discovery. <BR>
<BR>
If we turn away from the absolutes of opposing Good and Evil, as we must
see them if human values are to survive, we come to the lower level, that
of paradox. We have made spectacular advances in discoveries that have made
life more bearable for some and more pleasurable for others. We have eliminated
many epidemics and alleviated pain with new drugs; we have raised the dead
in a real sense, by taking vital organs and planting them to function again
in the living. <BR>
<BR>
Aircraft have revolutionised the possibility of physical presence. The bundle
of telecommunications &shyp; computer, fax, email, cellular phone &shyp;
has speeded up communication by the spoken and written word. We have lifted
the burden of manual workers and housewives by machines programmed to do
onerous tasks: with other devices we have brought music and moving images
into every house. We have broken the sound barrier, explored space and entered
the angels' realm, the sphere of the heavens. Most of us have enjoyed some
of these embellishments of life. <BR>
<BR>
The Italian Futurist painters in the early decades of our age depicted a
world of sleek cars whirling unhampered through streets, planes buzzing
like happy bees, gathering the nectar of a new age between skyscrapers and
rainbows in a radiantly clear sky. <BR>
<BR>
Their paintings look to us now like the work of a Grandma Moses of industrialisation,
yet we shared their innocent ignorance of pollution and lacked, as they
did, the true vision of a future: which was that we would begin to choke
on our technological progress, suffocate in our cities in our own foul breath
of fumes and carcinogenic vapours. We have achieved much, but we have not
always stayed at the controls of purpose. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The ordeal of dread banished </B><BR>
<BR>
It is also intriguing to observe how technology has intervened in the intangible,
telescoping our emotions. Those antipodean states, dread and anticipation,
have been practically outdated. The ordeal of dread is banished by instant
full communication from anywhere to anywhere. Anticipation has become instant
gratification. So, not for the first or last time, the advances of technology
contradict theories of human satisfaction expounded by the savants of that
advance in knowledge that has dramatically distinguished our century, psychoanalysis.
Apart from its purely sexual application, Sigmund Freud's deferred pleasure
as a refinement of emotional experience does not compare with the immediate
joy of hearing a lover's voice, or getting a friend's reply to a letter
at once by email. <BR>
<BR>
Even adventurism has been transformed by technology. The intrepid now walk
on the moon and dangle in space instead of &quot;discovering&quot; jungles
and rivers that the indigenous inhabitants have known as home since the
time pinpointed by their personal creation myths. Through weightlessness,
the new adventurers actually experience extinction while still alive, becoming
phantoms whose feet cannot touch earth. They are the successors to the angels
in whom we no longer believe because we have probed outer space and found
no heaven. <BR>
<BR>
Technology is the means by which one of the positive, progressive consequences
of this century's revolutions &shyp; a determination to break open the elitism
of the arts &shyp; has been made practical. From the era of actors' troupes
and exhibitions travelling through the villages of Russia after the October
Revolution, to this decade of the '90s when even squatter camps in Africa,
India, or the Middle East have transistor radios, culture in its most easily
assimilable form has been democratised. Technology has redistributed intellectual
privilege. <BR>
<BR>
Music from pop to opera has been brought to the masses by discs and broadcasts
which may be heard on the humblest of radios. And by the same means, an
appreciation of the musical forms of the east and Africa, from the <I>ragas</I>
of Ravi Shankar to South Africa's <I>kwela</I> and <I>mbaganga</I>, have
spread internationally. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Watching replaces the real thing </B><BR>
<BR>
But it is television that has brought about the overwhelming cultural transformation.
Television has altered human perception and changed the means of knowing
and receiving the world. Of the five senses, sight now outstrips all others;
watching is the primary form of comprehension. Although television speaks,
it is its endless stream of images out of which the child, the youth and
even the mature and old construct reality. The visual other-world of television
is renewed like a palimpsest day after day, for millions the last vision
before sleep and the first woken to in the morning. <BR>
<BR>
Every workshop of young painters in my country show strikingly the imprinting
of artists' creativity by television's imagery and iconography, its visual
hierarchy of what is meaningful in our life. Television has empowered the
visual far beyond the capacity of cinema, the art which democratised enjoyment
of leisure before the television box entered our homes. Through television,
the service of technology to art developed in our century, we have produced
a human mutation that substitutes vicarious experience for the real thing.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In our time the destiny of man presents its meaning in political terms,&quot;
wrote Thomas Mann, who interpreted human experience through his own personal
experience of the century's physical displacements and upheavals of perception.
But we are not only children of our time, we are also of our place. My own
consciousness and subconscious comes from a destiny shaped by the historico-political
matrix into which I was born. My personal sense of the defining events of
our century is dominated by two such events: the fall of communism and the
end of colonialism. And the two are linked subjectively, even contradictorily.
<BR>
<BR>
I was born a second-generation colonial in a capitalist-racist society.
As I grew up I looked to the left as the solution to the oppression of the
poor and powerless all around me, at home and abroad. When I was a toddler
I was taken to wave a flag at the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VIII,
on his visit to the British dominion of South Africa. I was told again and
again as I grew up of this momentous occasion, with a sense of values to
be inculcated: loyalty in homage to imperial power. <BR>
<BR>
Nobody mentioned the fact that the Indian leader Mohandas Gandhi had developed
his philosophy in the country where I was born and was to live my life:
a man who was to leave behind principles of non-violent liberation that
were to be important to the struggle for freedom by black people, unacknowledged
by the values of the whites. <BR>
<BR>
It has become a truism to shake one's head in wonder at the end of apartheid
and the emergence of a free South Africa. But it was indeed a miracle and
it came at the time when a new miracle was needed to compensate for the
flickering of the Red Star, that miracle promised in the first quarter of
the century. <BR>
<BR>
Human beings will always believe in the possibility of a better world of
their own making. In the words of Jean-Paul Sartre, socialism was seen as
&quot;man in the process of creating himself&quot;. It is a sense of abandonment
that the collapse of the Soviet Union brings to our century among those
to whom the ideals of socialism remain, rather than the disillusion many
in the west would triumphantly claim. <BR>
<BR>
For whatever one's judgement of its consequences, the most momentous single
date in the social organisation of our century was the October Revolution:
one third of humankind found itself living under regimes derived from that
event. Has the disintegration of the Soviet world before the end of the
same century brought the triumph of democracy? Perhaps it is only the return
of the liberalism that failed, after World War I, to prevent the people
of Italy and Germany from turning to fascism as the solution of their straightened
circumstances, a condition which exists again in many parts of our world
today. <BR>
<BR>
In South Africa, the left's revelation of the class and economic basis of
racial discrimination was one of the formative influences that, along with
Pan-Africanism, joined a natural national will towards liberation. The other
formative influence is the one mentioned above, Gandhi. He was one of the
truly great individuals of our century whose lifetime we set against the
monsters, from Hitler to Pol Pot, whom the century has produced. Gandhi
was an original thinker on the nature of power, as distinct from power confined
to the purely political tool for liberation, yet able to serve this tool
as part of a high moral consciousness. His philosophy of <I>satyagraha</I>
&quot;the force which is born of truth and love&quot;, is perhaps the only
genuine spiritual advance in an era of religious decline marked by crackpot
distortions of faith and savage fundamentalism. <BR>
<BR>
What Gandhi began, out of a philosophy formulated in South Africa and applied
tactically in India to bring about freedom from imperial rule, Nelson Mandela
has concluded. For Mandela's prestige and honour in the world today is recognition
not only of his achievement in the defeat of the dire experiment in social
engineering called apartheid. It is recognition that other ghastly forms
of social engineering tried in our century were defeated where they had
taken refuge, for apartheid with its blatant racist laws was an avatar of
Nazism. And finally, it is homage paid to Mandela in recognition that at
stake was something far greater than the fate of a single country; it was
final victory gained for humankind over centuries-old bondage of colonisation.
<BR>
<BR>
The sum of our century may be looked at in a number of ways: the wars that
were fought, the military defeats that turned into economic victories, the
ideologies that rose and fell, the technology that telescoped time and distance.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Write oil on the window of time </B><BR>
<BR>
We could dip a finger in a dark viscous substance and write on the window
of our time &quot;oil&quot;. Oil became more precious than gold: it has
been the &quot;why&quot; of many wars of our day. Repressive regimes go
unreproached by democratic countries who are dependent on them for oil;
men, women and children die for oil without knowing why. <BR>
<BR>
In intimate human relations, we have won sexual freedom and lost it &shyp;
to Aids. Freud changed emotional cognition and self-perception. Another
kind of perception moved from Picasso's <I>Guernica</I> to Andy Warhol's
Campbell's Soup can, to the Reichstag wrapped in plastic, illustrating our
cycles: worship of force, worship of materialism, the desire to cover up
and forget the choices we have made. <BR>
<BR>
Now that the deeds are done &shyp; the 100 years ready to seal what will
be recorded of us &shyp; our last achievement could be in the spirit of
taking up, in Jawaharlal Nehru's words, &quot;the ceaseless adventure of
man&quot; which is control of our achievements, questioning honestly and
reflecting upon the truth of what has been lived through. There is no other
base on which to found the 21st century with the chance to make it a better
one.* <BR>

<H4>The changes of recent years have altered the face of South Africa's
industrial and financial powerhouse, Gautang province, which includes Johannesburg
and the capital Pretoria. National problems have a special impact here,
so recent foreign scepticism about government policy and the fall of the
rand have hit hard. But there are already signs of returning business confidence
and hope for the future <BR>

<B>There are signs of an up-turn in business activity but the region must
tackle the same problems as the country <BR>
<BR>
</B><I>By Marek Garztecki <BR>
<BR>
</I>&quot;If you want to [sense] the state of the economy of South Africa
you will get it in Gauteng. It is the best barometer. If the business climate
here is depressed you will generally find it depressed in the rest of the
country. Gauteng is already the New York of Southern Africa,&quot; declares
Pieter van Huyssteen, the chief executive of PW Corporate Finance, a member
firm of the international Price Waterhouse group. <BR>
<BR>
The increasing activity of his company, located right in the middle of Gauteng
in a leafy suburb of Johannesburg, suggests that after a long period of
stormy weather the local business climate is beginning to recover. <BR>
<BR>
Whether it can be insulated from national trends is another matter. Industrial
strife, exchange controls and a controversial new finance minister sent
the rand plunging to its lowest level against the dollar in April. Market
sentiment is sceptical of the government's ability to restrain public spending
and prevent future currency outflows. <BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, like the rest of South Africa Gauteng has reaped some benefits
from the remarkable political and economic changes of the past six years
since the end of apartheid and the formation of President Nelson Mandela's
government of national unity. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The return to planet Earth <BR>
<BR>
</B>While the new South Africa was able to re-enter the world political
arena almost immediately, economic progress was far slower. &quot;Five years
ago only the brave moved into South Africa,&quot; reflects Collin Wright,
head of the privately sponsored International Resource Centre in Johannesburg.
&quot;Most adopted the 'wait and see' attitude. Some of the companies that
divested from South Africa [during the sanctions era] were not encouraged
to study country's economic potential, they thought it futile if they could
not follow it with investment and a presence here. They lost track.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Wright, who doubles as the director of commerce and industry for Greater
Johannesburg Metropolitan Council, has spent a great part of the past few
years travelling around the world, meeting businessmen and decision-makers
in an effort to preach his gospel. &quot;Johannesburg has a very interesting
economy,&quot; he says, &quot;it has one of the most diversified economies
that you will find in any one metropolitan area in the world. It is almost
a national economy in its own right.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Pretoria, the country's political centre and Johannesburg, its commercial
centre, constitute the bulk of Gauteng province. Although it constitutes
just 1.5% of the country's land area, Gauteng contains almost 20% of its
population and accounts for nearly 40% of South African GDP. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;If Gauteng was a country it would have the third largest economy in
Africa, after the rump of South Africa and Algeria,&quot; says Philip Clayton,
senior economist with the Standard Bank of South Africa. &quot;It would
be bigger than Nigeria, bigger than Kenya, in fact bigger than any other
country in Africa you care to mention. Gauteng is the financial, manufacturing,
retailing powerhouse of South Africa and indeed of the whole continent.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The province has considerable powers. According to Andrew Feinstein, a member
of the Provincial Legislature and the chairman of its Economic Affairs Committee,
the post-apartheid authorities intended the new provincial arrangement to
enhance local self-government. &quot;The provinces have a very important
role to play. One example is small business development. We have almost
no culture of small business. We have a national enabling act and provincial
acts that deal with the circumstances of each province,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
The promotion, spearheaded by the indefatigable Collin Wright, eventually
drew an international response. The first came from European countries with
historical ties to South Africa such as Germany and Holland: France and
Italy also joined. Not that the Germans ever left: Car firms like BMW and
Volkswagen stayed throughout the sanctions period unlike most US firms.
<BR>
<BR>
Less traditional investors have also arrived. There have been 75 trade delegations
from mainland China and as a result about 20 companies and joint ventures
were set up with total investment of almost 1 billion Rand ($225 million).
They cover a wide range of products from the arms industry to electronics.
There is also substantial property investment from east Asia. <BR>
<BR>
The return of the British, once the country's colonial rulers, took the
form of huge investments on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), multiplying
its trading volume in the process (see page 67). Although some expressed
misgivings because of fears of speculative behaviour, the JSE executive
president RC Andersen has welcomed the trend. &quot;Foreign money may easy
come and easy go,&quot; he acknowledges, &quot;but it forces discipline
on local politicians and businessmen, making sure that they are fiscally
responsible and maintain monetary discipline.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Where first and third worlds meet <BR>
<BR>
</B>Whatever their entry strategy, Collin Wright believes that an increasing
number of foreign investors are convinced that South Africa offers opportunities.
It has a good infrastructure and operates as a modern economy, providing
a good base on which to build. <BR>
<BR>
Philip Clayton concurs: &quot;Our electronic banking systems are among the
best in the world and the services that we can provide to corporate clients
are on par. The technical skills may not be up to west European standards
but are certainly far superior to those available in African countries.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Most people think of South Africa in terms of Third World economies,&quot;
complains Wright, &quot;but it has islands of brilliance in high-tech knowledge
which need to be commercialised. For example, in the jewellery industry
we have developed the first ever 24-carat hard-gold technology. We can produce
24-carat gold at the hardness of 9-carat gold.&quot; Wright concedes that
finding niche markets in which value could be added locally, such as platinum
enrichment, is a real challenge. <BR>
<BR>
During the period of sanctions in the jewellery and diamond industry a lot
of activity moved out of South Africa to Hong Kong and New York. The local
authorities are trying to entice it back. Recently a &quot;jewel city&quot;
was opened in downtown Johannesburg, intended as a value-added centre. Some
250 companies have already located there. <BR>
<BR>
While the international boycott lasted, internal industrialisation was spurred
by the need to manufacture import replacements. Now that the local market
is opening up to the outside world two things can happen. &quot;The existing
industrial base can be killed off by the international competition or, if
you give enough advantage to international players to enter into joint ventures,
it may serve as a base for exports into the rest of Africa as well as other
markets,&quot; Wright says. <BR>
<BR>
<B>As good production, if not better <BR>
<BR>
</B>Joint ventures aimed at updating local technology, in areas ranging
from battery manufacture to pumps and valves, give some hope that the second
option will prevail. Foreign manufacturers assembling in South Africa, such
as Land Rover, substantially increased local content when they realised
that its quality not only equals but in some cases surpasses the levels
of some developed countries. <BR>
<BR>
South Africa is now becoming a focal point for African industrial machinery
buyers. African trade missions that would once have gone to Europe now go
to Johannesburg first. <BR>
<BR>
Gauteng is also the main regional transport hub. Some 97% of all South African
air freight enters via Johannesburg and over 50% of all the ship freight
that comes to southern African ports ends up here for redistribution. <BR>
<BR>
But this also adds to social and crime problems. &quot;As the markets open,
so enters international crime and all the social ills,&quot; complains one
politician. He accuses neighbouring countries of a failure to control their
own criminal element, which he alleges heads for &quot;the honey-pot of
the continent&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Others say crime is predominantly home-grown. &quot;The biggest problem
locally is the high unemployment level. Unofficial figures suggest that
about half the black population lacks formal job opportunities. If you do
not have a job or prospects of finding it, you start getting involved in
criminal activities. This is something that we have to focus on before anything
else,&quot; says Wright. <BR>
<BR>
During the past few years, formerly exclusive white areas such as Hillbrow
and Berea have been virtually taken over by poor blacks. In cosy white suburbs
stories abound about violent attacks and &quot;no-go areas&quot;. All the
same, wanton, racially motivated attacks of the sort that occur in &quot;civilised&quot;
European capitals are virtually unknown. <BR>
<BR>
Probably the greatest mythology surrounds the South Western Township (Soweto)
near Johannesburg. Soweto is in fact a town in his own right, and probably
&shyp; no reliable population census was ever taken &shyp; the biggest in
Gauteng. Created during the apartheid era as a tool of white supremacy,
this gigantic shantytown became one of the centres of black resistance.
Unlit and unpaved streets of Soweto scare most whites away. Yet as any visitor
can experience at first hand, local people are perfectly friendly. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Soweto's black music labels <BR>
<BR>
</B>Soweto is also home to some fine clubs and musicians. Some of them are
truly original, as those who heard the Soweto String Quartet during the
1995 World Economic Forum meeting in Davos can attest. Unfortunately the
authorities do not understand the need to promote local artists, according
to label manager Lance McCormack from the South African subsidiary of BMG
Records. <BR>
<BR>
On the other hand there has been a considerable official effort put into
plans to aid the black population as a whole, who often suffer most from
change. &quot;The process of restructuring is going to result in further
job losses,&quot; Feinstein says. &quot;We have seen it already. The textile
sector is one example; 17,000 jobs have been lost in the past two and a
half or three years. We have got to be conscious, given our recent political
history, of the need to maintain social stability.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
While economic restructuring is the government's medium-term objective,
it tries to alleviate the consequences. The majority of the black population
between 17 and 27 have never had a job. &quot;We are not going to eliminate
unemployment but we have at least to halve the present levels in a short
to medium term,&quot; Feinstein says. <BR>
<BR>
The chosen mechanism is the grandly named Reconstruction and Development
Programme, RDP. Despite being given significant resources and even a separate
ministry to implement it, RDP has been a great disappointment so far and
has fallen well short of its stated goals. A recent reorganisation may improve
matters. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The whole country is running around the RDP,&quot; says Joan Joffe,
group executive of the country's largest cellular network provider Vodacom.
&quot;Everybody is aware that as the result of apartheid there are disadvantaged
communities and areas: we know we have to make amends.&quot; As a result,
the company says, it will install 22,000 phones in such areas over a five-year
period. <BR>
<BR>
Even literacy, an obvious tool for social advancement, may not provide the
expected results, believes Philip Clayton. &quot;Education was used as a
political football, initially by the whites, to keep blacks uneducated.
By the time the white government realised that it needed to upgrade black
skills because there were simply not enough whites to fill the jobs available
in the economy, there was a cry of 'liberation now, education later' that
led to a whole lost generation. The process of upgrading black skills here
will take a little while, given the heritage of apartheid,&quot; he says.
<BR>
<BR>
Pressure from the growing migrant population may soon stretch Gauteng's
infrastructure to breaking point. In the white suburbs electricity supply,
water, sewage and other services may still be compared to European rather
than African standards. But the cost of extending them to townships and
squatter camps fazes many businessmen. There is a clear danger of a New
York-type financial trap whereby the high taxes required to maintain a crumbling
infrastructure have the effect of scaring away lucrative corporate tenants.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Living with the siege mentality <BR>
<BR>
</B>Regula Niehus, the regional communications manager, points out to a
different obstacle. &quot;What I realised here in South Africa is that most
of the people still live with the siege mentality. They have not yet understood
that the competition is coming in and if they want to survive they must
leave their closed environment and start exporting. To get companies to
be export-orientated is really an extremely difficult task,&quot; she believes.
Yet even she is optimistic about the country's economic future. <BR>
<BR>
Joan Joffe agrees. &quot;The potential is here, we have got the knowledge,
things work here. The transition has been a miracle, people are getting
on with one another, socialising, working together. There is a good spirit
in the country.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The busy entrepreneurial spirit of the new South Africa finds its earthly
form in Sandy Lowitt, the youthful director of economic policy, trade and
investment promotion of the Gauteng Provincial Government. <BR>
<BR>
Despite the chaos of the new office, Lowitt cheerfully greeted one vistor
with documents full of facts and figures as well as spades of positive attitude.
The office is home to the Gauteng Economic Development Agency, a one-stop
shop for foreign investors. The air of excitement is palpable.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="jacaranda"></A>STREETS OF JACARANDA</H3>
<H4>Pretoria's streets house the usual attractions as well as a diamond
mine and African art galleries </H4>
<H1></H1>
&quot;It is safe, it is clean!&quot; exclaims Peet du Preez, when asked
about the main attractions of the South African capital. As the marketing
and communications director for Pretoria City Council, he predictably parades
all the benefits that the city has to offer a potential investor, trader
or tourist. Yet the businesslike efficiency of his presentation barely hides
an almost indecent enthusiasm for his subject. <BR>
<BR>
Much the same can be said for tourism officer Veronica Shrives. Facts, place
names and figures roll quickly from her tongue. Pretoria has 35 museums,
old buildings, a diamond mine, many art galleries and some of the world's
finest collections of African and ethnic art. There are also 50 restaurants
and wine bars located along its orderly, jacaranda-lined streets. And Pretoria
is strategically located in terms of nearby attractions like the Eastern
Transvaal, Northern Transvaal, Kruger Park and Sun City. Many nature reserves
are only an hour's drive away and operators can provide custom-made tours.
<BR>
<BR>
While admitting that industrial Johannesburg is hardly a holiday attraction,
parliamentarian Andrew Feinstein points to the benefits gained from the
impressive 15% annual growth in regional tourism. &quot;For every 30 foreign
tourists that come to this country we create one direct or two indirect
jobs,&quot; he says. &quot;We have to find more of those sectors that will
provide employment, particularly to those economically marginalised, like
the young.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
As everywhere in South Africa, job creation is a priority. &quot;We have
semi-skilled, semi-literate people and we have to help them make a living,&quot;
stresses Victor Mathale, the small business manager of Pretoria City Council.
&quot;At the same time we need high-tech, highly skilled investment. As
the level of literacy increases people can progress to high-tech jobs.&quot;
&quot;We manufacture more than 45% of South African motor vehicles,&quot;
says Du Preez. While this may not amount to a serious challenge to Detroit,
the expected economic revival of Southern Africa should help it to become
at least a regional automotive centre. As Du Preez points out, local authorities
do not want to attract investors at any price. Only those providing the
best fit for the region have any prospect of help. <BR>
<BR>
High on the list is brainpower. Pretoria is the country's educational system
with its three universities, plus the world's largest distant-learning institution,
UNISA and more than 35 research institutes. <BR>
<BR>
Yet there is general agreement that tourism is one of the top two growth
areas. The dramatic increase in the number of international visitors during
the past few years has exposed all the deficiencies of the country's infrastructure.
<BR>
<BR>
This situation will be partially addressed by two five-star hotels being
built now. One is probably the biggest single foreign investment project
in South Africa. But the need for more beds in the &quot;Jacaranda City&quot;,
admits, has yet to be rectified.<BR><BR>

<H4><BR>
The steel company Iscor used foreign sanctions to carve out new markets
in east Asia and is now ready to expand </H4>
<H3></H3>
<I>By Marek Garztecki <BR>
<BR>
</I>With manufacturing making up almost a third of GDP and mining accounting
for 5.5%, Gauteng is not only an industrial powerhouse for the country but
also an economic giant on a continental scale. Metaphorically speaking,
Gauteng's industrial heart is made of gold and its muscles of steel. <BR>
<BR>
Gold mining accounts for almost 10% of the region's gross geographical product,
a local measure of GDP. In 1992 Gauteng mines accounted for 39% of the gold
ore milled in South Africa and the metal is by far the country's most valuable
export. <BR>
<BR>
There is also a large iron and steel industry. &quot;As a company and private
organisation, to survive we have to be profitable,&quot; says Ernest Webb-Stock,
the divisional manager of Iscor, the country's largest steel producer. This
would be a rather ordinary statement if it were not for the fact that until
1989 Iscor was an almost monopolistic state-owned firm more reminiscent
of the Soviet Union than a free market. <BR>
<BR>
Even so, South Africa aggressively developed new markets in Asia and the
Pacific Rim and kept pace with technological change. &quot;This happened
in the sanctions era, when Europe and America were closed to our steel,&quot;
says Webb-Stock. &quot;We had to develop the Far Eastern markets and they
still remain our biggest clients.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Having been forced to enter one of the world's toughest markets, the South
African steel industry can boast today of its ability to compete with the
Koreans, unlike European rivals. Iscor is now opening a new 600-job Saldanha
plant in the Western Cape. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Attacking neighbouring markets <BR>
<BR>
</B>The company can also afford to be choosy. &quot;We will maintain a presence
on the markets where we get the best prices,&quot; Webb-Stock maintains.
With the steel cycle on the way down, Iscor looks at Africa as the market
of the future. &quot;We are already exporting to neighbouring countries
like Zimbabwe, Botswana and Malawi but it is done on a commercial basis,
even if we see it as a moral obligation to help with the development of
Africa,&quot; he insists. <BR>
<BR>
Modernisation, job creation and northward expansion into Africa are the
three main themes dominating conversation with almost any South African
industrialist. For politicians, fighting unemployment comes as a priority,
especially as international competition forces local firms into further
rationalisation and shedding of labour. While in the short term these two
trends seem mutually exclusive, in the long run they can complement each
other, believes provincial legislature economic affairs committee chairman
Andrew Feinstein. That is why the legislature has commissioned studies to
identify the most promising growth areas. <BR>
<BR>
Although the official results of the studies are not yet published Feinstein
envisages that they will single out &quot;the production of motor vehicles,
including component parts, fabricated metals, certain types of iron and
steel, construction and infrastructure generally, food processing and certain
downstream chemical products,&quot; he says. &quot;South Africa has a potential
that it has never attained for obvious political reasons,&quot; adds Feinstein.
&quot;In the medium term we would like to see some niche sectors, industrial
manufacturing sectors that we believe can be competitive either in the global
sense, or in certain specific markets where it makes more sense to service
them from South Africa than other destinations. I do not think it is realistic
to expect us to compete with the Germanys and the Japans,&quot; he says.
<BR>
<BR>
The changes have enticed back a number of international industrial giants,
like the Zurich-based conglomerate ABB which has chosen Gauteng as the site
of its sub-Saharan Africa headquarters. &quot;We have definitive plans for
the development of manufacturing capacity in South Africa,&quot; declares
ABB regional communications manager Regula Niehus. <BR>
<BR>
While old and new industries are not generally seen as compatible, in Gauteng
they are able to feed one another, with the modernisation of the steel and
manufacturing industry vastly expanding the market for information technology
and telecommunications. The impressive growth of the Vodacom cellular network
is the most obvious case. <BR>
<BR>
Established firms like Iscor are also seeking to expand. Not content with
an almost 75% share of the local market it is now seeking to expand abroad
according to Webb-Stock.

<B>The changes have ushered in reforms for the Jo'burg stock exchange and
mergers for the country's banks <BR>
<BR>
</B><I>By Marek Garztecki <BR>
<BR>
</I>Johannesburg does for Africa what New York does for the world: it is
the continental centre for commerce and finance. With a stock exchange that
is by far the largest in Africa, a comprehensive, modern banking network
and a host of well developed financial services, the city is one of the
southern hemisphere's biggest money-boxes. The political and economic changes
of the last few years have further strengthened its dominant position. <BR>
<BR>
Paul G Bigler II, the vice president of Citibank in South Africa, says that
the most dramatic change, has been the growing internationalisation and
openness of the local financial markets. He also singles out the abolition
of a dual currency system last year as another crucial change. <BR>
<BR>
Ray C Andersen, the executive president of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange
(JSE), concurs: &quot;The changes have been absolutely fundamental. The
abolition of sanctions and the ending of the apartheid era has opened world
markets to South Africa and it has also opened Africa to South Africa.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
In practical terms, this has meant a substantial inflow of foreign capital
into South African securities. In 1994 net foreign indirect investment amounted
to just R200 million ($45 million), a year later it jumped to more than
22-fold to R4.5 billion. In the first three months of this year alone, it
has reached R2.5 billion. <BR>
<BR>
According to Andersen, foreign investment now accounts for over half the
trading on the JSE. At the same time, it has been restructured. &quot;We
have opened the membership worldwide,&quot; he points out, &quot;where previously
it was restricted to South African citizens. Of our 47 broking firms, nine
are now owned by foreign banks. &quot; <BR>
<BR>
The JSE listings requirements are now based on those used by the London
Stock Exchange. The capital adequacy regime for brokers is now based on
a European Union directive. An automated trading system is being installed.
&quot;We are one industry that is adapting to South Africa's opening to
the world,&quot; says Andersen. <BR>
<BR>
A similar process is taking place in the banking world. &quot;Opening the
economy also means the opening of many foreign banks,&quot; says Philip
Clayton, senior economist at the Standard Bank of South Africa. &quot;We
have seen that challenge, we noticed the massive down-scaling of jobs in
the British banking sector, we have seen that they are bringing down the
cost-revenue ratios. We know what the benchmarks are, we are aiming for
it,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The consultants cometh <BR>
<BR>
</B>In the case of Standard, the second-biggest local bank, this meant a
re-structuring which involved merging its merchant house and the corporate
market division to create Standard Corporate &amp; Merchant Bank. Management
consultants McKinsey were brought in and 700 redundancies in the head office
are to follow. <BR>
<BR>
Other local banks are consolidating. Four of them &shyp; Allied, TrustBank,
United and Volkskas &shyp; have merged to form ABSA Bank, the country's
largest home-grown operation. The history of Standard Bank, created as a
result of the divestment of the Standard Chartered Bank during the period
of sanctions, is more typical. Similarly, the First National Bank of Southern
Africa is a result of a divestment by Barclays. This has strengthened the
local banking sector against foreign competition. <BR>
<BR>
According to Clayton, the top four South African banks rank in the top 20
in the world by asset base, close to those of Poland and Russia. <BR>
<BR>
Huge industrial conglomerates, another legacy of the past, are also facing
restructuring. Andersen says: &quot;During the sanctions period, when foreign
companies disinvested, it tended to be the local conglomerates who bought
the companies that were shed. What we are finding now is a natural tendency
towards unbundling.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Andersen believes that as institutions begin to invest offshore, they will
focus on a more limited number of core businesses. Their present shape,
spanning a wide range of industries, partly reflects the lack of investment
opportunities abroad. Already two local giants, Gencor and the Johannesburg
Consolidated Investments Group are in the process of unbundling. <BR>
<BR>
Another familiar feature of a country with an newly opened economy is a
privatisation programme, although ANC politicians insist on calling it a
restructuring. The executive president of the JSE can afford to be a bit
more blunt. He believes that the government is finalising its privatisation
strategy, quietly negotiating with the trade unions to smooth the process.
In the meantime, the parastatals are converting from government-controlled
to limited liability companies. &quot;The issue of nationalisation was taken
off the agenda long before the elections,&quot; Andersen says for those
who remember past ANC slogans. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is really an old perception. All utterances by the government
of national unity are about free markets, good fiscal and monetary discipline.
Privatisation is definitely on the agenda: the only thing that is being
debated is how and when, not if.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>A special programme for the poor <BR>
<BR>
</B>Andrew Feinstein, ANC member and a leading parliamentarian in the Provincial
Legislature readily agrees along with other politicians and many (still
mainly white) business people, who would also like to see privatisation
used to aid the black empowerment programme and offer shares at a discount
to the less well-off. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Twelve months ago there were only three black-controlled companies
listed on the stock exchange; today there are 14, with a market capitalisation
of about R8 billion,&quot; says the JSE president. <BR>
<BR>
Wide share distribution is all the more important, he believes, as South
Africa lacks a middle class. &quot;The wealth is very much distributed to
a thin veneer at the top, often racially defined,&quot; Andersen says. The
stock exchange reacted to this need by bringing special listings requirements
to help raise capital for the Reconstruction &amp; Development Programme
(RDP), which raises funds for investment in emerging businesses. One of
the biggest South African conglomerates, Anglo-American, is already making
opportunities available for black investors. <BR>
<BR>
Some bankers and business people privately admit that there is also pressure
to bring about a speedier change in the racial balance among South African
managers. According to Pieter van Huyssteen, chief executive of PW Corporate
Finance: &quot;We have a huge shortage of skills and professional and managerial
manpower. This has created a tremendous pressure. One professional can provide
jobs for a number of unskilled people, limiting the number of people that
can be employed. This is a typical South African problem.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Another obstacle in the way of a truly free financial sector is the continued
imposition of exchange controls. Although most expect them to be lifted
within the next 12 months, they are not only an irritant but also a serious
impediment to the growth of the local financial sector. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;For our subsidiary bank to finance a trade deal between Tanzania and
Zimbabwe from South Africa is virtually impossible,&quot; Clayton complains.
Neither is his bank able to finance a privatisation abroad, except in some
limited circumstances, where an immediate benefit to South Africa can be
proved. &quot;In comparison with our competitors from the US or Great Britain,
we are working with one hand tied behind our backs,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Producing better products <BR>
<BR>
</B>This elicits an emphatic rebuke from Citibank's Bigler. A subsidiary
of a foreign bank incorporated in South Africa is subject to the same restrictions
as the native banks but has to operate with the disadvantage of a much smaller
capital base. It is the global reach of large organisations and their products
that give them the edge, he insists. <BR>
<BR>
But both the foreign and the local banker agree on the financial sector's
promising future. &quot;Will there be stability here? Yes. How long will
it take? Who knows?&quot; asks Bigler, &quot;But our return, broadly speaking,
is a vote of confidence in the opportunities we see to further our African
business.&quot; <p>

<H4>The country's new conservative president and government saw a record
drop in popularity and a series of sharp confrontations with workers in
their first year of office, after ditching over-ambitious election promises.
Now they are more at ease with themselves and are finally imposing tough
economic constraints. although state support for key sectors of the economy
remains strong <BR>

<H3><A NAME="overview"></A>THE RETURN TO ORTHODOXY </H3>
<B>After a painful year of hardship and upheaval, President Chirac's government
is beginning to find its feet <BR>
<BR>
</B><I>By Diana Geddes </I><BR>
<BR>
&quot;We will ultimately be judged on our ability to produce a deep and
lasting movement of job creation,&quot; declared Alain Jupp&eacute;, France's
newly appointed Gaullist prime minister, last June after unveiling a 50
billion franc ($9.8 billion) package to create 700,000 jobs by the end of
this year. <BR>
<BR>
It always seemed an ambitious goal: now it looks plain crazy. Whereas 115,000
jobs were created in the first half of last year, <I>before</I> the present
government came to power, a mere 25,000 were created in the second half.
The official forecast for the first six months of this year is for zero
job creation at best and there is the strong possibility of an actual decline.
Unemployment, having fallen steadily from a peak of 12.5% in March 1994
to 11.4% last August, has since been on the rise again and is expected to
top 12% by June. This will give France the highest jobless rate for any
large developed nation except Italy. <BR>
<BR>
This helps explain the catastrophic fall in popularity of President Jacques
Chirac and his prime minister. Within four months of coming to power in
May last year, their initial high poll ratings with around two-thirds of
the population had been halved. <BR>
<BR>
Not since the beginning of the Fifth Republic in 1958 had a French president
lost so much popularity so fast. Since the beginning of this year, Chirac's
approval ratings have begun to rise (to around 40-46% in April), but those
of Jupp&eacute; have remained at around 30-33%. <BR>
<BR>
During his presidential campaign, Chirac had led the French to believe that
he could do what everyone else maintained was impossible: cut unemployment,
raise wages, lower taxes, increase welfare spending and slash the near-record
public deficit, all at the same time. But within five months of his arrival
at the Elys&eacute;e, he admitted there was &quot;no magic wand&quot;. Expectations
were sky-high: the ensuing disappointment was correspondingly deep. <BR>
<BR>
No one, of course, believed that he could really do all that he set out
to do. But few had expected him to do the exact opposite of what he had
promised. Taxes, instead of going down, have risen sharply by some FFr100
billion a year to a record 45.7% of GDP, one of the highest rates in the
western world. <BR>
<BR>
The promised war on unemployment, once billed as the government's &quot;priority
of priorities&quot;, was replaced by the battle to reduce the public deficit
in line with the Maastricht criteria for membership of economic and monetary
union (EMU). Wages have been frozen for public sector workers, despite Chirac's
conviction that this leads to more unemployment. <BR>
<BR>
But it was last November's plans for an overhaul of the extravagant and
inefficient social welfare system which proved the last straw for many.
Not only were they to be subjected to hefty new welfare charges and sharp
cuts in health spending, but public sector workers were also asked to work
longer in order to qualify for a full state pension. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Change or decline </B><BR>
<BR>
Some days after the government's announcement the railway workers, who were
also facing a painful restructuring of the debt-ridden state railways, and
public transport workers went on strike, sparking off the worst bout of
industrial unrest France had seen since <I>les &eacute;v&eacute;nements</I>
of May 1968. In the midst of the strike, which soon spread to the whole
public sector and brought much of the country's economic life to a standstill,
Jupp&eacute; went on television. &quot;France is at a crossroads&quot;,
he declared: &quot;Its only choice is between change or decline... Reform
is needed now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The trouble was that the government had already erred when it failed to
make the most of the honeymoon period between a newly elected president
and the electorate to push through much-needed but unpopular reforms. Rarely
could there have been a more propitious moment to act. In addition to the
presidency, the right was now in control of over 80% of the seats in the
National Assembly, two-thirds of the Senate, 20 of the 22 regional councils,
four-fifths of the departmental councils and about half the big towns. Never
before had there been such a concentration of power under the Fifth Republic.
Yet the government dithered. <BR>
<BR>
A few days after his brave words about the need for change, Jupp&eacute;
was forced to climb down. The reform of public sector pensions was shelved,
the particularly generous pension schemes for rail and public transport
workers left untouched and the controversial railways restructuring plan
&quot;frozen&quot;. Action on the separate but equally explosive issue of
reforming a complex and outmoded fiscal system was postponed. <BR>
<BR>
But the public health reforms, constituting the heart of the government's
welfare reform package, remained intact as did the deeply unpopular welfare
charges. These are now gradually being introduced with surprisingly little
fuss and should be fully in place by June. Union threats of a new &quot;social
explosion&quot; have so far failed to materialise. <BR>
<BR>
For the moment, the government is anxious to avoid introducing further controversial
reforms. But it remains adamant about the need to reduce its massive public
deficit, heading for a near-record 5.7% of GDP when the administration came
to power, to 3% by the end of next year to meet the Maastricht convergence
criteria. <BR>
<BR>
With the government's new promise of no further tax hikes, coupled with
a dramatic slow-down in the economy (growth forecasts have halved to just
1.3% this year), this will prove extremely difficult, or impossible. But
there is no longer any doubt about the government's or Chirac's determination.
<BR>
<BR>
It was not always so. In 1978 Chirac made his &quot;appel de Cochin&quot;
from a bed in the Cochin hospital after a car accident, castigating the
then-president Val&eacute;ry Giscard d'Estaing's supporters as the &quot;foreigners'
party&quot; because of their pro-European views. Ever since then, Chirac
has appeared a waverer on Europe, alternately blowing lukewarm and cold.
But the construction of Europe and, with it, the realisation of a single
currency is now emerging as one of the great causes of his presidency. <BR>
<BR>
Chirac has turned from a hesitant European into a convinced European. <I>Le
Monde</I>, the left-wing newspaper not usually known for its support of
the president, has suggested that he could become the new &quot;prophet
of Europe&quot;. Even Jacques Delors, the former socialist president of
the European Commission and leading French Europhile, recently felt moved
to pay tribute to Chirac's &quot;evolution&quot;. Chirac remains a pragmatist
but like his predecessors he has come to believe that the only viable future
for France is in a strong and more closely integrated Europe. <BR>
<BR>
The collapse of the Soviet empire and the reunification of Germany affected
France more than most western countries. It suddenly found itself deprived
both of its self-assigned role as a neutral balancing force between the
two superpowers and of its supremacy in Europe. For a long time it floundered,
uncertain of how to preserve its self-claimed role as a leading actor on
the world scene. <BR>
<BR>
Ironically, it is the Gaullist Chirac who has become the first to accept
that France no longer has the financial means, political weight or military
force to continue with its traditional, Gaullist &quot;go-it-alone&quot;
approach to foreign policy. Bosnia has brought that home with force. He
appears increasingly convinced that it is only by giving some of France's
jealously guarded independence and by working more in cooperation with others
that France, a medium-sized industrial power, can hope to maintain its place
at the top table of nations. That means closer cooperation with Nato and
Europe. <BR>
<BR>
France's decision last December to resume its seat on Nato's military committee
and allow its defence minister to take part regularly in Nato meetings,
thereby ending a 30-year Gaullist boycott, is of great significance in this
respect. So, too, is its agreement to discuss the formerly taboo subject
of nuclear deterrence within Nato. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The march back to Nato </B><BR>
<BR>
The move is seen as a logical follow-up to France's offer last autumn to
extend the French nuclear umbrella to the whole of Europe. In return for
its closer cooperation with Nato, France is hoping to win American acceptance
for a distinct &quot;European defence pillar&quot; within the Alliance which
would be able to act on its own &shyp; with American logistic back-up &shyp;
when the US did not wish to become directly involved. <BR>
<BR>
The proposed shake-up of France's defence system is intended to aid these
developments. Under bold plans announced by Chirac in February, conscription
is to be phased out, the armed forces cut by a third and France's fragmented
and inefficient arms industry totally restructured. <BR>
<BR>
After a year in office, the Chirac administration is beginning to find its
feet. The president himself seems less unpredictable and clearer about where
he is going, both on the economic and foreign policy fronts. Since his television
statement last October, spelling out for the first time his unambiguous
commitment to a policy of economic rigour, a strong franc and EMU, there
has been no more talk of slashing interest rates and allowing the franc
to float, thereby effectively abandoning hope of EMU membership. <BR>
<BR>
As for his ratings in the opinion polls, Chirac remains stoical. Had he
not confounded the pollsters before? After all, six months before the presidential
election his ratings were so low that many thought he would be forced to
bow out of the race altogether. <BR>
<BR>
Jupp&eacute;, once described by Chirac as &quot;the best amongst us&quot;,
is a different matter. But, despite Jupp&eacute;'s continuing deep unpopularity,
Chirac will be reluctant to get rid of so trusted and able a colleague.
None of the suggested alternatives looks any better or even as good. <BR>
<BR>
So for the moment, Jupp&eacute; stays. But the way ahead does not look easy.
More sacrifices may be required of the French public if the government is
to reduce its deficits in time to qualify for the single currency. The continuing
upward trend in unemployment remains a particular worry. If things have
not improved by early next year, Chirac may well decide to bring in someone
new to head his government and lead the right into the next legislative
elections, due in the spring of 1998.<BR><BR> <HR WIDTH=60%>

<BR>
&quot;For a year, France dreamed,&quot; says Daniel Bouton, managing director
of the bank Societe Generale, &quot;and the account books stayed closed.
Now we are looking at them.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Many observers say that France is enduring a kind of post-electoral depression
that frustrates business. The year-long presidential elections of 1995 allowed
politicians to create a feeling of reverie, giving the French a sense that
unemployment would be overcome and growth would follow. <BR>
<BR>
Reality was just around the corner. The government increased taxes and threatened
massive spending cuts. Then the absence of growth and worsening unemployment
frightened consumers and businessmen, according to Julian Jessop, an economist
specialising in France with the HSBC Midland investment bank in London.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are clearly entering a period of prudent, cautious behaviour,&quot;
says Alexander Lagayette, president of the government public debt agency,
the Caisse des Depots et Consignations. <BR>
<BR>
Despite these difficult conditions, private companies are enjoying a slow
return to profit. Many of the country's largest firms, from industrial giants
like Saint-Gobain to insurance companies like the Union des Assurances de
Paris, have enjoyed good results in the past year. A few like Michelin have
even performed exceptionally. Large French industry is successfully down-sizing,
adding value and becoming ever-more competitive on foreign markets. But
job-creation will remain virtually stagnant throughout this year which means
domestic demand will remain slack. <BR>
<BR>
Not everyone believes the upturn will last. &quot;The largest French companies
are following a conservative strategy that may not apply well to a troubled
economy,&quot; says Jacques Loussert, chief French equities analyst at the
Kleinwort Benson investment bank in Paris. <BR>
<BR>
Investment abroad has helped some large French companies, but a number have
invested heavily in Europe, often in Germany and central Europe, missing
higher growth in Asia and the US. <BR>
<BR>
As a result, the fraught question of European Monetary Union is now crucial
to their survival. Some observers, like Bouton at Societe Generale, insist
that the target date of 1999 will not be missed. But the question remains
a source of anxiety. <BR>
<BR>
French companies may be extremely competitive abroad, as last year's balance-of-payments
surplus shows. But growth is flat and unemployment is high at almost 13%.
Nor are prospects good. &quot;France can look forward to a marked rise in
GNP growth in the second half of 1996 for technical reasons,&quot; says
Francoise Milewski, assistant director of the economic statistics department
at the Observatoire Francais des Conjonctures Economiques (OFCE, the French
Economic Observatory). But he says 1996 growth will probably amount to 1%
or less. <BR>
<BR>
Milewski says the government faces some acute problems. &quot;There is little
chance that the Maastricht goals [for European Monetary Union] can be obtained
if the government does not find another way to raise revenue. &quot;Yet
if more taxes are in store, economic growth will be smothered,&quot; he
says. <BR>
<BR>
While inflation is low, close to 1% according to the OFCE, interest rates
remain relatively high. Because of the close link between the deutschmark
and franc the Banque de France cannot lower interest rates to stimulate
the economy unless Germany does. So bank loans are expensive and companies
loathe to invest. But unless enterprise invests and creates jobs, household
spending will remain depressed and growth will stay sluggish. <BR>
<BR>
There are other problems. Financing for start-ups has declined drastically
over the past four years, according to Christian Baillet, director of the
venture capital fund QUILMES in Paris. &quot;In the late '80s there was
a boom of venture capital finance, imitating that of the US. Unfortunately,
a large majority of these businesses failed. Now we financiers have become
extremely cautious,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
Most entrepreneurs also suffer a lack of business training. &quot;The highly
trained <I>cadres</I> who graduate from France's best schools want corporate
jobs; they think that starting a business will get their hands dirty,&quot;
comments Alexander Lagayette of the CDC. &quot;Yet the less-educated small
business people who do take the leap don't really grasp the difficulties.&quot;
New reforms of the universities, may help close the training gap. <BR>
<BR>
Local initiatives taken by the government are beginning to bear fruit in
this critical area. &quot;Small enterprise has to be aided with a microeconomic
effort, so that the problems of different regions of the country can be
taken into account,&quot; Lagayette adds. <BR>
<BR>
Another challenge for ministers is reform of the public sector. &quot;It
is absolutely essential that the government be relieved of the burden of
the state-owned enterprises,&quot; Bouton says. The best part of French
state industry has already been privatised. But deeply troubled firms remain
like Air France and bank Credit Lyonnais. <BR>
<BR>
There are areas where government economic reform is likely to succeed. Changes
in the armed forces, launched this year, will help control spending and
the defence sector is being rationalised, through the merger of the efficient
private Dassault firm with the loss-making public giant Aerospatiale. <BR>
<BR>
Other public sector problems clamour for attention. In April, the <I>fonctionnaires</I>
or state employees who run the vast state telecommunications monopoly France
Telecom provoked a major strike &shyp; the second in six months &shyp; over
privatisation proposals. <BR>
<BR>
A growing and voluable public resentment against such actions began to make
itself heard. &quot;I have to keep my store open regardless of how difficult
they make it,&quot; comments Antoine Bordenave, a vintner in the centre
of Paris. &quot;They have nothing to worry about, because they cannot lose
their jobs. I can lose everything.&quot; A <I>fonctionnaire</I> at France
Telecom is practically exempt from the danger of being fired or laid off
and enjoys considerable perks unavailable to private sector staff. <BR>
<BR>
Bordenave's attitude indicates growing private sector anger towards the
public sector, says Patrick Rozenblatt, a sociologist and economist at the
Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (National Research Centre).But
even with falling public support, it will not be easy to reform public enterprise.
&quot;The <I>fonctionnaire</I> at France Telecom, or the Air France employee,
believes he is the victim of an injustice. He feels that he works for the
French state with its glorious principles of liberty and equality,&quot;
Rozenblatt says. &quot;He sees himself as a direct descendant from the heroes
of 1792 and believes that liberty means the right to work for the state.
What does he care about the 'globalisation' of the economy and the free-market
forces that are threatening his protected status?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
With <I>fonctionnaires</I> and the employees of state-owned companies making
up almost a quarter of the total workforce, the government is going to be
hard-pressed to push through the reforms it needs so much. This goes a long
way to explaining why the privatisation of France Telecom has been delayed
year after year. <BR>
<BR>
Will all these formidable obstacles be overcome? &quot;French industry is
increasingly competitive abroad and that is where the future lies,&quot;
according to one French government official. <BR>
<BR>
Given all the difficulties at home, it remains to be seen just how well
the country will fare. <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%><BR>
<H3><A NAME="foriegn-investment"></A>THE DOLLAR MAGNET </H3>
<B>France is now a major target for foreign funds seeking a home within
the European single market <BR>
</B><BR>
The unstable economy in France and Europe as a whole, combined with noisy
strikes in the public sector, has only slightly affected investment in France
according to the Ministry of Economy. By contrast, French investment abroad
has declined markedly but should pick up again in the coming two years.
<BR>
<BR>
France is still the third largest target for foreign direct investment,
according to the World Competitiveness Report. It comes just after the UK,
but it must be said that there is some controversy over the statistics.
&quot;Certainly the two are still close&quot;, comments Peter Hall, a director
of mergers and acquisitions at Chase Manhattan bank in London. &quot;France
may appear more attractive to companies which are seeking a &THORN;rst foothold
close to the heart of a united Europe,&quot; Hall explains. The UK's endless
debates on its future in Europe create uncertainty in the minds of investors
and make some companies steer clear. <BR>
<BR>
The high-technology sector made up most of the $150 billion France attracted
in FDI last year. &quot;Technology and the high standard of workforce education
are the keys,&quot; comments Jean-Daniel Tordjman, ambassador-at-large for
international investment at the Ministry of the Economy. The most important
projects have involved high-tech companies like IBM which invested $1 billion
at Corbeil (near Paris) in a research centre, or the American AMTEL semi-conductor
firm which put $700 million into a production plant at Marseilles. Motorola
will soon employ 500 scientists at a facility near Toulouse whose job will
be to coordinate the company's telecommunications activities in Russia and
India. <BR>
<BR>
The US is by far the leader in French FDI while Japan is still timid, concerned
about the country's structural problems. The great barrier confronting those
who would invest in France is the rigidity of the country's labour laws.
&quot;The French are doing everything right,&quot; says Christian Marriot,
an analyst of international mergers and acquisitions with the London-based
trade magazine <I>Acquisitions Monthly</I>. &quot;But there is still one
basic advantage of investing in the UK: you can sack everyone you need to.&quot;
In France, labour law makes downsizing much more difficult. <BR>
<BR>
Tordjman admits that there are still problems facing would-be investors,
but says that much red tape has been eliminated. &quot;There is no longer
any need to obtain an authorisation from the French government for any acquisition
outside the defence area. And we at the ministry are bringing foreign investors
together with local authorities to help eliminate any provincial restrictions.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Certainly, as far as Tordjman is concerned, France's image problem has been
solved. &quot;We are no longer perceived as arrogant by foreign investors.
We are, on the contrary, famous for working well with them.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
French investments abroad, often in Germany and central Europe, have been
less successful and many &THORN;rms still rue the decisions they made at
the peak of Euro-enthusiasm. <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%><BR>
<H3><A NAME="grand-alliance"></A>THE GRAND ALLIANCE </H3>
<B>Enthusiasm for all things private has made an impact in France. But state
industries will remain important <BR>
<BR>
</B><I>By Andrew Rosenbaum </I><BR>
<BR>
For two years Jean-Claude Leny fought to halt the privatisation of his company
Framatome, one of the world's largest constructors of nuclear energy plants
and the sole nuclear power station constructor for the state electricity
company El&eacute;ctricit&eacute; De France (EDF). He won late in 1994.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our company is in a specialised line of business,&quot; Leny says.
&quot;The government has realised that Framatome is special and a move into
the private sector and therefore its separation from the French nuclear
complex would amount to the beginning of its dismantling.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Leny's critics complain that there is nothing particularly out of the ordinary
about his company and argue that bringing a little competition to the sector,
as in the UK and in the US, could do no harm although even in the Anglo-Saxon
world it is far removed from the sort of competition seen in the telecommunications
market. <BR>
<BR>
But Leny had some strong cards to play. Framatome is not an uncompetitive,
overstaffed state agency. Analysts say it is lean and mean, its prices are
reasonable and it is a wolfish competitor for export business. &quot;Framatome
is a tough competitor with the highest standard of technology,&quot; comments
Dick Kovan of <I>Nuclear Engineering</I>, an industry trade magazine based
in Sutton in the UK. &quot;It is one of the market leaders for nuclear energy
in Asia.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Leny's Framatome is only one of a number of French companies, some virtual
monopolies, whose operations are profitable both inside and outside France.
It is a special French model called &quot;High-Tech Colbertism,&quot; the
title of a book by one of its principal experts Elie Cohen, director of
the state research centre, the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique.
It takes its name from Jean-Baptiste Colbert who directed the French economy
under Louis XIV. <BR>
<BR>
As Cohen, one of France's well-known management theorists, puts it: &quot;The
rhetoric for privatisation has lagged well behind economic reality in France.&quot;
His book details the considerable success this model has enjoyed, although
he is sceptical about its future. <BR>
<BR>
Apart from national monuments like the state-owned electricity monopoly
EDF and telecommunications monopoly, France Telecom, there are companies
with huge privileges granted by the state like Alcatel-Alsthom. Altogether,
according to the Paris-based research agency the Observatoire Francaise
des Conjonctures Economiques, state &THORN;rms and those with approved monopolies
account for close to 10% of French GNP. Their role in France's total exports
is also crucial. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Prime example of state model </B><BR>
<BR>
In fact, despite the wave of privatisations in France &shyp; many of them
companies that were already partially private &shyp; nothing is likely to
be done about key sectors like telecommunications and electricity production.
The argument, in the terms that the French government has adopted, is that
the state should continue to enjoy the profits these companies produce.
Framatome presents a good example of this type of company. It saw FFr20
billion ($3.9 billion) in sales and FFr1 billion ($196 million) in profits
in 1994. Success on the export markets, according to French theory and practice,
justify the state support it enjoys. <BR>
<BR>
The result, complains Ashley Finch, marketing manager for Taiwan and China
at British Nuclear Fuels in Lilyhall, Cumbria, &quot;is that Framatome has
developed a more complete offer of nuclear services than we can, not having
such state support.&quot; Finch explains that some nuclear services are
uneconomic, and most companies from other countries in the industry cannot
compete. &quot;Even giants like Siemens and Westinghouse cannot manage it,&quot;
he says. <BR>
<BR>
With only one supplier of nuclear technology, the price of electricity should
be higher in France than elsewhere. But in fact, consumers pay slightly
less. A good case for maintaining state monopolies? The answer is sometimes.
Consumers do not always enjoy advantages as the example of France Telecom
shows. Telephone rates are higher in France than elsewhere, although the
system has been much improved since the '70s.<p>

<H2>LYON </H2>
<H4>Host of the next G7 economic summit, Lyon is working hard to realise
its promise. The city is seeking to entice foreign investors with tax breaks
and practical advice, offering a strong industrial and research base and
superior style of life. At the same time, it is trying to modify its focus
on the French capital and look to the rest of Europe for a prosperous future.

<B>Lyon is challenging the capital and other French cities for the title
of ideal location for foreign investors <BR>
<BR>
</B><I>By Elisabeth Faure </I><BR>
<BR>
Lyon, like all other big cities away from the capital, feels resentful about
its provincial status but this common inferiority complex is made worse
by its particular history. Tension with Paris dates from the end of the
16th century, a time when Lyon was not only more important but also considered
the possible site of a new capital by King Francois I. As Europe continues
the onward (albeit fractious) march towards integration, there is some sense
that the city may now be ready to regain some of its old prominence. <BR>
<BR>
Its image certainly needs to change. In recent times Lyon has struggled
with a reputation as an isolated city of passage. This is acknowledged by
Andr&eacute; Soulier, deputy mayor of Lyon, who believes the <I>syndrome
des tunnels, </I>a phrase derived from the large number of road and rail
tunnels in the region, is outdated and must be changed. &quot;Lyon still
relies on Paris for its identity and it is time the city looked away from
the capital toward the international community,&quot; he says. &quot;The
city will become a regional capital of Europe.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
So far, however, Lyon is far from achieving this status and its charming,
relaxed pace suggests a parochial self-satisfaction. Nor is Lyon the only
city in France with ambitions to be a regional capital within the new Europe:
it is in direct competition with others including Montpellier, Toulouse
and Geneva in Switzerland. <BR>
<BR>
City and regional officials agree that attracting foreign investment is
a priority if the city is to be transformed. As a result, an organised support
network has been established for foreign firms seeking a presence. Entreprise
Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes International (ERAI), which was created two years ago
and is financed by the regional government, is the organisation in charge
of attracting foreign investors to the Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes region. It conducts
marketing studies, works out transport costs and logistics and serves as
agent, introducing potential investors to possible partners. &quot;A large
foreign presence will cause a snowball effect, attracting more foreign investors,&quot;
says managing director Thierry Bernard. <BR>
<BR>
The current emphasis is on attracting medium-sized foreign companies to
the region since they are &quot;a stabilising force in the economy and easier
to control&quot;, says Bernard. He points out that with larger companies
like Hewlett-Packard, decisions about local branches are made far away.
If a decision is taken to close, &quot;no one can stop them and the damage
to the local economy would be enormous&quot;. With medium-sized firms, on
the other hand, if problems arise &quot;it may be easier to negotiate solutions
to encourage them to stay&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
<B>A base for foreign companies </B><BR>
<BR>
Over the past two years, ERAI has attracted firms in this category such
as Casals, Galletas and Cuetara from Spain, winning against Parisian complacency
&quot;because of ERAI's tailor-made approach to business&quot;. When the
Casals hardware<B> </B>company first established itself in Lyon, for example,
it was given space in ERAI'S building for the first months of business until
it could find offices. &quot;If there had not been room at ERAI to house
the company, I would have taken them into my own home,&quot; insists Bernard.
<BR>
<BR>
The Association pour le D&eacute;veloppement Economique de la R&eacute;gion
Lyonnaise (ADERLY) also seeks to support foreign investors. ADERLY has attracted
116 foreign firms over the past 10 years making investments worth FFr310
million ($61 million). Some 79 of these companies arrived over the past
five years, including the multilingual European television channel Euronews.
<BR>
<BR>
The agency also serves as something akin to an expatriate counselling service,
helping employees to find accommodation and suitable childcare or assisting
with the French bureaucracy. <BR>
<BR>
Robert Maury, director of ADERLY, is proud of the Euronews catch, secured
by offering tax advantages in the face of &quot;intense competition from
a dozen other cities including Munich, Valencia, Brussels and Berlin&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
Investors have also been offered the enticement of infrastructure development
projects. Lyon has its own airport and there is a motorway network linking
it directly to Paris, Marseille, Toulon, Barcelona, Turin and Milan. In
addition, the Rh&ocirc;ne has been opened to navigation by large vessels
from Lyon to Marseilles in one direction and to the Seine and the Moselle
in the other. <BR>
<BR>
Feasibility studies are being carried out on the <I>Liaison Transalpine</I>,
a project linking Paris via Lyon to Italy's Piedmont region via a new, high-speed
rail network which would halve the rail travel time between Paris and Turin
to just over three hours. If the estimated FFr250 billion ($49 billion)
can be found, it could become the EU's single largest rail infrastructure
project. In another bid to attract foreign investment, the vast modern business
quarter known as Eurocity was completed last year, near Satolas airport.
<BR>
<BR>
Other efforts include the construction of an international <I>lyc&eacute;e</I>
or secondary school. In addition the &Eacute;cole Superieure de Commerce,
a well-regarded higher education establishment, organises exchange programmes
with universities abroad. &quot;The graduates are highly competent: I recruit
a large proportion of my staff from the university,&quot; says Phillipe
Bailly, director at Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Lyon. <BR>
<BR>
Lyon also has natural qualities which appeal to business. The city has a
strong industrial base, leading France in textiles, metallurgy, machine
tools, mining equipment and plastics processing. Some large groups in the
region such as the pharmaceutical firm Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc, the M&eacute;rieux
medical institute, small electrical goods manufacturer Seb and producer
of industrial glass BSN have achieved international status. They have not
only helped the city's output reach around 10% of French GDP but also give
it a resilience which provides some shelter from any economic storms buffeting
the rest of France. <BR>
<BR>
Location is a further attraction for those foreign companies wishing to
gain access to southern Europe. Andr&eacute; Soulier describes Lyon as the
&quot;last capital of the north and the first capital of the south&quot;.
Daniel Jacq, director of IBM in Lyon, remarks: &quot;If a company is serious
about doing business in France it has to have operations in Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes
as well as Paris.&quot; His company's activities in Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes represent
up to 15% of all of IBM's business in France. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Companies have more negotiating power than they think,&quot; Jacq
states. &quot;Since all big cities in France are competing for foreign contracts,
firms can play one city off against another to lower their costs, particularly
with regard to taxation. Any firm wishing to settle in the region must take
its time choosing a location and negotiate as much as possible.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A number of potential barriers remain to the city's development, however.
Satolas airport, for example, does not run enough international charter
flights according to Christoph Radke, a partner at Lamy Veron Ribeyre, the
biggest law firm in Lyon. &quot;In this respect, Satolas is not even as
international as Manchester. It would have been better to expand Satolas
rather than build a third international airport in Paris,&quot; he comments.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>What Lyon still needs </B><BR>
<BR>
There is also a risk that the Lyon region will become saturated with traffic
unless further investment is made. The surrounding roads cannot take more
than 13,000 lorries a day and there are already up to 9,000 circulating
daily. In addition, there are only four foreign exchange offices in the
city and there is no luxury prestigious hotels which might attract conferences
and tourists. <BR>
<BR>
The city's two-hour link to Paris via France's high speed TGV train makes
it quicker for decisions made in Paris to be executed in Lyon, but some
consider it an obstacle to Lyon's progress. &quot;The TGV has a centralising
effect, making it easier for people to escape to Paris,&quot; complains
Christian Boussuges, director at the Banque de France and lecturer at the
&Eacute;cole Superieure de Commerce. &quot;A TGV linking Lyon to Turin and
Strasbourg would be much more beneficial.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Thierry Bernard feels that there is also a problem of rhetoric. For the
past few years local officials have been increasingly referring to 'Lyon
International'. &quot;This will not in itself change anything and is more
likely to draw attention to the fact that Lyon is not yet international,&quot;
he says. &quot;One does not need to refer to 'Barcelona international' or
'Frankfurt international', for example.&quot; The solution is to host a
big project or event, bigger than the G7 summit due in July: &quot;If asked,
most people would not be able to remember where the last G7 took place,&quot;
he observes. &quot;An event such as the Olympics would be more beneficial
for Lyon in the long run.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Jacq of IBM points out that the lack of official unity in the Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes
region is potentially damaging, caused by reported tension between the different
authorities. For example the two development agencies ADERLY and ERAI frequently
conflict about where foreign firms should establish themselves: while ADERLY
pushes for firms to settle in Lyon, ERAI is more concerned with promoting
the region as a whole. <BR>
<BR>
<B>A suspicion of change </B><BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, some complain that the mentality of people in Lyon is too insular
and conservative, particularly within the well established medical industry
although Alain M&eacute;rieux, director of the M&eacute;rieux Institute,
says this is changing. Things are comfortable for established families and
change would disturb all that. &quot;I would prefer to see Lyon develop
steadily and consistently rather than dramatically,&quot; observes Olivier
Gachon, director of ORI, a large land agency. &quot;By becoming a cosmopolitan
city, Lyon may lose its quality of life.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Besides problems particular to Lyon, there are other barriers to development
which are generally French in nature such as the chronic rivalry between
Paris and the regions. The British government was responsible for putting
Lyon forward as a candidate to house the Central European Bank, for example:
not the French. According to Jacq, for example, &quot;the lack of local
decision-making in the city tends to slow things down as many firms in Lyon,
particularly those in the more traditional sectors such as Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc,
have headquarters in Paris. If one wants to progress in a career it is not
possible to stay in Lyon. Many managers commute from Lyon to Paris, leaving
their families here to benefit from a better quality of life and lower cost
of living.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Most officials would like the city to develop a more decentralised, German-style
relationship with the capital but the postwar autonomy of Germany's <I>l&auml;nde</I>
is unique in Europe and as long as France's centralist tradition persists,
such a relationship is unlikely. Robert Maury says he is convinced that
France's high degree of centralisation &quot;paralyses Paris as well as
the regions: Paris has too much fat&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Another generally French problem for foreign companies, particularly the
smaller ones, is the high cost of telecommunications in France &shyp; about
three to four times higher than in the UK. Gillette opened offices in Annecy
recently but had to move to London shortly afterwards because such costs
were unmanageable. <BR>
<BR>
Despite these problems, however, foreign direct investment (FDI) in the
region has increased. According to the regional branch of the statistical
office Ins&eacute;e, FDI in the Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes region rose from FFr1.9
billion in 1986 to FFr3.9 billion in 1990, before falling back to FFr3.6
billion in 1992, the most recent estimate. The figure for France as a whole
in 1992 was FFr42.5 billion. A large proportion of Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes FDI
has been aimed at Lyon. There are a total of 189 foreign firms in the city
representing over a third of foreign companies in the entire Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes
region. <BR>
<BR>
Christian Leroi, a director at Ernst &amp; Young in Lyon, has witnessed
this increase in foreign activity: &quot;The consultancy has had to develop
a complete service for foreign firms establishing themselves in the region.
Five years ago there was no demand for expatriate services while today we
receive approximately FFr1 million in fees from these services and secure
up to 12 projects from foreign firms every year.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>An outlet for distributors </B><BR>
<BR>
Christoph Radke has also noticed an increase, particularly since the end
of 1994: &quot;Most of the new arrivals have taken the form of distribution
outlets and takeovers. Using Lyon as a base for distributing goods in southern
Europe, while keeping production in the country of origin, is usually the
first-step, low-risk option for foreign companies.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A number of Lyon observers feel that the city's current political situation
helps promote the city. Jacq at IBM considers Raymond Barre,<B> </B>former
French prime minister and now mayor of Lyon, is a positive force: &quot;He
is well known and serves as ambassador. Since his arrival last year, he
has been building links within the Rhone-Alpes region as well as with officials
in Paris and abroad.&quot; The fact that Barre is both mayor of Lyon and
president of the local government body, the Communaut&eacute; Urbaine, means
that tensions between the region and the city may be reduced. Such feelings
of optimism are fuelled as much by a dislike of his predecessor Michel Noir,
who has been barred from local politics after being charged with accepting
bribes, as they are by faith in the mayor himself. <BR>
<BR>
Officials are proud of the small but symbolic changes that have been made
recently to the city's image. Jo&euml;l Madile, head of communications at
the town hall, says: &quot;Before I took office last year, there were 48
different logos representing the city, far too many.&quot; She has chosen
one, a red lion, as Lyon's symbol. Neon displays throughout Lyon now give
residents and visitors information about the pollution level, traffic congestion
and the time, and a free monthly magazine was launched in October. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The G7 circus comes to town </B><BR>
<BR>
More substantially, perhaps, Lyon is hoping the G7 summit will boost tourism.
More than 5,000 people will be attending the summit, 2,000 of them journalists.
Amaury de Varax, director of tourism, wants to capitalise on the event and
plans to build a G7 museum. They would do well to remember the potential
pitfalls to this kind of promotional campaign: when the world's journalists
descended on Lyons in 1987 for the trial of Nazi Klaus Barbie for crimes
against humanity, Lyons gave them lavish material on the city's culinary
reputation. For their efforts, they were lambasted in the international
media for being in bad taste. <BR>
<BR>
The tourism budget has increased from FFr6 million to FFr19 million over
the past 15 years. Although there has been an increase in tourism of 25%
during the same period, Lyon is still far from being a well-known tourist
spot. <BR>
<BR>
The city's beauty is unarguable, however. Two rivers meet in the centre,
each with its own character: the narrow, convivial Sa&ocirc;ne, lined with
traditional Italian renaissance buildings, and the broader Rh&ocirc;ne,
bordered with modern blue and white structures. <BR>
<BR>
This imaginative approach to architecture can best be seen in the recently
renovated opera house; its domed roof has red lights which intensify with
the musical pitch inside. The weather is good, the city clean, transport
efficient and the food famous for its excellence. If all goes well and a
&quot;Europe of the regions&quot; is created, in which nation states diminish
in importance, Lyon has a good chance of becoming a key city, complementary
to Paris rather than at odds with the capital.<BR><BR> <HR WIDTH=60%>

<H3><A NAME="film-developments"></A>DEVELOPMENT OF FILM </H3>
<B>The unstoppable inventiveness of two brothers brought fame to them and
a huge industry to Lyon <BR>
</B><BR>
The name of a street in Lyon, <I>Rue du Premier Film</I>, is a loud and
public demonstration of the city's claim to be the birthplace of the modern
film industry. Although the centennial of cinema is being widely celebrated
this year, there is a rival orthodoxy that a vital step in the development
of the cinematic process was taken in Lyon as early as 1880. <BR>
<BR>
In that year, the brothers Louis and Auguste Lumi&egrave;re succeeded in
photographing 18 images a second, a record at that time. Their undisputed
claim to fame, however, is for the first public screening of a film in cinematic
history, on December 28, 1895 in the Grand Caf&eacute;, Boulevard des Capucines
in Paris. <BR>
<BR>
The film, entitled <I>Sortie des Usines Lumi&egrave;res </I>(Leaving the
Lumi&egrave;re Factories) was made by the Lumi&egrave;re brothers in Lyon
in 1895. It was screened using their invention the hand-cranked Cinematograph,
which made it possible for the first time to project a moving image to a
roomful of people. An ornate villa in the Street of the First Film now houses
the Lumi&egrave;re Institute and the hangar which served as the set for
the film has been preserved there. <BR>
<BR>
With their father Antoine Lumi&egrave;re, the brothers ran a photographic
studio in Lyon. Louis then developed an improved photographic plate, the
instant or dry plate. The family started commercial production of the invention
under the brand name <I>Etiquette Bleue</I> on the outskirts of the city.
By 1890 the Lumi&egrave;re factories employed 300 workers; by 1894 the firm
was the most important photographic enterprise in Europe and heavily reliant
on the region's chemicals industry. <BR>
<BR>
According to Frederique Ponsart, communications director at the Lumi&egrave;re
Institute, &quot;Lyon's chemical industry was key in manufacturing the plates,
providing a solid framework for the Lumi&egrave;re factories&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Despite commercial success, &quot;the brothers continued to be passionate
about research,&quot; Ponsart says, &quot;and in 1900, invented coloured
photographs&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The institute's 19th century home was the base of the Lumi&egrave;re company
and to this day preserves the prolific output of Luis and Auguste. Under
the institute's president, French film director Bernard Tavernier, it is
energetic in promoting the work of the Lumi&egrave;re brothers and film
culture as a whole. It organises exhibitions and sceenings and houses a
documentation centre, an education service and a publishing section. <BR>
<BR>
There has been some contention as to whether the Lumi&egrave;re brothers
were indeed the inventors of cinema. Frederique Ponsart stresses that &quot;any
invention is only a step among many, a turning point within a movement.
The invention of the plate was a natural progression but revolutionary&quot;.
The centenary celebrations held last year to commemorate the first public
screening of a film in 1895 consolidated the brothers' claim to this record.
<BR>
<BR>
The night before the start of the G7 summit, journalists will be entertained
at the Lumi&egrave;re Institute, and shown the first films ever made there.
<BR>
<BR>
Even to this day, Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes is a region that attracts film-makers.
Some 40 films have been made there over the past five years and the region's
production company is second in importance within France only to that of
Paris. Philip Kaufmann's adaption <I>The Unbearable Lightness of Being </I>and
more recently Claude Lelouch's <I>Tout &Ccedil;a pour &Ccedil;a</I> were
both produced in Lyon. <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>
<H4></H4>
<H3><A NAME="research-industry"></A>THE ENGINE OF INDUSTRY </H3>
<B>An exceptionally dense group of research centres feeds an industrial
and scientific community <BR>
</B><BR>
Lyon is the birthplace of an impressive number of inventors and academics:
Alexis Carrel who won the Nobel prize for medicine in 1912, Victor Grignard,
Nobel prizewinner for chemistry in the same year and A M Amp&egrave;re,
the physicist whose name has been given to a unit of electrical current.
In 1958, Michel Jouvet was the first to prove the existence of paradoxical
sleep, the intermediate stage between being awake and asleep, a time when
most people dream. He went on to found the Lyon school of neuroscience,
one of the world's outstanding institutions in its field. <BR>
<BR>
The engine for the French high speed train or TGV was also developed in
Lyon. <BR>
<BR>
Industrial growth in the region relies heavily on research. There are 450
public and private laboratories in greater Lyon. The city has the highest
national density of public chemical research centres and private research
is expanding. Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc has seven sites with half its French potential
and the Elf Acquitaine oil giant employs 300 researchers in its regional
office. <BR>
<BR>
The region has a particular expertise in medical research. Significant medical
projects include the use of proteins to treat Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
disease and the city is an international base for cancer research. Consciousness,
gravity and magnetism are also being studied. <BR>
<BR>
Lyon is a world capital for homeopathy and has encouraged this alternative
practice since 1799.Boiron, manufacturer of homeopathic medicine with 60%
of the French market, is based in the city. The first university diploma
in homeopathy was introduced in Lyon in 1976. <BR>
<BR>
But Thierry Bernard, director of the inward investment agency ERAI, believes
that &quot;the region must focus more on developing its expertise in medical
research and not be too tempted to diversify its research activities&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
Existing research projects in Lyon cover mathematics, data processing, materials,
earth and cosmic sciences and nuclear physics. In the postwar period, the
French government located a large part of its nuclear research effort around
Grenoble nearby. The European Synchrotron radiation facility is also based
there as is the national Atomic Energy Commission, which employs 2,600 people.
<BR>
<BR>
Public research in the area has attracted private companies both French
and foreign. According to a <I>Financial Times</I> survey on Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes,
15,000 private-sector jobs have been created around the research sector
in electronics, computer software and hardware. Many of the foreign companies
in Grenoble, such as the American firms Sun Micro Systems and SCI Systems,
are electronics specialists. <BR>
<BR>
The density of research institutes is possible at least in part because
of the number of high-quality educational establishments. Lyon 1 university
has laboratories for industrial chemistry, physical organic chemistry and
process engineering. The National Applied Sciences Institute INSA has industrial
physico-chemistry and organic chemistry laboratories. <BR>
<BR>
Some schools share their expertise and equipment with industrialists. These
include ESCIL (Lyon Chemistry Engineering School), ISPC (Industrial Physics
&amp; Chemistry Institute) and ITECH (Textile &amp; Chemical Institute).
An Ecole Normale Superieure Scientifique was founded in 1987. <BR>
<BR>
Companies in the region invest about FFr9 billion a year in research and
development. Pasteur-M&eacute;rieux, for instance, devotes 16% of its annual
turnover to research, employing 800 researchers. <BR>
<BR>
Rh&ocirc;ne-M&eacute;rieux was one of the first companies to produce vaccines
through genetic engineering. Between 1986-90, 3,107 patents originated in
the region (16.4% of the national figure) and 320 European research and
development contracts for public laboratories were signed. <BR>
<BR>
Bernard of ERAI, says this commitment to research is crucial. &quot;This
is typical of the region and the scientific environment encourages industrialists
to think in this way,&quot; he says.<BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>

<H3><A NAME="raymond-barre"></A>BARRE'S BALANCING ACT </H3>
<B>The mayor is just as confident of solving social problems as he is in
the competitiveness of Lyon's industry <BR>
<BR>
</B><I>By Andrew Rosenbaum </I><BR>
<BR>
For its mayor, Raymond Barre, running a city as complex as Lyon is a kind
of juggling act. &quot;You have to be able to balance all the different
demands made on you by different groups, and give each their due,&quot;
says the former French prime minister, who has spent much of his career
in Paris as a cabinet minister and parliamentarian and who is accustomed
to moving on the world stage. <BR>
<BR>
Lyon is a prosperous but troubled city, where the economic success of industry
is offset by high unemployment, large numbers of poor immigrants and one
of the highest crime rates in the country. Demands for government investment
in social issues are great. &quot;So it's a question of setting priorities,&quot;
Barre says. &quot;We will spend money on social causes where it is most
necessary, but we will not sacrifice development of the city.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Crime is clearly a priority. &quot;There is a sense of insecurity in some
areas of the city, and we intend to change that. Ours is an adaptive city,
and we will do what is necessary to keep crime in check,&quot; he says.
The city has a new high<B> </B>court to help it cope with being the third-busiest
circuit in the country<B>.</B> &quot;It is urgent that our city have a modern
judicial facility which [is able to] perform with great efficiency,&quot;
he says. <BR>
<BR>
The mayor believes the siting<B> </B>of courts in under-privileged areas
such as the eighth arrondissement is essential. In these areas, he says,
a kind of partnership is being established between educational bodies, business
groups and the courts in order both to prevent juvenile delinquency and
to help the return to employment of ex-offenders. <BR>
<BR>
On the integration of Lyon's large North African immigrant community, he
says: &quot;I have been heartened by the increasing dialogue between our
police and the Islamic community... when police were recently accused of
mistreatment, the local mayor was able to create a dialogue between the
Muslim community and the authorities. It shows that progress is being made.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
One of the things Barre has focused on is the development of the so-called
<I>friches industrielles</I>, an area of abandoned industrial buildings
and land in areas such as the Vaise district and the eighth arrondissement.
Barre is committed to redeveloping these districts, believing that will
help create jobs and cut crime. There are also what he calls the &quot;leftovers
from the '60s&quot;, the huge housing estates built at that time in otherwise
empty areas on the city's periphery. &quot;These need to be integrated into
the life of the city,&quot; Barre insists. Lyon even boasts a thriving agricultural
area on the outskirts of the city which Barre intends to preserve and support.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Riding French economic waves </B><BR>
<BR>
France's economic crisis has not spared Lyon. &quot;It took longer to reach
us, perhaps, but it has hit the city harder than elsewhere,&quot; Barre
says. But he thinks that the skill of Lyon's exporters will be able to overcome
the problems posed by the crisis:&quot;Our business is much better at reaching
foreign markets than is the case in many other French cities.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Even the <I>franc fort</I>, the strong French franc, has not created a barrier
to Lyonnaise exports, he adds ethusiastically. <BR>
<BR>
The statistics bear him out. According to the independent Observatoire Francais
de la Conjoncture Economique, Lyonnaise industry has benefited considerably
from investment in nearby Italy and exports there with considerable success.
&quot;The productivity and research capacity of our industry more than compensates
for a difficult economy,&quot; Barre says. &quot;Hard work makes a difference.&quot;
Adaptation is the key, he believes. For example, fhe city's successful companies
run programmes to train the unemployed. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Lyon is a kind of intelligence centre,because there is so much high-tech
research going on. The highly trained unemployed have a good chance of finding
their way into another skilled job.&quot; To maintain this, education is
a top priority. &quot;We have budgeted FFr111 million for education &shyp;
it is the second largest budget area for the city,&quot; Barre explains.
Attacked because he has reduced the budget for foreign language instruction,
he points out that education as a whole is still a priority but this particular
area must await more support from central government. <BR>
<BR>
Certainly small industry is created faster and on a better footing in Lyon
than it is in many other cities. &quot;The survival rate for small business
is higher in Lyon than it is elsewhere,&quot; Barre says. &quot;This is
because our entrepreneurs are better trained: indeed they grow up in an
environment where it is prestigious to run a small business.&quot; And small
businesses do expand into larger ones in Lyon at a faster rate than in most
cities. <BR>
<BR>
Barre is trying to link Lyon's successful businesses into a network of transregional
corporations. He sees the city as a part of a great regional economic area
stretching from Barcelona to Marseille to Genoa: Europe's great south-west.
&quot;To link Lyon not just with nearby Grenoble, but with an entire group
of cities including the likes of Geneva and Turin, is one of the great goals
I have set for myself as mayor,&quot; he says.<p>

<H2>TURKEY </H2>
<H4>Turkey has produced some impressive growth over the last 20 years. Even
so, the country currently faces a raft of serious political, economic, social
and military problems. Popular anti-western feeling has grown and political
leaders are fending off calls for the country to turn away from Europe.
But Turkish business has just been given the opportunity it has long waited
for: a customs union with the EU<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH=60%>
<H3><A NAME="eu-embrace"></A>A CLOSER EMBRACE </H3>
<B>If Turkey manages to create a strong democracy, the European Union is
promising priviliged treatment </B><BR>
<BR>
In language so plain that no one in the audience could mistake the message,
EU ambassador in Ankara Michael Lake recently spelled out to Turkey's leaders
the onerous responsibilities they are taking by signing up to an enhanced
customs union. &quot;If democracy were to falter or be threatened in Turkey
the customs union, the fate of the Turkish economy, would be immediately
called into question,&quot; he said. <BR>
<BR>
The customs union, which took effect on January 1 this year, could mark
a big step forward in realising Turkey's dream of taking its place at the
heart of Europe. Ambassador Lake called it an irreversible step, although
Greece has blocked further progress because of confrontation between the
two countries over sovereignty in the Aegean. <BR>
<BR>
Lake says the consequences of a failure would be awful. There would be financial
paralysis, a collapsing currency, a regime of severe austerity and a possible
freeze on investment with an accompanying loss of jobs and trade opportunities.
Turkey would be plunged back into economic isolation and protectionism.
No doubt stung by the impressive vote for the anti-western Islamic Welfare
Party in last year's elections, the ambassador sought to chart an alternative
path. If Turkey can live up to its obligations under the treaty, he promised
that it will enjoy the most intimate relationship with the EU of any country
in the world. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Past days of growth </B><BR>
<BR>
At almost any other time in its modern history, since the founding of the
present state in 1923 by Kemal Ataturk, the customs union might well have
been greeted with equanimity. Indeed, in the period from 1970 to 1993 Turkey
enjoyed high growth rates and a highly successful world economy. <BR>
<BR>
And while many believe that Turkey's closer integration with Europe will
again help to make it one of the strongest emerging market economies, the
timing of the long-awaited customs union could have been better. In the
short term, the country faces a daunting agenda of economic, social and
political problems that will take courage and vision to overcome. <BR>
<BR>
Ataturk's vision was to build and foster a modern industrial state through
government enterprises that would be transferred to the private sector once
they were up and running. More than 70 years later, and despite the incredible
growth of the economy as a whole, most enterprises remain in state hands
and are inefficiently run, over-staffed and kept afloat only with costly
government subsidies. <BR>
<BR>
A financial crisis dogging the state social security system is adding to
the intense pressures on the Turkish Treasury. These have reverberated through
the economy, fuelling levels of inflation 25 times those in the EU. The
average year-to-year increase in the consumer price index over the past
15 years has been between 60% and 65% and is currently over 80%. Some leading
businessmen predict a figure in excess of 100%. <BR>
<BR>
The extent of the government's domestic budget deficit, around $23 billion,
compares quite favourably with some European nations and is not in itself
cataclysmic. But in order to raise the cash to finance its obligations,
the treasury has had to resort to ever shorter terms and ever-higher interest
rates for its T-bills. Three-month bills carry a real interest rate of 25%
- among the highest in the world. <BR>
<BR>
There is the glimmer of a silver lining since high interest rates on Turkish
lira instruments have eased demand from domestic investors for dollars and
deutschmarks. This has allowed the central bank to start rebuilding its
foreign reserves. Other indicators are not so reassuring: last year saw
a widening trade gap. Analysts believe that without rigid austerity measures
the deficit will continue to grow this year. The government estimated a
balance of payments deficit last year at $300 million. In fact, it was more
like $1.5 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Given the nature and scope of the problems it is not surprising that some
political leaders look for a magic wand. For many on the right the answer
is privatisation, but although a privatisation law was passed in 1994 only
a few companies have been sold off and the issue remains highly controversial.
<BR>
<BR>
A prerequisite for major reforms is stable government, but December's election
results produced no clear winner. After weeks of party political bickering,
an uneasy coalition of the business-dominated Motherland Party and agrarian-based
True Path movement led by former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller was formed
in March. <BR>
<BR>
Calling it a personal sacrifice for stability, Ciller - Turkey's first
woman leader - agreed to step aside in favour of Mesut Yilmaz, the
leader of her minority partner Motherland. He will serve as prime minister
for the rest of the year on the understanding she takes the helm again next
year. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Islam's message to the poor </B><BR>
<BR>
The problem is that the coalition is 15 seats short of an overall majority
and its survival will depend on the compliance, or lack of it, of former
prime minister Bulent Ecevit's Democratic Left Party. Waiting in the wings
is the Islamicist Welfare Party led by Necmettin Erbakan, whose policies
would pull Turkey out of the European orbit. <BR>
<BR>
In his search for a coalition partner, Yilmaz flirted briefly with the Islamicists
who already run the city governments in Istanbul and Ankara and who have
achieved wide popularity among the poor. Yilmaz was reportedly warned off
by the Turkish military, a secular force deeply involved in politics. <BR>
<BR>
Whatever the prospects for their marriage of convenience, leaders of the
new government are insisting that their chances of achieving reforms are
better than those of Ciller's previous administration, whose efforts at
tackling social security and privatisation got bogged down in disputes with
her coalition partner, the Democratic Left. Foreign minister Emre Gonensay,
an academic and former adviser to Ciller, says that despite the reported
bitter rivalry between her and the prime minister the coalition parties
&quot;certainly can live together. They see eye to eye on most issues. Their
[election] programmes were almost identical, so it took only a couple of
hours to put a government programme together.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
From his vantage point, President Demirel appears less sanguine about the
government's chances than some ministers. &quot;As long as it is successful,
it will be stable,&quot; he said in an interview with <I>World Link</I>.
&quot;If it is not successful, no matter how it is set up, it will not be
stable. We are just at the start, we don't know how things will go. I think
we should be somewhat patient.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But time may not be on Turkey's side. Prime Minister Yilmaz is making an
aggressive start on the privatisation process but he has barely eight months
of his mandate left and he faces public reservations about the benefits
of a switch to a full market economy, as well as resistance from politicians
used to running the state enterprises. <BR>
<BR>
As Gonensay puts it: &quot;The major opposition comes from vested interests,
from people who will lose their privileged positions either within the enterprise
itself or people who obtain cheap services from these enterprises.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Even President Demirel, a late convert to privatisation, spells out why
resistance remains strong: &quot;It is not easy to get understanding for
privatisation in the first place,&quot; he says. &quot;In state enterprises
there are working people [who wonder] what will happen to their future.
The state enterprises are an accumulation of our national wealth. They are
built with tax money and for years we have been proud of them. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Times have changed and [we] started selling [the enterprises] and
the people are looking at us and saying, 'Why are you selling?' It takes
time [to get the idea across] that we are not giving them away, that we
are not just making some people rich... But I think people are beginning
to realise that [for the state] to continue to operate them is going to
create lots of hardship on the treasury and that is causing inflation.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Gonensay, also a former adviser to the president, is among those who regard
privatisation as a panacea for the nation's economic ills. Asked whether
privatisation alone cure the economic ills, he says: &quot;It will, it will.
Because if it takes care of the accumulated government debt, then the debt
becomes smaller in relation to the financial assets market and interest
rates go down, and that cures most things in the economy.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Difficult economic choices </B><BR>
<BR>
But foreign diplomats and economic analysts say that while privatisation
undoubtedly offers long-term benefits, it is not a cure-all. They argue
for immediate swingeing cuts in a bloated government bureaucracy and agricultural
subsidies, an end to the lira's artificially high value against foreign
currencies, and urgent reform of the tax system to tackle endemic tax avoidance.
It is not an easy choice. Any or all of these options will add to the strains
on a country in which the gap between rich and poor is widening and in which
huge migration to overcrowded cities is weakening family and religious ties,
adding to support for extreme political movements. It is estimated that
three million people exist on the monthly minimum wage of $86, only a quarter
of the amount necessary to enjoy a reasonable standard of living. More than
15% of all households fall below the poverty line. Meanwhile, the creation
of what has been dubbed a &quot;financial parasite class&quot; - those,
for example, with enough spare cash to benefit from overnight bank interest
rates as high as 100% - are adding to social problems. Recent studies
suggest that the wealthiest share more than 60% of the national income.
<BR>
<BR>
Poverty is most extreme in the south-east where the 12-year-old armed struggle
continues against &quot;terrorists&quot; of the Kurdistan Workers' Party
(PKK), who are bent on setting up their own separatist state. International
human rights organisations have documented atrocities on both sides in the
conflict which is a further massive drain on Turkey's resources: the government's
military budget dwarfs funds available for health and education. <BR>
<BR>
Turkey's Human Rights Association (IHD) says the conflict claimed 3,894
lives last year alone. Foreign Minister Gonensay sums up the prevailing
attitude when he says: &quot;The PKK is a terrorist organisation fighting
to dismantle Turkey and there is no case for talking to them.&quot; And
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who seems to have a safe haven in neighbouring
Syria, has begun issuing ominous warnings of Hamas-style suicide attacks.
<BR>
<BR>
Despite the PKK's blood-curdling rhetoric, it is Turkey itself that has
borne the brunt of criticism from its European allies over human rights
abuses, not just in the Kurdish conflict. A recent European visitor to a
carpet factory outside Istanbul was shocked to find girls as young as six
working the looms to produce silk carpets. <BR>
<BR>
According to leading Istanbul banker and former academic Professor Celik
Kurdogu, a founder member of the Foreign Economic Relations Council, says
the root of the problem is a lack of culture and education. What he calls
the &quot;illiteracy&quot; of some police officers leads them to perform
actions that &quot;do not necessarily reflect the views of the ministry
of the interior&quot; or, indeed, of the public at large. In this context,
the professor welcomes a new frankness in the debate about police methods.
<BR>
<BR>
Even so Yavuz Onen, president of the Human Rights Association, remains unconvinced
that the necessary reforms are being made. &quot;In general terms, human
rights violations are continuing and increasing.&quot; he wrote recently.
This sort of criticism is certain to fuel the debate at home and abroad
on the nature of Turkish democracy. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The area's only democratic Muslim state </B><BR>
<BR>
It is hard not to feel some sympathy for the problems facing Turkey in its
determination to succeed as a democratic, secular state with an open market
economy and guaranteed human rights a gateway of ideas and trade between
east and west. It is the only democratic Muslim state in the region, however
fallible its institutions. On its easternmost flank lie the volatile former
Soviet republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. To the south, Iraq
stumbles along under a murderous dictator while Syria sets its own agenda.
In the north, Bulgaria struggles to regain national consciousness and to
the west Greece feels suspicious and threatened. <BR>
<BR>
Despite its present troubles, a World Bank study shows that over the 23-year
period from 1970 Turkey had the third largest growth rate of 22 large economies
in the world. While GDP grew 35.8 times in South Korea and 19.7 times in
Japan, it rose an impressive 12.7 times in Turkey. The country's 1970 GNP
of $11.4 billion rose to $156.4 billion by 1993. Obviously this has produced
some success stories. Petkim, for example, is a publicly owned petrochemical
giant. Although the government still holds a 96% stake, the company under
president Meral Oztekin has begun to function much like a private enterprise,
developing overseas markets to sell realistically priced products. As a
result, the company reported a 469% rise in net profit over 1994 to about
$500 million, after losing $140 million in 1993. The company is now scheduled
for privatisation. <BR>
<BR>
Another bright spot is tourism which has continued to outperform even the
usually over-optimistic official forecasts. After a bumper year in 1995
in which 7.9 million tourists generated $5.l billion in revenue - almost
15% of the country's annual foreign exchange earnings - the government
expects a record 9.5 million visitors this year and $6.5 billion revenue.
<BR>
<BR>
Turkey's car-makers, gearing up for the prospect of increased imports under
the customs union, nevertheless had a good year in 1995. Exports were worth
$272.3 million, an increase of 259%. <BR>
<BR>
Among political and business leaders, there is a optimism that the customs
union will push Turkey into adapting its democratic institutions and business
practices in a push for full EU membership. President Demirel says: &quot;The
customs union will crown Turkey's process of integration with the world
economy. It will help rationalise and modernise Turkey's economic structure
and increased competition will improve the efficiency of its firms. The
opening of the European market will, on the other hand, enable industry
to reach economies of higher scale.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The president is equally aware of the disruptions the union is likely to
cause among Turkey's most vulnerable firms. &quot;There may be some negative
effects in the short run, especially on small and medium-sized enterprises,&quot;
he says. &quot;However, EU [aid will help] support these enterprises.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Foreign Minister Gonensay is just as bullish. &quot;It opens up tremendous
opportunities. That is why the automotive sector has signed an agreement
concurrently with the customs union so that, for example, there will be
a specific Italian world model [of Fiat] manufactured in Turkey alone.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
True to the tradition of Ataturk, President Demirel displays a personal
interest in the huge southeast Anatolia water project (GAP), a massive government-funded
infrastructure programme to dam and use the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates
rivers and hopefully stimulate the poverty-stricken region. The project,
which will regulate the flow of water to Turkey's southern neighbours, is
drawing protests from Syria but Demirel insists it will go ahead to completion.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It has nothing to do with the Arabs,&quot; the president says. &quot;Definitely
we are going to use some part of the flow but no matter how much we use,
they will have [enough]. We are people of goodwill, we are not going to
cause any hardship to those countries. But when you have the border crossing
rivers, you cannot talk about equality, you can talk about equity.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Braced for short-term pain </B><BR>
<BR>
Despite hopes for a greater regional role for Turkey, current efforts to
develop regional economic co-operation between Black Sea states are making
little progress. <BR>
<BR>
But the major need is to get the nation's domestic economic house in order.
That could mean further short-term pain. Despite some immediate public sector
price hikes imposed by the new government, business leaders say more sweeping
austerity measures are required. Many, such as the prestigious Association
of Turkish Industrialists and Businessmen, take a gloomy view of their prospects.
They forecast annual growth this year of just 3.3%, compared to 6.8% last
year. Other analysts predict a further decline next year to a mere 1.2%,
making Turkey the slowest growing country in Europe. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The first impact [of the customs union] may be negative,&quot; says
EU ambassador Lake. &quot;The removal of [tariff] protection need not be
an overnight shock. But there will undoubtedly be a J-curve as things get
worse in the short-term before they get better.&quot; Lake's optimism is
echoed by another foreign envoy who says: &quot;Turkey has tremendous structural
problems in the short term. But it has a dynamic private sector that will
make it one of the biggest emerging market economies of the 21st century.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The eventual wider goal for Turkey, says Gonensay, &quot;is to become part
of Europe and at the same time to extend it: extending the values, the system,
the democracy of Europe gradually towards the east. Europe cannot overlook
the potential problems. We should work together to eliminate these potential
dangers and bring prosperity, peace and stability to this region. It is
a tall order, but it must be done, it cannot be neglected.&quot; <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>
<H3><A NAME="president-demirel"></A>AN EXPERIENCED HAND</H3>
<B>President Suleyman Demirel will need his wealth of experience to lead
the country through a tough period </B><BR>
<BR>
Opponents of Turkey's closer integration with Europe exist both within the
country and outside, and it is important for Turkey's friends and allies
to bear that in mind, says the 72-year-old president, Suleyman Demirel.
<BR>
<BR>
In an interview with <I>World Link</I> at the presidential palace in Ankara,
the veteran statesman and seven-times prime minister said that Turkey's
historic ties with Europe will be strengthened by its recently signed customs
union with the EU. But he warned that while no one should have misconceptions
about Turkey's &quot;irreversible&quot; commitment to a democratic and secular
market democracy, outsiders should realise that the development and perfection
of democratic institutions is a continuing process. <BR>
<BR>
The president insists that Turkey is a peace-loving republic with only goodwill
for its neighbours. He says no one should mistake Turkey's good intentions
for weakness and promises that the country will defend its interests as
necessary. &quot;There are opponents of integration with the west in Turkey
and strong opposition in some neighbouring countries... who will take advantage
of tension in our relations with the west,&quot; the president said. <BR>
<BR>
Demirel, who was elevated to the presidency on the sudden death of Turgut
Ozal in 1993, enjoys limited powers under the Turkish constitution but is
an active foreign ambassador in the cause of Middle East peace and economic
cooperation with the countries of the former Soviet Union. He frequently
reminds his audiences of Turkey's unique position in the region as the only
Muslim state committed to Europe, a free market and the development of a
functioning democracy. On occasion he has shown frustration over attempts
from outside to dictate the pace of Turkey's reform. <BR>
<BR>
He admits to &quot;imperfections&quot; in the present system, but says:
&quot;What we expect from our friends in the west is an understanding that
we are making a genuine effort to correct those imperfections... and that
we have been successful in preserving our democratic life while confronting
the threat of terrorism.&quot; The reference is to the 12-year-old conflict
in southeastern Turkey where the country's armed forces are engaged in a
bitter struggle to put down a rebellion by Kurdish &quot;terrorists&quot;
of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) whose goal is the establishment of
a separate state. <BR>
<BR>
International human rights agencies and other foreign organisations have
long criticised both the Turkish forces and the rebels for their alleged
frequent and widespread use of torture and summary executions of soldiers
and civilians. The EU made it a condition of the customs union that Turkey
amend anti-terrorist laws that made it a crime to speak out against government
policy. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Turkey is being pictured as an incomplete democracy,&quot; the president
complains. &quot;That is the main misconception. However, democracies are
regimes of gradual and sustained search for perfection. We are aware of
our responsibilities and obligations in the field of democracy. It is a
matter of great pride for us that the Turkish people have irreversibly opted
for democracy.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
On the question of how Turkey should handle the PKK conflict, the head of
state says that when people of goodwill offer advice, &quot;instead of telling
them to mind their own business we tell them what our trouble is [and] if
they know the solution they should tell us&quot;. Democracy is a continuing
process: &quot;The participation of the people in this process and realisation
of their aspirations are essential for a standard and workable democracy.
That is what is happening in Turkey. What is also important is to find remedies
for progress when faced with the deficiencies arising from ever-changing
social, economic and political conditions. &quot;As long as this mechanism
works, advancement of a healthy democratic regime is secured. Turkish democracy
is well established and strong enough to overcome difficulties. I have full
confidence in the future of democracy in our country,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
Speaking of his country's role in foreign affairs, the president says the
emergence of new states in the former Soviet Union presents new possibilities,
challenges and opportunities and &quot;Turkey is going to be the link between
Europe and this new continent.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The Middle East also offers opportunities for Turkey and the country is
actively supporting the peace process. &quot;Iraq should become a part of
the international community,&quot; he says. &quot;The whole Arabian peninsula
will eventually come to work together, and here again Turkey is a gateway
to those countries.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Territorial disputes with Greece in the Aegean, which have recently hit
the world's headlines, were not of modern origin but &quot;inherited from
history&quot;, he said. Turkey handed the Dodacanese Islands to Italy before
the Second World War, a decision Ankara says was made under duress. The
victorious powers granted Greece sovereignty in 1947. Athens says Turkey
should refer to dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
&quot;We have disputes with Greece over shoreline and continental shelf
and air space and some of the islands close to Turkey. Turkey is a peace-loving
country [but] if we want peace no one should interpret that as weakness.
It is not weakness, it is wisdom. I do not think anyone should make a miscalculation
over how powerful [the country] is.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
President Demirel says that the customs union must become a solid base on
which to build Turkey's fuller integration with Europe. &quot;In order to
achieve a properly functioning customs union, Turkey should participate
in the EU's decision-making process on an equal footing.&quot; The customs
union, stemming from a 1963 EC/Turkey agreement and a 1971 protocol, is
seen by Ankara as an important step in the whole process. <BR>
<BR>
He says that for the past 50 years, Turkey has participated in practically
all bodies aimed at enhancing European integration and the principal elements
of Turkish foreign policy have converged with those of the EU. &quot;Turkey
will be a genuine part of the economic integration represented by the EU,&quot;
he says. &quot;Successful implementation of the customs union will prepare
Turkey for full membership.&quot;

<H3>FROM THE EDITOR</H3>
<H2>Aim for a national best</H2>

<H4>Hubris is not just a Greek word; all countries must struggle to balance
the demands of the head and heart</H4>


This issue's cover story illustrates a basic point about national entities
which has universal implications. It is that nations, like individuals,
are not always motivated by rational self-interest and do not always &shyp;
correction: rarely &shyp; do what is best for them. Naturally, there is
always a debate about how to de&THORN;ne &quot;best&quot; but often it comes
down to a simple contest between the head and heart. <BR>
<BR>
The head knows that a course of action would make the nation better-off
through trade and increased ties, or create the kind of goodwill which stores
up friends for when you need them most. But the heart cannot help itself,
it simply reacts: responding to events in familiar old ways, de&THORN;ning
itself by opposition or eccentricity: we are good because they are bad,
for example, or: we are not rich or popular, but by god we're special. <BR>
<BR>
Western foreign policy analysts are accustomed to musing about exotic places
with apparently mystifying priorities. Greece, however, is a member of mainstream
institutions and umbilically linked to the history of western civilisation.
As Francis Harris shows, Greece could become a richer and in&THORN;nitely
more in&thorn;uential power if it let go of paranoia and old enmities, hubris
of the past. The country is at a moment of choice: we hope it will choose
well, for its own sake and that of the whole region. <BR>
<BR>
Greece is not the only one in this position. Perhaps every country has a
de&THORN;ning moment in its history which is played out over and over again,
often complicating its progress. Indeed, history turned into &THORN;erce
bloodshed among its Yugoslav neighbours. France still has a complex about
wartime collaboration. Britain arguably gets less out of Europe because
of unresolved memories of empire and its historic hostility to Germany.
The sense of failure suffered in Washington since the Vietnam War &shyp;
admittedly a much more recent memory than the occupation of Athens by Turkey
&shyp; puts a recurrent wrinkle in its foreign policy, stopping it from
intervening when it ought because it once intervened when it ought not have
done so. Quebec and other entities feel the urge to separate from their
larger, largely benevolent partners even if it would leave them worse off.
<BR>
<BR>
It is not a simple matter of bare economic calculation: collective memory
and shared principles are very important to a nation's standing and purpose
and should enter the equation of national interest along with winning contracts
and jobs. Nor is the choice always between head and heart: the range of
the former is sometimes de&THORN;ned in such narrow monetary terms that
it excludes other important and equally rational factors, undermining any
serious development of the concept of national interest. The trick is to
&THORN;nd a balance, to identify what things from the past can help and
what can hinder. <BR>
<BR>
This argument has a very timely application, the latest explosion of &THORN;ghting
in the Middle East. The &quot;grapes of wrath&quot; falling on southern
Lebanon may make the Israeli public feel good, for a while, but like all
other examples of disproportionate force it has signally failed to teach
the enemy a &quot;lesson&quot;. Instead, it has given that enemy another
de&THORN;ning moment which will help keep enmities alive. <BR>
<BR>
Just over a year ago, on this page, our magazine took up the fresh events
of the Barings Bank collapse. We argued then that it showed why all organisations
need good internal controls, unbureaucratic lines of responsibility and
a proper balance between ambition and reality. One year on, the same lessons
are underlined in <I>World Link </I>by the Bank of England's Howard Davies,
who also urges on regulators the kind of cooperation across frontiers which
could match the global scale and reach of business. They are all simple
but key points which bear repeating. <p>

and political system, open to the world, and Russian citizens will be integrated
into international economic and political relations as equal partners...
or power will pass into the hands of forces intent on building a system
of 'nationally oriented capitalism' cut off from the rest of the world.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Of the three books on review, only Vladimir Mau seriously considers the
possibility that the economic, and not just the political, reforms are reversible.
Tellingly, it is the only one written by a Russian. But even Mau, Gaidar's
closest colleague, shares his view that the choice now is between different
sorts of capitalism, the one liberal, the other dependent upon and haltered
by &quot;close state tutelage&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The other two books are both written by westerners deeply involved in the
process of Russian economic reform: Brigitte Granville, a French economist
working on macroeconomic themes and Anders Aslund, a former Swedish diplomat
turned academic and one-time consultant to Russian ministers. Aslund, together
with Professor Jeffrey Sachs, resigned from his advisory function when Gaidar
left government a month after the shocking electoral success of Vladimir
Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party in December 1993. Aslund forecast
(wrongly) a sharp turn for the worse in economic policy. <BR>
<BR>
They are thus all <I>parti pris </I>, and must be read in that light. But
their position puts them inside the process of policy-making and allows
their judgements to be both transparent and informed, a rarity in descriptions
of Russian reform. <BR>
<BR>
The authors all point to how the Gorbachevian reforms, so liberating in
the political and foreign relations fields, rendered the Soviet economy
simply unfunctional, destroying the momentum of the command system without
substituting another. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The economic crisis&quot;, writes Mau, &quot;(was) passing into the
stage of the disintegration of the economic system&quot;. Aslund writes
that: &quot;The national income had fallen at least 20% from the last quarter
of 1991 over that of 1990, and was accelerating. Fear of famine was widespread...
when Gorbachev finally stepped down in December 1991, he left behind a country
in a state of complete and utter collapse.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The second of their services is to call attention to the limited range of
options which faced the first reformers and still face their successors
now. Not one of the former communist states had an easy way out of the command
economy or could have stayed within the system once it began imploding in
the late '80s. The price and labour distortions were so great, the &quot;fit&quot;
with the capitalist world so bad, the competition posed by countries like
China and India so threatening, that they could not continue to mark time.
<BR>
<BR>
But in changing, they had to go through various painful hoops, worse than
any previous capitalist birth. First, they had to get rid of an ideology
which had a grip not just on the elite, a section of which proved open to
change, but also on the population at large. Russia was the toughest nut
in this respect: a people used to the securities of socialism preserved
a dislike of speculation, market behaviour and open inequalities. <BR>
<BR>
This has created an open field for the very large class of Russian political
demagogues to the left and right as Mau, more concerned with the political
dimension than the other two authors, points out very well. Yet this has
been less due to the failures and mistakes of reform of which there have
been many, detailed in all three books, than to the successes: higher prices,
the speed of Russian privatisation, tight monetary policies and the sudden
access to wealth by a conspicuous few. <BR>
<BR>
Are such reactions likely to deliver a communist or authoritarian nationalist
to the Kremlin this June - and will he then usher in capitalism &quot;under
state tutelage&quot; or worse? Naturally the books, all finished by early
last year, neither answer these questions nor speculate. But they all point
to the constraints any such figure will face. For Russia is now continuing
a rather stumbling reform in a straitjacket of support from the IMF: its
officials have already said that they are prepared to work with any Russian
president but will only continue support if he conforms to the conditions
already agreed with President Boris Yeltsin and his government. <BR>
<BR>
Naturally, a communist or nationalist government is free to decline this
support. But the effect of doing so would require more than state tutelage.
To avoid collapse, it would require an even greater sacrifice by the population
than they have experienced so far. As dissatisfaction took hold and spread,
there would have to be increasing state control over not just economic lives
but over society as a whole. <BR>
<BR>
It has been, as Granville notes, &quot;a very Russian success story&quot;.
The leap in the dark has been made, in a typically hasty Russian way. Russia's
most likely course is to continue to try to find its way to the light, not
to return to the heart of darkness. <BR>

<H4>The Collapse of Barings </H4>
<I>By Stephen Fay<BR>
Richard Cohen Books, &#163;20 <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reviewed by Paul Durman</B></I><B> </B><BR>
<BR>
When Nick Leeson finally emerges from his Singaporean jail, he could do
worse than consider a new career in public relations. Leeson is the financial
trader whose fraudulent dealings racked up &#163;860 million of losses and
bankrupted one of Britain's oldest investment banks. From this inauspicious
start to life in the public eye, he has secured a remarkably sympathetic
press. With the help of his wife and lawyers, he has managed to cast himself
as the victim of the men who ran Barings. <BR>
<BR>
Leeson has blamed himself for &quot;trying to help people too much&quot;,
in other words for striving too hard to earn the profits on which his colleagues
relied for their bonuses. His own lively account of his downfall (<I>Rogue
Trader</I>, published by Little, Brown at &#163;16.99) has become a bestseller.
<BR>
<BR>
Stephen Fay does not buy Leeson's account. In <I>The Collapse of Barings</I>,
he sets out the case for the prosecution. He rejects Leeson's claim that
he slipped into illicit trading gradually after first trying to cover up
a colleague's mistake. Instead, he argues that Leeson started to cheat and
deceive almost as soon as he arrived in Singapore. <BR>
<BR>
This is an extraordinary tale. From the outside the investment banking and
securities industry seems a tightly regulated world, tied up in rules, watched
over by a host of compliance officers and auditors. Yet Leeson cut through
all this with tactics of startling simplicity. <BR>
<BR>
He conducted unauthorised trading in futures and options contracts through
an error account, supposedly intended for sorting out small discrepancies.
By arranging trades between the memorably numbered 88888 account and other
in-house accounts, he created huge bogus profits for Barings. He also used
it to dump his mounting losses. Within two years of transferring from his
job as a humble settlements clerk, Leeson had become one of Singapore's
star traders. Barings eventually sent hundreds of millions of pounds to
support a little understood operation run by an inexperienced 27-year-old.
<BR>
<BR>
Fay has many acid remarks to make about the Barings executives who failed
to pick up the numerous warning signals and who readily accepted Leeson's
clumsy forgeries and inconsistent explanations. However, he rightly dismisses
the conspiracy theorists who believe Leeson acted with others. Belief in
a conspiracy is strongest among those who are anxious to play down their
own role in the disaster, including some of Barings' senior managers and
the Singaporean financial authorities. <BR>
<BR>
According to Fay, the bank's demise was made possible by its recent history.
The culture clash between the conservative risk-shy bankers of Baring Brothers
and the entrepreneurial traders of Baring Securities - phenomenally
successful in the '80s - was unresolved. The merger put executives
with little experience of futures and options in key positions. It also
obscured some of the financial exposures within Baring Securities, a problem
compounded by a clumsy informal concession from the Bank of England which
made it unnecessary for Barings to monitor closely the scale of lending
to its securities business. <BR>
<BR>
Dealings with Singapore were complicated by the fierce independence of the
local senior management. Misunderstandings about the extent of Leeson's
responsibilities and disputes about chains of command allowed him to work
with minimal supervision. <BR>
<BR>
In a fundamental breach of best practice, Leeson was in charge of both futures
trading and settlement. Weaknesses in systems meant important financial
information was difficult or impossible to obtain. Finally, Leeson was helped
by the extraordinary willingness of his Singaporean staff to carry out his
instructions unquestioningly. <BR>
<BR>
What Fay cannot explain is why Leeson went off the rails in July 1992. Before
he went to Singapore, Leeson had made a good impression at Barings. <BR>
<BR>
Could there be a Barings II? Wrong question, says Fay. The extent of ignorance
about derivatives trading makes it safe to assume that similar disasters
are already developing.

<H4>What is Life? The Next 50 Years </H4>
<I>Edited by Michael Murphy and Luke O'Neill <BR>
Cambridge University Press, &#163;17.95 <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reviewed by Lance Knobel </B></I><BR>
<BR>
In February 1943, the Nobel-prize-winning physicist Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger
gave a series of lectures at Trinity College, Dublin. Instead of focusing
on his own field of theoretical physics (Schr&ouml;dinger was one of the
founders of quantum mechanics), the exile from Nazi-occupied Austria discussed
two themes: the nature of heredity and the thermodynamics of living systems.
<BR>
<BR>
Although he claimed to be a &quot;naive physicist&quot;, Schr&ouml;dinger
reached a prescient conclusion about the gene. He predicted the shape of
what he termed the &quot;aperiodic crystal&quot; and that it would store
a code within its structure. <BR>
<BR>
When the structure of DNA was discovered the following decade, Schr&ouml;dinger
was proved right. Published as <I>What is Life?</I> in 1944, Schr&ouml;dinger's
self-described &quot;little book&quot; was enormously influential. Both
Francis Crick and James Watson, the discoverers of the structure of DNA,
credit the book as a key influence in their decision to study the structure
of the gene. <BR>
<BR>
On the 50th anniversary of Schr&ouml;dinger's lectures, a group of eminent
scientists gathered in Dublin to ask fundamental questions of biology again.
The resulting book is again &quot;little&quot; (although nearly twice the
length of Schr&ouml;dinger's original), but it contains some fascinating
speculation on what scientists may be able to answer in the next 50 years.
This enquiry is particularly important because if the 20th century is seen
as the century when physics dramatically transformed the world - through
atomic weapons and nuclear power, solid-state physics leading to the computer,
the impact of relativistic thinking - the next century is likely to
be most affected by biology. <BR>
<BR>
According to the scientists in the current volume, however, the next 50
years could contain as many frustrations as successes. Embryologist Lewis
Wolpert does not believe that the egg will be entirely computable within
the next 50 years. In other words, even given complete understanding of
the initial conditions of the fertilised egg, the full development process
will not be predictable: the fine details are too complex. Manfred Eigen,
like some of the other authors, declines the long view and instead confines
himself to problems that will remain at the end of this century. One that
will be unsolved, he believes is the discovery of an effective AIDS therapy.
<BR>
<BR>
Jared Diamond looks at the evolution of human inventiveness. He convincingly
argues that what he calls the Great Leap Forward in human behaviour resulted
from the development of modern language. That, far more than brain size
or the ability to stand upright, separates us from our ape forebears. Diamond
believes the next 50 years should bring important advances in understanding
how language - and thus human creativity - originated. <BR>
<BR>
One of the essays is by a non-scientist, Ruth Braunizer, who is Schr&ouml;dinger's
daughter. She understandably does not offer any scientific speculation,
but hers may be the most revealing of essays. Reflecting on the influences
on Schr&ouml;dinger in early 20th century Vienna, Braunizer emphasises the
broad-based, humanistic education available to all children, including those
from very poor families. &quot;A member of that generation, whatever their
occupation... would, for instance, have been able to enjoy Plato or Seneca
in the original without seeking the help of a dictionary or a commentary.
Consequently, they were also masters of their own language,&quot; she writes.
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, Braunizer reports on how she received a poorly written, mis-spelled
letter from a promising young physicist: &quot;Obviously in our time you
can get ahead without bothering about culture. The incident raises several
questions. Are we just looking at the result of specialisation? My father
dreaded specialisation and strove to be a generalist in every way. But this
was the mark of his generation.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Schr&ouml;dinger was a remarkable physicist, but he was particularly startling
in having such a profound influence outside his field with <I>What is Life?
</I>Given the global spread of specialisation, in science as well as in
other fields, the prospects for future Schr&ouml;dingers look bleak indeed.

<H4> The World Economic Forum is today the foremost international membership
organization integrating leaders from business, government and academia into a
partnership committed to improving the state of the world. Through global,
efficient, direct, personalized and highest-level interaction, the World Economic
Forum serves its members and constituents to define their agenda for action. The
core community of the World Economic Forum are the 1,000 foremost global
companies.

Incorporated since 1971 as a foundation, the World Economic Forum is independent,
impartial and not-for-profit, tied to no political, partisan or national
interests. It has consultative status with the United Nations. The motto of the
World Economic Forum is "Entrepreneurship in the global public interest".</H4>

 Members of the World Economic Forum
are not individuals but companies, which are represented at the highest level of
management. Each member should be characterised by:<BR> <BR> * its global
dimension or the strategy to grow in that direction <BR> <BR> * a top management
that is forward-looking and of high reputation <BR> <BR> * a healthy organisation
- respected, growing and ethical.<BR> <BR> The World Economic Forum
currently has two categories of membership: <BR> <BR> <B>Foundation
Membership</B> <BR> <BR> In principle, Foundation membership is made up of the
1,000 foremost global enterprises. In addition to the above general criteria,
each is characterised by the following specific attributes:<BR> <BR> * a
significant role in shaping the future of its industry and/or region <BR> <BR> *
the ability and willingness of its top management to contribute to international
cooperation and economic and social progress. <BR> <BR> <B>Global Growth Company

fastest-growing business groups. Each is characterised by the following specific
attributes:<BR> <BR> * a significant role in shaping its industry as a niche
producer, a technological leader or an entrepreneurial innovator <BR> <BR> * the
ability and willingness of its top management to network with like-minded
enterprises around the world. <BR> <BR> In order to integrate the advice of its
members into the decision-making process of the Foundation, the Council of the

Mercosur Economic Summit </H3> <H4>Buenos Aires </H4> <B>23-25 June </B><BR> <BR>
The second Mercosur Economic Summit will examine the trends in capital flows and
direct investment in the Mercosur region. What will be the impact of the recently
signed framework agreement between the European Union and the Mercosur nations?
Will it lead to the creation of the world's largest free-trade zone? Will this in
turn divert attention from the much touted hemispheric integration? <BR> <BR> We
will also look at some very real issues that today's chief executives must
confront to truly understand the region. What is the status of the Plano Real in
Brazil, and what will be done to sustain it? How can governments of the region
bridge the painful period of necessary economic reforms with the longer term
pay-off these reforms will bring to the greater public? What concrete steps are
being taken to increase domestic savings and investment? What kind of education
policy is needed to produce the high-quality goods and services that will be
competitive on global markets? This is especially relevant considering that the
Mercosur countries are currently contending with high unemployment. <H3>1996 Asia
Summits </H3> <B>Three exceptional Summits this autumn will bring businessmen up
to date on the latest economic, financial and business developments taking place
in the most dynamic part of the world.</B> <H3>China Business Summit </H3>
<H4>Beijing </H4> <B>16-18 September </B><BR> <BR> Bolstered by a sustained
period of growth, China must now contain inflationary pressures and rein in the
development of some of its most successful provinces. Our Summit will address the
most salient questions related to this new phase of economic maturity and the
place foreign investors can find for themselves in the newly reshaped
environment. As the handover of Hong Kong approaches, participants may also be
able to assess China's new role on the world's economic scene and the complexity
of its position among other fledgling markets in the Asia-Pacific region. <BR>
<BR> Senior government officials, top Chinese and foreign experts, Chinese
business leaders, as well as senior executives from companies involved in China,
will be the key discussion partners during the Summit. There will be ample time
for private contacts and dialogue between senior executives and heads of major
Chinese corporations and their foreign counterparts. The Summit is being held in
partnership with the China Enterprise Management Association (CEMA) under the
patronage of the State Economic and Trade Commission. <H3>India Economic Summit
</H3> <H4>New Delhi </H4> <B>27-29 October </B><BR> <BR> Following India's June
elections our Summit will be a unique opportunity to meet with key members of the
new cabinet and thus help to relieve foreign investors' uncertainties concerning
the future course of liberalization. <BR> <BR> Two key issues to be addressed at
the Summit (held in partnership with the Confederation of Indian Industry, CII)
will be identifying new opportunities for partnerships and cooperation and
improving the environment for domestic and foreign companies as the Indian
economy builds up on current strong results, especially in the industrial sector.
<H3>Europe/East Asia Economic Summit </H3> <H4>Hong Kong </H4> <B>18-20 November
</B><BR> <BR> &quot;Partnership in Growth&quot;: the fifth Europe/East Asia
Economic Summit (held in partnership with the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council) will reflect the enhanced business, trade, financial and technological
ties between these two industrialized poles and will thus constitute the most
welcome business complement to this year's government summit. Given the backing
of EU governments, European enterprises are now gearing up for overseas expansion
in an effort to boost their competitiveness in Asia. The Summit programme will
draw attention to some new trends in Asian investment in Europe. As the Summit
will be the last opportunity for high-level discussions before the WTO
ministerial meeting in Singapore, trade issues will feature prominently on the
agenda. <BR> <BR> Special sessions on provinces of China, Hong Kong and specific
regions and countries in Asia and Europe will provide participants with the
possibility to discuss economic prospects and new business openings. There will
also be sector-specific discussions and project presentations allowing
participants to promote new business projects and to identify potential partners.
<H3>1996 Central and Eastern European <BR> Economic Summit </H3> <H4>Salzburg
</H4> <B>7-9 July </B><BR> <BR> With high growth rates and favourable economic
indicators, the region of Central and Eastern Europe is one of the world's
greatest untapped markets and it stands on the threshold of rapid development and
business expansion. For years, the World Economic Forum has pioneered the opening
of the countries of this area and their integration into the global economy. Now,
the World Economic Forum welcomes the international business community to the
first Central and East European Economic Summit under the patronage of President
Thomas Klestil of Austria. <BR> <BR> The focus of the Summit is on the countries
of the region and their neighbours -- Austria, Germany and Russia. The Summit
will stress the importance of the region as a whole in the wider European
context. It will point to the need to develop both the infrastructure and the
business links capable of raising local capital, attracting foreign investment
and promoting trade and industry. We also will look closely at the thrust towards
European integration and the search for collective security arrangements. <BR>
<BR> High-ranking government and business leaders from all over the world will
discuss the prospects of the emerging market and conditions for achieving
permanent and stable growth. Looking at trade routes rather than national
boundaries, the Summit will pay special attention to private-sector initiatives
and cross-border projects that are transforming this eastern part of Europe into
a major global economic force. <H3>1996 Middle East/North Africa <BR> Economic
Summit </H3> <H4>Cairo </H4> <B>12-14 November </B><BR> <BR> The Middle
East/North Africa region is undergoing significant political, economic and social
changes. Despite political turbulence, the region as a whole remains dedicated to
the reconciliation process. In addition to ongoing economic reforms which are
intended to create an environment conducive to doing business, governments
together with the private sector are now exploring multilateral cooperation
projects. <BR> <BR> The emphasis of the 1996 Summit will be on new
outward-looking strategies required for the future. It will focus on the Middle
East/North Africa as an identifiable region, able and eager to compete in the
global economy. It will emphasize the need to develop both infrastructure and
business links capable of raising capital, attracting foreign investment and
promoting trade and industry. <H3>Spring 1996 </H3> <H4>France Meeting, Paris 5

<H3>TECHNOLOGY</H3> 
<H2>It wood save energy </H2>
<H4>Plant-burning is regarded as a primitive form of energy but new approaches
could make it a hot property</H4>
&quot;A century ago, nearly half of all agriculture was devoted to an energy
crop: the oats given to horses which we used for transport. Historically,
agriculture has always provided fuel, so why do people look at me as if
I'm mad when I say we could do it again?&quot; asks Peter Billins, head
of British Biogen. <BR>
<BR>
He is accustomed to defending what is often dismissed as an old-fashioned
approach to finding new sources of energy. His company searches for new
ways of producing power from burning crops and agricultural or forestry
waste and he is proud to call himself both green and a businessman. <BR>
<BR>
But people are usually surprised to learn that plant-burning, a form of
energy known as biomass, is not only environmentally acceptable but under
the right conditions highly beneficial. <BR>
<BR>
Doubts arise because of fears about global warming: even the most elementary
knowledge of chemistry suggests that wood-burning creates carbon dioxide,
which has identified as one of the principal causes of rising world temperatures.
The clearing of the rain forest, often called the lungs of the world because
the vital role plants play in creating oxygen, is another threat. But biomass
creates relatively few pollutants and its proponents say it is different
from energy-generating incineration schemes where contaminants such as heavy
metals are a potential problem. <BR>
<BR>
The science behind the current enthusiasm for biomass is sufficiently attractive
to appeal even to multinational oil companies such as the Anglo-Dutch giant
Shell, which is pumping millions of dollars into research projects, most
notably in Brazil. <BR>
<BR>
Like fossil fuels, biomass generates carbon dioxide, but this simply represents
the release of the gas which the plant absorbed as it grew. The burning
of fossil fuels, on the other hand, releases a reservoir of carbon stored
up millions of years ago alongside high levels of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide.
In addition, it is impossible to replace fossil fuel stocks. But if so-called
fuel crops are replaced, then biomass can be replenished indefinitely. <BR>
<BR>
Take wood. As long as new trees are replanted as older ones are felled,
the process is a simple energy cycle. As the tree grows, carbon dioxide
is broken down into oxygen and cellulose: as it burns the two recombine
to form the gas again. Unlike oil-burning, no new carbon is released and
the process becomes beneficial if the energy created replaces a fossil-fuel
alternative. <BR>
<BR>
So what materials are suitable? Forestry provides the most obvious fuel.
Burning wood has, after all, a long track-record as a source of energy production
and even today scientists estimate that some 16% of the world's energy demands
are met by wood. Unfortunately, the bulk of this is in the developing world
in countries such as Indonesia, where it may account for 70% of a poor nation's
fuel consumption. Most of this is burnt on inefficient stoves which are
used for both cooking and domestic heating. In practice this is often non-renewable,
since land cleared of trees usually becomes permanently agricultural. It
can also result in damaging erosion, as in the Himalayas. <BR>
<BR>
As nations develop, reliance on biomass tends to weaken: India receives
only half of its energy needs from biomass with the rest coming from oil,
coal and gas. Until recently economists have favoured this process. arguing
for cash-generating growth to fund the transition to oil, but now scientists
are developing alternative technologies which harness biomass more efficiently.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Trees that replace themselves </B><BR>
<BR>
In Europe, attention has centred on a new look at the centuries-old art
of coppicing, which harnesses the natural ability of many trees to regenerate
themselves from their roots. As anyone who has chopped down a willow knows,
within weeks of felling a problem tree, new withies spring from the stump.
Naturally, modern coppicing has refined traditional methods. Most important
is the use of new fast-growing hybrid strains of willow and poplar which
grow at up to four metres a year and can be harvested every two years. <BR>
<BR>
Using this young wood makes good economic and environmental sense because
a tree's growth is proportionately greatest during its early years. The
concept is sufficiently encouraging to draw EU funding for three research
projects in Denmark, Italy and the UK although Sweden leads the way with
9,000 hectares of deciduous coppice. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, its output can be boosted with forestry residues such as smaller
branches, roots, bark and mill-waste which are otherwise commercially valueless.
These are then chipped to make handling easier and to increase the efficiency
of the combustion process. Until recently this type of material would have
been burnt in a conventional generator, where the heat of combustion produces
the steam that drives a turbine. Now, however, new technology has been brought
in to improve efficiency. This uses intense heat and pressure to convert
the chips into gasses and it is these, rather than steam, which drive the
turbines. <BR>
<BR>
The results of research so far are encouraging, in particular that pioneered
by Shell at its Brazilian plant where forestry residues are used to fuel
a gassification process. The findings suggest up to nearly half of available
energy can be converted into electricity, compared with around a quarter
in a conventional coal plant, outstripping the inefficiencies of traditional
biomass production by a factor of at least four. <BR>
<BR>
A further attraction of the new biomass is that regardless of where the
technology is developed, the underlying efficiencies remain the same. To
be competitive against fossil fuels, plants have to find their bulky fuels
locally. A UK government study, for example, calculates that to make wood-burning
stations viable the timber would have to come from within a 15km radius
of the plant. Even a moderately sized 50mw facility would require 3,500
hectares of woodland to fuel it. As a result, across most of the developed
world there has been a reluctance to invest, because until farmers show
themselves prepared to grow fuel crops, no investor is likely to risk the
capital outlay that even a moderate power station requires. Conversely,
until a market is proven few farmers are prepared to risk the time and effort
on an experimental crop. <BR>
<BR>
So far, therefore, research has concentrated on small-output technology
ideal for poorer nations. In Indonesia, whose population of some 200 million
is spread over 17,500 islands, conventional power distribution networks
are less useful and nearly half of all villages are without electrical power.
The country is not short of biomass, however, hosting plentiful supplies
of forestry and agricultural waste which can be used to fuel small local
generators. <BR>
<BR>
This in turn can be used to power cash-generating schemes such as floriculture
and higher-margin horticulture, such as irrigation pumps and greenhouse
cooling systems. <BR>
<BR>
In a country such as Indonesia agricultural residues are the only way to
produce power for the mass of people, explains Roger King, chief executive
of the consultancy Ecosolve which helps convert EU aid grants into working
projects in Indonesia, Malaysia and India. In particular, sugar cane produces
a wealth of burnable by-products: &quot;For a long time sugar factories
have generated enough energy for their own needs but it has been very wasteful,
not to mention polluting,&quot; King says. <BR>
<BR>
The industry produces four categories of waste: cane tops, fibrous residue
left in the presses, filter cake from clarifiers and liquid waste full of
nitrogen, phosphates and potassium nutrients. Conventionally, the first
of these were used as animal feeds while the remaining waste has all too
often been left to rot or simply drain into the nearest river system. <BR>
<BR>
Using modern but relatively simple technology, however, these can be processed
to produce both power and fertiliser, using a combination of gassification,
composting and anaerobic digestion. Better still, the schemes can markedly
improve the local environment. Many of the potential fuels such as tapioca
trimmings are otherwise very polluting, having a high chemical oxygen demand
(COD), which means they require a lot of oxygen to break down and emit methane,
one of the worst greenhouse gases. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Turning harmful waste to use </B><BR>
<BR>
Ecosolve tackles the problems of high COD-value crops by stewing the minced
waste in an anaerobic digestor. This produces methane, which is burnt in
a small generator, and slurry which can be used as a fertiliser: &quot;You
avoid pollution while creating two valuable products for local farmers,&quot;
says King. &quot;Its all rather beautiful, really.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Another vast potential source of electricity across the Pacific Basin comes
from rice husks: one conservative estimate puts India's annual production
of this otherwise useless agricultural waste at 15 million tonnes. <BR>
<BR>
Change certainly seems to be in the air. The World Bank seems to agree that
biomass requires serious attention and is currently funding trials into
sugar waste with five projects in Indonesia alone. Estimates put the level
of new, efficient, biomass currently being created around the world at about
15,000 to 20,000mw. This is not much, but enough to suggest the possible
beginnings of a trend. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I am sure there is a growing role for biomass,&quot; says Billins
confidently. &quot;After all, most people are surprised to learn some 5%
of America's energy comes from wood and Oregon relies on forestry for 40%
of its electricity. Better still, the most recent advances are being spearheaded
by both the US and developing nations. I think the rest of the world will
want to follow.&quot;

<H3>TIME OUT</H3>
<H2>Vlad the imbiber </H2>
<H4>Food and drink in the colourful port city on the eastern edge of Russia
is beginning to reflect its Pacific variety </H4>

Think of a city on the coast of a great continent, its population close
to a million. Place it at the end of one of the world's most famous railways.
Make it a great port and naval headquarters, a centre of trade, transport
and culture. For the final touch of spice imagine the city's cosmopolitan
history, followed by half a century of secrecy in which foreigners were
unable to visit. <BR>
<BR>
Sound like an exciting place to be? Well, Vladivostok is exciting. As a
place to work there is never a dull moment. As somewhere to live, it is
more than redeemed from the drearyness of its Soviet-style outskirts by
the crumbling turn-of-the-century town centre, with wonderful views across
the port, the shipyards and the Pacific Ocean. <BR>
<BR>
But for those wanting a good time, or even just a relaxing evening in a
pleasant restaurant, things are a bit more complicated. Vladivostok has
the image of a mafia-run &quot;Wild East&quot; frontier town. Visitors from
outside debate in hushed tones whether it is safe to go out at night. &quot;Isn't
this the most crime-ridden city in Russia?&quot; they ask. <BR>
<BR>
Fortunately for the average visitor, the truth is that it does not matter.
The crime rate may be high but most of it is economic, linked to dodgy port
dealings such as smuggling or illegal immigration, especially from China.
Unless you are involved with the mafia, violent crime is much less prevalent
than in comparable cities in the US or Europe. <BR>
<BR>
That being said, the notion of mafia in its widest Russian definition -
<I>biznizmen</I> of varying degrees of honesty and their associates -
is useful for the visitor when it comes to the choice of an evening hangout.
A place frequented by the mafia is known by locals as <I>krutoi</I>. Sadly
for the ordinary folk of Vladivostok the <I>krutoi</I> category has greatly
outpaced the non-<I>krutoi</I> in recent years. <BR>
<BR>
Unlike Moscow and St Petersburg, where Russian and western fast-food venues
or modest bistros and cafes have sprung up to cater for the middle market,
Vladivostok eateries are few and affordable mostly by the rich and foreign.
For ordinary folk entertainment remains largely home-based, with the occasional
shindig put on by the workplace for special occasions. <BR>
<BR>
There are exceptions. The city now has a real coffee bar, opened last year
by a woman who, according to rumour, got her espresso machine from her son
in Italy. The tiny bar serves such delights as cappuccino, latte and espresso
and received harsh reviews in the local newspaper for its ban on smoking.
<BR>
<BR>
There is also a genuine pizza joint, around the back of the Gorky Theatre.
Those who know this obscure corner of town will find that $10 buys a delicious
pie, made by trained chefs in authentic pizza ovens. Apart from the frequent
power cuts, which afflict all but the most upmarket restaurants, there is
just one catch: the Pearl Pizzeria can run out of such ingredients as mushrooms
and tomatoes. It is still aeons ahead of the longer-established Magic Burger,
Vladivostok's first attempt at a fast-food restaurant. Fabulously situated
on Svetlanskaya Street, the city's main drag, the restaurant serves cheap,
unsightly burgers and huge slabs of soggy pizza to hungry shoppers. <BR>
<BR>
There is supposedly another fast-food restaurant in the Hotel Primorye,
recently opened as a Russian-Korean joint venture and promising to cater
to the average Vlad citizen. The managers said they would serve American,
Chinese and Korean fast food in addition to the usual Russian fare. What
is more, a notice on the door declares unheard-of opening times: from 7am
to midnight. But a visitor would be unwise to rely on such information.
The Restaurant Primorye has frequently been closed at 8pm and even on its
opening night suffered the indignity of a long power cut. <BR>
<BR>
Among regular restaurants the choice is essentially between Russian and
oriental cuisine. Looking at Vladivostok, a perfectly ordinary Russian city
with an almost entirely Russian population, it is easy to forget that this
is east Asia. Moscow is an eight-hour flight away, while China and Korea
are on the doorstep and Japan just across the sea. <BR>
<BR>
Signs of Vlad's Pacific Rim location are everywhere in the business and trading
relationships that have sprung up since the city opened up to the world
four years ago. Shops and kiosks are filled with imports from South Korea,
Japan and China, with Australia and the US next in line. The majority of
cars are secondhand Japanese, and far outnumber Russian ones. The foreign
business community is made up primarily of Japanese and Koreans. There is
scarcely a European country whose expatriate numbers reach double figures.
Britain just makes it, thanks to the croupiers at the Casino Club Versailles.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hidden but good </B><BR>
<BR>
With all Vlad restaurants, you should eat by nine in the evening or you
may have a problem. The Versailles Hotel, an elegantly restored establishment
partly owned by the Far Eastern Shipping Company - and still the only
quality place to remain in the town centre - may be persuaded to serve
guests until the advertised time of ten-thirty but only under protest. <BR>
<BR>
It is worth persevering. By Vladivostok standards, the Versailles's food
is good and the menu more imaginative than the usual variations on chicken
and chips, meat and chips, fish and chips or the traditional Russian meat
dumplings known as <I>pelmeni</I> that form the standard menu in most restaurants.
<BR>
<BR>
Round the corner from the Versailles is another well-hidden restaurant in
the capacious Okean cinema complex. Until recently it was run by a couple
of foreigners with a regional Fosters beer concession but they gave up after
struggling with turning a profit with so many hands reaching into the till.
<BR>
<BR>
Even under Russian management, however, the Okean is pleasantly different
from most Vlad establishments. For one thing it has panoramic windows overlooking
the ocean and a bright, spacious dining room with pretty wooden furniture.
Nets and sea shells hanging from the ceiling place it on the cheerful side
of tacky, while the unpretentious atmosphere keeps away the <I>krutoi</I>
contingent. The English translations on the menu have taken a dive since
the change in management, but most people can work out what &quot;mashrooms&quot;
and &quot;sheece&quot; mean. The scallops in walnut sauce are definitely
to be recommended. <BR>
<BR>
Finding good fish is one of the many puzzles of Vladivostok, for although
fishing is a significant part of the local economy, much of the finest seafood
is exported. Furthermore, since fishing like everything else in the former
Soviet Union was organised on a huge scale, it is much more difficult than
you would expect to find seafood that is fresh as opposed to canned or frozen.
<BR>
<BR>
Excellent seafood platters are available at the fancier restaurants. But
perhaps the best in town is served at the Vlad Motor Inn, highly priced
and the only hotel under foreign management. Planted in the wooded area
packed with weekend <I>dachas</I>, about 20 kilometres outside the city,
the Russian-Canadian joint-venture motel is a favourite expat and New Russian
hangout. <BR>
<BR>
This collection of pre-fabricated buildings includes guest rooms, a business
centre, a small restaurant and a bar. In Canada it would not attract a second
look. But in Vladivostok it is best hotel in the area, home to the entire
expatriate staff of the US consulate and other international business people.
The restaurant is locally famous for such luxuries as American steaks, Diet
Coke and that great Russian rarity, smiling waitresses. It also serves a
fantastic Kamchatka crab, which arrives on an outsized platter that barely
accommodates the creature's 30cm legs. <BR>
<BR>
But it will be some time before visiting Vlad is a culinary or socially
pleasurable experience. Food and nightlife, after all, are not what brings
most people to Russia.

<H3>BACKSEAT</H3>
<H3>Charles Darwent takes a stroll down the Via Veritas with famous fans
of the fermented grape </H3>
As the days draw out and sap quickens in the leaf, I would ask you to spare
a thought for Mr J&uuml;rgen Schrempp. <BR>
<BR>
Mr Schrempp, you will recall, is the chairman of German car manufacturers,
Daimler-Benz. It is not on this count that he is deserving of our sympathy,
however. If Mr Schrempp's name is familiar to you, it is less likely to
be because of his car-making proclivities than from press reports concerning
a recent business trip he made to Rome. <BR>
<BR>
While in the Italian capital Mr Schrempp - like many a north European
before him - found his chilly veins suddenly enlivened by the hotter
blood of the <I>dolce vita</I>: more specifically, by the particular therms
to be found in that beaker-full of the warm South beloved of the poet Keats.
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, an admirably thorough-minded Mr Schrempp would appear to have worked
his way through a number of such beakers in the course of his researches
into Keatsian thermodynamics: a fact that led the Roman police to pull him
over as he wove his way, in an allegedly erratic fashion, back to his hotel
one sultry night. <BR>
<BR>
Not unnaturally, the German plutocrat viewed the attentions of the <I>carabanieri</I>
as tending to the unpoetic and told them so. In fact, if police reports
are to be believed, Mr Schrempp called into question the marital status
of his interlocutors' various parents and then suggested they perform a
physical act which, while doubtless satisfying in its way, might have caused
a raising of the eyebrows among any passers-by on the Via Condotti. <BR>
<BR>
The notable thing about this story is not so much the shockingly ungallant
behaviour of the Roman police as the way it was subsequently reported in
the world's press. When, some 20 years before, the British politician George
Brown was accused by the London constabulary of being in a similarly poetic
state, the parliamentarian's riposte - that he was &quot;tired and
emotional&quot; - won him more instant popularity with the nation's
journalists than any amount of tax-cutting. <BR>
<BR>
Here, reasoned British scribblers, was precisely the kind of man whose (slightly
tremulous) hand was required to guide the national tiller: not just the
sort of chap who knew a good thing when he drank it, but one who could summon
up the wit to brazen things out, even if he had done so more frequently
than might usually be considered wise. In the course of time, George Brown
was duly elevated to the peerage as Lord George Brown and the phrase &quot;tired
and emotional&quot; to its equivalent philological pantheon, the Oxford
English Dictionary. <BR>
<BR>
Not so the unfortunate Schrempp. Twenty years on, the sound that echoed
around the world's editorial offices when news of the German's unexpected
interest in viniculture clattered over the wire was not that of thighs being
slapped, but of lips being pursed. There were calls among the more censorious
of German titles for his resignation. Happy to relate, the heroic company
chief refused to do any such thing, thus narrowly avoiding becoming a sort
of St Sebastian of the chianti bottle. <BR>
<BR>
For this Mr Schrempp deserves our thanks. Time was when the correlation
between corporate seniority and the <I>vie luxe</I> was an automatic one.
With promotion to the board came keys to those dual (and by no means unconnected)
symbols of executive success, the directors' lavatory and the boardroom
drinks cabinet. Until recently, anthropologists on Wall Street or Threadneedle
Street could chart the progression of their subjects through the plutocratic
ranks by the growing redness of their noses. <BR>
<BR>
Were one to look for a single Darwinian apophthegm to describe this process,
it might be the phrase &quot;the survival of the fattest&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
No more. Where a distinctly plump Sir Winston Churchill could lead Britain
to wartime victory on a diet whose alcohol-by-volume would have killed the
average navvy stone dead, Mr Bill Clinton is a teetotaller who escapes the
arduousness of life in the Oval Office by going jogging. <BR>
<BR>
Where the Great, Good and Merely Very Rich were once recognisable by their
expensively purchased avoirdupois, aspirant golddiggers nowadays turn their
attentions to the most cadaverous person in any gilded room. Society, from
New York to New Zealand, is dominated by the &quot;social xray&quot;, as
Mr Tom Wolfe describes it in his novel, <I>Bonfire of the Vanities</I>:
a wraith-like figure subsisting entirely on lo-cal canapes and aerated mineral
water. Such pockets of resistance to this New Puritanism as stubbornly persist
- one thinks with particular fondness of Russia's president Mr Boris
Yeltsin in this regard - are far flung and (like Mr Yeltsin) under
threat of imminent extinction. <BR>
<BR>
Future historians will doubtless muse over why the millennium should have
chosen to celebrate itself (if that is the word) with this curious inversion
of natural order. An anti-humanist disgust with visceral man? Or the re-emergence
of that sanguine belief, long dead in the west, that humankind is (all evidence
to the contrary) perfectible? <BR>
<BR>
It is, at any rate, a cheerless process, as Mr Schrempp would doubtless
concur, and it may be more than that too. The point about drinking is that
it inspires not merely the writing of Keatsian odes but conviviality. Strapping
yourself to a Nautilus machine may make you a leaner executive but does
it make you a better one? A silhouette intended to emit the semiotic signal
&quot;efficient&quot; might, after all, equally well be translated as &quot;self-absorbed&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
Contrariwise, broken veins and a tendency to stagger suggest a commendable
capacity in their owner for loving one's fellow man (just ask any drunk).
With management gurus increasingly including the word &quot;nice&quot; in
their armoury, this quality may yet come to be recognised as more valuable
in a corporate warrior than the flatness of his tummy. If this seems unlikely,
then observe the growing ferocity with which the tigers of Tokyo and Taipei
now insist on their employees drinking sake and singing karaoke. You have
been warned. Let us raise a glass to Mr Schrempp. Or two. Or three.

<H2>WATER THE NEXT SOURCE OF TROUBLE </H2>
<H4>Daniel Butler on the clouds looming over access to a truly essential
commodity </H4>
&quot;Many of the wars this century were about oil, but those of the next
century will be over water.&quot; The announcement by Ismail Serageldin,
vice-president of the World Bank, made headlines across the western world
this summer, but it was old news to much of the globe. Chronic water shortages
affect 80 nations and 40% of the world's population. Demand for water is
increasing at more than 2% annually, which means it doubles every 21 years.
The crisis will get still worse. <BR>
<BR>
Not that there is any shortage of water as such: after all, two-thirds of
the globe is covered with the stuff. As American hydrologist Robert Ambroggi
confirms: &quot;The total quantity of water on earth exceeds all conceivable
needs of the human population.&quot; The problem is that it is not evenly
distributed and for many of the world's poorest countries, finding drinkable
water is a costly exercise. <BR>
<BR>
Not surprisingly, for many countries the security of water sources is already
one of the most important elements in foreign policy, far outstripping oil.
After all, alternative energies can always be found be they gas, coal or
nuclear, but without water life itself is impossible. To make matters worse,
it is a resource which respects no man-made borders. The rivers from which
most people get their water have a tendency to meander across frontiers.
<BR>
<BR>
Governments are acutely aware of the subject's potential for conflict. Defence
experts point to Egypt's disputes with Sudan over both politics and water
before noting Egypt's new jungle warfare unit; strange for a mainly desert
country with no forests. <BR>
<BR>
According to Peter Gleik of California's Pacific Institute for Studies in
Development, Environment and Security, almost half the world's population
lives in 250 river basins shared by several nations. For example, Botswana,
Bulgaria, Cambodia, the Congo, Gambia, Sudan and Syria all receive more
than three-quarters of their water from rivers which flow across borders
with potentially hostile neighbours. <BR>
<BR>
Exacerbating the crisis is the world's rapid population growth. Today there
are over 5 billion people on earth, but by 2025 there will be 8 billion
struggling for available water. Not surprisingly, as demand increases, so
do the pressures on supplies and thus the scope for conflicts. Indeed, according
to the former Israeli general Ariel Sharon, it has already played its part
in one major war. &quot;People generally regard June 5, 1967 as the day
the Six-Day War began,&quot; he replied to a journalist's question. &quot;That
is the official date, but in reality it started two-and-a-half years earlier
on the day Israel decided to act against the diversion of the Jordan.&quot;
Sharon, later to become a hawkish Likud defence minister, was referring
to the 1964 decision by neighbouring Arab states to re-route the waters
of the River Jordan. This was abandoned after Israel mounted long-range
bombing missions into Syria. <BR>
<BR>
Water continues to play a pivotal role in the region's politics and nowhere
is the potential for a water war greater than the Middle East. Indeed, it
is the weapon currently being used in Iraq by Saddam Hussein to cow the
rebellious Marsh Arabs. By constructing the 565km Third River canal in six
months following the Gulf War, Baghdad is draining marshes in the south
of the country, depriving inhabitants of their livelihoods and protection
from attack. <BR>
<BR>
The Jordan basin is probably the region's biggest source of dispute, however.
It is the main potential source of fresh water for four nations on its way
to the Dead Sea, although in practice it has been in Israeli hands since
the capture of the Golan Heights in 1967. This was reinforced when Israel
occupied southern Lebanon in 1978 and so won control of the river's source.
<BR>
<BR>
Today it remains pivotal to the politics of the region and is at the heart
of the underlying impasse in the Palestinian/Israeli peace deal, along with
the West Bank aquifers. These are the vast underground stores of water,
built up over centuries as rainwater trickles down through the soil to be
stored in minute gaps in the rock and soil. Every year Israel pumps 600
million cubic metres (m3) of water (a third of its needs) from what are
effectively giant geological sponges underneath the West Bank. Of this,
a fifth goes to the 1.4 million local Arabs (82 m3 per capita), while the
130,000 Jewish settlers get 30 million m3 (almost five times more per person).
<BR>
<BR>
The Yarkon-Taninim is the largest disputed aquifer with a capacity of some
500 million m3 . It flows west and north east from the West Bank mountain
ranges, and stretches from Tel Aviv in the west to the Arab village of Tulkarm
in the east. Since 1967 the Palestinians have been banned from tapping it
by digging new wells or renovating old ones, but with peace in the air they
now want their share. Israel baulks at the idea: &quot;If the Palestinians
drill new wells in Tulkarm, they take away water going to Tel Aviv, it's
as simple as that,&quot; says Yaacov Tsur, Israel's agriculture minister.
They prefer to point to the 150 million m3 of water which flows east in
other aquifers and is largely unexploited by the Palestinians, mainly because
it lies deep beneath hard bedrock. <BR>
<BR>
Overall, however, the Israelis concede the issue of water ownership is vital
for everyone. Their preferred solution is to consider resources in terms
of future needs rather than legal ownership: &quot;We are now negotiating
over the levels of water each side needs, not about water rights,&quot;
foreign minister Shimon Peres told Yasser Arafat in July. Indeed, so problematic
is the issue that the negotiators have postponed a final deal until the
very end of the peace process in 1997, in an attempt to make progress elsewhere
(see Prince, page 11). <BR>
<BR>
Likewise, the Lebanese are unhappy with what they see as the theft of their
water. Last year an official complaint was made to the UN about apparent
Israeli poaching of the Litani and Wazzani rivers in southern Lebanon. After
spotting what appeared to be construction work, they claimed Israel intended
to pipe off water for the arid region north of Galilee. Israel denies this
but adds that both rivers are underused and says the region's water supplies
should be put into a &quot;water bank&quot; to be shared according to needs.
It claims that currently all countries, apart from itself, have more than
enough water provided it is properly used. <BR>
<BR>
While the ownership of available resources may be hotly contested, there
is unanimity about the gravity of the long-term situation. According to
a recent report, by 2020 the water available to each Israeli will have fallen
by more than half but for Gaza the future is even bleaker: one estimate
suggests it will run totally dry by the year 2000. Likewise the Jordanians
have every reason to be worried: The country is already one of the driest
in the world and its supplies will have dropped by two-thirds within a generation.
Most of the country gets under 200mm of rain a year, less per head than
Saudi Arabia and far less than any Saharan state. Historically most of its
water came from the River Jordan, but this was lost in 1967. Instead the
Jordanians had to turn to damming desert rivers or <I>wadis</I> to trap
the limited water available there and tapping their own aquifers. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, both sources are finite. The largest aquifer feeds the Azraq
Oasis to the east of Amman, supplied by 20 million m3 of water trickling
underground from the Syrian Druz mountains annually. For the past 40 years
this has been tapped to supply the capital, and at present more than double
the amount fed by the oasis is being extracted: &quot;The current rate of
pumping is more than twice the safe yield,&quot; confirms Muhammed Shatanawi,
director of water and environment research at the University of Jordan.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Exhaustion of water underneath Jordan </B><BR>
<BR>
Economic problems resulting from this unsustainable mining are already apparent.
Until the '60s the oasis was the largest expanse of fresh water in the Middle
East, with 3,000 m3 an hour bubbling up to produce fertile grazing and water
for wandering Bedouins and their flocks. By 1992 the last spring dried up
totally. The same goes for the aquifer under Amman, albeit on a smaller
scale, and official estimates predict it will be exhausted in 25 years.
Indeed, some prophets of doom go further. When Germany's Friedrich Ebert
Institute assessed the problem in 1993 it concluded that even if distribution
and irrigation were made more efficient, Jordan's rapidly expanding population
of 4 million would exhaust available supplies by the turn of the century.
<BR>
<BR>
Not surprisingly, the results are already beginning to show: this year was
the fifth in a row that water rationing has been imposed on the capital
and the country only manages one crop a year, compared with Israel's three.
<BR>
<BR>
Naturally, the authorities are aware of the problem and have put forward
a range of solutions. King Hussein favours capital intensive measures, for
example. One solution is to tap the southern Disi aquifer which straddles
the border area with Saudi Arabia. This would yield 100 million m3 of water
a year, but would involve the construction of a 350km pipeline and cost
some $450 million. <BR>
<BR>
A simpler solution would be to dam the Yarmuk, which flows from Syria into
the Jordan. Although dry most of the year, it contributes to nearly half
of the country's surface water and could supply a large percentage of its
water needs. Until now hostilities made this impossible: Israeli troops
destroyed an early dam attempt during the Six-Day War. Recent peace talks
have changed all this, however, and Israel is keen to offer its expertise
in stretching water use to the limits as part of a deal. <BR>
<BR>
More grandiose still is the Red-Dead Canal, which would pipe sea water from
Aqaba on the Red Sea to the Dead Sea. Until recently, the latter lay 392
metres below sea level, its water loss through evaporation topped up by
the River Jordan. Thanks to exploitation of the latter, however, the water
level has dropped 17 metres and its surface has shrunk by a third. Experts
predict that if something drastic is not done soon, it will have vanished
entirely within the next half century. <BR>
<BR>
So the Jordanian king proposes a 240km pipeline, carrying 1,900 million
m3 of water annually, to raise the Dead Sea to its former level within a
decade. From then on it would carry 1,200 million m3 , so allowing the River
Jordan to be exploited fully by man. Because of the difference in height
between the the sea and the river, the pipeline could house a hydroelectric
power plant. Although two-thirds of the power generated would be needed
to pump the water over its first hurdle, a 220-metre climb north of Aqaba,
there would still be enough power left to desalinate 800 million m3 of sea
water. The drawback? Apart from uncertainty over the environmental effects
of pumping sea water into the already highly saline Dead Sea, the cost looks
prohibitive. The World Bank estimates that the project would take a decade
and cost between $3 billion and $4 billion: beyond the pocket of a country
devoid of oil and with few natural resources, with an average per capita
income of just $1,700 per year. <BR>
<BR>
Another volatile problem occurs to the north, along the Tigris and the Euphrates.
Both rivers have their sources in the mountains of Turkey, before meandering
across Syria and Iraq to the Gulf. Although Turkey allows a reasonable supply
into Syria under a 1987 protocol, supporting the latter's agriculture and
hydroelectric schemes, the Syrian government is still unsatisfied. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Dissatisfaction downstream </B><BR>
<BR>
Downstream, Iraq is also dissatisfied by its share of the flow, which has
shrunk to just over half of the volume leaving Turkey. Both nations' protests
have met with a frosty response in Ankara: &quot;Neither Syria nor Iraq
can lay claim to Turkey's rivers, any more than Ankara could claim their
oil,&quot; announced Turkey's President Suleyman Demirel after one such
protest. &quot;We have a right to do anything we like.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The president has a personal interest in the subject. He masterminded the
ambitious GAP programme of water schemes, including dams on the Tigris and
Euphrates rivers, hydroelectric plants and irrigation canals. In theory
around a fifth of Turkey's total cultivable terrain, or an area 10 times
the size of Belgium, could be brought into production. This would increase
agricultural production fourfold, generate over a fifth of its total hydroelectric
potential, create over 3 million jobs, increase per capita incomes fivefold
and create exports worth $6 billion a year. <BR>
<BR>
Since its inception in the '50s, Turkey has spent $11 billion on GAP and
has plans to pump twice that much again into the scheme. So far almost all
the money has come from Turkey itself; the World Bank fought shy of providing
funds because of the concerns felt downstream in Syria and Iraq. Some of
these fears appeared to be confirmed in 1989 with the opening of the Atat&uuml;rk
dam on the Euphrates: filling it stopped the river's flow entirely for a
month. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Water-for-Kurds deal </B><BR>
<BR>
There are glimmers of hope for the Iraqis and Syrians, however. Turkey has
many sources of water but has a problem with Kurdish separatists who flit
across borders. In return for help against the Kurds, Turkey's foreign minister
Ferhat Ataman has strongly hinted, future supplies could be increased. <BR>
<BR>
In the late '80s, Turkey's late president Turgut Ozal proposed a vast scheme
known as the &quot;peace pipeline&quot; to carry an annual 2,200 million
m3 of water to neighbours from its Seyhan and Ceyhan rivers. Although potential
customers are not keen to be dependant on foreign water, the idea caught
on in Ankara and prime minister Tansu &Ccedil;iller now wants to sell water
to Israel by piping it southwards from the Mediterranean port of Antalya.
<BR>
<BR>
Africa too has immense problems. According to Norman Myers, a fellow of
Green College, Oxford and consultant to the World Bank, within the next
decade Egypt's water supply per person will drop by a third, Nigeria's by
two-fifths, and Kenya's by half. The problem is especially acute in Africa
because people are cutting down water-saving forests as populations grow.
<BR>
<BR>
The Nile is unquestionably the biggest potential source of trouble. Egypt
in particular depends on the river for almost all its water and is understandably
sensitive about what happens upstream. In theory a 50-year-old treaty gives
Cairo a major say in use of Lake Victoria's waters and a 1959 deal allows
Egyptian experts to be based in Sudan. &quot;Egypt's annual per capita share
of water is below 1,000 cubic metres - that is to say below the poverty
line. It is expected to drop, as the population grows, to 600 by 2025,&quot;
announced Abdel-Hadi Radi, Egypt's minister of public works and water resources.
He is particularly worried about irrigation schemes planned further up the
Nile in Sudan and Ethiopia. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Transferring water beyond the Nile basin could have grave consequences.
Once established, such a precedent would give all parties a right to dispose
of the water as they wished... Any scheme involving Nile water must take
into consideration the aspirations and welfare of all Nile basin countries,&quot;
he says. He has cause to be concerned, for there are signs the accords are
breaking down. Earlier this year several Khartoum-based Egyptian officials
were arrested by the Sudanese authorities and their property confiscated.
This prompted a major diplomatic row and concern that a water dispute could
exacerbate tensions between the two nations, already running high thanks
to the fundamentalist leanings of Khartoum. <BR>
<BR>
In reality, however, agriculture lies behind most of the water problems
across the Arab world. Although Middle Eastern states share less than 1%
of world's water supplies, for political reasons most of them have a policy
of self-sufficiency in food. This explains why 90% of the water they use
annually goes on agriculture. In order to green the desert, these states
are tapping aquifers and exploiting them far faster than they can be replenished.
Saudi Arabia, for example, has 1,800 boreholes on the Wajid aquifer 700km
south-west of Riyadh. Each irrigates eight hectares, enough to fill 10 good-sized
swimming pools. As a result the Saudis, who until a decade ago imported
half their food, are now self-sufficient in food and exporting 2 million
tonnes of wheat a year. Meanwhile the aquifer is falling by 10 metres a
year and extraction is calculated as 100 times the sustainable level. <BR>
<BR>
Likewise, although only a fraction of Jordan is under cultivation, agriculture
is responsible for the waste of vast amounts of water. In the Azraq basin,
for example, millions of cubic metres are lost through leaking pipes and
inefficient distribution systems such as spray irrigation, which wastes
far more than trickle systems. This represents about a third of the total
supplies available. Underlying this waste is the low cost of water, a fraction
of the prices charged to the relatively water-wealthy Israelis. For example,
Jordanian farmers pay nothing towards capital projects and support only
half of the operating costs. Thus there is no incentive to conserve water
and little interest in irrigating fields with semi-treated sewage, known
as brown water, as in Israel. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The threat of thirsty tourism </B><BR>
<BR>
The impending crisis has further worrying implications for long-term development
in the region. Since peace was first announced in 1993, for example, many
oil-poor countries have begun to look to tourism as a future source of revenue,
talking grandiosely of the &quot;heritage tourism trail&quot; which would
take high-spending western visitors across borders to visit the historic
sights of the Holy Land. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, tourism is the most water-intensive industry of all. According
to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, the same amount of water
needed to irrigate one hectare of high-yielding rice can support 100 urban
families for two years, or keep 100 luxury hotel guests going for just 55
days. <BR>
<BR>
Water problems can be found around the globe. Until the '60s, for example,
the Aral Sea in formerly Soviet central Asia was the world's fourth largest
store of fresh water and supported a thriving fishing industry. In 1958,
however, Soviet scientists began to divert water flowing into the Sea to
produce rice and cotton in the naturally barren Turkmenistan. The result
has been one of the world's greatest ecological disasters: by 1993 the Aral
had lost three-quarters of its water and had been transformed into three
highly saline lakes, killing virtually all sea life. Ports such as Muynak
in Uzbekistan, which used to support a fishing industry employing thousands
of people, are now separated from what is left of the Aral by up to 145km
of desert. Worse, pollution from heavy metals and pesticides, formerly trapped
in the sea mud, is now whipped up by the desert winds. As a result a recent
survey showed three-quarters of the town to be suffering from different
cancers. <BR>
<BR>
Not surprisingly, tempers are running high. Moscow &quot;demanded 6 million
tonnes of cotton from us and the entire socialist camp lived off that cotton,&quot;
announced Islam Karimov, president of newly independent Uzbekistan, at a
recent conference on the problem. &quot;They put pressure on [us] to...
feed Cuba, Korea and the whole socialist camp with cotton. It was this barbaric
use of water which led to the Aral tragedy.&quot; He is now demanding that
Russia, centre of the former Soviet empire, make a major contribution in
money and expertise to solving the problem. <BR>
<BR>
The dry regions of Asia and Africa do not have a monopoly in water disputes.
In Europe, for example, Hungary and Slovakia are embroiled in a row over
the latter's damming of the Danube at Gabcikovo-Nagymaros as part of a combined
irrigation and hydroelectric scheme. Hungary is incensed and has appealed
to the International Court of Justice. <BR>
<BR>
Not even the wealthy US is immune. The farms of the mid-west, wrested from
the buffalo and Indians a century ago, are drying up thanks to unsustainable
tapping of aquifers. In Kansas alone, more than 1,127km of formerly perennial
streams have run dry permanently. This is due to unrestrained tapping of
the main aquifer, the Ogallala, whose level is falling at the rate of 17
metres a year. This is also reflected in wells to the west of the state,
where water levels have declined by two-thirds since 1940. The culprit,
yet again, is agriculture: Plains farmers use a third of all US water, mainly
to produce subsidised crops. There must be doubts over the future, however,
as the cost of extraction rises rapidly and already many are going out of
business. Indeed, some agricultural scientists are now recommending that
the Plains be returned to the buffalo in the form of ranches before the
little remaining water runs out. <BR>
<BR>
In California, the struggle to find water goes one step further, with two
conflicting interests squabbling over supplies. In a state where rainfall
is a paltry 355mm<B> </B>a year, water-based disputes between farmers and
Los Angeles are a longstanding problem - remember Jack Nicholson in
the film <I>Chinatown</I>. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Water fights in California </B><BR>
<BR>
Under a Federal Law of 1902, farms of under 400 hectares are guaranteed
cheap water. As Los Angeles' need for water continues to grow, however,
there are rumblings from urban-based politicians and now the Clinton administration
is proposing to change the law, which could mean prices rising as much as
five times. Not for first time, the powerful farming lobby is up in arms.
<BR>
<BR>
The World Bank believes one solution for the general problem lies in valuing
water as an economic resource. Proper pricing would do much, it says, to
reduce waste and focus minds. While this may have a part to play, it is
also highly controversial. For a start it ignores the spiritual and cultural
values which many religions put on water. Ignoring the obvious example of
a river such as the Ganges in India, even nominally secular rivers can have
great political significance. Egypt's president Anwar Sadat experienced
this shortly after the Camp David Accord, when he proposed piping a small
portion of the Nile up to the Negev desert in Israel, possibly extending
the scheme to Lebanon, Syria or Jordan. The Nile is rich with symbolism
to many Egyptians, however, and the dream was rapidly abandoned when it
prompted an army assassination plot. <BR>
<BR>
Likewise, the prospect of realistic water prices upsets many liberals, who
regard access to water as a basic human right. Nor are such beliefs confined
to the political left: &quot;Our target must be for all citizens to be able
to afford, without government subsidies... water and waste services,&quot;
says Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan. &quot;These are essential components
of the basic right to a decent standard of life.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In addition to water pricing, the World Bank calls for heavy investment.
Although this does not come cheap, it says even small projects are worthwhile.
For example, a 10-week cholera outbreak in Peru earlier this year is believed
to have cost the equivalent of three times the amount invested in water
projects in the country over the last decade. <BR>
<BR>
For many countries, however, the level of expenditure required to tackle
the problem is overwhelming. For a start, the most suitable sites for dams
in those countries crying out for water have usually already been exploited.
As a result, hydrologists and civil engineers are forced to turn to more
complicated or grandiose schemes, which are expensive. The World Bank itself
calculates that the $36 billion invested over the past 45 years will have
to be doubled over next decade to keep pace with demand, and even then it
would be unlikely to satisfy demand in some of the more desperate cases.
They tend to have high human costs too: over the past few years 16 million
people have lost homes to reservoirs in India alone, while a further million
will have to move to make way for the Three Gorges scheme on the Yangtze.
<BR>
<BR>
In fact, most experts advise thrift over grandiose schemes. In Jordan, for
example, in spite of the desperate need for water the approach to existing,
dwindling stocks is lax. Official figures say over half of the water which
goes into Amman's supply system is unaccounted for: leaks are thought to
account for half these losses. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Water everywhere, but not to drink </B><BR>
<BR>
Indeed, in spite of its call for investment worth $600 billion over the
next decade, equivalent to a quarter of its loan budget, even the Bank concedes
that controlling demand will prove far more cost-effective than the grandiose
capital-intensive schemes loved by politicians. Desalination works, for
example, are popular in oil-rich Gulf states but are expensive and demand
large amounts of energy. For Saudi Arabia, with a quarter of the world's
proven oil supplies, this may be no problem but for poor states like Jordan
or Syria it is not an option. <BR>
<BR>
The one possible exception is the Red-Dead canal scheme. Although even its
proponents agree that it is too costly for farming, it could be exactly
what the region needs. It would force realistic pricing, which in turn would
force everyone to adopt more responsible conservation methods. <BR>
<BR>
More importantly, however, it would tie Israel and Jordan into a huge shared
project. With the pipeline threading across both sides of the border, its
very vulnerability would be a powerful force for continuing cooperation.
In a world of dwindling water supplies, that can only be a good thing.
<H4>TALES FROM THE RIVERBANKS</H4>
Mekong A growing rate of industrialisation means rows have increased tension
between Laos, Vietnam and Thailand. <BR>
<BR>
Bramaputra Deforestation in Nepal and Bangladesh is causing a build-up of
silt in the Bay of Bengal. This is creating an island which both India and
Bangladesh are intent on claiming as their own. <BR>
<BR>
Ganges 300 million Indian farmers depend on the river, but tree-felling
in the Himalayan foothills is disrupting the flow and causing increasingly
serious floods in Bangladesh. <BR>
<BR>
Indus Pakistan is dependent on the river, two of whose main tributaries
are used by India to water the Punjab grain basket. <BR>
<BR>
Jordan Arguably the world's most valued and disputed river, it rises in
the Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon and the nominally Syrian Golan Heights.
From here it flows south to the Dead Sea, via Jordan and the occupied West
Bank. On its way, Israel taps 83% of available water. Its use is strongly
disputed by Jordanians, Palestinians and Israelis. Although peace negotiators
have postponed a deal on eventual ownership until 1997, this is likely to
be an intractable problem. <BR>
<BR>
Tigris/Euphrates Rising in Turkey, these two rivers flow south east through
Syria and Iraq, a fertile crescent known as the cradle of civilisation where
it is thought pre-historic man first turned to agriculture. Turkey's recent
grandiose gap-irrigation and hydroelectric schemes have diverted much of
the rivers' volume, generating deep concern in Syria and Iraq. Comparatively
water-rich Turkey seems prepared to compromise on the issue in return for
its neighbours' help with Kurdish rebels. <BR>
<BR>
Nile Flows through 10 countries. Provides almost all of Egypt's water. Egypt
and Sudan have an agreement over use of the river but water projects upstream
in Sudan, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire could threaten
Egypt's survival. <BR>
<BR>
Kufrah aquifer Libya's great man-made river, which exploits the southern
Kufrah aquifer for use in the arid north, is causing alarm in Cairo. The
Egyptians fear that as the water table drops, the Nile could leak westwards,
either through subterranean aquifers or overland. In this case Egypt has
military contingency plans to seize a portion of southern Libya and stop
the leaks. <BR>
<BR>
Zambeze Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa are all heavily reliant on the
river and squabbles are already beginning. <BR>
<BR>
Danube Slovakia's combined irrigation and hydroelectric scheme at Gabcikovo
on the Danube has incensed Hungary and caused concern in other countries
downstream on one of Europe's greatest rivers. Hungary has appealed to the
International Court of Justice. <BR>
<BR>
Rio Grande The slightest hint of a dry spell provokes tension between US
and Mexican farmers over the water flow in this, the major source of water
for most of the arid southern American states and for much of northern Mexico.

<H4>Although it did not come into existence as a political entity until
the early '70s, the French Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes region has become famous trading
on existing traditions of commercial savvy and simple industriousness. Despite
unemployment and recent high-profile scandals, the success of smaller companies
and the positive business climate are succeeding in attracting a range of
foreign investors <BR>

The strength of industries based on know-how and added value helps insultate
exports from le franc fort <BR>
<BR>
<I>By Andrew Rosenbaum </I><BR>
<BR>
What makes a region? In 1972 the French president of the day, Georges Pompidou,
sliced the country up into new pieces, an act viewed at the time as a great
piece of administrative daring. Since then, the name Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes has
entered everyday use but as local people admit themselves, it has not always
been easy to figure out what makes someone Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpine. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The eight <I>d&eacute;partements</I> of the Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes do not
have the unifying history and culture of a territory like the Limousin,&quot;
admits Mark Varlet, MD of the Chambre Regionale de Commerce et d'Industrie
Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes. &quot;We have a piece of Provence, a bit of Burgundy,
the Savoie - which was Italian only a little over a century ago - and the
west, which is really part of the Massif Centrale. At first glance, there
is not much pulling our 5.5 million people together.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Of course, it is not that simple. &quot;There are a few characteristics
which many of us have in common,&quot; Varlet continues. &quot;One thing
you find throughout the Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes are people with business skills,
a certain know-how. They like to form family businesses for which they are
very good at finding specialised markets. Then, they like to work hard and
enjoy the finer aspects of our natural surroundings when they are not working.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Know-how but no heavy industry </B><BR>
<BR>
This is, indeed the character on which the Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpine economy is
based. By some great coincidence (some say design) no area in the region
has the heavy industry that one finds in Germany's Ruhr valley or in the
lowlands of Scotland. As Christian Bossuges, assistant director of the Lyon
Regional Office of the Banque de France, points out: &quot;Instead, technical
activities that involve a considerable level of know-how were worked out
by local businessmen.&quot; The savvy, local entrepreneur can be found from
the Alps to Provence; there are about 150,000 companies in the region and
75% of them employ fewer them 10 people, according to the Chambre Regionale
de Commerce. <BR>
<BR>
Just how savvy is this Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpine? Well, he is better at exporting
what he makes than entrepreneurs in most of the other French regions. The
FFr138.63 billion [$47.9 billion] in products he sells to other countries
beats all the others except the Paris region. The Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpine tends
to deal in goods with a high value-added content so that his export sales
have not been hurt by the highly valued franc. To give an idea of the influence
of large industry, consider the chemicals industry in Lyon which employs
32,000 people; 10 times as many depend on it for their livelihood). <BR>
<BR>
Exports are helped by the fact that the Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes region has one
of the best-developed transport infrastructures in France including the
high speed TGV train from Paris and beyond. A planned extension of the service
to Turin will make exporting even easier. &quot;Good communications give
an advantage to the many dynamic companies found there,&quot; enthuses Bernard
Weymuller, vice-president for corporate banking in France and Belgium at
Chase Manhattan. <BR>
<BR>
Apart from exports, production is also key: the region accounts for about
10% of total French GNP and claims to produce more than 10% in areas such
as electronics or mechanical engineering. The downside is that those sectors
which depend on subcontracting can suffer along with the industries they
depend on, although residents say they are broadening their client base.
For example the Vall&eacute;e de l'Arve, near Geneva, is almost completely
dependent on Renault Industrial Vehicles for which it carries out a specialised
metal preparation. When Renault does well, as now, the valley prospers.
When it does not, clouds loom. <BR>
<BR>
In general, however, Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpine businesses have chosen their field
carefully. Lyon houses a cluster of specialised chemicals, pharmaceuticals,
biotechnology and nuclear energy - France is one of the world leaders in
this field and the region is home to the recently re-started Superph&eacute;nix
reactor. Closer to Grenoble, the emphasis shifts to computers and electronics,
plastics, new materials or scientific research. Up in the mountains the
ski industry predominates; Chamonix and the Val d'Is&egrave;re are considerable
attractions for tourists. There is still plenty of subcontracting in metallurgy
and mechanical engineering throughout the region, and farming takes up a
noticeable percentage of total activity. Textiles continue to play a minor
role. Services are of increasing importance. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fallout from fall of textiles </B><BR>
<BR>
Despite the phenomenon of the Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpine entrepreneur, there is
still excessive unemployment in the region. &quot;Many unemployed people
were part of formerly flourishing industries, like textiles,&quot; explains
Philippe Albert, vice-president of the Lyon business school &Eacute;cole
Superieure de Commerce. &quot;Others have not yet been able to make the
necessary switch from a traditional family trade to something else.&quot;
The current unemployment rate for the region is 11.5%, some 5% lower than
the French total. But it is shedding jobs at a rate slightly faster than
the French average, economists here say. <BR>
<BR>
The area has been suffering lately from other problems. A series of nasty
and highly publicised political scandals have been rocking city halls. The
mayor of Grenoble has been under investigation for corruption and Lyon's
deputy-mayor Michel Noir, an extremely popular local conservative politician,
was charged with accepting gifts from local businessman Michel Botton two
years ago. Botton's companies allegedly helped Noir lead the high life and
although it has never been established that Botton received anything in
return, relations between the two were just too close for the judges to
accept. Noir has been barred from local politics and the city is trying
to live the scandal down. <BR>
<BR>
The Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpine entrepreneur does not always succeed but when he
does, he seems to be able to make good use of the region's special characteristics,
its numerous small industry and its good work ethic. Philippe Foriel-Destezet
provides a perfect example. <BR>
<BR>
In 1964 he was working as a commercial director in a Lyonnais machine shop
when he decided to make a change and founded a temporary employment agency
in the outskirts of Lyon. Two big British and US agencies already had offices
in town, but Foriel-Destezet had ideas of his own. He installed his agencies
in cheaper, outlying areas where smaller industries actually had their workshops.
The strategy of keeping close to the customer worked, and in a few years
Foriel-Destezet's Ecco went on to apply his strategy in France and around
the world. Ecco is now the second-biggest temporary employment agency in
the world, grossing about FFr20 billion a year. Not surprisingly, Foriel-Destezet
is a believer in the region and maintains the European headquarters of his
company at Lyon. <BR>
<BR>
<B>flow of foreign investors </B><BR>
<BR>
Foreign investors have not been slow to take advantage of the region's dynamic
entrepreneurs: Hewlett-Packard, for example, has located its headquarters
at the Isle d'Abeau near Lyon. While statistics are not availiable on the
exact amount of regional foreign direct investment (FDI), according to Robert
Maury, director of the Association pour le developpement &eacute;conomique
de la region lyonnaise, it attracts several hundred million dollars every
year. &quot;Foreigners are attracted by the low cost of services in the
region,&quot; Maury says. &quot;Electricity is cheaper here than anywhere
else in Europe; water is cheap too and we've got plenty. If you compare
us with northern Europe, we are well ahead.&quot; Albert of the business
school adds: &quot;Being in the Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes puts them right at the
centre of Europe.&quot; While this may well be exaggerated, it is certainly
possible to travel easily to almost anywhere on the continent. <BR>
<BR>
Most investment in the Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes comes from the EU, according to
the association: European investment is behind 278 establishments in the
region. The US follows with 118, non-EU European investment accounts for
56 and Japan is responsible for 10. In terms of employee numbers, however,
the US is the largest investor, creating about 27,000 jobs. The mechanical
and electrical equipment sectors attract the most foreign investment, followed
by metals and chemicals, and services are attracting increasing interest,
Maury says. Weymuller at Chase Manhattan agrees that this is where future
job growth is likely to come: &quot;Pharmaceuticals and electronics are
among the areas expected to see the most foreign investment in the years
to come.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
According to Maury, 15 years ago the Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes ranked about 11th
in France for FDI: now it is at least third and possibly second. Last year
International Pepper invested $50 million in a liquid packaging unit for
Europe; the Japanese auto equipment maker Koyosueko also put in a considerable
sum for a plant and Ikea built a logistics centre nearby. &quot;This investment
has direct consequences,&quot; Maury says. &quot;We create about 1,000 jobs
every year.&quot; The Franco-Italian joint venture in microelectronics,
SGS-Thomson, is not exactly foreign but did not hesitate. It chose to build
one of its most important semiconductor plants at Crolles just 15km outside
Grenoble at the end of 1993, an investment of $600 million. The city was
chosen because Grenoble is already one of the most important centres of
scientific and technical research in France, with a ready supply of specially
trained personnel. <BR>
<BR>
One sector that foreign investors in Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes have favoured little
in the past is that of tourism. This is surprising since Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes
is France's second-most important tourist destination and one of the area's
most important industries, bringing in close to FFr14.7 billion per year,
according to Vincent Rains, director of the region's tourism committee.
&quot;We are pedalling a myth here,&quot; Rains insists. Chamonix and the
Val d'Is&egrave;re are among the most famous ski destinations in the world
and the committee is spending considerable sums to promote its resorts in
the US and Japan. &quot;We are hoping to attract more of these tourists
since their individual spending is higher than that of Europeans,&quot;
Rains explains. <BR>
<BR>
Another activity the region is hoping to develop is rural tourism. An increasingly
popular formula in France involves taking the family to spend a week on
the farm. Rains hopes that this will become ever more popular, because it
helps the region fight against the so-called <I>desertification </I>- complete
abandonment - of small rural towns. <BR>
<BR>
As one would expect of such a lively region, Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes has ambitions
including a bid to host the summer Olympic games in 2004. &quot;We will
be seeing some tough competition including Capetown and several American
cities but we can offer the most agreeable surroundings,&quot; says Michel
Rivoire, advisor to the president of the Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes regional council.
&quot;Few regions enjoy such a high and continuing level of cultural activity.&quot;
Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes is also famous for its good food, so Rivoire's claim may
not be overdone. <BR>
<BR>
A preliminary study shows that the cost of holding the games should not
place an excessive burden on the local authorities, he adds. But why has
the region decided to take on the task now? The cities are already working
together, Rivoire says, &quot;but if we win the Olympic games, we will see
a huge cooperative effort from the whole region. That is just what we want
to encourage.&quot; <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>
<H3><A NAME="chemical-solution"></A>CHEMICAL SOLUTION </H3>
<B>The region's traditional base in chemistry gives Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes a
competitive edge over other areas </B><BR>
<BR>
The Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes region has a long history of involvement with chemicals.
As a medical centre since the Middle Ages, Lyon has always had scientific
schools, and until the beginning of this century the silk trade called for
chemists to mix dyes and provide new fabrics. The people of Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes
have been building on their chemical knowledge ever since. &quot;It's one
of our most valued skills: if you need to build a new molecule, come to
Lyon,&quot; says Xavier Patrouillard, regional manager of Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes'
largest industrial company Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc. <BR>
<BR>
The figures are impressive. With sales of about FFr50 billion [$10 billion]
a year, the chemical industry is one of the largest sectors in the region,
contributing close to 25% of the region's total sales of manufactured goods.
What makes it such a hotbed of chemical research is the even balance between
traditional chemistry and detailed, cutting-edge areas like parachemistry
and pharmaceuticals. This gives it an advantage over competing centres such
as Paris, where traditional chemicals outweigh the more specialised fields.
<BR>
<BR>
The area's tradition as a crucible for both chemistry and research has produced
a vast quantity of small, flexible businesses. &quot;These companies often
have considerable need for financing new projects,&quot; comments Christian
Bossuges, assistant director of the Lyon office of the Banque de France.
&quot;I hope the region will work out a way to aid financing them.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
But financing start-ups is only one part of the problem. It is as important
for these companies that a whole slew of consulting experts work locally,
largely in the area between Lyon and Grenoble. These boffins maintain centres
for r&amp;d, which stay in regular contact with public and private scientific
laboratories and speed up the pace of innovation in the region. <BR>
<BR>
A crisis has dogged the industry for the past three years. Although Patrouillard
says that Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc has weathered the storm, the company is still
not hiring in Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes. &quot;We have spent the past few years
seeking to gain productivity,&quot; he says, &quot;so we are hoping to enjoy
the fruits of that effort now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Last year Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc spent FFr500 million in the region developing
an effective cure for animal parasites like fleas and ticks. A much greater
sum is being put into the development of silicone products. Other projects
under way include the development of tyres which save energy in use. The
company is particularly looking for growth in pharmaceuticals and speciality
chemicals, as part of a group-wide strategy to reorient away from base chemicals.
<BR>
<BR>
With two rivers to supply the large quantity of water required for chemical
processing, Lyon is well-suited to the industry. But environmentally, chemical
companies have a poor public image and much of Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc's recent
investment has gone towards tackling this. &quot;People still say that we're
polluting the rivers and leave bad smells,&quot; complains Patrouillard.
&quot;As a result the entire Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpine chemicals industry has made
a formal commitment to see that nothing of that sort occurs anymore.&quot;
For the time being, industry is cleaning itself up but in time, Patrouillard
says, the company will invest once more in the production side of its activities
in the region.<BR><BR> <HR WIDTH=60%>
<H3><A NAME="premier-barre"></A>COINS FOR STACKING </H3>
<B>Lyon mayor Raymond Barre, a man used to standing on the world stage,
is bullish about prospects for his city <BR>
<BR>
</B><I>By Andrew Rosenbaum </I><BR>
<BR>
Lyon mayor and former French prime minister Raymond Barre is the grand old
man of both local and national French politics. As someone used to strutting
on the international stage he can look at the smaller picture and say with
pride: &quot;Our regional unity is in the process of being forged.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Barre is a man who has spent much of his career as a cabinet minister and
parliamentarian in Paris, but in the 19th century gilt salon of the Lyon
H&ocirc;tel de Ville he is uninhibited in his enthusiasm when he talks about
his home turf. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The eight <I>d&eacute;partements </I>included in Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes
share... common interests, especially in the reinforcement of our network
of cities which are beginning to work together. Their companies already
have many joint projects,&quot; he explains. I recently met with the mayor
of Grenoble to work out a variety of projects that involved the two cities'
universities. This kind of cooperation is proving extremely fruitful and
it's happening more and more often.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Cooperation is fruitful, Barre says, because the people of Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes
are natural entrepreneurs. &quot;That's the one common culture that underlies
all of the different histories that make up the region. They have always
faced tough competition and they have had to make it much on their own.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Province without provincialism </B><BR>
<BR>
Entrepreneurialism is coupled with a shrewd and thrifty nature. &quot;When
I had just been elected deputy, I saw a <I>guignol</I>, a puppet show, in
which a Lyonnais husband was criticising his wife,&quot; he adds. &quot;He
said, 'Look, coins are milled round but that's not for rolling, that's for
stacking'.&quot; These characteristics will attract the foreign investor.
&quot;That, and the favourable reception which foreign industry gets. There
is no provincialism here. Look at the way [US computer company] Hewlett-Packard
settled into our Isle d'Abeau,&quot; Barre says. <BR>
<BR>
There is a downside to internationalisation and Barre admits that some of
the region's industries have been buffeted. &quot;Our textile industry has
undergone a profound restructuring over the past 20 years,&quot; he says.
&quot;Now it is becoming competitive again.&quot; As an example, he points
to the creation of the remarkably successful Premiere Vision textile show
in Paris, produced by Lyonnais entrepreneurs. <BR>
<BR>
Local industriousness is best portrayed by the plethora of subcontractors
in the region who supply large industry, Barre says: &quot;The quality of
the work here is absolutely first-rate, especially in the areas of advanced
electronics, chemistry, energy and the health industries. There is an enormous
wealth of industrial <I>savoir faire</I>. [The area] is a kind of greenhouse
for young enterprises because the level of local business culture and skills
is so high.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Barre continues that the region's geographical position makes it a &quot;bridge
between north and south.&quot; Much of the region's development is intended
to extend this function with considerable investment in infrastructure.
&quot;Then there's plenty of space left to build even in our fairly densely
populated region. There is room to grow,&quot; he adds. Barre is not interested
in seeing the national government use up that room. &quot;What we don't
want is the installation of some state industry.&quot; This would take up
space without providing benefits, as much of the labour force would come
from elsewhere. <BR>
<BR>
The region is growing, he insists, although the figures may not show it:
&quot;We are tied to national trends here in Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes and overall
growth prospects for France are not spectacular for the coming year.&quot;
But Barre remains indomitable and exhibits a bit of regional patriotism:
&quot;Of course, Rh&ocirc;ne-Alpes will keep up with the rest of the country
- and it will probably do several percentage points better.&quot; <p>

<H2>SANTA CATARINA</H2>
<H4>A balmy, unpolluted state in southern Brazil, Santa Catarina is keen
to take advantage of its central position in the new Mercosur South American
trade grouping to get a share of the action and open up to the world's investors
and tourists. While it waits for key tax and constitutional reforms to be
passed by the central government in Bras&iacute;lia, it has work to do on
its own services and infrastructure <BR>

<H3><A NAME="crest-wave"></A>ON THE CREST OF A WAVE </H3>
<B>A state bracing for welcome change as Mercosur pushes Brazil's centre
of economic gravity southwards <BR>
<BR>
</B><I>By Noll Scott </I><BR>
<BR>
Like a surfer eyeing the next wave powering in from the ocean, the Brazilian
state of Santa Catarina is in an expectant condition. After the lost decade
of the '80s, the state's tidal defences against foreign investment and competition
are coming down in anticipation of the coming crest. But there are fears
that Santa Catarina's more experienced competitors, like S&atilde;o Paulo,
may elbow it aside just as the big one breaks. <BR>
<BR>
Such metaphors come readily to mind in Santa Catarina, whose splendid Atlantic
coastline is an established mecca for surfers from around the world. The
seaside attractions also bring millions of tourists each year from Brazil,
Uruguay, Paraguay, and above all Argentina. <BR>
<BR>
<B>A penchant for lederhosen </B><BR>
<BR>
Yet to most of the outside world, Santa Catarina is known as just another
state in the Brazilian south, an agricultural backwater servicing one of
the world's biggest industrial heartlands a few hundred kilometres to the
north. More quaintly, the state is famous as the home of isolated German
immigrant communities, some of whom even today speak their language of origin
and wear <I>Lederhosen</I> during festivals. <BR>
<BR>
In a big federation like Brazil with 14 states, it is easy for member states
to fade into relative anonymity. Santa Catarina has an output double that
of nearby Uruguay, it has no separate entry in the reference books. Even
within Brazil itself, individual states have not always been able to shout
loud enough for their interests to be heeded, especially when they lie outside
the traditional centres of power. The people of Santa Catarina are used
to getting by on their own. <BR>
<BR>
Now, however, that picture is changing. The integration of Brazil, Uruguay,
Argentina and Paraguay within the south American common market Mercosur
is shifting the regional centre of economic gravity southwards. It is a
process which many believe could transform Santa Catarina - less than an
hour by air from Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Asunci&oacute;n, S&atilde;o Paulo
and Rio - from a peripheral player to the epicentre of regional development.
<BR>
<BR>
Complementing its newfound geographical good fortune, Santa Catarina has
a strong exporting tradition which places it in a good position to seize
on the new sales opportunities. Exports to the Mercosur countries grew from
$52 million to $288.5 million between 1990 and 1994 alone. This year, despite
unfavourable exchange rates which left Brazil's overall trading balance
in deficit, Santa Catarina's export expansion to Mercosur shows every sign
of continuing with a further 14% leap in the first half of this year compared
to the same period last year. <BR>
<BR>
But the state's entrepreneurs and administrators know there are limits to
expanding sales on the back of existing installations - Santa Catarina's
industries are already running at 83% of capacity, the highest for any Brazilian
state. They are now eager to lure new investment, preferably from abroad.
&quot;The stage in which Santa Catarina was establishing itself as a state
which specialised in supplying goods and services can be considered at an
end,&quot; says Pedro Sirotsky, vice-president of the Rede Brasil Sul broadcasting
and publishing empire which dominates the states of Santa Catarina, Paran&aacute;
and Rio Grande do Sul. &quot;We need to attract companies from outside,
to take advantage of our open spaces, our qualified labour force and our
internal market.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Here lies the crux of the issue. While Santa Catarina does have some impressive
credentials to offer would-be foreign investors, as well as generous tax
incentives to help them make up their minds, so far the state has yet to
sign up a single big-name foreign company. <BR>
<BR>
Apart from a central position within Mercosur, what are these credentials?
&quot;We have everything an entrepreneur could desire,&quot; answers state
governor Paulo Afonso Vieira, at 38 the youngest governor in the union.
&quot;Quality of life, infrastructure and a population which is disposed
to do everything to achieve a better future.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The first and third of these claims is beyond dispute. The state's education
system is highly rated and its workforce among the most productive in the
country. Santa Catarina also enjoys a benevolent sub-tropical climate, a
beautiful coastline and an agricultural interior of variety and immense
fertility. Its towns and villages, kempt and prosperous, are strongly reminiscent
of a rural Europe to which the overwhelming majority of the state's inhabitants
can trace their origins, earning the state the nickname Brazil's Europe.
Like its southern neighbours, Santa Catarina's public services are efficient.
The jewel in the crown is the capital Florian&oacute;polis, which stands
on an idyllic island unspoiled by industry. To sit 10 minutes' drive from
the city centre by a lagoon, eating fresh seafood and drinking in the view,
is a privilege no visitor should be allowed to miss. <BR>
<BR>
Santa Catarina's population is the most evenly spread in Brazil, an advantage
in an age when high technology demands decentralisation None of the state's
industrial and economic centres has more than 500,000 people, offering endless
possibilities for expansion. Only eight of the state's cities are larger
than 100,000 people. In striking contrast to the choking urban sprawls of
S&atilde;o Paulo and Rio, this decentralisation reinforces a lifestyle that
other Brazilians envy. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Infrastructure needs </B><BR>
<BR>
Vieira's second claim, about his state's infrastructure, is more questionable.
Following recent enabling legislation by the government in Bras&iacute;lia,
the state's major utilities - power, sewage and telecommunications - are
eagerly seeking private sector partnerships to help improve services The
state power company Celesc estimates it will need to invest $1 billion over
the next five years to meet demand which is growing at 5.5% a year. Celesc
plans to raise at least $400 million through a bond issue on the New York
stock exchange in the near future. <BR>
<BR>
In the transport sector, Santa Catarina's three ports are likely to move
towards privatisation in the next couple of years. Under the control of
the local municipal authority one of them, Itaja&iacute;, has invested in
handling machinery, cut costs and improved services. It has a lively partnership
with a number of major customers including the food processing and soya
bean giant Ceval, which is now financing the construction of its own berths
at the harbour. <BR>
<BR>
Glauco Jose Corta is executive vice-president of Santa Catarina's second
largest company Portobello, which produces ceramics, floor tiles and sugar:
he is among those who believe much more needs to be done to improve the
state's infrastructure including the road and rail network. &quot;This is
the critical element in making our industries competitive,&quot; he says.
&quot;As long as it costs four times as much to make an international telephone
call from Brazil to Europe as from Europe to Brazil, we are always going
to be at a disadvantage.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Costly delay in reform </B><BR>
<BR>
What of the future? Osvaldo Moreira Douat, president of the Santa Catarina
State Federation of Industry (ESC) believes foreign investors will wait
for the country's constitutional changes to complete their slow passage
to the statute books before they take advantage of the new opportunities.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Half a million jobs are being lost through the country's slowness
in passing the reforms,&quot; Douat estimates. Brazil's share of world trade
has slipped to 0.8% from 1.4% in 1985, with total volume now in excess of
$4 trillion, suggesting that &quot;there is a potential for expansion of
$24 billion a year&quot;. Santa Catarina's share of the jackpot would be
an increase of $1.3 billion. Douat, who joined Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso on a recent state visit to Germany and accompanied Vieira
to France, returned convinced that European business is now willing to invest
in Latin America, especially Brazil. He reckons that the emphasis has shifted
away from wholly owned subsidiaries towards joint ventures. <BR>
<BR>
The long-awaited administrative, taxation and state welfare reforms are
expected to be passed by congress next summer. For Vieira, this cannot come
soon enough if they clarify the muddled financial relationship between Brazil's
federal administration and the individual state administrations. &quot;We
need to make the taxpayer's life easier,&quot; he says, arguing for income
taxes to be levied at federal level, consumption taxes at state level and
property taxes at the local or municipal level. But he is alarmed by signs
that the central government may take over taxes on goods and services, until
now the regional state's main source of income. <BR>
<BR>
Vieira, a member of the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, was
elected in October 1994 with the backing of a coalition of parties including
the federal president's Brazilian Social Democratic Party and the right-wing
Liberal Front Party, the core of the alliance which also dominates the national
parliament. Like President Cardoso at national level, he has had to work
hard to win backing in the state legislature where his supporters do not
enjoy an automatic majority. Of the 22 proposals he sent for approval in
the first six months of his mandate, only 14 were passed without delay.
<BR>
<BR>
In the medium-term the state's prospects depend heavily on the <I>Plan Real</I>,
the government's stabilisation programme, introduced in the middle of last
year. While slashing inflation from 50% 18 months ago to around 1% a month,
the <I>Plan Real </I>has seen interest rates rise to record levels. At the
same time a high exchange rate has hit exports and a dramatic relaxation
of Brazil's former restrictions has unleashed a flood of cheaper imports,
wreaking havoc in a wide number of sectors including textiles, ceramics,
shoes and agriculture. <BR>
<BR>
Although Douat is one of many urging the central government to bring down
interest and exchange rates, he feels the stability achieved so far outweighs
the &quot;negative factors&quot; which he regards as merely temporary: &quot;Our
involvement in Mercosur and the developed market economies points to an
increasing role for our state's industry in the coming years.&quot;Hans
Meyer, president of the chamber of industry and commerce in the state's
second largest town Blumenau, agrees: &quot;We are living with all the pluses
and minuses of the <I>Plan Real</I>,&quot; he says. &quot;But it's the best
plan we've had yet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Call for lower interest rates </B><BR>
<BR>
Others, like Jorge Ronaldo Pohl, who leads the state retailers' federation,
are less sanguine and note the growth of indebtedness among retailers from
3% to 15% in the past year. When the <I>Plan Real </I>was first introduced,
he says, &quot;we went through a period of euphoria... everyone seemed to
have money. Then, as sales fell, we started to do any deals that came along
without a careful look at the consumer's situation. The only way the sector
will recover is if the government brings down the base rate, which will
bring down interest rates as well.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Angela Amin Helou of the right-wing Progressive Reform Party, who ran for
election as state governor last year, sums up the situation: &quot;It is
undeniable that the <I>Plan Real</I>, by freeing imports and the overvalued
exchange rate, brought undesirable consequences to the economy of Santa
Catarina. The textile, shoe and furniture sectors, for example, are going
through worrying times and small businesses are suffering from lack of credit.
But bad times were never a reason for [us] to get discouraged. We are an
economy that is built to seek efficiency, quality, productivity.&quot; <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>
<H3>FINGER ON THE PULSE </H3>
<B>Santa Catarina's largest company, the biggest processor of soya beans
in Latin America, is expanding </B><BR>
<BR>
Santa Catarina's largest company, the Ceval Alimentos agroindustrial company,
was created 23 years ago as an offshoot of Latin America's dominant textile
company. The firm owes its origins to the then military government which
in the early '70s offered generous tax incentives to encourage diversification.
<BR>
<BR>
It was not long before Ceval had overtaken its parent company. Now it is
Santa Catarina's single largest enterprise, the second largest producer
of chicken and pork products in Brazil, the biggest processor of soya beans
in the whole of Latin America and the fourth largest in the world. Export
revenues last year totalled $960 million and domestic sales brought in $1.18
billion. <BR>
<BR>
Based at Gaspar in Santa Catarina's Itaja&iacute; valley (its name is an
abbreviation of &quot;cereals of the valley&quot;), Ceval started out by
producing sugar but swiftly moved into soya. By 1985 exports accounted for
80% of its business, but as the company has further diversified into meat
products the domestic Brazilian market has steadily grown in importance.
Last year domestic sales overtook exports, a tendency which has dramatically
accelerated this year with the drastic revaluation of the Brazilian currency,
the real. <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, the virtual stagnation of Ceval's export earnings, coinciding with
a striking surge in domestic sales, is typical of the Brazilian economy
as a whole since the advent of the <I>Plan Real</I> stabilisation programme.
To maintain exports in the face of the country's overvalued currency (they
grew just 0.8% in the second quarter of this year, compared to the same
period last year), the company has been forced to sell for little or no
profit. &quot;It has taken us years to win these markets. We're not going
to let our customers down now,&quot; says Herculano Danicio Martins, Ceval's
marketing manager. <BR>
<BR>
As compensation, the dramatic rise in the volume of domestic demand has
led to an enormous increase in the company's sales of consumer products,
which over the same period grew 67.8%. <BR>
<BR>
Today the Ceval empire stretches across 14 states of Brazil and is beginning
to reach abroad, with the acquisition this year of the Argentinean soya
and peanut company, Guipeba, for $60 million. It now has four bases in Argentina.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Altogether we expect to reach $2.48 billion in revenue this year,&quot;
says Ceval directory general Vilmar de Oliveira Schurmann. Meeting this
target would represent an increase of 16% over last year, a considerable
feat given that takings grew by a phenomenal 64%. <BR>
<BR>
At the moment, Ceval's biggest planned investments are concentrated in the
meat products division, with plans to boost revenues from $558 million last
year to around $2 billion by the year 2000. Altogether the company's expansion
plan foresees investments of $326 million between now and 1998, of which
$201 million will be directed towards doubling its existing processing capacity
for pork and chicken, and $38 million towards vegetable oils. <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>

<H3><A NAME="tourism-tech"></A>A BRAZILIAN TECHNOPOLIS  </H3>
<B>The lack of heavy industry makes the state an ideal place to attract
high-tech companies and talent <BR>
<BR>
</B><I>By Noll Scott </I><BR>
<BR>
Santa Catarina, though the smallest of Brazil's southern states, is the
one on which nature has bestowed the greatest variety, making it the leader
in drawing tourists from inside Brazil or abroad. More than 1.5 million
tourists a year come to enjoy its beaches, mountains, waterfalls and medicinal
spas. <BR>
<BR>
It is the capital Florian&oacute;polis that stands out as the most spectacular
attraction. Sited on a long, thin island, Florian&oacute;polis is joined
to the mainland by two bridges: one a modern double-span affair, the other
an 80-year-old British-designed construction of iron and wood. This is the
capital's best known monument although structural problems have closed it
even to pedestrians for the past decade. The geography of the island (confusingly,
also called Santa Catarina), offers 42 beaches on two coastlines - the rougher
shore to the east facing the open ocean, a favourite haunt of surfers, and
the calmer west coast which faces the mainland. Between the two shores are
spectacular freshwater lagoons, perfect for windsurfing and yachting, ringed
by restaurants offering fresh seafood. <BR>
<BR>
It is part of the region's charm that most of its accommodation consists
of informal guest houses and weekend cottage rentals rather than luxurious
hotels, but visitors have to be ready to put up with minor inconveniences
as a result. As Adolfo Ern Filho, director of the Santa Catarina Tourist
authority Santur, acknowledges, there is plenty of room for improvement
in tourist services. &quot;We are working hard to improve the skills of
both the workforce and management,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
A city of around 400,000 people, Florian&oacute;polis has never developed
a serious industrial base and its population is mostly employed in administration
and services, giving the city a placid atmosphere largely free of the pollution
which threatens to engulf many of Brazil's bigger centres. &quot;There is
no place here for heavy industry because it would affect Florian&oacute;polis'
primary industry which is tourism,&quot; says Pedro Sirotsky, vice-president
of the Rede Brasil Sul media network. The state government is therefore
promoting the city as the natural home of new technology, or technopolis.
With its relaxing atmosphere it is not hard to imagine the city becoming
a San Diego of the southern hemisphere, and there would be little problem
in attracting talent: in recent opinion polls, Florian&oacute;polis is the
one Brazilian city that young middle-class graduates say they would like
to live in one day. <BR>
<BR>
Away from Florian&oacute;polis, the state can be divided into five economic
regions. The far west is the home of agro-industry and smallholdings producing
pigs and chicken, which are marketed across Brazil and abroad by large concerns
like Ceval. The region also produces large quantities of soya, garlic, onions,
rice, beans, maize and tobacco. Of these products, poultry ($372 million)
and soya ($289 million) were high on the list of Santa Catarina's exports
to the outside world in 1994. <BR>
<BR>
The south of the state is the traditional home of ceramics such as tiles
and flooring materials, which produced exports worth $97.4 million in 1994.
The Itaja&iacute; Valley, which runs into the ocean about 150km north of
Florian&oacute;polis, is the base for the state's textile industry, whose
output accounted for $295.8 million of exports last year. Engineering, plastics
and chemicals are produced in the north around Joinville, the state's biggest
city, and were responsible for $311 million in overseas sales last year.
Finally, the highlands of the north near the border with the state of Paran&aacute;,
are a booming area for wood and related products, including paper, cellulose
and furniture. Sales of these amounted to $306 million last year.<BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%> 
<H3><A NAME="road-recovery"></A>STOP AND GO POLICIES </H3>
<B>The new highway may only be 25 kilometres long, but it represents a much
longer journey on the road to recovery <BR>
<BR>
</B><I>By Noll Scott </I><BR>
<BR>
At a grand ceremony in the rural heart of Santa Catarina's Itaja&iacute;
valley, all the leading dignitaries of the southern Brazilian state are
on hand to welcome the national president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Beside
a temporary stage erected in the middle of the countryside, a brass band
of the ceremonial guard in full dress uniform stands by to play the national
anthem while loudspeakers entertain the swelling crowds with Brazilian rock,
samba and reggae. <BR>
<BR>
By the time a prolonged volley of firecrackers bursts into the evening sky,
a throng of several thousand is gathered in party mood. It is, after all,
the first presidential visit to the state since Fernando Henrique was elected
precisely a year ago, in October 1994. <BR>
<BR>
And the cause of all the fuss? Two decades after it was first initiated,
a new road is finally being inaugurated. The new road links the small town
of Gaspar in the Itaja&iacute; valley with the neighbouring seaside municipality
of Navegantes. Known as the BR-470, it is just 25 kilometres long. <BR>
<BR>
It would be far too easy to describe this ceremony as overkill, especially
when young state governor Paulo Afonso Vieira portentously proclaims this
short stretch of paved highway to be &quot;the most important public work
of the past 10 years in Brazil&quot; - a country, we hardly need remind
ourselves, of 150 million people and the ninth largest economy in the world.
<BR>
<BR>
To be fair, these 25 kilometres mean a great deal more than just a handy
new link between two neighbouring municipalities. They significantly enhance
the existing road connection which links the Itaja&iacute; valley, one of
Santa Catarina's most important industrial regions, to the agricultural
hinterland to the west and to the expanding port of Itaja&iacute; itself,
where the river runs into the Atlantic Ocean. <BR>
<BR>
But one soon senses the real reason for the fanfare. Rather than the inflated
celebration, this ceremony turns out to be a heartfelt expression of relief
that the sorry saga of delays, escalating budgets and lack of political
will is finally over, a sign of hope that the recent distortions bedevilling
public policy in Brazil are coming to an end. <BR>
<BR>
There are good reasons for the delay. The crisis of military rule from the
late '70s and the subsequent transition to democratic civilian government
coincided with the debt crisis of the '80s. Soaring inflation climaxed at
50% a month as recently as last year, making a mockery of even the most
honest efforts at strategic infrastructural investment. Thus the stop-go
policies of the past two decades have turned out to be a great deal more
stop and a lot less go. <BR>
<BR>
A climate of rampant corruption in which public works were often promoted
and contracts awarded on the basis of bribery, resulted in a full-blown
constitutional crisis and the impeachment of president Fernando Collor in
1992. Inevitably, this played a big part in setting back Brazilian development.
With the central state regularly dishing out federal funds as favours to
the regions, the art of local politics has often appeared indistinguishable
from crude influence-peddling. <BR>
<BR>
<B>A new departure for the state </B><BR>
<BR>
The inauguration of BR-470 turns out to be a new departure in this respect.
Strictly speaking part of the federal road network, its construction was
the responsibility of central government. But in this case, Bras&iacute;lia
was prevailed upon to devolve responsibility: over the past five years,
it has been the Santa Catarina authorities themselves who have had to provide
the lion's share of funds to complete the development. And they have done
so partly by raising private sector finance and partly out of their own
municipal budget. Accordingly, the key political moment of the day comes
when the president reaffirms his campaign promise that the far more strategic
artery crossing Santa Catarina state from north to south, the accident-ridden
BR-101, will be transformed into a modern dual carriageway. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Model for state-business cooperation </B><BR>
<BR>
The present nightmare reality of this highway is summed up in its popular
name, the <I>caminho da morte</I> or road of death. The president adds,
to loud cheers, a promise that the undertaking will be completed before
he leaves office at the end of 1998. <BR>
<BR>
The BR-101 was built two decades ago to handle 6,000 vehicles a day. More
than 20,000 cars and lorries now use it to rumble daily through the state,
whether northwards towards S&atilde;o Paulo or southwards towards Brazil's
southernmost state Rio Grande do Sul and the Uruguayan border. Effusive
in his praise for the &quot;exemplary partnership&quot; of central government,
the Santa Catarina authorities and the private sector in building the Itajai
road, the president adds that the north-south artery will be upgraded using
the same principles. <BR>
<BR>
Down at the end of the new road in Itaja&iacute; itself, these principles
are already being put into effect by the municipal administration, the third
tier of Brazilian government. Since June, Itaja&iacute; has had the unique
responsibility of running its own port, after decades of control by the
S&atilde;o Paulo ports authority CEDESP. In a curious hangover from the
years of military rule, CEDESP remains in charge of most other ports throughout
the country. The authority has won an unenviable reputation for maladminstration,
overmanning, delays, congestion, high charges and corruption. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Port privatisation likely </B><BR>
<BR>
Itaja&iacute;, the largest port in Santa Catarina, handles the fourth largest
volume of freight in the country. The mayor, Arnaldo Schmitt Jr, says efficiency
at the port has &quot;dramatically increased&quot; since its services were
put under local control. Pointing to examples across Europe, he argues that
it should continue to be run as a public utility in close partnership with
local private industry. <BR>
<BR>
But the consensus among Santa Catarina's business community, including senior
executives at companies which make heavy use of Itaja&iacute;, is that costs
would come down further if the port were to be privatised, making that appear
the most probable outcome in the future. <BR>
<BR>
Itaja&iacute; also contains the southern headquarters of the national oil
company Petrobras. It handles administration and offshore supplies for the
oil industry between Angra, in Rio de Janeiro state and the southern frontier
with Uruguay, housing a number of terminals for oil and its derivatives.<BR>

<H3>FROM THE EDITOR</H3> 
<H2>Tale of two cities</H2>

<H4>Middle East and western states must recognise that peace and growth means
relinquishing central power</H4>
Two summit meetings are taking place around the same time, of key importance
to the Middle East. In theory they are both economic in purpose, but both
have a political agenda. The Barcelona Euromed summit in November aims to
promote that most economic of goals, a free trade zone linking the Middle
East to Europe, but foreign ministers alone are attending what is essentially
a political event. The EU is trying to succeed in the Mediterranean where
it failed in Bosnia, and pre-empt serious unrest which could spill over
into its territory. <BR>
<BR>
In contrast it is economic and finance ministers joining their business
counterparts at the World Economic Forum's Middle East/North Africa (MENA)
economic summit, hosted by King Hussein in Amman in late October. But in
deciding how to promote an economic partnership, participants face the geopolitical
question whether it will be the US or Europe which provides leadership.
<BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, the basic issues remain. Will these efforts help deliver
a peace dividend and create the economic prosperity that could reverse the
region's instability, compounded by unemployment, high population growth
and disillusionment with the political status quo? <BR>
<BR>
Some critics argue that the EU's free trade medicine may kill the patient
but it is offering a real benefit: access to its 15 member-states' markets.
At Amman, the priority for participants is to see that the projects announced
there break the mould of classic big-is-beautiful development dominated
by the state, and favour the private sector instead. The region's governments
must come to terms with the fact that more private sector growth -
the only kind that will help break the current patterns of popular disillusionment
- means less state patronage. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, both western and Middle Eastern players are still addicted
to politics rather than economics: either conflict with outsiders or the
internal struggle for power. It is still rare to find authorities paying
attention to their emerging but struggling Arab business elites and asking
them, What do you want? <BR>
<BR>
There are many things to applaud since the first MENA summit in Casablanca
last autumn. The fact that Amman is happening at all is positive, coming
after a fraught Israeli-Palestinian peace process which has only just been
confirmed by a new deal on West Bank self-rule. Israel has also signed a
peace treaty with Jordan and has won wider acceptance by third parties such
as China and Japan, even though the Arab League boycott is not quite lifted.
Joint development of Red Sea tourism has gone ahead, although it remains
something of a showpiece exception. And Amman will put the spotlight on
some striking new possibilities such as the Qatari gas deal with Israel,
initiated under that Gulf state's new leader. <BR>
<BR>
At the time of going to press, however, the proposed regional development
bank championed by Jordan, Israel and the US was still in the balance. Most
objections come from Europe which argues that existing institutions could
take on the role. This is true in theory, but not in practice. The EBRD,
cited as an unpromising model, has now found its feet and is taking the
sort of imaginative approach from which the Middle East could profit with
its own bank. <BR>
<BR>
There is also still no peace deal with Syria. People at Amman will say it
is on the way but more than anyone, Assad's regime needs an outside enemy.
Syria might have hesitated because it expects a bigger reward for peace:
those who have cooperated, like Jordan, have not conspicuously benefited,
despite risking the wrath of a well-organised Islamist opposition. <BR>
<BR>
All parties need to make sure that goodwill is not eroded by small disappointments.
It should be built up by both small, practical successes and basic, bold
moves which make peace pay.<BR>

<H3>ON THE MOVE</H3> 
<H4>EUROPE IN ASIA </H4>
<H2>The China syndrome </H2>
Singapore's elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew, opening this year's Europe-Asia
summit on September 20, returned to his trademark theme: the need to integrate
an unpredictable China into the international community rather than punish
it with trade restrictions, as Washington has shown signs of doing in the
face of human rights and commercial abuses by Beijing. He went on to urge
Europe to become a full partner with east Asia to help reduce US-China tensions,
a goal likely to be advanced by the planned meeting of European and Asian
leaders in Bangkok in March. <BR>
<BR>
Even with an increasingly rich and powerful east Asia, he argued, it was
in everyone's strategic interests for the US to maintain a regional presence
as a countervailing power to Japan and China: &quot;If this triangular relationship
is in balance, the rest of east Asia will be stable,&quot; he concluded.
<BR>
<BR>
Better to establish good relations with China now, before it achieves its
potential, than throw obstacles in the way which will only delay the process
and enrage the future giant. &quot;Integration will build up strong vested
interests in China to play by international rules and increase China's interdependence
for trade,&quot; he said, adding later during questions: &quot;If Asia,
having gained muscle, decides to settle scores, it's going to be a nasty
world.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The Norwegian Prime Minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, responded to this challenge
by agreeing that Asia would simply &quot;go it alone&quot; if Europe stayed
away, but argued that the region would &quot;manage its transition period
better and more effectively if you make full use of what Europe has to offer&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
This included a willingness to engage in public debate: &quot;We cannot
isolate our economic relations from wider mutual general curiosity... people
in the west have opinions and will express [them] about the countries of
east Asia as they have - and do - about their own countries,&quot;
she said. <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%>
<H4>REGIONAL RELATIONS </H4>
<H2>Apec and beyond </H2>
Much discussion in Singapore centred on the structures needed to enhance
relations between Asia and Europe. Korean Prime Minister Hong-Koo Lee said
the two should work &quot;to maintain and strengthen the multilateral trading
system... prevent proliferation of closed regional [trade groups and] make
an effort to keep the existing ones open&quot; so they do not discriminate
against non-members. &quot;East Asia should strive to ensure that Apec adheres
to this principle,&quot; as should the European Union its own single market,
he added. <BR>
<BR>
The Australian foreign minister, Gareth Evans, praised the growth in both
members and scope seen by since the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
over six years but said it still lacked substance and purpose, describing
Apec as &quot;four adjectives in search of a noun&quot;. He called on its
members to flesh out existing agreements when they meet again this November
in Osaka: <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%>
<H4>BUSINESS GUIDE </H4>
<H2>Ten steps to Asian success </H2>
Ian Buchanan, vice-president of Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton, distilled his
consultancy's accumulated wisdom about doing business in the Asia Pacific
region in a quick 10-point summary laced with gritty humour: 
<H4><BR>
* Have a clear corporate vision and role for the Asia Pacific. <BR>
<BR>
* Look before you leap as the region contains a diverse portfolio. <BR>
<BR>
* Follow Asian ways: work like a farmer, not a hunter-gatherer. <BR>
<BR>
* Know-who is just as important as know-how. <BR>
<BR>
* Build a capability to take on allies, but have an exit strategy. <BR>
<BR>
* Promise only what you can deliver, and deliver what you promise. News
travels fast: step on someone's toes in Java, they will hear about it in
Thailand. <BR>
<BR>
* The guy closest to the market has to make the decisions. <BR>
<BR>
* Find the right people to bridge the gap between HQ and the field. They
are probably employees in their 50s with the grey hair Asians take seriously.
<BR>
<BR>
* The contract is just the beginning of the relationship. Making it happen
requires supervision. <BR>
<BR>
* Have a good time! You are going to come across plenty of problems so enjoy
yourself. <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%><BR>MEXICAN INVESTMENT FORUM </H4>
<H2>Guarded optimism </H2>
Meeting with participants at the first-ever Global Investment Forum in September
at his official residence Los Pinos (above), Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo
gave advance details of his country's newly liberalised investment regime,
confirming that he would attach no strings to foreign portfolio investment
and would not be copying Chile's restrictive measures which require foreign
capital to stay in the country for over a year. He also promised incentives
for domestic saving. <BR>
<BR>
The forum, organised by <I>World Link</I> together with Euromoney Conferences,
was attended by key Mexican ministers and over 500 participants from 18
different countries. It was hosted by the Mexican Investment Board. <BR>
<BR>
At a brainstorming session on the outlook for the Mexican economy, led by
Rafael Piccolo of Hewlett Packard in Mexico and Frank Lysy, chief economist
at the World Bank for Mexico and Venezuela, the consensus was one of guarded
optimism. However many participants called on government speakers to say
more about the acute political problems threatening Mexico's economic recovery.

<H2>Peace and dishonour </H2>
<H4>The US peace plan may stop fighting in Bosnia but it could encourage
future proxy wars in the Balkans </H4>
<I>By Jonathan Eyal, director of studies at London's Royal United Services
Institute </I><BR>
<BR>
The vicious circle in the Balkans is going around; after another bout of
fighting peace talks are under way once again. This time, however, there
is a major difference: the Croats and to some extent the Bosnian Muslims
are holding the upper hand over the Serbs, the real culprits in starting
the war. Significantly, the US is now taking a lead in both brokering a
settlement and enforcing it through the power of Nato, the North Atlantic
military alliance. Yet despite this novelty, mayhem is guaranteed unless
the fundamental questions posed by the break-up of Yugoslavia receive an
answer. The problem is not only the Croat-Serb dispute (which has reached
a deadlock of sorts) but the future of Bosnian Muslim territory. <BR>
<BR>
Although hundreds of thousands of Croats and Serbs have been uprooted during
the last four years, no nation has suffered as much as the Muslims. Unlike
the leaders of Croatia and Serbia, who went into the war anticipating violence
with equanimity, President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia did not plan for
war and asked for no one else's territory. The Muslims have been accused
of some atrocities, but few are prepared to compare their behaviour to the
Serbs' premeditated murder campaigns or the vicious behaviour of Croat militia.
<BR>
<BR>
Bosnia stands for more than just a particularly gruesome Balkan tale. In
essence, it was Yugoslavia writ small - a republic in which no ethnic
group held a numeric majority but where Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Croats
and Muslims lived in peace. <BR>
<BR>
Islamic states have shown great interest in the Bosnian crisis. The fate
of Croatia and Serbia appeared initially to be the concern of Europe alone.
However, the fact that a state run by a Muslim-dominated government tried
and failed to preserve its territorial integrity and was even threatened
with complete annihilation, while Europe did nothing, fed long-held suspicions
held in the Middle East and Africa about the perfidy of western governments
and their hostility to an Islamic state in Europe. <BR>
<BR>
The broader question, therefore, is this: will the question of Bosnia have
a long-lasting impact on western relations with Islamic states? The answer
depends on whether a settlement in the Balkans can be followed by the institution
of a regional security system guaranteeing Bosnia's survival as an independent
state. Even if a peace deal does emerge this autumn, the task of repairing
western relations with Islamic states will only just have begun. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Repairing western relations with Islam </B><BR>
<BR>
President Izetbegovic himself is religious, but like many Bosnian Muslims
he is not as devout as his Serb and Croat enemies would suggest in their
desire to perpetuate religious stereotypes. Izetbegovic's official goal
remains that of the traditional, multi-ethnic Bosnia, not an Islamic state.
Many throughout the Middle East who are now championing his cause would
be horrified by Izetbegovic's visions of a multi-ethnic state. It is a vision
which most Islamic governments consider unacceptable and, at best, unworkable.
<BR>
<BR>
The reaction of many Muslim states is related more to a fight for influence,
chiefly between Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Egypt and Malaysia, than to
the search for a Balkan solution. <BR>
<BR>
It is not true that, had Bosnia not been a Muslim country, Europe would
have fought to save it long ago. The west did nothing to help Catholic Croatia
when the Yugoslav war began. This was because the EU believed Yugoslavia
did not really matter, not because it did not want a Muslim state in Europe.
In any case, the Bosnian government never claimed it wanted such a state
in the first place. <BR>
<BR>
Since 1991, those major powers striving for a solution have pursued different
aims. The British and the French governments sent troops to the country
without knowing what they were meant to be achieving, because they wanted
to do something to appease enraged public opinion at home, without doing
much in particular. The result was a UN peace-keeping operation which had
no peace to keep, striving to impose a peace which could not be imposed.
<BR>
<BR>
The Russians were equally disinterested in the conflict but, the moment
the west Europeans arrived on the scene, Moscow was determined to be present
in an area the Russians still consider within their sphere of influence.
And then came the US and Germany, two major powers with no soldiers on the
ground but with great principles which the international community was supposed
to uphold. <BR>
<BR>
The result was a disaster, a tussle between Europeans who wanted an end
to the war on any terms and Americans who wanted to give the Serbs a bloody
nose, preferably by using someone else's soldiers. While this foolish debate
proceeded the Serbs carved up Croatia, split Bosnia into pieces, uprooted
hundreds of thousands of Muslims in the name of ethnic cleansing and humiliated
the UN. On every crisis, the reaction of western governments has been too
feeble, too late, or both. This has been the history of the Yugoslav war.
<BR>
<BR>
Recent Croat offensives in eastern Croatia and western Bosnia, characterised
by lightening speed and huge success, altered the entire Balkan game. There
is no question that the Croats had received arms from the US, although this
was illegal under UN resolutions. For more than two years, the Americans
have brokered a federation between the Croats and Muslims of Bosnia. They
armed both secretly, hoping that this federation would stand up to the Serbs.
<BR>
<BR>
But Washington operated under one serious misconception. Although the Serbs
and Croats will fight each other, they are potential allies in keeping Muslim
Bosnia down. Paradoxically, therefore, the Muslims' survival has always
depended on confrontation between Croats and Serbs; the moment this confrontation
ends, the division of the Muslim Bosnians between their two neighbours becomes
inevitable. <BR>
<BR>
The current American proposals resurrect old Bosnian territorial division
plans, with the Croat-Muslim federation receiving 51% of the land and the
Serbs the rest. The Serbs will be asked to give up territory around the
besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. If the Serbs accept the plan, they
will be rewarded with the abolition of the international economic embargo
which cripples their country. If they reject it, more western air strikes
on Serb positions look inevitable and the re-arming of the Muslims may be
just around the corner. If the Muslims reject the proposals, they face the
withdrawal of UN forces from the republic and they will unable to count
on American assistance. In reality, the plan would satisfy nobody. <BR>
<BR>
The Serbs may be willing to settle: they have more territory than they need
and are desperately keen to break their international isolation. But why
should the Muslims accept such proposals now? In effect, the Americans are
expecting the Bosnians to become reconciled not only to a large loss of
territory, but also to becoming a Croat satellite. And significantly, the
Croats may be tempted by more war. The prize for the Muslims and Croats
is further conquests in western Bosnia, an area controlled by the Serbs.
<BR>
<BR>
If this takes place, Washington can do little: if the principle of liberating
and cleansing Serb-occupied territory is accepted in Croatia, why should
it not be acceptable now in Bosnia? The Croats and the Muslims are unlikely
to give up the struggle when they can get more by continuing to fight. The
idea of arming the Croats and Muslims just enough to defeat the Serbs, but
not too much - to leave the defeat incomplete - is something only
US strategists can conceive of from the comfort of their armchairs in Washington.
<BR>
<BR>
Since the war began the Americans have always sought to achieve a balance
of power in the Balkans. They have failed for a simple reason: the fighting
in Yugoslavia was not only about ethnic purity but also about land. Ethnic
cleansing on its own cannot sort out frontiers. The outlines of a deal are
in place: Serbia will have less land than it had, Croatia more than it envisaged
and Bosnian Muslim independence will remain a dream. But the dividing lines
between Serbs and Croats are unlikely to be settled by western diplomats.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Frustration in London and Paris </B><BR>
<BR>
There is worse to come. Britain and France, with the most peace-keeping
troops on the ground, are becoming increasingly frustrated by American and
German encouragement for the Croats. Sitting on the fence while the US supplies
weapons to one side for the fighting to continue is unappealing. More importantly,
the Russians still want to be taken seriously in the Balkans. <BR>
<BR>
The collective will of the EU has been exposed as a sham and so has the
UN's effort. Washington is now drafting peace plans without consulting people
in the region and it makes threats of force without any reference to the
UN. Everyone still talks about inviolable frontiers while, in practice,
proposing to carve up a state according to plans hurriedly scribbled by
diplomats on cigarette packets. <BR>
<BR>
On one issue, however, the Americans can still claim triumph: they have
positioned themselves as the ally of the Bosnian Muslims, not a bad position
for a government that wants to promote stability in the Islamic world at
large. But President Clinton's administration can succeed in brokering a
deal only if it rams its plans down Bosnia's throat. In the end, the US
will not be thanked for its efforts. <BR>
<BR>
A peace with honour is no longer achievable in the Balkans. Slowly, the
entire area is reverting to its history as a region where the bigger powers
support proxy wars, not because they have any interest in the natives but
because they have bigger scores to settle with each other. These are murky
waters which may tempt Islamic fundamentalists throughout the world. And
the chances are that such a gloomy scenario can no longer be avoided.<p>

<H3>REVIEW</H3> 
<H2>Grave and profane </H2>
<H4>The Moor's Last Sigh </H4>
<I>by Salman Rushdie<BR>
Jonathan Cape, &#163;15.99 <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reviewed by Adel Darwish, The Independent</B></I><B> </B><BR>
<BR>
On this novel's very first page there is a subtle reference to the world-famous
predicament faced by the author, who is sometimes accused of needlessly
provoking the Ayatollah's death sentence for blasphemy imposed on him six
years ago, and still in force today. <BR>
<BR>
Describing the final flight of his protagonist Moraes (Moor) Zogoiby, in
a parallel story of the last leader to leave Moorish Spain, he writes in
one of many Lutheran references: &quot;When my pursuers have followed the
trail they'll find me waiting... Here I stand. Couldn't've done it differently.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
It is a small defiance: the bigger one is Rushdie's persistence in treating
controversial themes. Presenting his latest work to the public, he worked
hard to remind everyone that he is a novelist not a politician but Rushdie's
work was always imbued with a sharp awareness of political foibles. Before
the Islamic <I>fatwa</I>, the main criticism levelled at his work was at
its unreadability. It was always more accessible for those whose experience,
like that of this reviewer, was marked by the same mixed identities and
cultural transplantations. <BR>
<BR>
This newest work is fun to read, while keeping Rushdie's usual panoramic
style. In what has become his trademark, he has fun with the names of characters
who mirror real-life politicians. The book contains a ribald caricature
of Hindu fundamentalist Bal Thackeray, leader of the extremist (and worryingly
popular) party Shiv Sena and regarded by many as the unofficial ruler of
Bombay, Rushdie's city of birth. In the book Thackeray is named after another
English novelist, Fielding, and portrayed as a vicious and crazed stormtrooper
with a weakness for beautiful women. Bombay's Maharashtra state is considering
banning it. <BR>
<BR>
<I>The Moor's Last Sigh</I> is Rushdie's latest attempt to catch up with
Indian history since his first novel <I>Midnight's Children</I>, now rather
dated in its focus on Indira Gandhi's state of emergency in the mid-70s.
In a similar vein to Lord Byron's <I>Don Juan</I>, Rushdie mixes the gravest
of events with obscenities. While Byron produced an epic narrative of the
French revolution and the inception of the rights of man, his preoccupation
is with the Hindu/Muslim conflict. This bawdy approach to sacred events
banned Byron from civilised society and led Rushdie to experience fundamentalism
as a form of literary criticism. But the combination of the grave and the
profane remains the secret of both mens' brilliance and an essential tool
in interpreting human history. <BR>
<BR>
<I>The Moor's Last Sigh</I> traces the fate of a wealthy family of spice
merchants through the last century. Moor is the sole survivor of his line.
He is a baffled innocent who entered the world after only four and a half
months' gestation and is cursed to grow at double speed. At the age of 10
he is a strapping, fully grown man. At 36 he resembles an asthmatic 72-year-old.
A typically grotesque Rushdie hero, Moor's right hand is a deformed clubbed
fist. <BR>
<BR>
The central female character is of Catholic Portuguese blood yet Indian
in sentiment. The artist Aurora has children out of wedlock with an Indian
Jew dubbed with an Arab name. She could not have lived and survived in any
other age or continent but Rushdie's Bombay. Alongside Aurora, Bombay becomes
a living character. Like the traumatic love of one who adores a partner,
yet hates them when they do not live up to expectations, Rushdie himself
loves the city and can still hate it when corruption and violence blow it
apart. <BR>

<H4>Winnie-the-Pooh on Management </H4>
<I>by Roger Allen<BR>
Methuen, &#163;6.95 </I>
<H4>Mind Your Manners </H4>
<I>by John Mole<BR>
Nicholas Brealey Publishing, &#163;9.99 <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reviewed by Andrew Clark</B></I><B> </B><BR>
<BR>
This is the final indignity for Pooh Bear, the much-loved children's character
created by English writer AA Milne. In <I>Winnie-the-Pooh on Management</I>,
a management consultant arrives to rationalise Pooh and his friends in the
Hundred Acre Wood. Pooh, by his own admission a &quot;Bear of Very Little
Brain&quot;, discovers how directionless he is and sets out on the road
to streamlining his activities which consist mainly of a search for his
favourite food, honey. Even his appearance gets a make-over from the image
consultants, to give him more authority as he supervises the activities
of Piglet and Tigger. <BR>
<BR>
Roger Allen's book is an attempt to present management theory in the simplest
possible way. According to him, study of Japanese management techniques
and zero-base budgeting have obscured the basic principles of effective
leadership. Pooh's consultant stresses the need for clarity of objectives
and sets universal guidelines for good leadership. Information should be
as clear and complete as possible, relevant to the person receiving it and
given in several different ways to ensure understanding. Always confirm that
the information has been absorbed, Allen advises, and remember that actions
speak louder than words. Pooh learns similar guidelines for motivation,
delegation, setting objectives, developing people and anticipating problems.
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Winnie-the-Pooh on Management</I> is lightly written and at times amusing
in a whimsical way. The advice can help clear an untidy mind and need not
only apply to business: it could be of use to any individual wanting to
organise a hectic private life. It is a common-sense introduction to those
who have rarely given a thought to the practice of management. And to CEOs
it could be a breath of fresh air, questioning all the assumptions which
can become blurred as a job becomes more complicated. <BR>
<BR>
The limitations of Pooh's common-sense approach are brought out in a new
edition of <I>Mind Your Manners</I>, an updated edition of John Mole's guide
to the different business cultures to be found in the members-states of
the European Union, a useful reference book for anyone expanding their business
in the region based on his own personal experiences. The guide devotes a
chapter to each country, explaining local decision-making practices, company
structures, etiquette and business-related legislation. <BR>
<BR>
Mole's description of an everyday business meeting provides clues to the
minefield that can await even the simplest task. A German will have studied
any briefing circulated before a meeting and will contribute only when he
or she feels qualified to do so: a Briton may have only glanced through
the briefing and will consider it normal for everyone to chip in with on-the-spot
suggestions on any topic. The French prefer an adversarial style, expecting
to be contradicted but also expecting to win the argument with logic and
rationality. But Spaniards will be desperately embarrassed at being contradicted
and will only speak if sure of their ground. In Portugal and Luxembourg,
meetings are for briefing and discussion only, whereas for the Dutch a meeting
which ends without a firm decision is a failure. Although these are stereotypes,
Mole argues that without understanding such details, firms cannot work together.
Common sense is not enough. <BR>
<BR>
There is a tendency to lapse into truisms in any survey of national characteristics
but Mole's book contains much solid information, including tips on when
humour is appropriate and when to be punctual. For a party at 7pm, for example,
polite guests in Japan may arrive an hour early and in Germany they will
come on the dot, while they will be 15 minutes late in Britain and arrive
close to midnight in Greece. <BR>
<BR>
Mole concludes by identifying two dimensions for firms and cultures. The
organisation as a mix ranges from the organic, in which the firm evolves
with little planning, to the systematic in which rigid, logically constructed
rules determine all business practices. The other dimension is leadership,
which ranges in style from individual and autocratic to group orientated,
consultative and flexible. He argues that the position of any firm can be
plotted on these two axes and guides us to where firms in each country are
likely to lie. <BR>
<BR>
Mole's map theory is simple but brings out the complexity and heterogeneity
existing in the world of management. Winnie the Pooh's theory is equally
simple but assumes that the world is as uncomplicated and friendly as the
Hundred-Acre Wood. <BR>

<H2>Germ warfare </H2>
<H4>The Coming Plague </H4>
<I>By Laurie Garrett<BR>
Farrar Straus Giroux, $25.00 <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reviewed by Lance Knobel <BR>
<BR>
</B>The Coming Plague</I> combines a series of remarkable adventure yarns,
scientific detective stories and carefully paced horror stories. Uniting
this unexpected amalgam is an urgent polemic directed at policymakers around
the world. Laurie Garrett persuasively and meticulously makes the case for
more attention - and money - to worldwide issues of public health
and what she terms microbial ecology. Garrett's plea is provoked by the
fact that in the competition between people and microbes, the microbes are
winning. <BR>
<BR>
As Nobel prizewinner and World Economic Forum fellow Joshua Lederberg says
in the book, &quot;We're not alone at the top of the food chain.&quot; Such
statements are on the surface sensational. But <I>The Coming Plague</I>,
despite its alarmist title, is not a sensationalist work. The power of Garrett's
argument comes from the evidence of cool research demonstrated, for example,
by 104 pages of footnotes. <BR>
<BR>
It is a difficult book at times, but it repays the reader with extraordinary
tales. At the centre are what Garrett calls the &quot;disease cowboys&quot;,
virologists and epidemiologists who at considerable personal risk go into
the field to track down a mysterious disease and find a cure. The cowboys
arrive in the Bolivian rainforest to deal with an outbreak of hemorrhagic
fever, in Liberia to confront Lassa fever and most dramatically in Zaire
to tackle Ebola. <BR>
<BR>
With limited resources, virtually no supporting infrastructure, in conditions
of enormous local tension and stress and not infrequently facing political
hostility, scientists like Karl Johnson, Joe McCormick, Peter Piot and Uwe
Brinkmann manage to hunt down disease vectors (the means of transmission),
collect and study blood samples and try, in the midst of everything, to
find ways to control outbreaks of at times horrifying illnesses. <BR>
<BR>
Such heroics fill roughly the first third of the book. The middle third
is concerned with the origins of Aids, which becomes a recurrent theme in
the final chapters. At first, the switch in focus is jarring. But for Garrett
and her scientific witnesses the global Aids epidemic is both the largest
current health challenge and a very visible example of the challenges humanity
faces with previously unknown diseases. <BR>
<BR>
The optimism that most infectious diseases could be eradicated worldwide
reigned well into the '60s and '70s in the health policymaking community.
Intelligent observers, according to Garrett, began to doubt the rosy predictions
as a host of diseases, from malaria to tuberculosis and measles, not only
persisted but became ever more serious problems as resistant strains evolved
to confound scientists. Aids marked the climactic puncturing of the optimists'
bubble. <BR>
<BR>
Low-end estimates of HIV infection rates in sub-Saharan Africa start at
20% of the population; many sober estimates push beyond 50%. The same pattern
is being repeated in parts of Asia, notably in Thailand and India. And the
stricken population is typically the most economically active portion. The
result is - or soon will be - monopolisation of already overstretched
health budgets and a dramatic impact on economic growth rates, trimming
up to several per cent a year from GDP growth. <BR>
<BR>
The World Health Organisation (WHO) predicts a total economic burden in
Thailand from Aids of $9 billion by the year 2000; the US Census Bureau
predicts that by 2010 Thailand will have 25 million fewer people than it
would have had without Aids. <BR>
<BR>
Despite this litany of grim statistics and even grimmer prognostications,
Garrett does offer possible solutions: a new understanding of the importance
of public health efforts and continuing improvements to basic health care,
sanitation and water supplies in the developing world. Garrett describes
other possible steps. What is shocking is their financial modesty. <BR>
<BR>
American physician Donald Henderson, who led the successful programme that
eradicated smallpox worldwide, has called for $150 million to be spent annually
for a surveillance network of 15 tropical outpost laboratories, staffed
by local health professionals and scientists from the US Centres for Disease
Control (CDC) in preference to the UN's WHO, which Henderson considers hopelessly
bureaucratic. <BR>
<BR>
In October this year, the WHO finally agreed to set up an early-warning
system and rapid reaction force. The plan echoes many of Garrett's suggestions.
Let us hope her strictures about the UN body's inefficiencies prove false.

<H3>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</H3> 
<H2>Forum insights</H2>
<BR>
<B>The World Economic Forum is today the foremost international membership
organization integrating leaders from business, government and academia
into a partnership committed to improving the state of the world. It provides
a platform for interaction that is direct, efficient, global and personalised
on the highest level. <BR>
The World Economic Forum is a foundation serving the global public interest.
It is independent, impartial and not-for-profit, tied to no political, partisan
or regional interests.</B><BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>
<H3>Members day </H3>
Usually an anniversary is a time to reflect on the past. Not so for the World
Economic Forum. Our first ever Members Day, which took place in late August,
proved the perfect opportunity to share with our members the vision that
will be guiding the Forum during the next quarter century. About 100 member
companies from around the world were represented during the two-day event,
mixing in genuine Forum fashion some very serious work with equally memorable
cultural and social highlights. 
<H3>Four principal strategies for the future </H3>
Klaus Schwab, founder and President of the World Economic Forum, focused
during the working session on four principal strategies. <BR>
<BR>
<B>1. The digital information and communication revolutions: WELCOM</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The natural evolution for the Forum - after becoming the world leader
in face-to-face, personalised, high level networking - is to lead our
members into the age of digital, virtual interaction and to create an exclusive
global WELCOM (<B>W</B>orld <B>El</B>ectronic <B>Com</B>munity). This will
strengthen our position as the world leader in high-level peer interaction.
<BR>
<BR>
In its design philosophy, services and custom features, WELCOM will go far
beyond the technical attractiveness of standard desk-top, on-line systems.
It will integrate personal video communication technology with data-conferencing
features that will allow members to improve dramatically the quality of
their dialogue with peers and to access a range of high value-added information.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>2. Added value and strength of purpose will reinforce global networking</B><BR>
<BR>
Creating a network is one thing, sustaining it with meaningful content is
another. Over the last 25 years we have been pioneers in building global
communities. These communities are now well established and interact regularly
(at the moment through meetings, later also through WELCOM). On a number
of fronts, the Forum intends to increase the quality of its work, and an
important focus will be to maintain and improve the calibre of our permanent
staff. To be truly at the cutting edge of new thinking, for example we will
continue our Forum Fellows programme so that the network includes the world's
leading authorities on all subjects of interest to our members - the
global business community. <BR>
<BR>
<B>3. Twin pillars of membership <BR>
<BR>
</B>We have already established a core group of members that represent the
1000 foremost global enterprises. Taking into account that the global economy
is increasingly influenced by more nimble, niche-oriented companies, we have
begun building a second pillar of membership: the Global Growth Companies.
GGCs are distinguished by their high growth rates, global thinking and critical
mass (roughly US$ 100-750 million in turnover) which already make them key
players in their industries and regions. They are the companies active in
the industries of tomorrow (such as information technologies), hidden champions
(innovative firms in mature industries) and emerging market pioneers. GGCs
will have an annual meeting each year at the Industry Summit and will of
course be key participants in WELCOM. <BR>
<BR>
<B>4. A members-driven foundation</B> <BR>
<BR>
The first twenty-five years of the World Economic Forum were, without doubt,
founder-driven; the challenge now is to transform the organisation into
one which institutionalises the role of our member companies. Thus, in addition
to strengthening the Executive Board as the main managerial instrument of
the foundation, we will create the Council of the World Economic Forum,
to include some of the most prominent chief executives of our member companies.
<H3>Mixing work with pleasure </H3>
The highly interactive working session led to much feedback and reactions,
and a lively debate followed. With a number of useful suggestions from our
members, the Forums Executive Board was able to refine these strategies.
<BR>
<BR>
The afternoon was spent with a brief visit to the Bodmeriana Library in
Cologny, one of the world's most extensive private collections of rare and
antique books, and visits to the European Organisation for Nuclear Research
(CERN) and the new World Trade Organisation (WTO). High level, Forum-style
discussions took place with leaders of both organisations. <BR>
<BR>
A special dinner that evening marked the occasion, gathering members and
their spouses, heads of Geneva-based international organisations and the
local Geneva state councillors. The next day a sightseeing tour of some
of the local Swiss sites, such as the Chateau de Chillon and the cheese-making
village of Gruyeres capped an event which the World Economic Forum was proud
to dedicate to its core constituency, the chief executives of its member
companies. <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>
<H3>1995 Europe/East Asia Economic Summit Singapore 20-22 September 1995
</H3>
There were fewer criticisms from both sides in the World Economic Forum
1995 Europe/East Asia Summit, noted former French Prime Minister Raymond
Barre at the closing session of the fourth annual economic summit. <BR>
<BR>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan did remark that Europe should
&quot;listen to the market rather than attempt to prop up industries that
are no longer competitive&quot;. But references to &quot;fortress&quot;
Europe, on the whole, were hardly heard in this year's summit. <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps East Asia and Europe have come to a better understanding of one
another since last year's summit. <BR>
<BR>
The final proposal read out by Mr Barre called on the two sides to broaden
their political dialogue - including on issues like social and human
rights. But it emphasised that the dialogue &quot;should be based on the
principles of strict non-interference in domestic affairs and mutual respect.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
East Asia, however, continued to urge for stronger ties with Europe. &quot;Singapore
would like to see Asia's links with Europe increased,&quot; said Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong in a keynote address. &quot;They will never be as close as
the links between Europe and the North but they can be better than now.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Asian leaders, in particular, would like to see the first Asia-Europe Meeting
(ASEM) in Thailand next year develop in parallel with the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum (APEC) to promote global free trade. European Commission's
Vice-President Leon Brittan agreed: &quot;Above all, Asia and Europe have
the same trade and investment agenda. This must be the bedrock of our continued
relationship.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Indonesia's President Soeharto reaffirmed his country's commitment to free
trade and gave added assurance to Europeans that Indonesia would not exclude
them from the gains of its tariff reductions. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Some of Asia's most important economic partners lie outside (APEC)
or AFTA (Asean Free Trade Area),&quot; he said. &quot;More than 15 per cent
of Indonesia's exports went to Europe in 1994, while Europe accounted for
roughly 20 per cent of our imports and foreign investments. As a result,
Indonesia adhered to the most favoured nation principle in all our reduction
to trade barriers and urged others to follow.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Vice-President Manuel Marin of the European Commission went a step further
to push for more comprehensive ties, involving citizens, businessmen, researchers
and students. &quot;The Asia-Europe Meeting of spring 1996 will be a historical
occasion enhancing our mutual understanding, but no amount of policy dialogue
can replace solid economic and cultural links,&quot; he said. <BR>
<BR>
He noted that the EU was already working on two significant linkage projects:
<BR>
<BR>
* A high-level cultural forum which would gather 30 Asian and 30 European
intellectuals to discuss philosophy, religion, technological and cultural
exchanges and managerial approaches. <BR>
<BR>
* A pilot exchange programme for 1,000 young Europeans and Asean managers.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We can create the framework and provide the impetus, but the actual
construction of a working partnership can only be based on the efforts of
our people,&quot; Mr Marin said. <BR>
<BR>
Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, in her address at the opening
dinner, said that efforts are being made in Europe to better understand
Asia. But she added: &quot;As much as we Europeans must learn more about
Asia, Asian countries should reflect on what they can do to explain better
the roots of their own cultures and why it is, and what it is, that makes
us different.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
East Asians also want Europe to step up its presence in the region, especially
in the area of investments. &quot;No major European MNC can afford to be
left out of the dynamic growth in East Asia, Singapore's Senior Minister
Lee Kuan Yew said in his keynote address. &quot;The next 30 years will witness
a Pacific revival, a renaissance.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Mr Lee also made a case in geo-political terms: &quot;Europe's participation
(in East Asia) will reduce the economic impact of any China-US turbulence
in the rest of the region.&quot; European companies' willingness to impart
technology would give them an edge over Japanese rivals in East Asia, he
said. <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>
<H3>Regional Activities India Meeting </H3>
<H4>New Delhi, 3-5 December 1995 in partnership with the Confederation of
Indian Industry (CII) </H4>
<I>India: an economic giant in the making</I> India is now a priority partner
for international investors with its dynamic and buoyant private sector,
with expanding infrastructure needs and a growing, quality-demanding middle
class. Our meeting will focus on four areas of primary importance for business
activity in India: the economic, financial and social situation; the growing
importance of Indian states in promoting business activities; the most promising
industry sectors for foreign and domestic investment; contact with senior
policy-making officials in boardroom-style meetings. Also on the agenda will
be India's position at the heart of a revived South Asian trading bloc and
an emerging Ocean Rim economic grouping. <BR>
<BR>
We shall also assess the political situation of the country following the
reverses that the ruling Congress Party has recently suffered in State Elections
and the outlook for the general elections which will take place before June
1996.<BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>

priorities, and set forth an action agenda for business and governments
world-wide. The Annual Meeting will once again be hosting the chief executives
of its member companies, many heads of state and other political leaders,
as well as numerous scientific, economic and business academics and experts.
<BR>
<BR>
This year's Annual Meeting will focus on the complex relations between man,
mankind and markets. Discussions will address the many pressing issues facing
the individual, as well as the global business and policy-making community.
Specific topics will include the growing inequality brought about by our
information society, the changing nature of employment, the increasing concern
over personal, regional and global security systems. Also planned are a
number of intellectually stimulating and philosophical treks into the essence
of life and its very foundations. 
<H3>1996 Industry Summit </H3>
<H4>Chicago, 12-14 May </H4>
The World Economic Forum's on-campus gathering of corporate and entrepreneurial
leaders, tapping the world's foremost knowledge on industry, management
and technology issues hosted by the University of Chicago in collaboration
with Northwestern University and the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations.
<BR>
<BR>
Many corporate leaders recognise that we are entering an increasingly fast-moving
business environment where <I>knowledge</I> will be the key and where the
ability to find, understand and act on the most relevant knowledge will make
the difference between success and failure. To provide these leaders with
a highly time-efficient way to explore the latest knowledge connected with
their industries, the World Economic Forum created the Industry Summit concept.

<H3>TIME OUT</H3> 

<H2>The real high-fliers </H2>
<H4>Time, trust and a love of nature are the rare qualities needed for the
lofty sport of falconry</H4>
<I>By Daniel Butler </I><BR>
<BR>
&quot;Falconry and Zen Buddhism are the two most important influences on
my attitude to life,&quot; pronounces Yvon Chouinard, president of the Californian-based
company Patagonia, a leading manufacturer of sports equipment and leisurewear.
The mountaineer-turned-businessman, aged 57, does not bat an eyelid as he
makes this surprising statement. &quot;From these, I learned infinite patience
and that reward is the only motivation,&quot; he adds seriously. <BR>
<BR>
Forget golf and squash, advises Chouinard, get hooked on hawks. He is not
alone; this ancient sport which harnesses the bird's natural hunting abilities
has a dedicated global following, notably in central Asia, Europe and the
US. Its greatest exponents, however, are found in the Arab world, where
for many urban Bedouins the traditional desert hawking safari or <I>shikar</I>
is a vital link with a lost nomadic past. <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, for many Arabs gifts of falcons and accessories are still an important
part of doing business, as British craftsman Martin Jones readily testifies:
&quot;Half my furniture [falconry equipment] goes to the Gulf.&quot; Ornate
hoods, used to pacify the birds, comprise the bulk of his orders. He also
sells made-to-measure gloves, special perches and radio-tracking devices,
useful for birds which can fly at 80kph on the flat and well over 200kph
in a dive. <BR>
<BR>
Such telemetry is a rare 20th century intrusion into a sport which dates
from China's Hia dynasty, circa 2200BC. From here it spread westwards, reaching
Babylon by 1700BC and becoming popular in Europe in about the 9th century
AD. For the next millennium, until reliable firearms supplanted it, falconry
was one of the most efficient forms of hunting. <BR>
<BR>
But its appeal was always much more than a means of filling the pot. Birds
of prey or raptors are powerful symbols. The Athenians adopted the owl as
their mascot, which explains its undeserved association with wisdom. Attila
the Hun destroyed the Roman Empire with a goshawk on his helmet. Others
harnessed the image in heraldry. Both the Habsburgs and Romanovs, for example,
took the double-headed eagle as their symbol while the US uses the bald
eagle. <BR>
<BR>
Falconry reinforced these images, its social cachet underlined when the
Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II wrote the first treatise on the subject
in 1247. At about the same time Richard the Lionheart went on crusade with
300 hawks, providing his warriors with something to do during sieges. As
late as the 18th century, Catherine the Great was a devotee of lark hawking.
Although the sport subsequently declined, peregrines were used successfully
during both the 1871 siege of Paris and World War Two to intercept messenger
pigeons - an early version of Internet hacking. Even today some airforces
use them to discourage other birds from the runway, where they may collide
expensively and dangerously with jet engines. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fed up and in a bate </B><BR>
<BR>
Perhaps unsurprisingly, a sport which dominated European culture for so
long has left its mark on the English language. A bate, for example, is
a hawk's tantrum. To gorge comes from the French for throat, since a hawk's
crop is located in the neck which swells as it eats. But perhaps the most
common expression is &quot;fed up&quot;. A replete human is neither grumpy
nor bored, but full of bonhomie. Similarly, a hawk which has eaten will
be contented but the impact of this on its bond with the falconer is dramatic.
A bird which is fed up loses its appetite and the incentive to please its
trainer. It wants to find a lofty perch where it can digest in peace, ignoring
the frustrated whistles from below. <BR>
<BR>
Some of the terms can be confusing, however. For example, a hawk is a general
term covering any raptor but also specifically refers to true hawks such
as the Japanese favourite, the goshawk. True hawks live in forests and are
characterised by their short wings. In contrast a falcon is one of the long-winged
high-flyers which hunt over open ground such as the peregrine, merlin or
saker. To the outsider such distinctions may seem pedantic, but they are
critical to falconers. True hawks are the workhorses of falconry: early
writers dubbed the goshawk as the cook's bird thanks to its rapacious skill.
But it is the speed, height and power of a falcon which makes it the ultimate
hunting bird. <BR>
<BR>
Whatever the type, the principles are the same. Controlling the bird's diet
has always remained the key. Where other primitive hunting practices now
seem barbaric, falconry's underlying principle is a kind of social contract.
Food is the key with which the wild bird is coaxed into accepting the presence
of man, then goaded to eat on the fist, before gradually being persuaded
to fly to the falconer for food. The bird is never punished - meat
is merely withheld until it behaves correctly. This is what Chouinard means
by &quot;reward as the only motivation&quot;. Eventually trust is established
for the hawk to fly free while the falconer flushes quarry for it. <BR>
<BR>
What this reward might be depends on the hawk and the locality. For the
Arabs nothing beats houbara, a goose-sized desert bird, as a target for
saker falcons. In Europe catching red grouse with peregrines is the sport's
pinnacle, while in central Asia it is traditional to hunt foxes and wolves
on horseback with eagles. Nor should one forget the US, where enthusiasts
hand-rear chicks to establish parent-child relationships and organise competitions
where the birds win points for speed and style. <BR>
<BR>
Persuading a wild loner like a hawk to co-operate with the human requires
infinite patience, a point which explains Chouinard's philosophical claim.
In his case falconry helped to determine the whole course of his life, beginning
with the time when he played truant as a youth to climb cliffs in search
of prairie falcons (even well-trained hawks revert rapidly to the wild and
losses are high). From this he became hooked on mountaineering, only to
find his expertise outstripping the available equipment. In frustration
he began to make his own and the rest, as they say, is history. <BR>
<BR>
Although the hawks are neither scarce nor expensive, and the cost of equipment
negligible, the patience needed for falconry makes it a hobby of the affluent.
A pair or cast of peregrines are together worth only about $1,000, for example.
But to fly them at grouse one needs a good moor, obedient dogs and, crucially,
time. Hawks need at least two weeks to become fit. Serious falconers spend
two months hunting, during which use of the moor alone can be hugely expensive.
When time is money, few can afford such a long break. <BR>
<BR>
Such fanatics do exist, however. One committed group of Italian peregrine
enthusiasts makes an annual summer pilgrimage to Scotland, while a band
of Germans flies eagles at east European hares each winter. But pride of
place goes to the Arabs, who still approach falconry in the same style as
the medieval kings of Europe. A serious <I>shikar</I> involves dozens of
falcons, handlers, jeeps and tents and can last for months, deep in a desert
anywhere between Pakistan and Algeria. <BR>
<BR>
The sport is also rare in offering a modern outdoor pastime which is environmentally
beneficial. Unlike most field sports it depends completely on both prey
and predators. Thus its practitioners have always been among the most passionate
conservationists, in marked contrast to shooting or fishing enthusiasts.
Just as medieval kings penalised disturbances at hawk's nests, there are
modern equivalents. <BR>
<BR>
The Abu Dhabi royal family spends heavily on conservation, for example.
Last year its National Avian Research Centre released 123 satellite-tagged
Khazak sakers, of which one was followed to Kenya. The same centre also
funded a study of Pakistani luggers, useless for falconry, which are endangered.
And it was US falconers who first noticed the devastating impact of agricultural
pesticides on peregrines and then bred birds in captivity. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Breeding hybrids in captivity </B><BR>
<BR>
Such projects have revolutionised this, the most traditional of sports.
Until recently all hawks came from the wild: either as chicks from a nest,
as in Europe, or adult birds captured while migrating, as preferred by the
Arabs. A dramatic drop in wild populations 30 years ago forced falconers
to turn to captive-breeding. This soon led to the production of hybrids:
mating two species to produce a bird which does not occur in the wild. Falconers
found that such youngsters could often out-perform their parents when they
combined, for example, the high-flying of the traditional European peregrine
with the size and power of an Arab saker. <BR>
<BR>
The results have impressed even the Abu Dhabi royal family, a former bastion
of traditional falconry. The family now funds a New Zealander, Nick Fox,
to produce hybrids to order in Britain, since it is too hot for falcons

<BR>
Once a year he boards a specially chartered plane with 50 young hybrids
in tow: &quot;There's one handler to every two birds, so it's quite a procession
across the tarmac!&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
Regardless of hawk, region or quarry, should you be lucky enough to be invited
to watch this sport, seize the opportunity. This is corporate entertainment
at its most spectacular: only a philistine could remain impervious to the
sight of a hawk in hot pursuit. Sadly, such an experience is likely to be
only too fleeting. The pressures of modern life mean few of us will find
our lives as revolutionised as Patagonia's Chouinard.  <p>

<H3>BACKSEAT</H3>
<H4>Charles Darwent peers through his windows at the murky world of business
espionage </H4>
The more observant among <I>Backseat</I>'s readers may have been aware of
the launch of a new product by an American computer software company, intended
to corner the world market in systems or programs or whatever it is that
makes personal computers gobble up 8,000 words of finely honed prose seconds
before you remember to press the save button. <BR>
<BR>
To describe this product launch as epic is scarcely to exaggerate. The chairman
of the corporation that had wrought this wonder was proclaimed by the evangelists
of the world's press as a new messiah. <BR>
<BR>
The software, meanwhile, was the stuff of which miracles are born. If it
could not actually help the lame to walk or the blind to see, its allegedly
foolproof format could allow even journalists on bimonthly magazines to
master the arcana of downloading or up-booting or whatever else might be
required of them in this post-carbon-paper world. It was also rumoured to
make a mean gazpacho. <BR>
<BR>
So loud, indeed, was the jingling noise of the world press caravanserai
that one minor facet of this heart-warming story somehow came to be overlooked.
For all the obvious desirabilities of the new gospel of plug 'n' play -
computeristes would seem to be painfully susceptible to the charms of alliteration
- a peculiarly similar product was already on the market. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Waiter, there's a download in my soup </B><BR>
<BR>
The search for a personal computerspeak that could be mastered by those
without post-doctoral degrees in Sanskrit had been largely pioneered by
a rival US company during the preceding decade. A series of economic reverses
had simply meant that the digital David in question could not afford (as
could the new messiah) the billion or so dollars needed to bring these joyous
tidings to all the world by dint of buying up the entire daily print-run
of selected national newspapers. It was left to the syndicated US cartoonist
Garry Trudeau to mention the unmentionable. In the seditious words of <I>Doonesbury</I>
the gospel of plug 'n' play was nothing new. <BR>
<BR>
One senses that, whatever his artistic talents, Mr Trudeau may not have
attended one of the better business schools. Had he done so, he would have
realised the laughable na&iuml;vety of his satire. The barbs aimed at alleged
plagiarists missed the mark. There is a more sophisticated idiom favoured
by those sensitive graduates of Cambridge, Mass, Fontainebleau and Stanford
to describe the process of profiting from other people's hard work. That
idiom is &quot;gathering competitor intelligence&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
For those na&iuml;fs, like Mr Trudeau, who may find the difference between
the two concepts bewilderingly slight, help is at hand. A new <I>Financial
Times</I> book, <I>Perfectly Legal Competitor Intelligence</I> (a title
that may in itself strike the uninitiated as exuding a distant whiff of
illegality) defines intelligence-gathering in the world of business as: &quot;A
process that transforms disaggregated competitor data into actionable strategic
knowledge about competitors' capabilities, intentions, performance and position&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
From this you will see that any initial resemblance between what MBA lecturers
call competitor intelligence (CI to <I>aficionados</I>) and what your teacher
at school will quaintly have termed &quot;cheating&quot; is entirely coincidental.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Term prize for peeping </B><BR>
<BR>
Had you, during those laughably illogical days of childhood, been caught
peeping over the shoulder of your neighbour during Latin lessons, you might
well have expected to be rewarded with a rap across the knuckles and 100
lines on the virtuous nature of Lars Porsena of Clusium. Do so during your
MBA finals, and you will presumably find yourself clapped warmly on the
back by your college principal and awarded a term prize for imaginative
disaggregated data gathering. <BR>
<BR>
It will be a useful addition to your CV, for garnering competitor intelligence
is not merely a question of feeding off big business. In this year of grace,
CI has become big business of its own. According to a survey by security
consultants Control Risks, an unwitting 70% of western firms have had apparently
confidential information gathered from them in the past 12 months. <BR>
<BR>
This of course suggests that a further and entirely witting 70% of firms
will have paid for the information to be gathered in the first place. Since
there is presumably what we Venn diagramistes call a high degree of overlap
between the two groups, and since the cost of gathering intelligence from
others while simultaneously ensuring that none is gathered from oneself
may, for a major transnational, run into many millions of dollars annually,
bemused readers of <I>Perfectly Legal etc</I> may find themselves wondering
why companies do not just agree to come clean with their disaggregated data
and have done with it. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Gingrich and embroidery </B><BR>
<BR>
Since this is about as likely as to happen as Mr Newt Gingrich taking up
<I>petit point</I>, it might at least seem reasonable to ask why CI is not
more rigorously policed. Disaggregated data does not aggregate itself spontaneously.
<BR>
<BR>
Cracking down on the balaclava'd middlemen who arrange the involuntary transfer
of data might well provide members of national security services -- masters
at espionage, and with considerable time on their hands since the decease
of the Cold War - with something useful to do. <BR>
<BR>
A recent classified advertisement in <I>The</I> <I>Economist</I> may provide
an answer. Placed by a corporation claiming to &quot;want to be representative
of America&quot;, the ad offers &quot;the Ultimate Overseas Career&quot;
to &quot;candidates with strong interpersonal skills&quot;. These eager
candidates must also be able to demonstrate &quot;a burning interest in
international business&quot;. And is this champion of American free enterprise
General Motors? The Coca-Cola Corporation? Not quite. The advertisement
in question was placed by the Central Intelligence Agency. <p>

<H2>HOW BUSINESS CAN HELP JAPAN </H2>
<H4>BY SOICHIRO TOYODA </H4>
Japan is finally beginning to come to terms with the serious economic issues
that it faces. Economic growth has been less than 1% a year for the past
three years. Personal consumption has been weak and so has capital spending.
Japan's unemployment rate has reached 3.2%, not high by European standards
but in Japan the highest level since records began. Another big problem
is that of bad loans and financial scandals. <BR>
<BR>
These problems have obscured the fundamental strength of the Japanese economy,
so our most pressing job is to reaffirm that strength and to get the economy
growing again. An economically healthier Japan will be a better partner
for Europe, better able to cooperate actively and effectively in pursuing
common interests both with Europe and around the world. <BR>
<BR>
Following pressure from the powerful <I>keidanren</I> industrial associations
and other members of the private sector, the government is taking strong
action. Since 1992 it has pushed through six packages of fiscal stimuli,
including a 45 trillion yen [$44.5 billion]<B> </B>increase in spending
on public works projects. The latest package, announced in September, is
the biggest of its kind ever implemented in Japan. It includes 8 trillion
yen in fiscal measures that will generate real demand within one year and
promises to make a significant contribution to economic recovery. <BR>
<BR>
An economic upturn will get under way gradually this year if the government
implements these fiscal measures fully. Production will increase in some
sectors and capital spending and personal consumption will begin to recover.
This, of course, assumes that the yen does not appreciate again to a ridiculous
level: Japan's recovery would falter if the yen went back to the absurd
level it reached last April. Indeed, the Japanese government cannot solve
the problem alone. The monetary authorities in leading nations must work
together to maintain stable exchange rates. <BR>
<BR>
In the meantime Japan's government and banks are working out a plan for
dealing with the problem of bad loans. They are beginning with measures
for reorganising the so-called <I>Jusen</I> lenders. These are the large
institutions which were supposed to specialise in home loans but which are
now in trouble through unwise lending. Clearly, this crisis needs to be
resolved sooner rather than later or it will only get worse. <BR>
<BR>
We industrialists of the <I>keidanren</I> are in favour of using public
money to help resolve the crisis, but support this measure only to the extent
necessary to protect depositors at failed banks. The banking system has
more than enough liquidity overall to cover bad loans: indeed, if they wished,
some of the bigger banks could write off all their bad loans at once. In
that sense the Daiwa Bank scandal, which notched up trading losses of $1.1
billion<B> </B>last autumn and cast doubt on the stability of all Japanese
banks, happened at an especially bad time. But we must remember that this
scandal had nothing to do with the problem of bad loans. <BR>
<BR>
Japan's banks and financial authorities need to move ahead with concrete
measures to restore confidence in our financial system. There should be
a focus on disclosure and transparency, giving top priority to letting the
market mechanism work. That includes the radical step of making all participants
fully responsible for the consequences of their business and financial decisions.
<BR>
<BR>
These may all be individual issues, but they represent part of a much larger
challenge for Japan. The country must first become a more pleasant place
to live and second a more attractive place for international companies to
do business. Of course Japan is the second biggest economy in the world,
but that growth has not brought a corresponding improvement in Japanese
lifestyle. The country needs a major shift in its economic and social life.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>A vision that encompasses the world </B><BR>
<BR>
At the <I>keidanren</I>, we are drawing up proposals to bring about that
kind of shift. People in the private sector, in academia and in the arts
must work together to shape a more fulfilling social framework, a society
where people in all walks of life can participate freely and actively. <BR>
<BR>
Our vision must encompass the world and the place of Japan in the world
and we must work with the industrialised nations of Europe and North America
to build and maintain a global framework for peace and prosperity. We must
share our skills and resources freely in tackling global issues with those
nations and in supporting sustainable development. To do this Japan needs
to become more open. The biggest obstacle to this is the over-regulation
of the Japanese economy. <BR>
<BR>
As a chairman of <B>a</B> <I>keidanren</I>, I have made deregulation my
highest priority. We cannot revitalise our economy and build a globally
viable nation without drawing fully on the energy of the private sector.
We must tap that energy by clearing away regulations that stand in the way
of healthy private sector activity and we must encourage venture capital
to nurture new industries and markets. Regulation must give way to the free
market and government must give way to the private sector. <BR>
<BR>
Deregulation is the key both to Japan fulfilling its international responsibilities
and to revitalising its economy. It will make Japan more open to foreign
products and investment and will create business opportunities for companies
around the world. <BR>
<BR>
The Japanese government took a step forward in March when it announced a
five-year programme to eliminate or relax regulations on over 1,000 items.
This is already opening up the market and making life easier for Japanese
consumers. It took a further step forward when it accelerated that programme
to take place over three years: under the new timetable, almost two-thirds
of the measures will be in place by the end of this fiscal year. <BR>
<BR>
A relaxation of rules on acquiring cellular telephones, for example, has
led to explosive growth in that market and further deregulation is on the
way. Japan is moving to deregulate domestic airfares which will bring fares
down to levels close to those in other nations. In another sector, the government
will eliminate restrictions on retail price competition in over-the-counter
health products. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Still too many restrictions on market access </B><BR>
<BR>
The present three-year programme is a step forward, but only one step: we
need to review and expand it each year. The present measures do not go nearly
far enough in the finance and agriculture sectors and still leave too many
restrictions on pricing and market access. Those restrictions reflect the
false belief that the state should be responsible for managing the balance
between supply and demand. People in Europe and North America have expressed
their concern that deregulation in Japan could founder in the face of bureaucratic
opposition and a lack of political leadership. They have good cause for
concern but can rest assured that the private sector will do everything
possible to make sure deregulation moves ahead. <BR>
<BR>
That brings me to the issue of Euro-Japanese relations. The EU is the most
advanced in a series of regional economic groupings that have taken shape
in the world. These groupings can help promote free trade and investment,
as long as we all remain committed to multilateral free trade. The EU and
Japan share a strong common interest in strengthening the system of world
trade through the World Trade Organisation and should work together to coordinate
regional initiatives with its larger goals and guidelines. <BR>
<BR>
The US-Japan car industry talks earlier this year reminded me of the importance
of Japan's partnership with Europe. European nations exercised a good influence
on those negotiations, speaking forcefully about the importance of free
trade when the US government threatened unilateral sanctions. We must work
to resolve business issues in the private sector and keep them from becoming
political. <BR>
<BR>
Some of my European friends have suggested that Japan concentrates too much
on the US. I think we will see a better balance in Japan's international
relations as we cultivate closer ties with Europe at the corporate and industry
level. And we can improve that balance still further by promoting equally
vigorous exchanges in non-business sectors such as science, education and
culture. <BR>
<BR>
In all our cooperation, we should be careful to maintain a global perspective.
Reinforcing the WTO framework will depend heavily on promoting free trade
and investment in the Asia Pacific region where countries continue to display
the most dynamic growth in the world, driven by trade and investment among
private companies. It is free and vigorous economic activity that transcends
national borders. <BR>
<BR>
Members of Apec [the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum] reaffirmed
their commitment to free and open trade and investment last October in Osaka.
They drew up a plan for implementing the Bogor Declaration, which aims to
help open markets completely by the year 2010 in the industrialised economies
and by the year 2020 in the developing economies. Apec is a loose regional
grouping led by the private sector, completely open to all nations in all
other regions. Its purpose is to improve the business environment for private-sector
companies and Japan needs to lead the way. The most important consideration
is to translate prosperity and progress in the Asia Pacific region into
progress for the entire world. I hope that Apec members can develop a dialogue
with European nations and the EU's executive Commission. I hope they can
work together on a framework and rules for multilateral trade and investment
in the context of the World Trade Organisation. <p>

<H2>WHY THE WORLD NEEDS UNIONS </H2>
<B>BY BILL JORDAN </B><BR><BR>
The world has changed beyond recognition in the last few years for everyone,
but especially for trade unions and business. In the late '70s two-thirds
of the world's population lived in economies shielded from the risks - and
potential benefits - of international trade and investment. By 2000, the
World Bank estimates that perhaps only a tenth of the world's workers will
be outside the economic mainstream. <BR>
<BR>
This new world economy, undergoing what is sometimes termed globalisation,
has not been kind to ordinary working people. Many have lost their jobs
and the security they enjoyed in the battle for new markets. <BR>
<BR>
How quickly people forget. Everyone remembers the fall of the Berlin Wall
in 1989 and the sense of liberation in Europe which then spread out across
the rest of the world. But few recall the wave of strikes the previous summer
and autumn, when the Polish trade union movement Solidarity re-emerged from
years of repression to lead talks which led to the first genuine elections
in a Soviet bloc country for 50 years. Solidarity has good reason to claim
that its members helped make the world safe for business. <BR>
<BR>
Trade unions have been heading the pressure for change throughout the world,
from Chile to Korea and Romania to Zambia. Yet many feel betrayed, because
their newly elected governments are unable to tackle the huge backlog of
urgent social problems without the approval of a handful of Washington-based
technocrats. Participation in the international economy, with all the conditions
set by the IMF and other institutions, limits the ability of governments
to negotiate with trade unions. <BR>
<BR>
In the wealthier countries, unions face governments that blame the pressures
of international finance for their inability to enter into real dialogue
over key issues like the social security system or public service pay and
jobs. The jargon of convergence criteria, interest and exchange rates and
the public deficit boils down to the fact that finance ministers have become
mere proxies for market sentiment. <BR>
<BR>
Although unions have found it more difficult to make their presence felt,
the problems they pinpoint still remain. The world's new and sometimes triumphalist
economic elite has allowed social and political tensions to fester. Old
and new frustrations are fusing, creating fertile ground for extremist politicians
to launch populist and economically illiterate campaigns. These often include
disturbing racist and xenophobic overtones which undermine both democracy
and international cooperation. <BR>
<BR>
Globalisation is not only changing the relationship between workers and
employers, it has altered the role of the state and transformed the three-way
relations between government, employers and unions. This has forced unions
to look for new ways of bargaining and new ways to influence the labour
market internationally. <BR>
<BR>
However momentous the globalisation process appears, the basic power imbalance
remains. The individual worker is still at a considerable disadvantage to
an employer without the collective support of others through a trade union.
This does not have to be a confrontational process. Many firms accept that
success comes from cooperation between a strong union and imaginative management,
both committed to the long-term prosperity of the business. The basic human
right to join a union and so negotiate a fair return for labour is a foundation
for constructive competition. The purpose of collective bargaining is to
avoid potential conflict and promote sustained cooperation. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Stability needs collective bargaining </B><BR>
<BR>
This positive view is not reported by the media. If world leaders formed
their views about economics and politics from newspapers and television,
they would probably think of trade unions as relics of the pre-globalisation
age. Most media coverage of our work still focuses on the occasional big
strike or protest, as with the recent dispute in France. It is time to reassess
the stereotype and look more deeply at where trade unions fit into the realities
of an interdependent world, driven by intense competition for new markets.
<BR>
<BR>
Some companies recognise that the labour-management power imbalance undermines
the relationship of trust that is essential to the new systems of strategic
planning and organisation. Others deny its importance, fearing either a
dilution of managerial control or the costs of investing in the managerial
practices that a team approach requires. <BR>
<BR>
In a world of liberalised capital markets and tight monetary policies, strong
institutions are vital to the development of the social solidarity that
can counteract growing inequality and insecurity. It is increasingly clear
to trade unions that collective bargaining and wide-ranging tripartite discussions
on economic and social policy are essential components of national and international
efforts to build the stability needed for growth. <BR>
<BR>
Business leaders have a different perspective on these problems. They are
concerned with the survival and profitability of their companies. The technological
revolution has led most companies to rethink how they organise work and
to change old hierarchical and compartmentalised systems in order to meet
the competition. This has spawned a whole new set of management theories
based on ideas such as employee involvement and partnership. For trade unionists
these trends pose a new set of challenges. The classic collective agreement
led to a sharing of responsibilities between unions and management over
basic employment contract issues such as pay, hours of work, holidays and
so on. At the same time, company strategy was left largely in the hands
of management. There were exceptions such as the <I>Mitbestimmung </I>system
in Germany, where representatives have a wider role in company planning,
but in general it was assumed that workers and their unions could not be
trusted with a say in anything beyond the terms of their employment contracts.
<BR>
<BR>
But now the impetus for change is coming from management as interest grows
in new forms of employee involvement. This process is far from accepted
by many workforces which tend to view it as a quick route to the dole queue
because of the legacy of years of mistrust. They fear that gains in productivity
will simply leads to redundancies, now euphemistically called downsizing
or rightsizing. They also see companies spinning off operations to subcontractors,
often in other countries, leaving a small core of winners and a large group
of losers with jobs that are insecure and low-paid. <BR>
<BR>
The main flaw in the thinking of many managers is the tendency to gloss
over the significance of the unequal power relationship on which the contract
of employment between a worker and a company is based. This is bound to
continue unless the relationship is evened up through legal rights and collective
bargaining agreements. <BR>
<BR>
But unions can do more than this. Suspicion needs to be replaced by mutual
respect and trust, otherwise employee involvement will lead to workers acting
merely as agents of feedback, telling managers what they think managers
want to hear. Workers unsure about job security are unlikely to risk telling
managers what is wrong with the way they run the business. Unions can help
remove feelings of insecurity and assure workers that they do not have to
gamble on believing management's promises. Unions can also help workers
see the whole picture of a company's operations and use their expertise
to question it. Such scrutiny tests and strengthens the credibility of management.
<BR>
<BR>
The more that companies involve union representatives in their strategic
thinking, the more they will gain from employee involvement. If you doubt
it, look at some of the world's most successful unionised companies. This
approach has gained some acceptance in the EU, where European Works Councils
establish consultation structures for the ever-growing number of companies
with transnational operations. These new councils have the potential to
promote cross-fertilisation of ideas across national boundaries and encourage
a much-needed reassessment within the many companies still suffering from
them-and-us attitudes. There is no need to limit the strategy to Europe.
<BR>
<BR>
But companies can go further by accepting that they do not operate in a
vacuum and that they are part of a wider community. Quality products do
not emerge from low-quality communities. At the local level, employers'
organisations should get their members involved in efforts to improve the
environment, strengthen local schools and health care and other such goals.
This is not charity work but an investment which should be planned as such.
Unions can help companies get a good return on such investments. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sound industrial relations make deregulation easier </B><BR>
<BR>
The challenge for trade unions in the era of trade globalisation is to ensure
that necessary and rapid changes in the nature of work and the labour market
are achieved without compromising full employment and social justice. We
have to convince governments that it is essential to act urgently to increase
the size and spread of world economic growth. <BR>
<BR>
The wholesale deregulation of labour markets increases the problems countries
face in adapting to change. Problems are solved where governments, trade
unions and employers focus together on strengthening labour market institutions,
so that people can benefit from training and job-creation schemes. We know,
but must convince others, that sound industrial relations and a well-functioning
tripartite consultation system are the best means of ensuring that the labour
market responds to change with the least social dislocation. They are also
the best means of making tough choices about the distribution of scarce
resources without destabilising government budgets and within the restraints
of global competitive pressures. <BR>
<BR>
The more optimistic advocates of market liberalisation foresee a new golden
age of rapid growth which will spread prosperity all over the world. The
reality for many millions of working people is very different. Trade unions
have a duty to warn world leaders that they risk blinding themselves with
their own rhetoric to the unemployment, poverty and social dislocation that
are the unfortunate underside of globalisation. <BR>
<BR>
We also have a responsibility to attempt to work with employers and governments
and achieve a new balance between competition and social cohesion. If we
are to play that role, the attitude of hostility to unions that became fashionable
in the '80s must change - the sooner this happens, the better for all of
us. <p>

<H2>THE ALTRUISM INDEX </H2>
<H4>The first World Link survey of politicians' pay around the world shows
some startling disparities. Paul Martin explains what they mean for public
service </H4>
Singapore's prime minister earns 56 times more than the average manufacturing
employee in his country and twice as much as the average chief executive.
Translated into US terms, this would mean President Bill Clinton's salary
rising from its current $200,000 to $1.8 million. In America such a large
salary would prompt an outcry: in Singapore it is seen as a vital defence
against corruption. <BR>
<BR>
To add spice to the Davos summit, which attracts political figures from
around the globe,<I> World Link</I> has attempted to measure politicians'
pay as a reflection of how they are valued. The answer depends, as so often,
on the assumptions societies have about public service. Should politicians,
as public servants, earn roughly the same as the people they represent?
Or, given that they are also our country's leaders, do we want the best
that money can buy? To put it more bluntly: is politics a vocation or a
profession? <BR>
<BR>
The main argument for giving politicians competitive salaries is that voters
get what they pay for. Singapore is famous for a deliberate policy of high
pay, indexing salaries against the highest in the private sector to innoculate
itself against the corruption which pervades some countries in the region
and to ensure that the government continues to attract the country's brightest
and best. Singapore worries that a failure to do so could result in the
loss of its competitive edge, according to the government report <I>Competitive
Salaries for Competent and Honest Government </I>published in the autumn
of 1994. &quot;Competent political leadership is crucial to good government.
Singapore must draw its ministers from among its most outstanding and committed
citizens,&quot; it wrote. <BR>
<BR>
Richard Grant, head of the Asia-Pacific programme at the Royal Institute
of International Affairs (RIIA) in London, describes this as &quot;a reflection
of the value Singaporeans put in their officials&quot;. At least this value
has been appreciated by outsiders: the city state came third in the corruption
index recently published by Transparency International and the University
of G&ouml;ttingen and consistently heads the government ranking in the World
Economic Forum's <I>World Competitiveness Report</I>. The World Bank has
written that Singapore is &quot;widely perceived to have the region's most
competent and upright bureaucracy&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Creating a culture hostile to corruption </B><BR>
<BR>
But there is more to beating corruption than paying well. Japan's prime
minister, the highest paid public official outside Singapore in our survey,
presides over a political system that is creaking under the weight of corruption
scandals which reach right to the very heart of the government. Japan ranks
fourth in the <I>World Competitiveness Report</I> overall, but 27th in the
government factor. On the other hand Italy, which emerges as far more egalitarian
in our survey, is equally riven by allegations of financial impropriety.
The RIIA's Grant says that in Singapore the whole culture now mitigates
against corruption, but suggests that money is less a cause than a symptom.
&quot;I don't think the prime minister of Singapore would be corrupt even
if he made $15,000.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Wolfgang Glage, vice-president at pay consultants Towers Perrin and the
author of its recent<I> Worldwide Total Remuneration Survey</I>, says he
finds it disappointing that counties like Britain pay public officials so
little, because the government &quot;cannot compete in the marketplace for
talent&quot;. Politicians would no doubt concur, and in fact variations
on this theme have been used to justify highly paid appointments to senior
public posts around the world. <BR>
<BR>
But no country can now afford, fiscally or politically, to raise government
pay to Singaporean-style multiples. Shareholders often complain about excessive
pay raises in the private sector, but particular venom is reserved for western
politicians whose pay rises are seen as a betrayal of trust by tax-paying
voters. Rosa Wilkinson of the Office of Manpower Economics in London points
out that the British press reacted with outrage when members of parliament
voted themselves a 2.7% rise from January 1, 1996, even though this was
likely to be less generous than the final increase awarded in the rest of
the public sector. <BR>
<BR>
Politicians face another unique problem. It is difficult to convince others
of the need for sacrifice and budgetary discipline when you are voting yourself
a rise. Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe invited the attention of the
world's press when his salary jumped 130% to Z$456,000 ($48,582) in November.
Civil servants were especially indignant - they had sued the government
only the week before for cancelling their end-of-year bonus. Indeed, taxpayers
in most countries would prefer to see their politicians follow the South
African example and take a pay cut. However, it should be remembered that
Nelson Mandela's new salary of R552,000 ($150,766), down 20% from R690,000,
is still 11 times higher than that of a South African industrial worker
and higher than those of the prime ministers of France, Britain or Canada.
<BR>
<BR>
The alternative, if governments wish to attract talent from the private
sector, is either to allow public officials to put their private sector
interests on hold while they serve, or to allow them to make use of what
is called the revolving door by capitalising on their contacts when they
leave public service. Neither option is free of political risk. The debate
over former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's media interests highlighted
the conflict of interest problems inherent in the first tactic, especially
since maverick millionaires seem to be a growing feature of politics everywhere.
<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, former British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd raised
hackles when he joined the board of National Westminster Bank and became
deputy chairman of their merchant banking arm barely three months after
he had left the Foreign Office. Claiming that he moved with undue haste,
the opposition Labour Party made the most of the situation: &quot;You don't
fix up a directorship like that overnight,&quot; one spokesman said. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, heads of state receive non-cash benefits that are not easily
quantifiable. Politicians, at least in a democracy, cannot count on receiving
long-term incentives such as share options but very few private sector pay
packets include an allowance for a palace and a limousine. Official accommodation
is worth at least 20% of the cash value of the salary and more in some European
or Asian capitals, according to Towers Perrin's Glage. Other benefits, such
as free travel or upgrades, pensions, health plans and so on, also make
public sector pay more attractive than it may at first seem. <BR>
<BR>
All the same, the feeling remains that as well as sacrificing their right
to privacy, their personal safety, and in some cases their principles to
get elected, politicians are asked to sacrifice their financial security
as well. Some people regard this as a fair price. The Nolan Committee, in
its first report on standards in British public life last autumn, dubbed
selflessness one of the seven principles of public life. Holders of public
office &quot;should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest...
not to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family
or their friends&quot;, it said. Indeed, our use of the term &quot;public
service&quot; implies that it is motivated by a degree of altruism: hence
the Altruism Index. <BR>
<BR>
The index compares the official salary paid to a political chief executive
(the president in the US, the chancellor in Germany, the prime minister
in Italy) with the average total remuneration paid to manufacturing employees
in his or her country. It does not take into account earnings from outside
interests, either legal or illegal, nor does it fully or equally account
for all the non-cash benefits of office such as free travel or accommodation.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The price of good politics </B><BR>
<BR>
Finally, it is notoriously difficult to compare private and public sector
pay, mostly because of the problem of non-cash remuneration. The results,
therefore, should be treated with caution. They are not intended to be a
measure of greed or even relative wealth. Rather, they indicate the position
of politicians in different societies by showing the premium taxpayers are
willing to offer for representing them. <BR>
<BR>
As might be expected, countries with large income differentials in the wider
economy such as South Africa or Hungary rank low on the altruism index.
The figure for the US, which one might expect to fit into that category,
is deceptive because although the president earns only about six times as
much as a manufacturing employee, he also earns far less (just a quarter)
than the average chief executive's pay. Countries where there is a strong
tradition of government leadership in the economy, such as Japan and Germany,
also score highly. In both, the head of government earns about eight times
the salary of a manufacturing worker and about 80% of a private sector chief's
salary. Egalitarian societies such as Canada or Sweden are near the foot
of the table, which just serves to confirm that their notion of public service
has financial as well as ethical implications. <BR>
<BR>
When one moves beyond the executive branch of government, real differences
in political culture emerge. Swiss legislators or national councillors are
arguably the most altruistic: they all have full-time jobs but receive an
allowance of SFR55,000 ($63,800), roughly equal to the average industrial
wage, to meet four times a year, each time for a period of three weeks.
Their allowance - a 1992 referendum voted against making it a salary - has
to cover all the expenses associated with their public role except postage.
Italian deputies, on the other hand, receive six times the average manufacturing
wage - the same multiple as the US president - as well as research and secretarial
staff provided by their political parties. Poland's Sejm has both part-time
and full-time deputies with the latter paid three times as much as the former.
<BR>
<BR>
In Britain, the Nolan Committee report concluded that British members of
parliament should continue to earn money from other sources and parliament
&quot;would be less effective if all MPs were full-time professional politicians&quot;.
It estimated that 30% of British MPs hold paid outside consultancies. In
contrast, members of the US House of Representatives, while technically
permitted to earn up to 40% of the value of their salary from sources outside
the house, seldom do so: the current speaker, Newt Gingrich, is a notable
exception. They are all full-time professional politicians and are paid
twice as much as their British counterparts to compensate. Members of the
senate, who are paid just as well, are much more likely to add to their
income from outside earnings, according to a survey conducted by the Review
Body on Senior Salaries in London. Members of both houses of congress are
also entitled to funds for research and secretarial staff which dwarf those
allocated to their British counterparts: a maximum of over $1.8 million
for a senator compared to just $60,000 for an MP. <BR>
<BR>
Where legislators are only semi-professional, as in Britain, Sweden and
especially Switzerland, civil servants seem to be the primary beneficiaries.
In most other cases, civil servants earn about as much as elected representatives.
However, while it is becoming more and more popular to peg civil service
pay to changes in the private sector, the mandarins are also increasingly
likely to be judged by private sector standards. Performance-related pay,
for example, in places like Japan, Sweden and Denmark can increase salaries
by up to 20%. If this were applied to politicians, one pay consultant told
us, &quot;they would probably end up owing us money&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
The point which emerges most strongly is that of Glage from Towers Perrin
who says most politicians of ability are either idealists or independently
wealthy. &quot;It is the exception rather than the rule,&quot; he says,
&quot;that we attract the right people.&quot; Or as one executive ruefully
confides, &quot;I have a wife and two kids. I would love to be in politics,
but I can't afford it.&quot;<HR>The chart compares the cash compensation
paid to senior public officials and average pay for a manufacturing employee
in that country. It also includes the country's rankings in the World Economic
Forum's World Competitiveness Report, both overall and in the good government
index. The Altruism Index is simply the salary of the political chief executive
divided by that of the manufacturing employee. The lower the figure, the
higher the amount of altruism - or alternative sources of income - needed
to hold public office. <BR>

<td valign=top align=left><H2>LIFE AFTER HISTORY </H2>
<H4>The market does not have all the answers, after all. Provocative analyst
Francis Fukuyama tells Susan Greenberg why culture has such an important,
but intangible, effect on our prosperity</H4>
The Rand Corporation's Washington office is a surprisingly no-fuss place,
more like the cramped corridors of a university than a prestigious policy
think-tank. Rand senior researcher Francis Fukuyama is also deceptively
unassuming: his first book <I>The end of history and the Last Man</I> caused
a small uproar several years ago and the latest one, <I>Trust: The social
virtues and the creation of prosperity,</I> shows a similar ability to tap
popular concerns. <BR>
<BR>
Fukuyama was criticised as triumphalist in <I>The end of history</I> for
arguing that history as defined by Hegel and Marx had &quot;ended&quot;
with the Cold War: the difference was that it had ended not with proletarian
revolution but the triumph of liberal democracy and the market economy.
In <I>Trust</I> he tackles some of the doubts surrounding this system and
makes the case for the importance of &quot;inherited ethical habit&quot;
to economic well-being, arguing that the cultural characteristic of trust
gives rise to &quot;social capital&quot;, a measure of people's ability
to work together for a common purpose. <BR>
<BR>
Fukuyama met <I>World Link</I> in Washington to explore these themes, which
are of core interest to many of our readers. <BR>
<BR>
<I>You have complained of misunderstandings over your first book: have any
major problems arisen over the new one?</I> <BR>
<BR>
The biggest problem is that people misunderstand the purpose of the argument.
James Fallows of <I>Atlantic Monthly</I> was typical: he said I was presenting
an alternative macroeconomic growth model [even though] economists understand
the sources of growth and they are not cultural. I never made that claim:
I am not trying to attack the whole foundation of modern economics. I think
that foundation is secure, the existing growth models are quite accurate
and the policy prescriptions are ones I am generally sympathetic with. But
even by the assumptions of modern neoclassical economics the models only
account for up to 70% of observed growth in the world, so there's a very
important residual... which cannot be explained by them. To get into this
residual you need cultural explanations, you cannot develop theories that
are empirically verifiable to the same degree. <BR>
<BR>
This is the meaning of the end of history. We understand the big principles
about how to organise a modern society: you can make adjustments but the
essence - a liberal democracy and regulated markets - is not up for grabs
any longer. This means that interest shifts from those big factors to the
residual ones, and that's where social capital is important. <BR>
<BR>
The second common mistake is when people say there is no point to my theory
because the figures show low-trust countries can grow as fast as high-trust
ones. I have said explicitly that trust is not an important factor as a
predictor of GDP aggregate growth: what it does is help us understand the
global division of labour, for example why the state needs to step in to
create large organisations in low-trust societies like France, where the
private sector is not capable of doing so. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Does the latest crisis in Paris illustrate your book's point about the
gulf in France between the ruler and ruled?</I> <BR>
<BR>
French democracy has always been defective, and you can see why in the latest
crisis. Here in Washington, the government shut down because there was a
deadlock over the budget. In France, the government is able to decree an
austerity package much stiffer than the American one: there is no discussion
in the legislature, they just spring it on everyone. The result is that
everyone asks, &quot;What about us, the people that elected you?&quot; It
is not a new insight... that throughout French history there has been an
alternation between the two extremes [of hyper-centralised and excessively
decentralised authority]. <BR>
<BR>
<I>I was interested in the book's link between a strong emphasis on family
business and corruption, as seen in Chinese societies and Italy.</I> <BR>
<BR>
I have been rung up by quite a few Italian journalists. I expected hostility
but they say the book gives an accurate description of politics in Italy,
where there's a high degree of corruption due to a low sense of public morality
outside the family: economic success depends on the family business and
everything else is run by the state. This is also the pattern throughout
Latin America. There are two separate sets of moral rules, one for the family
and one for street, and the standards for the street are considerably lower.
If you get elected to public office, to some extent your first moral obligation
is to steal on behalf of your family. <BR>
<BR>
<I>The theory may also apply in eastern Europe, where there was a saying
that if you did not steal from the state you were stealing from your family.
People there also tend to be more passive in the public domain.</I> <BR>
<BR>
The future of many of those former communist countries, including Russia,
is going to look more like Italy than any other model: a weak and ineffective
state and poorly organised civil society, a lurching back and forth between
unstable governments and attempts to impose order, and in the meantime the
growth of criminal gangs. <BR>
<BR>
I have proposed a study of the former communist world parallel to my book,
because I think cultural factors explain many transition trajectories. Totalitarianism
was supposed to homogenise those societies but they are all different. The
most successful were those like Lithuania which produced fairly deep non-communist
leaderships right away, people who just came out of the woodwork. There
were people with similar social backgrounds in Ukraine as well and yet none
took part in political life there after communism. <BR>
<BR>
In the Baltics, for example, hatred of the Russians is at least as deep
as ethnic hatreds in the Balkans and yet not a drop of blood was spilt in
that transition. When you ask why, people cite northern Europe culture.
That's obviously true but it is not clear by which mechanism such a culture
was transmitted over the generations: the nobility was non-indiginous and
local people were all peasants a few generations ago. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Doesn't that also highlight the inadequacy of explanations about Balkan
conflict being based on &quot;centuries-old rivalries&quot;? </I><BR>
<BR>
Especially when these centuries-old rivalries tend to be quiescent for centuries!
Then suddenly they flare up and people say, &quot;Oh yes, it's that centuries-old
rivalry&quot;. They said a lot of ridiculous stuff about the Iran-Iraq war:
it was the old Sunni-Shia rivalry or Arab-Persian rivalry. <BR>
<BR>
<I>In The end of history you say liberal democracy and capitalism has &quot;won&quot;
but it is coming under intense question at home. There may not be a clearly
articulated alternative yet but the current confusion may be part of a new,
still-hidden process. As Alan Bloom comments in The closing of the American
mind, economics deals only with the bourgeois who fears violent death while
humans are perverse and do not always wish to be comfortable.</I> <BR>
<BR>
There is obviously a lot of unhappiness in the democratic world... but nobody
questions the basic foundations of the liberal solution, or tinkers with
economic nationalism or socialism as an alternative. The problem is mainly
at a sub-institutional level, to do with cultural questions of identity.
In my view the capitalist marketplace substitutes for those older forms
of struggle in many ways but... the problem with the Last Man [identified
by the philosopher Friedrich Nietsche] is that people [get to the point
where they] do not want rational consumption. But again, I don't think that's
the problem with the Balkans: it is not as if they had rational consumption
and got bored with it, as if they decided to tear it all up and have some
excitement. <BR>
<BR>
There is a long-term theoretical incoherence about liberalism. The American
system is based on the idea of inalienable rights, which Jefferson declares
are &quot;self-evident&quot;. But no serious modern philosopher would consider
them self-evident today because the 20th century tradition of relativism
categories them as specific cultural traditions rather than a statement
about humanity as such. You can see this in the fight with the Singaporean
leader Lee Kuan Yew over human rights in Asia. <BR>
<BR>
<I>The book appears to be arguing in two directions. One is towards the
fears within US society that lead western businessmen, for example, to praise
authoritarian societies abroad. The other is to non-westerners defending
those societies who crow, &quot;we are doing better than you&quot;. </I><BR>
<BR>
Yes, there is a fundamental misunderstanding. It can be right that democracy
is superior as a universal system of governing for modern society but it
can also be right that there are aspects of society in Singapore, for example,
which are superior to the US. I think the big disservice Lee Kuan Yew has
done is that he links the big institutions to social decay and says: &quot;All
America's urban problems are due to democracy <I>per se</I>, if you want
to avoid them you need an authoritarian system like ours.&quot; I think
that's just nonsense. <BR>
<BR>
The basic argument in <I>Trust</I> is that the big institutions have to
be supplemented by a moral framework and a set of pre-modern values to make
them work. If you go back to Alexis De Tocqueville [who wrote the classic
<I>Democracy in America</I> in the republic's early years] he understood
very well that you cannot create a liveable society based simply on the
self-interested interactions of individuals. My book makes a parallel argument
in the economic sphere: markets do not work without some kind of moral structure.
Modern institutions have to coexist with traditional forms of moral behaviour,
reciprocity and trust. <BR>
<BR>
The businessman that admires Singapore sees the social discipline and authoritarianism
and assumes the two are necessarily interconnected. Although many difficulties
in the US stem from the nature of its democracy, it is not by any means
a necessary outgrowth. Just take the difference between the US and Europe
in the way rights are interpreted, which accounts for a lot of our problems.
<BR>
<BR>
Every European democracy that enumerates a set of individual rights also
enumerates duties to the community and none of the rights is interpreted
absolutely. In that sense the American Bill of Rights is unique in that
it does not enumerate any positive duties to the community. You sees this
in constitutional law, in attitudes towards pornography or gun control.
The right to own a gun is seen as such an absolute right that people favouring
it think the most modest abridgement means the end of the right as a whole.
Similarly, it seems to me you can control pornography and still have freedom
of speech, but the way the civil libertarians talk you'll be banning James
Joyce if you ban an X-rated movie. <BR>
<BR>
Many US problems have to do with a specific history surrounding race. The
civil rights movement of the '60s brought about many necessary changes but
set a pattern for all subsequent activism which has not been helpful. There
were always two patterns for upward mobility in the US: the one used by
Jews and Asians was mobility through the economic system, self-employment,
education and so on. The other was pioneered by the Irish but used by the
blacks, to capture political power and use it to pull yourself up. The Irish
did it through the local political machine, the blacks through the courts
which are more powerful than in Europe. The latter were very successful
and every subsequent group with a grievance has taken the rights approach
as a model. <BR>
<BR>
In the '60s there was a campaign to get rid of the corrupt Tammany Halls.
The problem is that after you destroy the local machines people used in
their climb to the top it all became federalised, either by the courts or
in anti-poverty programmes. <BR>
<BR>
The Hispanic community is an interesting case, because culturally it is
not that different from the southern Italians who flooded in at the turn
of the century and who relied on self-help rather than the courts. All the
Mexicans coming in now could follow that pattern, except that their political
leadership has this post-civil rights strategy. <BR>
<BR>
<I>The book argues against multicultural extremism and says America should
continue to impose a set of core values if it is to avoid legislating for
every aspect of life. What kind of reaction has there been to this theme?
</I><BR>
<BR>
In this country we are getting to a point where people are beginning to
see that the path towards multiculturalism and ethnic balkanisation has
gone too far and needs to be cut short to some degree. The cultural revolution
of the '60s took at least a generation to happen, and like all revolutions
is producing a counter-revolution which will take at least another generation.
That generation is not going to set things back to the way they were in
1963 - we will get some kind of uneasy synthesis - but I think the shift
is going to happen and in the same way, [as] a movement sparked by what
people think about their parents, the government... <BR>
<BR>
The reason I am guardedly optimistic is that for a great many ethnic groups
in the US the assimilationist engine is still working pretty well. Asians
are now 6% of the population. Hispanic groups want to learn English and
become Americans for traditional reasons: the rate of intermarriage is so
high that the whole category may disappear, just as it is hard to separate
Germans or Swedes. The most problematic group has been that of African-Americans
where assimilation has not worked as hoped and is going backwards at a fairly
rapid pace, but it is possible that this may be cautionary message to other
groups. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Your book aims to be even-handed, but I had the impression you put more
emphasis on attacking the US left's civil rights mentality than on the new
threat from the far right. </I><BR>
<BR>
I think criticism of the civil rights revolution is not just criticism of
the left. One interesting development in this country is the way the rights
culture has migrated from left to right. In the '60s the right liked authority,
the FBI and the Pentagon: it was the left which had all these lunatic conspiracy
theories. Now it is the [anti-federal] militia people who have conspiracy
theories about the FBI and so on. Even the way people dress - earrings and
ponytails, once the exclusive province of the left in the '60s - has migrated.
There always was this anti-statist extremism that goes back to the founding
of the country: what is new is a willingness to entertain elaborate conspiracy
theories. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Are mainstream conservative politicians failing to draw a line between
&quot;small government&quot; and the paranoia of more extremist groups?
After all, the federal government is one expression of working for the common
good, which you consider so vital.</I> <BR>
<BR>
I agree people go overboard in their anti-statism. There are things only
states can do, like enforcing security and property rights. We have gone
through periods like this before: the pendulum will swing the other way.
For example, radical proposals to deregulate the banks were put on hold
by the Daiwa scandal. <BR>
<BR>
There is a deeper argument that you need to draw a line between the state
and civil society, that there is a common good but various ways of reaching
that common good. Smarter Republicans like [House speaker] Newt Gingrich
and William Kristol see this quite clearly. They would argue that the state
can injure the ability of people to work together for common ends and want
to cut back the role of the state, not so that the individual has maximum
freedom - they are not libertarians in that sense - but so that they can
give back to civil society what should be in its own province. <BR>
<BR>
The problem is that they only have half the formula. They got the cutting-back-of-the-state
part of it, but there is really no guarantee that civil society will simply
spontaneously spring back into the vacuum. You can see that most clearly
in welfare reform. There's no question that the AFDC (Aid to Families with
Dependent Children) programme has undermined the family in poor neighbourhoods.
It was designed during the '30s depression to help widows over a transition
period, but became a major source of support for single teenage mothers
and had a major destabilising role [providing a work disincentive]. Congress
has voted to abolish it, but abolishing that bad incentive does not recreate
the family when you've had a couple of generations of men who do not know
what it is to be a father. <BR>
<BR>
<I>You say the market is not enough. Yet in Britain, anyone who takes this
line is usually labelled left-wing and it was former Conservative leader
Margaret Thatcher who said there was no such thing as society</I> <BR>
<BR>
In the US there is a difference between Gingrich and [former President Ronald]
Reagan, the counterpart of Thatcher, who never articulated the civil society
argument. In this post-Reagan generation you really do have a realisation,
at least among certain conservatives, that there is a layer of society in-between
[the family and state]. Besides Gingrich, William Bennett argues that a
sense of civic duty is necessary for the functioning of society but he continues
to be anti-statist. <BR>
<BR>
<I>The debate about trust moved into management theory even before your
book appeared. Does such an approach work, since it is not often reciprocal?</I>
<BR>
<BR>
It's funny, because management theorists were much more sympathetic to my
book than the economists. There is a very broad move from low-trust to high-trust
organisations across the board, from hierarchical to flat organisations.
When you flatten an organisation you devolve authority to the bottom and
you need to trust people there to take responsibilities and use their judgement.
Historically, this is a good way of dealing with uncertainty and lack of
information, which usually exists at the bottom level and which gets lost
if it has to make a two-way trip up and down the hierarchy. <BR>
<BR>
There are a couple of problems with this. It is not going to work if people
at the bottom are not given the wherewithal to assume these greater responsibilities,
such as training, but that component is often missing. In Germany, the other
part of the package is to do with job security. That's where the real problem
lies in the US flat revolution. Many companies here reorganise and then
fire half their workers, leaving the remaining workforce demoralised and
distrustful. The last thing people are going to do is use their initiative
if they've just seen half their co-workers laid off. <BR>
<BR>
Both the Germans and Japanese have lifetime employment systems but it is
not as rigid as you would think. The company, knowing it cannot just lay
off people, takes responsibility for retraining. If you're a manager and
your labour is a fixed cost, it is in your interest to make it able to generate
value. It does not work in the US because if one company started retraining
its workers, others could poach them. In Germany everyone pays into the
training kitty and in Japan there is social ostracism for jumping ship.
<BR>
<BR>
<I>The term &quot;end of history&quot; became widely used but also widely
criticised. Do you have any regrets about it?</I> <BR>
<BR>
I regret the fact that it was so widely misunderstood. After the fuss over
my original article I thought I would write a longer book to explain this
concept of history [which has] a very precise meaning if you're Hegelian.
But it did not do any good, because people just could not get past their
initial impression. It's funny because the most sympathetic readers of the
book were all Marxists: the <I>New Left Review</I> did a long series of
essays by British Marxists who were critical but good because they did not
have this hang-up over the word history. <BR>
<BR>
<I>The strongest negative reaction came from people familiar with eastern
Europe, where history was being unfrozen. The end of the Cold War resolved
some things but made others more uncertain. Did you take that into account?</I>
<BR>
<BR>
Nothing that's happened in eastern Europe has run contrary to the basic
idea of the end of history. What happened in that part of the world would
falsify the hypothesis only if what you were doing is constructing a genuinely
new system that had never existed before. <BR>
<BR>
I do not see that happening. I see a lot of troubled societies having a
hard time, stuck between an old and new set of institutions. But that is
a troubled transition, that is not the same thing as restarting history.

<H2>SPEED BUMPS </H2>
<H3>A WEEK IN THE LIFE OF A VW PRODUCTIVITY WORKSHOP </H3>
<H4>In its bid to boost productivity, VW is inviting workers to bare their
souls. Adrian Murdoch sits in on a session at Wolfsburg </H4>
&quot;To rank as world class, European manufacturers need to double productivity&quot;:
that is the brutal conclusion of the Economist Intelligence Unit in its
survey of the European motor business. Since the onslaught of the Japanese
in the '80s, European car manufacturers have been fighting a rearguard battle
against competitors who have made more cars than them, of better quality
and with more choice. <BR>
<BR>
Between 1982 and 1990 alone, Japanese car manufacturers doubled their product
portfolio. Over the same period European manufacturers actually reduced
their portfolio and the results have been felt on the bottom line with declining
profits and market share. The impact is intensified by the growing trend
to source and produce globally. <BR>
<BR>
The country hardest hit is Germany and the company that is having the most
difficulty adjusting to the new world order is Volkswagen. Admired throughout
the '50s and '60s, the Beetle became the world's best-selling car in the
early '70s as the company produced high-quality compact cars at a price
that everyone could afford. At the same time its workers' high wages and
long holidays were envied as Volkswagen proved year after year that its
social capitalism could produce high profits. <BR>
<BR>
In the harsh climate of the '90s, however, the Volkswagen engine has not
been turning over quite as it should. The company's market share in Europe
has slipped to 10.2% and although net profits in the first half of last
year - DM113 million ($78.2 million) - reversed the DM209 million loss it
had suffered the year before, the company is due for a full service. <BR>
<BR>
The VW engine has begun to stall for two important reasons. The first is
a general manufacturing problem in Germany. Wages account for 70% of the
cost of building a car and German workers are the most expensive in Europe
with an average industrial wage of $31.08 per hour, almost half of that
made up by social costs. This makes them twice as expensive as British workers,
for example (figure 1). <BR>
<BR>
The second problem has to do with VW's unwillingness and inability to reduce
the workforce. As the effects of the recession began to be felt in the early
'90s, VW introduced a four-day week in 1993 as a means of saving jobs and
maintaining its paternal image, following chairman Ferdinand Pi&euml;ch's
threat that 30,000 jobs would have to go. What was effectively a job-sharing
arrangement was briefly touted as a new paradigm for a caring decade. The
regional government of Lower Saxony, which holds a 20% stake in the company,
was happy with this solution because it kept unemployment figures down just
before the elections. The company management was happy because it had avoided
redundancy payments and bad public relations. The powerful union IG Metall,
which has a seat on the supervisory board, was happy because it could feel
it had looked after the rights of its members. <BR>
<BR>
The four-day week helped secure around 25,000 jobs but was still of limited
help in improving VW's competitive position, trying to squeeze flexibility
into a rigid system. Quite how limited was seen during last September's
pay negotiations between VW and IG Metall. After walkouts that cost the
company DM300 million in lost production, VW effectively won on many of
the issues with one crucial rider: no workers were to be fired for the next
two years. In other words it is still employing more people than it needs
and natural wastage alone will not transform the situation. This combination
of factors has conspired to make Wolfsburg, VW's flagship factory in the
central Germany state of Lower Saxony, one of the most inefficient auto
plants in the world. It produces only 40% of the number of cars per employee
as General Motors/Opel does in its state-of-the-art factory in the east
German town of Eisenach and only 18% as many as Toyota at its Takaoka plant
(figure 2). &quot;Wolfsburg is a plant where the size itself is a problem,&quot;
admits Willem Admiraal, head of the productivity centre at Wolfsburg, whose
brief it is to stop the rot. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Volkswagen was a very successful company until two, three years ago
and people there have a deep-seated mentality that the way we have always
done things is the right way... They have been so successful for the last
30-40 years that they ask, why change a winning team?&quot; he says. &quot;They
are right, they did incredible things... but there are [also] things we
need to change.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The productivity team has been busy, working out how to produce more cars
with the same number of workers or the same number of cars with fewer workers.
The auto industry became aware of the potential of this approach in the
early '90s when Jos&eacute; Ignacio Lopez, then General Motors' vice-president
of purchasing, touted efficiency gains of between 50% and 150% through productivity
workshops. Admiraal, son-in-law of Lopez and another refugee from GM, is
clear on his definition of productivity. &quot;It is not a guy sweating
away, coming home and collapsing into a chair because he is so tired. That
is not productivity, that is killing your people. We can only reach productivity
by eliminating waste... improving quality and productivity at the same time.
That is the only way to go forward.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Employees have the answers </B><BR>
<BR>
A new five-day workshop was introduced in which GM and its suppliers jointly
decided what changes were needed. Picos or Purchased Input Concept Optimisation
with Suppliers, as it was first called, aimed to help suppliers eliminate
waste and meet customer satisfaction goals, focusing on three key areas
- quality, service and price. <BR>
<BR>
In April 1993 Volkswagen introduced Lopez and KVP2 - the <I>Kontinuierlicher
Verbesserungs Proze&szlig; quadrat</I> or Continuous Improvement Process
squared. Then as now, the objective of a workshop was to develop manufacturing
that was focused on the customer rather than on production by asking the
one group of people who knew many of the answers - the employees. In other
words, the aim was to focus on the tiny, incremental improvements which
add up to productivity and break down existing barriers between workers
and management, be-tween different departments and between the producer
and its suppliers. This means, among other things, adding value to operations,
eliminating the root cause of defects, eliminating inventory and using just-in-time
production, letting information flow and emphasising teamwork and good relations
with employees. <BR>
<BR>
From tentative beginnings at VW's Salzgitter factory and at Audi, by the
end of 1993 some 16,000 workers had taken part in 2,000 workshops. By the
end of 1994, 60,000 workers had taken part in 6,300 workshops. In its first
year alone, Lopez claimed an across-the-board productivity increase of 20%,
others in the company and industry are more cautious. <BR>
<BR>
<I>World Link</I> was invited to observe one of these workshops in the seat
production department, to see at first-hand the challenges a company faces
in putting productivity into practice. In the comfort of an office it is
easy to see productivity merely as a strategic issue, but as the workshop
shows, it often comes down to apparently minor incremental improvements
which can be very difficult to achieve. <BR>
<BR>
Stepping off the train at Wolfsburg, the first thing you see are the four
smokestacks of a VW power plant and the company's massive blue and white
logo. Wolfsburg is one of the last great company towns in Europe and VW
dominates the 150,000 people who live there in a way rarely seen today:
not even Mercedes' star shines as brightly in Stuttgart. To drive any other
car than a VW is regarded as bad manners. <BR>
<BR>
Four-day workshops run throughout the year, with the theme announced a week
beforehand. An effort is made to include someone from every shift, to get
ideas across to as many people as possible, but KVP2 cannot force people
to come. Melanie Cain, moderator of the KVP2 workshop, admits that it has
been difficult at times getting people to come, partly because staff &quot;think
it is a way of getting rid of people&quot;. The workshop itself can confirm
their worst fears: a poster on the workshop wall asks, &quot;Why are we
doing KVP2? To secure our jobs&quot;. But participants are won over on learning
that 90% of suggestions made during the workshop are implemented, eventually.
<BR>
<BR>
Although trust is increasing there is a longer-term problem for the moderators
themselves: they exist because of the will of Pi&euml;ch and Lopez. More
than two years on from the launch of the workshops there is still no official
structure for these people, who are picked from the production line and
thrown into the job after only a week's intensive training, no official
job description and, say some, no real recognition given the essential but
unquantifiable soft skills that moderators need. As Uwe Bothe of KVP2 administration
says, they are &quot;not moderators in the classic sense: they lead the
questions [and] are responsible for the results&quot;. Cain is sanguine
but is still doing exams in her spare time which will qualify her as foreman.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>VW needs to make a quantum leap </B><BR>
<BR>
The group from the seat production department met on Monday morning, at
7.30 sharp, in Halle 8 where the Polo is assembled. The Polo has been one
of VW's most successful models: bought by 3.8 million people over 19 years
of production, it now accounts for 28% of total sales. The luxurious and
prize-winning third-generation Polo was unveiled in Paris in August 1994
and VW hopes to produce around 350,000 cars annually. But with current delivery
times as long as 12 weeks, there is clearly much that can be done. <BR>
<BR>
Moderator Cain is chairing the sessions with Roman Delau from the industrial
engineering department. Participants include four people from the shopfloor:
Peter, a foreman who plays peacemaker in many of the week's arguments; Stefan
and Henrik, both frustrated at not having a voice and Maik, a union representative
who has been on workshops before and is sceptical about the changes promised.
<BR>
<BR>
The session starts with a presentation on the car industry and the aims
of KVP2. Delau outlines the world's current annual overcapacity of 10.4
million cars: VW must ensure that its own cars are the ones that are bought.
At the moment its cars are improving only at the same rate as Japanese ones,
so VW need to make a quantum leap to win. <BR>
<BR>
To increase quality, service and price the company must eliminate waste,
he says, but asks: &quot;Where is the waste? Is it time, training, organisation
or the reliability of suppliers?&quot; To explain the importance of looking
at real rather than superficial reasons for waste, he gives the example
of a machine examined in a previous workshop. At first it seemed that the
machine was not working properly because of a defective circuit board. Then
someone noticed there was too little air coming out of the cooling system.
The solution was not to replace expensive circuitry but simply to clean
dust from the filters regularly. <BR>
<BR>
Delau asks participants to identify waste in the seat production department.
Peter says their worry is not physical waste, but waste of time: if a seat
does not fit, for example, they have to make it fit, and that is what takes
time. &quot;If we threw away every part that wasn't an exact fit, we wouldn't
build any cars,&quot; says Maik bitterly. The workers then start voicing
their complaints about the workshop and the company in general. Stefan is
disillusioned, questioning the whole point of being there. He appreciates
that VW has started to ask the opinions of its workers but says it does
not implement the solutions that emerge. <BR>
<BR>
At 10.15, after a short break, it is time for the brainstorming. Cain tells
everyone to shout out anything that irritates them about the job and write
it up on a board. Once she emphasises that nothing they say will go out
of the room, the complaints come thick and fast. &quot;The Polo is thrown
together here, any old way, that is how it looks to me,&quot; says Cain
dryly. <BR>
<BR>
When this is done, the points raised are put together under topic headings
on huge purple posters. The idea is to identify the specific difficulties
the workers have in doing their job as efficiently as possible and what
they see as the solution. If the problem lies outside their department,
it identifies when to call in the relevant experts to explain why it is
done that way and what, if anything, can be done. <BR>
<BR>
By far the greatest problem the Polo seat workers face is the poor quality
of carpets, which they say has existed since the birth of the Polo. They
complain about &quot;permanent wrinkling&quot; and the way supervisors pass
the buck, leaving it to be fixed in post-assembly. &quot;The carpet problem
will be sorted out by the end of the year,&quot; says Cain reassuringly.
&quot;If you can do that, you are a magician,&quot; says Henrik. <BR>
<BR>
They list what they see as the specific problems. The mats do not lie properly;
the carpet is positioned too high up; it is not properly cut and does not
lie over the seat rails. Because of this, seats tear the carpet as they
are installed. Also, by the time the cars get to the seat department the
carpets have been dirtied by other teams, materials or wiring are left under
the carpet or it is simply the wrong colour. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Productivity and quality go hand in hand </B><BR>
<BR>
The solutions are typically simple: to identify the problem with carpet
shape, to make sure the carpet team does its job more carefully and to pass
on information to the other teams that dirty carpets have become a problem.
The foreman responsible is called in. He is sympathetic, asking the right
questions. He explains that the problem is not that they are badly cut,
but they are outsourced and there seems to be a design flaw. <BR>
<BR>
To get to the bottom of the design problem, the quality foreman comes in.
He describes the carpets supplied as &quot;rubbish, absolute rubbish&quot;
and says that out of 50 sets that are supplied, one has to be thrown away
because of bad packaging. But although he sympathises he cannot change anything.
&quot;I cost money, I don't bring it in,&quot; he explains. The group decides
that the only way to get to the bottom of the problem is to set up a meeting
between the department manager and the suppliers. <BR>
<BR>
The next two points discussed are comparatively straightforward. The seat
teams find that further up the production line others were leaving the cars
dirty with wax, paper paint, stains and litter, everything from screws to
Coke cans. The solution is to pass that inform-ation around until the practice
stops. They also complain that the screws they have to use are too oily.
Some have the oil drained off beforehand, others do not and they are left
scrabbling around in a pool of oil trying to find a screw as the car moves
down the production line. <BR>
<BR>
The final issue raised that day is one at the heart of the worries of both
productivity supervisors and workers - a lack of time. Productivity and
quality go hand in hand and Admiraal is keen to emphasise this: &quot;If
someone is running quicker he is going to make errors. We should make sure
that people are not running quicker, we should make sure that people have
to walk less.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The aim of the workshop is to see if the number in each production team
can be reduced by between one and three people at the speed they are working
at now, or if the production line can be speeded up with the same number
of workers. <BR>
<BR>
At the beginning of a shift the production line is set a speed which is
displayed on a huge board above the shop floor, the number of cars that
should run off the line at the end of a 300-minute shift. The target is
to match the Golf line and produce 510 Polos a day, which amounts to a 300-minute-shift
speed of 170. But Halle 8 is a long way off that. In September the average
speed was 140 or 9,194 cars in 22 working days and the fastest managed so
far is 156. For the seat production team, an average of 140 means fitting
30 seats in 70 minutes. <BR>
<BR>
Workers are riled by any comparisons with the Golf line as that is more
mechanised. &quot;I am working as fast as I can,&quot; complains Maik. &quot;Of
course I am going to say that you can [speed up production] if all the other
problems are solved, because they never will be.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
At the beginning of day two there is a recap. Much of the sullenness and
suspicion of the day before has been replaced, if not by optimism, then
at least by cautious openness. Peter says he is happy with the way things
have gone: Stefan is also pleased, provided something gets done. Henrik
says he would be happy if just some of their problems are solved and Maik
is in a bad mood after dropping a flowerpot on his foot that morning. <BR>
<BR>
Without further ado the issue of the seat production work area is addressed.
There are complaints about lack of space, a slippery floor, rain through
the roof. The team also complains about the fact that the tables slip when
car seats are placed on them for greasing, about badly designed shelves
and toolboxes which are too short so that pieces stick out - Maik goes to
fetch one for illustration. In addition, they say, people stand in the way
when they work and the people who deliver parts drive dangerously. <BR>
<BR>
In perhaps the quickest fix of the week, the foreman in charge of tables
is called in and agrees to fix them within the week. The head of the subdivision
for drivers comes in too. He says he will talk to the drivers straightaway
and they could consider it done. <BR>
<BR>
The issue of the toolboxes is a thornier problem. They are currently 420mm
long and ideally should be 480-500mm long. With a proper toolbox each member
of the team could work on up to 15 cars without going back for supplies,
whereas at the moment they have to do so for every car. Various solutions
are considered. Ordering new boxes is rejected as too expensive so the workers
say they will see if they can design one themselves from existing parts.
Two men from the planning department come in. They say they will not commission
another firm to make a bigger box but they agree to see if the current supplier
makes one the right size. By-passing the bureaucracy, over the lunch break
Maik makes one himself. <BR>
<BR>
Another difficulty for KVP2 to overcome is that of middle management inflexibility.
Those at the top of the corporate ladder enthuse about productivity because
a successful company reflects well on them, while on the shop-floor workers
know the problems and want changes which will make their lives easier. But
middle management's main interest is in preserving the status quo. When
the head of the subdivision in Halle 8 comes to the productivity workshop,
to every point raised he replies, &quot;It's not a real problem&quot; or
&quot;tough, that's the way it is done&quot;. Participants are spoiling
for a fight and savage him for two hours. Nevertheless, they are encouraged
by the appearance of the different experts and managers and their enthusiasm
is rising. <BR>
<BR>
Admiraal sighs when the middle management issue is raised but speaks with
understanding of their reaction to change. &quot;People in middle management
get excited when they know they are going to get something out of it. A
manager wants to see something coming out of it for him. We should show
that KVP2 can help him and his people reach his goals, not to see KVP2 as
something extra.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
By Wednesday morning the group is getting tired. But the workshop becomes
less theoretical as participants are brought back onto the shopfloor to
see the difficulties in practice. Peter points out the tables sliding around,
mechanical obstacles and the lack of space. &quot;It's awful, really awful,&quot;
says Cain. <BR>
<BR>
Back in the meeting room, there are more visitors. Friedrich Grebe from
the works committee comes in to discuss ways of speeding up production.
He warns against being too hasty about raising unrealistic expectations
by putting concrete figures on the potential for improvement: &quot;If all
the changes are implemented and it is still not possible [for a shift to
work with three men at 130 rather than four at 140], then heads will roll.&quot;
He also agrees to have a word with the middle manager who proved difficult
the day before. The manager concerned comes in later, an apparently transformed
person, and agrees to look at the issues. <BR>
<BR>
The designer comes in to discuss the carpets and says he will try and set
up a meeting with the heads of the two firms that supply the carpets. He
points out that to change the design would cost in the region of DM12,500.
&quot;But we can't not pay it and let quality go down the drain,&quot; protests
Maik. The designer promises to nail down the problem but the group is sceptical,
pointing out that people from the two firms have come in before for discussions
and nothing has happened. <BR>
<BR>
The final morning is spent going through the result sheet (figure 3). The
conclusion is that if all the suggested changes are implemented, they can
increase production by 10 cars a day. A workshop for suppliers is also proposed.
At 13.00 they present the result sheet to the relevant heads of department,
including Hans-Joachim Paul, head of VW Wolfsburg. Maik, the most gregarious,
makes the presentation, running through the problems identified, the solutions
agreed upon and the timetable for implementing the changes. He finished
with the concrete benefits for VW - a 31% increase in production. Everyone
leaves with the comment from Paul, only partly in jest: &quot;The problem
won't be solved tomorrow. After all, we are in Wolfsburg.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A month later, at the first follow-up meeting, the mood is ugly. The problems
were certainly not solved tomorrow and even by Wolfsburg's standards are
taking a long time. The workers are disillusioned and the enthusiasm generated
by the workshop is somewhat dissipated. &quot;It's worse than before,&quot;
says Stefan. &quot;There's no point,&quot; says Maik. Going through the
result sheet it soon becomes apparent why. Almost every point that was raised
has not been addressed. <BR>
<BR>
Mats are still loose and heating cables are still under carpets which are
still the wrong colour. Henrik says these problems occurred about five times
the previous week on his shift alone. The floors are still slippery and
the workers must re-explain the points they raised a month ago to a still-credulous
head of the subdivision. An increasingly dour Cain says simply: &quot;We
will have to write another letter.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
There is some good news. Work tables have been fixed to the floor and a
date set for the shelves to be put up. Communication in general is now better
and workers do have access to the relevant telephone and beeper numbers.
The information flow has improved, although Maik is still annoyed that issues
which are indirectly relevant to the section are either not discussed with
them or not passed on at all. The department is also getting new supplies
of non-oily screws on January 6. <BR>
<BR>
Most importantly, the meeting between VW and the carpet suppliers did take
place on November 9. Both the five-door and three-door models were discussed
and the design changed. In the four-door model the new cut is 5mm shorter
than the old one while in the two-door the gap for seat rails has been increased
by 2mm. The other coup is that three workshops for suppliers have been pencilled
in for next year - for metal, upholstery and synthetic parts. <BR>
<BR>
Cain says she understands that the workers are disappointed at the moment,
but promises that something will get done before the next follow-up meeting,
planned for the week of January 22. The workers leave disappointed but still
hopeful. <BR>
<BR>
Since 1993 KVP2 workshops have been applied to all aspects of the Volkwagen
organisation, from administration to suppliers, each with difficulties of
its own. But the process has been a boon for suppliers: average productivity
has increased by 77% for 1,046 firms where VW held workshops between 1993
and late 1995. In fact, the system has been so successful that KVP2 coaching
has been spun off into a separate management consultant-type division, set
to work for organisations ranging from the chemicals giant Bayer to the
German army. <BR>
<BR>
What makes the workshops successful is not only the changes in physical
processes on the shopfloor, but the dissolution of barriers between the
different players in the production process. Should there be another problem
with the carpet design, the workers can prime their foreman to talk directly
to a named designer, not a faceless voice at the end of a telephone. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, although productivity's converts enthuse about what Admiraal
calls his &quot;religion&quot;, achieving world-class productivity in Germany's
auto plants remains elusive. When - or whether - VW can make its necessary
quantum leap is still an open question.<HR>

<H4>A VW WORKER IS FOR LIFE </H4>
In its major decisions, Volkswagen must reckon with several parties whose
interests can be diametrically opposed to the reformers in the KVP2 team.
The so-called <I>Mitbestimmung</I> system which gives unions a place on
the supervisory board of the larger companies has contributed to Germany's
industrial success. The system has been valuable in helping to avoid confrontation
between workers and management. But in the case of Volkswagen, the metalworkers'
union IG Metall and the state of Lower Saxony have a blocking vote on the
board and a vital say on issues such as redundancy. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The state <BR>
<BR>
</B>The Wolfsburg workers have a guardian angel in the person of Gerhard
Schr&ouml;der, the high-profile SPD president of Lower Saxony. The state
owns 20% VW's shares, giving Schr&ouml;der a seat on the supervisory board.
The opposition CDU party has said that should it come to power, there would
be no question of it selling off the share. <BR>
<BR>
Mindful of the implications of such power, Daimler-Benz chairman J&uuml;rgen
Schrempp recently rejected a proposal by the mayor of Hamburg for the state
to buy back the company's troubled aerospace arm Dasa, to prevent further
job losses. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The unions <BR>
<BR>
</B>German trade unions have traditionally wielded more influence than their
European colleagues and Klaus Zwickel, president of the metalworkers' union
IG Metall, has a seat on the board. Its high-profile influence is also reflected
in the posters adorning the factory which proclaim, &quot;The breaks stay
as they are,&quot; and in the fact that union duties are carried out during
the working day rather than after it, as at most factories. <BR>
<BR>
The September round of pay negotiations was a hard struggle and VW estimates
that it lost DM300 million due to walkouts. It won the battle, but whether
it will win the war remains to be seen. The union compromised on overtime
pay for Saturday shifts, reducing the five-minute break per hour to two-and-a-half
minutes, and on the flexibility of weekly shifts which can range from 28.8
to 38.8 hours. But in return Volkswagen has agreed not to fire any workers
for the next two years. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The structures - not just the official but also the informal ones
- have been growing over the years and it is hard to get in there,&quot;
says Willem Admiraal at KVP2 management. In any organisation the size of
Volkswagen, factionalism is a factor. Jos&eacute; Ignacio Lopez is director
of production optimisation and purchasing and not director of production
on the board of VW Group. It is a nuance that has much to do with the old
guard. <p>

<H2>WHO'S AFRAID OF RUSSIA? </H2>
<H4>Russia's surge in support for old-style communists has generated comment
and concern in the west. Stay calm, advises Anatol Lieven </H4>
When journalists use the phrase &quot;critical period&quot; or &quot;vital
turning point&quot;, it usually means that they have run out of things to
say. The difference with Russia is that the critical periods really have
been critical - and another one is on the way. The coming months are likely
to decide whether Russia continues on the halting path of semi-democracy,
swings to some form of overt authoritarianism or, in the worst case, descends
into political violence. <BR>
<BR>
This process is guaranteed to be alarming for many observers. As November's
US presidential elections come closer, accompanied by the usual flood of
stern foreign policy rhetoric, policymakers may well over-react to events
in Russia and in the process help produce exactly the results feared. For
while there is not much the west can do to influence Russian affairs for
the better, there is a lot it can do to make them worse. The key message
is: don't panic. <BR>
<BR>
Not everyone did panic after December 1995's elections to the parliament
or Duma, when the communists emerged as the biggest single party by far.
This is partly because the Duma's powers are limited and partly because
there were mixed messages. Although Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalists, the
so-called Liberal Democrats, saw their vote halved they still came second
and remain the most prominent of the nationalist groups. More predictably,
the genuine liberal parties were trounced with only Grigory Yavlinsky's
party jumping the 5% hurdle to reach parliament. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
was beaten into third place, diminishing his chances of succeeding Boris
Yeltsin in June's presidential elections. <BR>
<BR>
Residual western fear of Russia remains strong and is constantly stoked
by a variety of right-wing politicians and lobbies. The outcome of the parliamentary
poll was enough to reinforce the belief among this group that they face
a return of the Soviet menace which must be countered by faster Nato expansion
into central Europe, rearmament and a &quot;strengthening&quot; of the former
Soviet republics. If they hold sway, relations with Russia will be sucked
into a downward spiral with unforseeable effects on regional stability.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Between dream and ambition </B><BR>
<BR>
In my view, none of this is necessary. While it is obvious that the Russians
retain an ambition to dominate the former Soviet region, it is much more
questionable whether they have the military or economic resources to do
so. Despite his vote Zhirinovsky is probably no longer a presidential threat,
while other leading contenders are fundamentally rational figures who understand
the limitations of Russian power. Given Moscow's economic dependence on
the west and the interest of key elites in retaining stable relations, even
a government playing an authoritarian card at home is unlikely to risk sanctions
by indulging in outright aggression. It will, however, react to what it
sees as Nato aggression. <BR>
<BR>
So who is likely to occupy the Kremlin after June? If the elections are
held as scheduled, such is the dislike and contempt for Yeltsin among ordinary
Russians that an opposition victory is a strong possibility. Yeltsin's unpopularity
is hardly surprising. No politician, least of all a western one, would win
a free election after presiding over the impoverishment of much of his population,
the erosion of his country's status in the world, a massive explosion of
crime and a bloody and unnecessary military debacle on home ground. <BR>
<BR>
Yet the December elections have made it far from clear who is best placed
to challenge Yeltsin. It was formerly thought that General Alexander Lebed
was running ahead of the pack, but his party was badly beaten at the polls.
Throughout, the army showed itself both naive and divided as generals stood
as candidates for different parties and many other ranks voted for the hopeless
Zhirinovsky. Even so, it is probably a mistake to see Lebed as a busted
flush. He received a big vote in his own constituency and has plenty of
time to make himself better known in the rest of the country. For Yeltsin,
the dream opponent from the nationalist camp would be Zhirinovsky if the
election went to a second round. The president's camp knows that many Russians
would not vote for him under any circumstances. <BR>
<BR>
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov probably lacks the charisma to win: journalists
who spoke to communist voters in December found many saying explicitly that
they would not back Zyuganov for the presidency. There are other possible
candidates in the pro-communist camp including the hardline but impressive
Siberian industrialist Pyotr Romanov and the former Soviet premier Nikolai
Ryzhkov, who is seen as decent and honest. Yet it is doubtful whether Zyuganov
would just meekly step aside for either of these men, raising the prospect
of a damaging split in the victorious communist ranks. <BR>
<BR>
To avoid such an outcome Yeltsin or his close aides, such as the Kremlin
Guard commander General Alexander Korzhakov, might be tempted to violate
the constitution and postpone or cancel the elections. Both the guard and
forces of the Federal Security Service, the successor to the KGB which is
run by Korzhakov's crony General Barsukov, could conceivably be used for
this. It is a risky option, however, which might lead to mass protests,
violence and even attempted <I>coups d'&eacute;tat</I>, although it is also
possible that Yeltsin's opponents would wait in the expectation that his
failing health will save them the trouble. <BR>
<BR>
Of all possible developments, the only one likely to soothe western fears
would be a smooth and democratic handover of power from Yeltsin to Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, a man foreign governments know they can work
with. This is not just because of Chernomyrdin's cautious, pragmatic and
bureaucratic character but because the former energy minister's main support
comes from the oil and gas industries. The energy sector depends utterly
on continued exports to the west and would back no foreign adventure which
might lead to western sanctions against Russia. The only other outcome likely
to be actively welcomed by the west would be victory for the liberal opposition
figure Grigory Yavlinsky. This is possible but very unlikely. Every other
likely outcome would send western commentators scrambling for their word
processors to declare that Russia is fast returning to totalitarianism,
militarism, or imperialism and that defences must be strengthened to meet
the renewed threat. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Growing suspicion of the west </B><BR>
<BR>
But how much of a threat does Russia really present? The new partnership
between Moscow and the west, so trumpeted at the dusk of Gorbachov and dawn
of Yeltsin, is looking decidedly tattered but is not yet completely dead.
Russian participation with the US in the joint Bosnian peacekeeping force,
Russia's membership of Nato's Partnership for Peace and the west's support
for major new IMF loans to Moscow show that both sides retain an interest
in cooperation - albeit from a desire to limit the other side's bad behaviour
rather than from a sense of shared objectives. <BR>
<BR>
However, virtually all the main Russian political groups are now suspicious
of the west. The only major political figure to survive from the old democratic
camp of 1991 is Grigory Yavlinsky. Yet even his political partner, former
ambassador Vladimir Lukin, has been a strong and articulate critic of Nato's
proposed eastward expansion. Indeed, opposition to Nato expansion is now
a universally held view within the Russian establishment. <BR>
<BR>
It is underpinned by a strong belief that in recent years the west has used
the language of universal values and international cooperation to trick
Russia into making unnecessary concessions, for example over defending the
civic rights of Russians in the Baltic states or selling armaments to unstable
areas of the world, and then betraying those ideals whenever its own interests
have so demanded. <BR>
<BR>
According to this new consensus, Russian foreign policy must be guided by
a cold assessment of its own national interests. This does not necessarily
imply cultural anti-western or anti-democratic feeling. <BR>
<BR>
If sensitivity to outside criticism is widespread, so too is the belief
that Russia has a vital interest in retaining some kind of sphere of influence
in the former Soviet Union, at least to the extent of preventing any other
great power or alliance from gaining a military foothold there. In principle,
most Russian leaders would also like to draw all or some of the other former
Soviet republics (with the exception of the Baltic states) into a loose
confederation under Russian hegemony. These open ambitions have become the
stuff of western arguments for Nato expansion, arguments that are likely
to grow much stronger if the political process in Russia throws up a military
president, a communist administration or a Yeltsin dictatorship. <BR>
<BR>
For the west, the main questions to explore are the following: <BR>
<BR>
*Would a victory of the communist or nationalist opposition lead to a violently
anti-western foreign policy and/or strong attempts to subjugate other former
Soviet republics, most notably the economically important Ukraine? <BR>
<BR>
*Would it lead to a massive rolling-back of economic reforms and a renationalisation
of much or all of the private sector, involving a destruction of those business
elements with a stake in continued economic links with the west? <BR>
<BR>
*Is there a greater threat of authoritarian rule from Yeltsin or from the
communist/nationalist opposition and how extreme might such authoritarianism
become? <BR>
<BR>
*How great is the danger that, torn between these currents, central government
in Russia may become effectively paralysed leading to an effective break-up
of Russia along regional lines, a greater criminalisation of society or
even a new civil war? <BR>
<BR>
*What if anything can we do to help? <BR>
<BR>
<B>The land which ideology forgot </B><BR>
<BR>
The first point to keep in mind is that while there is a real threat of
authoritarianism in Russia it will remain limited. There is no possibility
whatsoever that it will lead to renewed totalitarianism, either of the pre-Gorbachev
communist variety or in some new nationalist form. This is because, even
if a developed ideology were to hand, the central Russian state simply does
not have the resources to impose such an ideology on society. <BR>
<BR>
Far too much power has devolved to the regions and republics or lies in
the hands of new social groups. There is no omnipresent, tightly organised
party which could help the state overcome local resistance. The communists
are by far the best organised party - which is why they have done so well
electorally - but to think that they could restore the ideological and social
apparatus of Soviet times is a fantasy. <BR>
<BR>
So too is any thought that Russia could generate a new ideology of world
conquest in the foreseeable future. The Russian communists may not have
become &quot;social democrats&quot; like their equivalents in Poland or
Hungary, but they are very far from being Bolsheviks. They simply do not
have the necessary spirit and are generally much too old. <BR>
<BR>
Russia, if less democratic than many had hoped, is also a great deal more
stable than many had feared. Among the nationalists, neither the relatively
centrist Lebed nor <BR>
the more extreme Alexander Rutskoi and Zhirinovsky possess even the germ
of a <BR>
mass movement akin to that of the Nazis, a necessary condition if the popular
analogy with prewar Weimar Germany were to make any sense. The vast majority
of ordinary Russians are far too apathetic, far too obsessed with economic
survival and far too cynical about politicians in general to be mobilised
in this way. <BR>
<BR>
Seventy years of communist rule led to an immense boredom with the whole
idea of party membership, symbolic marches and demonstrations, party slogans
and so on. This is especially true of educated younger people, among whom
the idea of communism had died long before the reformist Mikail Gorbachov
took power. Today most Russians cannot even tell one political party from
another - not surprising since most party programmes are meaningless and
interchangeable. <BR>
<BR>
It is true that the great majority of Russians hold more or less nationalist
beliefs, often with an imperial tinge. But here one needs to distinguish
between the bar-room sentiments which produced some success for Zhirinovsky
in Duma elections and the actual willingness of ordinary Russians to sacrifice
blood or money to achieve their supposed goals. Opinion polls have shown
most Russians to be opposed or thoroughly unenthusiastic about the use of
the army in Chechnya, for example, despite a traditional deep dislike for
the Chechens which led many observers (and perhaps the Russian government)
to assume that any intervention would be popular. The war has also been
deeply unpopular in the army itself and demoralisation of the Russian troops
in Chechnya was obvious from the very beginning. <BR>
<BR>
The threat of authoritarianism is now a very real one, mainly because authoritarian
rule under the right leadership would be extremely popular in a country
yearning for a crackdown on crime and the restoration of certain basic services
and social guarantees. Democratic values are often barely skin-deep, even
among so-called liberals. Business supporters of President Yeltsin, fearful
of a return of the communists, have begun to talk of the need for a &quot;Russian
Pinochet&quot; to guarantee the continuation of free market reform or, as
their critics believe, the continuation of ill-gotten gains. From the opposition,
General Lebed has argued in the same terms. So far, however, moves in this
direction have been very limited, as shown by the generally unsuccessful
attempts at censorship during the Chechen fighting. While the free media
is endangered, it is still genuinely free: the independent television station
NTV continues to broadcast its satirical puppet show &quot;Kukhli&quot;
with its savage portrayals of Yeltsin and his staff. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Letting inflation off the leash </B><BR>
<BR>
An authoritarian regime could undoubtedly do a good deal of economic damage,
not least by letting inflation off the leash once again. But however populist
its rhetoric, it could not possibly set about renationalising most of the
property privatised over the past three years. <BR>
<BR>
The key once again is the regions. Any central government now has to rule
through the regional administrative and managerial elites which have profited
immensely from privatisation and which are thoroughly intertwined with the
banks and corporate sector. They would simply not tolerate any return to
the <I>status quo ante</I>. <BR>
<BR>
Private business is now backing every single major party. General Lebed's
main political partner, former deputy premier Yuri Skokov, is closely linked
to the military-industrial complex whose senior managers have been made
rich by privatisation and the sometimes illegal sale of <I>materiel </I>to
the west. Even the communists have at least two big businessmen on their
electoral list, including a representative of the huge Most Bank conglomerate
which has put its eggs in several political baskets. <BR>
<BR>
Despite such strong business links, any new regime might still conduct a
highly public review of some privatisation cases and might select a few
symbolic businessmen for punishment. This is one reason why those businessmen
seen as close to the Yeltsin regime are worried sick, appealing to western
sympathisers and journalists to support an authoritarian &quot;rescue&quot;
of the economic reform process. Given the way many of them acquired their
wealth and how they like to spend it, however, there is no need to feel
very much personal sympathy for these people. <BR>
<BR>
Would a more authoritarian domestic regime be more likely to pursue an aggressive
external policy? If it were in the hands of unstable extremists such as
Zhirinovsky or Rutskoi, the answer would certainly be yes. Fortunately,
however, their victory looks unlikely. If Yeltsin is replaced it will be
either by some pragmatic figure from within the regime, a communist-backed
candidate or a relatively moderate nationalist like Lebed. <BR>
<BR>
More importantly, for the foreseeable future any Russian regime will be
subject to extremely tight constraints beyond the country's borders as superpower
status is a thing of the past. The extent of Russian weakness has been harshly
demonstrated by its failure to prevent or even influence American actions
in Bosnia. As commentator Dmitri Babich put it: &quot;Russia has been forced
to concoct the most absurd excuses in order to conceal the deplorable fact
of its own impotence.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In their private arguments against Nato expansion, diplomats have been reduced
to warning that Russia will be powerful again some time in the future and
the west should therefore be careful not to throw away its friendship unnecessarily:
&quot;You will need us again if China turns nasty&quot; is a common refrain.
As a matter of fact this makes good sense, but an argument based on what
might be the case several years from now fails to cut much ice with western
policymakers worried about more immediate pressures. <BR>
<BR>
Even if Russia had the ideology and leadership to carry out a major act
of aggression, there is no money to bankroll such an adventure. The central
state is chronically short of money because of a large-scale collapse in
the collection of revenue, in the face of massive tax evasion and official
corruption. If a new government can recreate an effective state apparatus,
the Russian state might again become a formidable force in 10 years' time.
At the moment, however, corruption and criminality have become so embedded
that for the foreseeable future it looks likely to preside ineffectually
over a semi-anarchy. The effects of revenue shortfalls on the armed forces
were starkly revealed by the engagement in Chechnya, where bad training
and equipment intensified troop demoralisation and lack of discipline. An
effective Russian army would need to be subjected to a major campaign against
pervasive corruption and receive a massive inflow of funds to make the forces
professional. <BR>
<BR>
There is also no will at present to subjugate the former Soviet republics
of Ukraine and the Baltic states by force, nor indeed for the kind of massive
financial sacrifices necessary to draw Ukraine into a closer economic union
with Russia. Moscow has even refused to create a currency union with Belarus,
despite pleas from Minsk. Put plainly, Russia is close to bankruptcy. The
money to subsidise a new imperium is simply not available. <BR>
<BR>
Ukraine, a valuable and historically key part of the former Soviet empire,
has been a particular flashpoint. But it is simply too big a morsel to be
swallowed, while most Russians regard the Ukrainians as erring brothers.
The Yeltsin administration has pursued an extremely cautious policy over
discontented ethnic Russians living in Crimea and has not allowed a dispute
over the Black Sea fleet to get out of hand. <BR>
<BR>
Even in the divided and embattled Transcaucasus Moscow has been more cautious
than many analysts appreciate, if only because there is in fact no Caucasian
policy as such. Every ministry and interest group has pursued its own agenda.
Moscow's recent agreement to an oil pipeline from Azerbaijan passing through
Georgia and Turkey, rather than Russian territory, is a welcome indication
that pragmatists can still get their way. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Surprises and how to avoid them </B><BR>
<BR>
It is my belief that in the end, Russia will accept Nato membership for
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as long as Nato makes clear it is
not going to expand any further, and as long as Russia receives some kind
of compensation in other fields. But for this process of gradual acceptance
to continue, the expansion itself must be gradual and exclude surprise moves
such as the US declaration of support for Nato expansion in November 1994.
<BR>
<BR>
But there are some scenarios which would change everything. A rushed invitation
for central Europe to join Nato could generate Russian aggression over the
Baltic states, particularly if it looked as if they too might join a fearful
stampede. Western European officials have repeatedly assured the Russians
in private that there is no chance of this happening, but the Russians feel
that they have been tricked so often that they have no great faith left
in western promises. The Russian army in particular regards the possibility
of Nato expansion into Ukraine and Russia as a mortal geopolitical threat.
Lebed is a prime representative of this element in society and has expressed
himself in almost hysterical terms on the subject, warning in the event
of a &quot;Third World War&quot;. Yet he strongly opposed military operations
in Chechnya and Tajikistan and has told me that he regards the notion of
war with Ukraine for Crimea as &quot;inconceivable&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
This illustrates a key point for the west: there is no will in the Russian
establishment to take the risks of a drive westwards, unless this is seen
as an essential response to Nato's advance eastwards. If the eastern half
of Europe becomes destabilised in the next year, it will be the doing of
the west, not Russia. <BR>
<BR>
The other possible major western mistake would be to allow fear of Lebed,
the army or the communists to panic policymakers into overt or tacit support
for a suspension of democracy by Yeltsin's team. In October 1993, western
support for Yeltsin's bloody military assault on rebels in the parliament
could be justified in terms of his own democratic legitimacy, the threat
of chaos or a truly hardline backlash. But for the west today to support
the installation of a Yeltsin dictatorship would be something very different.
To support a coup engineered by the former hardmen of the Soviet system,
the KGB and their newfound friends in the private sector would be utterly
wrong and would destroy what remains of western moral influence in Russia.
<BR>
<BR>
The best western policy in the months to come should be to watch and wait,
while continuing a dialogue with Russia wherever this seems useful. In diplomacy
as in life, if you're not sure what to do, there is a strong case for doing
nothing.<BR>

<H3>THE MAGNIFICENT 7 </H3>
<H4>Seven crucial figures in this year's battle for control of the Kremlin </H4>
<B>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin </B><BR><BR>
A former apparatchik and cautious pragmatic, Chernomyrdin is now regarded
by western governments as a man they can do business with. Critics accuse
him of using his official positions to acquire immense private wealth through
undeclared shares in the huge semi-privatised gas company Gasprom which
he used to head. His strongest support, both political and financial, continues
to come from the oil and gas sector. Among the Russian public he is not
actively unpopular, like Boris Yeltsin, but he is an uninspiring figure
and it is difficult to say how he would do in a free presidential election.<BR><BR>
<B>Lt General Alexander Korzhakov </B><BR>
A former KGB officer assigned to guard Yeltsin when Gorbachev first moved
him to Moscow in 1985 and since then his closest friend: Yeltsin writes
glowingly of Korzhakov in the latest volume of his autobiography and he
is now generally regarded as the president's closest adviser. Today Korzhakov
commands the presidential guard, which on paper at least has a strength
of 40,000 men. He is also very close to Mikhail Barsukov, chief of the Federal
Security Service, the former KGB. During Yeltsin's latest bout of heart
trouble in October, Korzhakov was often the only aide allowed access for
more than a few minutes. He must know that if Yeltsin goes, he goes too
and might then face imprisonment for various alleged abuses of authority.
According to reports, he has urged Yeltsin to hang on at all costs.<BR><BR> 
<B>Lt General Alexander Lebed </B><BR>
Joint leader of the opposition Congress of Russian Communities (KRO), originally
founded to defend ethnic Russians beyond the republic's borders but now
a broad umbrella group including both hardline nationalists and minority
Tatar and Bashkin groups. An alarming-looking figure, whose name means swan
but whose face and voice are more reminiscent of a gorilla, he is apparently
regarded by Yeltsin's staff as their most dangerous opponent. He is certainly
the most charismatic of all the potential candidates and appeals to the
current longing for &quot;order&quot; and a strong hand. From his time as
commander of the 14th Army in the troubled region of Moldova, he has won
a reputation for incorruptibility, discipline and moral courage. But he
has to contend with the traditional Russian distrust of Bonapartist figures.
Moreover, he has shown signs of being out of his depth in the new world
of politics, leading to explosions of anger which could harm his image as
a sober leader.<BR><BR> 
<B>Yuri Skokov </B><BR>
Joint leader of KRO and a grey figure from the old Soviet state. He was
deputy premier from 1991 to 1993 but was sacked by Yeltsin for opposing
his moves against the hostile parliament of the time. He is closely linked
to heavy industry, the military-industrial complex and provincial leaders
in the Volga region. Without Skokov's support Lebed would probably not have
the establishment backing or financial support to run for president. However,
Skokov has also been close to Yeltsin's chief of staff Viktor Ilyushin.
In one scenario, there have been backstage negotiations about Yeltsin sacking
Chernomyrdin and appointing Skokov in his place to help the current president
hang onto power. Skokov himself would then have a good chance of winning
the presidency when Yeltsin finally drops off his perch.<BR><BR> 
<B>Grigory Yavlinsky </B><BR>
Leader of the Yabloka party and the last major liberal to retain any mass
popularity, largely because he was out of power when Yegor Gaidar implemented
bitterly unpopular free market reforms in 1992. Yavlinsky is determined
to run for president, but as a Jewish Muscovite intellectual is thought
unlikely to succeed in winning many votes in the provinces.<BR><BR> 
<B>Vladimir Zhirinovsky </B><BR>
Leader of the grotesquely misnamed &quot;Liberal Democratic Party&quot;,
he is half neo-fascist, half clown. He remains prominent but has seen his
support badly reduced by competition from Lebed and Alexander Rutskoi, both
of whom appeal to the same electorate in a more sober way. Zhirinovsky has
been discredited by public drunkenness, brawling, hooliganism, allegations
of homosexuality, an electoral list containing numerous criminals - you
name it. However, such is the mixture of apathy and disgust with politics
among many Russians that he could still do surprisingly well. There is also
word of calculations among Yeltsin's staff that a second-round presidential
election run-off between Yeltsin and Zhirinovsky might produce a surge of
support for Yeltsin, both among voters and in the west.<BR><BR> 
<B>Valery Zyuganov </B><BR>
Leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the main successor
to the old Soviet Communist party and by far the best organised party in
Russia today, Zyuganov has recently been making efforts to portray his party
as social democratic,like former communists in central Europe. At a meeting
with US businessmen in October, he said he wanted to reverse illegal and
corrupt privatisations and restore social welfare rather than re-nationalise
the entire economy. Not all of his audience were convinced, remembering
past fiery communist rhetoric. Zyuganov's problem is that while his party
is strong, he himself is an uncharismatic figure generally thought to stand
little chance of winning an election. He may therefore decide to stand back
and back a more promising candidate, such as Gorbachev's former prime minister<BR><BR>
Nikolai Ryzhkov<.p>

<H2>JAPAN MARKET WHAT MARKET?</H2>
<H4>Orthodox economists have ignored a key institution, born in war, which
makes concepts like profit close to irrelevant. Karel van Wolferen explains
why </H4>
Japan scares economists. It is a horror story for the few who have not ignored
it because the more trained they are in economic orthodoxy, the less capable
they are of understanding the dynamics of the Japanese economy. With their
market-centred thinking, mainstream economists cannot possibly make sense
of what is, in effect, a war economy operating in peacetime. <BR>
<BR>
The world's second largest economy remains a blur on the periphery of most
people's vision, including those in positions which require it to be in
clear focus. Rather than improving as interaction with Japan intensified,
this odd phenomenon has only worsened: since reports of serious financial
and industrial trouble began to circulate some years ago, confusion has
been the norm. Conflicting images coexist, sometimes in the minds of the
same observers, of impending doom and of a Japan consolidating its forces
in a peacetime &quot;greater co-prosperity sphere.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Puzzlement is mixed with a new ambivalence, particularly among US financial
authorities, about the intentions and trustworthiness of Japan's economic
guardians. In Tokyo, officials of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) appear determined
to ensure that Japanese financial institutions do nothing to help trigger
any increase in US interest rates, especially in an American presidential
election year. Yet the failure of these same officials to inform their US
colleagues about the irregularities perpetrated by Daiwa Bank angered the
Federal Reserve enough for it to shut down all of Daiwa's American operations.
<BR>
<BR>
What is the story on Japan? Do alarming suggestions of an impending financial
meltdown have any foundation? Are Americans and Europeans right in asserting
that Japanese industrial might is no longer a serious challenge? Does Japan's
longest postwar period of sluggishness indicate fundamental difficulties
for which the formerly resourceful bureaucrats have no solution? What is
one to think of an economy whose main stockmarket recently lost about half
its value in less than a year, but which busily continues to invest in skyscrapers?
<BR>
<BR>
The main reason for this confusion is the existence of conceptual filters
that make invisible many of Japan's essentials: in particular that of mainstream
economics which tells us that markets are pivotal institutions in determining
economic outcomes. This filter is imposed by all but a very few university
economic courses and maintained by publications such as <I>The Wall Street
Journal</I>, <I>The Economist</I> and <I>The Financial Times</I> whose reports
are echoed all over the world. Allegiance to the conceptual world thus created
is a fundamental requirement for appointment and promotion in Anglo-Saxon
academia and for membership of many western political elites. <BR>
<BR>
But Japan is too important to remain so blurred. We need to look at an economic
institution other than the market which will allow us to make better sense
of it. This institution, brought to a high level of effectiveness by Japan's
economic guardians, does not yet have a name but I propose to call it credit
ordering. It works through highly coordinated credit creation, credit denial
and credit allocation. It is rooted in wartime financing methods and wartime
restrictions on entrepeneurism. Since 1945 it has been pivotal in determining
economic outcomes in Japan. <BR>
<BR>
The most important result of credit ordering has been the removal of credit
risk for large corporations. Totally socialised credit risk provides entire
sectors with the wherewithal to engage in massive expansion and campaigns
to enlarge international market share without regard to demand or profitability.
Credit ordering also ensures the hierarchical order of Japanese industry
and has become a condition for the survival of a highly effective industrial
organisation. <BR>
<BR>
One reason why this crucial phenomenon has barely attracted attention in
the west, why it has remained invisible in economic theory and why it easily
eludes our conceptual grasp is that it does not rest on any theoretical
underpinnings. It evolved through trial and error under the guidance of
officials, many of whom had managed Japan's industrial effort during 15
years of war in Asia. Their main concern was that nothing should ever stand
in the way of building ever-greater productive capacity. Credit ordering
operates in an economy in which transactions are based, in the final analysis,
not on economic considerations of profit-making but on political ones of
mutual protection and long-term expansionist goals. <BR>
<BR>
To make sense of credit ordering we need to understand the way two huge
intersecting structures ensure order among Japan's large corporations: the
horizontal <I>keiretsu</I> and the web of federations or industrial associations
in every branch of industry. They perform powerful complementary functions
that are extralegal and frequently at odds with official regulations, such
as the anti-trust laws enforced in theory by Japan's Fair Trade Commission.
The six large <I>keiretsu</I> that tie together companies in different industrial
sectors only began to draw attention in the US around 1989; the many associations
that coordinate the activities of companies in the same industry have remained
largely ignored. <BR>
<BR>
Details differ considerably from one <I>keiretsu </I>to the next, but typically
it groups large manufacturers in major branches of industry, clustered around
a bank and a trading company. Non-life and life insurance firms also belong.
Corporate policies are not dictated to individual members by an all-powerful
<I>keiretsu</I> centre since no such entity exists. But the assertive tendencies
of each firm are strongly curtailed by the informal commands of group integration,
mistakenly represented in Japanese parlance as loyalty - mistakenly,
because they have no choice. A few very powerful companies - Toyota
comes immediately to mind - need not worry much about fellow <I>keiretsu</I>
members but the rest must obey what the group decides, regardless of any
disadvantage to themselves. Such companies own each other, making orthodox
notions of ownership close to irrelevant. Power in Japan's large corporations
is diffuse to a point where accountability is practically non-existent.
The fact that no one is ultimately in charge of the <I>keiretsu</I> clusters
nor ultimately responsible for them means they are sufficiently amorphous
to permit industry-wide bureaucratic interference. <BR>
<BR>
Instead of emanating directly from government ministries, interference is
mostly channelled through the industrial associations. Sometimes dominated
by one or two of the largest corporations, these monitor and control all
industrial sectors, coordinate production plans in developing or shrinking
sectors, help with collective technology acquisition and give direction
to development at the highest levels. Top officials are frequently retired
bureaucrats from government agencies administering that sector. Major decisions
are as binding as if they were law. Since non-membership means virtual exclusion
from the economic mainstream, and Japanese firms do not in practice have
recourse to legal means of asserting themselves, all companies fall under
the informal jurisdiction of these cartel-like structures. <BR>
<BR>
Contrary to popular belief, <I>keiretsu</I> are not simply postwar versions
of the earlier <I>zaibatsu</I>. They are a novel form of industrial organisation,
considerably more dependent on support from the bureaucracy. The <I>zaibatsu</I>
had been largely reluctant participants in Japan's war in China and against
the US, and in the final years of fighting the government found it necessary
to introduce ways of tying Japan's manufacturing more closely to the war
effort. <BR>
<BR>
This paved the way for a set of industrial relationships that made the postwar
credit ordering possible. The Bank of Japan gained control over the commercial
banks with the establishment of the Monetary Control Association in 1942.
A year later, bureaucrats in the MOF and Ministry of Munitions (institutional
parent of MITI, the ministry of trade and industry) designed a system of
&quot;authorised financial institutions&quot; to pay for the war. The <I>zaibatsu</I>
banks were selected for this purpose, along with the government's Industrial
Bank of Japan. Backed by 56 smaller banks designated to &quot;absorb funds
from the private sector,&quot; insurers and the savings system, together
they ensured an unimpeded flow of funds to firms ordered to meet the requirements
of the military. These arrangements became the basis for the postwar &quot;main
bank&quot; system which guarantees that large corporations never go bankrupt.
And they foreshadowed the <I>keiretsu</I> banks' function as inexhaustible
money pumps during the high-growth '50s and '60s. <BR>
<BR>
The occupying American authorities inadvertently promoted bureaucratic power
over business when they disbanded the holding companies which had been the
control centres of the <I>zaibatsu</I>. This removed potential opposition
to government officials, who in the late '40s began applying at home what
they had learned from the forced industrial development of their wartime
Manchurian colony. Without the holding companies, economic decision-making
was transferred from bureaucracies in private hands to a bureaucracy guided
by financial mandarins in government, with decisive power over the allocation
of scarce capital. <BR>
<BR>
Shortly after the departure of the occupying US authorities, a practice
known as &quot;overloan&quot; and &quot;overborrowing&quot; became common,
radically changing the financing of Japanese industry. Inspired by the wartime
financing of munition companies, the large banks increased their lending
to companies belonging to their group (only later did the term <I>keiretsu</I>
emerge) without being required to make proportionately larger deposits with
the central bank. <BR>
<BR>
Japan has been the only major industrial country in which, for most of its
high growth period, loans from and discounts with the central bank exceeded
the deposits of the commercial banks. Whereas the prewar average rate of
borrowed money fluctuated between just under and just over a third of the
total assets of Japanese companies (roughly similar to the postwar pattern
in western industrialised countries), between the '50s and the end of the
'70s it rose to four-fifths of capital of an average company. <BR>
<BR>
The unleashing of postwar entrepreneurial enthusiasm was undoubtedly important
for what became known as Japan's economic miracle. But at the same time
many rules curtailed entrepreneurial freedom, most of them informal and
extralegal. The private sector became thoroughly dependent on the central
bureaucracy while methods of forced economic development were applied to
the rebuilding of Japan's war-devastated economy. The dependency of big
business on central coordination and protection increased further as the
policies of postwar reconstruction evolved into an unofficial policy of
unlimited industrial expansion. This national policy was never examined
by the Japanese parliament, nor explicitly discussed in any public forum.
<BR>
<BR>
As a result, Japan's industrial organisation is less similar today to those
of traditional free enterprise countries than it was in the '20s. The greatest
difference is that besides enforcing property rights as a fundamental economic
role of government, Japan's officialdom also enforces what may be called
credit rights. Consumer credit remained virtually unknown until the '70s
and continues to be restrained, rigged by custom in favour of retailers.
Rigid sluices in the financial system have ensured that the comparatively
large pool of household savings is made available for industrial investment.
<BR>
<BR>
Prices in the Japanese consumer economy are almost wholly fixed, and allow
for a very heavy <I>de facto </I>tax with which Japanese households help
subsidise export industries considered &quot;strategic&quot;. Over the last
25 years, as the value of the yen against the dollar increased fourfold,
Japan's exporters have seen their profit-margins dwindle to almost nothing,
requiring the systematic subsidy of Japanese industry by the <I>keiretsu</I>
banks. Until 1990 such banks showed positive results on their books only
because of the impact of inflationary equity and real estate markets. Contrary
to frequent reports of diminishing bureaucratic influence and greater independence
in the private sector, the past two decades have seen a consolidation of
power by the <I>keiretsu</I> and industrial association system. The natural
result has been the erasure, for all practical purposes, of any division
between private and public sectors. <BR>
<BR>
Dissatisfied western trading partners have long decried Japanese government
interference, creating artificial economic advantage for the country's firms,
and have applauded plans for deregulation. But in Japan deregulation is
normally replaced by informal arrangements that accomplish the same protective
aims, as the entire system has no choice but to strive for Japanese advantage.
There are no impartial regulators scrutinising important economic transactions
and wrong-doing in this realm is not subject to legal process. Neither the
Bank of Japan, nor the MOF which controls it, function as a referee. They
are fundamentally different institutions compared to central banks elsewhere
in the industrialised world. Hence it should be no surprise that the MOF
felt no compelling need to inform the world's central bankers what Daiwa
Bank had been up to. <BR>
<BR>
Outside the bank-supported core of Japanese industrial organisation there
is little opportunity for a solitary entrepreneur dependent on long-term
domestic investment to flourish. Capital markets comparable to those of
Europe or the US do not exist. Only a few medium-sized companies can establish
a market niche allowing them the freedom to make their own decisions. Small
companies in service sector areas considered marginal, such as hairdressers,
fashion businesses and small retailers, have access to more expensive funding
but find significant expansion almost impossible without linking up in some
way with a <I>keiretsu</I> or smaller <I>keiretsu</I>-like cluster. <BR>
<BR>
The relations smaller manufacturers have with their &quot;mother&quot; firms
is the sole determinant of their creditworthiness. Many retailers are wholly
or partly ensconced in so-called distribution <I>keiretsu</I>: dealer associations
with which manufacturers control their domestic market shares, a system
especially visible in the consumer electronics sector. <BR>
<BR>
Large manufacturers are themselves often the stellar centres of huge planetary
systems, with 100 or more subcontractors, known as vertical <I>keiretsu</I>.
The upper tier of well-known names rests on a thick pile of shock-absorbing
factories and sweatshops, parts-makers that go bankrupt in large numbers
in times of economic shifts and reappear making different items. Their credit
needs are looked after not by the banks but by the <I>keiretsu</I> trading
companies. These organisations, which might better be termed business brokers,
strengthen still further the system of centralised control and operate as
huge industrial information centres capable of calculating risk in nearly
every area of economic activity. <BR>
<BR>
The enforcement of credit rights is more or less accepted as a fact of nature
by Japanese businessmen. But one example of credit denial was spectacularly
demonstrated by the Lion's Oil case in the summer of 1984. A maverick entrepreneur
saw a potential fortune in importing refined oil from Singapore. There were
no official guidelines to suggest it could not be done, because neither
MITI nor the Japan's oil refiners' association had anticipated that anyone
would ever have the temerity to disturb an order based on informal agreement
whereby all refining had to take place in Japan. MITI's reaction to Lion's
Oil experimentation was instantaneous: its domestic credit lines were cut.
And such was the ministry's influence in Singapore, its fiat was enforced
there too. <BR>
<BR>
Japan's authorities have had the advantage of not being held back by theory
as they tried to face the challenge of limited scarce resources. In applying
credit ordering they have simply followed methods that worked in practice.
They derive their legitimacy in the eyes of the business world from the
fact that they have always been able to make things go around, which is
why they cannot afford to let even small financial institutions go bankrupt.
<BR>
<BR>
Japan's extraordinary industrial interdependence has all but eliminated
any parties that voice their own, conflicting, ideas about what constitutes
economic reality. As a result the mandarins have frequently accomplished
feats that westerners would automatically believe impossible. In the second
half of the '80s, during the so-called bubble economy, Japan's large corporations
had access to nearly free capital as the doubling or tripling of real estate
values appeared to justify the rise of Japanese equities to astronomical
levels, and vice versa. The common assumption among western commentators,
governments and businessmen was that this was due to waves of wild speculation
by independent investors, but such a view only highlights the systematic
misinterpretation of Japanese economic reality. Speculators were exploiting
the situation, to be sure, but they were marginal and many were ruined.
<BR>
<BR>
What Japan experienced was not a bubble in the accepted meaning of the term.
The bubble never burst and the authorities, initiators of the bubble-blowing,
managed a gradual and controlled deflation. It began in 1985, when the MOF
implicitly encouraged banks to increase their lending significantly. Until
then year-on-year growth in Japanese bank lending had roughly tracked that
of nominal GNP, but it suddenly soared to much higher levels. Between 1986
and 1991 total bank lending doubled. At the peak of the bubble, land in
Tokyo and three adjoining suburban prefectures was worth as much as all
land in the us, which is 26 times bigger, plus the net worth of all companies
listed on the New York stock exchange. Price-earnings ratios on the Tokyo
stockmarket climbed in this period to between 4 and 6 times their level
in London and New York. <BR>
<BR>
Such huge additions to the paper wealth of Japan's large corporations, created
in the absence of whistle-blowing from within the bureaucratic/business
elite, were used as collateral for a variety of financing methods which
effectively brought the real cost of capital down to practically nothing.
Such methods - equity warrant bonds on the Euromarket were a favourite
- enabled industry to offset the dire effects of the huge yen appreciation
as it launched the largest wave of plant and equipment investment in history.
Credit ordering operations during the bubble accelerated the steady transfer
of wealth from the household to the industrial sector. The bubble was fed
by family savings that found their way to the stockmarket through insurance
companies and trust banks. After the mandarins decided on a guided deflation
and the market shrunk dramatically, Japanese households and financial intermediaries
saw trillions of yen wiped out, but industry still possesses the assets
that these investments financed. <BR>
<BR>
Today Japan's financial system is beset with problems as a result of unpayable
loans dating from the bubble period, combined with global economic sluggishness
that has caused huge overcapacity. But what should hold the attention of
the world's economists is the extraordinary story, not of its problems,
but of its survival. Japan's financial mandarins, financiers and top industrialists
have so much informal control over the economy that they were able to insulate
horrendous inflation in capital assets from the consumer economy and then
prevent economic collapse when the stockmarket lost over a third of its
value in six months. To top it all, they have until now staved off the collapse
of a banking system that is technically bankrupt, saddled as it is with
the equivalent of perhaps a trillion dollars or more in problem loans (no
one knows exactly -- the semi-official figure has grown from 10 trillion
to 40 trillion yen). And while there has been talk of a Japanese banking
crisis, it is not a genuine crisis of the kind leading to fundamental reforms
in the way an economy is managed. <BR>
<BR>
So why is Japan's credit ordering not better known as an institution, and
why do Japan's leaders not explicitly acknowledge its existence? Part of
the answer is that the Japanese economy would be undermined if its built-in
hierarchical preferences were made official, and thereby a target for potential
protest. <BR>
<BR>
Firms that took part in the original bubble-blowing were rewarded by systematic
compensation, paid for by securities houses as a hedge against major losses.
When this became known it caused a scandal, showing that important aspects
of Japan's credit ordering must be kept out of sight if it is to survive.
Another reason why the institution is not acknowledged explicitly must be
the lack of a conceptual language with which the Japanese can explain it
to themselves. In the absence of an ongoing public debate about social and
political desirables, Japanese explanations are never forced to reach a
level of realism. Academics, media commmentators and officialdom in Japan
excel in forcing round pegs into square holes as they explain developments
almost entirely in terms of conventional market-centred economics. But imperfections
of the market -- to use orthodox terminology for privileged access to resources
and buyers -- are so omnipresent in Japan that the market can only perform
a subsidiary function. <BR>
<BR>
The Japanese market is an administered market. Prices, not mainly dependent
on supply and demand, are set by sellers on the basis of schemes that serve
a goal other than economic efficiency. At the lower levels, market forces
tend to be more significant but competition remains highly controlled. In
sectors affected by rapidly developing technology, corporate rivalry is
sometimes actively stimulated and can become fierce, but when the controlling
agents have decided that &quot;excessive competition&quot; is harmful to
the industrial order, pressure is exerted for the parties concerned to accept
existing market shares. Incentive structures in Japanese industry deviate
widely from what is taken for granted in mainstream economics. The main
bodies animating Japan's economy frequently behave with utter disregard
for conventional market considerations. While profitmaking is ultimately
considered desirable, it has in practice not been a primary concern for
the large <I>keiretsu</I> corporations. <BR>
<BR>
The Japanese economy should exhilarate economists, since it could throw
light on old controversies in their field and inspire new ideas. Their most
important conclusion should be that sound economic theory cannot accept
the market as the universally pivotal institution of economies. But orthodoxy
and its sustaining institutions are stronger than the human thirst for knowledge.
Stymied by their trained incapacity to understand an economy in which the
market does not regulate production, all but a handful of economists have
turned their backs on the second largest industrial power in the world,
a neglect that can be confirmed by going through the indices of economic
theoretical works or textbooks. <BR>
<BR>
Japan's credit ordering has major international repercussions. One of its
consequences is that several areas of industry are reserved at an early
stage in their development to become a Japanese monopoly in the future,
as they are unlikely to attract US or European investments. Credit ordering
has also become a dominant factor in the geopolitically critical US-Japan
relationship. Japanese planners have enjoyed a great advantage from US policies
inspired by free trade ideology, while at the same time depending heavily
on an American protective diplomatic and strategic shield. Japan would not
have been such a successful industrial power had the US not accepted its
walled-off financial system and the rapid expansion of Japanese shares in
its own market, to the considerable disadvantage of American industry. <BR>
<BR>
During the Cold War the bilateral bargain consisted of Japan constituting
what former prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone once called an &quot;unsinkable
aircraft-carrier&quot; moored off the coasts of the Soviet Union and China.
This function has become significantly less compelling as an argument for
American indulgence of Japanese methods. <BR>
<BR>
A new bargain has been struck, rooted in the discovery by the Reagan administration
that Japan would finance the US budget deficit. In the late '80s the MOF
ordered institutional investors to continue buying US treasury bonds, notwithstanding
predictably huge exchange rate losses. According to some estimates, the
US financial system is dependent on Japan for roughly 10% of its credit
needs, as American banks also borrow short-term from Japanese banks, and
MOF &quot;guidance&quot; plays a decisive part in keeping down US interest
rates. In turn, to accommodate the desires of the MOF, in August 1995 the
US treasury secretary helped engineer a temporary reversal in the yen's
rise against the dollar. This new bargain is unlikely to ensure a stable
relationship, as the forces involved are too volatile and the two governments
cannot openly discuss its details. Future officials in Washington may not
understand it and misjudge it. And the American authorities already have
doubts about the soundness of Japan's financial system, as realisation dawns
about its extraordinary character. <BR>
<BR>
Japan's financial mandarins face being caught in a horrible dilemma. They
know that they cannot make urgently needed adjustments to industrial and
financial structures without diminishing their own control over these structures.
But the assertion that Japan's officials are currently being defeated &quot;by
the market&quot; are, to put it mildly, premature. The majority of economists
will never get Japan straight, because market-centred economics is a faith.
But for those who want to study how a war economy works in peacetime, for
the foreseeable future Japan is likely to remain the ideal laboratory.<BR>

<H2>RELIEF INC </H2>
<H4>A battle for the soul of the aid industry is being fought as it moves
on from high street jumble sales and collecting tins to become an fully
fledged industry, says Nick Cater </H4>
In flowing robes and suits they came from every part of the world to discuss
the future of their business, a multinational with 128 million workers and
a fast-growing annual turnover of around $19 billion in 163 countries from<BR>
America to Zimbabwe. <BR>
<BR>
But the hundreds of managers gathering in Geneva in December had no profit
forecasts to read. Instead, at the quadrennial conference of the International
Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the packed agenda covered war and hunger,
refugees and disease and how to help the 250 million people affected every
year by conflict, famine and flood. <BR>
<BR>
The movement is the world's most experienced, extensive humanitarian network.
Its unique role is recognised by governments. Yet alongside fundamental
principles of humanity and neutrality, it is increasingly run like a major
global enterprise with professional marketers, accountants and managers,
taskforces and strategic business plans. <BR>
<BR>
While the new professionalism is to be applauded, however, it is part of
the struggle now raging for the soul of the aid industry. For although the
relief agencies have much to learn from business, their work involves ethical
decisions which need values and principles to back them up. In many cases
the market model is irrelevant since &quot;consumers&quot; are the poor
and powerless and decisions are made by people giving the money, not taking
it. As charities seeking efficiency become like companies and companies
seeking the &quot;halo effect&quot; offer aid, both must be keenly honest
about where their respective strengths lie and must find new ways of working
together if we are to get aid which is both low-cost and purposeful. <BR>
<BR>
Like other industries the aid business is evolving fast and becoming increasingly
complex, the greatest change of all being the growing market for disasters.
Take the intricacy of a Washington-funded deployment of an operation involving
the US Army and a commercial Californian contractor, Portable Water Supply
Systems (PWSS), to provide clean water in Zaire at the height of the 1994
cholera emergency. The contractor worked closely with the UN and non-governmental
organisations (NGOS) and was vigorous in delivering water and promoting
its success. The water company said it had halted a cholera epidemic and
saved 140,000 lives at a cost of seven cents per life saved, claims which
probably irritated relief agencies present in the camps at Goma. <BR>
<BR>
Global television channels such as CNN International have helped force disasters
onto domestic political agendas. With conflict more visible, emergency aid
is booming: at least 5.8% or $3.2 billion of overseas development assistance
goes on emergencies, and the figure could be as much as $8 billion. In 1971
OECD emergency aid was $200 million; in 1994, $1 billion went on Rwanda
alone. <BR>
<BR>
The average number of people affected by disasters is growing by roughly
10 million a year. War is a new field: until 1989 the UN and most aid agencies
avoided battlefields but flak-jacketed aid workers now see plenty of action.
In 1994, there were some 50 conflicts to choose from which killed around
250,000 people and left more than 40 million refugees and displaced people.
For the moment the aid industry receives a minimal amount of media scrutiny
yet in this all-but-unregulated market the mistakes do not just die, their
corpses can end up on the evening news as evidence that agencies should
be given more money. <BR>
<BR>
These increasingly demanding situations have ended the age of the charity
amateur, <BR>
calling for injections of commercial experience and instincts in the relief
world just as it has in privatised industries, health, education, social
welfare and even the police. Such developments take place against a background
of deregulation as governments effectively privatise aid by channeling functions
from the state to agencies and private companies, and the creation of a
market in which diverse relief providers compete for contracts. <BR>
<BR>
Some relief agencies subcontract work to others. The UN High Commissioner
for Refugees, for example, employed charities to run camps for Rwandan refugees
during the 1994 refugee crisis and paid commercial firms to truck their
food. Indeed, UN agencies are building massive rosters of accredited private
suppliers for services such as nutrition advice and goods such as blankets.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Companies work with charities </B><BR>
<BR>
Some smaller NGOS service the needs of larger bodies, like the high-profile
M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res which takes grants from the EU's
Humanitarian Office for work in the Caucasus or former Yugoslavia. Suppliers
to the US Agency for International Development have formed their own lobby
group. And in Europe, national Red Cross societies coordinate bids for EU
funds through their own Brussels office. <BR>
<BR>
Many others have trading companies, mail-order firms or retail empires.
Oxfam UK's 850 shops selling secondhand clothes and &quot;fair trade&quot;
goods from developing countries are part of a trading arm which raised almost
20% of the charity's &#163;100 million ($154 million) turnover in the year
1994-5. And the global greeting card sales of the UN Children's Fund made
a profit of $63.4 million in 1993-4. <BR>
<BR>
The transformation is not going unresisted. The practice of agencies performing
set services for a fee rather than raising and spending their own cash,
for example, has been furiously denounced. &quot;The emergence of a media-dependent
international rescue and crisis management industry is degrading the quality
of humanitarian space,&quot; complained Nick Stockton, Oxfam UK and Ireland
relief coordinator, at an aid conference last year. &quot;The commercial
necessity to portray contractual achievement, harnessed by the [developed
world's] political demand for triumphant televisual humanitarian interventions,
helps fashion a contract culture where success is imperative. Thus, even
while the collective impact of the new humanitarian industry falls below
established international humanitarian minimum standards, accountability
for this, by apparent mutual agreement, goes <BR>
unremarked and disregarded.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Stockton, arguing that markets are incapable of meeting universal values,
went on to condemn the &quot;designer flags, T-shirts, watches, flak jackets
and other branded apparel of the new humanitarian workers&quot; and suggested
that Rwanda, where agencies jostled for a high television profile amid a
growing contract culture, showed the need for some sort of independent aid
inspectorate. <BR>
<BR>
There are efforts to improve standards: several years ago, a group of agencies
introduced a simple 10-point code of conduct for disaster relief asserting
the primacy of aid over politics, independence from governments, respect
for any local culture or economy and involvement of local personnel. Now
there are moves to take that further, for example by introducing standardisation
of disaster kits and procedures. Every part of the aid market, however,
has new teams refusing to play by the rules. <BR>
<BR>
In Goma, for example, a medical free-for-all allowed rampant cholera to
build swift resistance to most available drugs. Controls on drug use, although
hard to impose in the chaos of different aid agencies, would have saved
more lives but equally might have prompted rows about clinical freedom and
protests against &quot;protectionism&quot; by pharmaceutical suppliers.
<BR>
<BR>
Other business-related dilemmas abound. Companies which make landmines,
devices that continue wounding the public years after a conflict subsides,
are logically also good at locating and defusing them. But it sticks in
the craw of some observers when former landmine manufacturers such as Britain's
Royal Ordnance profit by winning valuable clearance contracts from relief
agencies, against competition from anti-mine campaigners such as the Halo
Trust. The UN children's agency UNICEF has just joined the UNHCR in refusing
to do business with companies that make or distribute landmines or related
components. Hunting Technical Services, rural development subsidiary of
the British firm Hunting pPLC, last year pulled out of an EU-funded food-for-work
contract in mine-strewn Cambodia after protests about a weapon made by another
subsidiary, Hunting Engineering. Despite insisting that the weapon - a Gulf
War &quot;airstrip buster&quot; bomb with integral anti-vehicle mines -
was nothing like the anti-personnel mines targeted by campaigners, the firm
pulled out of Cambodia with little argument. <BR>
<BR>
Just as aid agencies adopt business practices, many businesses look for
the halo effect of charity links to burnish their corporate image and increase
sales. One classic spin-off is the affinity credit card, now raising money
for everything from US wildlife to political prisoners. The advertising
industry is the latest halo recruit. The HelpAd scheme from the Red Cross,
looking to raise $500 million or more, offers brands the synergy of advertising
on the packaging of complimentary products such as corn flakes on milk or
toys on nappy packs. Charter clients include Richard Branson's Virgin, American
Express, SmithKline Beecham and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. <BR>
<BR>
Mike Kiernan of the US agency umbrella body InterAction notes that dynamic
sponsorship deals by American companies and agencies, such as CARE and the
coffee firm Starbucks, help charities build public support when government
funding is fragile. He says: &quot;US relief and development organisations
are catching up with environment and population groups and becoming far
more sophisticated in social marketing and corporate partnerships, and are
looking to business for support.&quot; Business is looking back at them.
The Washington-based Business for Social Responsibility has 800 corporate
members, from AT&amp;T to Federal Express, Honeywell and Time Warner. <BR>
<BR>
Even with rising corporate sponsorship, the largest proportion of aid comes
not from local jumble sales or collecting tins, which raised about $5.4
billion in 1994, but from governments sending cash overseas, looking to
buy influence, maintain friends in power and subsidise exports as well as
help the disadvantaged. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Japan's generosity eclipses the West </B><BR>
<BR>
The developed countries that make up the OECD together provide up to 95%
of all aid. The most recent figures for official development assistance
show 1994 spending of $59 billion, up from $56 billion in 1993 but down
from $60.6 billion in 1992. Generosity is fading: in 1993, developed states
gave just 0.3% of OECD gross domestic product, a 20-year low. Among donors
only Sweden, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands exceed the UN's long-standing
target of 0.7% of GDP. While aid from the US is faltering and EU aid is
expanding, Japan has become the largest national donor. <BR>
<BR>
On average, between a quarter and half of OECD aid is fully tied to spending
by the recipient on donor goods and services, although few go as far as
Luxembourg where project implementation is the <I>de facto </I>monopoly
of a commercial firm Lux-Development. The OECD itself reckons that tied
aid was on average 15% overpriced, a $2.7 billion annual windfall for donor-country
companies. <BR>
<BR>
The first conference dedicated to the business opportunities of this multi-billion-dollar
market took place in Cyprus in November, where procurement chiefs from major
agencies explained how to tender for contracts in sectors as diverse as
food, clothing, construction, medicines, transport and communications. Before
the conference the UN's London representative, Alexander Borg Oliver, said
opportunities for the private sector were enormous. <BR>
<BR>
So enormous that Geneva's vast Palexpo complex will provide the venue for
World Aid '96 in September, offering the emergency aid business its first
trade fair and conference rolled into one. George Reid of World Aid '96,
himself an aid veteran, warns of a tough new world for charities, especially
with competition prompted by privatisation. <BR>
<BR>
The latter has picked up pace as governments see a need for organisations
which can take on tough jobs without complaint, often replacing military
forces which carry their own political limitations and heavy costs. When
aid agencies proved reluctant to get shot at driving trucks through Bosnia,
Britain's Overseas Development Administration (ODA) hired Crown Agents -
once a government department, now a public corporation on its way to privatisation
- to do the job instead. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Humanitarian aid is the growth industry of the '90s,&quot; says Andy
Bearpark, the ODA's head of emergency aid. &quot;Our use of NGOS has expanded
because they are [now] far more professional and produce better work. The
cost-effectiveness is positive but the problem is that they can lose something
of the [old] NGO ethos and ability to reach the grassroots. We also use
British businesses for certain jobs that might once have been the role of
NGOS because those companies were cost-effective and better.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Private enterprise is better prepared for such a role than many may imagine.
Company consciences were awakened by the green movement and the US fashion
for mission statements and ethical standards. Today, many companies are
moving from environmental awareness to social welfare, education, health
and more. The tasks involved include US firms teaching trainees to read
and a charge-card company fostering tourism skills in eastern Europe. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Trade-off between efficiency and halo effect </B><BR>
<BR>
Companies are being forced to reconsider these issues because pressures
of technology and communications will increasingly make all products similarly
fault-free, high-performance, low-cost and custom-made. When products are
identical, little is left to distinguish brands other than intangible, non-economic
factors such as values. <BR>
<BR>
David Logan, of the London consultancy Corporate Citizenship International,
advises multinationals on corporate responsibility. He argues that companies
operating in the developing world should think in broad terms about their
responsibilities. &quot;In developing countries, companies have a short-term
direct self interest in ensuring a healthy workforce, prosperous communities
and stable societies. In Aids and family planning these interests are obvious,
since the cost of not taking these issues seriously can be seen immediately,&quot;
he says. <BR>
<BR>
Logan argues that aid agencies must become more businesslike by working
with companies as partners. People outside business do not know enough about
creating markets and selling a variety of different products, be it soft
drinks or safe sex. &quot;India needs a massive campaign right now about
Aids. Who would do it better - the government or Coca-Cola? The answer is
obvious.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The involvement of big business is being encouraged by the World Bank. It
has joined a series of transatlantic meetings and video conferences with
multinational members of the London-based Prince of Wales Business Leaders'
Forum. Big-name participants include Coca-Cola, 3M, British Gas, Cable &amp;
Wireless and IBM. One project being examined in some detail is BP's work
on small-scale social development in Colombia. In this programme, BP has
sought to sustain health, education and social welfare services in a region
125 km north- east of Bogata, where the government has little impact. The
company and the bank are considering collaboration on a childcare centre
at Tauramena in Casanare province, site of BP's oil and gas exploration,
where incomes are low, unemployment is typically high and guerrillas active.
<BR>
<BR>
Chris Marsden, of BP's international community affairs department, says:
&quot;Governments are tending to do less, which creates opportunities for
partnerships of growing importance between the private sector and NGOs.
What BP does may be regarded as enlightened self interest but it is done
for business reasons. We are hardnosed about it. It is part of what we call
our licence to operate from the local community. This is particularly important
in developing countries where we are a major factor in the national economy
and the local community.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He says the firm has skills which give advantages over NGOS: &quot;We are
efficient managers - our guys in Colombia can turn round a micro-enterprise
project in seven days that might take an NGO seven months if not years.
Some companies have charitable foundations and a lot of us firms take a
philanthropic point of view but we believe in demonstrating the business
case. We certainly see the results.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In Namibia, mining firm Rossing Uranium saw the way the wind was blowing
in 1979 and started its own charity. Some $30 million later the Rossing
Foundation is fully independent and raises money from governments, the EU
and other aid agencies to spend on small-scale projects in education, training,
health, enterprise and farming. Its director David Godfrey, a former officer
in a British Gurkha regiment, offers his ideas for multinationals with a
mission: &quot;Things need to change and the best way forward is to combine
the financial discipline of big business, in my case a multinational, with
the sensitivity of a development organisation. Multinationals... can afford
it. It's their duty. Lobby your local companies, demand a humanitarian return
for your shares.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Pitfalls of aid profit </B><BR>
<BR>
Of course some firms do not want a mission, they want cash. In Japan a price-fixing
scandal has just been uncovered involving major companies exploiting the
government aid budget, at $11.26 billion the world's largest. Japan's Fair
Trade Commission fined 37 companies - including Kanematsu, Mitsubishi, Mitsui,
Itochu, Sumitomo, Nissho Iwai, Tomen, Nichimen and Marubeni - just over
$1.5 million for running an illegal bid-rigging cartel since 1987 to exploit
tied aid. <BR>
<BR>
Purist aid agencies continue to stress the value of unbusiness-like values
like honesty, justice and human rights, while insisting that they are responsive
to both donors at home and &quot;beneficiaries&quot; in the field. But how
can they out-perform the private firms that will increasingly compete with
them for aid contracts? <BR>
<BR>
One way would be to show that they can also make markets work. In the &quot;market&quot;
of northern Iraq, for example, &quot;customers&quot; or displaced people
are being given vouchers to &quot;buy&quot; capital goods (livestock, building
materials), albeit through a single supplier, Britain's Save The Children
Fund, with a grant from the government Overseas Development Agency. The
next step is obvious: how long will it be before these clients are guaranteed
a choice of aid agency to deliver what they need? <BR>

<td valign=top align=left><H2>GLOBAL LEADERS FOR TOMORROW </H2>
<BR>
As the years' cumulative number of Global Leaders for Tomorrow reaches 500,
it is possible to draw a breath and look back with some satisfaction at
a project well in its stride. Four years on, its ideals remain exactly the
same as they were at the beginning: to identify the new generation of men
and women at or near the peak of their careers in business, finance, politics
and the public sector. Global Leaders for Tomorrow have been selected on
a number of strict criteria: they must be 42 or younger, they must already
be in a clear position of responsibility, they must have multifarious interests
and talents and they must have demonstrated that they are genuine players
in the global community. Those who have demonstrated their abilities in
a number of fields - such as in both public and private sectors - are given
especial weight. <BR>
<BR>
Over the years the selection process has been rigorous, and remains so.
As in previous years, a great number of nominations were received from member
companies of the World Economic Forum, from friends at Forum meetings, from
readers of World Link and from detailed, expert, independent research. But
this year it has been particularly welcome to see so many nominations made
by former GLT titleholders themselves. Nominations were weighed up and debated
by the Forum's executive board and World Link's editorial board, and selection
was continued by an external committee of senior public and business figures.
 <BR>
<BR>
The project was initiated by the World Economic Forum and has been made
possible with the help of Donald Keogh, former president of The Coca-Cola
Company, and Ferdinand Pi&euml;ch, chairman of Volkswagen AG. <BR>
<BR>
If there is one major change in composition of the group over the years,
it is that the number of women has almost doubled to 24 this year from 13
in 1994. In January 1993, World Link rather despondently wrote: &quot;More
women will undoubtedly be leaders in the coming decades, but many of those
individuals are still working a notch or two below the global leaders.&quot;
With high profile and talented leaders like Enron Development Corporation
chairman Rebecca Mark, Irene Saez, the mayor of Chacao in Venezuela, and
Ugandan politician Winnie Byanyima, this has started to change and as predicted
women have begun to reach the top of the corporate ladder. <BR>
<BR>
The geographical spread of this year's Global Leaders for Tomorrow is as
diverse as always, with leaders from countries as far apart as Ukraine,
Peru and Mongolia. Socio-cultural differences within the group remain, however,
and this is reflected in the make-up of the leaders. Western Europe and
North America have slightly larger contingents than usual (28 from each
continent) which continues to reflect the entrepreneurial spirit in those
areas and more specifically the number of high-tech companies represented,
which traditionally have younger chief executives. Nevertheless, Latin America
is growing in strength with nine Global Leaders for Tomorrow this year.
Other emerging markets are well represented but the social mores of south-east
Asia, where seniority in many cases equals age, still pose problems for
the young potential leader. It would be difficult to imagine a Marc Andreessen
or Lars Windhorst in south-east Asia, for example. The rapid changes now
taking place within these markets may demand the new perspectives and inputs
that younger leaders can bring to problems, or risk damaging regional prospects.
<BR>
<BR>
The 100 people in this new generation of Global Leaders for Tomorrow join
the 100 from 1995 and 1994 respectively and 200 from 1993. Just as their
colleagues from previous years, they have been invited to take part in a
special programme at this year's Annual Meeting at Davos. In addition, the
leaders will be involved in World Economic Forum summits throughout the
year. It is gratifying to see the enthusiasm that has grown up among the
special programme for Chinese Global Leaders for Tomorrow at the annual
Beijing meeting. The hope is that this group of participants will strengthen
and will continue to develop into a network of individuals who can reinforce
each others' strengths and create a vigorous dialogue across the continents
of the world. <BR>
<BR>
The strength and vigour of what is now a 500-strong group of Global Leaders
for Tomorrow will hopefully be demonstrated in Davos and throughout the
year by their continuing achievements and efforts, even if the context,
the role or even the sphere of activity changes over the coming years.<BR>
 <p><br>
<H3>GLOBAL LEADERS FOR TOMORROW</H3> 

<H4>World Link and the World Economic Forum, for the fourth year, profile 100
men and women from around the world who have made their mark and will lead
business, finance, politics, public and non-profit sectors and academia
into the 21st century </H4>
<P>MADE POSSIBLE WITH THE HELP AND INVOLVEMENT OF DONALD KEOUGH,
FORMER PRESIDENT 
OF THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND FERDINAND PIECH, CHAIRMAN OF VOLKSWAGEN AG

<H4>A looming macroeconomic crisis looks set to hamper India's attempts
to achieve its enormous potential </H4>
<I>By Meenakshi Behara </I><BR>
<BR>
Early in January, Singapore's elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew spoke to Indian
industrialists in New Delhi and exhorted them to push harder for growth
and open more willingly to foreign investment. Lee believed India could
be on its way to a consistent annual growth rate of over 7%. Lee's optimism
was provoked by both India's immense potential and the recent performance
of the economy. <BR>
<BR>
By early December last year, government economists had started talking of
a possible 6% GDP growth rate in the current fiscal year. Coming after the
6.2% growth recorded in the previous year, that appears very impressive.
Contributing to this year's exceptional performance has been the consistent
record of industry: by the end of September industrial growth was running
above 11%. Tight control on monetary expansion has helped keep inflation
reined in: by India's standards current inflation rates of under 7% look
good. Government revenues are buoyant, indirect tax revenues were up almost
17% for the period up to November and direct tax revenues rose 28%. <BR>
<BR>
But there is a flip side. Agriculture's performance has been lacklustre.
Current independent estimates suggest that agriculture could witness a major
slowdown and food production may grow by less than 10%. Tidings on the trade
and external front are also bleak. The trade deficit for the period from
April to November nearly doubled over corresponding months in 1994. The
rupee has been under considerable pressure since August and has effectively
depreciated over 10%. And foreign debt has been estimated at up to $109
billion. <BR>
<BR>
Much of the blame is naturally being placed at the government's door. Its
macroeconomic stabilisation policy is in tatters with Prime Minister Narasimha
Rao's government trying to attack problems through government spending.
There is widespread disillusionment with his government's record on corruption,
as well as problems of law and order and a general breakdown in administration.
The result has been a precipitous fall in Rao's popularity. His hope, no
doubt, is that spending programmes will enable him to buy votes come the
general elections expected in April, though clearly that may fail. A very
real prospect, however, is that the government may find itself faced with
a macroeconomic crisis of even larger proportions than it inherited in 1991.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Public sector reforms not working </B><BR>
<BR>
The government's record on generating revenues has been questioned. One
recent study suggests that tax revenues as a proportion of GDP have actually
declined despite the introduction of extensive tax reforms and a rationalisation
of the tax administration, although economists understood such a decline
in the initial years of reform, the hint of a trend is disconcerting. <BR>
<BR>
Not that the government has had much success in improving non-tax revenues.
The much-touted reform of the public sector in a bid to generate savings
from the government sector has not really worked. In 1992 the government
set out a major public sector divestment programme, intended both to raise
government revenues and impart a new dynamism into the sector. Neither of
these goals has been achieved to any significant degree. <BR>
<BR>
The dismantling of the industrial policy regime and the abolition of state
monopolies in certain sectors exposed public sector undertakings (PSUs)
to greater competition. &quot;This exerted a pressure on PSUs to tone up
their performance. I think Steel Authority of India is an excellent example
of this,&quot; notes Rakesh Mohan, economic adviser in the industry ministry.
<BR>
<BR>
Unarguably, aggregate PSU profits went up. But the main contributors have
stayed almost the same: the petroleum sector monopolies, the state electricity
monopoly, Bharat Heavy Electricals, the power generation monolith National
Thermal Power Corporation and the telecommunications monopolies. But the
laggards remained and revenues from the public sector are still an insignificant
portion of total revenues of the government. <BR>
<BR>
Strapped for increased revenues, the government's borrowing programme has
become much larger than intended. The huge government borrowing programme
for the fiscal year 1995-96 has pushed real interest rates to a new high
of over 10%, up from 3% last year. It has also drained the markets of liquidity.
Industry is feeling the heat. <BR>
<BR>
Even as higher interest rates worsen the government's fiscal situation,
rampant populism has pushed subsidies and other giveaways to a new high.
Capital expenditures have been the first victims in the drive to maintain
fiscal deficit targets. Over the past five years, government's capital expenditure
as a proportion of GDP has fallen from 6% to 3.5% according to one recent
study. Budgetary support to the India's five-year central plan, particularly
the core sectors, has been slashed by an estimated 15% in the current year.
In real terms this could be the lowest level of capital expenditure so far
in post-independence Indian economic history. Reports suggest that social
sectors have been spared further cuts but even in this sector real spending
has fallen over the past five years, not counting any possible eve-of-poll
handouts. <BR>
<BR>
Core sector projects could be seriously impaired. As project funding is
cut, an estimated 80 railway projects, 30 coal mining projects and 10 power
projects are already behind schedule and could slip further. Cost overruns,
which are currently 40%, will be aggravated. <BR>
<BR>
The government wants to believe that the private sector, both indigenous
and foreign, has taken up the slack in investment. In fact, nothing could
be further from the truth. Procedural snags continue to bedevil investments
in core sectors. Despite the simplification of procedures, private investors
still need about 45 different clearances from bureaucrats to get started.
In areas like the privatisation of the roads and ports, a number of amendments
to existing legislation that are essential to facilitate private sector
participation have not been passed. In the power sector, bungling in the
Enron case (see page 135) has damaged the country's reputation with prospective
foreign investors. The telecommunications sector is also problematical (see
page 144) thanks to what appears to be an ever-shifting official position.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The problems of party dissent </B><BR>
<BR>
Despite the most sincere intentions, the government seems to have been at
a loss to decide how to proceed. This is often attributed to Rao's ambivalent
stand on crucial issues in the face of intraparty dissent in the Congress
Party. <BR>
<BR>
In industry, however, there has been an impressive show of investment interest.
Since mid-1991 investment intentions indicated to the government have amounted
to over $150 billion. Foreign direct investment approvals have totted up
to $12 billion. But actual investments still run at under $1 billion and
there seems to be little urgency to get the inflow of investments to rise
sharply. Though central government clearances have become nearly automatic,
state level delays can be frustrating. <BR>
<BR>
The other major area of reform, the external sector, has continued to show
significant growth. From the months of April to November last year, exports
registered an impressive 24.5% growth and reached $19.8 billion. For the
politicians, people like commerce minister P Chidambaram who is one of the
architects of India's free trade policy, these figures are a vindication
of the new policy regime that was unveiled in 1991. &quot;I had said then
it would take 18 months for any new policy to bear fruit. Clearly liberalisation
has even accelerated the rate of growth of exports.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Dreams of soaring exports </B><BR>
<BR>
Chidambaram has often cited a dream $75 billion export target for the year
2000. From the $31 billion this year, this target would require sustained
20% compound annual growth rate. He acknowledges difficulties but says it
is a fair target, &quot;that kind of growth is possible having regard to
the forces that have been unleashed&quot; in recent years.* <HR WIDTH=60%>
<H3><A NAME="politics"></A>RESILIENT MR RAO </H3>
<H4>Narasimha Rao's Congress Party has held on to power since 1991 but new
political forces threaten his majority </H4>
<I>By Meenakshi Behara </I><BR>
<BR>
The most noteworthy aspect of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's government
has been its amazing ability to survive. It was after the brutal assassination
of Rajiv Gandhi that Rao came to power, with a huge sympathy vote for the
Congress Party in the second round of polling in 1991. He then led India's
first post-poll minority Congress government and seemed to have only a slender
chance of survival. <BR>
<BR>
But Rao has confounded most political observers. His grasp of <I>Realpolitik</I>
has helped him buy support from regional parties, engineer defections from
others and keep his own flock together despite constant dissent. <BR>
<BR>
However, apart from an impressive political victory in Punjab, Rao's record
of governance has been lacklustre. His government's ineptitude in handling
one crisis culminated in the December 1992 demolition of a shrine in a small
town in Uttar Pradesh, believed to be the birthplace of Lord Rama by Hindu
zealots. The incident triggered some ugly sectarian violence and left the
country with an alarming legacy of social and political polarisation. <BR>
<BR>
Although Congress has not quite vacated the secular middle ground, it has
done little about the growth of both Hindu and Muslim religious fundamentalism.
Kashmir remains a problem because Rao has lacked the courage to confront
Pakistan over its alleged role in sponsoring terrorism in the valley. The
law and order situation across the country has deteriorated because of the
nexus between politicians, bureaucrats and criminals that is now acknowledged
even in government reports. <BR>
<BR>
That Rao's government has managed to survive despite everything underscores
the absence of any very credible alternative. The non-Congress government
was a rag-tag coalition of various political hues that came to power in
1989 under VP Singh and lasted less than a year. But political observers
are not convinced that Rao will stay in power after the general elections
expected in April. Clearly he has been preparing for the elections since
last August. He has directed his government to throw all fiscal prudence
to the wind through populist schemes like salaries for Muslim clerics, bank
loans to women and midday meals for children, although it is hard to know
what kind of electoral impact they may have. At the same time, a number
of scandals involving top Congress politicians have surfaced, with the infrastructure
ministries in particular being viewed with cynicism and suspicion. There
are few reserves of goodwill Rao can now hope to draw on. <BR>
<BR>
Many observers believe Congress is almost totally alienated from the people
after its defeats in last year's state elections. In Maharashtra and Gujarat
in the west, Congress was routed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In
Karnataka and in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, the party was severely
mauled by Janata Dal and the Telugu Desam, two members of the National Front/Left
Front alliance often referred to as the Third Alternative. Congress now
governs states with less than a quarter of the population. <BR>
<BR>
Two new political forces seem set to share centre stage. Resurgent Hindu
nationalism represented by the BJP has emerged as the most potent political
force since 1990 and the party is now in control of the prosperous, industrially
advanced western states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan. In addition,
it holds considerable sway among the urban masses of Uttar Pradesh, a state
which accounts for almost 15% of the country's electorate. The party's recent
victory in civic elections underlined its support in the state. Simultaneously,
the party has a growing presence in the south, particularly in the states
of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. <BR>
<BR>
The other major political stream, essentially based on caste, is represented
by an alliance of the Janata Dal, Samajwadi and Bahujan Samaj parties. Originally
non-sectarian, this group has attracted the support of the Muslim community
which has rapidly veered away from Congress since 1992. It holds sway over
India's most populous, economically backward and ill-governed states: large
parts of rural Uttar Pradesh and the whole of Bihar. <BR>
<BR>
Some of the grouping's leaders are rather dubious in their commitment to
the niceties of parliamentary democracy, the electoral process and even
the rule of law. Nevertheless, the front could provide a major rallying
point for the poorer castes. Together with the Marxists in West Bengal and
Kerala and the regional parties in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, these
parties form the National Front/Left Front. <BR>
<BR>
The three-way fracture of the body politic may well yield a hung parliament,
bringing all the uncertainties of coalition politics. Congress has tried
to project itself as the only stable, centrist option but this may not be
enough to attract votes. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sonia Gandhi waits in the wings </B><BR>
<BR>
The one unused weapon in the Congress armoury is Rajiv Gandhi's Italian-born
widow Sonia. Despite a number of public denials, she has remained keenly
interested in the goings-on of the Congress Party and government and could
well be a star attraction if she ventures onto the election trail, particularly
in the Hindu &quot;cowbelt&quot; states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya
Pradesh and Rajasthan which together account for 40% of all seats in parliament.
Whether Rao will use her services is another matter. A Congress resurgence
in the north could derail the political aspirations of the less populous
but more prosperous western and southern regions (Rao's power base) and
end his hopes of continuing as prime minister if Congress wins the election.
<BR>
<BR>
Although Congress is unlikely to win a majority in the elections, other
contenders seem equally unlikely to be able to form a government on their
own. Undeniably, the other parties will do well in their core constituencies
- the Hindu vote in the case of the BJP and the poorer castes and Muslims
for Janata Dal - but a hung parliament may well be the result. <BR>
<BR>
Conventional wisdom suggests Congress may then band together with elements
of the Janata Dal-led National Front. At least in principle they share a
secular platform. Congress could count on support from the southern regional
parties and the Marxists in West Bengal and Kerala. <BR>
<BR>
<B>When cynics are realists </B><BR>
<BR>
More cynical observers have even speculated about a future coalition between
Congress and the BJP. It does seem possible that less secular elements in
Congress, perhaps including Rao himself, may push for just such an alliance.
Sitaram Yechury, a member of the politburo of the Communist Party, uses
the imagery of Hindu politics when he says: &quot;A pale saffron government
may not be entirely implausible if Narasimha Rao takes on BJP support to
form his government, in the event that he is unable to secure a majority
on his own.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The implications of another coalition for the economic reforms are now emerging.
Coalition politics did seem to work when Rao assumed office in 1991, primarily
because the enormity of the economic crisis encouraged the opposition to
be relatively constructive in parliament. But competing economic aspirations
from different coalition parties would affect the reforms. While there is
no doubt of the commitment of the Congress leadership to economic change,
the rank and file of the party still seems unsure about dismantling the
command economy. Congress derived a disproportionate share of the spoils
from the all-pervasive licensing regime of the past. Elements in Janata
Dal and the regional parties are also against reforms, for the same reasons.
A coalition of Congress, Janata Dal and the Communist Party might therefore
proceed only haltingly towards deregulation. Elements in Janata Dal will
push for open foreign investment, but a more cogent economic ideology has
yet to emerge from the party. Meanwhile, the Communist administration in
West Bengal has successfully wooed investors back to the state. The party
could become a major influence on the nation's economic policy.* <HR WIDTH=60%>
<H3>A SINGH OF THE TIMES</H3>
<H4>The man behind India's reform programme says reform's greatest success is acceptance of the need for change </H4>
<B>Finance minister Manmohan Singh has received a large amount of the credit for the dramatic economic reforms of the last four years. He spoke to World Link's Meenakshi Behara in his office in the grand North Block of the government buildings in New Delhi in early January. </B>
<BR><BR>
What do you consider the most significant economic achievement of your government
in the last four and a half years? 
<BR><BR>
To have succeeded in changing the mindset of the people with regard to how
the economy ought to be managed. We had gone in one direction [for] 42 years
- there were lots of achievements, the economic structure was diversified
- but after a period of time we had evolved an over-bureaucratised set-up
which was counter-productive. It suppressed the creativity and underlying
productivity of our economy and polity and a major overhaul of our economic
policy framework was essential. 
<BR><BR>
When we started this was a controversial issue, but in the last four and
a half years the prime minister has been remarkably successful in hammering
out a broad national consensus [on] how the economy ought to be managed.
I think today there is great support across parties [for] more competition,
[for the idea] that the public sector does not have to be expanded, the
licensing system is not necessary, that India needs to welcome foreign investment.
<BR><BR>
Although some parties like the Bharatiya Janata Party would say that we
don't want foreign investment in [some sectors], I don't think that's really
typical of the mood of India. Politicians should be judged not by what they
say but by what they do. And by that criteria all political parties in different
states are, on economic policy issues, largely pursuing the same policy
as our government. That's the biggest achievement. 
<BR><BR>
For all of the economic achievements, there remain areas where improvement
seems to have been slow. What about the profitability of the public sector?
<BR><BR>
Structural changes are bound to take time. The Chinese have the same problem
with their public enterprises. But we have not allowed losses of public
enterprises as a proportion of GDP to become a growing problem. We have
reduced them. We have not allowed subsidies in the central budget to go
up as a proportion of GDP. We've kept them constant at about 1% of GDP.
So the trend is in the right direction although the pace may not be as fast
as we would have liked. 
<BR><BR>
Has the government addressed structural issues in the public sector? <BR>
<BR>
True, we haven't been able to do everything. But our first problem was to
calm the fears of workers in public sector enterprises. There were fears
that the whole programme would lead to large-scale unemployment and if workers
were not reassured the whole programme could be derailed. We have gone at
a rate at which society can absorb the effect of reform but we must not
underestimate the effect of divestment. The very fact that many public sector
enterprises today have the public at large as their shareholders has created
a cost consciousness and new incentives to look at profitability. Even workers
and trade unions today have different mindsets. They worry about the loss
of jobs, efficiency and profitability. Before 1991, they never thought it
was their problem. They thought that year after year they could get higher
wages. Now, for the first time, they are becoming aware that there is such
a thing as underlying productivity which will determine paying capacity.
<BR>
<BR>
What should the government do to speed private investment in infrastructure?
<BR>
<BR>
There is no single solution: problems vary from sector to sector. In power,
for example, if the state electricity boards are to retain their monopoly
of distribution, their financial health should inspire confidence among
those who generate private power. That means they must charge tariffs that
are cost-based. Or we might think of giving some high tension consuming
areas to those who produce power, like the SEBs. We have to experiment in
a country as large as ours. <BR>
<BR>
There are problems of learning by doing since we had no experience in dealing
with private investment. If we were starting again we may have done it differently:
important lessons have been learned and in the next five years we'll see
a lot more aggressive involvement of the private sector in these areas.
Getting legislatures to approve changes in policy... all of it takes time.
<BR>
<BR>
How do you react to accusations that the rupee's fall shows the failure
of your economic policy? <BR>
<BR>
There is no truth in that. The exchange rate is a price and we have to keep
prices at a level which would help our balance of payments to remain strong.
In the final analysis we have to finance our imports essentially by exports
and a sustainable inflow of capital. If we keep the exchange rate artificially
overvalued, that will do no service to India's economy. I believe we have
greatly improved the export incentives in the last four years. Before we
came to office, only 50-60% of India's imports were covered by exports.
Today about 90% of imports are covered. India is, in that sense, more self-reliant,
less vulnerable to fluctuations from abroad than before.<HR WIDTH=60%> 
<H3>ONE'S OWN COUNTRY </H3>
<H4>The Bharatiya Janata Party has a vision of a self-reliant India but
not a xenophobic one, claims its leader Advani </H4>
<B>Lal Krishna Advani MP is president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the
main rival of the ruling Congress Party in the forthcoming general elections.
To many foreign observers, the nationalistic rhetoric of the BJP raises
concerns about the breakdown of India's secular democracy and a newly hostile
attitude towards foreign investment. Interviewed by World Link's Meenakshi
Behara in the party's spartan Delhi offices, Advani was eager to display
his party's liberal economic credentials. </B><BR>
<BR>
What will be the Bharatiya Janata Party's main election plank this time?
<BR>
<BR>
I hold that today the level of political debate among the masses is such
that economic policy would be debated only in a small segment, whereas the
economic situation would be debated all over. And our stand is that the
economic situation has been very bad considering the potential of this country.
The country has not been given leadership to utilise that potential fully,
firstly because of incorrect policies and more importantly because of lack
of integrity. I regard it as singularly unfortunate that the change of policy,
the U-turn taken by the Congress Party in 1991, has been synchronised with
a series of scandals and scams which have communicated the wrong message.
It is as if these scams are due to the change in policy. I do not subscribe
to that. My party has always been of the view that the command economy strategy
the Congress inflicted on the country was not right. <BR>
<BR>
How do you summarise the Bharatiya Janata Party's economic policy? <BR>
<BR>
We are in favour of liberalisation: there are no two opinions on that. But
we focus on internal liberalisation, delicensing and doing away with unnecessary
controls and proceed more rapidly in that direction. We welcome foreign
investment but only in some areas and would be wary of this in the consumer
goods sector and in the self-employed sector. Maybe after five years this
would change. We don't want a situation in which even firms like the Tatas
are gobbled up. India can wait for [western luxury products like] Camay
soaps for a few years. <BR>
<BR>
If you were voted to power... <BR>
<BR>
There have been many foreign companies in the consumer goods sector that
have been apprehensive about what would happen to them only because one
important company [Coca-Cola] was asked to pack up and go back [by a previous
government]<B>.</B> Every party that subscribes to a parliamentary democracy
is conscious of the fact that government is a continuity. Therefore, if
there are radical changes in policy, those changes will as a rule be prospective,
not retrospective. <BR>
<BR>
Do you agree that India needs foreign investment in infrastructure? <BR>
<BR>
This emphasis in the last five years, that unless we get foreign capital
we are doomed, is misplaced. Foreign capital comes here not to benefit us.
They have no market: this is the market, it's huge. They come for their
own interests. But on the other hand a climate has been created by our own
government saying that the present economic crisis is very grim, very acute,
that unless there is foreign investment we are doomed. I don't see it this
way. <BR>
<BR>
When we talk of <I>swadeshi</I> [a Hindi word meaning &quot;of one's own
country&quot;] we essentially stress the dimensions of self-reliance, not
self-sufficiency. We have the potential and we have many overseas Indians
who are a potential source of investment. In China, the bulk of foreign
investments have come from [overseas] Chinese. <BR>
<BR>
Do you believe in international trade and the feasibility of trade-led growth?
<BR>
<BR>
My party doesn't favour isolation. We do not suffer from xenophobia. But
at the same time we feel it is wrong [to think] that unless the world led
by the IMF and World Bank helps us we have no future. In this context, the
fall in the value of the rupee in the last few months has caused great concern
and is a reflection of the failure of the government's policy. <BR>
<BR>
Does your party see India as part of the global market? <BR>
<BR>
We cannot disregard the impact of global forces and we have to be part of
the global market. But movement towards that has to be cautious. <BR>
<BR>
How will you deal with the problem of poor returns on investment in the
public sector, given the size of the investments? <BR>
<BR>
We favour disinvestment but not at the rates at which it has been done,
at throwaway prices. We were unhappy with the valuation of PSU [public sector
undertakings] shares when the first disinvestment exercise was done in 1992.
You could say that we were on a leaning curve or that there were policy
imperatives [to bridge the fiscal deficit] but somehow we feel the government
had ulterior motives in disposing of those shares at unrealistically low
prices. <BR>
<BR>
As regards return on investment, with the constraints that have been imposed
on the public sector, what do you expect? Today, they cannot submit tenders
even in telephone services. A foreign public sector company can come here
and form a nexus with an Indian private sector company, but an Indian public
sector company cannot join hands with a foreign company which can give it
technological expertise. This needs to be thought through. <HR WIDTH=60%>
<H3>POINTS OF ARRIVAL </H3>
<H4>Foreign firms are increasingly tempted to avoid joint ventures and plump
for wholly owned subsidiaries 
</H4><I>By Meenakshi Behara </I><BR>
<BR>
The strategies foreign companies develop in order to enter India are in
a state of flux. Joint ventures, which only a few years ago were the norm,
seem to be falling out of favour. The wholly owned subsidiary is increasingly
common and new hybrid methods are regularly announced. For example, Volvo's
decision to enter the Indian market did not come as a surprise, but the
mode of entry that the conservative Nordic vehicle corporation proposed
caught most observers unawares. <BR>
<BR>
Early in December, Volvo applied to the Foreign Investment Promotion Board
(FIPB) seeking permission to establish a wholly owned subsidiary which would
in turn set up two subsidiaries, one to manufacture trucks and buses and
another at a later stage to manufacture cars. The first phase of operations
is expected to entail an investment of up to $80 million. The proposal also
indicated that &quot;if all projects envisaged in the second phase of operations
materialise, the investment is expected to increase to $300 million&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
Volvo indicated that the passenger car manufacturing subsidiary (unlike
the truck-producing subsidiary) would be majority-owned by the Swedish parent
company, with a minority stake held by Indian capital. <BR>
<BR>
Close on Volvo's heels, Korean conglomerate Hyundai announced its intention
to set up a car manufacturing facility in India. Initially a wholly owned
venture, the entity expects to offer 40% of its equity to the Indian public
when it starts the second phase of its capacity expansion programme. In
an industry where conventional wisdom has always favoured tie-ups with local
manufacturers in a bid to gain overnight access to distribution and support
networks, these different approaches have attracted much interest. <BR>
<BR>
Toyota and Daihatsu are both currently considering entry strategies for
India, although Toyota's apparently unhappy experience with an Indian joint
venture in an earlier light commercial vehicle manufacturing project could
weigh heavily in the decision-making process. Sid Khanna, a managing partner
with Andersen Consulting, says: &quot;These companies have developed world-class
product and manufacturing technologies. They feel there is no reason for
them to share control. They feel they are not being properly remunerated
for what they are bringing in.&quot; Auto industry observers concede Khanna's
point of view. The global giants also bring brand equity and hardly need
an equity contribution from an Indian partner. <BR>
<BR>
<B>That was then and this is now </B><BR>
<BR>
Yezdi Malegam senior partner at SB Billimoria, part of the Ernst &amp; Young
global network, is one of India's most respected financial advisers. He
says: &quot;In the past you needed an Indian partner. In the regulatory
framework of the past, you could not get permits and licences without knowing
your way around, and the Indian partner helped with that. Now, except for
some relatively minor state government level clearances, the entire framework
is far more transparent. It obviates the need for an Indian partner.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Indian businessmen, however, point out that an Indian face can still be
an important asset. An understanding of the local ethos could ensure that
multinationals entering the country skirt round political quicksand. <BR>
<BR>
There is no hard-and-fast rule. &quot;If any project is pushed through in
what might appear an arbitrary manner, [anything] lacking in transparency
or seen as militating against overall social interests is bound to run into
trouble irrespective of whether it's wholly foreign owned or a joint venture.
It can't be rescued just because there is an Indian business involved,&quot;
says one observer. <BR>
<BR>
Denise Leonard, the head of the International Finance Corporation's south
Asia regional mission, strongly advises foreign investors to consider the
possibility of joint ventures. Speaking at the World Economic Forum's Delhi
meeting in December, she commended joint ventures because of the Indian
partners' knowledge of local business practices, market conditions and the
customer base. <BR>
<BR>
Mahindra Chugh, senior vice-president of the Industrial Credit &amp; Investment
Corporation of India, has advised a wide range of multinationals on entry
strategies. He takes the point further and advises intending investors to
&quot;carefully consider the demonstrated capabilities of many Indian joint
venture partners in the product adaptation and quality and productivity
upgrading processes that can often be the key to success in the Indian market&quot;.
Corporate advisers have suggested the joint venture route for a variety
of other reasons including the entrepreneurial mindset of many local business
families, their ability to manage Indian technical and managerial staff
and their competence in financing. <BR>
<BR>
But the growing list of foreign companies wanting to go it alone in the
Indian market suggests that they see it differently. Typically, strategic
freedom, technology and product patent protection top the list. For instance
pharmaceutical companies find the low cost of research and clinical trials,
often without stringent western safeguards, a very alluring prospect although
they need to ensure the highest levels of confidentiality. Increasingly
the high risk, cost of brand-building and equally high potential rewards
are encouraging foreign companies to choose 100% ownership. <BR>
<BR>
Even foreign companies which diluted their equity stake to 40% in their
Indian operations under the requirements of the old Foreign Exchange Regulation
Act in the '70s, and then raised their stakes again to 51% or more through
preferential equity issues, are now setting up fully owned subsidiaries
to take on new activities in India. <BR>
<BR>
One corporate adviser observes: &quot;Particularly in consumer goods industry
multinationals will typically want control and so joint ventures and partnerships
may not be the preferred route in the future - barring of course any serious
government rethinking.&quot; Even those who favour joint ventures concede
that the cultural issues are handled just as well by professional local
executives as by families. &quot;Groups like the [industrial conglomerate]
Tatas or the various multinationals that have been operating in India for
a while, such as Lever's are proof enough of this,&quot; observes Chugh.
<BR>
<BR>
In a recent example, a major European conglomerate was advised to consider
holding just 75% in its Indian subsidiary, offer 20% to the Indian public
and financial institutions and keep the balance of 5% as stock options in
order to attract the best managerial talent. Typically, new foreign entrants
face problems centring around understanding the dynamics of the Indian marketplace
and the psychology of the local workforce. Nowadays investors veer increasingly
to the view that knowledge and experience can be directly hired without
having an Indian partner anywhere in the picture. &quot;The multinational
already has access to everything else - technology, finance and a global
brand equity,&quot; notes one corporate adviser, drawing attention to the
management teams of highly successful and profitable foreign operations
in India. <BR>
<BR>
Widespread western-style technical and management education, along with
good accounting standards and corporate law, effectively ensure that multinationals'
Indian operations can be run with a high degree of operational and strategic
independence. For example, Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever's Indian operations
have had an Indian national as chief executive for the past 30 years. <BR>
<BR>
The experience of a range of high-growth, high-profit companies in industries
ranging from pharmaceuticals to precision engineering is similar. Although
Andersen's Khanna feels that management in India lacks experience in operating
within a competitive market environment, and that there is a case for the
return of expatriate Indians who often settle in well, few analysts of the
Indian business scene would agree. They point out that just as Indian expatriate
managers are often culturally out of their depth in the west, they are equally
likely to find themselves professionally out of their depth in India. <BR>
<BR>
<B>More creative, direct approach </B><BR>
<BR>
Immediate access to a well-established distribution network is often a major
reason for preferring a joint venture particularly in areas like automobiles
and consumer electronics. In fact, advisers to a major proposed automobile
start-up have suggested a creative approach to distribution that could actually
take the company closer to the consumer and avoid the dissonance associated
with a traditional automobile distribution network. <BR>
<BR>
The government is being very accommodating, whatever the strategy. &quot;We
are effectively clearing all applications except those that impinge on our
national interest or the interest of our domestic industry,&quot; notes
RK Sinha, secretary at the industry ministry. <BR>
<BR>
It is apparent that a clear-cut approach to wholly owned subsidiaries is
in the making. &quot;Increasingly there appears a feeling among India's
decision-makers that multinational entry should not be purely on the basis
of their ability to bring investible resources. This is one mistake a lot
of multinationals are making. They will have to create product and technology
development capabilities within the country. It makes sense to invite them
only if they make investments in manufacturing facilities and research and
development,&quot; says Chugh <BR>
<BR>
The FIPB has been watchful. In a bid to prevent global consumer goods giants
from swamping the Indian market via wholly owned subsidiaries, the board
clears only a specific product or product line. In addition, where a holding
company is established, it is precluded from a direct involvement in manufacturing
activities. And trading companies are still denied permission. The FIPB
is also known to have sought specific commitments that companies already
operating in India ensure that the new subsidiaries do not grow at the expense
of existing ones. <BR>
<BR>
The wholly owned subsidiary is here to stay. Malegam notes: &quot;Pure joint
ventures will gradually disappear. Foreign companies want to acquire control
and the Indian partner will find he has no role left.&quot; Then he forecasts
how things may change: &quot;In some conditions, the ideal entry strategy
may even entail acquisition of existing mid-sized Indian companies.&quot;
The advantages of a quick start-up and some sort of distribution network
aside, such a move may also become necessary to create a barrier against
a later entry by another global competitor. But with the takeover code still
in its infancy, any such move, particularly if it is hostile, could be a
messy and bitter way to commence what ought to be a long and mutually rewarding
passage through India.

<H3>LESSONS FROM ENRON</H3>
<H4>The name of US power firm has become a byword for India's resistance
to change. But no longer </H4>
No foreign project has been as controversial as US energy group Enron's
scheme to build a power station south of Bombay, in the state of Maharashtra.
The Dabhol project, under negotiation since 1992, was for a two-stage gas-fired
power plant. But the need to increase India's power-generating capacity
meant that the project was awarded in a non-competitive process that lacked
transparency. <BR>
<BR>
The Dabhol project became a political rallying cry for the Bharatiya Janata
Party/Shiv Sena grouping that seized control of the state in elections last
August. Once in power, the $2 billion project was noisily cancelled by chief
minister Manohar Joshi. In early January, however, a renegotiated deal was
announced that allowed both the state and Enron to claim success: the new
agreement lowered the tariff from Rs2.40 to Rs1.86 per unit and the total
project cost from Rs90.6 billion to Rs64.2 billion. According to Enron,
the tariff cuts are possible thanks to greater economies of scale following
an agreement to raise output and the capital cost has fallen after spinning
off a $300 million regasification plant into a separate commercial venture.
<BR>
<BR>
Despite the eventual resolution of the dispute, the Dabhol brouhaha raised
the spectre of major foreign investments being held to ransom by rival political
interests. The eventual effect may take years to assess. <BR>
<BR>
Rebecca Mark, chief executive of Enron Development Corporation, has often
been attacked for her allegedly superior approach. She is miffed at the
way &quot;the largest single foreign investor in India&quot; has been treated.
However, she is probably the best placed to advise intending investors on
what to expect when setting up a project. &quot;I wish I could say there
was some way we could have avoided this, but I honestly don't think there
was. I think that this is a kind of threshold for Indians - be it the public,
business and government - to decide whether or not reform is going to take
place or whether it's going to be business as usual. At the end of the day,
there are lessons for both of us. We certainly could never have anticipated
this kind of a reaction to have occurred but it did. It's important that
we understand these things have very serious implications and can't be brushed
aside. It has served a purpose in terms of the public because they now understand
the seriousness... of not having this type of an investment occur, particularly
in the power sector. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Caution is warranted. There are two concerns that we have. One is
the speed with which the state electricity boards and people in government
acquire the understanding of how these large transactions work so that they
can effectively deal with [foreigners]. A second area is the opposition
put forward by Indian companies who are used to a fairly protective environment
and don't wish to have different kinds of new entrants into the market.
And that resistance is fairly well entrenched because there is a great deal
of linkage between business and government both at the state and the national
levels. <HR WIDTH=60%>
<H3>IINDIA'S WANNABE'S </H3>
<H4>The relatively modern, hi-tech Bangalore and other states are seeking
to emulate the success of Singapore
</H4><I>By Meenakshi Behara </I><BR>
<BR>
Every visitor to Bangalore, the capital of Karnataka, is welcomed at the
airport with a rose. Step outside the terminal and a large hoarding welcomes
you to IBM City. An aerospace research establishment just outside the airport
serves to reinforce the high-tech image of the city that has become home
to a clutch of global giants in information technology, telecommunications,
electronics and precision engineering. Then you drive into ill-managed traffic,
learn to live with repeated power failures through the day and prepare to
return. <BR>
<BR>
<B>After dark in Bangalore's dust bowl </B><BR>
<BR>
But the late evening scene at Bangalore's airport is unbelievable. Eight
aircraft, all scheduled to leave within minutes of each other crowd an apron
that was probably designed to handle just three. The terminal building has
plenty of dust but no air-conditioning and is bursting at the seams with
passengers. Every flight out is packed with businessmen and professionals
of varied nationalities. The public address system gawks unintelligibly.
The lighting outside is so inadequate you wish you had brought a torch to
help you find the aircraft. There is one consolation, though: Bangalore's
famous draught beer is on tap at the terminal's little snack bar. <BR>
<BR>
Bangalore has all the features of a gold-rush town. Frequent travellers
to China assure you things are worse there. But Bangalore is not competing
with China: it is India's own Singapore wannabe. That said, at first sight
the contrast with Singapore is so marked that you might be excused for laughing.
What was once one of India's best planned cities is now suffering as ill-considered
new office developments spring up, making traffic jams a commonplace in
the business districts. <BR>
<BR>
Even the most elementary traffic management is notable by its absence. The
traffic lights go off thanks to the state's acute power crisis. And pollution
from car exhausts reaches new highs every day, helped along by India's equivalent
of the East German Trabant, a ubiquitous smoke-belching vehicle which has
a two-stroke engine and three wheels and which is proudly produced for the
nation by Bajaj Auto. <BR>
<BR>
India's high-tech capital needs enormous help with its infrastructure -
its power, its roads and its water supply. It needs to curb property speculators
and ensure orderly development of world class office complexes. But that
is where the dissimilarities with Singapore end. <BR>
<BR>
Like Singapore, Bangalore's highly trained human resource base has proved
particularly adept at highly skilled jobs. Were it not for the frequent
powercuts, productivity in Bangalore's high-tech industry could compare
well with world standards. And despite all its inconveniences, it still
remains among India's most liveable cities. The government is finally making
an effort to make sure it remains that way. After years of dithering, a
power purchasing agreement for the Cogentrix power project has almost been
signed. Officials in Bangalore expect financing to be completed by the middle
of this year. <BR>
<BR>
Equally important, the state government has just signed a memorandum of
understanding with India's giant Tata group and Singapore's Changi Airport
Authority on building a new international airport. For investors in technology,
telecommunications, electronics, precision engineering and apparel manufacture,
Bangalore is by far India's best location, retaining the laurels it first
won in <I>World Link</I>'s rankings two years ago. But its dominance in
these areas in threatened by Pune in Maharashtra, a city which has many
of Bangalore's advantages, but which is close to India's financial centre
Bombay and which is better supplied with power. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Ford steps out of line </B><BR>
<BR>
Notwithstanding Ford's decision to locate its proposed passenger car manufacturing
joint venture in the state of Tamil Nadu, the Bombay-Pune-Nasik triangle
also continues to remain as the most often chosen location for investments
in the automobile industry, auto components industry and other metal bashing
industries. <BR>
<BR>
Although Bombay (now renamed Mumbai) could prove an extremely expensive
location for all but the financial services sector, industrial area developments
around New Bombay, close to the modern Jawaharial Nehru Port and on the
road to Pune, could be attractive new locations. Despite the Enron fracas,
Maharashtra's government is clearly among the most progressive and the state's
infrastructure development and the availability of trained manpower makes
it a particularly good choice. <BR>
<BR>
Tamil Nadu remains in second position for the mechanical engineering, automobile
and auto component industries despite the extremely well-developed cluster
around Madras city and Hosur (which is effectively a suburb of Bangalore).
The decision-making process of the Tamil Nadu's government often tends to
put off investors, although this could improve. <BR>
<BR>
Gujarat still continues to retain top spot as a location for industries
like chemicals and petrochemicals. Other states like Punjab, Haryana, West
Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh have also been popular
locations. Both Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have earned a reputation for
very progressive state bureaucracies and would, whatever the political hue
of any incumbent government, remain ideal sites for resource industries.
Punjab and Haryana could be attractive for agroprocessing and light engineering.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Kerala tries to balance Bangalore </B><BR>
<BR>
Despite their efforts, it is difficult to envisage either state being able
to provide significant location advantages for skills-based industries and
electronics. Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal appear to foster a mixed bag
of industries, which is perhaps their greatest attraction. Interestingly,
the southern state of Kerala has begun to attract some attention as a possible
industrial location, but this is mainly because the incumbent central government
industry minister is pushing its case. Before he moved to Delhi, as chief
minister of Kerala, K Karunakaran worked to set up a software technology
park in an attempt to create a counterweight to Bangalore. Kerala has an
abundance of manpower which it has always supplied to the rest of the country
and the Middle East. But progress elsewhere in the state has been tardy.
<BR>
<BR>
Some states still lag behind the pacesetters. Thus western Uttar Pradesh
has seen a spurt in industrial investment, but this is more the result of
proximity to Delhi than due to the efforts of the UP government. Both UP
and Bihar continue to be seen as industry locations of last resort. <BR>
<BR>
Surveys looking for the most attractive industrial locations, now conducted
regularly by a number of independent agencies, provide a reasonable picture
to potential investors. A survey on investor-friendliness carried out by
the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade early last year placed Gujarat top
of the pile with Maharastra, Haryana, Punjab and Karnataka also in the first
group. Second division states included Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan,
West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh. <BR>
<BR>
A more sophisticated survey conducted across the country by <I>Business
World</I> and the Marketing and Research Group (MARG) has attracted notice.
Respondents enumerated a variety of factors that qualified a state as an
attractive industrial location and listed manpower availability, power supply,
the availability of raw materials and transport facilities and the availability
of subsidies and incentives as the six most crucial. Foreign investors would
need to add quality of life to that list. There is little reason to question
the importance of most other factors, but analysts believe that investors
looking too closely at fiscal incentives and subsidies could be making a
mistake. Even if a state like Bihar were to give land away free along with
a sales tax deferment for 10 years, Maharashtra could be a significantly
better location because of other factors. States which spend on infrastructure
and create an atmosphere conducive to growth are definitely a better location
option than those which hand out gifts. <BR>
<BR>
Ultimately the <I>Business World</I>/MARG survey came up with few surprises
(see table, p136). As expected, the overall ratings put Maharashtra on top
followed by Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Punjab. But when investors
begin to consider government attitudes the rankings seem to change, sometimes
very dramatically. Andersen's Sid Khanna says: &quot;Government can at times
be the biggest barrier. State approvals are easier promised than obtained.
We hear horror stories of corruption.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A recent survey by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (see
table below) attempted to find out the extent of delays by government authorities
in according necessary approval to firms setting up new units and the necessity
or otherwise of making unofficial payments to obtain expeditions clearances,
had some startling results. Respondent firms reported that most time was
needed in the case of power supply and effluent discharge. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The price of surly inefficiency </B><BR>
<BR>
The states of Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh were quickest and Karnataka
and West Bengal were slowest in giving approval. Of greater concern, perhaps,
is the finding that the incidence of unofficial payments was highest in
Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Karnataka, lowest in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat
and West Bengal. Respondent firms also noticed a significant improvement
in administration in a group of states including Madhya Pradesh and Punjab
and no improvement at all in Delhi, Haryana and Karnataka, although they
are likely to contest virtually every aspect of the survey from composition
of the sample onwards. Clearly, state governments must pay attention to
these results. With each assiduously wooing investment, governments can
afford to tolerate surly, inefficient and corrupt bureaucracies only at
the risk of driving away intending investors.*

<H3>ENGINES FOR GROWTH </H3>
<H4>India is now one of the world automobile industry's prime targets and
sales are continuing their steep rise 
</H4><I>By Meenakshi Behara </I><BR>
<BR>
For India's big spenders, it was the automobile event of the year. Last
October, Mercedes Benz finally made its debut in India with a locally assembled
product. It barely mattered that the product was a jaded series that had
just been phased out in Europe. <BR>
<BR>
Just a few months earlier, India's car buyers encountered another modern,
if less luxurious and expensive manufacturer, when the Korean firm Daewoo
launched its Cielo. And that was just the beginning. Peugeot, Fiat and General
Motors are all set to launch products in India. Some time next year Ford
may introduce its Escort, while Honda plans to bring in its Civic. Hyundai
is also interested and Volkswagen is taking a long hard look, as are BMW,
Daihatsu and Toyota. Last year was the year of the automobile in India.
<BR>
<BR>
Few markets have generated as much interest for the world's car makers in
recent years. India's economic growth has meant an explosive increase in
sales. After growing at over 27% for two years, sales growth of 30% is now
expected. This could push sales past 350,000. <BR>
<BR>
And there is still room for more expansion, according to industry insiders.
RC Bhargava, managing director of Suzuki's Indian affiliate Maruti Udyog,
observes: &quot;Our studies suggest that the market for cars could be of
the order of 750,000 to 800,000 by the year 2000.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
That would mean annual growth of 20% until the end of the century. Many
believe this is feasible. Some, like research firm DRI McGraw Hill do not.
The firm estimates a much more conservative 450,000 for the year 2000. One
bullish industry insider restorts: &quot;At best their numbers suggest a
definition problem, at worst it's an issue of not understanding the market.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
It has been pointed out that different vehicles are needed for urban and
non-urban areas and only a combination of both would represent the true
size of the market for personal transport. Combining both, the demand for
cars this year could top 450,000. <BR>
<BR>
Strong growth has also meant healthy profits. Maruti Udyog ended last year
made a pre-tax profit of Rs2.45 billion (US$70 million) and the firm could,
according to Bhargava, post a record figure of Rs6.6 billion for the current
year. Utility vehicles manufacturer Mahindra &amp; Mahindra is displaying
a similar impressive rise in profits. And Tatas Engineering and Locomotive
Company (Telco), which spans both public and personal transport, recorded
Rs4.5 billion in March and hopes to end March 1996 with a profit of over
Rs8 billion. Little wonder then that India's automobile market looks so
attractive to global corporations. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Foreigners heading up-market </B><BR>
<BR>
Along with the growth in numbers, the market is segmenting and maturing.
The entry-level or basic car remains the monopoly of Maruti, with most foreign
firms so far avoiding that sector. Anand Mahindra, deputy managing director
of Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, says: &quot;No one can today provide a value
package comparable to the Maruti 800 in the entry level segment.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Though Daewoo makes a Suzuki variant in Korea, it has so far been reluctant
to produce the model in India. Japan's small car maker Daihatsu has conducted
a pre-feasibility study jointly with the Hinduja group, although they have
not decided on any specific strategy. But industry observers believe two
home-grown giants, truckmaker Telco and light vehicle manufacturer Bajaj
Auto, could enter the fray. <BR>
<BR>
Bhargava is unfazed at the prospects and remarks: &quot;Any new entrant
will have to buy market share. Being truly competitive would call for a
high local content and high production volumes.&quot; Entrants would find
it difficult, he believes, to match the material costs for the Maruti 800,
currently under $2,800, or its final cost of about $3,600. <BR>
<BR>
But Bajaj may manage to do just that through a tie-up with Fuji, maker of
the Subaru, Bajaj is expected to enter into direct competition with Maruti.
The company's expertise in low-cost, high-volume production gained in the
light vehicle business could come in very handy. And its distribution and
sales network is vast. <BR>
<BR>
Telco's approach is expected to hinge on radically altering the concept
of entry-level cars to suit Indian needs. Telco could bring in diesel engine
technology to create a competitive edge, even if it means a more expensive
product than the Maruti offering. Most crucially Maruti's complete reliance
on Japanese partner Suzuki for even the most minor product development could
slow its response to competition. The entry level Maruti already looks outdated
and is in urgent need of upgrading. Anand Mahindra, whose company has a
50:50 joint venture with Ford is waiting for just such a development: &quot;The
price position of an upgrade of the Maruti 800 will be the level to attack.
The Ford Fiesta will attempt to do precisely that,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
Industry analysts believe the Ford/Mahindra positioning strategy could be
successful and that the Fiesta could prove much more of a draw than the
smaller Suzuki Alto (christened Zen in India) or the Fiat Uno, which is
already more than a decade old. <BR>
<BR>
The market for medium-sized cars looks overcrowded. With Daewoo, Peugeot,
General Motors, Honda and Ford joining Maruti, analysts predict that bloodletting
could be just around the corner. Hyundai and Toyota could well join that
list. Daewoo's initial efforts have already been labelled a monumental marketing
disaster, perhaps prematurely. Few believe that even Peugeot can withstand
the pressure. Mahindra for one believes that &quot;Ford and General Motors
will ultimately be the only survivors in this segment.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
For that, the two giants will have to establish a loyal supporter base.
Maruti, which clung to the government's petticoats for years extracting
all manner of protection and advantage, has now learned to erect entry barriers
of its own. In a swift move, it persuaded most of its component suppliers
to sign exclusivity clauses. Ford and GM may use their existing global component
suppliers, but breaching the barrier will prove difficult for many other
firms. <BR>
<BR>
Daewoo has moved aggressively into India. Along with its car manufacturing
operations, the company has invested an estimated $1 billion in the component
sector. India could then become a global sourcing point for both components
and final products. The strategy should enable Daewoo to keep Indian products
technologically in line with global offerings. The latest Korean entrant,
Hyundai, has indicated a similar strategy for its Indian operations. <BR>
<BR>
All the other entrants, including Mercedes Benz, have invested export earnings,
either from component or product exports. That became necessary when the
government saw the flood of hopefuls wanting a piece of the Indian action.
Worried officials realised that imports of knock-down kits (CKD) could cost
$1 billion annually in foreign exchange outflows. The import of plants and
equipment could only add to that figure. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Government pieces deal together </B><BR>
<BR>
After a great deal of procrastination and confusion, the government allowed
the start-ups to import equipment and CKD kits. But the firms had to agree
to offset the imports by exporting components as well as final products
from India, under conditions reviewed regularly by the central government
in Delhi. <BR>
<BR>
Even so, it is questionable whether the the export commitments can be met,
particularly in relation to finished products. Bhargava contends that &quot;the
import content of Maruti's exports is approximately 60%&quot;, the other
imports make that figure much higher. Some even contend that the Alto, which
accounts for over half Maruti's exports, could include imports worth more
than the price of the car. <BR>
<BR>
Increasingly, global majors are paying heed to the industry's weaknesses.
Ford Motor Credit has announced a financing joint venture that could help
develop the used car market. Growth in that area is vital for continued
growth in the car sales and the health of the automotive sector in India.*

<H3>HANGING ON THE TELEPHONE</H3>
<H4>The long-running story of bungled telecom company sell-offs is a warning
example of how not to privatise 
</H4><I>By Meenakshi Behara </I><BR>
<BR>
The fact that foreign investors stress the need for predictability and a
clearly defined framework when dealing with the Indian government is understandable.
Recent events in India's telecommunications sector have highlighted just
how unpredictable the ways of Indian policymakers can be. <BR>
<BR>
India's ambitious telecommunications growth plans first attracted international
attention when in 1984 the Department of Telecom prepared its first Perspective
Plan. This plan envisaged total telephone line demand reaching 30 million
by the year 2000 and aimed at providing connections practically on demand.
The planned capacity increase would also have required an improvement in
the technology used in switching and transmission facilities. <BR>
<BR>
Realising the enormity of the task at hand, the government first moved to
privatise telecoms equipment production. It then corporatised its two most
profitable service operations, international switching and transmission
and the telephone systems of Bombay and Delhi, and then divested part of
its shareholding in both entities. This was to pay for the planned expansion
in services in other parts of the country. The DoT then grew even more ambitious.
With a view to increase telephone lines from the abysmal 6 per 1,000 in
1993 to 40 per 1,000 by the year 2000 it decided to involve the private
sector in providing a variety of services. <BR>
<BR>
According to RK Takkar, chairman of the Telecom Commission: &quot;An expansion
of that order would have required an investment of almost $30 billion in
basic services alone.&quot; The government decided, therefore, to privatise
value added services including voice mail, paging services and cellular
telephone services. The first major initiative to provide cellular phones
in four major cities ran aground after unsuccessful bidders took legal action
to protest against the selection process. The award of radio-paging contracts
fared no better. Problems were said to have arisen because the tenders were
issued without framing adequate rules or procedures governing the issue
of licences. <BR>
<BR>
The government continued to blunder along. It decided to divest through
a global depository receipt (GDR), its holdings in VSNL, the state corporation
which handles international services. It believed the proceeds of the GDR
would pay for a rapid expansion in basic services and the government monopoly
could effectively be retained even while meeting ambitious growth targets.
The VSNL GDR proved a fiasco, failing to raise the hoped-for sum. <BR>
<BR>
Stumped for cash, the DoT then decided to lease switches in the hope of
reducing its capital costs. It ended up paying much higher lease rates than
corporates could have managed in a year of historic lows in interest rates.
In May 1994, the National Telecom policy was announced and the basic services
were thrown open to the private sector. &quot;Our entire model has been
unique. We decided that basic services needed to be opened up particularly
where telephone density is low, then we could move into opening regional
services and ultimately long-distance ones too,&quot; says Takkar. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Hell breaks loose on the telephones </B><BR>
<BR>
In January last year the tenders were offered, allowing the private sector
to operate basic telecom services in 21 areas grouped into three categories
based on revenue potential. Industry observers said the government was biting
off more than it could chew. Takkar defends the DoT's move and observes:
&quot;We did consider a staggered process, realising we were on a learning
curve and that there was a possibility of getting higher bids with each
subsequent tender. But then we'd have been accused of regional discrimination.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The trouble really started when the 81 bids from 16 groupings were finally
evaluated. A little-known hardware supplier, Himachal Futuristic Communications,
with an annual turnover of $35 million joined with Bezeq of Israel and Shinawatra
of Thailand to bid an astounding $27 billion licence fee to be paid over
15 years. Unsurprisingly, it topped the tender in nine states and pushed
joint ventures with global telecoms operators out of the reckoning. All
hell broke loose. <BR>
<BR>
After a various twists and turns the rules were changed so that bidders
were confined to a maximum number of zones, raising suspicions that the
government was more interested in protecting its own intraregional service
monopoly. The HFCL picked three contiguous areas (Delhi, Haryana and eastern
Uttar Pradesh) committing licence fees of just over $7 billion. The government
rejected bids in 10 zones as too low, which forced a second round. <BR>
<BR>
This tender for 13 zones produced competing bids in only one, Punjab, and
uncontested bids in four zones. Eight zones failed to attract any bids.
All the winners were combinations of large Indian groups and international
telecoms operators: Tatas and Bell Canada in Andhra Pradesh, RP Goenka and
Japan's NTT in Tamil Nadu, Essar and Bell Atlantic in Punjab, Reliance Industries
and Nynex in Gujarat and Usha Group and Moscow Telecom in Bihar. There may
now be a third round of bids, although the legality of the whole process
under legal challenge. <BR>
<BR>
Takkar puts up a brave front. &quot;We are not going through with a distress
sale. We can afford to wait and go for a third round,&quot; he says. What
Takkar and the DoT seem unconcerned about is just how bidders will react.
Ten previous bidding consortia opted out of the second round. Responses
to the third round could be even more lukewarm. With continuous and bungling
rule-fixing, the DoT has not covered itself with glory. Now pessimists shudder
at the thought of a telecoms sector where competent service providers stay
away while the sector metamorphoses from an inefficient monopoly to an inefficient
and expensive duopoly.<p>

<H2>SWEDEN </H2>
<H4>Until the 80's, Sweden's triumphs in industrial production and social
capitalism were the envy of the world. But the shining example became tarnished
by the first signs of social upheaval, tax evasion on a massive scale and
economic crisis. Much support remains for cherished ideals of the Swedish
model, but there is broad acceptance of the need for a leaner form of welfare
state <BR>

<H3><A NAME="overview"></A>GOODBYE TO A MODEL LIFE</H3>
<B>In the aftermath of economic crisis, Sweden has learned to live with
doubt about its much-envied welfare ideals </B>
<I>By Marek Garztecki </I><BR>
<BR>
The Swedes apparently had it all: a sophisticated industrial production
and clean environment, low unemployment and full welfare provisions, an
egalitarian society and sexual freedom. The Swedish model was the envy and
aspiration of many countries. Sure, there were some drawbacks such as high
taxation and state intrusiveness, but they were considered minor irritants
compared with the benefits derived. <BR>
<BR>
So when things went wrong - and they went dreadfully wrong - there was a
sense of <I>Schadenfreude</I> among many European commentators. There were
no special economic and social laws, after all, that applied only to Sweden
and excluded the rest of humanity. <BR>
<BR>
The beginnings of the Swedish model go back to the interwar period. The
experience of World War I and the example of the Bolshevik revolution may
have helped the Social Democratic Party to power, but it was the Great Depression
that encouraged the creation of the all-encompassing welfare state. And
the Swedes went for social engineering on a decisive scale. <BR>
<BR>
Neutrality during World War II helped Sweden avoid the armed combat that
destroyed most of Europe and draw economic benefits from its position, lifting
the relatively poor country to the status of one of the world's richest
nations. By then Keynesian economics, only just introduced on a larger scale
in the rest of Europe, was already part of the Swedish model. <BR>
<BR>
In the postwar confrontation that developed between the west and the Soviet
bloc, Sweden steadfastly maintained its political neutrality and combined
it with a very vigorous democracy. There was never any doubt that the country
was firmly in the free-market camp, even if it was combined with pervasive
state intervention. <BR>
<BR>
A high tax regime was intended not only to cover the needs of state administration
but also to redistribute wealth more fairly. The consistency of that policy
was ensured by 50 years of almost uninterrupted rule by the Social Democratic
Party. Swedish socialists practised what the communists in the Soviet bloc
only preached. Far from being an adversary, as was the case in most other
western countries, Swedish business was a willing partner in this system.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The labour government has never hindered business,&quot; says Bertil
Thorngren, senior vice-president of the Telia telecommunications group.
&quot;The deal was this: if you businessmen do not interfere with politics,
we politicians will not interfere with business.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Initially a wide social security net, statutory education and high wages
yielded the desired effects. Industrial peace and social cohesion alongside
elevated living standards became the country's hallmarks. A high-quality
state school system with its emphasis on technology and applied science
produced numerous engineers for eagerly awaiting employers. This human capital,
according to Invest in Sweden agency chief Kai Hammerich, still gives his
country an important competitive advantage. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Global guidance and Nobel prizes </B><BR>
<BR>
Benefiting from this advantage, high-tech Swedish companies such as Asea
- the Swedish part of the conglomerate Asea Brown Boveri - Atlas Coptic
and ball-bearing manufacturer SKF surged ahead, becoming world leaders in
their chosen fields and turning into multinational corporations in the process.
<BR>
<BR>
The international pre-eminence of electronic giant Ericsson was established
by the one-piece Ericophone, a telephone that became one of the design icons
of the postwar era. Volvo cars became a by-word for safety and quality.
With booming production and increasing wealth came self-assurance and a
creeping smugness. Suddenly, it was not enough to dish out Nobel prizes
to the rest of the planet: Swedish leaders found themselves lecturing the
so-called Great Powers on how to run their international affairs. Companies
also discovered new overseas markets and places where they could produce
goods cheaply. <BR>
<BR>
But there were difficulties ahead that did not reveal themselves until several
years later. &quot;Swedish economic problems became apparent in the early
'90s, but the groundwork for them was laid much earlier,&quot; explains
G&ouml;ran Ennerfelt, president and chief executive of Axel Johnson AB,
Sweden's largest retail group. &quot;Throughout the '70s and '80s we built
a certain degree of inflexibility and rather high cost levels into our economy.
This was partly public policy but, if we are honest, it was also done with
the complicity of the business sector. We were over-generous with our social
security system and the way we tried to provide for our citizens. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;During the '80s we were growing more slowly than other countries because
of this inflexibility and were less able to adjust to change. Our political
leaders were proud of what they had achieved and even small adjustments
to [the Swedish model] were seen as an admission of defeat.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
In the early '80s the country experienced substantial devaluation of the
krona and it gradually became apparent that an era was coming to an end.
Although the country's 15 or so large corporations were still doing nicely
the growth of the small and medium-sized enterprises ground to a halt, stifled
by high taxes, red tape and unfavourable labour laws. &quot;Tax fiddles
became a national norm,&quot; claims one small producer of electronic components.
&quot;If you were not doing it, you were only harming yourselves because
everyone else did.&quot; Yet even today, three years after giving up the
business he still refuses to be quoted on-the-record, fearing the revenge
of the fiscal authorities. <BR>
<BR>
Worse was yet to come. The still unexplained assassination of the popular
prime minister Olof Palme in 1986 revealed a dark undercurrent in Swedish
society. Youth disturbances, an alarming growth in drug abuse and well-publicised
attacks on immigrant communities were proof that the Swedish model was fraying
at the edges. <BR>
<BR>
According to Ennerfelt, the opening up of the Swedish economy which came
when it moved to harmonise laws with those of its prospective European partners
proved to have some undesirable short-term consequences. Exchange controls
in place since the war were lifted and the tax system changed, cutting high
tax rates of up to 85% but also eliminating the generous expense deductions<B>
</B>which had meant that the real level of tax paid under the old system
was far lower than it appeared. <BR>
<BR>
Ennerfelt believes that several factors contributed to the subsequent financial
bubble that hit Sweden's banking system: &quot;In our inflationary economy
it paid to borrow money as one could always count on property and stock
prices going up. Once exchange controls were removed property companies
went abroad and by the turn of the '90s Swedish investors were the biggest
players on the European market. They were like calves in a spring meadow
for the first time, making all the mistakes it was possible to make. When
the tax system changed, the real cost of borrowing money suddenly became
apparent. The inflation rate went down and the real cost of interest increased.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
At the beginning of 1993 all but one of the main Swedish banks applied for
state aid. Two of them, Nordbanken and Gota Bank, had to be taken over by
the state because they were practically insolvent and the conservative government
of the day was forced to provide a blanket guarantee for the whole sector.
The move steadied the confidence of the market but could hardly be described
as an example of the free-market non-interventionism the conservatives were
preaching. Not all bankers were impressed. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We were the only bank in Sweden, Norway and Finland that did not ask
for government support,&quot; declares Arne Martensson, president and CEO
of the Svenska Handelsbanken. &quot;My criticism is not that the government
took care of the troubled banks but that its help went too far. They cleaned-up
the balance sheets so now those banks are in a better position than any
other bank in Scandinavia. The most prudent ones ended as the biggest losers.
That certainly distorted the competition.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
For such active intervention to take place under Carl Bildt's premiership
is not without its ironies. Bildt came to power in 1991 as a head of Sweden's
second non-socialist government. He saw his mission as a Thatcherite one
to dismantle suffocating welfare provisions, cut taxes and reduce state
intervention.<B> </B>His was the first postwar generation that did not believe
fully in the Swedish model. Sweden was now to take a bite of humble pie
and learn from countries like Britain or Germany how to run its public finances.
<BR>
<BR>
The banking crisis forced the Bildt government to re-order its priorities.
The economy went into a nose-dive and between the second quarter of 1990
and the first quarter of 1993 GPD declined on average by 2.2% per year.
In the same period unemployment rose from 1% to 8.2%: almost 13% if participants
in state programmes were counted. As revenue contracted, the cost of unemployment
benefits skyrocketed. The ratio of government debt to GDP climbed from 45%
in 1990 to 85% in 1994. Measured by per capita GDP Sweden slipped from third
place in the table of the world's richest nations in 1970 to 16th in the
mid-'90s. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Winners as well as losers </B><BR>
<BR>
But there were winners as well as losers as some companies, such as Handelsbanken,
used the retrenchment period and relative weakness of competitors to their
advantage. &quot;We started to expand in 1990 in Norway and Finland,&quot;
explains Martensson. &quot;We now have 13 branches in Norway employing 300
people and a similar number in Finland. In years to come we will see more
of that, while other Nordic banks will go into the Swedish market. Today
we are the largest commercial bank in the Nordic area.&quot; The enforced
devaluation of the krona provided a much-needed shot in the arm for industry.
By 1994 exports were growing fast again year on year, to 13.3% on the previous
year, up from 2.3% in 1992. This provided a backdrop to two important events
of that year, the general election and the referendum on joining the EU.
<BR>
<BR>
In September 1994 the Swedish Social Democratic leader Ingvar Carlsson returned
to the prime minister's office with a programme to restore the welfare state.
Soon he and finance minister G&ouml;ran Persson were to realise that economic
realities left them with little room for manoeuvre. Shortly after assuming
his post, Persson presented a &quot;budget reinforcement programme&quot;
to the <I>Riksdag</I> or parliament of additional fiscal measures including
new taxes and spending cuts totalling SKR57 billion. The total package adopted
was worth SKR118 billion or 7.5% of GDP. <BR>
<BR>
By the end of last year evidence showed that the bitter medicine was having
the desired effect. According to government statistics, annual GDP growth
in 1994-95 was estimated at 4%. Growth rates for the next two years were
officially expected to be in the 2% to 2.5% range. Both short- and long-term
interest rates were expected to move downwards, with the five-year rate
at 7.5% by the second half of 1997. <BR>
<BR>
Job creation is to remain a government priority with a 1.8% growth in employment
this year despite further overall productivity gains. The most dramatic
progress, however, is expected in the reduction of the budget deficit, that
is to fall below 7% of GDP in 1995 from 13.4% in the previous year. This
should also help to reduce state debt. <BR>
<BR>
With the economic crisis over, did the Swedish model weather the storm?
Persson has few doubts. &quot;Yes, there is room for the Swedish model and
I am committed to it,&quot; he says.&quot;The mistake we made during the
'70s was that the welfare state was not built on sound public finances.
We were borrowing money to keep the model going and that was unacceptable.
After going through this hard period Sweden should still come out with a
significantly large public sector. We will still have rather high taxes,
but we will have a balanced situation with low inflation and interest rates
on a European level.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>A more realistic welfare state </B><BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Swedish model is basically a pretty good one,&quot; agrees Ennerfelt.
&quot;The proof of the pudding is that most countries around the world have
done precisely what Sweden has done. Sweden was ahead of others and we overshot
by making our system so attractive that in some cases it paid more not to
work than to work productively in the economy. If you create disincentives
of this type, of course you will find it difficult keeping the economy growing.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The adjustments that we are now making are not the dismantling of
the welfare state but trimming it back to more realistic levels. Sweden
is now regaining one of its most important advantages, of adapting very
quickly. The reason for that is that we have a highly educated workforce
and a management that is questioning. Labour unions support the change.
This has made it possible for large companies, including our own, to make
drastic changes that have led to changes in the labour force without causing
disruptions in the system,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
Handelsbanken president Martensson, who questions the continuing validity
of the Swedish model, nevertheless admits to good labour relations in his
own company and to his own great reluctance to fire staff: &quot;This is
not a part of our corporate culture,&quot; he concedes. A well-educated,
flexible workforce, good industrial relations and trade unions that are
tough but willing to assist employers in restructuring are quoted by Hammerich
as some of the best features of Swedish business. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What is not generally known is that while Sweden was a high-cost country
in the '80s, we have become a low-cost country today,&quot; declares Hammerich.
He expects Sweden to remain so: &quot;The political intention is to stay
that way, to keep inflation down. We have a lower rate of inflation now
than most countries in Europe.&quot; <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>

<H3><A NAME="premier-persson"></A>MAN IN A PRIME POSITION</H3>
<B>G&ouml;ran Persson said he would best serve his country as finance minister,
but that was before the top job came up<BR>
<BR>
</B><I>By Marek Garztecki </I><BR>
<BR>
On the eve of this issue going to press the news broke that, despite the
protestations he made in an interview with <I>World Link</I>, Swedish finance
minister G&ouml;ran Persson was in fact due to succeed Ingvar Carlsson as
leader of the ruling Social Democrats, and hence as prime minister, this
March. The views he expresses will have perforce changed. <BR>
<BR>
Persson has undergone a baptism of fire. He took up the post of finance
minister in the middle of his country's worst financial crisis for 50 years.
Now, after 15 months in office, his problems are still far from over and
on the eve of the interview a public row broke out between Persson and another
minister about Sweden's private pension funds. <BR>
<BR>
It is not the first time that the ruling Social Democratic Party has given
the impression of having more than one policy in financial matters but,
sitting in his Stockholm office, Persson was confidence itself. &quot;Yes,
we had a really difficult period for the last three to four weeks,&quot;
he admitted. &quot;Yet, if you look at the markets, they have not reacted
to it at all, they are still confident in our ability to handle the situation.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
With the impending retirement of Ingvar Carlsson, Persson was long tipped
as Sweden's next prime minister but in the interview he strenuously denied
this ambition: &quot;I have firmly declared that I am not running for the
prime minister's post. I will stay at my present one and make sure that
the financial policy stays firm.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Second in importance </B><BR>
<BR>
Presented with an argument that a prime minister with a firm grasp of financial
matters may be the best choice to steady the nerves of the international
business community, he retorted that there was also a need for a strong
minister of finance. &quot;Were the ruling party to change both the prime
minister and the minister of finance at the same time, it would cause even
more uncertainty,&quot; he claimed. &quot;In Sweden the finance minister
has always had a very strong position in the government, especially the
Social Democratic ones. Traditionally he is second in importance only to
the prime minister. There is no doubt in my mind that I should stay and
help the next prime minister. The candidates that have been mentioned are
all committed to the same policies as I am.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A year earlier, his predictions for imminent improvements in the economy
were greeted with widespread scepticism. Did he feel vindicated now? &quot;Yes,
of course,&quot; came the quick answer. &quot;At the same time it is important
to stress that we are still in a dangerous position. Our debt is too large
to say that there are no risks. A year ago I was criticised by some who
argued that the recovery programme was not bold enough, while others said
it was too bold. Yet it turned out to be of exactly the right magnitude.
I presented the right package and I was able to take it through parliament,
something that was questioned a year ago. It is also important to remember
that it was done by a minority government.&quot; The programme, euphemistically
called a &quot;budgetary reinforcement&quot; was a bitter diet of taxes,
spending cuts and austerity measures. But how far will he be able to take
the electorate with him if there are differences of opinion even within
his own party? The answer was firm: &quot;The programme will be taken all
the way because this is necessary. We have already taken all necessary decisions
and carried out two thirds of the programme. A new wave will start in January
1996 and another in January 1997.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Drop in popularity </B><BR>
<BR>
Persson admits that his party suffered a big drop in popularity in the opinion
polls because of the programme but he is still optimistic: &quot;We have
still three years to go to the next elections and this is a very long time.
We have also an extremely strong position in parliament, with many other
parties supporting our programme. They are calculating that if we succeed
they want to be on the right side, sharing the reward from the electorate.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Persson concedes that the task facing him now is to convince his own parliamentary
group to line up behind the programme unanimously. At first many observers
questioned the ability of the Social Democratic government to reduce the
size of the public debt, something that eluded their conservative predecessors.
But the minister points to a typically Swedish paradox: &quot;In our society
there is very strong support for values, like solidarity, that underpin
the whole Swedish model. So if you have to adjust this model and the level
of public expenditure it must be done by those political forces that have
built it. Only [our party] could gain enough broad support to do it.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The reduction in public debt, planned by the finance minister, is equally
ambitious. &quot;We have already achieved stabilisation of the public debt
as a ratio to GDP in 1995, something we thought we would only be able to
do in 1998. This is partly because of the recovery in the business cycle,&quot;
he admits, pointing also to the strong effect of the reinforcement programme.
&quot;Our problem was not the debt itself but its rapid growth, which started
in the period 92-94. That, I can say, is now under control.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Pragmatic attitude to privatisation </B><BR>
<BR>
While Persson's free-market credentials are not in doubt, some claim that
the Social Democratic government is less than enthusiastic about the privatisation
of some state-owned companies. &quot;We are neither in favour nor against
privatisation on ideological grounds,&quot; said Persson. &quot;We have
a pragmatic attitude; we will do it if we get a good price and if, after
privatisation, companies will be in a better condition to fulfil their tasks.
My reinforcement programme is not dependent on privatisation revenues, they
come on top of it. All my budgetary calculations are without taking them
into account and that also concerns meeting the [Maastricht] convergence
criteria.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The Swedish government currently pursues a dual-track policy. While being
officially non-committal about future membership of the EMU, it is striving
to achieve all the convergence criteria in time. Persson himself is more
forthright: &quot;I myself want Sweden to be a member. This, of course,
is up to Swedish parliament but when the time comes for it to take a decision
we want to be in a position strong enough to allow us the freedom of choice.
I believe we will meet the criteria in 1997, something that nobody thought
possible even a year ago. We could be in the first group of countries that
will form the third phase of the EMU process.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
At the same time all polls indicate a growing public opposition to Swedish
membership of the EU. Yet Persson is convinced that were Sweden to stay
outside, its weak economy and an almost disastrous state of public finances
would be hit even harder. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You could say that we are divided about the EMU process and about
the membership of the EU,&quot; he confessed. &quot;But this is a situation
in almost any European country today. Those politicians who want the membership
of the EMU , have to challenge the electorate and tell it what they are
going to do.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In Sweden today public opinion is strongly against membership of the
monetary union. Who can say that this will also be the case in a year or
two? You have to stand up and argue your case. The same process will have
to take place in France, Germany, the UK, everywhere. This is especially
true of countries that have a strong currency, where it is a symbol. I still
believe that there will be a monetary union on January 1, 1999 and that
is the Swedish planning horizon.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sweden's contribution to Europe </B><BR>
<BR>
Persson also has firm views about the future role Sweden can play in Europe.
&quot;I look upon it as an opportunity for a small country, with a strong
international tradition, to take part in political discussions about how
this fantastic continent of Europe should be developed,&quot; he enthused.
He has a vision of a just society, one that he would also like to see in
a European context. He also sees the need for a new EU agricultural policy,
one that is compatible with the growth of east and central Europe. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The enlargement is something that is extremely important,&quot; he
said. &quot;When the initial six countries of what is today the EU got together,
their main aim was to ensure peace. Today the support for development of
democracy and market economy in central and eastern Europe also advances
the idea of peace in Europe. We have so much to do and so much in common
that if we do not take up this chance we will be punished by history,&quot;
he concludes.<BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>

<H3><A NAME="eastward-bound"></A>VITAL ACCESS TO THE EAST</H3>
<B>Sweden is forging business links with its eastern neighbours and paving
the way for others </B><BR>
<BR>
The Swedish map of the world, based on economic links, would have America
right at the Norwegian border with Germany and Holland a short distance
away. Southern Europe would slip right to the edge of the atlas and east
of Finland would show a vast emptiness. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our trading geography hardly resembles the physical one,&quot; says
G&ouml;ran Ennerfelt, president of the largest Swedish retail group Axel
Johnson AB and chair of the Russian-Swedish Chamber of Commerce. He would
like to see the map he describes changed and business links forged with
Sweden's immediate neighbours. <BR>
<BR>
The end of the Cold War and the expansion of the EU has opened up new possibilities.
Sweden is still predominately a manufacturing country but its service sector
is growing. <BR>
<BR>
A telling example is the Handelsbanken: widely regarded as a rather conservative
banking institution, it has grown faster than it intended. Already the number
one commercial bank in the Nordic area, Handelsbanken is eyeing the Baltic
States, in addition to having maintained an office in Moscow for 20 years
now. The collapse of a bank in Latvia has proved that there is plenty of
cash chasing all too few safe accounts, although some of that money may
be of dubious origin. <BR>
<BR>
Changes in manufacturing patterns were instigated by the furniture giant
IKEA in the mid-'70s. IKEA outsourced part of its manufacturing to Poland
and the Soviet Union. It provided its modern designs for the factories to
work to then bought the finished products, selling them worldwide through
its own retail outlets. The consumer buys Swedish design, usually unaware
that the product has been manufactured cheaply in <BR>
Eastern Europe. <BR>
<BR>
The IKEA model is one on which Sweden wants to build. Kai Hammerich, head
of the Invest in Sweden agency, compares the country's relationship with
its eastern neighbours to the role Hong Kong plays for mainland China. &quot;Outsourcing
production in Russia and the Baltic States cuts costs enormously,&quot;
he claims. &quot;Our trade with that area is booming, its increase is higher
than with any other region, but of course it is starting from a very low
base.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The biggest increase in our exports relates to central and eastern
Europe,&quot; agrees Ulf Dinkelspiel, who heads the Swedish Trade Council.
&quot;Last year it rose by 50%.&quot; The engineering giant ABB was the
first western company to make significant investments in Poland, buying
the newly privatised turbine and generator manufacturing plants. <BR>
<BR>
Banking, telecoms, environmental protection and services that are still
vastly underdeveloped in the formerly communist states are precisely the
areas where Sweden has acknowledged expertise. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Being in northern Europe we may have a geographical handicap, but
it is an important area of four countries with a population of 20 million.
Sweden is in the middle of this region,&quot; declares Hammerich. &quot;Include
St. Petersburg, Estonia, Latvia and so on and we are talking about a market
<BR>
of about 40 to 50 million people in our proximity,&quot; &quot;If you want
to have access to eastern Europe and the Baltic States without going there
directly, you have a hub here.&quot;<BR><BR> <HR WIDTH=60%>

<H3><A NAME="swedish-design"></A>A HIGH-TECH PIONEER </H3>
<B>Swedish design is respected the world over, with a flair for style matched
by a pragmatic approach to production <BR>
<BR>
</B><I>By Marek Garztecki </I><BR>
<BR>
From IKEA furniture to Esselte office materials, from Ericsson mobile telephones
to the ubiquitous Tetra-Pak juice carton and Volvo cars, the industrialised
world is full of Swedish consumer goods. A sizeable proportion of them are
probably made in south-east Asia or eastern Europe yet the products or their
manufacturers are generally recognised as Swedish and this fact greatly
contributes to their appeal. <BR>
<BR>
For a medium-sized country at the northern edge of the continent with a
population of less than 9 million, this is no mean achievement. Sweden developed
a successful industry oriented towards exports with a high-technology content
long before the &quot;high-tech&quot; tag was devised. <BR>
<BR>
Probably the first Swedish manufacturer to achieve international fame was
Alfred Nobel who, before founding a prestigious peace prize, vastly contributed
to the calamities of World War I through his invention of dynamite. Soon
after that Ivar Kreuger, &quot;the matchstick's king&quot;, created the
country's first multinational business empire whose collapse during the
Great Depression prolonged its duration. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Inventions into marketable products </B><BR>
<BR>
An inventor-manufacturer provided the first impetus to several of Sweden's
most famous companies. Gustav de Lavala, who patented the first centrifugal
cream separator in 1880s, also started the Alfa Laval industrial group that
is still a major international force today. The development of a three-phase
alternating current for transmitting electricity by Jonas Wenstrom, also
in the 1880s, was the foundation on which Asea of the multinational Asea
Brown Boveri (ABB) was built. <BR>
<BR>
Another famous engineering name, SKF, was founded in 1907 to exploit Sven
Winquist's invention of the self-aligning spherical roller bearing or ball-bearing.
Soon after, Victor Hasselblad gave his name to a camera generally recognised
as the Rolls-Royce of photography. The Hasselblad captured the first view
of the earth from space as well as the dark side of the moon. <BR>
<BR>
The ability of Swedish engineers not only to invent things but to turn them
into excellent, marketable products is, according to Kai Hammerich of the
Invest in Sweden agency, his country's main selling point. He believes that
a heavy emphasis on technology in the country's education system is the
main contributing factor. &quot;The proof of our international competitiveness
in that area are our 15 or so multinational companies. They have become
global today but they all have their origins in those areas of technology
we developed here.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
There is no doubt that Swedish goods display the traits to be found in the
proverbial Swedish personality: they are thought to be solid, functional
and honest. The Volvo car is a classic example, its very name a by-word
for quality of build and motoring safety. Heavy trucks made by Scania enjoy
a parallel reputation in their market segment. <BR>
<BR>
The combination of simple but sturdy designs with an emphasis on practicality
has resulted in a astonishing number of style icons such as the AGA stove,
Ericsson one-piece telephone sets or Kosta-Boda glasses that have found
their way not only to millions of homes all over the world but also art
exhibitions and museums. The commercial success of Absolut Vodka, which
in a few years conquered the white spirits market, has now become a textbook
case of effective marketing. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Exploring r&amp;d competence </B><BR>
<BR>
Sweden now intends to explore its r&amp;d competence in other areas by offering
its services to foreign companies. &quot;A researcher here costs half the
price of one in Switzerland or Germany,&quot; says Hammerich, whose agency
has identified 12 areas of expertise including information technology, recycling
and environmental technology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. <BR>
<BR>
Ulf Dinkelspiel, head of the Swedish Trade Council, says that they already
get between 200,000 and 300,000 enquiries a year. &quot;Roughly 10% lead
to the establishment of business links. It will eventually be difficult
to distinguish between exports, imports and the transfer of technical know-how,
especially in the services sector. It will be increasingly difficult to
say if something has crossed the border or not. We will be assisting Swedish
companies in the process of internationalisation, rather than solely helping
them export,&quot; predicts Dinkelspiel.<p>

<H2>PERU </H2>
<H4>Although President Alberto Fujimori's centralised rule can cause logjams
at the top, his economic policies and campaign against terrorism are enjoying
success. Rich mineral deposits, privatisation and a growing stock exchange
are attracting attention from foreign investors but further growth depends
on the country putting more emphasis on training and closing social disparities

<H3><A NAME="overview"></A>DIVIDED BUT GROWING </H3>
<BR>
<B>Having escaped a period of terrorism and anarchy, Peru has found itself
with a booming economy </B><I><BR>
<BR>
by Andrew Rosenbaum </I><BR>
<BR>
Some say there are two Perus, or even more, and the fusion of this varied
country into a working whole has always been crucial to its successful development.
&quot;Peru is a country of great disparities and complexity,&quot; says
Javier de la Rocha Marie, director general of the Banco Central de Reserva
del Peru. <BR>
<BR>
The first Peru, which consists of the affluent, educated and largely urban
classes who participate in the formal economy, is now enjoying a remarkable
turnaround. For them, a period of 15 years of terrorism has come to an end
and the official economy now offers enviable rewards. <BR>
<BR>
But for the 46% of Peruvians who still live below the poverty line, little
has changed. These citizens, who mostly live in rural areas, do not participate
in either the economic or political life of the country. The number of marginalised
has risen by 4% since 1990, regardless of the country's growth. <BR>
<BR>
Then there is the phenomenon that some including President Alberto Fujimoro,
have referred to as the &quot;third&quot; Peru. It consists of urban migrants
who populate the shanty towns at the edges of major cities who contribute
the lion's share to the country's thriving black economy. There are few
statistics available on this group but economists judge that they enjoy
incomes well above the poverty line and are becoming important economic
actors. <BR>
<BR>
The country has geographical as well as social divisions, its 1,285,216
square kilometres broken up into cities, mountains and jungle each with
very varied levels of development. Until now, the Fujimori government has
not really tried to pull the country together. Peru, like other countries
in Latin America, has a tradition of government from the top, for the top.
The Fujimoro government stands accused of ignoring development of democratic
institutions which would give everyone in Peru a voice. The government has
worked very successfully for economic reform yet experts say the reformed
economy may again be threatened by crime and terrorism if its disenfranchised
are not brought into the system. <BR>
<BR>
Fujimori has succeeded in rescuing Peru from the state of anarchy and collapse
to which it had fallen in 1990. Inflation, a horrific 7,650% per year in
1990, has been brought down to under 11% in 1995 and GDP, which hardly grew
at all in 1990, rose 12.7% in 1994 to $26.4 billion, the fastest growth
in the world. To keep the reins on inflation, the central bank is keeping
tight control of the money supply and growth should be limited to 5-7% per
year in the near future, according to De la Rocha Marie. <BR>
<BR>
Most important of all for the country's future, the Shining Path Maoist
revolutionary group recruited from the disenfranchised has been almost completely
defeated. It fell apart when its leader was arrested in 1992 and the number
of terrorist attacks has fallen from 2,000 in 1990 to less than 300 in 1995.
&quot;I used to keep shotguns in my home and in my office, even though I
didn't know how to use them,&quot; says Jose Carlos Luque Otero, president
of the Lima stockmarket. &quot;None of that is necessary any longer.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The success of Fujimori's security programme is such that he won a landslide
victory in elections last April, guaranteeing him control of the congress.
And the official economy has attracted about $5 billion in foreign direct
investment in 1995, a sign of growing confidence in Peru. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There is probably considerably more coming in than that,&quot; explains
economist Gilberto Moncada, who works for the Lima research and consulting
firm Cuanto SA. &quot;Requirements for registering foreign investment with
the ministry of the economy have been eliminated, so it is increasingly
difficult to keep track of the actual amount.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Out of all foreign investors, Spain continues to invest the most money in
Peru, sinking $2 billion in 1994 according to Cuanto: the takeover by Spain's
Telefonica of the Peruvian telecommunications provider helps account for
most of that large investment). The US, the Netherlands, Chile, and Britain
follow, with companies investing heavily in mining and energy. <BR>
<BR>
The government's privatisation programme accounts for most of that investment.
Since 1992 the government has seen $3.54 billion in receipts from its sales
of almost all state-owned industry. There are further large sales to come,
including the remaining shares in the telephone company, electric power
utilities and the oil company Perupetro. <BR>
<BR>
Foreign companies have accounted for about half of privatisation revenues
but the influx of capital has also posed a problem. Peru's current account
deficit, $2.1 billion in 1994, is growing rapidly as imports mount. &quot;There
is a genuine danger here of a crisis,&quot; says Moncada. &quot;If there
is a popular notion that the country's reserves are being depleted, a run
on the banks is always possible. This is part of the heritage of having
suffered high inflation.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The government insists that export generation will soon balance the trade
deficit. Says Peru's finance minister Jorge Camet: &quot;Some 32% of 1995
imports were capital goods. Investments in the mining sector are expected
to mature in two or three years time, thus generating a significant increase
in exports that will lead to a trade surplus before the end of the century.&quot;
Economists are less sure, and in any case are more concerned about the short
term. <BR>
<BR>
To its credit, the Fujimori government has earned a reputation for responsibility
in its monetary policies. The IMF praises the government for sticking to
planned spending cuts over a period of two years and Peru enjoys the advantage
of having finally normalised its commercial debt. <BR>
<BR>
Last summer the country came to an agreement with international bankers
to resettle payments on the $10 billion it owes. The accord means the end
of a dispute that has hurt the country's credit since 1983, when the preceding
Garcia administration declared a moratorium on debt servicing. <BR>
<BR>
A recent agreement under the Brady plan, named after a former US treasury
secretary, will allow Peru to begin servicing the debt again. A single payment
of $225 million has been determined to satisfy the bankers and servicing
will take place at the rate of about $22 million per quarter. This sizeable
discount will prevent repayments from becoming an intolerable burden. The
government calculates that overall commercial debt has been cut by about
half, an amount similar to the terms won by Ecuador and Poland in recent
Brady deals. <BR>
<BR>
When debt servicing does begin again in 1996, critics say it could have
a serious effect on growth. But the amount of money entering the country
through foreign investment seems to be <BR>
sufficient to compensate the drain. <BR>
<BR>
Until exports can be improved, the privatisation programme ensures that
the government will be able to maintain reserves. Currently, exports consist
mostly of raw materials like minerals, fish, and agricultural produce. Mining,
perhaps Peru's largest and most advanced industry, will enjoy close to $10
billion in investment to improve productivity in the next five years. But
little is being spent to improve other areas of the economy like high-tech
manufacturing. <BR>
<BR>
Here the problems created by the highly restrictive nature of Peru's economic
success become important: to make exports more competitive, the country
needs a larger, better-educated workforce. A greater number of competitive
enterprises must also be created and that also calls for more entrepreneurs
with education and skills. &quot;Unless the rewards of our booming economy
are used to invest in education and training, the boom could fizzle out,&quot;
says Moncada. <BR>
<BR>
The third Peru is the group that cries out for this kind of help. Today,
Andean migrants make up the majority of Lima's population and are a hotbed
of entrepreneurial talent. They are important as both consumers and producers:
one economist described them as having &quot;an unlimited amount of unsatisfied
appetites&quot;. Since the government simplified the rules for starting
new businesses last year, for example, some 450,000 new companies have been
registered, the vast majority from this sector. Fujimori himself has paid
tribute to their creativity, which he says is symbolised by the Gamarra
textile district in Lima. <BR>
<BR>
A segment of Peruvian business now targets this group. Companies like the
Lima-based Grupo Carsa are finding ways to give credit to migrants on the
black economy who are learning to get housing mortgages and financing for
business expansion. &quot;What the government is beginning to understand,&quot;
says Guido Lucioni, executive director of the Grupo Carsa, &quot;is that
this black economy complements, and does not necessarily conflict with,
the traditional economy.&quot; Yet there is little likelihood such people
will receive the training they need: the mechanisms that would provide training
do not yet exist, nor are there any plans to put them into place. <BR>
<BR>
The Fujimori government cannot be accused of neglecting social spending.
It has actually increased under Fujimori's regime, from $12 per capita in
1990 to $176 per capita this year. &quot;The government has placed special
emphasis on its social programme, which considers directing at least 40%
of the annual budget in social spending until the year 2,000,'' says finance
minister Camet. But the relief has been short-term - free meals, subsidised
jobs - at the expense of steps which would make the poor more self-reliant.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Frustration v prosperity </B><BR>
<BR>
The result is disenfranchisement. Despite Peru's phenomenal economic growth
in 1994, the distribution of wealth that year increased only 0.8% according
to Cuanto. The government claims growth in the next two years will spread
more wealth: &quot;The growth rate will be significantly higher than the
expected increase in population and will be enough to generate a real increase
in the population's living standards,&quot; says finance minister Camet.
But while terrorism is now under control, street crime is rising, especially
in the shantytowns around big cities. The frustration of the disenfranchised
mounts with other people's prosperity. <BR>
<BR>
Many of the problems are caused by a logjam at the top, as is so often the
case in a highly centralised regime. In the so-called coup of April 5, 1992,
Fujimori closed down the country's congress and took over every kind of
decision-making. Few Peruvians regret the uprising, since the congress had
a deserved reputation for corruption. But although democratic institutions
once again operate in the country, Fujimori has never really given back
all decision-making powers. Ministers reportedly fear taking steps without
express approval from the president who has shut down some regional governments
and begun naming regional presidents himself. There are still 37 provinces
in which military rule has never been replaced by a civilian administration.
<BR>
<BR>
The government insists that it will broaden democracy. Finance minister
Camet says: &quot;Democratic institutions play a key role in allowing Peruvians
to feel that the main issues and decisions are based on the majority's will.&quot;
Yet it is clear that political power at every level depends on Fujimori
himself. Although unable to run in the next presidential elections in 2005,
he is reportedly already choosing a successor. <BR>
<BR>
With all this, Peru's considerable economic success makes for optimism.
The government now has the means to guarantee stability and set change in
motion in many areas. &quot;We are enjoying peace and prosperity for the
first time in years,&quot; says one Lima businessman. &quot;We need time
to get used to it, and then we can get started on the rest of the work we
have to do.&quot;<BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>
<H4></H4>
<H3><A NAME="banks-sale"></A>SMART BANKS FOR SALE</H3>
<BR>
<B>Privatisation and looser regulation have begun to make banks very interesting
to foreign investors </B><BR>
<BR>
Peru was largely spared from the round of bank failures that many other
Latin American countries saw in 1994. Since 1992, the country has had a
strict law which obliges Peruvian banks to clean up bad loans and keep capital
ratios high. The result is that the banking sector has enjoyed the fruits
of the economic boom. &quot;Essentially, banks are profiting from the reaction
after 15 years of pent-up growth,&quot; says one local banker. <BR>
<BR>
At the moment, the sector is still comparatively small. The total amount
of bank-to-bank transactions accounts for only about 20% of the country's
GNP according to Cuanto SA, a Lima-based research and consulting firm, compared
to Chile's 40%. One problem is excessive concentration: just a handful of
banks account - mainly large state-owned institutions with privileged access
to credit - for more than half of total deposits. <BR>
<BR>
But this is changing rapidly. In 1993 Banco Internacional, the country's
fourth largest bank, was was sold to a Peruvian consortium with some foreign
interests for $51 million. Since then three other large state banks have
been privatised and more sales are planned.The country's privatisation programme
and booming economy have provoked considerable foreign interest while the
relatively high level of development of Peruvian banking, has offered a
further incentive. <BR>
<BR>
More than 20 foreign banks have set up representative offices in Lima in
the past year. Last April, a consortium led by Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
bought the former state-owned Banco Continental for nearly $200 million
and Spain's Banco Santander, which bid unsuccessfully for Continental, is
reportedly eyeing the smaller Banco Mercantil del Peru. Analysts expect
Santander to make several purchases to continue its strategy of regional
development. Citibank is already active in the country and the Netherland's
ING Group has also declared interest in making a purchase in Peru. <BR>
<BR>
Chilean groups set up three new banks in Lima in 1994: Banco del Libertador,
Banco Solventa, and Banco del Trabajo. A new Peruvian bank, Banco del Nuevo
Mundo, started operations in 1993. <BR>
<BR>
Commercial banking is the most developed area with 21 institutions currently
operating. The recent settlement of a large part of the nation's commercial
debt has opened the door to easier terms for corporate credit. Companies
are now paying high rates - up to 15% - on the very short-term loans available.
But banks are currently seeking funds to use in long-term loans at more
attractive rates. <BR>
<BR>
The state has recently taken measures to enable retail banks to offer consumer
credit at competitive rates and several Lima banks are already offering
such loans. Banks are also permitted to issue mortgage-backed notes for
up to 75% of property value and these are traded on Lima's secondary market:
techniques like securitisation have not yet found their way to Peru. Furthermore,
Visa has just installed 200,000 teller machines around the country to help
satisfy short-term credit demands. <BR>
<BR>
Peruvian banks are also moving into new areas of the capital markets that
been little cultivated so far in Latin America, such as derivatives. These
products, which are now growing fast, are typically interest rates and currency
related intruments linked to international capital market issues or spun
off from government or Brady bonds. The use of commodity-related derivatives
is also growing. The Lima bourse is currently working to create a better-regulated
trading environment for these products. <BR>
<BR>
All of Peru's major banks have been improving productivity, reorientating
employees to the priorities of a service industry. According to the Escuela
Superior de Economia y Negocios, a leading Lima business school, banks have
already raised productivity by an average 19% and operating costs are being
slashed. The Lima-based Banco Wiese leads the country's productivity league
table, according to the business school, followed closely by the largest
bank, Banco de Credito. <BR>
<BR>
Peru's banking boom is likely to last as long as the economic boom continues.
Still, with the entry of so many new players into a fairly small market,
analysts say a shakeout can be expected in the next two years. Peruvian
banks may now be getting lean and mean, but they will have to get even tougher
as growth slows in 1996 and 1997. <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>

<H3><A NAME="mining"></A>GOLD, SILVER AND ZINC </H3>
<BR>
<B>The mining industry is ripe for adventurous investors, with many unexplored
areas rich with deposits </B><I><BR>
<BR>
by Andrew Rosenbaum </I><BR>
<BR>
One of the largest zinc mines in Latin America is being built in Peru. The
Isaycruz mine will begin operations in 1996, with a capacity of 60,000 tons,
heralding a positive future for the country's mining industry. <BR>
<BR>
The Peruvian economy already obtains a quarter of its total growth from
mining revenues, which come from gold, silver, copper and zinc <BR>
production. Mining accounts for 11% of GDP and the trickle-down effect of
investment in the sector is becoming increasingly important for the country.
&quot;Peru is becoming a Mecca for geologists and mining companies,&quot;
comments Ronald Cambre, president and CEO of Newmont Mining. <BR>
<BR>
The removal of state controls on industry has allowed the sector to develop
freely, and both investment and development are taking off. Procedures for
registering properties have been relaxed and foreign investors are offered
a tax stability contract, which guarantees the effective rate of taxation
on profits for the life of the project and which assures the entrepreneur
of unrestricted repatriation of profits. The government has also adopted
an environmental impact statement as a means of protecting natural resources
and standardising the procedure for project approval. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Acres of unexplored land </B><BR>
<BR>
Equally important is the existence of a highly skilled workforce. Peruvian
mining engineers, industry observers say, are thoroughly familiar with modern
techniques. Production is currently worth $1.6 billion and by the year 2003
this figure is expected to triple to $4.8 billion. In the past two years,
the number of registered applications for new mining ventures has increased
dramatically to more than 8,000. <BR>
<BR>
In total, the industry now covers 19 thousand hectares. Yet according to
the ministry of energy and mining, only 5% of the total area available for
the industry is being exploited. The ministry has details of thousands of
untouched deposits which are open to exploitation. The eastern part of the
country, which is reportedly rich with mining opportunities, has not yet
even been mapped. <BR>
<BR>
With all this potential the prospects for investment in Peruvian mining
look good, according to analysts. Investment of close to $9 billion is expected
over the next 10 years. One catalyst is the privatisation of Centromin,
the state-owned mining giant, which is scheduled for 1996. The company is
valued at more than $1 billion and owns gold, silver and other mines. It
produces much of the silver mined in the country, which itself is the third
largest producer of silver in the world. Its privatisation should stimulate
further investment in silver mining and provide the company with funds to
expand its current operations and exploration. Foreign companies like Cyprus
and Newmont mining are already present in the country and are keen to make
future investment. <BR>
<BR>
Centromin was a particular target of attacks by the Shining Path terrorist
group: in 1988 the company lost 8.3 million man-hours because of attacks.
It is now recuperating and produced 18.4 million ounces of silver in 1994.
<BR>
<BR>
Extensive exploration for gold deposits is taking place in the mountains.
Gold production is the largest sector of the mining industry, worth a total
$338 million in 1994, and it is expected to grow by more than half in 1995.
Peru boasts the largest and most profitable gold mine in Latin America,
the Minera Yanacocha, where two sites are now in production, which alone
produced close to 300,000 ounces in 1994. The amount is increasing through
high-tech chemical production methods. Two other mines were also recently
opened and should spur production. <BR>
<BR>
The smaller mining operations also present excellent investment opportunities,
as entrepreneurs in this sector lack capital to explore the vast wooded
areas of the mountains. <BR>
<BR>
Copper makes up 18% of Peru's total exports and there are reportedly large
areas of unexplored copper deposits in the eastern part of the country.
A gradual fall in the value of copper is expected in the long-term, but
this should not affect performance. Most of the country's copper comes from
two mines in the south of Peru. Both are mined by the Southern Peru Copper
Corporation, which is owned by a consortium of foreign and national companies.<BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>

<H3><A NAME="busy-bourse"></A>BOURSE BUSY WITH IDEAS </H3>
<B>The resurgent and welcoming Lima stock exchange is prospering, despite
weak laws controlling insider trading <BR>
<BR>
</B><I>by Andrew Rosenbaum </I><BR>
<BR>
When the Mexican crisis drove investors away from Latin America and emerging
markets in general, the Lima stockmarket suffered, experiencing an outflow
of several hundred million dollars. But the money came back to the exchange
within two months, in the fastest recovery in Latin America. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We had no 'tequila effect' here,&quot; says Jose Carlos Luque Otero,
president of the Lima stockmarket, referring to the knock-on effects of
the peso devaluation in December 1994 which hit other countries in the region
for months afterwards. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Star performer in Latin America </B><BR>
<BR>
The Lima bourse is a superb showcase for the government's economic reforms.
It acts an important instrument of monetary policy, enabling the economy
to absorb the vast funds that are flowing into the country via the privatisation
programme and other investments. <BR>
<BR>
The stockmarket has outperformed all other Latin American stockmarkets since
the Mexican crisis. In the past three years, share prices have risen more
then 10 times and the exchange's IGBVL index has risen from 130 in 1992
to a high of around 1500 in 1994. <BR>
<BR>
The government's privatisation programme has swollen total trading volume
which is expected to rise to $15 billion in 1996, up from $750 million six
in 1990. About half of that volume comes from foreign equity investment
through the purchase of shares of recently privatised companies. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;All of this is due to the government's achievement of economic and
social stability,&quot; says Luque Otero. &quot;And I think the stockmarket
will continue to develop as long as this lasts.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The most serious difficulty the exchange has faced came when Peru had armed
clashes with neighbouring Ecuador in 1995 over a border dispute. &quot;That
frightened investors but happily the war did not last very long.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Lima has had a stock exchange for the past 135 years, but under previous
governments its operations were hampered by a welter of regulations. &quot;When
we were given the go-ahead in 1991 we reorganised the exchange, modelling
it after Chicago and copying SEC rules,&quot; Luque Otero explains, refering
to the tough American Securities and Exchange Commission which regulates
the equity markets. <BR>
<BR>
The one important exception, however, is on insider trading where the Lima
market did not accept the American model, choosing instead to base its rules
on French law which is notoriously weak on the issue. This may help to explain
why no case on insider trading has ever been tried in Peru. Some analysts
have called this a serious weakness and have called for the Peruvian stockmarket
watchdog, the National Committee for Stocks and Bonds, to change the rule.
<BR>
<BR>
Apart from this lapse, the Lima market operates according to the highest
international standards, based on the Group of 15 recommendations that govern
the industry. Trading is entirely electronic and all the issues are dematerialised
- that is they exist only on computer. Settlement takes place two days after
a trade, which is the same as in many of the world's principal stockmarkets.
There is no market-making at present, although Luque Otero says that he
is studying the possibilities for its introduction. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The short queue of foreign brokers </B><BR>
<BR>
One of the Lima exchange's most unusual aspects is its openness to foreign
brokers. Foreign firms are allowed to become members and have unrestricted
access to trading on the Lima exchange, a fact which is true of very few
stockmarkets in developing countries around the world. <BR>
<BR>
Barings, Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers are already members. While Luque
Otero says foreign brokers are not exactly queuing up to join the exchange,
he insists that he is talking to other houses. <BR>
<BR>
The Lima stockmarket is expanding into new areas, building on its past progress
and good reputation. Last year a small market for corporate bonds, worth
no more than $5 million, made its appearance. The bond market is now worth
$500 million as corporations perceive that there is sufficient liquidity
on the exchange to make such fundraising operations worthwhile. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Worries about handling big money </B><BR>
<BR>
Some economists are concerned, however, that there are still not enough
large players present to handle ever-larger influxes of capital. &quot;The
bourse is helping the economy handle about $100 million per month,&quot;
says Waldemar de Moraes, director of the IMF office in Lima. &quot;But if
that goes to $200 million per month Peru will need another means to handle
the overflow.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Luque Otero does not entirely agree with this assessment: &quot;Given the
interest we've aroused in foreign investors, there are no limits to what
we can do. I foresee the exchange going to $100 <BR>
billion trading volume in a few years without any difficulty.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The stockmarket is also working to expand its second market, the Mesa del
Negociacion, a particular type of money market on which a few small companies
are traded as well. Today the Mesa del Negociacion sees about $3 to $4 million
of trading each day. <BR>
<BR>
Lima has no over-the-counter market but Luque Otero is trying to create
a small market for high-risk stocks, similar to those that exist in London
and Paris. The Lima stockmarket has already commissioned two technicians
to begin designing the new market but it is too early, he adds, to decide
how it will be organised. <BR>
<BR>
Accords have also been signed with exchanges in Thailand, Singapore, Barcelona
and Madrid for cooperation. But for the time being, the Lima stockmarket
does not contemplate placing terminals in other financial capitals such
as New York or London. <p>

<H2>RUSSIA </H2>
<H4>Despite the worst predictions at home and abroad, Russia continues to
follow the reform road and develop a taste for enterprising contact with
the outside world, even in the least promising places. Now it is time for
both the new Russian elite and the west to shift emphasis from economy to
society, and raise public trust by making the new landscape more fair <BR>

<B>The state can learn from its own citizens, who often show real initative
and a healthy scepticism<BR>
<BR>
</B><I>by Craig Mellow </I><BR>
<BR>
The final irony of eastern Europe's liberation decade, it seems, is that
in most places it takes a communist election victory to launch definitively
the era of post-communist politics. If communists themselves do not dream
of bringing back communism, it must have gone for good. <BR>
<BR>
Gennady Zyuganov and his cohorts in the Communist Party of the Russian Federation
emerged as the biggest party in December's parliamentary election. But they
will not be able to turn the clock back. Three Russian parliaments in a
row have been accused of being soft on reform, since they axed the reformist
shock therapist Yegor Gaidar as prime minister in December 1992 and replaced
him with the supposed reactionary Viktor Chernomyrdin. Yet Russian reform
keeps rolling along. <BR>
<BR>
Even so, the Russian version of market democracy has been a poor advertisement
for that form of social organisation. The new order is no fairer than the
communist one but it is much greedier. It has created new opportunities
for those fastest on their feet but has temporarily diminished the prospects
for an average person seeking a decent education and dignified job. Democracy
has brought a traditionally egalitarian society to extremes of wealth and
poverty. To ordinary people, merit plays no part in this. <BR>
<BR>
The key to the next five years in Russia will lie in the behaviour of the
new elite which has consolidated power over the past five years. It is a
pan-ideological group of bankers and industry bosses, public officials and
criminals whose interests have drawn ever closer together. Its interests
are increasingly distant, however, from those of the population at large.
Dietmar Studemann, minister plenipotentiary at the German Embassy in Moscow,
recently commented: &quot;We are witnessing in the Russian elites a complete
lack of responsibility to society. Therefore I look at Russia's immediate
future without much optimism.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Measuring an elite's responsibility to society is much more complicated
than keeping tabs on budget deficits and inflation. Key indicators include
such subtleties as the struggle for the rule of law or maintaining an education
system which was the Soviet Union's finest achievement. If the new elite
does congeal into one more Russian court dividing the spoils secretly among
its members, the country will stagnate or worse. The new order has no mystical
veil of legitimacy like the Romanovs or communists, and the public is not
as ignorant as it used to be. <BR>
<BR>
The outlook may not be as gloomy as Studemann suggests. There is still room
at the middle, if not the top, for new faces with energy and talent and
there has been an unexpected explosion of entrepreneurial energy. Communism
was good at teaching people how to hustle for survival. Management skills
may not always be the most refined, but ordinary Russians have raced ahead
of their government. The state continues to live in terror of the mass unemployment
which is supposed to result from shutting bankrupt factories. But the workforce
at most plants is long gone, fending for itself elsewhere. Important exceptions
are company towns like Magnitogorsk or Norilsk (see page 191). <BR>
<BR>
Another positive element is the devolution of economic power from Moscow
ministries to factory floors. Few privatised Russian enterprises bear much
relation yet to investor-held corporations. But the local director now stands
a better chance of improving the company than a bureaucrat thousands of
miles away. Admittedly, the first instinct of many bosses was to exploit
their property. But with old inventories gone and the government tough on
credit, the smarter bosses are forced into a more businesslike approach.
<BR>
<BR>
Regional government is also wresting ever more revenue and power from the
centre, which foreign business representatives think all to the good. &quot;The
ministry men in Moscow can be totally removed from reality.&quot; observes
Stuart Swanson, Russia country manager for the US pharmaceutical firm Pfizer.
<BR>
<BR>
Then there are Russia's already strong links to the outside world. From
the industrial baron trotting the globe to the babushka who lives for her
daily episode of the American soap opera Santa Barbara, almost every citizen
has some reason to cherish the open borders of freedom. A Japanese television
set is material aspiration number one for the masses, while slightly better
earners dream of Italian washing machines and beach holidays in Turkey.
<BR>
<BR>
Russians are all for the national interest on abstract matters like Nato
expansion or selling the state oil companies. But to take away those things
which the world now offers would be bitterly unpopular. A further cause
for hope is the dismantling of much, if not all, of the totalitarian machine.
<BR>
<BR>
There are huge problems. While the violent criminality of gangsters grabs
the headlines it is the brazen criminality of the ruling authorities which
has most damaged the social fabric. The brief shining moment of 1990-91,
when for the first time in history Russians felt they might play a part
in their own government, has faded away. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Every week [the authorities] dream up some new agency,&quot; complains
a plastics factory director in the city of Rybinsk, north of Moscow. &quot;If
I make a red pail instead of a blue pail, I have to get approval for it.&quot;
To much of the population, the new order is perfect proof of what the communists
taught them all their lives -- that all riches are by definition stolen
from the poor. <BR>
<BR>
It is nearly impossible to obey the law and make a profit in Russia -- the
tax code sees to that. Excessive rates hurt the state because everybody
evades them. Worse still, they give officials and gangsters grounds to blackmail
virtually every business operator in the country. But despite everything,
businesses are normalising their operations and paying staff by bank transfer
rather than cash, making taxation at source more viable. Together with the
closure of other loopholes this could bring profits tax and VAT, currently
at 35% and 21% respectively, closer to European levels. <BR>
<BR>
At the company level, Russian manufacturers have largely failed to translate
their cheap labour into a cost advantage over imports. They continue to
make inferior goods at only slightly reduced prices, and entire sectors
have accordingly been wiped out. This cannot be blamed on the government,
whose tariff policy has walked a fairly reasonable line between producer
and consumer. <BR>
<BR>
The authorities are more directly at fault for continued stagnation in Russia's
huge agricultural sector, which still employs up to a quarter of the population.
An aggressive programme of credit for private farmers was quickly abandoned
as expensive and prone to fraud. The real reason was the hostility of the
powerful kolkhoz or collective farm lobby, which manages to suck plenty
of cash down its own black hole. <BR>
<BR>
The means of tackling these problems are yet to be developed. But the state
must find some way to put its officials beyond the reach of corruption and
establish trust between citizen and state. Apart from tax changes, both
commercial efficiency and social justice would be greatly served by strengthening
Russia's court system which the communists left a withered stump and which
the average citizen desperately needs as a watchdog. The world community
could do its bit by showing Russian lawyers some of the loving care, such
as know-how programmes, it has so far concentrated on economics. <BR>
<BR>
Above all, the outside world might best aid its cause by shifting support
from Russian reform to Russian democracy. Foreign business was jubilant
when the first parliament was crushed in October 1993 and Yeltsin ruled
by decree for nearly a year. Yet Russia's legislators have grown rapidly
in competence and sobriety while the Kremlin lives in an increasingly opaque
world. &quot;Personally I prefer dealing with the Duma,&quot; notes Vladimir
Volodin, president of the US-Russian consulting firm Impact Russia. &quot;I
can walk in the door, find a deputy and talk to him. Try doing that with
any ministry official above the level of toilet cleaner.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The country got a second chance at freedom because Yeltsin was big enough
not to take absolute power after the 1993 October Events. The December 1995
election was a fine display of democratic process. If this second chance
is muffed, the third may be a long time coming.<BR><BR> <HR WIDTH=60%>
<H4></H4>
<H3><A NAME="vladivostock"></A>MEET THE NEW RELATIONS </H3>
<B>With the collapse of Moscow-led central planning, Russia's eastern rim
is looking to its Asian neighbours</B> <BR>
<BR>
It is easy to forget just how big Russia is. The eastern outpost of Vladivostok,
seven time zones and more than 6,000 km away from Moscow, may be politically
and culturally European. But geographically, and now economically, this
is east Asia. <BR>
<BR>
With the collapse of central planning, distances inside the federation have
acquired an entirely new meaning. Gone are the days of cheap railway fares
and centralised distribution that tied Russia's Far East firmly to Europe.
This vast region, bordering China and North Korea and a short hop from Japan,
is increasingly looking to the Pacific rim countries for economic salvation.
<BR>
<BR>
The figures speak for themselves. In 1994 trade with China, Japan and South
Korea accounted for 77% of trade in Primorski krai, Russia's Far Eastern
maritime region of which Vladivostok is the capital. The evidence is everywhere
on the streets. There is hardly a left-hand drive car to be seen in Vladivostok.
Russian Volgas and Zhigulis were long ago outnumbered by Japanese-made Toyotas
and Hondas whose right-hand drive construction adds another ingredient to
the city's crazy traffic. <BR>
<BR>
A look at the shops reveals few of the European products that are everywhere
in Moscow or Petersburg. Instead Vladivostok has a Chinese market, kiosks
brimming with imports from Korea and shops full of consumer electronics
from Japan. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Miso soup, not hamburgers </B><BR>
<BR>
Seek out a hotel built to international standards and Vladivostok will offer
you one Canadian-owned motel and three joint ventures backed by Japanese
or Chinese money. The story is much the same in the city's restaurants.
If you want Miso soup, there is no problem; a decent hamburger or lasagne
is rather more complicated. Everywhere you look, it is east Asian products
that have hit the market first, with those of the US, Canada, Australia
and New Zealand following on. <BR>
<BR>
This is not surprising. Geography dictates that trade with the east is bound
to increase in importance although the west coast of the US and Canada have
recently woken up to the opportunities in the Russian Far East and there
are even flights from Vladivostok and Khabarovsk to Anchorage and Seattle.
Not only do Asian neighbours have the advantage of proximity, and thus price,
but they are also keenly aware of the region's importance as a route to
the vast Russian market and a source of the raw materials they crave. <BR>
<BR>
Timber, non-ferrous metals, soon-to-be developed oilfields in Sakhalin Island
and above all fish are among the Russian Far East's major resources. It
is home to some of the world's largest fishing companies and close to the
big fish markets of Japan and Korea. &quot;This year there was 30% growth
in the fishing industry, despite an overall fall in the country. We believe
this is one of the major opportunities in the region,&quot; says Victor
Tumanov, head of ING Bank's representative office in Vladivostok. <BR>
<BR>
Yet for all its massive potential the Far East is still firmly at the &quot;opportunities&quot;
stage, especially as far as ordinary citizen is concerned. Most trade earnings,
particularly in natural resources, have gone to a few companies, with no
noticeable gain for ordinary folk. <BR>
<BR>
Vladivostok has developed a &quot;wild east&quot; reputation as a crime-ridden
mafia gangland, often compared to Chicago in the '20s. Although this image
is often exaggerated, it is certainly true that a small group of individuals
continue to control a large proportion of the local economy and have little
interest in spreading prosperity to the community as a whole. Furthermore,
the region has suffered substantially from the collapse of traditional supply
lines and from being so distant from the seat of power. <BR>
<BR>
Even in relatively prosperous Vladivostok, the standard of living is below
much of western Russia. This is a region with very little agriculture or
industry of its own. But just as the region no longer sends its precious
resources westward, so western Russia and Siberia no longer provide the
goods sent to the Far East in Soviet times. <BR>
<BR>
The most obvious example is coal. Towns and villages in the region suffer
regular power cuts, sometimes for several hours a day, because the power
stations can no longer afford to buy and transport enough coal from other
parts of Russia. The story is similar with other Russian products, exacerbated
by an inefficient payments system within the country and high rates of interest.
As Andrew Fox, head of a Vladivostok-based broking and investment company,
puts it: &quot;Interest rates are a cost for distances in Russia. High interest
rates are a penalty for long distances.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Former isolation made change harder </B><BR>
<BR>
It is also easy to forget, looking at Vladivostok today, that this was a
closed city just three years ago with restricted access not just for foreigners
but for non-native Russians. Vladivostok was the eastern fortress, home
to the powerful Pacific fleet. Everything else, including the development
of trade, was secondary, and this made economic change all the harder when
it came. There are other problems: this is still Russia, with all the attendant
difficulties of doing business like high taxes, lack of security and difficult
finance. <BR>
<BR>
For all these reasons the Far Eastern economy has developed more slowly
than some people hoped in the optimistic days of the early '90s. South Korean
giant Hyundai is by far the most active company in the region. The company
is building a $50 million complex of hotels, offices and shops in central
Vladivostok which it hopes will form the heart of the new business district.
But progress has been slow on the project, which began construction in July.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our investment at this stage is just a matter of goodwill.,&quot;
says Oh Soo-Kwoon, Hyundai's manager in Vladivostok. &quot;We've already
had to pay $20 million in federal taxes. Nobody knows when the centre will
be finished, maybe in one and a half years. Our relationship with the local
administration is very good - we have an exemption from all local taxes
- but federal tax laws are very difficult.&quot; In addition, investment
and finance regulations have made most potential investors cautious about
the Far East. &quot;Other parts of Russia may have more government guarantees
and support,&quot; says ING's Tumanov. &quot;Here everything is just beginning.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Choi Yong Sam, South Korea's consul overseeing economic affairs in Vladivostok,
is also wary. &quot;Most Korean companies are not engaged directly in trade
but have Russian partners. The regulations here are very changeable and
it's difficult to make a strategy,&quot; he says. &quot;There are also security
problems in the port and in transit which make things difficult if Koreans
handle things directly,&quot; Choi adds in a diplomatic reference to mafia
influence at the port. <BR>
<BR>
But for all such teething problems almost everyone is optimistic, even bullish,
about the future of the Far East and port cities like Vladivostok and Nakhodka,
the main tanker terminal. The latter has a free zone area which is being
developed in conjunction with the South Korean government. The idea is to
attract more manufacturing and processing to the area and encourage further
development of the port. <BR>
<BR>
<B>More modest Tumen river project </B><BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, there is a grand UN-sponsored project based around the river
Tuman at the point where the Russian, North Korean and Chinese borders meet
in southern Primorski krai. The Tuman river project was originally driven
by the Chinese, who wanted access to the sea via the Tuman river. But in
the five years since the project was mooted it has changed shape considerably.
The initial idea of building a brand new international port city on the
Tuman and dredging and widening the river has been abandoned as too expensive.
Now it concerns the construction of new rail links to existing ports in
North Korea and Russia which would then be further developed. <BR>
<BR>
An international project of this kind is seen as an excellent way of developing
the whole region by combining local resources, such as raw materials from
Russia, cheap labour from China and North Korea and know-how from more developed
South Korea. <BR>
<BR>
The Russian port of Zarubino in southern Primorski krai has been picked
for development because of its deep bay. Rail links to China are already
being built, using a Chinese railway gauge so that goods will not have to
be unloaded and reloaded at the border. Japan is particularly interested
in the Zarubino project as a route for Chinese grain to Japan. But in the
longer term Zarubino could also serve as an alternative route for east-west
trade, by offering a shorter route to Europe via China than the trans-Siberian
railway now on offer. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Still far from the power centre </B><BR>
<BR>
This is one reason why Russia has remained rather equivocal about the project,
while officially supporting it. &quot;Nakhodka and Vladivostok don't want
to see Zarubino developed,&quot; says Sergei Verolainin at the USAID office
in Vladivostok, who was involved with the scheme while in local government.
<BR>
<BR>
Verolainin also attributes Russia's foot-dragging to distance. &quot;Foreign
affairs people who know the project well do understand its significance,
but for most in the government it's not very important because it's small
and so far away,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
This is symptomatic of another traditional issue in this part of the country:
the balance of power between the centre and the periphery. For all the erosion
of central authority Moscow still ultimately controls what goes on in the
regions, including the Far East. As the democratic process develops in Russia
and regional governors are elected rather than appointed by the president,
the balance of power is starting to shift. The process has begun already
with the election of Yevgeni Nazdratenko as governor of Primorski krai.
&quot;Being elected rather than appointed will help him to be more influential
in Moscow,&quot; says Tumanov. <BR>
<BR>
Shifts in power towards the regions could also speed development of the
local economy. There are occasional rumblings about greater autonomy or
even independence, but no serious moves in that direction. The great popularity
of Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra- nationalist party in the Far East in recent
elections is no accident. There may be some resentment against the Moscow
bosses, but the fear of a big neighbour like China is much stronger. <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, the Far East can feel more enthusiastic about its integration into
the Pacific rim economy because it is part of Russia. The region's major
trading partner is Japan, although most investment comes from Korean companies.
&quot;The Japanese and Americans are watching how it is going, they are
more risk-averse,&quot; says Choi at the Korean consulate. And he says there
is less baggage in relations between Russia and Korea, a reference to the
absence of old scores like the Cold War or Russia's dispute with Japan over
the Kuril Islands. <BR>
<BR>
The Korean government has placed considerable emphasis on the Russian Far
East. Government help with the Nakhodka Free Zone, for example, should bring
advantages for Korean companies when it comes to international bidding for
construction and other projects in a few years. Seoul is also looking to
the day when its northern Korean neighbour will open up and allow goods
and people to move directly to Russia, instead of having to take roundabout
routes which avoid the currently hardline communist north. <BR>
<BR>
For the time being such hopes and projects remain part of a rosy future.
But for all today's hardships the future should bring great prosperity to
this strategically placed region. As Tumanov puts it: &quot;Although people
are not always happy with the life they have at the moment, these are the
times we are living in. It's important to have the opportunity to improve
things, and we certainly have that here.&quot;* <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>

<H3><A NAME="shipping"></A>SHIPPING NEWS <BR>
</H3>
<B>It is hard to find a venture in the Russian Far East in which the maritime
industry has no share</B>
It is the maritime sector that holds the greatest promise in the coastal
regions of the Russian Far East. The most powerful and successful companies
in the area are those involved in shipping, fishing and port facilities.
A handful of these major companies, like the Far Eastern Shipping Company
(Fesco), the Primorsk Shipping Company, DalMoreProdukt and the Vladivostok
and Nakhodka commercial ports, have such diversified investments that it
is hard to find a significant company or venture in the region free of their
involvement. <BR>
<BR>
Fesco, the region's premier company and Russia's largest dry cargo shipping
company, owns shares in Vladivostok's leading local bank, the fanciest hotel
in town, the Far East's biggest local newspaper group, the largest construction
company and a thriving regional airline. Moreover, this list is far from
exhaustive. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, even companies like Fesco have had their share of problems
since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The region's fishing and shipping
companies have had problems finding the money to build new vessels, something
once centrally funded from Moscow. Fesco's fleet now has an average age
of 17.5 years says Mikhail Yakimenko, <BR>
vice-president of finance and planning. &quot;That is very bad: 10 or 11
years would be good.&quot; The company has received credits from the European
Bank of Reconstruction and Development, as well as a number of other western
institutions, but this has not solved the problem. <BR>
<BR>
To make matters worse, Russia has seen a sudden hike in the price of bunkers
or shipping fuel, from well below world prices a year or so ago to some
15% above it now. &quot;The main costs for a shipping company are bunkers,
the cost of finance and crew wages. Russian shipowners have been hit on
all three items, and have to deal with a punitive tax regime to boot,&quot;
says Gavin Stoddart, Vladivostok director for accountant and international
shipping specialist Moore Stephens. <BR>
<BR>
The financial problems of the shipping and fishing sector have meant a bonanza
for some, like those agents who buy ships for scrap. In the last couple
of years an unprecedented number of ships have found their way to breakers'
yards in India and Bangladesh from the Russian Far East. Some are well under
20 years old, sold off by companies desperate for the cash to renovate or
repair the rest of their fleets. <BR>
<BR>
Despite these problems, most agree that the maritime sector has enormous
potential. &quot;If we weren't optimistic we wouldn't be here,&quot; says
Stoddart. &quot;That goes for all the foreign companies moving in.&quot;

<H3><A NAME="norilsk"></A>STILL US AND THEM? </H3>
A clever but controversial sell-off scheme at Norilsk Nickel prompted old
doubts - and a new consensus <BR>
<BR>
<I> by Craig Mellow </I><BR>
<BR>
They are suspicious of strangers at Norilsk Nickel; particularly these days.
This is part of the United Export-Import Bank, Oneksim, the fourth largest
and single most aggressive in a Russian financial world not renowned for
its corporate sissies. <BR>
<BR>
In November Oneksim - Unexim using the English abbreviation - bought 51%
of Norilsk Nickel's voting stock and 38% of total equity from the Russian
state at a cost of $170.1 million. Typically, the terms of the deal leave
it unclear whether Oneksim has become the company's owner, underwriter,
or lien-holder. But most people in Norilsk, and everybody in its management,
seems to prefer none of the above. <BR>
<BR>
You might think the climate in Norilsk, three degrees of latitude north
of the Arctic Circle, would keep the riff-raff out. A traveller touching
down on a December night is greeted by snow raging like a Sahara sandstorm.
The temperature might be unseasonably warm at -20&#186;C, but the wind is
elementally terrifying. Yet beneath this waste is one of the world's richest
seams of valuable metals. The company produces 20% of the world's nickel
supply, 40% of all metals in the platinum group and 70% of Russia's copper.
Vast stocks remain below the ground. As a result, ever since the city was
opened to outsiders under <I>perestroika</I>, the world has beaten a path
to Norilsk Nickel's door. <BR>
<BR>
The company's managers and workers, owners of most remaining shares, assume
that their <I>kombinat</I> is worth a fortune. In their minds only stupidity
and dirty dealing can explain the pittance that Oneksim paid. &quot;They
sold us, and sold us cheap,&quot; summarises Valery Glazkov, leader of Norilsk
Nickel's trade union. Immediately after the sale he and the city's new <I>Duma</I>
deputy, Viktor Sitnov, joined forces to collect proxy votes for an anticipated
showdown with Oneksim for control. <BR>
<BR>
Yet reason and finance do not always agree. Norilsk Nickel needs some expensive
repairs. Last winter a turbine cracked in the electric station which convict
labour threw up for emergency war production in 1942. The breakdown left
thousands of apartments without heat or electricity. The original nickel
smelter, also built during the war, still wheezes along. The copper works,
opened on Stalin's 70th birthday in 1949, is too small to accommodate contemporary
furnaces. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Monument to Soviet power </B><BR>
<BR>
The whole structure of Norilsk was a slap in the face to market economics.
It was dedicated as a monument to the capabilities of Soviet power. At a
dreadful cost, these did prove impressive. The town grew from naked tundra
in 1935 to a metropolitan area of 300,000 people with an excellent repertory
theatre, graduate institutes and one of Russia's best children's hospitals.
All of it is paid for by Norilsk Nickel and all of it, economically speaking,
is dead weight. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;At the Alaskan oil rigs there's nothing but some barracks for workers
who fly in temporarily,&quot; remarks one of the more thoughtful functionaries
at headquarters. &quot;Our model of the north, with families and kindergartens,
turns out to be mistaken.&quot; In Soviet times those families would stay
for three years and go home with enough money saved to buy a car. Or they
could stay 15 years and retire comfortably to somewhere warmer. Now, with
world prices holding sway on &quot;the mainland&quot; as the rest of the
land mass is known, they are trapped with nowhere to go. <BR>
<BR>
For all these reasons and more, financial logic holds that Oneksim Bank
paid a fair price for Norilsk Nickel, no more than $0.25 off the quoted
level of $3.80 per share. Norilsk Nickel is a bit extreme in location, but
essentially it is typical of the prize properties which the Moscow government
wants to transform in its second stage of privatisation: capital intensive
enterprises resemble a small kingdom as much as a corporation. They tend
to be hierarchical, conservative communities knit tightly together by survival
in harsh conditions, led by a proud but ageing management team which came
up through the ranks and which, while grudgingly admitting that outside
capital is essential, is determined to accept it on the enterprise's own
terms. <BR>
<BR>
Reformers in the Russian government have been running the industrial barons
to ground for years now. What is new and somewhat surprising is that resourceful
young banks have dealt themselves into the game as a potentially equal partner.
Free market ideologues will applaud this development as essential to the
efficiency of future investment. But given some of the questions still swirling
about the background and character of Oneksim and others like it, the citizens
of Norilsk are entitled to their doubts. <BR>
<BR>
Norilsk Nickel's management is bloated, employing 1,500 headquarters staff
for some 150,000 workers. Technically however, it is among the world's finest
and staff are head-hunted by far-flung competitors: the foreman who showed
this correspondent around the copper smelter had just been offered a job
in Chile at $8,000 per month, or at least 10 times his current salary. Norilsk
Nickel workers also have a better reputation than some for returning revenues
to the enterprise coffers. Yet they do have their blind spots, among which
is the idea that the <I>kombinat</I> could ever really slip out of their
control. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You tell all the banks that in three years the window for investing
in us will be closed,&quot; growls no-nonsense deputy director Boris Kazakov.
&quot;And then we'll remember who helped us,&quot; chimes in a public relations
adjutant. These are vintage Soviet sentiments, innocent of the notion that
investment might somehow change the definition of &quot;us&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Little innocence of any sort is to be found at the Moscow headquarters of
Oneksim Bank. This is a quintessential lair of the new Russia, full of harassed
executives who are 32 but look 45, men who become separated from their cellular
phones only in cases of national crisis. The bank's startling success since
opening its doors in 1993 seems to stem in equal parts from knowing what
it is doing and knowing whom to do it with. It married the capital of some
two dozen top hard-currency exporters, including Norilsk Nickel itself,
with the brightest young staff from the old Soviet Vneshekonombank among
other places. Government heavies including former finance minister Boris
Fyodorov presided over the wedding. <BR>
<BR>
<B>New but untried privatisation solution </B><BR>
<BR>
But the old boys created a monster beyond their control. This became more
apparent as the Russian government wrapped up its lightning voucher privatisation
programme and wondered how to move on to the second stage or cash privatisation.
The vouchers had more to do with decentralisation than privatisation. They
transferred control from ministries to managers, and sometimes well organised
employees, but failed to raise capital or change the way most plants were
run. Nor did the state make money from the process. <BR>
<BR>
Stage two was meant to be different, auctioning genuinely valuable enterprises
to actual investors for real money. Yet the government was caught between
two conflicting imperatives: the need to net a worthy sum from sale of the
crown jewels and the need to keep them out of foreign hands. With most Russia's
liquid capital secreted abroad, these conditions looked hard to fulfil.
<BR>
<BR>
Enter Oneksim Bank with its &quot;loans for shares&quot; scheme, a variation
of the debt-equity swop. The bank argued that the state could offload controlling
stakes in blue chip enterprises without dumping them on a market unprepared
to buy. Instead commercial banks would take the packets as &quot;collateral&quot;
on &quot;loans&quot; made to the government. The banks would then have three
years to create a secondary market, with 70% of any profit they made from
resale going back to the treasury. <BR>
<BR>
At first a consortium of nine banks proposed to take most of what was valuable
in Russia for a flat $2 billion. But this proved too much to stomach politically.
Instead, the state property committee decided to auction off the enterprises
separately. The bosses at Norilsk Nickel, like almost everywhere else, lobbied
Moscow hard to get off the list. They failed. <BR>
<BR>
The problem is that loans-for-shares is a complex procedure, unproved in
the Russian context, which no one has yet bothered to explain to the public.
The small minority which does grasp what is involved strongly suspects that
it has as much to do with securing senior bureaucrats' retirement nest-eggs
as with the national interest. <BR>
<BR>
The conduct of the early auctions hardly allayed that suspicion. Chaos became
inevitable when Oneksim Bank, already tipped as a major player, was also
charged with organising most of the bids. Trouble flared at the auction
when Oneksim helped disqualify a much higher bid ($355 million) from competitor
Rossiysky Kredit on the grounds that a central bank edict disqualified offers
in excess of the bidder's own capital. Given that Oneksim Bank quickly digested
oil giant Sidanco and still hungered for more, this logic seems niggling
at best. <BR>
<BR>
The next major auction, for the Yukos oil company, was also won by its organiser,
Bank Menatep. At this point Rossiysky Kredit, Inkombank and Alfa Bank, all
original consortium members, publicly demanded that the auctions be halted.
The squabbling, coming weeks before the December parliamentary elections,
was grist to the Communists' anti-market mill. <BR>
<BR>
The normally loquacious Oneksim Bank became defensive after the auction.
A spokesman insisted that the bank had not really bought the shares, but
had just taken them as security. At the same time, he sought to trumpet
a $1 billion investment plan developed jointly with the <I>kombinat</I>'s
management. Whose $1 billion this was and how exactly it would be used the
spokesman could not say. <BR>
<BR>
If Oneksim and the other banks cannot fulfill their pledges the state might
yet repurchase the shares and end the experiment. Yet the larger process
will not be so easily reversed. Boris Kazakov, the hard-bitten Arctic mining
boss, understands one thing that his trade unions do not: whatever hot air
is blown on the campaign trail, the Russian state will never again produce
the money which Norilsk Nickel needs. <BR>
<BR>
Nor does Kazakov want to be locked back up in a closed city with some central
committeeman from Moscow telling him how to run his business. So he swallows
his pride and flies off to hear the views of the Moscow bankers he so despises.
<BR>
<BR>
Back home in Norilsk, a glance through the classified ads shows that distance
cannot fend off what is happening all over Russia. Private estate agencies,
custom tailors, home repair contractors and stock brokers all hawk their
services. Travel agents offer junkets to destinations from Pattaya to Rome.
Like everywhere, sense is painfully drilling its way through the encrusted
layers of past insanity. <BR>
<BR>
Russia's natural riches require private capital made politically acceptable
by its Russian origins, put to work by local management and milked for tax
revenue by the state. Many of those involved already essentially accept
these ground rules. The state may waste a bit more time and money, but in
the end it is forced to do the same. A scant four years after the Soviet
Union's dissolution, such a degree of accord is quite an achievement in
itself.<BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>
<H4></H4>
<H3>THE SEVEN GENERALS </H3>
<B>Officially, the oil and gas industry is still in state hands, but its
leaders shaping up as potential partners </B><BR>
<BR>
When an oil spill by the state oil company Komineft caused one of history's
greatest ecological disasters last year in Russia's far north, management
reacted very curiously. It invited in the press, then petitioned the World
Bank for an emergency clean-up loan. The spill was mopped up within six
months, bank officials report. <BR>
<BR>
Such incidents signify a much larger trend. Phase one of the battle for
Russia's oil and gas wealth has largely ended. The inchoate, top-secret
state monolith has been broken down into six still-huge holding companies.
Although still formally in state hands, these firms call their own shots
and have privatisation very much on their minds. <BR>
<BR>
The comrades, seven of them if the gas industry behemoth Gazprom is included,
are far from models of modern management. Yet they provide a much firmer
base for partnership than a few years ago. And while they are quite capable
of wrapping themselves in the flag, they are keenly aware of the need to
attract capital from beyond Russia's borders. If the government ever tightens
up its tax and regulatory policy, large multinational energy projects may
become a reality over the next few years. <BR>
<BR>
When western firms arrived in Russia, the domestic industry's image was
one of helpless incompetence. Yet despite recent setbacks, the prevailing
spirit in Siberian oil towns like Nizhnevartovsk and Surgut is that of pioneering
pride, tersely expressed by Yuri Shafranik, Russia's energy minister and
former director of the production complex in Langepas. &quot;I built a city
from nothing, nil,&quot; Shafranik says. &quot;I'm not afraid of much.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
What they did not know about post-modern finance, the oil generals more
than compensated for with what they did know about Russian politics and
quietly stamped, sealed, and notarised their control over the nation's essential
wealth. <BR>
<BR>
Biggest, fastest and meanest of the oil companies is Lukoil, which merged
Shafranik's old Langepas enterprise with its giant neighbour at Kogalym
and a few smaller well heads. Lukoil has become Russian oil's face abroad,
most notably when it muscled its way into the $8 billion multinational consortium
wanting to drill in the Caspian Sea. Back home Lukoil has led the way in
bringing once independent downstream units to heel and attracting serious
equity investment. <BR>
<BR>
Yukos, whose core is the Siberian production centre of Nefteyugansk, has
been the most eager collaborator with new Russian financial institutions,
in particular Bank Menatep which took a majority stake in a loans-for-shares
auction with the company's blessing. Yukos' neighbour Surgutneftegaz is
the crusty, grudgingly respected conservative of the oil patch, running
a tight traditional ship and exercising extreme caution with outsiders,
foreign or domestic. Management arranged for its own pension fund to win
the loans-for-shares auction. <BR>
<BR>
The newest Siberian giant, Sidanco, is trying to live down a shady reputation
from its <BR>
ill-fated White Nights joint venture with America's Phibro. It has played
its cards in Moscow brilliantly, however, managing to expand from a single
drilling centre at Varyegan to full-fledged membership of the sisterhood.
<BR>
<BR>
The Nizhnevartovsk oil agglomeration is Siberia's sick man. Its gargantuan
Samotlor field, once the ultimate symbol of Soviet economic might, has become
a staggering example of crumbling infrastructure. Last comes Komineft, whose
interests include the resources of the Komi Autonomous Republic in European
Russia, and Gazprom. <BR>
<BR>
The fortunes of Gazprom, which single-handedly accounts for nearly 20% of
Russia's exports, have certainly been aided by the rise of former director
Viktor Chernomyrdin to the prime minister's chair. Indeed, foreign aid types
grumble about Gazprom's extraordinary record of tax exemptions. But the
premier's importance to the energy industry as a whole is often overstated.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="foreign-entry"></A>CASE FOR TREATMENT </H3>
The experience of Pfizer highlights some common, and not so common, challenges
facing foreign investors<BR>
<BR>
<I>by Craig Mellow </I><BR>
<BR>
Of the myriad statistics which course through a modern manager's mind, there
is one which gives Stuart Swanson the strength to get out of bed each morning.
Russia, where Swanson is country manager for US drug firm Pfizer International,
spent a mere $1.5 billion on wholesale pharmaceuticals in 1994. This is
the same amount as Poland, with a fourth of the population. It is not that
Russians are any healthier than Poles or, he believes, any poorer. Rather,
Russian doctors and hospitals are less informed about what is known in the
trade as pharma-economics. <BR>
<BR>
Swanson, an excited 30-something former US diplomat, reaches for nearby
scrap paper. &quot;Say the old drug costs $3.00 and my drug costs $15.00.
But with that drug you need two courses instead of one. And our drug gets
you back to work two days sooner. Or out of the hospital a day earlier.&quot;
In Russia, where patients commonly spend weeks in hospital for controllable
afflictions like high blood pressure, Swanson's logic seems compelling but
he sees little chance of a boom before 1997-98. <BR>
<BR>
It is clear now that few multinational companies will invest in Russia the
way they invested in China or Thailand, to produce cheap goods for re-export.
Russia's costs are not all that low any more, the distances between industrial
base and ports are vast and poorly navigated, quality is poor and the government
incorrigibly irritating. <BR>
<BR>
<B>More disposable income than predicted </B><BR>
<BR>
But Russia has proved unexpectedly attractive as a market to sell into.
Its 150 million people, plus as many again in the rest of the Commonwealth
of Independent States, consistently come up with more expendable income
than the statisticians predict. And the consumer landscape is a pre-modern
<I>terra incognita.</I> Multinationals bring products which are either new,
like videos and dishwashing liquid, or so superior in quality and packaging
that they form a new product category. <BR>
<BR>
Foreign drug firms walked into a void. Soviet economic planning alloted
production of most medicines to the central or east European satellites,
although bulk chemicals often came from plants in the Soviet Union. These
supply lines withered with the death of the Comecon trade bloc, leaving
Russia's pharmacies dependent on Indian medicines: cheap enough, but often
at least a generation out of date. <BR>
<BR>
Those foreign food, tobacco and detergent manufacturers who were wise enough
four years ago to disregard stories about a Russia in ruins have already
generated enough sales volume to justify local manufacturing. Mars and Proctor
&amp; Gamble, whose ads dominated the Russian airwaves a year back, now
feel confident enough to take a lower profile. <BR>
<BR>
Drug companies faced a more complicated task than their consumer goods colleagues.
The old ministerial procurement system, which Swanson says produced virtually
no sales for foreign firms, collapsed in 1992-93. Today the central government
makes less than 20% of Russia's drug purchases. The rest of the money is
spent by a patchwork of provincial health authorities, hospitals commanding
their own budgets and privatised pharmacies. <BR>
<BR>
Distribution was also revolutionised by private firms or joint-stock companies.
Taking the reins early in 1993, Swanson's first focus was getting Pfizer
products into these pipelines and the company's over-the-counter offerings
helped pave the way for much lower volume prescription drugs. Last year,
having created a supply line capable of delivering goods anywhere in Russia
within two days, Pfizer's attention shifted to the customer. Swanson hired
25 sales representatives in 15 cities to persuade doctors and administrators
of the efficiency of global profit leaders like Norvase (for cardiovascular
illnesses) and the anti-fungal Diflukan. <BR>
<BR>
There are signs of some progress. Pfizer's Moscow office has always paid
for itself out of sales which grew 120% last year to around $10 million:
not so much money relative to global revenues of $10 billion, but not so
bad while the company is establishing a presence. <BR>
<BR>
When dealing with the many layers of Russian bureaucracy, Swanson's guiding
principle is to &quot;avoid centres of incompetence&quot;. This was easier
said than done under the previous health minister Eduard Nechaev, replaced
in November: an army surgeon whose idea of protecting the public was to
issue every family with an infantryman's first aid kit. In such circumstances
Pfizer stuck to ground-level practitioners and local administrators wherever
possible. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Taking health in their own hands </B><BR>
<BR>
The new challenge is an official determination to protect the local pharmaceutical
industry, such as it is. The outgoing parliament passed a law last year
requiring punitive tariffs on all imported drugs whose &quot;equivalent&quot;
is made locally, quite a broad category if one chooses to define it that
way. Pfizer has nodded in the protectionists' direction by leasing manufacturing
time in a plant put up by Bristol-Myers Squibb. It is also building a small
facility of its own to produce veterinary drugs. But a dedicated factory
for human pharmaceuticals would require many times the current sales volume.
<BR>
<BR>
Swanson is sure time is on his side, not least because Russians are taking
health, like everything else, more into their own hands. Officially, medicine
remains a near-monopoly of the state but informally, &quot;people are already
even more accustomed to paying out of their own pocket than in a place like
Poland&quot;. Private insurance plans are slowly taking shape as well. <BR>
<BR>
Naturally, not everyone is so sure. Swanson has had trouble finding a replacement
for himself. &quot;In the food industry or banking, Moscow is already seen
as a post which can make your career,&quot; he explains. &quot;But our people
just haven't seen the numbers yet.&quot; <p>

<H2>TATARSTAN </H2>
<H4>An autonomous republic within Russia, Tatarstan has maintained its distance
from Moscow and initiated a series of economic reform programmes designed
to attract foreign investors. At the same time the country's first-ever
president, Mintimer Shaimiev, has kept a firm grip and steered Tatarstan
away from the upheavals that have beset other Russian republics like faraway
Chechnya <BR>

<H3><A NAME="overview"></A>AFTER THE SOFT LANDING </H3>
<B>By opting for a gentler economic reform programme, the Volga republic
has avoided many of Russia's problems <BR>
<BR>
</B><I>By Margie Lindsay </I><BR>
<BR>
Proud of its special place in the Russian federation, the republic of Tatarstan
has managed to placate strong nationalist sentiments and has negotiated
a treaty with Russia which gives it special status within the federation.
Through sustained and unrelenting tough negotiating led by the republic's
first president, Mintimer Shaimiev, and perhaps more effectively through
the withholding of tax revenue owed to Moscow, Tatarstan was able to insist
on concessions and succeeded in winning a large degree of autonomy for its
mainly Muslim population of just over 3 million. <BR>
<BR>
Most importantly, the agreement gives Tatarstan the right to sell half of
its considerable oil reserves at market prices. In addition the country's
authorities are allowed to collect tax and pay only a proportion to the
federal budget. <BR>
<BR>
However, grey areas remain and it is unclear just how far Tatarstan can
pursue an independent policy. Although the republic has said that it is
not seeking full independence, it already conducts a limited foreign policy.
It was the first republic to be granted the right to carry out its own foreign
economic policy and has trade missions in Washington, Paris, Adelaide, Moscow
and St Petersburg. More offices are planned with other trade partners. <BR>
<BR>
Despite the headway made by the republic on political issues, progress on
economic reform has been slower. Tatarstan's leadership opted for a third
way between state socialism and the free market shock therapy applied in
Russia. Instead President Shaimiev plumped for what was dubbed a soft-landing
reform which involved using hard currency reserves and revenues from oil
and oil-related industries to keep the economy stable. <BR>
<BR>
To ensure that living standards did not fall too fast or by too much, the
government kept price controls in place for some goods - although all prices
are free now - ensured social security payments were maintained and kept
state companies afloat when threatened by bankruptcy. As a result, local
people are relatively happy with the reforms so far. Shops in the capital
city Kazan are full of goods, albeit at higher prices than before. Food
is plentiful and affordable. <BR>
<BR>
The reform programme is also designed to further a long-term strategy which
will employ oil money to make Tatarstan an investment-driven economy. The
programme aims to attract foreign and domestic investors through incentives
and guarantees. <BR>
<BR>
<B>A sedate privatisation programme </B><BR>
<BR>
With one of the most progressive laws on private land ownership in Russia,
Tatarstan may indeed be attractive for investors. The state property committee
has created financial-industrial groups which provide large stakes in privatised
enterprises and issue secondary shares, bonds and credits backed by shares.
<BR>
<BR>
The sedate pace of privatisation in Tatarstan stemmed from the government's
desire to avoid major bankruptcies, with the accompanying social and economic
problems seen elsewhere in Russia. But it has led to abuses, particularly
by keeping in place old-style managements, the sort of people who most often
oppose interference from foreign investors. Restructuring is still needed
in the industrial sector where Soviet-era enterprises need new management
techniques and know-how to meet the challenges of a market economy. <BR>
<BR>
Political and economic stability have made the ethnically mixed population
grateful to Shaimiev. Outside concerns that his style of leadership is closer
to dictatorship than democracy tend to be brushed aside by the man on the
street as well as senior politicians. The president is genuinely liked and
admired for his ability to cushion the Volga republic from the worst of
the depression and keep nationalist sentiment under control - unlike in
Chechnya. <BR>
<BR>
The downside is that budget problems are looming. Tatarstan's economics
minister, Alla Gabutdinova, is cagey about the exact state of the republic's
finances. Inflation is well over 200% for the year, slightly below the figure
for all Russia. But information about oil production is contradictory, with
Gabutdinova saying it totals around 24 million tonnes a year while the foreign
trade ministry says it is a steady 25 million. Oil revenue last year was
approximately $900 million and should stay at that level for the foreseeable
future. <BR>
<BR>
Chemical and petrochemical industries once accounted for a quarter of the
republic's entire industrial output. Since then it has collapsed, as it
has throughout Russia. Gabutdinova wants to see higher oil production and
revenues from the sector but this seems unlikely, given the current state
of the oilfields, many of which are in need of repair and new technology
if they are to be developed further. The government estimates the sector
needs $1.2 billion to boost capacity, modernise and install new technologies.
<BR>
<BR>
Tatarstan holds around 10% of Russia's total oil reserves, but production
peaked in 1973 at 104 million tonnes. Like other republics with oil supplies,
Tatarstan is eagerly waiting for the federal parliament to pass a production-sharing
law which will clear the way for investment in its declining oilfields.
Foreign trade officials are praying three projects will be implemented if
the law is passed which would enable Tatarstan to boost its chemical and
petrochemical exports as well. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Tatneft depository receipts on offer </B><BR>
<BR>
Tatneft, the republic's integrated oil company, has now been privatised
and the company needs foreign investment. But western companies are hesitating
until the production-sharing law is passed before committing themselves.
Tatneft has already obtained preliminary approval by the US Securities and
Exchange Commission for the issue of depository receipts to help raise capital
for the company. If it goes ahead the offer, probably around 10% of shares,
will be handled by Citibank. <BR>
<BR>
Tatneft also has three joint ventures with western companies aimed at transferring
advanced technology and better environmental controls to Tatarstan's industry.
The largest investment is by Total: the two others are Global Natural Resources
of the US and Germany's Mineraloil. However, in 1994 these three joint ventures
only produced 3 million tonnes of crude oil. <BR>
<BR>
Apart from substantial amounts of oil the republic holds massive reserves
of oil shale - approximately 20 billion tonnes - but so far it has proved
impossible to extract this without causing substantial ecological damage,
as the oil shale reserves are at shallow depths, immediately under the water
table. <BR>
<BR>
Natural gas is extracted in Tatarstan, but in much smaller quantities than
oil. There are also opportunities to produce natural bitumen in the regions
beyond the Kama River, where deposits are estimated at 12.5 billion tonnes.
Other fuel resources include peat and coal. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Urbanised by heavy industry </B><BR>
<BR>
Tatarstan is heavily urbanised, with three-quarters of the population living
in built-up areas, largely because of industries like oil and petrochemicals.
It contains the largest petrochemical plant in all Europe, Nizhnekamskneftekhim,
which manufactures a range of products including propane, isoprene-monomer,
ethylene and propylene. <BR>
<BR>
It needs modernisation, however, and the company is planning to build another
plant able to refine 7 million tonnes of oil a year. When this begins operating,
Tatarstan will be able to supply a range of consumers beyond the republic's
borders. A new refinery in Almetyevsk went into production last year and
will refine around 400,000 tonnes a year of crude oil, producing petrol,
diesel and bitumen for the republic's eastern regions. <BR>
<BR>
In manufacturing, Tatarstan is the centre of Russian truck production. The
monopoly producer Kamaz builds some 80% of all of Russia's freight vehicles.
A plant in Naberezhnnye Chelny, on the Kama River, became Russia's first
joint stock company in 1990, with the republic holding 11% of shares. Despite
severe financial and structural problems, Kamaz is making progress. Recently
the company signed a joint venture deal under which the US firm General
Motors will manufacture Chevrolet Blazer jeeps at Kamaz's Yelabuga car factory.
Around 50,000 cars are to be built in an investment worth around $300 million.
The Yelabuga plant is only half-built, an economic casualty of the ending
of state subsidies. The 50% joint venture, led by GM, has the blessing of
the Tatarstan government as well as Russian officials. Initially the Yelabuga
plant will assemble US-made parts but the plan is to move gradually towards
using more Russian components. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Kamaz open for more partners </B><BR>
<BR>
Before the GM deal, Kamaz formed a partnership with Cummins Engine Company
of the US and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. A new engine
was to be developed and built by Kamaz for an investment of between $330-500
million but the project appears to have halted, partly because of a serious
fire in 1994 which knocked its expansion plans for some time. The firm also
says it is working with Rockwell International. Despite the fire Kamaz remains
determined to attract more foreign investors for component supply, product
assembly, technology transfer and axle manufacture. <BR>
<BR>
A related area which should offer entry opportunities is Tatarstan's defence
industry, now being converted to civilian production but still an important
sector along with aviation, space and shipbuilding. During World War II,
Soviet military production was moved from Moscow to Tatarstan to put it
beyond German reach. This legacy means there is still a high concentration
of defence-related industries in the republic, including research and design
bureaux. <BR>
<BR>
Many former defence establishments boast cutting-edge technology, including
the Kazan helicopter factory which recently unveiled its new light helicopter
at the Le Bourget airshow in France. The company plans to manufacture the
first prototype early next year of the helicopter, known as the Ansat, which
will be fitted with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines from its St Petersburg joint
venture. <BR>
<BR>
Tatarstan's defence conversion has opened up new areas of the economy. Two
agreements between Moscow and Tatarstan (signed in June 1993 and March 1994)
regulate relations in this sector but the absence of a coherent conversion
programme means that most enterprises are responsible for ensuring their
own futures. All military industrial enterprises belong to the government,
which should simplify negotiations with potential investors. <BR>
<BR>
The transport sector also offers openings. Kazan is the largest port on
the Volga River and has been a trade and transport centre between the Middle
East, European Russia and Scandinavia for centuries. Under the EU's Tacis
programme, a major infrastructure project to modernise the Volga port is
getting under way. <BR>
<BR>
An international terminal will operate as a free economic zone, providing
warehouse facilities plus the consignment and distribution of commodities.
Meanwhile the Gorky Shipyard in Zelenodolsk, which recently celebrated its
centenary, plans to expand and modernise production by manufacturing a new
high-speed hydroplane vessel. <BR>
<BR>
A major problem throughout the former Soviet Union is poor communications.
Tatarstan has begun to address this problem with a modern telephone system.
Kazan opened the first digital hybrid wireless system in Russia in July
when two major digital long-distance telephone exchanges also became operational.
The $60 million project by Hughes Network Systems and Alcatel-SEL raised
the number of telephones in the republic to 210,000. To help pay for the
better services on offer Tatarstan's telecommunications ministry, in conjunction
with the Kazan City Telephone Network company, recently issued 16,000 telephone
loan bonds which were sold to private individuals and included an entitlement
to quick connection to the telephone network. <BR>
<BR>
Apart from modernising its communications infrastructure, Tatarstan is also
improving air services. In November, British Aerospace Consultancy Services
signed a preliminary agreement to manage the upgrading of Kazan airport.
A new 3.7km runway complying with international standards is expected to
be operation by March and more direct international services are planned
for next year. <BR>
<BR>
Tatarstan's agricultural sector plays an important economic role. The area
of land available for agricultural use totals 4.4 million hectares, of which
3.6 million are arable land. Like most other areas in Russia, the republic
needs substantial investment in its food processing industry, along with
wholesale and retail sectors of agriculture. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Guarantees from the government </B><BR>
<BR>
Foreign investors are likely to find Tatarstan welcoming. A special presidential
decree has created a profit tax holiday ranging from between three and five
years and a three-year property tax holiday. The investment laws are relatively
liberal and are more inviting on several points than those on offer in the
Russian Federation. The government is willing to provide investors with
guarantees of property rights: the necessary legal framework has already
been put in place and guarantees are provided against changes in the law
or the termination of investment activity. <BR>
<BR>
One way the local government intends to promote investment is through its
ban on operations by Moscow banks. While Tatarstan banks are still at the
beginning of the learning curve, their distance from the more corrupt and
violent atmosphere in Moscow may make them more attractive joint venture
partners for western bankers. <BR>
<BR>
This could provide a new element to an already growing trend among foreign
investors to look beyond the Moscow-St Petersburg area for opportunities.
The coming years should see a shift in emphasis from the two main cities
to Russia's regions. Tatarstan could then offer investors a toe-hold in
the federation. The decision of GM to go ahead with its Kamaz deal should
help encourage others to follow its lead and come to Tatarstan. As a GM
executive remarks: &quot;Tatarstan is one of the best places in Russia to
do business. It has the critical elements: political stability, trained
personnel and a leadership committed to providing incentives and guarantees
for foreign investment.&quot;

<H3><A NAME="kazan-pizza"></A>PIZZERIA VERDI </H3>
<B>The story of how Tatarstan's first pizzeria opened in Kazan has all of
the makings of an Italian opera</B> <BR>
<BR>
Walking down the otherwise sombre streets of Kazan, an elegant but cheerful
pizzeria strikes an incongruous note. Known as Giuseppe's, it is owned by
Giuseppe Sparta, an Italian from Sicily who came to Tatarstan three years
ago. <BR>
<BR>
The story of how Sparta ended up in Tatarstan has all the makings of an
Italian opera. He first entered eastern Europe 28 years ago. Together with
a friend he saw the opportunities in Slovenia and quickly opened his first
pizzeria in Ljubljana. Moving eastward, Sparta next went to Budapest where
he became, as he modestly puts it, &quot;the king of pizzas&quot; in Hungary's
capital. From that small beginning he has built up a franchise operation
for his pizzerias as well as a profitable business supplying restaurant
and food processing equipment throughout east-central Europe and the Russian
Federation. <BR>
<BR>
A state visit to Budapest in 1992 of the Tatarstan government convinced
him that a visit to Kazan was needed. &quot;I liked the youth in Kazan.
I thought they would be successful,&quot; says Sparta, offering one reason
for staying. His other reasons were less idealistic. Seeing that Moscow
and St Petersburg were over-crowded with foreign restaurants, Sparta saw
his future in the less known regions. Kazan, he believed, was as good a
place as any to start. <BR>
<BR>
As the only foreign-owned restaurant in the capital - a 50:50 joint venture
owned by Sparta and the Kazan city government - the restaurant owner's contact
with both the expatriate community and government officials is wide. Such
contacts help smooth business problems, as well as keeping Sparta informed
of local gossip. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Everyone comes to Giuseppe's,&quot; says Sparta. This also includes
locals and students who are encouraged to use the pizzeria as a meeting
place and somewhere they can buy ice creams, cakes or coffees. <BR>
<BR>
But Sparta's beginnings in Kazan were not trouble-free. &quot;You have difficulties
everywhere. Repairs here were particularly troublesome as there were no
tools to do them with and no shops to buy things from,&quot; he says. The
pizzeria's Italian-style furnishings had to be imported, as did most of
the kitchen equipment. Extensive rewiring of the building was needed to
meet the owner's safety standards. While he still imports equipment and
a few provisions, most of the food used is local and he says he has few
problems with delivery or quality. <BR>
<BR>
The restaurant's success has led Sparta to open a further two branches of
Giuseppe's pizzerias in Kazan. Although he says he is just beginning to
make a profit he intends to stay, not least because he is now married to
a local woman: another big advantage to Tatarstan, he says. <BR>
<BR>
His advice to businessmen looking to invest in Tatarstan is simple: &quot;Find
the correct partner. Be very cautious to chose the best one. You need to
connect with government bodies and work together if you want to build a
factory. To produce here you need to come with specialists and live here.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Sparta is particularly keen on Tatarstan's youth as a potential workforce
for foreign projects. &quot;Young people here are very educated and talented.
If you bring new technology they will understand it quickly.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He recognises that problems still remain, not just in the country but in
the Tatarstan region as well. &quot;You need to live here. You need to give
an example of how to act. One problem here is that when people make money
they buy the most expensive car they can to show off their wealth, rather
than reinvesting it. They often don't understand that even if you are the
owner, you must work hard and get your hands dirty.&quot; <BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>

<H3><A NAME="mintimer-shaimiev"></A>INDEPENDANT REFORM</H3>
<B>His skill in handling change and avoiding ethnic conflict has made President
Mintimer Shaimiev popular <BR>
<BR>
</B><I>By Margie Lindsay </I><BR>
<BR>
To many Mintimer Shaimiev, the president of Tatarstan, is a dictator. To
his people, however, he is the man who has kept civil war at bay and helped
steer them through the economic transition. <BR>
<BR>
Shaimiev presents himself as a loving grandfather but beneath the charm
and smiles lies a hardened career politician. He has steered a difficult
and dangerous course over the years since his election. When the Soviet
Union broke up in 1992, Tatar nationalists cried out for full independence.
Shaimiev negotiated hard with Russia and won the status of autonomous republic
for his country. The result was that he won a considerable amount of sovereignty
while keeping the republic firmly rooted within the Russian Federation.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Skills as negotiator </B><BR>
<BR>
At the same time, Shaimiev recognised that most nationalist sentiment was
fuelled by economic frustrations and easing such problems became a priority.
Following this approach, termed the &quot;soft landing&quot;, the president
maintained social protection and kept price controls on certain basic foods
to avoid shortages and soaring prices. These measures, coupled with his
political skill in calming the Tatar nationalists, has gained him widespread
popularity. <BR>
<BR>
More recently he has turned his negotiation skills beyond the republic,
acting as a would-be mediator between the warring parties in Chechnya and
Russia. A year ago he was considered one of the most influential figures
in Russia, yet he appears to have no ambitions outside his republic. Indeed,
Shaimiev is coy about whether he intends to stand for another term in this
year's Tatarstan presidential elections. He says he will give his answer
when the time is right. <BR>
<BR>
In the meantime the president is concentrating on those domestic difficulties
that remain. &quot;The policies we aimed at have strengthened the statehood
of Tatarstan. We now must deepen our economic reform and shorten our transition
period to the market,&quot; he says. &quot;Our main task is to stop the
fall in living standards. We have to achieve economic stability and increase
the volume of industrial production. We saw real growth in the second half
of last year. Now we have that growth we must preserve it in 1996.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Foreign trade relations are a high priority for the president. &quot;We
must strengthen relations with Russia and other countries. Over the past
year we have established relations with many countries: our main task is
to develop trade with them and create conditions for foreign investors.
We now plan to implement some investment projects with US and German companies
in particular, but the main thing is to create a favourable [overall] climate
for foreign investors,&quot; says Shaimiev. <BR>
<BR>
Tatarstan has already enacted measures which make investment in the republic
more attractive than many other places in Russia. Shaimiev explains: &quot;All
the natural resources on our territory belong to us and during the privatisation
process the majority of government shares in these will be used as guarantees
for investors. We are preparing about 100 projects where we will seek foreign
participation. We are giving foreign investors more and better information
than they can find elsewhere in Russia.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Clarifying rights on land ownership </B><BR>
<BR>
He outlines the opportunities which the republic already offers: &quot;We
have made the rights on land ownership clear - foreign investors can buy
and sell land. We have published and adopted laws on investment which give
tax holidays. Through privatisation shares in some attractive industries,
like petrochemicals, will be offered.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, the president thinks the republic could do more to win the
much-needed capital, technology and know-how essential if Tatarstan wants
to build up its industrial base and help convert a largely defence-oriented
industry to civilian production. &quot;How do we improve the climate for
foreign investors? Well, for a start we can offer state guarantees for investors.
We have finished setting up a large investment company with the help of
foreign partners and for the first time we are beginning to organise insurance
policies for large enterprises. Of course our economic situation will also
help attract new investment.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
What the president would like investors to see as Tatarstan's trump card
is its political stability. Within a turbulent Russia, Tatarstan stands
out as the most politically and economically stable republic. &quot;The
first reason foreign investors should look here is because of our stability.
We have great national resources, especially oil, as well as other developed
industries such as chemicals, machine-building and those with high-technology
potential.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Although some people in Tatarstan still hanker after full independence,
Shaimiev is realistic about the future of his country. There are also worries
that the outcome of recent Russian parliamentary elections, in which the
once ruling communists became the single biggest party, and forthcoming
presidential elections may have a negative impact on Tatarstan. <BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, President Shaimiev sounds confident. &quot;We want to help
the population to chose correctly, to make the right political priorities.
In our last elections the communists did not win a majority of the votes
and this trend will continue,&quot; he said, referring to a local parliamentary
poll. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Of course the communists use difficulties in the economy, particularly
with the elderly, to gain support. But the majority of the population is
moderate,&quot; he adds, citing broad support in Tatarstan for Our Home
is Russia, the party of Victor Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister at
the time of going to press. &quot;It seems natural for us to continue our
course of political reform. Our voters need to support us and I hope they
will,&quot; he concludes.*<BR><BR> <HR WIDTH=60%>

<H3><A NAME="privatisation"></A>FROM STABLE TO STABLE </H3>
<B>The former state-owned company Melita is learning the sometimes harsh
lessons of the free market </B><BR>
<BR>
&quot;In Russia fur clothing is not about prestige. We need it for our climate
- for military and civilian use,&quot; says Alexei Pakhomov, president of
Melita, one of Kazan's leading companies specialising in the processing
of skins. It handles nearly 5 million raw skins a year and manufactures
ready-made garments from different kinds of fur. <BR>
<BR>
The company - now privately owned by employees and management - is typical
of Kazan's former state industries. Since privatisation was completed in
1992, Melita has been free from state interference. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Without privatisation we would still be tied to the state,&quot; explains
Pakhomov. &quot;We have maintained our contacts and work closely with our
suppliers. Today our company processes one-third of Russia's fur production.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Leading a company in Russia is not easy, even in a republic as stable as
Tatarstan, confesses Melita's head. &quot;The situation changes constantly.
It is particularly difficult to finance expansion.&quot; Predictably enough,
the company has had to fend off protests from animal rights protesters.
&quot;We have had some disturbances, some difficulties in selling, but over
the last three years we have increased our sales volume,&quot; says Pakhomov.
<BR>
<BR>
Trusting more in his company's ability to finance expansion than in the
banks which charge high interest rates, Pakhomov has been investing in new
technology to help improve his firm's performance. &quot;We use chemistry
and modern technology from leading German, Swiss and Italian firms such
as Henkel, BASF, Stockhausen and Sandoz. Our professional skill is based
on more than 5,000 specialists working in 10 factories belonging to our
company. We try to pay particular attention to every detail and keep quality
high,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
Melita co-operates closely with Russian buyers as well as those from Germany,
Switzerland, Italy, Spain and the US. Although none of Melita's furs are
actually exported, many of the company's products are bought in duty-free
shops in Russia. &quot;Everyone is eager to buy furs in Russia. People come
from all over the world to buy them. Our main task now is to make higher
quality furs. If you have good quality raw materials, then you can make
good quality clothing,&quot; says Pakhomov. <BR>
<BR>
He acknowledges that the right employee attitudes are essential to achieving
this. &quot;Through privatisation, people became more concerned with the
firm's future. We understand that high quality is what sells, so we have
implemented programmes to introduce more know-how and new equipment,&quot;
he says. <BR>
<BR>
Melita has reorganised production and begun to specialise. &quot;We trained
people abroad, in Italy for example, because we knew our technology was
bad and we wanted to improve it. We fired staff we no longer needed and
enlarged production. We have created a commercial and marketing section
which studies the markets and, unlike before, we take design into account,&quot;
concludes Pakhomov. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are looking for investors from abroad. We have even looked at projects
with the EBRD. We need around $10 million, but we do not want participation
in our equity,&quot; says Pakhomov, speaking for many of Tatarstan's managers.
&quot;The most important thing for us is money.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Pakhomov sees several reasons why foreign investors should chose Tatarstan.
&quot;Our economy is more stable here than elsewhere in Russia. We are isolated
from Russia in many ways. Investors should look at Tatarstan because of
its stable enterprises and because the level of our profits is high.&quot;<p>

<H2>TYUMEN </H2 >
<H4>This vast region in western Siberia is blessed with equally vast oil
and gas reserves but must still resolve how to share the spoils, both within
its own territory and with the central government in Moscow. Meanwhile,
steps are being taken to make it easier for foreigners to enter the Russian
energy sector and give it the vital injection it needs of money and technology

<H3><A NAME="overview"></A>SQUARING AN ARCTIC CIRCLE </H3>
<B>Tyumen's energy riches have brought economic success but also regional
disputes about division of the spoils</B> <BR>
<BR>
Tyumen, which stretches from the Arctic Circle in the north to the border
of Kazakhstan in the south, is one of Russia's most prosperous regions.
Average wages are two to three times higher than elsewhere. Shops are well
supplied and people on the streets of its capital, also called Tyumen, sport
expensive fur coats during the long, cold winter. The Siberian city has
always been a prosperous trading centre, as well as a place of internal
exile for troublesome Russians. <BR>
<BR>
But Tyumen is not as affluent as it would like to be. The region has substantial
oil and gas reserves and provides over half of federal budget revenues from
oil and gas. Yet very little money finds its way from Moscow back to the
area. Although its resources give Tyumen economic power, it lacks the political
muscle to argue for the concessions that other resource-rich regions such
as Tatarstan and Baskhortostan have negotiated for themselves. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Under the Kremlin's thumb </B><BR>
<BR>
This is because Moscow has adopted a divide-and-rule policy to keep the
potentially rebellious Tyumen region firmly under its thumb. The central
Russian government has created two autonomous national homelands or <I>okrugs</I>,
ostensibly to protect national minorities living locally although they make
up only a small part of the population. Yamal-Nenets comprises half the
land area of the region and holds most of Russia's gasfields but has a population
of only 500,000. Khanti-Mansi covers a third of land area and has a population
of 1.3 million but holds almost all of Tyumen's oil reserves. <BR>
<BR>
In the south is the region's capital and the smallest of the three districts,
accounting for only one-sixth of the region's land area but with a relatively
large population of 1.3 million. It is a relatively poor area of industry
and agriculture, with little of the oil and gas riches found in the two
northern districts.<I> </I>The capital is the centre of the region's political,
transport and communications structure but its ability to administer the
region and control the two autonomous homelands is constantly challenged.
More often than not its wishes are ignored by the <I>okrugs,</I> which are
loath to allow Tyumen's government to get its hands on what they see as
their wealth. While the Tyumen region as a whole is not agitating for independence,
Moscow appears happy to let the infighting continue. <BR>
<BR>
It is surprising that Tyumen is not better served by the federation, given
that the present minister of fuel was previously governor of the region
and that Russia's prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin hails from Tyumen.
But politics in Russia are never simple. <BR>
<BR>
Ownership of natural resources is a sore subject. There is no transparency
in laws, the rules change constantly and there are serious contradictions
between regional and federal institutions. Currency tax regulations make
it difficult for the oil companies to make money at all. Tyumen's regional
authorities, led by its governor Leonid Roketsky, have tried to increase
taxes. But meanwhile the two autonomous national regions have made rival
claims, usually from the only real revenue source - oil and gas sales. Such
endless squabbles over tax have deterred foreign investors and as a resull
most of Russia's major oil companies are close to bankruptcy. <BR>
<BR>
One foreign investor which has ventured into the region, Total of France,
has pledged to put $1 billion into exploration of the Kharyaga oilfield
in Nenets district. British Gas has also signed a protocol with Gazprom,
Russia's gas company, to explore business opportunities. But both projects
are on hold, waiting for clarity on the tax situation and progress on a
federal oil and gas production-sharing law awaiting presidential approval,
which would allow foreigners to exploit and sell Russian ener for the first
time. <BR>
<BR>
There is unlikely to be progress on either, however, while Russia is in
the throes of political change ahead of a presidential ballot in the middle
of this year and and as the communist party resumes prime position in the
political arena. That means Tyumen and western investors will have to wait.
<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, Tyumen's wealth is worth fighting over. It still produces
a lot of oil, even though output has declined sharply from a peak in 1987.
One of the largest producers is Nizhnevartovskneftegaz, now part of the
newly formed Tyumen Oil Company. It has had to scale down its operations
and lay off staff in order to reduce an Rb750 billion (US$161 million) debt
to the federal budget. Drilling operations have been cut, contracts stopped
and the working week reduced to three days. Last year, in October and November
alone energy production there dropped by 17%, a fall which will cost the
federal budget an estimated Rb60 billion. <BR>
<BR>
<B>A declining output of oil </B><BR>
<BR>
The fall-off in oil production is due to a combination of factors. As prices
were deregulated throughout Russia, oil continued to be priced by the state
but the costs of recovery have grown. The oil industry is owed over Rb500
billion by former Soviet republics which continue to receive oil but are
unable to pay for it. State quotas are still set and deprive enterprises
of essential supplies of oil at free prices. There are considerable tax
disincentives to both the export of oil and sales internally at free prices.
<BR>
<BR>
Tyumen badly needs foreign investment in its oil and gas production. A Russian-American
Oil and Gas Technology Centre has been set up in Tyumen by the US government,
the regional authorities and the Russian oil and gas ministry. It is helping
to bring Russian and western companies together to discuss the problems
faced by the region's oil and gasfields. Environmental damage is high on
the list. &quot;When drilling in Europe we are obliged to build a pit and
put down cement, plastic or whatever to contain spills. If there is any
blow-out of accident, the leakage is contained. In western Siberia, you
put the rig down and that's it,&quot; says one western oilman in Tyumen.
But that is changing, as Tyumen's younger generation becomes more ecologically
aware. The World Bank and Russia have agreed a $500 million loan for the
rehabilitation of the oil industry in western Siberia. A credit of $174
million has also been agreed with European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
to restore 300 idle oil wells belonging to Purneftgas. <BR>
<BR>
In the gas sector, there are similar problems. At the moment, 93% of Russia's
gas comes from Tyumen, mainly from Yamal-Nenets and from the Urengoi, Medvezh
and Yamburg gasfields. Unlike oil, gas production has remained relatively
stable but it is now in decline. The state gas company Gazprom can only
realistically maintain and increase production by developing new fields,
also dependent upon the production-sharing law being passed. <BR>
<BR>
There are three major offshore gas projects, which are difficult to exploit.
One of these is the Yamal project on the Arctic coast, run by Gasprom, which
is due to start production in 1997 providing it can buy the high-technology
equipment required. New export pipelines need to be built too, offering
substantial opportunities for foreign businesses as do the World Bank's
new gas processing plants in Tyumen. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The Finnish connection </B><BR>
<BR>
Once oil and gas production takes off the Finnish construction company YIT
is hoping to go ahead with its long-awaited plans to work in the Tyumen
region. &quot;We started here under the Tsar, then we worked with the Soviets
and now we work again with the Russians. In the long run I can see a lot
of potential in this region. That's why our company is here. We didn't come
for quick money,&quot; says Ilkka Sinkkonen, head of YIT in Tyumen. The
Finnish company's experience in western Siberia is extensive. It has been
involved in the Yamburg Arctic gasfield, building a town for 9,000 people
including residential and service buildings, as well as earthworks for the
Ardalin oilfield development in the Timan Pechora area. <BR>
<BR>
Unusually for a non-Russian construction company, YIT uses local labour.
&quot;We use Russians, unlike the Turks or Yugoslavs who bring their workers
in. Sometimes even the Russians don't understand this. But we can assure
them it is possible to use Russian workers and have a good result. It is
only a question of management. Russians really are willing to learn and
want to do quality work. We find them very good,&quot; says Sinkkonen. <BR>
<BR>
The Tyumen regional government is also hoping to attract foreign investors
to boost timber production and processing. The industry is beset by a high
level of wastage, environmental damage and inefficiency. Tyumen has considerable
forests, covering about two thirds of its territory. Exploitable reserves
are put at 330,00sq km and contain 2.6 billion cubic metres of timber, 54%
of which are softwoods. Half of the production is exported in log form and
the rest is processed locally. But in the first quarter of this year the
output of commercial timber fell 27% compared with the same period in 1994.
<BR>
<BR>
Nearly all the region's agricultural production is based in the south, below
Tobolsk. Tyumen provides for half its own food needs but again, large-scale
pollution is a problem, particularly in the fishing industry. The privatisation
of farming itself is confused and overly bureaucratic. Food processing badly
needs modernisation as well as better management. There is also a range
of mechanical engineering and electrical equipment enterprises, mainly located
around Tyumen city. Most are also in need of modernisation. <BR>
<BR>
Despite the wealth of natural resources available, little processing is
done in the region. The challenge to the government is to provide a refinery
and petrochemical base to make the most of its resources. The Tobolsk Petrochemical
Plant at present produces a range of consumer goods such as bleacher Belizna,
medical preparations, footwear, PVCs and other products and has ambitious
plans for expansion. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Leave something for tomorrow </B><BR>
<BR>
Tobolsk president Vladimir Judin says the company has entered into over
10 joint ventures with western partners. Output is to go only to the Russian
market so, Judin adds with a smile, western producers can rest easy that
Tobolsk will be no competition. &quot;We only want to develop the processing
of crude oil and allow us to produce more wealth and fill in the local market.
Our doors remain open to all [foreign investment] offers,&quot; he adds.
<BR>
<BR>
However, Judin would like to see more government understanding for businessmen:
&quot;The first thing the Russian government should understand is that if
it squeezes businesses, companies will not make profits. It should think
how to provide as much incentive as possible to foreign investors so the
results will be bigger revenue flows later. Today's wish to eat everything
leaves nothing for tomorrow.&quot;<BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>
<H4></H4>
<H3><A NAME="investor-stories"></A>A FROSTY WELCOME </H3>
<B>The region's attempts to attract investment have been limited and have
met only mixed success <BR>
</B><BR>
&quot;Realistically Russia and Tyumen offer foreign businesses the biggest
opportunities in the world - maybe even greater than China. In the long
run firms with the cash flow to be able to justify a long-term presence
will ultimately succeed, but this is not a market for small companies coming
for the short term, especially if they are looking to invest,&quot; says
Joe Barraclough, a representative of the Alberta government in Canada and
resident in Tyumen for three years. <BR>
<BR>
He sees great potential in the area and stresses the many changes seen over
the past three years. But he says that while western businessmen have influenced
Russia, only the country itself can make its own choices. &quot;Russia is
deciding whether it continues the reform process and joins the international
community or if it wants isolation. My feeling is that Russians want to
live well. In the last five years Russian people have travelled to western
Europe, north America. They know what's out there. They don't want to go
back.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
For the time being, oil and gas dominate the investment scene. However,
future success will partly depend on Tyumen's ability to attract foreign
interest in other industries earmarked for development. <BR>
<BR>
Western investors coming to Tyumen region face several challenges, least
of all the weather. &quot;Be patient. It's not so easy here. Usually time
is needed to organise good business relations and that takes at least two
years. It means you can't just visit once a year - that's not enough. You
need to find a local organisation or technician and establish links with
an enterprise and follow through,&quot; advises Tom Haselton, executive
director of the Russian-American Oil and Gas Technology Centre in Tyumen.
The centre is helping to bring Russian and western companies together and
promote the sale of Russian technologies. <BR>
<BR>
Haselton sees oil and gas development as the economic engine for the region's
future. &quot;I've noticed changes, but they are very slow. The main problem
is oil and gas companies face is money. They have the experience, but they
don't have the equipment. They can sell only a small percentage of their
output themselves and the revenues they get are not enough. The government's
taxation is high and its pricing policy is not realistic.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, little has so far been done to attract investment in the oil and
gas sectors. In addition to the problems of an uncertain legal and tax environment,
some see the attitudes of local companies as a problem. &quot;They think
they don't need any help, but they do,&quot; says one western businessman
referring to Russia's oil companies. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In their minds they believe the only problem is money and they think
they can do everything to stop the arrival of western companies in Siberia.
But the western companies have arrived and they are being asked for money.
But as long as the [oil and gas] production-sharing law is not passed, nothing
can happen,&quot; he concludes. <BR>
<BR>
Many of the oil and gasfields in Tyumen are old and need specific techniques
which are both sophisticated and costly. The industry faces other problems,
like pipeline corrosion caused by excessive water content in the oil going
through the lines. <BR>
<BR>
Most would-be investors are hopeful that big money will come into the region
to help develop Tyumen's substantial reserves. When that happens, service
industries as well as manufacturing should begin to develop in the region.

<H3><A NAME="governor-roketsky"></A>OIL AND TROUBLE WATERS</H3>
<B>The governor must walk a tightrope, balancing the often conflicting demands
of his own region with Moscow <BR>
<BR>
</B><I>by Margie Lindsay </I><BR>
<BR>
Leonid Roketsky, the governor of Tyumen region, has a lot to contend with.
Politically, he has to balance power between his two internal autonomous
regions, as well as between the republic and the federal government in Moscow.
On the economic side he needs to steer a middle path through the transformation
process without causing too severe a decline in living standards. <BR>
<BR>
Everyone is eager to get their hands on Tyumen's oil and gas revenues. But
until power relations become clearer, Tyumen like many other Russian republics
faces an uncertain future. Meanwhile Roketsky walks a tightrope. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The laws we have today are not enough. We are drafting, changing and
developing the particulars of power-sharing. The local system is also under
reform. When thisis carried out, it will influence relations between the
region and the federal government and local relations, too,&quot; he says
in an interview. Democratic progress, however, is slow: &quot;We have some
of the structures, but we need to implement them.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Despite the questionmark over relations with the federal authorities, Roketsky
is sure of Tyumen's place within the federation. &quot;I will obey the Russian
constitution and make sure the population obeys federal laws. At the same
time I am satisfied that we can solve our problems by ourselves without
interference from federal bodies.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>One step forward, two steps back </B><BR>
<BR>
A major problem is distribution of taxes, admits Roketsky. &quot;Whenever
we go one step forward, another problem arises. Although the Tyumen region
is in the Russian federation and by law all regions and republics are equal,
some are more equal than others. This is an internal power struggle that
we must sort out ourselves.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The region's two autonomous districts in the north, Yamal-Nenets and Khanti-Mansi,
believe they deserve to keep the oil and gas found in their territory which
already makes them very rich. &quot;We're witnessing the same processes
in the Tyumen region as we see in Russia. The same issues confront us: fiscal
problems and federalism,&quot; Roketsky explains. Federalism can only go
so far, he insists. &quot;Tyumen is the capital of the region and ultimately
this is where the power is focused.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
At the same time he is aware that Tyumen's economic dependence on oil and
gas is dangerous and wants to use these resources to restructure the region's
industrial base. Pointing to a thick three-volume report, Roketsky describes
his plans to change the industrial profile of Tyumen region over the next
several years. &quot;Our main goal is to expand oil and gas processing first.
We want to develop the further use of petrochemicals for the production
of plastics, polymers for cars and consumer goods. For this we have a good
industrial base.&quot; He points in particular to a development at Tobolst,
where a refinery complex and petrochemical facilities are being constructed
and expanded. The project has seen considerable success in attracting investment
from the west. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Expanding into cellulose </B><BR>
<BR>
There are also plans to expand in other major industrial areas. &quot;Our
second major goal is to produce cellulose. We also are looking at developing
other industries, such as manufacturing of oil and gas equipment and machines,
aircraft engines, car batteries and medical instruments as well as pharmaceuticals.
In light industry we are developing woollen and ready-made clothes production.
As for food processing, we need new technology and investments.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He says with pride that the region is already showing some signs of industrial
improvement. In the first 10 months of 1995 there was an 18% increase in
overall industrial output compared with the same 1994 period. This was achieved
even with a 3% drop in oil and gas production. <BR>
<BR>
Roketsky naturally places importance in the oil sector but is also keen
to diversify. &quot;Oil and gas will definately dominate our industry over
the next five years, but our desire is to stabilise that sector. Over the
next 10 years we expect oil output to be around 200 million tonnes a year
with gas production at around 550 billion cubic metres. At the same time
overall industrial production is likely to increase between 1.5% and 2%
a year over the next five years.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The governor wants to continue reforms in the agricultural sector as well
in the local administration. Roads and other aspects of infrastructure in
the region need improvement, as do health care and medical treatment. Telecommunications
is another area where a substantial amount of money will be spent over the
next five years. <BR>
<BR>
Foreign investors are expected to play a crucial role in helping the region
develop in the future: &quot;Considering the wealth in our region in natural
resources, we will be able to attract foreign investment. We want foreign
companies to come in to work with us, not just to sell us things. I think
we need to consider a better investment strategy for the region. We are
close to several markets outside Russia and investors could sell to those

<B>Concerns and hesitation </B><BR>
<BR>
But Roketsky has some sympathy for the reluctance of investors to come <BR>
forward, particularly after the unsettling outcome of recent parliamentary
elections and before the presidential ballot due in June: &quot;I understand
that the political stability of Russia is a concern for foreign investors.
But together we can build hotels, reconstruct airports and hospitals. By
their presence here foreign investors will ensure that the region's small
and medium-sized businesses develop.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He stresses that he does not believe changes at the federal level will make
a difference to the region. &quot;I think any power will smell the oil and
the Tyumen region will always attract the attention of politicians, he concludes.
&quot;At the same time there is no way back. It is my opinion that the formation
of policy is being made by the president and the federal government whatever
parliament is elected, power will be balanced by the president. I rely on
the wisdom of my countrymen to elect the right people.&quot;<BR><BR><HR WIDTH=60%>

<H3><A NAME="food-industry"></A>MUSTARD TO CHOCOLATE </H3>
<B>One food processing firm has progressed from poor Soviet-style standards
to market success </B><BR>
<BR>
Vasiliy Kiselyov, general director of Malvinka food processing company,
is one of a new breed of Russian managers and heads one of the more progressive
plants in Tyumen. <BR>
<BR>
The plant used to produce low-quality alcoholic drinks under the epitome
of Soviet-style management: poor-quality products, sloppy working practices
and unsafe premises. <BR>
<BR>
Now staff at Malvinka, which produces a range of products from mustard to
chocolates, work in clean, well-kept premises. Courtyards that were previously
knee-deep in mud have been tarmacked. New wine-making facilities are spotless
and the newest addition to the plant, a mini-bakery, is a model of efficiency.
<BR>
<BR>
Kiselyov is understandably proud of his company, whose name spells out the
various products it makes. Before a joint employee and management buyout
of the plant three years ago, Malvinka's reputation was at rock bottom.
But under Kiselyov's leadership the product range has been broadened and
the staff increased from about 78 workers three years ago to 400. <BR>
<BR>
How did the change happen? &quot;Such growth is mainly due to the development
of new production lines and capacity. Over the three years we've introduced
mayonnaise and mustard, for example. We've started research and development
and organised a marketing department. Production over the last three years
has expanded,&quot; he explains. <BR>
<BR>
Kiselyov has spent his entire working life connected with the food processing
industry. &quot;I am personally devoted to food production industry. I graduated
from the food technology institute in central Russia and the greater part
of my life I have worked in the north of the Tyumen region,&quot; he explains.
<BR>
<BR>
Kiselyov has spent around $7 million introducing new technology, all of
which came from outside Russia, to improve efficiency and expand the product
range. Next he plans to buy equipment for soft drink manufacturing worth
around $2 million and install a second production line for cooking oil at
a cost of $1.8 million. A total of $10 million is planned to be invested
over the next three years. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In future we plan to develop our capacity and introduce new products.
Two years from now I expect around 1,500 people to be employed here. We
plan to build a flour mill, to produce food oil and margarine from rapeseed
grown by local farmers. We want to add shampoo and soaps to our line,&quot;
he enthuses. <BR>
<BR>
Kiselyov is proud, too, that the company uses natural ingredients as far
as possible in production. For example, local strawberries, blackcurrants
and cloudberries are all used to produce a range of soft and alcoholic drinks.
<BR>
<BR>
So far all the expansion has been financed from working capital and profits:
bank loans, explains the company's general director, are too expensive.
Although he prefers to use his own resources, Kiselyov does not rule out
the possibility of linking with a foreign partner. &quot;We are positive
about foreign investors. We need a western company to help us, particularly
in the production of sweets, chocolates and confectionery. We cover the
needs of the Tyumen region for many products but we still have potential.
Yes, we are looking for a partner, but it is a <BR>
two-way process.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Going private was the best thing that could have happened to Malvinka, says
Kiselyov. &quot;As soon as the company became private we became free of
limitations. Now we're absolutely free to determine our production policies.
We do what we think is best for our company.&quot; <BR>

<H3><A NAME="oil-refining"></A>REFINING FOR RUSSIA </H3>
<B>Despite large debts and ageing equipment, the Tyumen Oil Company is willing
to find partners and expand<BR>
<BR>
</B><I>by Margie Lindsay </I><BR>
<BR>
Russia is restructuring its oil sector to create vertically integrated companies
based on the western model. Tyumen holds the majority of Russia's oil and
gas reserves yet only one of the new-style companies is based there: the
Tyumen Oil Company (TOC), which was set up in August 1995. The company has
an output of just over 20 million tonnes, a quarter of Russia's total production.
<BR>
<BR>
Basically, TOC is a holding company made up of firms allocated to it by
the government. The haste of its creation and a widely diverse portfolio
of daughter companies is proving a challenge for the new management, which
has yet to find an effective organisational structure for the new entity.
Indeed, many of its subsidiaries still act independently, ignoring central
control. <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, central control itself is still in flux. The company is in state
hands except for around 15% of its shares, which are held by employees and
management. The state's shares are held by various federal and regional
authorities but are gradually being sold at privatisation auctions. TOC
says some of the remaining state shares should be passed to the company,
but it is not clear when or how many. <BR>
<BR>
The holding company is made up of two oil production companies, one oil
refinery (Ryazan around 300km outside Moscow), and five distribution companies.
In addition TOC has a construction and geological company. <BR>
<BR>
One problems is that the company's oil refinery is over 2,000km away from
its oilfields. TOC would like to sell the Ryazan refinery and co-operate
either with a refinery closer to home or build its own facilities in Tyumen.
The capacity of the Ryazan refinery is 18 million tonnes a year but volume
in the first six months of 1995 totalled only 8.6 million tonnes. According
to a spokesman for the company, TOC would have preferred to work with Omsk
refinery, but that venture was given to another company in the reorganisation.
Many areas of TOC need modernisation. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The most important question we need to address is the reconstruction
of our largest oilfield, Samurtalosk,&quot; says a company spokesman. Over
the last 30 years production has declined and the old Soviet methods of
producing as much oil as possible with little regard to field conditions
or to the future means that recovery of secondary and tertiary oil reserves
is difficult. Western technology and know-how is needed to bring the field
back to full production. <BR>
<BR>
Added to this problem is heavy debt, caused partly by continued state control
of oil prices and partly by non-payment of debts from clients. The debt
run up by one production company, Nizhnevartovskneftegaz, is estimated at
well over Rb80.9 billion. Debts at TOC's other oil producing company, Tyumenneftegaz,
total over Rb893 billion. Along with other Russian oil companies in a similar
state, the firm is hoping to be rescued by the federal government. Indeed,
during a mid-summer visit the Russian prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin
promised some help, particularly with the repair of old wells. <BR>
<BR>
The TOC wants to expand its existing activities. Most of the region's petrol
stations and agricultural groups receive their products from TOC's distribution
companies. This could turn into an even more lucrative business as agricultural
and industrial production expand. <BR>
<BR>
The company is already developing 16 oilfields and has licences for 12 more.
But it says development of fields will be difficult because of complex geological
structures and extreme weather. <BR>
<BR>
Like other oil companies in Russia, TOC is waiting for an important oil-production
sharing law to pass parliament. Once adopted, TOC will be able to sign deals
for development of at least two new fields. &quot;But without a strong western
partner, we are not able to develop any new fields,&quot; admits a spokesman.<BR>

<H3>FROM THE EDITOR</H3> 
<H2>Search for inner balance</H2>
<H4>
Internal Clashes with the &quot;enemy within&quot;, rather than the clash
of different cultures, have clouded optimism
</H4>
As readers think of Davos and the 1996 Annual Meeting of the World Economic
Forum, taking place at the beginning of February, they may see a common
thread running through the agenda: ways of coping with our era's rapid pace
of change. Globalisation, the theme of this year's meeting, has become so
accepted as a description of the interconnected way we live, along with
the market as a basic economic institution, that attention is already shifting
to the problems that lurk under the surface of this consensus. <BR>
<BR>
In this discussion, we usually hear about the potential for conflict between
different cultures, even as their practical lives become more linked through
trade and contact. But looking at some of the most startling recent events,
such as the killing of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin late last year,
it seems to be internal clashes rather than a clash of civilisations which
are clouding optimism most. <BR>
After Rabin's murder by a Jewish fundamentalist, as in the earlier Oklahoma
bombing by US anti-federal extremists, the reality of an attack by the so-called
enemy within was far more shocking than any attack by a foreign terrorist
would have been. And in both cases the perpetrators were accused of taking
succour from more moderate groups at the heart of the polity.<BR>
<BR>
Such violent action is usually associated with political landscapes where
there is no tradition of democracy to leaven people's desire for recognition.
But these two attacks were proof of a crisis of identity and consent in
two of the world's most debate-prone societies. In both cases they were
facing the challenges of change: in the case of Israel it was that of peace
with an old enemy and in America, the difficulties of leadership in a post-Cold
War world. Every change calls for a new equilibrium: the problem lies in
getting the balance right. <BR>
<BR>
As international trade unionist Bill Jordan writes in this issue, people
risk blinding themselves with their own rhetoric about the joys of a global
society which creates losers as well as winners. World Link's blow-by-blow
account of a Volkswagen productivity workshop, a crucial part of its bid
to stay competitive in world markets, shows how fear of unemployment can
weaken enthusiasm for improvement, even in Germany where job protection
is stronger than in most countries. <BR>
<BR>
The issue posed by these writers, and by several other experts in this Davos
edition, is that while markets are important they do not have all the answers.
As Nick Cater's work on disaster relief shows, some things cannot be run
on strict market lines without losing their very purpose. Karel van Wolferen
explains how in one very successful society, Japan, the market is heavily
overshadowed by other institutions born from a war economy which defy modern
free-market orthodoxy. Chile and other reforming, democratising societies
discussed in these pages acknowlege they are now focusing more on the social
dimension and the need to maintain popular support for change; the Czechs,
despite their tough market rhetoric, always did so and this helps explain
their success.<BR>
<BR>
In a special interview the US-based analyst Francis Fukuyama develops further
his argument that the big institutions need to be supplemented with something
more intangible, and that you cannot create a liveable society based on
the self-interested interactions of individuals alone. The state is not
the answer either but if you cut it back, he warns, there is no guarantee
that civil society will fill the vacuum. <BR>
The debate has definitively moved out of the old left-right political divide,
as a new generation understands the inadequacies of old categories and moves
towards a middle ground which balances rights and duties, individual and
civic values. The search is now on, in Davos and elsewhere, for a new equilibrium.

<H3>COMMENT</H3>
<H2>The universal challenge </H2> 
<H4>The rise and relative fall of American economic dominance offers a warning
lesson to the East </H4>

<I>By Harry Harding, dean of the Elliott School of International Affairs,
George Washington University </I><BR>
<BR>
I re-read a rather well-known book recently, written by someone from a society
that has customarily regarded itself as the most advanced on earth, both
morally and materially. But as that journalist looked across a great ocean
to the west, he saw another society on the rise which challenged the superiority
of his own. <BR>
<BR>
The superficial dimensions of that challenge were economic: more rapid rates
of growth, export surges, a burst of outward foreign investment and pre-eminence
in what the writer regarded as the strategic industries of the future. Looking
beneath the surface, however, the author identified the underlying values
and institutions that were producing such economic success. These included:
<BR>
<BR>
*Superior management, which enabled the challenger's industrial and commercial
enterprises to adapt successfully in a global economy. <BR>
<BR>
*A greater commitment to education, research, and development, as reflected
in higher levels of investment in these activities. <BR>
<BR>
*The promotion of an effective and creative partnership among government,
private business, and universities. <BR>
<BR>
*Systematic and organised government sponsorship of industries in the strategic
sectors of the economy. <BR>
<BR>
*A commitment to social equality, which in the long term contributed to
higher rates of economic growth. <BR>
<BR>
The author concluded that this challenge from across the ocean posed a stark
choice to his society between insulation and competition. He argued vigorously
for competition, proposing the creation of a broad political consensus to
learn from the challenger and a concerted effort at social and economic
revitalisation in an attempt to catch up. <BR>
<BR>
This argument should sound familiar. It would not be a bad summary of an
influential book, <I>Looking at the Sun</I>, written by prominent American
journalist James Fallows about the advance of the east Asian economies over
the last several decades and their competitive challenge to the us. But
the book I have just summarised is not <I>Looking at the Sun</I>, nor is
the author an American. <BR>
<BR>
The rising economy being described is not Japan, nor wider east Asia. The
book I am referring to was written in 1967 by a Frenchman, Jean-Jacques
Servan-Schreiber. The society that traditionally considered itself superior
was Europe, the ocean separating the new and old powers was the Atlantic
and the rising power was the US. The title of the book was <I>Le D&eacute;fi
Am&eacute;ricain</I>, or <I>The American Challenge</I>. <BR>
<BR>
I pay tribute to Servan-Schreiber in part because his book parallels and
reinforces my own thesis. His description of what made the US so competitive
reinforces my judgement that such values and institutions are not specifically
Asian, as argued by many analysts, but are universal concepts strongly correlated
with economic success wherever they are applied. And by posing the choice
between insulation and competition, he echoes my argument that the US now
faces its own choice between more creative or more costly responses to the
latest challenge from Asia. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The lesson of America </B><BR>
<BR>
Any re-reading of Servan-Schreiber suggests a somewhat paradoxical conclusion.
Today, almost 30 years after this book was published, the US has lost many
of the competitive advantages that it once enjoyed. <BR>
<BR>
In retrospect, the American challenge of the '60s did not merely act as
a spur to European competitiveness. It was also a challenge for the US to
remain competitive. The tragedy of contemporary American history is that
we responded to that challenge too slowly and have done so with only limited
effectiveness. In short, we became the victims of our own success. <BR>
<BR>
It follows that the success of east Asia poses a major challenge to the
region itself: to continue to adjust and adapt lest it become the victim
of its own economic miracle. Economically, Asia faces the challenge of liberalising
both its consumer and capital markets so it can move beyond the strategies
of protected industry and state guidance that have served so well until
now. <BR>
<BR>
The need for liberalisation stems from several considerations. First, as
I have already noted, the other two major economic regions, Europe and the
US, will increasingly insist on reciprocal trading arrangements and will
demand greater access to Asian markets in return for continued access to
their own. Second, as east Asia continues to grow, it will increasingly
serve as its own economic engine. No longer will the region's economies
look to the US as the market that supports their export-oriented strategies.
Instead, they will look to each other and that will require further enhancement
of opportunities for trade and investment within the region. <BR>
<BR>
Third, to attract foreign investment whether from outside the region or
from within it, requires products manufactured or assembled in one country
to have freer access to neighbouring markets. And most fundamentally, given
the faster pace of technological change, economies remain competitive only
if capital has the freedom to move and exploit exciting new opportunities.
<BR>
<BR>
To be sure economies like Hong Kong have always been open. Others, like
Taiwan, South Korea and China, are moving in that direction. The creation
of the Asean Free Trade Area and the promulgation of the Bogor Declaration
by APEC represent a commitment to regional trade and investment liberalisation
but progress has often been slow. The enormous economic difficulties faced
by Japan illustrate the dangers when adjustment is tardy or even deliberately
postponed. <BR>
<BR>
Strategically, the challenge to Asia is very similar to that which I have
described for the US. If east Asia is to remain stable, it must create a
greater sense of shared interests and mutual security among increasingly
powerful nations which remain mistrustful despite their growing interdependence.
<BR>
<BR>
There must be concerted action to integrate fully some of the outlying nations,
particularly North Korea, into that emerging Pacific community. And there
must also be efforts to resolve security problems that could give rise to
the use of force: arms races, territorial disputes, environmental problems,
ethnic groups that span state borders, as well as poverty and instability
that could give rise to migration across national frontiers. <BR>
<BR>
The US has some responsibility to create this sense of community. But the
principal obligation lies within Asia itself. The establishment of both
bilateral and multilateral security dialogue at both the official and the
unofficial levels (one aspect of what Kishore Mahbubani recently called
&quot;The Pacific Impulse&quot;) is a most welcome and promising development.
The nations of east Asia need to ensure these new mechanisms produce mutual
transparency, improved confidence, a culture of preventive diplomacy, conflict
resolution and crisis management. And if the US has the obligation to consult
with its allies, they have a parallel responsibility to present their views
honestly, to share the risk of policy initiatives and to accept the burden
of joint leadership. <BR>
<BR>
Intellectually, the challenge for Asia is a mirror image of that facing
the US. A one-sided emphasis on what are now being called Asian values and
institutions could prove to be as detrimental to Asia as a one-sided emphasis
on so-called western values and institutions has been to the US. If taken
to extremes, respect for authority can become a damper on creativity and
innovation: emphasis on community can come at the expense of individual
rights; insistence on harmony can lead to the suppression of diversity and
dissent and one-person institutions can fall victim to favouritism and corruption.
What is fascinating is to see a new generation of Asian leaders and intellectuals
arguing that pluralism and individualism have historic roots in Asian culture
and that modern Asia needs to give these values their proper role. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The temptations of success </B><BR>
<BR>
Asia, like the US, faces a psychocultural challenge as the result of its
enormous success. It would be understandable for Asian leaders and intellectuals,
especially those who have personally experienced western colonialism and
racism, to respond by seeking to turn the tables. They could define their
identity in narrow national or even pan-Asian terms. They could argue that
it is now time to establish another hierarchical cross-cultural relationship,
but this time one in which Asia teaches and the west learns. They could
adopt their own version of the clash of civilisations theory, in which they
assert that there should be no accommodation between the Asian ethic and
western values. They could, in short, advocate a form of Asian fundamentalism,
which could provoke a cultural clash between east and west. <BR>
<BR>
This would be not only a tragic mistake, but a needless repetition of one
of the worst features of western history. To use Noordin Sopiee's phrase
in a slightly different context, the Asian opportunity is to use its economic
resurgence to join the US and Europe in an equal partnership that is based
on mutual learning and mutual respect. <BR>
<BR>
Such an approach would not only avoid a wasteful clash of civilisations,
but would present the unique prospect of a fusion of civilisations that
in turn would be a major contribution toward building a global community
that incorporates all of humanity's greatest traditions.<BR>

<H3>ON THE MOVE</H3>
<H4>AMMAN SUMMIT </H4>
<H2>Last farewell in Amman </H2>
The Middle East/North Africa economic summit, held late October, will now
be remembered as the last meeting between Israel's architect of peace and
his Arab partners. Days after the close of the summit in Jordan's capital
Amman, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was murdered by a Jewish assassin.
<BR>
<BR>
The summit meeting of Arab, Israeli and other business people had emphasised
both the potential and limitations of Middle East peace. At one of the meeting's
most revealing sessions, &quot;Is the Middle East open for business?&quot;,
William Ryrie of Baring Holdings expressed a sentiment privately held by
a number of European and American delegates: &quot;The region cannot be
said to be open for business because of barriers between countries.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
He hoped the peace process would break down some of these barriers but others
stemmed from anti-market policies and it was not yet clear they had been
rejected. Regional stock markets had also missed out on major developments
in international capital flows, he added. But despite the doubts, &quot;with
the right attitude, the Middle East could again become a region for growth.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Paul Volcker, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve and the session
moderator, said the region had big potential but added that there were many
competitors, &quot;many of them frankly ahead of the Middle East&quot;.
Volcker also sounded a warning on the proposed development bank which he
said should be small and efficient. <BR>
<BR>
Volcker said tourism is an important way of providing jobs and development
in a hurry but Yossi Beilin, Israel's economy and planning minister, disagreed:
&quot;The hypothesis is that everyone wants more tourism, but when you know
the region you realise that this is not the case. Once you know what's possible
and what's impossible, it will be much easier to attract the world.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Addressing the session theme, Youssef Boutros Ghali, Egypt's minister of
state for international co-operation said: &quot;We are asked this question
about being open for business and it is my sincere hope that next year we
won't have to ask it.&quot; But for those expressing impatience, he reminded
the audience that the Camp David accord had taken time to produce results.
<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%>
<H4>AMMAN: TRANSPORT </H4>
<H2>A line of steel in the sand </H2>
In some respects the Middle East's infrastructure is now worse than it was
during the Ottoman period, according to Ghassan Ali, vice-president of finance
at Royal Jordanian airlines. During the session on transport, Ali pointed
out that until World War I there had been a railway running from Turkey
to Egypt. The line, sabotaged by Arab forces during the war, had never been
reinstituted: &quot;It is very sad to see that 100 years ago a railway ran
through the Middle East and that it is no longer there.&quot; The region
needed a railway and north-south coastal highway, with branches peeling
off from the main trunk, he said. <BR>
<BR>
Asked whether there was a market for such an ambitious road, Ali conceded
there was probably insufficient traffic right now: &quot;But we are talking
about a new era. If these routes were feasible 100 years ago, I am sure
they would be feasible now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
If such plans are still some way off, the session on joint regional projects
stressed some of the schemes which should be among the first fruits of the
peace process. Beilin referred to the construction of 40,000 hotel rooms
over the next few years, some of them in projects run jointly with Jordan
and Egypt. Both the Dead Sea and the TEAM area (the triangle formed by Taba,
Eilat and Aqaba) have been targeted for ambitious tourist projects. An airport
which would serve both Aqaba and Eilat is also planned to straddle the border
between Israel and Jordan. <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%>
<H4>CHINA MEETING </H4>
<H2>Rural labour migration </H2>
&quot;A large segment of the rural population is feeling increasingly alienated
from what is happening in the rest of the country. Agriculture is today
one of most difficult sectors for the government to deal with,&quot; said
Claude Smadja at the opening session of the forum's annual China meeting,
held in Beijing at the end of October. <BR>
<BR>
The Swiss Broadcasting Corporation news director, soon to join the forum,
highlighted the widening gap between rural and urban income which is causing
dissatisfaction and, more importantly, internal migrations. <BR>
<BR>
By the end of 1994 there were 446 million people in the rural workforce.
Some 200 million are sufficient for agricultural production: a further 120
million work in township enterprises. This leaves well over 100 million
surplus to requirement and now on the road, flocking into cities and creating
a serious problem for social stability. <BR>
<BR>
Both Liu Jiang, minister of agriculture, and Du Ying, deputy director of
the research centre for rural economy, skirted around this theme in a packed
session devoted to reform and social stability in the agricultural sector.
<BR>
<BR>
Liu was keen to point out that agricultural production had increased substantially
- cotton production had doubled, meat had trebled and grain was up by more
than 40% - but admitted that this was not enough. &quot;Today, agriculture
as the base of China's national economy is relatively weak and lacking staying
power,&quot; he said. Liu identified the main pressures on the sector as
population growth and rural surplus labour. <BR>
<BR>
Du was swift to scotch any ideas that a migrant population might be causing
difficulties and blamed the media for exaggerating problems. He argued that
the rural and urban workforce complement each other, as most of the <I>mangliu</I>
(blind transients) work in construction where there is enough work to go
around. <BR>
<BR>
Second, he said, most workers go to the cities with the help of local government
or family and friends and third, there is no question of social instability
because most migration is seasonal. This is different from the situation
in other emerging countries where rural drift occurs because of drought
or because farmers have lost their land. <BR>
<BR>
Liu and Du were not in sharp disagreement, however: with the former repeating
some of Du's arguments. &quot;Labour migration not only provides large numbers
of low-cost workers for cities and developed regions to expedite their economic
development, but also reduces unemployment pressure in rural areas. It helps
farmers earn more income and learn new ideas and plays an important part
in vitalising the economy of labour exporting regions,&quot; he said. <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%>
<H4>CHINA: POLLUTION </H4>
<H2>Environment protection </H2>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the National Environmental Protection Agency, gave
a full report on China's ecological concerns. &quot;A weak point in China's
environmental protection work today is that existing laws are not observed
and law enforcement is not strict,&quot; he told the meeting. <BR>
<BR>
His agency had pinpointed poor management as the problem and as a result
was working hard to clean up production and incorporate self-restraint into
the modern enterprise system. He cited the example of the Huaihe River basin,
where several companies had been closed down recently. <BR>
<BR>
The problem is now considerable. Although GNP has been growing, so too has
energy consumption - one of the main causes of pollution. Compared to developed
countries, China consumes more coal per head which produces a frightening
1.4 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide and 15 million tonnes of smoke. But
less than 0.8% of GNP was being spent on the prevention and treatment of
pollution. <BR>
<BR>
A four-step programme had been introduced to achieve the agency's objectives,
he explained. The first was to implement a sustainable development strategy.
The second was to set up an environmental legal system to punish criminal
behaviour and enforce those laws. The third was to strengthen industrial
pollution prevention in urban areas. And the fourth was to invest in the
environment and get international assistance. &quot;China will welcome and
support any cooperation and exchanges that help improve its environmental
quality,&quot; he said. <BR>
<BR>
In spite of the difficulties, Xie's conclusion was optimistic: &quot;Let
us advance hand in hand and create together a new era of green civilisation
for mankind.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=60%>
<H4>INDIA MEETING </H4>
<H2>Dream of an opportunity </H2>
No one among those present at the forum's India meeting, held in New Delhi
on December 3-5, was sceptical about the range and scale of opportunities
in the country. Instead, participants focused on the manner of welcome they
were likely to receive. Finance minister Manmohan Singh, who seemed to sense
these apprehensions, tried to put the assembled foreign delegates at ease.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;India is not going to go back to the old ways,&quot; he said. &quot;We
will continue to work towards the further opening of the Indian economy...
and create in our country an environment conducive to greater inflow of
foreign direct investment.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
All the signals emanating from Delhi over the past few months, however,
seemed clearly to suggest otherwise. Doubts on the incumbent Congress government's
ability to return to power with a clear majority after the general election,
due in the middle of this year, were freely expressed by delegates at the
Delhi meeting. Political expediency, many noted, has meant putting the macroeconomic
stabilisation programme on the back burner and economic reform back in the
freezer. The old ways are startlingly in evidence. And even as the WEF meeting
was in session, the country's claim to an &quot;open system&quot; was put
to the test with opposition parties insisting on the repeal of licences
being sought by prospective basic telecom operators. Nor have the problems
faced by Kentucky Fried Chicken, whose Delhi outlet was closed apparently
for hygiene reasons, provided evidence of a &quot;conducive environment&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
Delegates looking at the possibility of investing in India were even taken
through a DIY session that concentrated on the pros and cons of entry as
well as the partner selection process. But most concerns remained unanswered.
<BR>
<BR>
The other main architect of the economic reform programme, commerce minister
P Chidambaram, addressed delegates at the opening dinner and as usual exuded
confidence on prospects for the Indian economy. <BR>
<BR>
Data on industrial production and foreign trade looked healthy enough, he
noted. Chidambaram forecast that trade-led GDP growth could reach 8% annually
by the turn of the century and even top 10% thereafter. &quot;With a dream
and a little luck, Indian exports could cross the $75 billion line by 2000,&quot;
he said, although recognising that at present the country's infrastructure
was inadequate for that dream to come true. Most delegates at the sectoral
workshops bemoaned infrastructural constraints but offered little by way
of solutions. <BR>
<BR>
India. traditionally Eurocentric, at last appears to realise the potential
benefits of a broad-spectrum partnership with its Asean neighbours. Both
minister for external affairs Pranab Mukherji and his articulate minister
of state, Salman Khurshid, appeared to commit India firmly to regional economic
institutions. <BR>
<BR>
Notwithstanding the observations of the former deputy prime minister of
Thailand, Supachai Panitchpakdi, substantial ground remains to be covered
before that becomes a reality. Asean looks at India with a hint of hesitation
bordering on suspicion, justifiable or otherwise. <BR>
<BR>
A more consistent interaction of business leaders of the region could help
mend matters. <BR>

<H2>Lucid chaos </H2>
<H4>Nature's Numbers </H4>
<I>By Ian Stewart<BR>
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson &#163;9.99 </I>
<B>Five Golden Rules: Great Theories of 20th Century Mathematics -
and Why They Matter </B>
<I>By John Casti<BR>
Wiley $24.95/&#163;16.99 <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reviewed by Lance Knobel </B></I><BR>
<BR>
Mathematics has preserved its power to terrorise a large portion of the
adult population, who recall youthful struggles with equations and dry,
uninteresting teachers. At my university - where undergraduates were
required to learn a foreign language, take at least a year of natural sciences
and obtain a basic grounding in history and literature - the so-called
arts faculty annually defeated scientist-led proposals to require at least
one year of mathematics for every student. <BR>
<BR>
The scientists persisted in their annual battle because they understood
that mathematics provides the basis for understanding much of our world.
In fact mathematics' encroachment into other realms has been accelerating:
it conquered physics early in this century (or in Newton's time, depending
on your viewpoint), chemistry succumbed by mid-century and biology has become
truly infused by mathematics only within the last 20 years. The power of
our desktop computers and the programs which run on them rests entirely
on mathematical manipulations. <BR>
<BR>
But the importance of mathematics stems not from its applications but from
its essence: its logic, its adherence to rigorous proof, its ability to
construct an internally consistent world from nothing more than intellectual
power. The popular hostility to mathematics arises from the rarity with
which teachers or writers can convey its sheer beauty. Fortunately, two
recent books do much to right the wrongs of bad teachers past. <BR>
<BR>
Ian Stewart's <I>Nature's Numbers</I> is part of the excellent Science Masters
series in which leading practitioners provide a lucid account of contemporary
thinking in their field. Stewart's own work deals chiefly with the effects
of symmetry on dynamics, with applications to pattern formation and chaos
theory. The book does not attempt to embrace all mathematics, but focuses
instead on patterns in nature and the ways mathematics can help us explain
and understand them. He writes: &quot;Between the behaviour we observe and
the laws that produce it is a crevasse, which the human mind can bridge
only by mathematical calculations.&quot; The examples he cites are wide-ranging:
from the evolution of the eye to the dynamics of the solar system. Unsurprisingly,
given his own professional interests, the best parts of the book deal with
chaos and complexity. The extended discussion of how water drips from a
tap, in particular, conveys some key insights of so-called chaoticians better
than the old saw about a butterfly flapping its wings in China. <BR>
<BR>
In the gentlest possible way, Stewart also introduces the reader to some
mathematics, such as the calculus that Newton developed for his laws of
motion. But Stewart steers away from anything so frightening as equations.
He presumably took the advice of Stephen Hawking's editor that every equation
in a book cuts its sales in half. <BR>
<BR>
Casti, author of <I>Five Golden Rules</I>, has no such qualms. He plainly
states in his preface that his ideal reader has a &quot;sophisticated&quot;
background in mathematics: &quot;The book is for anyone who's not afraid
to confront real mathematical <I>ideas</I> - head-on.&quot; According
to Casti, high school algebra or geometry should suffice; I was glad to
have completed two years of university-level maths. <BR>
<BR>
That said, for those willing to persevere Casti's book is immensely rewarding.
In pithy language and with a modicum of well-explained equations, he introduces
the reader to the Minimax Theorem from which much of game theory derives,
the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem on topology, Morse's Theorem on singularity
or catastrophe theory, the Halting Theorem on the theory of computation
and the Simplex Method on optimisation theory. According to Casti, these
five theorems pass the tests of significance, beauty and scope, application,
proof method and philosophical implications. <BR>
<BR>
To the non-mathematician, virtually everything in the book will be new.
But Casti worries that readers will complain that he is dealing with old
mathematics: the most recent theorem, the Simplex Method, dates from the
late 1940s. The self-stated answer to these concerns is that the theorems
gave rise to great theories which are still evolving. &quot;Generally speaking,
it seems to take at least a generation or two for a great theorem to 'grow
up', that is, to be recognised as the seed from which a great theory has
subsequently grown,&quot; he writes. <BR>
<BR>
Some idea of the brilliant span of this book can be gauged by the series
of examples that crop up in the discussion of singularity theory: why bridges
collapse, developmental biology and the mathematics of joke-telling. Even
as a mathematically inclined layperson, I had believed that contemporary
mathematics was rapidly straying completely out of reach for the non-professional.
Casti proves otherwise. <I>Five Golden Rules</I> is probably the most difficult
book you will read this year, but it may also be the most exhilarating.

<H2>Failed dreams </H2>
<H4>Start Up </H4>
<I>By Jerry Kaplan<BR>
Houghton Mifflin, $22.95 <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reviewed by Andrew Clark</B></I><B> </B><BR>
<BR>
In 1987, Gerry Kaplan thought he had an idea which would transform the computer
industry. It was to develop a laptop onto which the user could write directly
with a pen, without any need for a keyboard. The result would be small enough
to fit in a briefcase which the jet-setting executive could use like a notebook.
In <I>Start Up</I> Kaplan chronicles the birth and eventual death of the
company he set up to market this idea. He gives a detailed insight into
the trials of a small venture trying to succeed in an unsentimental market.
On the way, he dishes the dirt on many major players in the computer industry.
<BR>
<BR>
The pen computer has not taken off, but Kaplan regarded himself as a pioneer
in almost evangelical pursuit of his dream. At times he overdoes the &quot;vision
thing&quot;. When he first has the idea, on a corporate jet somewhere over
the Rocky Mountains, he writes: &quot;This unique emotion - the modern
scientific version of religious epiphany - is startling in its raw
power and purity.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Although this frankness is corny it is also the great strength of the book.
As the vision disintegrates Kaplan allows all his petulant bitterness to
come through. Among those particularly targeted is Microsoft chairman Bill
Gates. Through Kaplan's eyes, Gates appears petty, scheming and utterly
obsessed with point-scoring. He adds: &quot;Gates always seemed to be trying
to prove that he was smarter than everyone else, and this competitiveness
pervaded the entire company.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
There follows a description of how Microsoft quietly developed a rival pen
computing system to rival GO, Kaplan's company. The allegations he then
details were made available to the US Federal Trade Commission in an investigation
of anti-trust violations by Microsoft. They cannot be detailed here because
of British libel laws. <BR>
<BR>
In general, Kaplan tends to regard large corporations as ideologically impure.
He criticises IBM, saying its developmental help was marked by delays which
made the relationship a millstone around the neck of the small company.
Apple, which aggressively promotes its own pen computer, is also assailed.
<BR>
<BR>
<I>Start Up</I> manages to build up a surprising amount of dramatic tension
for a corporate biography and is interesting both as an inside view of the
computer industry and as a portrait of a small and often unorthodox company
run by a man with an enthusiastic, hands-on technique. Although Kaplan's
story is not a wholly happy one, it does not put one off starting up with
an bright idea. <BR>

<H2>Matter over mind </H2>
<H4>Landscape and Memory </H4>
<I>By Simon Schama <BR>
HarperCollins, &#163;30 <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reviewed by Susan Greenberg</B></I><B> </B><BR>
<BR>
For people who do not like their reading to come in narrow categories, the
name of this author has become an instant recommendation. Schama, professor
of humanities at Columbia University, always approaches history at a fresh
angle, his projects crammed with observations that show the scope of his
comparative mind. <BR>
<BR>
His theme this time, the human relationship to landscape and nature, is
not as obviously controversial as the French revolution, the subject of
the earlier work <I>Citizens</I> which challenged accepted notions of modernity,
but as millenial gloom gathers about the future of the planet it is the
environmentalist criticism of progress which looms large on the western
political scene. <BR>
<BR>
Schama engages with this and reminds us, as any good historian should, that
the things we take for granted in fact shift constantly in our own memory,
including the current widespread perception of nature and society as separate
and antagonistic, with only cave-dwellers exempt from original sin. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;If the entire history of landscape in the west is indeed just a mindless
race toward a machine-driven universe, uncomplicated by myth, metaphor and
allegory... then we are indeed trapped in the engine of our self-destruction,&quot;
he writes. But despite the real damage done to the world, the human occupation
of the landscape should be cause for celebration: &quot;Landscapes are culture
before they are nature; constructs of the imagination projected onto wood
and water and rock.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The book is divided into three main parts covering those three elements.
There are plenty of insights throughout, including on how nature is reflected
in art (see painting above), but the best section deals with the forest
which in Germany embodied militaristic spirit, in France the passion for
order, in England liberty and in Poland the struggle for national freedom.
<BR>
<BR>
Schama uses what his old teacher called &quot;the archive of the feet&quot;
and visits the landscape of his lumberjack Jewish ancestors in northeastern
Poland, &quot;a country where frontiers march back and forth to the abrupt
commands of history&quot;. He charts how the forest became a carrier of
national memory following the 18th century carve-up of Poland. In one interesting
cross-reference, Schama describes a meeting in 1829 between the exiled Polish
romantic<B> </B>writer Adam<B> </B>Mickiewicz with his American counterpart
James Fennimore Cooper, Polish sympathiser and author of <I>Last of the
Mohicans</I> which marked the dying and suppressed native American culture.
<BR>
<BR>
During a brief period of nationhood before Poland was swallowed up again,
its leaders tried to wine and dine Adolf Hitler's most compulsive hunter
Hermann G&ouml;ring at the Bielawieza forest lodge. G&ouml;ring typified
the Nazi obsession with the idea of a pure German woodland warrior race:
in the Third Reich vivisection was punished by the concentration camp &quot;where
the medical staff was less fussy about operating on humans than hounds&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
Schama resists reducing the fabled German relationship to the forest to
simple bleakness, however, through a detailed account of the hunt for a
German identity. It starts with the first century Roman historian Cornelius
Tacitus whose work <I>Germania, On the Origin and Situation of the Germans</I>,
a picture of a fighting forest people, became the &quot;birth certificate
of the German race&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
In Britain woodland is a more cosy and inhabited place where the &quot;blood
pact turned into mere bloody-mindedness&quot;. The fable of Robin Hood dates
from a 1308 story about a yeoman who rebelled when obliged to pay for wood
gathered in the earl's forest. <BR>
<BR>
When ship timber became the stuff of empire, the native oak tree became
the symbol of British liberty, like its people seen as &quot;tight-pored,
tough-grained, inhospitable to pests, watertight and long-lived&quot;. In
a race with rival France for ship timber, Britain complained that because
of the many common liberties limiting royal rule, it could not compete with
King Louis' centralised powers to conscript his own forest by fiat, &quot;as
if conscripting militia&quot;, a familiar complaint to modern ears. <BR>

<H4>The Aachen Memorandum </H4>
<I>By Andrew Roberts<BR>
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson, &#163;15.99 </I>
<B>Michael Portillo: The Future of the Right </B>
<I>By Michael Gove<BR>
Fourth Estate, &#163;20 <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reviewed by Adrian Murdoch</B></I><B> </B><BR>
<BR>
In the British Clubland novel of the '20s and '30s, the bogeymen were Germans,
Jews and industrialists. Since World War II they have been Americans and
Russians in more or less equal quantities. In the '90s, the target is fast
becoming Europe. In Britain at least, Brussels has become the Pavlovian
trigger for the church-going, monarchy-supporting and country-loving part
of the population to start foaming at the mouth. The writers of both of
these books, from the Euro-sceptic right-wing of the Conservative Party,
do for closer European integration what George Orwell did for communism
in the political satire <I>Animal Farm</I>. Although the former work masquerades
as a futuristic thriller and the latter as a biography of a leading young
British politician, it is no coincidence that both were released on the
eve of a Conservative Party conference and the authors thank each other
in their prefaces. <BR>
<BR>
<I>The Aachen Memorandum</I> is perhaps the more credible of the two and
owes something in style to Robert Harris' bestseller <I>Fatherland</I> .
Set in 2045 on the 100th anniversary of the end of World War II in the British
region of the European superstate, it tells of the skulduggery uncovered
by the hero Horatio Lestoq over the ratification of the final surrender
to Europe 30 years previously. From the murder of an old admiral to a climax
which brings down the superstate in London's Hyde Park involving King William,
who now rules only in New Zealand, this book is likely to send Euro-sceptics
off into a protracted series of ecstatic shudders. <BR>
<BR>
But Roberts is describing less an Orwellian vision of the future than the
dangers of the modern-day Europe run from Brussels, and indeed the author's
political friends have publicly compared EU commissioners to Nazi <I>gauleiters.
</I>He tugs shamelessly at loyalty to icons of Britain's national heritage
and identity. The hero is self-consciously named Horatio after Admiral Nelson,
slayer of the French, the Houses of Parliament renamed the Westminster Heritage,
Amenity and Leisuredrome and Buckingham Palace - now the regional headquarters
of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - is dubbed
Attali House after the former much-criticised EBRD chief. It is interesting
to ponder whether any other country in Europe would get away with such blatant,
although in this case amusing, tub-thumping. <BR>
<BR>
Whereas Roberts succeeds by virtue of historical legerdemain and fantasy
- he is a historian by training from Cambridge - Oxford-educated
Gove has less success writing on Michael Portillo, Britain's defence secretary.
Many would argue that a biography of a young politician, even one as charismatic
as Portillo, is premature. With chapters that amble through his Spanish
origins (he is known to relatives as <I>Miguelito</I>)<I>, </I>Cambridge
and his conversion to Conservatism, his time as chief secretary at the Treasury
up to his recent posting at the defence ministry, it seems curious that
anyone would spend &#163;20 on a book about a politician whose career is
probably only starting. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless there are few politicians on the European stage who incite
such violent feeling in both directions. One journalist cited halfway through
the book comments: &quot;Portillo is cold, sensual and superior and smart
enough to know that those qualities can work for him. The Castilian stallion
excites men with the smack of firm government and has every woman in the
land reaching for the basque separates.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
What would make the book genuinely interesting is its subtitle, &quot;The
Future of the Right of the Right&quot;. Sadly this is the issue Gove hardly
touches, not even questioning whether the right has a future at all. There
is little on economics, nothing on the first recession of 1982 and only
one paragraph on the late '80s crash. In fact the book raises more questions
than it answers. Why is Portillo the future? How clever can a man be who
gaffed by suggesting that foreigners buy their A-levels ? Those looking
for answers will be disappointed. <BR>

<H2>Kafka's lover </H2>
<H4>Kafka, Love and Courage: the life of Milena Jesenska </H4>
<I>By Mary Hockaday<BR>
Andre Deutsch, &#163;17.99 <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reviewed by Francis Harris</B></I><B> </B><BR>
<BR>
Franz Kafka is not widely regarded as one of the century's wittiest men.
Yet in love and in private, he had his moments. Writing to his Czech lover
Milena Jesenska, he describes a dream: &quot;You were completely lost to
me. In my despair I made several very cunning attempts which, however, I
don't know why, were not carried through and of which I remember only one.
I wrote on an envelope 'Milena', and under it, 'I beg that this letter be
delivered otherwise the Ministry of Finance will suffer an enormous loss'.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Kafka's intuitive sense of 20th century madness is easier to understand
through his letters to Milena, although sadly her replies have been lost.
The correspondence is well known, yet the woman who inspired Kafka's confidence
has been a rather shadowy figure. This is a shame because Milena Jesenska,
Prague bourgeois, wild child, unhappy wife and wartime resister, was a talented
and remarkable woman. <BR>
<BR>
In fact, her relationship with Kafka occupied no more than a chapter of
her short but busy life. They met in Prague during World War I, on the caf&eacute;
circuit in one of Europe's oldest and most vibrant communities where Czechs,
Germans and Jews shared a city, if not a culture, a Slav woman and Jewish
man discovering an all-too-rare common ground before the arrival of war
<BR>
<BR>
At one level, Milena and Kafka charted an alternative to the approaching
holocaust. &quot;German is my mother tongue and therefore natural to me,&quot;
he wrote to her just after the first war ended. &quot;But Czech feels to
me far more intimate, which is why your letter dispels many an uncertainty.
I see you clearer, the movements of your body, your hands, so quick, so
determined, it's almost a meeting, although when I try to raise my eyes
to your face, then in the flow of the letter - what a story! -
fire breaks out and I see nothing but fire.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Although the couple barely spent any time together (four intense days in
Vienna and an unsuccessful day in Gmund), and although the relationship
was unconsummated, this was a passionate love affair with enough heat to
turn Plato's hair white. Without a clear goal, suffering the burden of his
neurotic anxiety and her conflicting desires, the relationship soon burned
itself out. Four years later, he was dead of physical sickness and mental
anguish, provoking a last tribute from his former lover who wrote of a Kafka
&quot;so painfully conscious that he heard even where others, the deaf,
felt safe&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Journalism provided a new living as Milena shed her husband and returned
to Prague from Vienna. Milena and her newly created country of Czechoslovakia
did not have long. In 1938 the young democracy was sold out by Britain and
France to Hitler at Munich and the Czechs were alone and friendless in a
brutal world. Enlightened nationalists like Milena faced an appalling dilemma
of whether to resist and die, go into barren exile or collaborate with the
enemy. <BR>
<BR>
She chose resistance, helping Jews to escape, and died in Ravensbruck concentration
camp in 1944 mourned by many of those who had known her. A true heroine
for her necessarily faithless times, she had rejected both communism and
Nazism and instead chose to answer only to her heart. <BR>
<BR>
The author became my friend when we were correspondents in Prague covering
the revolution that ended communism. She has done justice not only to a
difficult and complicated subject but also to the fascinating wealth of
central European society and its sad and too-often realised potential for
unrelieved evil. <p>

<H3>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</H3> 
<H2>Forum Insights</H2>
<H4>1995 China Meeting </H4>
<B>Beijing October 30 to November 1 </B><BR>
<BR>
The two-day meeting brought together some 90 participants from China and
over 100 business leaders from abroad for discussions entitled China's new
economic challenges, focusing on the government's moves to stabilise the
economy, to push for reform and to create new impetus for the agricultural
sector. <BR>
<BR>
In addition to Economic and Trade Commission Chairman Wang Zhongyu, Agriculture
Minister Liu Jiang and Internal Trade Minister Chen Bangzhu, over 40 Chinese
academics, government and business personalities took an active role in
the programme. Foreign personalities included Swiss economy minister Jean-Pascal
Delamuraz, Japan External Trade Organisation Executive Director Takehiko
Kondo and Klaus Regling, Director General of the German Ministry of Finance.
Co-chairs for the meeting from the Chinese side were Zhao Weichen, Chairman
of China United Telecommunications Corporation, and Pan Chenglie, Deputy
Director General of the China Enterprise Management Association (CEMA),
the World Economic Forum's host partner. <BR>
<BR>
One session was devoted to the government's key challenge of ensuring a
better balance between regions competing for investment: in addition to
vice-mayors from Beijing and Dalian, the mayors of Qiqihar (Heilongjiang
Province) and Wujin City (Jiangsu Province), the vice-governor of Gansu
Province enthusiastically presented the attractions of his region. Another
session looked at the obstacles remaining in China's path before joining
the WTO. Three priority areas for foreign partnership will be the ambitious
programme for telecommunications, infrastructure development and the reform
of the financial sector. <BR>
<BR>
Participants were pleased to be received at the Great Hall of the People
for the traditional Official Call by the newly appointed vice-premier Wu
Bangguo, in charge of industry and transportation. Addressing participants'
concerns, Mr Wu spoke of the need to reform and improve the efficiency of
state-owned enterprises, one of the government priorities set out in the
latest Five-Year Plan (1996-2000). What will be the impact on social stability?

<H4>1995 Middle East/ North Africa Economic Summit </H4>
<BR>
<B>October 29-31, Amman, Jordan <BR>
<BR>
Amman Declaration</B><BR>
<BR>
On October 29-31 1995, the second Middle East/North Africa Economic Summit
was held in Amman, Jordan under the patronage of His Majesty King Hussein
bin Talal. The Summit, co-sponsored by the United States and the Russian
Federation, with the support of the European Union, Canada and Japan, brought
together government and business leaders from the Middle East and North
Africa, Europe, the Americas and Asia. <BR>
<BR>
Summit participants thank His Majesty King Hussein for his able leadership
and for the extraordinary efforts by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to
make this Summit a success. The participants also expressed their appreciation
for the partnership of the World Economic Forum, which assisted so ably
in organising this event. <BR>
<BR>
The goals of the Summit were to facilitate the expansion of private sector
investment in the region, to cement a public-private partnership which will
ensure that end, and to work to enhance regional cooperation and development.
<BR>
<BR>
In this spirit, business leaders from the Middle East, North Africa and
other regions were able to conclude a number of significant commercial and
business transactions at the Summit that will help augment the productive
capacity of the region and contribute to its broad-based economic development.
These ventures involved projects in the fields of tourism, telecommunications
and transportation. Reflecting this public-private partnership, a number
of these ventures will benefit from government guarantees, technical assistance
and other support from the international community. <BR>
<BR>
Government representatives conducted a series of negotiations over the past
year on institutional arrangements as called for in the Casablanca Declaration
which would help underpin the peace process. In this respect, the following
agreements have been reached: <BR>
<BR>
* A Bank for Economic Cooperation and Development in the Middle East and
North Africa will be established in Cairo. The Bank - as described
in its draft articles - will be structured to promote development of
the private sector, support regional infrastructure projects and provide
a Forum to promote regional economic cooperation. The Task Force will finalise
its negotiations by December 31, 1995 and will continue to explore proposals
for the creation of a project preparation and financial intermediation facility.
Those wishing to join the Bank will begin their national ratification processes
thereafter. Others wish to leave open the option of joining the Bank at
a later date, in light of the evolution of institutional arrangements and
other developments. The Economic Summit will review this issue at its next
meeting. <BR>
<BR>
* The establishment of a Regional Tourism Board, the Middle East-Mediterranean
Travel and Tourism Association, to facilitate tourism and promote the region
as a unique and attractive tourist destination. The Board will include both
public and private representatives. <BR>
<BR>
* The establishment of a Regional Business Council to promote cooperation
and trade among the private sectors of the countries of the region. <BR>
<BR>
* The formal inauguration of the Economic Summit Executive Secretariat,
which is located in Rabat and works to advance the public-private partnership,
promoting contacts, sharing data and fostering private sector investment
in the region. The participants expressed their appreciation to the Moroccan
Government for its contribution to this effort, and confirmed their support
for its ongoing activities. <BR>
<BR>
As a complement to the regional institutions called for at Casablanca, the
Steering Group of the Multilateral Peace Negotiations has decided to establish
REDWG Monitoring Committee Secretariat as a permanent regional economic
institution to be based in Amman. All participating parties have agreed
that this institution will promote and strengthen regional economic cooperation
in the Middle East and North Africa. The regional parties strongly recommend
that the Secretariat's activities will cover the range of sectors within
the REDWG Monitoring Committee's work, i.e. infrastructure, tourism, trade,
finance, and areas within the Copenhagen Plan of Action. The core parties
in close consultation with the European Union and other members of the Monitoring
Committee undertake to finalise the appropriate document on the structure
and operational functions of this institution, which will be submitted to
the next meeting of the REDWG plenary, with a view to the commencement of
the institution's activities in the first half of 1996. This REDWG plenary
will consider the matter, take appropriate action and report to the upcoming
meeting of the Multilateral Steering Group. <BR>
<BR>
The participants at the Summit expressed their strong support for continued
progress in the peace process begun at Madrid exactly four years ago, and
the importance of achieving a comprehensive peace. Participants took particular
note of advances made in the past year. Summit participants welcomed the
signing of the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, and took favourable note of the significant progress made in
implementing the Treaty of Peace between Israel and Jordan. The Summit welcomed
the decision to organise in Paris, in December 1995, the Ministerial Conference
on Economic Assistance for the Palestinians. <BR>
<BR>
The Summit also took note of the positive contribution made towards peace
by multilateral working groups. While welcoming an increasingly positive
atmosphere of openness in the region, the Summit recognised that the circle
of peace needs to be widened. Participants expressed the hope that peace
agreements between Israel and Syria and Israel and Lebanon would be concluded
as soon as possible. The Summit welcomed significant steps taken by regional
parties to the Taba Declaration and by the GCC with regard to lifting the
boycott on Israel, and expressed its support for additional efforts to end
the boycott. <BR>
<BR>
The participants at the Summit declared their intent to implement as soon
as possible the understandings reached in Amman. With respect to commercial
activities, the business representatives reaffirmed their intention to follow
through on the commercial ventures reached here and to explore new opportunities
to expand trade and investment in the region. On the part of government,
the officials attending the Summit declared their intention to support the
activities of the private sector, most particularly by getting the new institutions
established in Amman up and running as soon as possible. The participants
also welcomed the measures taken by regional parties to open their economies
and join the global economy. <BR>
<BR>
To continue such a process whose blueprint and institutions have been established
here, in Amman today, two brotherly countries announced their interest to
host the next session of the MENA Summit. They are Qatar and Egypt. <BR>
<BR>
His Majesty King Hussein conducted the necessary consultations with the
distinguished representatives of the two brotherly states, as well as with
other interested parties. He gladly announced that Qatar has graciously
conceded its offer to host the next summit in favour of Egypt, who will
host it. And it has been agreed by all, including Jordan, the present host,
as well as Egypt and others, that Qatar will be the venue of the Middle
East/North Africa Economic Summit in 1997. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The Business Interactive Group</B> <BR>
<BR>
The Middle East/North Africa Economic Summit in Amman launches one of the
world's most crucial regions on the path towards sustained economic development.
It also testifies to the region's determination to claim its place in the
global village by speaking with deeds rather than with words. The international
business community welcomes the fact that the Summit created regional institutions
to foster economic cooperation and develop and exploit the region's vast
business opportunities. By doing so, it sends a strong message: &quot;The
Middle East is opening up for business.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Yet, recognising that peace is good for business is not sufficient to attract
the foreign investment needed to rebuild and restructure the Middle East
and North Africa. Governments must also demonstrate that they realise that
business is good for peace. They must do so quickly if they wish to compete
with other regions of the world. To achieve this, governments must ensure
political stability and create an environment conducive to business in which
foreign investors feel both welcome and secure. This requires seemingly
simple demands, which in practice could involve radical change. <BR>
<BR>
Politically, Middle Eastern and North African governments must <BR>
<BR>
* project themselves as a cohesive unit eager to compete with other emerging
markets of the world <BR>
<BR>
* eliminate all restrictions on trade including the Arab boycott of Israel
<BR>
<BR>
* develop regional networks backed by sovereign guarantees in areas such
as petroleum pipelines, electricity generation and distribution, communications,
tourism and water <BR>
<BR>
* create mechanisms to shield business from political risk <BR>
<BR>
* foster broad acceptance of a free-market mentality, which views profit-making
as a virtue. <BR>
<BR>
To attract foreign investment, governments must also demonstrate that they
endorse the principles of good government and the rule of law. They can
do so by <BR>
<BR>
* stamping out corruption - a factor influencing business investment
decisions worldwide <BR>
<BR>
* enforcing universally sound and fair business ethics and practices <BR>
<BR>
* streamlining government to become cost efficient and customer oriented
<BR>
<BR>
* adopting transparency and accountability as the guiding principles of
their operations <BR>
<BR>
* creating mechanisms for resolving commercial disputes <BR>
<BR>
* promoting management as a professional skill <BR>
<BR>
* developing national and regional marketing and sales skills. <BR>
<BR>
Last but not least, to create an investor-friendly climate, governments
must <BR>
<BR>
* lift all controls from prices to foreign exchange to interest rates <BR>
<BR>
* lift all restrictions on foreign ownership <BR>
<BR>
* adopt international standards <BR>
<BR>
* introduce stable and well-defined monetary policies <BR>
<BR>
* accelerate privatisation and ensure broad-based public participation.

vital for carrying the region towards growth and stability. Participants
will gain firsthand knowledge of what can be expected in terms of reforms,
privatisation and regional integration. <BR>
<BR>
Last year participants made a series of concrete recommendations necessary
to build a strong and vibrant economy to Southern Africa's government leaders.
In 1996 chief executives and senior board members from around the world
will evaluate what progress has been achieved since last year in these areas.
The leaders of the relevant international and regional organisations will
also join us to contribute to our business-driven programme. <BR>
<BR>
Although we will look at policy issues facing the region, the backbone of
our programme will be to match Southern African business leaders with their
international counterparts. Heavy emphasis will also be placed on presenting
concrete projects open for investment in both national and regional dimensions.

<H2>Sleep and be merry </H2>
<H4>Sleep is now recognised as essential for a healthy and efficient life,
but macho preconceptions still exist </H4>
<I>By Andrew Clark </I><BR>
<BR>
The world record-holder for wakefulness, a 17-year-old student from San
Diego, lasted 11 days before succumbing to slumber. During this time he
experienced blurred vision, confusion about his identity, memory lapses,
irritability and the odd hallucination. Happily, he suffered no long-term
effects from the experiment. <BR>
<BR>
Many of us would no doubt prefer to sleep for 11 days than to challenge
this masochistic record. For most of us, tiredness is an all-too-familiar
feeling. In the morning, you feel heavy-limbed and your head aches. Later
in the day your eyelids itch and start to burn and you have to fight to
keep them open. Work suddenly seems far more complicated and far less interesting.
A common reaction is to grab a coffee. You may catch up on your sleep debt
at the weekend or ride the storm until a less hectic period arrives. <BR>
<BR>
For many working people, tiredness is a chronic condition. Working hours
are inexorably increasing, as firms lay off workers to become more efficient.
According to the American Management Association, days lasting 13 or 14
hours are not uncommon. Add to this any sort of social life and sleep goes
out of the window. Around 58% of Americans grab on average less than seven
hours' sleep per night and this pattern is mirrored around the world. Robert
Farney, of the Intermountain Sleep Disorders Centre in Salt Lake City, is
worried. He stresses that between seven and eight hours' sleep per night
is optimal: &quot;We tend to be a sleep-deprived, caffeine-driven society.
When we cut something out, we cut out sleep.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
We are all aware that insufficient sleep can impair our alertness, affecting
our work capacity and often making us moody. Now some researchers suspect
that long-term physical health problems can result. There is little doubt
that heart disease is more common among overworked and under-rested executives
but whether this is down to sleep deficiency is uncertain. Recent research
has involved keeping rats awake around the clock to observe the effect on
their bodies. Exhausted and emaciated, they all died within a month, showing
similar symptoms to patients suffering from Aids and cancer. <BR>
<BR>
So could this happen to you? James Kiley, director of the Washington-based
National Centre on Sleep Disorders Research, says sleep is like any other
vital bodily function. &quot;If you don't eat or don't drink, eventually
there will be a collapse of your body organs: you can't do without it.&quot;
Sleep deprivation, he says, causes a breakdown in the immune system and
severely aggravates any existing disease present in the body. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sleep theories on the brain </B><BR>
<BR>
James Horn, professor and director of the sleep research centre at Loughborough
University, is sceptical about the evidence for this. He points out that
it is less than common for people to go without sleep for a month like the
experimental rats. Given the degree of sleep deprivation even the most over-worked
individual may experience, he says, &quot;there is no evidence that sleep
deprivation causes problems with any body function from the neck down. The
only effect is on the brain.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Horn is adamant that the dangers of tiredness lie in the stress surrounding
hectic lifestyles. He maintains that the health risk of overwork depends
on the individuals' attitudes to their jobs. &quot;A 12-hour day is silly
but it depends on the job. There are times when work can be very relaxing.
If you're on top of your work and enjoying it, it's not stressful.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The Californian adolescent referred to earlier noticed that the effects
of his sleep deprivation occurred cyclically: many of the worst hallucinations
occurred in the early morning. This indicates the importance of circadian
rhythms, which make up the body's biological clock of rest and wakefulness.
Disruption of these rhythms takes time to get used to. When flying across
time zones, the body becomes unhappy and disorientated. Similarly, shift
workers experience a time-lag as they attempt to change their sleeping patterns
to adjust to different shifts. According to Simon Folkard, professor of
psychology at Swansea University, the body takes up to a week to adjust
even to the one-hour change in clocks at the start and end of British Summer
Time. The clocks go back on a Sunday morning and people find themselves
waking early until the following Thursday. Just one hour less sleep than
usual has a detrimental effect on productivity the next day. <BR>
<BR>
The body's circadian rhythms are affected by light and temperature. Bright
light is helpful in keeping people awake at night. According to a recent
article in <I>Sleep</I>, the industry's own magazine, shift-workers make
fewer mistakes and can be more productive in very well-lit environments.
Apparently, the darker the environment the more the brain secretes a hormone
called melatonin, which causes drowsiness. Melatonin capsules have become
the latest fashion in some circles, used by jetlagged travellers or shift
workers to help them sleep at convenient times. Caroline Evans of the British
Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) is dubious about melatonin, pointing
out that frequent travellers could end up in hooked on the drug: &quot;It
would pose difficulties for medical checks,&quot; she adds. Loughborough's
Horn adds that melatonin may interfere with the menstrual cycle and cautions
against its use for women of reproductive age. <BR>
<BR>
As far as the relief of jet lag is concerned, Folkard is unsympathetic.
&quot;Businessmen bring it upon themselves,&quot; he observes. &quot;They
should fly less frequently.&quot; He consents to offer a few more helpful
tips, however. Instead of watching films and eating throughout the flight,
passengers should adjust their watches to the new time zone as soon as they
board the plane and get used to sleeping at appropriate times. By doing
this, they shorten the period of disorientation on arrival. He adds that
alcohol should be avoided during flights, since it contributes to the body's
dehydration in the pressurised cabin. <BR>
<BR>
Pilots on some airlines are now permitted to take scheduled naps during
long-haul flights, although Balpa stresses that this is only appropriate
if at least two other crew members are awake to man the controls. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Pros and cons of naps </B><BR>
<BR>
The idea of power-napping has also caught on in business, as a brief afternoon
snooze can help to recharge the batteries. According to Folkard, however,
&quot;Naps can be disastrous&quot;. Particularly during the night, waking
up from a nap can take up to an hour, leaving you far more tired than you
were before. Folkard recommends that naps should be limited to 20 or so
minutes and says they are most beneficial in the early afternoon. Beyond
this, sleep becomes deeper and harder to recover from. <BR>
<BR>
Around eight hours after getting up, the body's circadian rhythms reach
a low point, Farney explains: &quot;There is a dip in alertness from about
two to four o'clock, as well as at night, when we want to sleep.&quot; So
the siesta, often thought to be merely an escape from the hottest part of
the afternoon, does have a biological base. The lull also reduces the body's
defences against alcohol, which is why a drink often seems more potent at
lunchtime. But Folkard plays down the significance of this lull: &quot;It's
only a problem if people are in a boring, monotonous situation - then they
may feel drowsy.&quot; He stresses that someone who is stimulated by his
or her work should not notice the afternoon lull. It is significant, however,
that the incidence of road accidents during this period is particularly
high, as bleary-eyed drivers lose concentration. <BR>
<BR>
The cost of sleepiness in both economic and human terms is huge. A recent
calculation by Damien Leger in the sleep unit at the Hotel Dieu hospital
in Paris concluded that 24,318 deaths in the US and nearly 2 million disabling
injuries were caused every year by sleep-related accidents and puts the
economic cost of them at $43.15 billion. Catastrophes such as Three Mile
Island, Chernobyl and the explosion of the space shuttle too have been traced
to mistakes made early in the morning by individuals at the end of long
shifts. So insomnia and other sleep disorders should not be dismissed lightly.
<BR>
<BR>
For those who have trouble sleeping, a number of factors may help. Insomniacs
should avoid exercise just before bed - a stretch in the afternoon is much
less disruptive to circadian rhythms. Also to be avoided are meals late
in the evening: a snack should not affect sleep, but large quantities of
food may do so. Some research has found that foods rich in carbohydrates
can help with sleep, though high-fat food hinders it. Adjusting the room
temperature can also help - a warmer environment is more conducive to sleep.
The ideal temperature is around 16-19&#154;C, or warmer for those who sleep
naked. Folkard points out that hospitals generally keep wards at a constant
temperature, which does not help patients trying to sleep. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Peace of mind is most important </B><BR>
<BR>
As far as noise is concerned, anyone can get used to falling asleep in a
regularly noisy environment but the quality often suffers, as it disrupts
the body's cycle of deep and lighter sleep. <BR>
<BR>
But to Horn all this is irrelevant. &quot;Forget all this mumbo-jumbo,&quot;
he counsels. &quot;The important thing is peace of mind.&quot; Horn suggests
insomniacs should do something distracting before bed: &quot;Feed the cat
or walk round the block&quot;. If after 10 minutes sleep fails to arrive,
leave the room and do something else to take your mind off things. He advises
that the bedroom should be a place of tranquillity, separate from daytime
activity. If possible, work in a different room, do not have a TV in the
bedroom and reserve it for sleep alone. <BR>
<BR>
Gradually, sleep is being recognised as a vital component of a healthy life.
In Britain a campaign has been launched with the message &quot;Sleepiness
can kill&quot;, in response to concerns about over-worked drivers falling
asleep at the wheel. In the US, a recent survey found that 31% of people
feel that sleeplessness has affected how they do their jobs. The survey
was carried out by the Better Sleep Council, an organisation funded by the
mattress industry which hopes to &quot;produce an environment conducive
to sleep&quot;. The survey also found that one in five people had called
in sick or been late for work because of poor sleep. But most employers
are still unsympathetic. Kiley comments: &quot;There is a low level of awareness
about sleep disorders in many segments of society.&quot; Chin Chu Morley
of the Council points out that it is more fashionable to brag &quot;I was
so busy, I only got three hours sleep&quot; than &quot;I slept soundly for
nine hours last night&quot;. <p>

<H3>TIME OUT</H3> 

<H2>Holidays in hell </H2>
<H4>The thrill of political tourism puts pay to the idea that all modern
tourists are sun-soaked ignoramuses </H4>
<I>By Francis Harris </I><BR>
<BR>
Soon after the war began in Bosnia, a Japanese tour party landed at Belgrade
airport and was placed aboard a bus. The driver absentmindedly (and drunkenly)
drove off, paying little attention to the roads or his ultimate destination.
<BR>
<BR>
Some hours later the party was halted at a mountain roadblock. Armed men
approached the vehicle. Where did the driver think he was going, they asked?
&quot;Belgrade&quot;, the man said. Informed that he was about to enter
the besieged city of Sarajevo, then under artillery bombardment, the bus
reversed back up the road with a still-ignorant complement of tourists staring
uncomprehendingly out of the windows. <BR>
<BR>
The story, possibly apocryphal, is said to have caused hilarity in Sarajevo
at the time, not least among Sarajevans then under fire from Serbian positions
in the hills. The idea that something as alien as a busload of tourists
might have almost entered a city at war was absurd. <BR>
<BR>
Yet the political tourist is a distinct and rare species. At his most extreme
he is an irritation to professional observers, a source of suspicion for
the combatants and a menace to himself. Further from the frontline, the
intrepid lone traveller can also be regarded as a source of <BR>
fascination. Julian Borger of the British daily <I>The</I> <I>Guardian</I>
arrived in Dubrovnik last year in anticipation of a Croatian offensive to
drive the Serbs beyond artillery range of the beautiful old Venetian city.
Borger heard a rumour that the city still contained a foreign visitor. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Dubrovnik's tourist,&quot; he wrote, &quot;was proving so elusive
that sceptics were starting to question his existence. A lot of local people
claimed to have spotted him - at the hotel reception, at the travel agency,
in the old town's single functioning caf&eacute; - but on each occasion
he seemed to have vanished into the pale antique stone of the empty streets.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
When Borger finally tracked the solitary tourist down he discovered Matthias
Jung, a 32 year-old Hannover shopkeeper who had decided to see the Balkans
for himself. &quot;You read so much about ex-Yugoslavia, but somehow the
journalists - I don't want to be rude - never give the sense of what a place
is really like.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Some people can't resist taking risks </B><BR>
<BR>
Peter Green, a <I>Newsweek</I> reporter with extensive experience in the
Balkans and central Europe, found others of a similar bent during the siege
of Sarajevo: &quot;There were tourists there during the war. Not that they
called themselves tourists. They didn't wear Reeboks or walk around with
guidebooks in their hands. They tended to be people who got journalistic
accreditation from dubious organisations like rock music magazines or politically
motivated aid groups from the lunatic extremes.&quot; A number were killed,
including two youngsters who ran over a road mine near Mostar in Bosnia.
&quot;Some people just can't resist going to a part of the world everyone's
talking about, whatever the risks.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Whatever questions might be asked about the sanity of these people, they
do give the lie to the idea that all modern tourists are sun-soaked ignoramuses.
For at the end of the 20th century it seems that the only widely available
experience of international travel offers transport in motorised metal boxes
and jet-propelled cigar tubes whooshing victims from one sanitised and banal
architecturally cloned destination to another. In this world, local colour
is limited to the noisy, the incomprehensible and the unthreatening. <BR>
<BR>
Reporters who arrived in Yugoslavia as war erupted in June 1991 remember
the fleeing western tourists whose main thoughts at the beginning of Europe's
nastiest conflict in 50 years were directed at those powers thoughtless
enough to have disturbed their long-planned break. Herr Jung in Dubrovnik
is the exception rather than the rule. <BR>
<BR>
Tourists who find themselves in tricky situations (<I>pace</I> Yugoslavia)
generally choose flight. Denied this option, they are forced to make the
most of it. During one of a series of coups in the Seychelles, with the
airport shut and hotel staff trapped at home by the fighting, western tourists
had to muck-in. An Englishman interviewed by the BBC said the various nationalities
had taken tasks according to inborn ability. The French occupied the kitchens,
the Swiss were running the switchboard and the Germans were in charge of
cleaning. What about the English, the interviewer asked? &quot;Oh we're
overseeing everyone else,&quot; the man said. <BR>
<BR>
The number of people seeking out conflict is limited and as a result, organised
tours for explicitly political holidays are rather uncommon. This is the
antithesis of mass market tourism. But it does exist: it always has. <BR>
<BR>
British schoolboys are taught that the first modern company to develop mass
tourism, Thomas Cook, enlivened early tours to post-siege Paris in 1871
by lighting fires amid the rubble and telling tourists that they were still
smouldering from the conflict. <BR>
<BR>
Thomas Cook's own <I>Excursionist and Tourist Advertiser</I> did not allude
to the fires but acknowledged that its tours to a war-torn city had provoked
complaints in the French National Assembly. A certain Count Joubert seemed
to have suggested Cook's tourists hoped to witness the misery and ruins
of Paris. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It is most satisfactory to find such unfriendly sentiments indignantly
repudiated by M. Jules Favre,&quot; the <I>Advertiser</I> reported in July
1871. &quot;He pointedly told Count Joubert that no one had the right to
give that meaning to the visits of the English people, for those Excursionist
trains had been preceded by enormous trains of provisions for the revictualling
of Paris.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The paper then allowed itself a brief editorial: &quot;We grieve to think
that even men like Count Joubert should misunderstand the feelings which
sway so many of our Tourists. They visit Paris... to make themselves fully
acquainted with the true character and results of recent events. We firmly
believe that such visits are welcome to the Parisians and that they materially
assist the cause of international friendship and peace.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Revisiting this argument at the end of the 20th century is a curious experience.
Mass tourism is now often regarded as a cure-all, a fast-track path to development
for regions like the Middle East where the fruits of peace need to grow
fast. <BR>
<BR>
Israel and the territories it has occupied since the 1967 war have provided
one of the best areas for political tourism. Just before the <I>intifada</I>
began in the mid-80s, a firm called Diplomatic Services organised tours
to peer under the surface of everyday life, with an itinerary including
meetings with Arab politicians and journalists in Bethlehem, Jewish settlers
on the West Bank and security officials. Other trips included a view of
Jerusalem and its problems and a trip to the frontiers with Syria and Lebanon.
Of course the trips were rather one-sided, being run by an Israeli company.
<BR>
<BR>
South Africa too has spawned its fair share of political tours since the
introduction of multiracial rule. Alec Russell, a <I>Daily Telegraph</I>
reporter, joined a party of white foreigners heading for Soweto. &quot;No
one would admit to being worried... but as our minibus wound through downtown
Johannesburg, conversation grew stilted,&quot; he wrote. <BR>
<BR>
The travel firm, Jimmy's Face to Face Tours, takes parties around the township.
Although much time is spent on the bus, they are taken into a corrugated
iron drinking shack known by the Gaelic name <I>shebeen</I> and given Castle
lager. Most time in the field is spent in Soweto's wealthy areas, perhaps
because of an occasion when a bus was held up. That time, Russell told <I>World
Link</I>, the tourists only avoided robbery because the driver persuaded
the thief to leave without booty. The drive ends back at one of Johannesburg's
ritzier hotels as the tourists heave a sigh of relief. The tour is usually
judged a success. <BR>
<BR>
<B>No one admitted to being worried </B><BR>
<BR>
Bus tours through the battlefields of recent conflicts have also proved
popular in the northern hemisphere. Ulsterbus has used the ceasefire to
run regular tours past the unofficial war memorials and murals of Catholic
west Belfast and the Protestant east: the Bobby Sands mural and the loyalists
Freedom Corner are among the sights. <BR>
<BR>
A different type of visit is available in the towns of northern Pakistan
and the Russian Far East, where tourists can now spend time in the company
of the once-feared Red Army. According to a local English-language paper,
<I>The Vladivostock News</I>, soldiers offer tourists a range of weapon
practice at a price, including $60 to fire a rocket-propelled grenade, $18
for a clip of pistol ammunition and $1,440 for the joy of firing an anti-tank
missile. The trade is clearly lucrative for the troops, who reportedly gave
false names. <BR>
<BR>
Sadly, political tourism is likely to remain a minority pursuit. Life may
become ever more anodyne, but that seems merely to make most people more
cautious. Like the bus driver at Belgrade airport, most tourists are likely
to confront the world of bloody reality through accident rather than design.

<H3>BACKSEAT</H3>
<H4>Charles Darwent on why elephant 'planes, Bum crisps and Pschitt soda
don't have global appeal </H4>
Though it causes me a certain embarrassment to admit it, I have just spent
several minutes laughing helplessly at an empty packet of Spanish potato
crisps. It was not the emptiness of the packet that caused this mirth, nor
yet its Iberian origins. No, the object's amusement value lay in the brand
name emblazoned in large, yellow letters: the single, sonorous word, <I>&#161;Bum!</I>.
<BR>
<BR>
To non-Spanish speakers among you, &quot;bum&quot; is an onomatopoeia most
equivalent in force to the English word &quot;bang&quot;. The mystery of
why anybody should want to name a potato crisp Bang may be explained by
the circumstances under which the packet in question came to be transformed
into the desirable collectors' item it now is. <BR>
<BR>
By chance, the outgoing prime minister of Sweden chose to pass his holidays
this summer in the very same Spanish village to which Backseat's bronzed
stormtroopers had repaired. Whenever the unfortunate premier and his jittery
entourage attempted to stroll past the local bar in unconvincing incognito,
naughty Spanish youths inflated these crisp packets and burst them with
a report as of small arms fire. I do not know what &quot;bum&quot; means
in Swedish, but the effect on Ingvar Carlsson and his security men was clearly
distressing whatever it may be. <BR>
<BR>
It is presumably not the explosive quality of its packaging that has prevented
<I>&#161;Bum!</I> from taking the lucrative markets of the Anglophone world
by storm, however. Along with a Dutch coffee called &quot;Bonker&quot; and
a French soft drink with the memorable name of &quot;Pschitt&quot; - all
borne triumphantly home from foreign holidays past - the Spanish savoury
snack provides an object lesson in the corporate dangers of multilingualism.
When Our Lord punished the people of Babel for their unfortunate taste in
skyscraper-building, He would seem to have had His eye fixed most vengefully
not (as might have seemed logical) on the city's architects, but on its
marketing men. <BR>
<BR>
It is a curse from which even the greatest of their descendants are still
not immune. When, in the early '60s, the makers of a very famous British
motor car indeed chose to christen their latest marque the Silver Mist,
sales figures in Germany plummeted overnight to nil. Troubled executives
were at a loss to explain this unhappy phenomenon until a local agent gently
pointed out that <I>Mist</I> is the German word for dog ordure. Perhaps
understandably, well-heeled Berliners - already bewildered by having a visiting
American president tell them they should be proud to be doughnuts - found
the attractions of being chauffeured around in a vehicle apparently named
for an excretory function of the canine body all too easy to pass up. The
car's German name was swiftly - if expensively - changed. <BR>
<BR>
You might think that the world of automotive branding would have taken a
long, hard look at this baptismal <I>grand guignol</I> and mended its ways
accordingly. But no. Consider, if you will, the names chosen by Japanese
car manufacturers for their export products. <BR>
<BR>
It may be that the word &quot;Civic&quot;, say, suggests all sorts of desirable
qualities to the socially minded Tokyo motorist such as courtesy and immunity
from the fashionable road rage that seems to grip his Occidental brother.
When preceded by the word &quot;Honda&quot;, however, it hardly seems likely
to set the automotive pulses racing in quite the way that &quot;Testarossa&quot;
or &quot;Thunderbird&quot; might have done. &quot;Cherry&quot; (as in Nissan)
also appears a touch lacking in that hormonal belly-fire that allegedly
sells cars in the west, even if its suggestion of trembling blossom is intended
to call the haiku of Kobayashi Issa to the presumably more poetic mind of
the Japanese motorist. <BR>
<BR>
The only other possible explanation for the branding policy of Japan's car
manufacturers is that they sit around boardroom tables in Greater Okinawa
jabbing randomly at the pages of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary with
a pin. If so, then we may in time presumably expect to see the Toyota Zeugma
and Datsun Nappy taking triumphantly to the road. <BR>
<BR>
Quite how this linguistic minefield is to be navigated is a matter for sober
thought. The admirably polyglot Emperor Charles V may have remarked that
he spoke Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men and German to horses:
but what would he have spoken to his marketing department? <BR>
<BR>
The sad fact is that some languages are simply better for saying certain
things than are others: a truth whose eternal verity is borne out by the
unhappy attempts of the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise to cleanse perfidious
anglicisms from everyday French. The jauntiness of English makes it good
at coming up with catchy names like &quot;jumbo jet&quot;. The Acad&eacute;mie's
alternative francophone offering - <I>l'avion &eacute;l&eacute;phantin </I>-
may have literality on its side but would you stand under one? <BR>
<BR>
There have, of course, been numerous attempts to reverse the one-nil score
at Babel by creating a universal language, most notably in the 120-year-old
form of Ludwik Zamenhof's Esperanto. That this renders the phrase &quot;I
love you&quot; as <I>mi amas vin</I> may go some way to explaining its abiding
lack of popularity with marketing departments, however. <BR>
<BR>
Understandably enough, therefore, new software programs that promise to
translate one's native tongue into nasty foreign languages at the press
of a button have recently been fallen upon by monoglot marketeers with brimming
tears of gratitude. <BR>
<BR>
They may be in for disappointment. A lexicographer friend tells me that
an Anglo-French example with which she was recently toying happily translated
Elizabeth I's &quot;the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak&quot; as
<I>l'alcool</I> <I>est sain mais la viande est faible</I>. When commanded
to retranslate this phrase back into English, the program scratched its
electromagnetic head for a minute and then smilingly proffered &quot;the
booze is serviceable but the meat is flavourless&quot;. What it might have
done to potato crisps does not bear musing over in the pages of a respectable
magazine. <p>

<H3>WHO'S WHO IN EAST AND CENTRAL EUROPE </H3>
<H4>The revolutions in east and central Europe have cleared the way for a new
generation of business people. It is a community that ranges from high-&thorn;iers
too young to remember communism, grabbing their chance, to former Marxists
who have jettisoned their previous ideology in the race to make money and
in&thorn;uence people. Margie Lindsay and Craig Mellow have picked 58 leading
&THORN;gures in 13 countries across the region, a guide to those who have
reached the top and those who plan to join them there </H4>

<H3>ALBANIA </H3>
<H4>PRESIDENT </H4>

Sali Berisha <BR>
<BR>
Ordered to halt anti-communist demonstrations during December 1990, Berisha
joined the protesters and soon after co-founded the Democratic Party (DP)
Albania's first legal independent political entity since 1946. As DP leader
during nationwide general strikes that brought down the last communist government,
he led the party to victory in the March 1992 elections, when it took 63%
of the vote. But this year's poll came under a cloud, with accusations by
some foreign observers of massive ballot-rigging and intimidation by Berisha's
men. Having jailed both his predecessor as president and the head of the
main opposition Socialist Party, Berisha has come under international pressure
for his authoritarian style. <BR>

<BR>
<I>Fax +355 42 337 61</I> <BR>

<H4>GOVERNOR OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF ALBANIA </H4>

Kristaq Luniku <BR>
<BR>
Luniku, who read economics and finance at Tirana University, took up the
post at the head of the central bank last year at the age of 34. Probably
the country's most able banking specialist since World War II, Luniku oversaw
the dismantling of the communist era's National Bank of Albania and the
subsequent creation of a central bank and three independent commercial banks.
Luniku has worked closely with the World Bank. He also heads the stock exchange.

<H4>ECONOMIST </H4>

Gramoz Josef Pashko <BR>
<BR>
Pashko, a former deputy prime minister and Albania's leading economist,
is the eponymous son of one of Albania's most famous communist leaders.
He received a doctorate in economics at Tirana University where he later
lectured and became one of the most radical supporters of economic reform
under the last communist regime. A co-founder of the Democratic Party, he
was deputy prime minister and finance minister in the 1991 coalition. Re-elected
as a DP MP in March 1992, he later broke with Berisha and became a leader
of the Democratic Alliance party. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Tel/Fax +355 42 323 50</I> <BR>

<H4>MANAGING DIRECTOR OF ADA </H4>

Marsel Skendo <BR>
<BR>
Skendo was Albania's first millionaire businessman. He is managing director
of ADA, the Albanian-French holding company and airline operator, which
has a range of import-export activities. Skendo became one of the most celebrated
prisoners of the post-communist government after being held on remand for
most of 1994 on charges widely regarded as spurious before &THORN;nally
being cleared. Some suggest that his real offence was refusing to pay a
&quot;political levy&quot; to the ruling DP. <BR>

<H4>CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE ALBANIAN STOCK EXCHANGE </H4>

Albina Karamitro <BR>
<BR>
Karamitro is considered one of the country's brightest and most capable
financiers. Unfortunately, the exchange has no stocks to trade yet: just
government treasury bills and securities. Karamitro is one of the few women
in a position of power in post-communist Albania. <BR>

<BR>
<H3>THE BALTIC STATES </H3>
<H4>PRESIDENT OF HANSABANK </H4>

Hannes Tamj&auml;rv <BR>
<BR>
Exploiting the liberalisation of the final years of the Soviet Union, Tamj&auml;rv
began a small furniture-making enterprise in Estonia. He moved on to create
Hansabank, which quickly became the country's biggest commercial bank. Although
small when compared with its western counterparts, Hansabank is one of the
most successful large companies in the Baltics with interests in the country's
second-biggest commercial bank and a number of other businesses. Tamj&auml;rv,
who holds right-wing political views, has a large influence on Estonia's
economy and economic policy through his ties with the Reform Party/Liberals,
sometimes dubbed the Hansabank Party. He is now expanding operations to
the other two Baltic countries. <BR>

<H4>DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF ACHEMA  JOINT-STOCK COMPANY </H4>

Bronislovas Lubys <BR>
<BR>
Lubys, 58, is one of Lithuania's wealthiest men with power to match in industry
and politics. His career began at the Azotas nitrogen fertiliser plant,
where he worked as a chief engineer and then director-general. When the
plant was privatised, reorganised and renamed Achema, Lubys also became
an owner. In 1992 he was appointed vice-premier and then prime minister.
As premier, Lubys secured changes in the privatisation law and preferential
rights for company employees to buy shares. After the first presidential
election, he returned to Achema. Now he defends business interests as the
president of the Industrialists' Confederation. <BR>

<H4>GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF LITHUANIA </H4>

Reinoldijus Sarkinas <BR>
<BR>
Sarkinas, 50, was elected head of the Lithuanian central bank in February.
Before that he had served for two years as minister of finance, capping
a 16-year career in the ministry. In political circles Sarkinas has been
praised for his competence, reserved manner and independence. Considered
one of the country's best financial minds, he arrived at the central bank
just after the country's two major commercial banks had closed. Most of
the blame was attributed to Sarkinas's predecessor and the then Lithuanian
premier. But he has been attacked more than once, both for the banking crisis
and an &quot;anti-business&quot; taxation system. <BR>

<H4>MAYOR OF VENTSPILS </H4>

Aivars Lembergs <BR>
<BR>
Ventspils is Latvia's third-largest city and home to the largest cargo port
in the Baltics. Lembergs, who has been mayor since 1994, is also chairman
of the port board. Lembergs wants to attract local and foreign investment
to modernise the port, although he opposes foreign ownership of transit
enterprises. Instead, he wants to raise money by making the companies public.
Lembergs held a number of senior positions in the Ventspils administration
during the Soviet era and was a member of the Latvian parliament in 1990-1993.

Endel Siff <BR>
<BR>
Dubbed an &quot;Oil king of Estonia&quot; and said be one of the richest
people in the country, Endel Siff runs the biggest private oil company in
the Baltics. His company, N-Terminaal, ships Russian oil through Estonia
to western ports. Siff is one of the three main shareholders of N-Terminaal,
which had a $35 million turnover last year. This performance earned Siff
almost $1 million in dividends. Educated as a mechanical engineer, he had
a quiet career during the Soviet era. In 1988 he joined the successful state-owned
trading company Estimpex, where he learned the international oil trade.
When Estonia regained its independence in 1991 he launched the firm, which
quickly and quietly became the biggest private oil company of Estonia. Siff
makes few appearances in public. His company's main interest seems to be
to achieve and maintain good Estonian-Russian relations, an elusive goal
since independence. <BR>

<BR>
A journalist by education, Kargin graduated from the Latvian State University
and during the Soviet times led a number of Komsomol (Young Communist) organisations
in Riga. With the advent of Mikhail Gorbachev's <I>perestroika</I> Kargin
founded a number of businesses, ranging from a tourist agency to a network
of currency exchange offices. The success of the latter laid the basis for
the creation of Parex bank in 1992. Parex gradually developed from a medium-sized
company to one of the two leading banks in Latvia, although it is still
small by western standards. Last year the bank had equity capital of about
$28 million, assets of $205 million and a profit of $14 million. It is strongly
geared towards the markets of the former Soviet Union, attracting money
from Russia as well as press allegations of money-laundering: the bank's
television advertisement in Russia featured a boy bringing his piggybank
to the counter with the slogan, &quot;We won't tell even your mother&quot;.
Kargin is deeply involved in Latvian politics and has provided financial
support to all the main political forces in the country, although he has
particularly strong ties with the governing Saimnieks party. <BR>

In 1992 this mercurial former Communist Party member presented a plan to
privatise and rescue Skoda, a large state-owned engineering company making
locomotives, machine tools and both conventional and nuclear power stations.
His private company Nero took a 20% stake in the enterprise. Under Soudek
the firm has returned to profitability and the company's reach now makes
Soudek probably the country's most influential industrialist. Fluent in
Russian, he is a workaholic, a teetotaller, rich (his stake in Skoda is
worth about $200 million) and controversial. In 1993 he tried to sell Skoda
nuclear technology to Iran, until western diplomatic pressure halted the
sale. A year later he was reported to be at it again, apparently trying
to export to Iran via Russia. <BR>

<H4>FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, HARVARD CAPITAL &amp; CONSULTING </H4>

Viktor Kozeny <BR>
<BR>
In 1991 Kozeny, then aged 27, left the US to return to his native Prague.
He set up Harvard Capital &amp; Consulting and within a year he claims to
have turned his $3,000 investment into $3 million. In 1992, he established
the Harvard group of investment funds. It attracted vouchers under the government's
privatisation scheme, which allowed Kozeny to acquire large stakes in 51
leading Czech and Slovak enterprises, including several big banks. At its
peak, Harvard managed about $1 billion of Czech and Slovak assets. A controversial
figure from the outset, the mystery that surrounds Kozeny deepened in 1993
when secret service agent Vaclav Wallis alleged he had paid him to supply
Harvard with classified commercial information. Kozeny went to the then
interior minister, Petr Cermak, claiming that Wallis was blackmailing him.
Wallis was given a 37-month prison sentence. After testifying at the trial,
Kozeny moved to the Bahamas. Wallis was later freed on appeal. Cermak, an
adviser to the Czech prime minister Vaclav Klaus, has since been hired by
Harvard. Meanwhile Harvard formed an alliance with Michael Dingman, a member
of the board of the Ford motor company and former president of Allied-Signal,
the US industrial conglomerate. Stratton Investments, Dingman's private
company, last year teamed up with Harvard and reportedly paid $250 million
for large, in many cases controlling, stakes in eight big Czech companies.

1975, in the hardline comunist days of &quot;normalisation&quot;, he became
a director of Chemapol, the Czech Republic's monopoly importer of Russian
oil and a holding company with large stakes in scores of chemical and pharmaceutical
firms. Since 1992, when voucher privatisation dismantled the country's chemical
and oil industry monopolies, Chemapol has aggressively sought to consolidate
these sectors and it has spent at least $250 million on acquisitions over
the past year. This year the company plans to sell more than $30 million
of stock via the London Stock Exchange. Junek came into the public eye two
years ago, when Chemapol bid unsuccessfully for a 49% stake in the Czech
Republic's two main oil refineries. <BR>

Frustrated by the corporate culture, he left the investment bank in December
1993, taking a handful of colleagues with him. In May 1994 he opened Patria,
the Czech Republic's first home-grown full-service investment banking company.
The company claims to have cornered 20% of trade on the Prague bourse and
is now a leading issuer and dealer of Czech corporate bonds. Patria's corporate
research is held in high regard and its macroeconomic research on the Czech
economy takes a piercing, often critical, look at the state's finances.
Bakala is also a board member of the Prague Stock Exchange. With his wife,
he part-owns several of Prague's swankier restaurants. <BR>

However, his apolitical stance appears to have cost him public office. When
he took the helm at Hitel Bank in March last year, his first move was to

Probably the best-known figure in the country's financial community, Bokros
resigned as finance minister in March.<B> </B>With a background in investment
banking which included a spell in London, Bokros is revered by international
investors. He is a former head of Budapest Bank and a founder of the stock
exchange. He was the first finance minister to attack the social security
system and stimulate growth by raising import duties and devaluing the forint.
These austerity policies made him few friends among the electorate. Despite
his domestic unpopularity, Bokros tried to stay true to his policies. He
was not helped in this task by a severe lack of tact - journalists
described him as brusque and arrogant - and his refusal to explain
his actions to the public generated suspicion. Bokros is out of the limelight
but he is still considered influential. He will likely resurface, probably
in a western investment bank. <BR>

and determination to succeed, he began to build an industrial conglomerate
around the old state core functions. Skowronski, who represented Elektrim
in Moscow in the '80s and holds a doctorate in economics, has taken the
company into new fields such as food processing, real estate and hotels
and most recently as part of PTK, a mobile telephone operating company.

strategic investor in Bank Gdanski, which is twice as large as Bank IG.
Like many of Poland's leading businessmen, he attended the foreign trade
faculty at Warsaw's Central Planning School and the finance ministry in
the '80s. Bank IG itself was conceived by a group of reforming government
officials. Originally financed with support from state-owned insurance companies

Dubbed the Donald Trump of Bucharest, this sombre 58-year-old is possibly
the most powerful man in Romania and almost certainly the richest. He says
his experience abroad in the '70s and as an import-export director in the
Romanian ministry of finance helped him exploit the financial chaos that
followed the 1989 fall of communism. His company GC&amp;P, a holding operation
for countless business interests, recorded a turnover last year well in
excess of $1 billion, a figure that does not include &quot;indirect interests&quot;.
This year alone, he has paid $10 million outright for 31% of Romania's largest
private bank, bought aircraft worth $425 million from Canada and unveiled
plans to build eastern Europe's tallest building in the heart of Bucharest
at a cost of more than $100 million. Paunescu's acquisition last summer
of the Bucharest Intercontinental Hotel with a bid substantially lower than
rival group Marriott International is being investigated for possible fraud.

<H4>PRESIDENT OF UNEXIM BANK </H4>

Vladimir Potanin <BR>
<BR>
Although it opened only three years ago, the United Export-Import Bank (ONEKSIM
Bank in Russian) has become Russia's third biggest house. Potanin and his
team used the old system to reach the top: capital came from hard-currency
industrial exporters and the core of the management team from the defunct
Soviet Vneshekonombank. Potanin, who spent most of the '80s in the foreign
trade ministry, employed an aggressive style that quickly made the bank
into a powerhouse. UNEXIM Bank masterminded the &quot;loans-for-shares&quot;
scheme, under which the state dumped controlling packets of blue-chip enterprises
into the laps of Russian banks for nominal sums late last year. The scheme
was aborted under a cloud of scandal but UNEXIM kept hold of its prizes.

<H4>CHAIRMAN OF BANK MENATEP </H4>

Mikhail Khodorkovsky <BR>
<BR>
Khodorkovsky was once a college Communist Youth League chairman, but he
joined the business opposition before it became fashionable He formed MENATEP
between 1987-88. As communist power collapsed, the bank pioneered one essential
business practice after another including public stock offerings, television
advertising and foreign exchange bureaux. The MENATEP image, which still
survives, was slick and mysterious. Khodorkovsky saw sooner than others
that &quot;We cannot make miracles without the state.&quot; MENATEP was
the first brat-pack bank to crack the lucrative circle of certified financial
intermediaries for government investment programmes. Khodorkovsky also got
on well with post-Soviet industry, particularly in energy. <BR>

<H4>PRESIDENT OF MOST-BANK </H4>

Vladimir Goussinsky <BR>
<BR>
Goussinsky's last job was as a theatrical director, something that may have
come to mind when his bank security team was raided by masked thugs who
later turned out to be Kremlin guards commanded by Boris Yeltsin's confidante
Alexander Korzhakov. Some people attributed the raid to a shadowy dispute
between the Kremlin and Moscow's Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who is closely associated
with the bank. Goussinky's team is adept at playing the bond and currency
markets and issuing credit cards. However, most suspect that Luzhkov, who
once reportedly had most of the capital's revenues on deposit at Most-Bank,
is the real source of success. Goussinsky retreated to London after the
December 1994 attack and Luzhkov curbed his criticism of federal authorities.
Luzhkov is likely to progress further up the political ladder, while Goussinsky
has resurfaced as Russia's top press baron as a result of Most-Bank's media
holdings. <BR>

<H4>GENERAL DIRECTOR OF LUKOIL </H4>

Vagit Alekperov <BR>
<BR>
Kogalym, in the north-west Siberian oil country, is an unlikely site for
a major multinational corporation. However, after Alekperov arrived in 1983
as a brash administrative <I>wunderkind</I>, its production figures began
to rival those at the huge wells at Surgut and Nizhnyvartovsk. About six
years ago, Alekperov formed what was then &quot;Concern&quot; Lukoil. His
partner in the venture was another dynamic young director, Yuri Shafranik,
who two years later became Russia's energy minister. Lukoil's relations
with foreign partners are littered with recriminations and the occasional
lawsuit. The firm's efforts at muscling-in on international consortia in
Azerbaijan was ham-fisted. However, Alekperov is still well ahead of the
Siberian pack, even though he has yet to make Lukoil work any better. This
may explain the so-so performance of company securities. <BR>

<H4>GENERAL DIRECTOR OF NOVOSHIP </H4>

Leonid Loza <BR>
<BR>
From a motley collection of ageing vessels in the Black Sea port of Novorossysk,
Loza has quickly forged a world-class shipping line for oil and general
freight. In 1992, Loza hired Coopers &amp; Lybrand to do the books and he
sent his captains to study at British and American marine academies. Last
year Novoship became the first non resource-based Russian industrial company
to tap international financial markets in a big way, with an EBRD-backed
loan of $336 million to finance the purchase of 11 new supertankers. Novorossysk,
a third-string port in Soviet times, is the most logical outlet for oil
soon to come from the Caspian Sea fields of Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. <BR>

Kakha Bendukidze <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We had one guiding principal,&quot; says one of Kakha Bendukidze's
lieutenants, &quot;to buy as much as possible.&quot; While the big banks
scoffed at Russia's convoluted voucher auctions, this reclusive former microbiologist
leveraged a modest export-import based fortune into an industrial empire,
at least on paper. In 1994, Bendukidze caused a stir when he bought 22%
of the huge industrial firm Uralmash for $500,000. But his investments in
the western Siberian oil and gas belt may be more fruitful in the long run.
Pouncing on the voucher privatisation scheme, Bendukidze and insiders from
the Russian Oil Exchange bought into about 50 oil support organisations,
concentrating on the arctic gas-producing region. Like other Russian raiders,
NIPEK lacks resources to develop the properties it grabbed. However, when
multinational capital finally gets serious about Russia, it will surely
be more serious about western Siberia than it will be about anywhere else.

<H4>GENERAL DIRECTOR OF VIDEO INTERNATIONAL </H4>

Dmitry Abroschenko <BR>
<BR>
After two years of running Russian operations for US advertising giant Young
&amp; Rubicam, Abroschenko, 31, thought he could do better on his own. Video
International, founded to sell time on Russian television, has become a
fully fledged ad agency whose creative work stands up to that of Madison
Avenue. It dominates the billings of big Russian advertisers such as Most-Bank
and Bank Imperial. It is also raking in business from the Russian ads of
multinational firms like Procter &amp; Gamble, Kodak and Sony. This year
Video International landed the biggest account of all, Boris Yeltsin's re-election
campaign. If the agency's &quot;I believe, I love, I hope&quot; slogan is
felt to have helped Yeltsin win, it could represent a quantum leap for Russia's
rising image-maker. <BR>

It was Karachinsky who helped provide the computer services for Russia's
growing financial services industry. Karachinsky learned his trade by computerising
railway timetables in the early '80s and he published a book about personal
computers in 1986, years before any existed in the Soviet Union. After forming
IBS in 1992, he promptly closed deals with Dell, Lotus, 3-Com and other
hardware and software stars. Thus armed, he set out to network the dynamic
young banks. Karachinsky's colleagues in the DATOR industry association
have named him the most influential figure in Russian high technology for
three years in a row. <BR>

The king of Russian consumer product distribution is an economist who started
his business career with a shopping trip to Germany in 1991. A year or two
later, Podolsky talked Mars Corporation into a distribution deal. The Centaur
Finance and Industrial Group was on its way. Centaur shoulders the burden
of Russian customs and shipping for multinational clients. It then sends
products to the vast interior from its 30 cash-and-carry warehouse stores
in Moscow. The firm itself does not brave Russia's bandit-infested highways,
contracting the work to others. &quot;If we did business only with people
we trust entirely, we would have one or two partners,&quot; Podolsky asserts.
&quot;But in fact we have 300 or 400.&quot; Podolsky thinks the most common
mistake of western companies in Russia is that they &quot;treat us like
some kind of colonial market. Firms pay their Russian manager $300 a month,
and then wonder why he steals from them.&quot; <BR>

in 1983 and went straight to a plum post in the finance ministry's foreign
currency division. On a 1988 trip to monitor Soviet assets in Belgium, Ugolnikov
met some adventurous partners from the firm then called Touche-Ross. After
a two-year struggle, he talked his superiors into launching a joint venture
with them. The result was Inaudit, the first Soviet auditing firm, which
opened in 1990. Today Ugolnikov oversees more than 700 Deloitte &amp; Touche
employees throughout the Commonwealth of Independent States. <BR>

Russia's window on the east was in sorry shape before Zhebelev hatched the
idea of turning the seaside town of Nakhodka, just east of Vladivostok,
into a free economic zone. He attracted some serious investors including
America's Sea-Land Corp and P&amp;O Australia, to turn his backwater into
a contemporary container port fit to handle the growing trade with Japan
and Korea. More growth at Vostochny is hostage to events beyond Zhebelev's
control - the settling of Russia's dispute with Japan over the Kuril
Islands and the progress of mammoth oil projects near Sakhalin Island. <BR>

<H4>CHAIRMAN OF NORILSK NICKEL </H4>

Vsevolod Generalov <BR>
<BR>
The colossal mining centre at Norilsk presents one of the world's tougher
management challenges. Despite churning out 20% of global nickel production
and much else besides, Norilsk Nickel is floundering under the weight of
amateurish financial management and the cost of keeping a medium-sized city
running north of the Arctic Circle. When UNEXIM Bank acquired 51% last year,
management and workers were none-too-welcoming. Generalov was brought in
as a caretaker with unquestionably good credentials. After 16 years of dues-paying
at Kazakhstan's Ust-Kamenogorsk lead works he began to climb the administrative
ladder, alighting as deputy chairman of the powerful Russian State Metals
Committee. Yet Generalov has shown little sympathy for his fellow old boys,
quickly dispatching Norilsk Nickel's incumbent director in favour of an
UNEXIM Bank official. &quot;The company's basic problems are rooted in the
complete absence of an effective system of management,&quot; he declares.
In Russian apparatese, this is likely to translate as &quot;more heads will
roll&quot;. <BR>

Vladimir Masar <BR>

Masar, 38, is one of the world's youngest central bank governors. After
a career that took him from the old Czechoslovak State Bank into private
banking and subsequently into government as Slovakia's state finance secretary,
Masar was appointed to his post in July 1993 by prime minister Vladimir
Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. Masar has proved his independence
and professionalism by enforcing impressive monetary and fiscal discipline.
As Jaromir Cekota, Slovakia's resident representative of the EBRD once said,
Masar has overseen &quot;the most impressive fiscal turnaround anywhere
in eastern Europe&quot;. With his penchant for flashy attire, Masar has
a reputation as a bit of a ladies' man. His next challenge is to ensure
that Slovakia's banking system, laden with more than $3 billion of non-performing
loans, does not crack as the government tries to complete the privatisation
of the country's largest institutions. <BR>

Julius Toth <BR>
<BR>
A former finance minister under prime minister Meciar, Toth is a force to
be reckoned with among Slovakia's economic and political elite. As a director
of VSZ steel works in Kosice, which earns 30% of Slovakia's export revenues,
he took part in the controversial 1994 management purchase of VSZ stock
just days before the collapse of Meciar's second coalition government. With
fellow directors he formed a private company, Manager, to buy a 9.53% stake
for only $10 million when the market value was a reported $50 million. This
purchase was financed partly by the Industrial Bank of Kosice, Slovakia's
fifth biggest bank, of which Toth is a board member. Toth declined a government
position when Meciar was re-elected in 1994, but he is still a member of
Meciar's ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and he is said
to be a generous contributor to the party. In January Toth was appointed
head of DMD Holdings, a government-owned company that is charged with restructuring
Slovakia's arms industry. The company has taken a 34% stake in all Slovak
arms manufacturers. <BR>

Resez, 48, is one of Slovakia's richest men. A member of Vladimir Meciar's
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, Resez entered the government in the
autumn of 1994. His ministry is responsible for the country's infrastructure
and for civil engineering projects including the soon-to-be partially privatised
state telephone monopoly. As vice-president of VSZ, Resez was a founding
member of Manager (see Toth above). He also has an interest in metals import-export
company Ferrimex, which has a 15% stake in VSZ, and in Cassoviainvest, an
investment company that also holds 15% of VSZ. Through its VSZ interests,
which has stakes in scores of Slovak companies and in more than 40 Czech
enterprises, the Resez family has considerable industrial punch. Resez senior,
together with VSZ directors, last year reportedly acquired a 12% stake in
Harvard Capital &amp; Consulting (Slovakia). Resez is a football fan; he
is an owner of the Kosice football club and a part-owner of Sparta Praha.

strong demand for his services, providing Ukraine's under-productive farms
with seeds, fertiliser and equipment as well as marketing their crop. He
has been through the nine circles of bureaucratic hell, however, trying
to build a $15 million state-of-the-art agro-processing centre in Myronivka,
a town south of Kiev. However, arm-twisting from both the EBRD and US agriculture
department, which are investors in the project, persuaded the local oligarchy
to reinstate the cancelled construction permits and the centre should be
completed this year. <BR>

The firm is providing inputs or buying crops on 300,000 more hectares, or

18 years in the economics department of the Ukrainian Institute of Land
Management before starting Agroinkom in 1991. Perennially short of capital,
he works through a web of barter agreements throughout the CIS, Europe and
north America. Lobas is diplomatic about his bruising encounters with local

Vladimir Scherban <BR>

The most important figure in Ukrainian business is not a businessman at
all, but an extraordinary public official. Donetsk is supposed to be Ukraine's
bleeding sore, a concentration of outdated Soviet heavy industry piggy-backed
on exhausted 19th-century coal mines. Moreover, the province is Russian-speaking
and its miners the most politically organised of all CIS workers. Yet Scherban's
leadership has produced what World Bank representative Daniel Kauffman ecstatically
calls &quot;Donetsk, Inc&quot;, a heavy exporter of entrepreneurial zest
to the sleepy western Ukraine. In a land where most politicians are the
products of string-pulling and party ticket-punching, Scherban is conspicuously
self-made. He left school at 17 to work as a plumber, rising painstakingly
to become an enterprise manager in the food-processing industry and picking
up a higher education on the way. He has set loose a Jacobin tide against
his former colleagues, enforcing workers' usually ignored right to vote
their bosses out of office. Some 400 general directors have been sent packing
as a result. He also organised Ukraine's most aggressive small privatisation
programme. <BR>

The politicians in Kiev continue to dither over their commitment to privatisation,
but that does not bother Maksmudov. Armed with modest capital of $2.4 million,
this former computer science professor now has a controlling or strategic
stake in a dozen factories making everything from rope to macaroni. Dicom's
emphasis is on consumer and light industrial producers, whose productivity
it can, in theory, raise without heavy capital inputs. The firm's holdings
should expand as voucher privatisation kicks into high gear this winter.

<H3>THE TOP 100 COMPANIES IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE </H3>
<H4>Jana Hamel on a survey that pinpoints the region's frontrunners<BR><BR>
In the move from centrally directed to market economies in central and eastern
Europe, the region's largest companies are playing a crucial role. Predictably
enough in a rebuilding market, where infrastructure or support industries
fuel the economy, these tend to be energy and utilities companies. The following
list of the region's top 100 companies, compiled by Deloitte &amp; Touche
Central Europe, attempts to provide an overview of the region's success
stories.</H4> <BR>

The search for foreign<B> </B>direct investors has been a driving force
in the reorganisation of companies and in more general legal and economic
change. Progress has generally been fastest in the more economically developed
&quot;Visegrad four&quot; countries and Slovenia. The exception is Slovakia,
where foreign investment has been somewhat discouraged by political turmoil,
leaving domestic investors as the backbone of the privatisation process.
<BR>
<BR>
As the region and its companies develop, the focus will shift from restructuring
companies to helping them compete in world markets. <BR>
<BR>
Among the Visegrad countries, manufacturing and heavy industry lead the
economies of the Czech Republic and Poland, supporting a large number of
utilities and other companies servicing the infrastructure. In Hungary,
one of the region's largest economies, banks form an important part of the
country's economy but fall outside the scope of the ranking. Oil and gas,
utilities and light industry also play key roles. Slovenia, ahead of the
rest in terms of investment, continues to be strong in pharmaceuticals and
light industry. <BR>
<BR>
In second-tier countries such as Romania and the former Yugoslavia, large
state-run companies are still dominant. The private sector has very little
depth. A few entries, mainly in the oil and gas sector, illustrate the varying
progress towards privatisation and investment in these countries. In Bulgaria,
currently going through some political upheaval, the imminent sale of state
enterprises should help in recovery. <BR>
<BR>
The Baltic states of Lithuania and Latvia are lagging behind, mainly because
of recent banking crises, and Estonia had little to contribute to this ranking.
This region is returning to its traditional emphasis on light industry,
trading and wood working after having Soviet-style industrialisation thrust
upon it. <BR>
<BR>
When reading the list of the region's top 100 companies, several constraints
should be kept in mind. First, the list is in &thorn;ux: the &THORN;scal
year is identical to the calendar year for all companies in central Europe
and data for 1995 is available only in very few cases. The most recent reliable
data for year-end 1994 was used as the standard to allow comparison. <BR>
<BR>
Another consideration is that many countries have a shadow economy made
up of small private companies with revenues not large enough to enter the
top 100 classi&THORN;cation but which make up a signi&THORN;cant portion
of GDP. <BR>
<BR>
Most importantly, it has been difficult to get accurate &THORN;nancial data
from former Communist bloc companies. Our information is limited to revenue
statements - translated into US dollars, based on a historic exchange
rate - as there is still no legal requirement to provide a cash-&thorn;ow
statement. But one also wants to ask about a company's gearing, number of
employees, level of accounts receivable compared with revenue, level of
minority interest and dependence on one customer or product. <BR>
<BR>
Reliable data is becoming easier to gather. Although it may not be possible
to answer all questions yet, in future rankings we will look at a company's
assets and pro&THORN;tability as well as revenues to give a better overall
picture. <BR>
<BR>
A further difficulty is in &THORN;nding a way to rate companies whose &THORN;gures
are gathered, calculated and evaluated differently. Indeed, the very need
for independent assessment of a company's &THORN;nancial condition in an
internationally acceptable form has fuelled the tremendous growth of the
Big Six audit &THORN;rms in the region. However, some of the assessments
referred to have been more limited statutory audits rather than those performed
to international standards, causing differences in the way the year-end
&THORN;gures are presented. <BR>
<BR>
For each company, an attempt was made to gain the most accurate and recent
revenue &THORN;gure, based on published information from the company. In
some cases, information came directly from the company via a questionnaire
or an existing list that was then veri&THORN;ed. In Bulgaria, for example,
&THORN;gures for company revenue are not included in the minimal amount
of information all companies are obliged to publish, so data must be obtained
from the government's department of statistics. <BR>
<BR>
The scarcity of information on Bulgarian enterprises re&thorn;ects the government's
lack of commitment to reform through privatisation. This seems to have caught
up with it suddenly in the form of a recent devaluation and economic crisis.
As the government tries to rid itself of some of its most expensive commitments,
the valuation of state companies and their assets will become a priority,
improving access to statistics as a by-product. <BR>
<BR>
Baltic companies have yet to be tracked by a reliable independent third
party, but newspapers and journals publish many unof&THORN;cial lists. In
Estonia, the country's lead in privatisation has created a demand for company
information while Latvia and Lithuania are committed to &THORN;nishing privatisation
by the end of 1997. <BR>
<BR>
In the Czech Republic, there are several rankings of the largest companies.
The &THORN;rst, the Resources 300, appeared in 1994 and was followed by
the Czech Top 100, compiled by ING Bank and published in the country's leading
economic newspaper. The database and publishing company ASPEKT Kilcullen
gathers data for its ranking via questionnaires and publishes the results
monthly. Our list is derived from the Czech Top 100 and ASPEKT Kilcullen.
<BR>
<BR>
In the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia the initial data source was
a publication called <I>100+100 Most Successful Enterprises of the Republic
of Macedonia</I>, veri&THORN;ed through checks with the companies concerned.
State enterprises are still the largest by far in this country, which is
beginning to restructure and privatise. Its small privately owned companies
make an important contribution to the economy. <BR>
<BR>
The Polish list was based on the most used ranking, the <I>Gazeta Bankowa</I>
Top 500. Additional information was gathered by surveying companies directly.
That 500 such companies can be tracked indicates the depth of Poland's economy.
The country's political situation is less stable than that of its neighbour
to the south, but not enough to cause investors great concern. The sheer
size of Poland and its population make the country a more interesting and
difficult market. <BR>
<BR>
Romania's information was drawn from a government list issued in August
1995 that includes nearly 4,000 state companies slated for privatisation.
It excludes the <I>regies autonomes</I>, autonomously administered state-owned
companies not available for privatisation, such as the national railways
and telecommunications utilities for which no turnover or revenue &THORN;gures
are published. Typically, the largest private-sector creations reveal no
data, but they would not be large enough to make this list. <BR>
<BR>
The &THORN;gures for Slovakia are based on a list of companies from the
economic weekly <I>Trend</I> and were checked by a questionnaire to each
of the companies in question. The availability of mid-year 1995 &THORN;gures
allowed us to present the &quot;new&quot; top 10 list of Slovak companies.
<BR>
<BR>
Despite its small size, Slovenia does contribute companies to the list.
The initial data sources were published lists from MAG magazine and from
the <I>Economic Gazette</I>. Information was checked with the statistical
office and with companies themselves. The Economic Institute in Belgrade
was the source of the Yugoslav list. With the sanctions lifted less than
a year ago and privatisation still under discussion this list, although
accurate at present, is due to undergo some major changes. <BR>

<H2>WHAT IS COMPETITION?  </H2>

<H4>Why do some nations fall behind while others charge ahead? The Global
Competitiveness Report sheds some light, writes Frederick Hu </H4>
Short of military conquest, economic growth is the only viable means for
a country to sustain increases in national wealth and living standards.
Yet throughout history, growth rates have varied widely. And this matters:
several percentage points of growth differentials, if persistent, make a
huge difference to the living standards and the balance of economic power
between nations. <BR>
<BR>
The Industrial Revolution and the subsequent rapid expansion in output made
Britain the world's greatest power for much of the 18th and 19th centuries.
Since the turn of the 20th century, the US has taken its place. But for
a millennium before the west's rise, China had the world's largest economy
and was the most technologically advanced nation. Economic stagnation and
a lack of technological progress in the late Ching dynasty allowed the country
to fall behind Europe, north America and, by the dawn of the 20th century,
Japan too. <BR>
<BR>
In the years just after World War II, the Soviet Union's industrial production
expanded rapidly under a centrally planned system, inspiring fear from advanced
western capitalist countries and admiration from newly independent but economically
less developed nations. In east Asia, economic prospects were bleak. Japan
was lamenting its defeat and destruction; Hong Kong was a poor island crowded
with refugees and slums; Korea was torn in a brutal civil war; Singapore
was a sleeping city with an uncertain future and Taiwan had an agricultural
economy under the threat of continuing civil war with the mainland. Only
the Philippines showed promise. <BR>
<BR>
Four decades later, Japan is a world leader in technology and has the second
largest economy. Hong Kong and Singapore are thriving &THORN;nancial and
trading service centres and South Korea and Taiwan are industrialised economies
with a strong manufacturing base. Rapid growth has lifted countries of the
region from extreme poverty to stunning prosperity within a generation.
Some east Asian nations' per capita income now matches or surpasses standards
in north America and Europe. <BR>
<BR>
East Asia's economic miracle sharply contrasts with what happened to Argentina,
a highly prosperous country between the world wars, the former Soviet Union
and the Philippines. Alternative economic systems, development strategies
and government policies have produced strikingly different outcomes. Some
nations fall behind, some catch up and some charge ahead. What word if not
competition describes this dynamic pattern in the world economy? There are
winners (fast- growing economies) and losers (slowly growing or stagnating
ones). In this sense nations compete, but not necessarily at each other's
expense. <BR>
<BR>
What does it take for a country to move ahead of others in economic growth?
The answer to this question, together with an analysis of how individual
nations are faring now, provides the impetus behind <I>The Global Competitiveness
Report 1996</I>. <BR>
<BR>
In the report, competitiveness is de&THORN;ned as a nation's capacity to
achieve economic growth. An economy is internationally competitive if it
performs strongly in three general areas: abundant productive inputs such
as capital, labour, infrastructure and technology; optimal economic policies
such as low taxes, little interference and free trade and sound market institutions
such as the rule of law and the protection of property rights. Some of the
report's important methodological advances are outlined by Jeffrey Sachs
(see page 8). <BR>
<BR>
<B>The main conclusions </B><BR>
<BR>
There are a number of basic conclusions that can be reached from this year's
rankings. As readers of newspaper headlines will have seen, the EU is slipping
behind many parts of the world in economic competitiveness. Prevailing social
welfare systems are proving to be too costly even for rich European countries
such as France, Germany and Sweden: the subject of a separate essay in the
competitiveness report<I>.</I> <BR>
<BR>
Five of the six most competitive nations are small, open economies with
relatively small governments and low tax rates: Singapore, Hong Kong, New
Zealand, Luxemburg and Switzerland. The US comes in fourth, well ahead of
the EU and Japan. Many reforming states, such as Russia, China, India and
Brazil, are still in a relatively early phase of achieving competitive policies
and institutions. They have come a long way from their recent past as closed
and state-led economies. But they have not yet created the conditions to
ensure sustained high rates of economic growth. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, poor countries such as China and India enjoy a growth dividend
as a result of their initial low levels of income, so they are expanding
rapidly despite enormous de&THORN;ciencies in economic institutions. Future
growth will require institutional reforms. <BR>
<BR>
This year's Competitiveness Index is shown in Table 1 (page 17). Singapore
tops the list, followed by Hong Kong and New Zealand. The US is fourth,
trailed by Luxemburg, Switzerland, Norway and Canada. The EU countries are
generally further down the list. Denmark is 11th, followed by the UK -
the country most at odds with overall EU policies - at 15th. <BR>
<BR>
This year, Japan is 13th and Germany 22nd. Chile is the top-ranked developing
country outside Asia. Many of the most talked-about reforming developing
economies - Brazil, the Czech Republic, India, Poland, Russia and South
Africa - remain far down the list. <BR>
<BR>
Some countries deserve particular comment. Singapore is the quintessential
entrep&ocirc;t economy: a centre of &THORN;nance and trade, a hub for the
regional activities of major multinationals and a manufacturer in its own
right. It ranks very high in every factor and tops the list, as be&THORN;ts
one of the world's fastest growing economies and a country that takes more
foreign direct investment as a percentage of gross domestic product than
any other. <BR>
<BR>
In third place is New Zealand, the new star. Its ranking is a tribute to
a decade of structural and policy reforms which include opening the economy,
cutting government spending, widespread privatisation and innovating in
many areas of governmental action from &THORN;scal policies to pensions
and central banking. New Zealand's reforms will be widely studied and emulated
in future years. <BR>
<BR>
The US is the most competitive of all the large economies with populations
of more than 10 million or so, but is fourth overall in the rankings. The
US falls below the front-runners because of its moderately high rates of
government spending and taxation, its relatively low rate of national saving
and the simmering frustrations with the justice system recorded by the Executive
Survey, a poll of business leaders that forms one of the report's competitiveness
criteria. It shows its greatest comparative strengths in infrastructure,
technology and management. <BR>
<BR>
Japan, recently widely admired as the most competitive nation, ranks 13th.
This is mainly because of its lack of openess to international trade and
&THORN;nance and its continuing &THORN;scal problems linked to the banking
crisis. Japan is recovering from its current recession but will not retake
the lead in global competitiveness without extensive economic liberalisation.
Despite slippage in some areas, Japan remains ranked highest overall for
technology. <BR>
<BR>
<B>An ill mood in Germany </B><BR>
<BR>
Germany, the economic powerhouse of the EU, can manage only 22nd place.
This is consistent with the ill mood in Germany, as social partners debate
the reduction of the welfare state. Germany, together with many of its partners
in the EU, ranks especially poorly in government and labour market &thorn;exibility
but does better in infrastructure and technology. <BR>
<BR>
Virtually all Latin American economies have made impressive progress on
opening to international trade, trimming the size of the state and allowing
markets to function. Nevertheless, the Competitiveness Index suggests that
only Chile has achieved a fairly high degree of international competitiveness.
Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil (in that order)
still lag far behind. <BR>
<BR>
The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland have some way to go to achieve high
and sustainable growth. Although these economies have made startling progress
in creating democratic, capitalist economies and have resumed economic growth,
they still fall short in almost every factor of competitiveness. The countries
are notably weak in government, because government spending and taxation
remain very high as a percentage of GDP. They do poorly in areas such as
infrastructure, technology and management, the legacy of decades of forced
isolation from world markets. <BR>
<BR>
Russia is the least competitive of all the countries included in the report.
Neither the quantitative nor the survey data could relieve the general gloom.
Russia is still relatively isolated from world markets, taxation is high
and unstable and there is general disdain for the infrastructure, technology
and management. Only labour &thorn;exibility shows a mild, rather than strong,
negative. The country ranks last in its political and judicial institutions.
<BR>
<BR>
We want to emphasise that the rankings are only approximations. There are
signi&THORN;cant conceptual and empirical problems in squeezing a country's
growth-producing or growth-retarding attributes into a single quantitative
index. Even some of the data from 1994 and last year are out of date, especially
in the most rapidly reforming countries. This is an inevitable hazard of
cross-country comparisons. Nonetheless, the list tells an important story
and gives strong evidence about a country's relative capacity to achieve
future sustained economic growth. <BR>
<BR>
In addition to the main Competitiveness Index, we have introduced two supplementary
indicators of national competitiveness - the Growth Index and the Market
Growth Index. The Growth Index, generated from a regression model that relates
growth to the Competitiveness Index and initial income, aims to rank nations'
medium-term growth prospects. <BR>
<BR>
For a given level of competitiveness, it is reasonable to expect that poorer
countries will tend to grow faster than richer countries, partly because
poorer ones have the advantage of borrowing technology, ideas and capital
from the richer ones and partly because the market returns to new investment
(and therefore the saving and investment rates as well) tend to be higher
in the poorer countries. <BR>
<BR>
<B>New measurement for growth </B><BR>
<BR>
The Market Growth Index takes into account the size of the respective markets.
Measured in purchasing power parity dollars in 1994, the total GDP of the
49 countries was roughly $28 trillion. The GDP of the US was about $6.7
trillion, or 24% of the total. Singapore's GDP, by contrast, was $60 billion,
or 0.2% of the total. <BR>
<BR>
Even though Singapore is likely to grow more rapidly, the US will account
for a much larger share of future total world economic growth. The Market
Growth Index ranks a country's share of economic growth in the total world
growth. <BR>
<BR>
By introducing <I>The Global Competitiveness Report 1996</I>, we have a
better understanding of the complex issue of competitiveness and its relation
to growth. While the debate continues, the World Economic Forum will continue
to provide in-depth research and analysis in its future reports on global
competitiveness.* <BR>

<H2>HOME THOUGHTS FROM ABROAD </H2>

<H4>From Hong Kong, Chris Patten is leaping into the debate at the heart
of Europe, writes Francis Harris </H4>

There are politer ways to say it, but the truth is that the marriage between
Britain and the Hong Kong business community has everything to do with convenience
and little to do with love. To understand that you only have to meet Britain's
last mail-order-bride, Chris Patten: the Conservative Party politician chosen
as colonial governor to oversee reunification with China next year. <BR>
<BR>
The governor has been at the centre of a number of bitter rows with Beijing
and the Chinese-dominated business elite. On the day he spoke to <I>World
Link</I>, the Englishman was visibly preoccupied and exhausted by the most
recent public exchanges with business leaders over what he did or did not
say in an interview with <I>Newsweek</I> magazine. <BR>
<BR>
The atmosphere is souring as the months before the handover tick away. So
when Patten suggested to <I>Newsweek</I> that businessmen were ready to
support Beijing's plans to dump his democratic reforms only because they
had &quot;foreign passports in their back pockets&quot;, there was a storm.
As <I>The South China Morning Post</I> pointed out: &quot;The popular perception...
is that Mr Patten used the interview to accuse local entrepreneurs of betrayal.&quot;
Beijing has accused him of worse for his attempts to introduce limited democracy:
&quot;Criminal for 1,000 generations&quot; was one of the more polite brickbats.
<BR>
<BR>
Were Patten in the usual mould of colonial bosses - a career diplomat
or a minor politician - these disputes might already have tarred him
forever as the man who alienated China. But he is more substantial, both
intellectually and politically. The handover, due at midnight on June 30,
1997, will herald a new dawn for the colony. It will also mark a new beginning
for Patten, tipped by some on the Conservative left as a future party leader
and prime minister. <BR>
<BR>
Despite the sometimes fetid political atmosphere, Patten still seems willing
to tackle potentially controversial subjects. Sitting in the splendour of
the governor's mansion, he talks freely when asked about the Asian values
that regional leaders such as Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore suggest set the
continent apart from the west. Is their use of the term just a way of telling
the west to mind its own business? <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yes it is. I think it is consistently used as a way of telling other
countries to get off Asian leaders' patches. It is a spurious argument.
How Confucian is it to focus discussion of one's success on GDP growth and
how Confucian is what happens in the explosive capitalist development in
parts of China? Confucius is sometimes used to justify almost anything.
I don't think Confucianism, which used to be used to explain low levels
of economic activity in Asia, is the reason for Asia's success.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Free trade, not low pay </B><BR>
<BR>
That raises the overtly political question of what does lie behind Asia's
success, a tricky subject often raised by both the governor and Hong Kong
businessmen. Tricky also because Asian success is often cited by members
of Patten's party in Britain as an alternative to Europe's supposedly state
interventionist EU. So is Asian success, as is sometimes suggested, a victory
for low pay? <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In certain commercial and industrial sectors investment inevitably
chases low labour costs, although it is easy to over-emphasise the importance
of that in Europe and north America. The reasons for Asian economic success
lie elsewhere. The biggest single reason is the expansion of world trade
and access to the US.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Patten cites gloomy forecasts made about Asia in the '50s and '60s: &quot;What
they said about it was similar to what people have been saying about Africa
for the past 10 years. One reason for that is that they were expecting the
expansion of global markets to slow. [Yet] they were on the threshold of
a period in which trade increased threefold. The biggest argument for free
trade is what's happened in Asia. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You can think of other policies [to explain Asia's success]. You can
point to sensible macroeconomic policies, you can point to stable political
structures in most of the countries, you can point to talent and entrepreneurial
flair. It seems to me just as it was in the Industrial Revolution.&quot;
Perhaps, then, thinking in the west is over-simplified? &quot;It is a debate
that tends to give people the opportunity to fit arguments to their prejudices.
On the whole, I have found that my experience here has [had the effect of]
dismantling many of my prejudices rather than reinvigorating them.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
In discussing Asia's success, the governor is positioning himself as a signi&THORN;cant
figure in the central economic and political discussion about the relative
merits of the Asian, European and north American experience. It is not without
risk: by the time the message has made the long haul back to the west, it
can arrive shorn of its subtleties and Patten has been derided for allegedly
proposing to foster Asian-style growth in Europe simply by cutting spending.
Government spending in the region, for example, is less than half that in
western Europe at about 20% of GDP. <BR>
<BR>
Asked about this, Patten is keen to offer a full explanation. &quot;Comparing
western and Asian spending can lead to crude over-simplifications. I tend
to discover that my caveats and conditional clauses are ignored and claims
that I would not dream of making are placed in my mouth because people assume
the point I am making is less sophisticated than the one I am trying to
argue. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The point is... that while I do not believe the proportion of GDP
taken by public spending or tax is the main feature or sole [condition]
for rapid economic growth, there is a relationship between those factors.
That is one of many lessons that can be taken from Asia's developed economies.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There is a subset of arguments: first that Asian politicians have
been much less ready than European and maybe north American [ones] to associate
the public good, which is often defined in terms of compassion, with public
spending. A related proposition is that an economy such as this one has
been much better at tapping private investment to achieve public good than
we have been, on the whole, in Europe. They are also more conscious of the
difference between capital and current spending than some European treasuries.&quot;
While in Europe, Patten says, public demand for services is in control of
public spending. <BR>
<BR>
This issue is moving to the heart of the debate about the economic destiny
of the EU. If, as is often suggested, the EU and to a lesser extent the
US cannot afford the rising burden of public expenditure, if the 15 member
states cannot make good the promises they made to their peoples by creating
welfare states after World War II, there will be some painful and widely
resented cuts. Few politicians are willing even to discuss the issue, let
alone suggest remedies. <BR>
<BR>
At first it seems Patten is going to steer clear of this minefield. &quot;I
am in a position that is politically precarious and that makes me intellectually
timid. If I start setting out an agenda for the public sector, I risk criticism
that I am becoming too political. So I have to err on the side of making
myself a target for all those who say 'He's doing the easy thing; stating
the objective but not how he would get there'.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
And then, perhaps typically, he leaps into the fray. He employs generalities,
but his targets are rather identi&THORN;able. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;However, let me offer three general propositions. First, when the
welfare state - and this is true of most of Europe - was introduced
or rather extended after the war, the assumption was that unless it was
available to the middle class as well as those who were less well-off, the
middle class would resent the tax burden required to pay for other people's
social provision. That has pushed us into a set of taxpayer-funded social
obligations that are far beyond what was ever intended and far beyond what
is desirable or in the long run affordable. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Addressing that is hard: dismantling middle-class benefits requires
courage. I reckon that is what politicians across Europe will find themselves
doing, and doubtless losing elections for doing, in the next period. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Second, I feel strongly that people need to be aware of the cost of
the social goods that they vote for and desire. The more cost can be linked
to the service provided the better. That is why in the UK I always favoured
a health tax, which was advocated by Leon Brittan [now an EU commissioner]
and others in the '80s. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Third, I feel that local taxation has some advantages over central
[taxation] in relating provision to cost. My fairly cheerless experience
of presiding over local government financing led me to the conclusion that
too much is paid for centrally, certainly in the UK, and that more should
be run locally.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He pauses. Perhaps it his politician's sense that he may have said more
than he intended. He con&THORN;rms this, muttering that he has just gone
further than before in laying out his ideas. <BR>
<BR>
Such thoughts will not matter if Patten intends to retire after June 30,
1997. If, as many suspect, he intends to return to political life every
word could become ammunition for his enemies. The UK press has made much
of his likely return, with speculation recently fuelled by prime minister
John Major when he offered warm praise for Patten. But for the moment at
least, he is coy on the subject. Is it fair to suggest he is pitching for
a leading role in the Conservative Party after the next election? <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It is a fair assessment of what some people in the press say. It is
not a fair assessment of what I do or say or think. Do I spend every waking
moment thinking about what I'm going to do after June 30, 1997? No I don't.
If I do think about life after Hong Kong, I tend to think about it in terms
of sitting under a tree with a book and a glass of <I>vin blanc cassis</I>.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The only things I know for certain is that I'm going to take some
time off, that I want to write, that I would like in due course another
proper job and that, as you have observed, I still have an interest in political
issues. Although it sounds incredibly pompous to say so, I would like to
make a contribution to those debates. Not just a contribution as a rather
old-fashioned Tory, but a contribution as one who has spent five years after
a political career running one of the biggest cities in Asia and one of
the most important cities in the world.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
That sounds like a politician pitching for a future role in political life.
If Patten does have a political existence after Hong Kong, it will likely
involve him in what is probably the UK's most important political debate
since the beginning of this century: Europe. <BR>
<BR>
For that reason, his recent interviews and speeches will generate interest
in the chancelleries of Europe. Once regarded as a Europhile, it has been
said that the governor's Asian experience has made him more of a Eurosceptic,
someone more in tune with the right wing of his party at home. Patten acknowledges
some change but chooses his words carefully. &quot;I am not more sceptical
of the imperative of Britain's role in Europe. I am more sceptical of how
European commitment is defined. There is a political correctness about it
that I find rather unsatisfactory,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
Does that mean that British political debate is too focused on the EU? &quot;I
think it is rather limited. I am much persuaded by the arguments of Timothy
Garton Ash [a writer and fellow at St Antony's College, Oxford] about the
real objective in Europe being enlargement and the salvation of democracy,
freedom and decency in central and eastern Europe, rather than some of the
present preoccupations. I don't take [that] to be an excuse for avoiding
the difficult arguments about sovereignty and the relationship between nation
states and Brussels. Those arguments apply whether [or not] you're talking
about enlargement.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Finally, Patten returns to the subject of Hong Kong, including the legacy
of the British and its last governor, Chris Patten. Outside, the trappings
of empire are intact: the beautiful governor's mansion on the island's Mid-Levels
is ringed by flowers and impeccably dressed colonial policemen: below, on
the harbour, there is a British forces headquarters and on the hills above,
the dishes of the GCHQ electronic eavesdropping stations. <BR>
<BR>
No one is sure what will become of them after next July (Hong Kong officials
joke that the governor's mansion will become a museum of British atrocities).
If Patten gives it any thought, there is little indication. He talks of
the future, comparing the colony to New York. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The most over-worked cliche about Hong Kong, which just happens to
be true, is that it stands a good chance of being the New York of Asia.
Everybody focuses on the political transition in Hong Kong. But there's
another shift as well: from being a rich city - improbably rich given
our circumstances, a spectacular refugee success story at the gateway to
China - to being one of the world's greatest business and financial
centres, perhaps the greatest. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I believe Hong Kong is most likely to make that transition if it retains
its present decencies and freedoms - if it maintains the rule of law,
a clean and decent public administration... civil liberties and open, accountable
and steadily more democratic government - than if it does not. But
plenty of critics, some of them businessmen, do not agree with me. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;For me, there is a precise match between giving the people of Hong
Kong what they were promised in the Joint Declaration [between Britain and
China] and helping Hong Kong on the road to that transition. You only have
to read the international press to realise that some actions taken by China
and some things said by China's friends here recently have raised doubts
in some people's minds about our ability to make that transition. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think that is a pity and I hope it is not the end of the story.
No one can doubt the extraordinary economic momentum, which has almost doubled
our GDP since the Joint Declaration was signed and has increased it by a
quarter since I arrived [in 1992]. But for that momentum to go as far as
it can, the framework that has powered Hong Kong forward has to be retained.
That is what I see as being my main purpose here.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Patten will likely be disappointed in his hope of seeing that framwork left
untouched. But if China and his enemies in the business elite think they
have seen he last of him, they too are likely to be disappointed. Patten
may disappear from Hong Kong, but east Asia may well meet him again in another
guise, representing a country that is still the biggest European investor
in the region.

<H2>A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY? </H2>

<H4>Some global &THORN;rms are doing much to help staff with children to
juggle their commitments. But many still resist change, Elisabeth Faure
shows in a poll </H4>
With more women workers struggling to balance commitments to work and family,
employers are under greater pressure than ever before to adopt &quot;family-friendly&quot;
policies to help staff balance those demands. <I>World Link </I>has surveyed
16 large US and European firms to discover their approach (see page 42).
The results suggest that provision has as much to do with national attitudes
and legislation as with individual company initiatives. <BR>
<BR>
Attitudes have some way to go. According to Susan Hay, the founder of the
&THORN;rst nursery in the City of London, a senior partner in a leading
law &THORN;rm once told her that not only did he regard her work as &quot;subversive&quot;,
he viewed the prospect of young children in his railway carriage as intolerable.
<BR>
<BR>
Those campaigning for change often hear this sort of response. Many &THORN;rms
are concerned only with what happens in the office. &quot;Outside&quot;
issues are seen as personal. But there is growing evidence that in some
sectors, often those in which women traditionally form a large part of the
workforce and especially among large corporations and multinationals, company
policy is changing. Some may have been won over by the expanding body of
research that shows that family-friendly &THORN;rms have reduced absenteeism,
cut staff turnover, increased productivity, attracted better recruits, improved
their image and lifted staff morale. <BR>
<BR>
Others may have been persuaded to change by the growing weight of demographic
factors that are radically changing the look of the workforce. Women will
make up 75% of Europe's new workers by the year 2000, according to &THORN;gures
from the EU. Employment among European women with children below the age
of 10 rose from 42% to 49% between 1985-90. In the UK, the government's
employment department says that the greatest increase in labour market participation
has been among women with children under &THORN;ve, up from 37% in 1984
to 52% last year. In the US, 60% of women with children under the age of
six now work outside the home. <BR>
<BR>
Whatever the reason, more companies now admit that employees' private lives
affect their work performance and recognise that schemes to improve the
quality of their lives can pay dividends. A 1990 survey by the US department
of labour showed that of 400 staff with children below the age of 12, childcare
problems were the most signi&THORN;cant predictors of absenteeism and inefficiency
at work. <BR>
<BR>
Among those companies that have enacted family-friendly policies, there
are wide variations in what they offer and to whom they offer it. Some indication
of this can be seen in the chart below. It examines a number of working
practices that are designed to help both women and men balance work and
family commitments, including nursery provision, job-shares and telephone
work and subsidised day-care. For many companies such policies are a sensitive
issue, which may help to explain why &THORN;rms such as Banque Paribas and
Arthur Andersen felt unable to respond to our survey. <BR>
<BR>
Liz Burgh is the director of Opportunity 2000, a British organisation campaigning
for family-friendly work practices. She reports that all of her members,
including the Rank Organisation leisure company and the high-street pharmacy
chain Boots, have changed course largely for economic reasons. Prominent
converts such as Lord Tugendhat, the chairman of Abbey National, refer to
corporate welfare as enlightened self-interest, she adds. <BR>
<BR>
The high cost of training is leading big &THORN;rms to try to staunch the
exodus of skilled working mothers. Britain's Midland Bank, for example,
has estimated that the cost of losing and replacing one experienced staff
member was equivalent to his or her total annual employment costs. On the
other hand, the cost of keeping a child in a nursery from six months to
school age is about &#163;10,000 ($15,000). <BR>
<BR>
Britain's official electronic listening post, the Government Communications
Headquarters (GCHQ), estimates that it costs &#163;93,000 to train one professional
while the UK's National Health Service spends &#163;250,000 to train a doctor.
Losing research and development staff can also cost companies lucrative
commercial opportunities if a person develops a new drug or product elsewhere.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Cheaper to keep her </B><BR>
<BR>
To prevent staff losses at Midland, where 63% of staff are women, the bank
set up 115 nurseries, with dramatic results: the proportion of women returning
to work after maternity leave rose from 30% in 1988 to 85% by the end of
1994. <BR>
<BR>
Rank Organisation introduced a scheme to let new mothers return to work
gradually. After &THORN;ve years, the company saved $1.5 million and its
retention rate for skilled women rose from 20% to 80%. A similar programme
has paid off for British Rail. In 1992, the company opened two nurseries
after it realised that only 20% of staff at London's Waterloo station returned
to work full-time after maternity leave. In their first year, British Rail
estimates, the nurseries generated a net return on investment of 20%. Opportunity
2000 says that Boots doubled the number of women returning from maternity
leave by offering &thorn;exible working hours. Rank Xerox estimates that
similar policies have saved it &#163;1 million in the past &THORN;ve years.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Although &thorn;exible working is often portrayed as a means for staff
to combine work and family responsibilities, &thorn;exibility is not only
employee-friendly but employer-friendly,&quot; says Diane Perrins, a lecturer
at the Gender Institute at the London School of Economics (LSE) who feels
that &thorn;exibility has become more &quot;employer-led&quot;. Alec Laken,
a manager at the engineering company Allied Signal, agrees: &quot;Employees
[working &thorn;exible hours] are happier, particularly in their relationships
with their managers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Despite such arguments, most companies remain unswayed and little has changed
for most working women, to their strong regret. &quot;In Europe, 60% of
women who work full-time would prefer to work part-time, and 80%-90% of
women working part-time are happy working fewer hours,&quot; says Catherine
Hakim, author of the book <I>Female heterogeneity and the polarisation of
women's employment</I>. <BR>
<BR>
A recent article in <I>Business Week</I> suggests that even many well-educated,
professional women are unhappy with their conditions. The article traces
the careers of six women from the '80s to the present. In one typical example
Chantal Davies, a senior project &THORN;nance director at SG Warburg, found
that both her work and personal life suffered after her first child was
born. Chantal would kiss her son in the morning on her way to work and again
at 8pm on her return, when he was asleep. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Informal and unbinding </B><BR>
<BR>
While on maternity leave with her second child she decided to quit international
&THORN;nance, although she would have continued had her job been more &thorn;exible.
&quot;Unless you were prepared to make it your top priority, you were heading
for trouble,&quot; she says in the article. <BR>
<BR>
Where family-friendly policies do exist they are often informal, particularly
in the UK. It is common for each branch of a company to have a different
set of welfare policies and for employees to arrange their bene&THORN;ts
individually with line managers. Burgh of Opportunity 2000 recognises that
&quot;there is a resistance to formalising policies that are seen as binding&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
This can hurt junior staff. A senior executive whose child attends the Broadgate
nursery in the City of London said to her employer: &quot;I have found the
childcare that I need - please pay&quot;. Her request was granted,
but that was probably a re&thorn;ection of her negotiating power. Perrins
of the LSE says that &quot;the discretionary nature of childcare is very
selective and enables companies to retain senior staff&quot;. Indeed, some
companies in the index, including American Express Europe and the Bank of
Ireland, make job-sharing available to directors but not to most junior
staff. <BR>
<BR>
Employers' resistance is partly understandable: workplace nurseries are
expensive to set up, for example. But there are cheaper options such as
&thorn;exitime, subsidising places in an independent nursery and offering
childcare information and referral services. <BR>
<BR>
The childcare consultant Hay would rarely advise firms to set up a nursery:
&quot;Only if a company were moving out of the capital would it be worthwhile.&quot;
Most of those firms in the index which provide childcare, including PepsiCo,
UBS, American Express Europe and the Bank of Ireland, subsidise places in
local nurseries. <BR>
<BR>
In resisting family-friendly policies, employers often argue that only a
few staff members would bene&THORN;t. Some employers also worry that male
staff will also demand the use of childcare services, thus adding costs
which should be carried by their wives' employers. However, research published
by <I>The Harvard Business Review</I> in 1990 shows that provision of childcare
boosts the morale of all company staff, regardless of sex. <BR>
<BR>
The chart opposite should be read with a number of provisos. The industry
in which a company operates, the type of workforce, existing work policies
and the level of community childcare services all have a bearing on what
any individual company may offer. <BR>
<BR>
A manufacturing company can hardly be criticised for not offering its employees
the option of teleworking - it is impossible to build a car from home.
On the other hand &thorn;exitime is particularly suited to manufacturing,
where shift work is common. At BMW's Regensburg production plant, for instance,
machines run on a six-day week cycle and employees work an average of four
days a week. <BR>
<BR>
Some companies, often in the &THORN;nancial sector, argue that they need
not be family-friendly because women tend to be under-represented in their
industry. At Merrill Lynch in London, for example, only 16% of front-office
staff are female. National legislation also plays a role. Where the government
is committed to family-friendly working conditions, as in Denmark, France
and Belgium, corporate welfare policies are correspondingly more generous.
In France, employers are required by law to contribute to &quot;family allowance
funds&quot; which are used to support local childcare services. Accessible,
high-quality state nursery education leaves companies free to focus on allowing
employees &thorn;exible work hours. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Economy blowing hot and cold </B><BR>
<BR>
The economic climate also plays a role. When Hay set up the &THORN;rst nursery
in the City of London in 1991, the recession was at its peak and many companies
felt obliged to withdraw their support. &quot;The recession separated the
employers who see childcare as a long-term commitment from the more aggressive
ones seeking short-term gain,&quot; she says. The Swiss bank UBS was hit
by the economic downturn, but did not abandon its childcare commitment.
<BR>
<BR>
Although corporate welfare provision as a whole is poor some companies stand
out, offering a number of imaginative models from which other &THORN;rms
can learn. One is the provision of childcare advice, an increasingly popular
option because it is cheap and universal. Ford provides an electronic bulletin
board through which working parents can obtain childcare information and
advice while UBS offers a toll-free telephone number for the same purpose.
At its headquarters, Allied Signal provides not only a nursery for 100 children
but also an emergency childcare service. If an employee whose child does
not attend the nursery has a problem, the nursery can provide cover at short
notice. <BR>
<BR>
PepsiCo has developed a scheme called &quot;compress work week&quot;. Each
week throughout the summer, employees are given half a day of holiday in
return for working longer hours the rest of week. The aim is to allow workers
and their families time to enjoy the summer weather. PepsiCo also provides
a dependant care reserve account so that staff can pay for such care on
a pre-tax basis. Patagonia, a US outdoor-wear manufacturer, has gone one
step further and allows administrative staff, including nursing mothers,
to keep children with them as they work. <BR>
<BR>
Many German corporations have developed comprehensive &thorn;exible working
schemes that are available to workers throughout the company. In its human
resources pamphlet, BMW promises that &quot;every request to work part-time
will be met&quot;. About 16,000 BMW employees can use &thorn;exitime and
more than 1,600 work part-time and the &THORN;rm has a network of child-minders.
About half of the workers at Siemens work &thorn;exible hours, and 80% of
all employees at Schering AG enjoy &thorn;exible working. <BR>
<BR>
Barclays Bank is noteworthy because it is one of the few British companies
to provide a complete range of bene&THORN;ts. These include career breaks
of up to two years, up to 12 weeks' unpaid paternity leave for fathers and
52 weeks' maternity leave for mothers. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Few women at the upper end of the corporate hierarchy in the UK have
children and even they don't often make it to the top,&quot; states Perrins
from the LSE. It is a situation that is likely to continue, in Britain and
many other countries around the world, unless employers accept the need
for reform.<BR>

<H2>FROM THE EDITOR </H2>

<H3>The state of competition </H3>

<H4>The debate about comparing national performance and growth continues
to stimulate useful questions </H4>


The idea of measuring national performance by ranking a country's competitiveness
and potential for growth has made headlines again. The renewed attention
is partly due to an outbreak of competition in the world of competitiveness:
the initial findings of a rival report were rushed out before the World
Economic Forum's long-established version was published in a substantially
revamped form in May. <BR>
<BR>
The main reason, however, remains vanity: countries care how they rate,
even as they deride the ranking exercise. The public, and experts, also
like to compare and contrast. They get another chance to do so in this issue
of <I>World Link, </I>with a ranking of the top 100 companies in central
and eastern Europe, a Who's Who guide to leading business figures in the
region and an assessment of &quot;family-friendly&quot; policies in the
world's top corporations. <BR>
<BR>
After new criteria used by the Forum in <I>The Global Competitiveness Report
1996 </I>put France somewhat lower on the index than previously, for example,
President Jacques Chirac could be heard denouncing &quot;Davosian&quot;
thinking on globalisation, in an apparent reference to the site of the Forum's
annual summit. On the other side of the coin, there was suspicion in London
among critics of the current Conservative government when it was noted that
Britain did slightly better than before: at a press conference one journalist
went so far as to wonder if Downing Street had lobbied for an improved result.
<BR>
<BR>
Some critics con&thorn;ate a global perspective with the politics of &quot;small
government&quot;, believing that the economic liberal is identical with
the political conservative. Such a con&thorn;ation is limited and wrong,
especially because the old right-left argument about small versus large
government has begun to shift. In his new column in this issue, Jeffrey
Sachs does argue that government interference can harm growth. But he also
puts the state &THORN;rmly in centre stage. If you look closely at the case
for why competitiveness matters, it is that good or bad policies make all
the difference to economic success, and policies are made by governments.
The state is crucial because it is able to influence outcomes. <BR>
<BR>
On this point at least Sachs is in agreement with the World Bank, whose
recently issued 1997 Development Report explores the role of the state.
Re&thorn;ecting a growing trend in political economy, it argues that &quot;the
state and market are institutionally intertwined&quot; and an &quot;activist
government&quot; can play a key catalytic role. The old debate, positing
a clear choice between the state and the market, &quot;now seems to be over&quot;,
with the limits of each revealed: the new aim is to make sure that one does
not dominate the other. There is no simple &quot;the market solves everything&quot;
argument. <BR>
<BR>
While politics are bound to flavour debates about competitiveness, there
is a more interesting impetus behind the revised competitiveness report:
to acknowledge some of the useful criticism it has received in the past
few years and to use the report's comparative model as the basis for yet
more questioning. Let the debates and dissent continue. <BR>
<BR>
This magazine often likes to take a contrarian approach to issues. The reason
is that the contrarian approach, at its most serious, is most likely to
tell you something you did not already know and need to know, before everyone
else tells you. Even at its most trivial, it leaves room for humour and
imagination. <BR>
<BR>
It was such an approach that alerted readers of our January/February issue
to the importance of General Alexander Lebed in Russian politics. At the
time, other commentators dismissed him as marginal but this June's presidential
elections made Lebed an indispensable ally to Boris Yeltsin and perhaps
poised for future power. We hope to offer yet more insights.<BR>

<H2>COMMENT</H2>
<H4>Developments in Asia show why we need to integrate economic and security
issues in any foreign analysis </H4>
<H3>The new policy mix </H3>
In the Cold War years, business leaders and policymakers in the major nations
grew accustomed to thinking of economics and security separately. Security
was a matter of force deployments and strategies for using them. Economics
was about managing stable growth. <BR>
<BR>
Although many analysts probably recognised political-economic linkages in
the abstract, they felt them unnecessary to explain real-world events. The
political parameters of the world economy, with two superpowers and international
institutions such as Gatt for trade and Bretton Woods for the monetary system,
were relatively stable. <BR>
<BR>
The world has changed shape, however, and this division is no longer tenable.
Policies made with only one perspective - either political or economic
- will leave policymakers &THORN;ghting with one hand tied behind their
backs. The likely evolution of global affairs over the coming decade will
force a much more sophisticated integration of the two, re&thorn;ecting
their growing interaction. It will also mandate the emergence of new institutions
to neutralise the dangerous side-effects of this interaction. <BR>
<BR>
A key factor in the evolution of global affairs is the decisive new impact
being made by East Asia, which threatens to overshadow that of the Middle
East and eastern Europe. After petro-power collapsed in the early '80s,
Japan was the only rising economic power with the potential to challenge
the equilibrium of international relations. However, the country's insularity,
reactive political processes and limited military capacity severely blunted
its geopolitical impact. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, as east Asia's dynamism expands beyond Japan, Hong Kong and
South Korea towards the massive continent of Asia and the Indonesian archipelago,
the region's influence will expand. <BR>
<BR>
There are three main reasons for this. The &THORN;rst is that global capital
resources will be disproportionately concentrated in the region because
of its persistent international competitiveness and trade surpluses. Together,
Japan and Greater China (including Taiwan and Hong Kong) hold close to two-thirds
of the world's foreign exchange reserves. Asia's economy makes up a third
of the global market. It accounts for more than 41% of global bank reserves,
having risen from 17% in Such surpluses are likely to continue for years,
playing a central role in global finance. <BR>
<BR>
A second reason is that these expanding economies are consuming more energy.
The International Energy Agency predicts that demand in Asia will grow at
twice the rate of the rest of the world over the next two decades. China,
which was a net oil exporter until November 1993, will emerge as a key global
importer: its imports will approach three million barrels a day by 2010.
By 2003, Indonesia too will be a net importer. With Asian imports of Mideast
oil rising, eastward traffic of oil through the Straits of Malacca should
triple within 15 years to make up more than 15% of global consumption. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Do not take stability for granted </B><BR>
<BR>
A third reason is that, despite the patterns of the past two decades, future
stability in Asia cannot be taken for granted. The most severe tensions
are likely to arise in northeast Asia where both Korea and China are changing
in historic and potentially disruptive ways. The Korean peninsula is on
the brink of sudden developments in north-south relations, including the
possibility of sudden reunification through a collapse of North Korea. A
Greater China is emerging with Hong Kong's reversion to Beijing's control
only a year away, Macao's reversion scheduled for 1999 and Taiwan's ties
to the mainland deepening despite missile tests and volatile political rhetoric.
Such developments are putting pressure on Japan's traditionally low-profile
posture. <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the most important lesson about integrating economic and security
policies is the need to recognise the destabilising political and social
consequences of rapid growth. It can lead to more spending on arms and a
tighter regional energy market: this has already happened in Asia since
the late '80s. <BR>
<BR>
As arms races become more affordable they can become more deadly, especially
given the region's rising level of missile technology. Regional energy shortages,
which are likely to be most pronounced in northeast Asian nations such as
Korea, could have security implications. One possible consequence is that
Asian nations could become more reliant on nuclear power, including plutonium-generating
reprocessing. Another is that they could develop closer political and economic
relations with the Middle East, including Iran and possibly Iraq. Shortages
could also make Asian offshore oil reserves more strategic along with east
Gulf sea lanes and the nations bordering them, such as India and Indonesia.
<BR>
<BR>
East Asia's experience suggests that decision-makers may need to broaden
traditional definitions of security and expand the range of policies that
can support security. Energy can be a legitimate, indeed a priority, issue
for security attention. Both conservation and resource development policies
can be used to respond to security challenges. <BR>
<BR>
The region's development also shows that economic and technological muscle
can have long-term strategic implications. Indeed, the inexorable rise of
economic prowess has shifted the balance of power on the Korean peninsula
and forced a once-strong North Korea virtually to its knees. <BR>
<BR>
The clearest example from east Asia is probably the US-Japan Security Treaty,
which provides invaluable political risk insurance for $200 billion in Japanese,
American and other foreign investment in Asia outside Japan. This amount
has more than doubled in the past decade. Yet as controversies over trade
and the US military base in Okinawa suggest, popular and business support
for the broader framework of US-Japan relations is fluid and not universally
accepted. <BR>
<BR>
The volatile interaction of growth, arms and energy points to the future
importance of clearly directed multilateral institutions to complement existing
US-Japan arrangements. An excellent prototype is the Korean Peninsula Energy
Development Organisation, which the US, Japan and South Korea set up in
late 1994 to provide nuclear energy and heavy oil to North Korea. <BR>
<BR>
Such bodies are needed urgently in northeast Asia because there is little
international organisation or transnational interdependence in the region.
Also useful would be broader Asian institutions to help reduce the negative
effects of regional growth. <BR>
<BR>
An example would be an Asia Atom, modelled on European precedent, to supervise
the region's nuclear development. The area could also benefit from frameworks
for offshore resource extraction and balanced force reductions, as tensions
on the Korean peninsula subside. <BR>
<BR>
Finally, there is a need for both public and private institutional mechanisms
that force decision-makers to consider the economic and security dimensions
simultaneously. In the US, a possible approach would be to give the national
security adviser a second deputy for economic affairs, who would force a
discussion of economic and security trade-offs at top levels of government.
Another would be to restructure the energy department to focus more on international
dimensions. Broader public-private dialogues on Asian political risk assessment
are also in order. <BR>
<BR>
East Asia's expansion is unlikely to falter for some time and its growth
will have some unsettling effects. However, these can be understood and
dealt with in an integrated analysis.* <BR>

<H2>SACHS ON COMPETITIVENESS</H2>

<H4>In his new regular column, the Harvard economist gives a shorthand guide
to a nation's growth prospects </H4>

<H3>Why good policy matters <BR>
</H3>
<I>By Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for International
Development <BR>
</I><BR>
At least since Adam Smith's <I>The Wealth of Nations</I> was published in
1776, economists, politicians and business people have debated the sources
of national prosperity. What economic system is most likely to promote growth
in output and living standards: free trade and private ownership or protectionism
and state ownership? <BR>
<BR>
In recent years, that debate has taken place under the rubric of international
competitiveness. Protagonists in the modern-day debate ask which system
is most likely to promote international competitiveness. In this context,
competitiveness means the ability of a nation's economy to make rapid and
sustained gains in living standards. One important yardstick of success
is the performance of other economies, especially those at comparable levels
of economic development. <BR>
<BR>
<I>The Global Competitiveness Report 1996</I>, published in May by the World
Economic Forum with the participation of our institute (see page 14), uses
a measurement designed to help assess each country's prospects for economic
growth. Formally, the competitiveness index aims to gauge the ability of
a national economy to achieve sustained high rates of economic growth measured
by annual changes in GDP per person. It is an attempt to measure growth
potential on a horizon of five to 10 years, not next year. Thus there is
less concern with the vagaries of national business cycles than with the
underlying trend rate of growth of the national economy, after smoothing
over fluctuations around the trend. <BR>
<BR>
The theoretical framework is based on modern economic growth theory, as
propounded for example by Robert Barro and Xavier Sala-I-Martin in <I>Economic
Growth. </I>In that theory, a nation's growth prospects depend on two main
factors: its initial income level and its particular characteristics, including
government policies, geography, educational base and other factors. <BR>
<BR>
For two countries with similar structural characteristics, the economic
theory predicts that the poorer country will grow faster than the richer
one. In modern economic jargon, the poorer country tends to converge with
the richer country. <BR>
<BR>
Convergence is expected for several reasons. In general, poorer countries
lack the technology, management and capital stock per person found in richer
countries. The theory predicts that the poorer country will be able to catch
up in these areas faster than the richer one will be able to make new advances.
It does so through direct imitation of the rich, by promoting higher rates
of national saving and through inflows of technology and capital from abroad.
<BR>
<BR>
The index attempts to summarise the structural characteristics of an economy,
other than initial per capita income, that are likely to determine the economy's
prospects for medium-term economic growth. Once these are measured, the
country's income level must still be taken into account in order to rank
growth prospects. For example, Luxembourg and Singapore have similarly high
ratings. Nonetheless, since Singapore still lags behind Luxembourg in per
capita income, the expectation is that Singapore will grow more rapidly
than Luxembourg in the future. <BR>
<BR>
<B>What new research can offer </B><BR>
<BR>
The competitiveness index is based on key underlying structural characteristics
of the national economies and an extensive and rapidly expanding body of
academic research on national economic growth. This academic literature
identifies several factors as key contributors to economic growth. <BR>
<BR>
In the new competitiveness report, such factors are measured on a consistent
cross-country basis and the results then summarised. It is then demonstrated
that the index indeed helps to account for cross-country economic growth
in the recent past and therefore presumably in the near future as well.
<BR>
<BR>
One of the key assumptions of the new study is that certain kinds of structural
characteristics can be measured with standard published data, while others
are better measured by opinion surveys. For example, economic theory suggests
that high marginal tax rates tend to retard growth. Tax rates can be measured
directly with standard and readily available data, as in the new study.
<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, the quality of the judicial system in protecting property
rights and settling commercial disputes is also a structural characteristic
likely to influence economic growth. Unfortunately, there is no item in
the national accounts of a country that measures the efficiency, honesty
and predictability of the judiciary. However, one can consult the opinions
of key participants in the economy. <BR>
<BR>
For this reason, the competitiveness index is built upon the two pillars
of quantitative and survey data. The latter comes from a unique survey carried
out by the World Economic Forum of more than 2,000 business executives in
the 49 countries considered in the report. <BR>
<BR>
In the end, eight clusters of structural characteristics are employed which
we call the eight factors of competitiveness: openness of the economy to
international trade and finance; the role of the government budget and regulation;
development of financial markets; quality of infrastructure; quality of
technology; quality of business management; labour market flexibility and
quality of judicial and political institutions. <BR>
<BR>
A weighted average of indices of each of these structural characteristics
is taken to construct the single competitiveness index. Greatest weight
is given to the four factors with the strongest proven academic record of
explaining cross-country differences in growth, namely openness, government
budget and regulation, financial markets and labour markets. These four
factors are given a weight of three, infrastructure and technology a weight
of two and management and civil institutions a weight of one. Note that,
in general, this weighting corresponds to the percentage of quantitative
data in each of the factors; those with more quantitative data relative
to survey data have higher weight. <BR>
<BR>
The decision to give more importance to openness, finance, government and
labour is influenced by two considerations. First, academic studies of the
determinants of cross-country growth have found strong evidence for the
kinds of variables included in these factors, with different samples of
countries and with different time periods. <BR>
<BR>
Second, we have conducted our own statistical analysis of growth during
the most recent period (1992-1995) and have found these four factors to
be most strongly related to recent growth. <BR>
<BR>
In this way, an overall competitiveness index is arrived at. But the proof
of the pudding is in the eating. Does the index help to explain cross-country
patterns of economic growth? <BR>
<BR>
The answer is a resounding yes: competitiveness does matter. A nation's
economic policies - in world trade, finance, labour markets, judicial
reform and related areas - can have major effects on economic growth
on a sustained basis. The difference of good and bad economic policies can
amount to several percentage points of economic growth per year. One table
produced for the new report summarises the story. A scatter plot shows each
country's competitiveness rating and its rate of per capita economic growth
during 1993-95, looking at the relationship between competitiveness and
growth after controlling for each country's income level. <BR>
<BR>
The relationship is unmistakably positive: higher competitiveness, as measured
by the index, is strongly associated with more rapid economic growth. Statistical
significance means that the positive relationship is most likely not a random
accident of the data, in which just by chance the relationship is found
to be positive. <BR>
<BR>
The economic significance is even more important. It means that the differences
in economic growth attributed to differences in competitiveness are sizeable:
the gap between the most and least competitive countries in the sample,
Singapore and Brazil, is about 8.1% per year. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, the competitiveness index does not fully explain the cross-country
differences: for example, the growth in Malaysia and Singapore is higher
than predicted while in Switzerland and Luxembourg it is lower. <BR>
<BR>
There are several reasons for these discrepancies. For one thing, the underlying
theory of growth is imperfect to say the least. A single index cannot capture
all of the complex factors that contribute to growth. The weighting of the
underlying factors may be incorrect, any of the variables used are necessarily
measured with error or at least do not capture exactly what is needed and,
crucially, economies are subject to short-run shock of all types including
fluctuations in the terms of trade, domestic financial market movements
that may contribute to business cycles and so forth. The index is not geared
to capture these short-run movements. <BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, as a practical shorthand guide to business and government,
we think that the competitiveness index has considerable value, as long
as it is interpreted with such caveats in mind. <BR>
<BR>
Our biggest concern is with the weighting of the underlying variables. A
few key variables, such as the rates of taxation, government saving, relative
labour costs and openness to trade, may be relevant to long-term growth
but under-weighted compared with other variables of lesser signi&THORN;cance.
Future reports will address this problem. <BR>
<BR>
The bottom line on competitiveness is that national economic policies, an
effective judiciary, &thorn;exible labour markets and a stable political
system all make a profound difference to economic growth in the medium term.
<BR>
<BR>
Infrastructure, management and technology also contribute, though these
factors are much harder to measure and their effects much more elusive.
These basic facts are becoming increasingly appreciated: indeed, they are
helping to orient market reforms around the world, with greater or lesser
recognition in different places. <BR>
<BR>
Since good policies produce good outcomes and since countries surely compete
to obtain good outcomes, the quest for national competitiveness can be an
important stimulus for much- needed policy reforms in many economies around
the world. <BR>

<H2>WITH THE FORUM </H2>

CHICAGO: NOBEL LAUREATES 
<H2>The world is getting richer </H2>
The world's production is rising much faster than its population according
to Merton Miller, Professor Emeritus of Finance at the University of Chicago.
He was addressing the World Economic Forum's industry summit held in the
city, in a session called The Chicago Nobel Factory. <BR>
<BR>
Miller, himself a Nobel laureate, said that far from production outstripping
resources as many people worried, people were getting richer. His figures
show that before the 18th century both world population and production grew
at between 0% and +0.3%. During the 19th century production rose by 1% and
population by 0.5% <BR>
<BR>
In the first half of the 20th century, despite two world wars those rates
doubled to 2% for production and 1% for population. And from 1950-85, production
rose by 4.5% and population by 2%. <BR>
<BR>
Contributions from the other four Chicago University Nobel laureates present
included Robert Fogel's statement that a human being's upper age limit was
about 135 years and Ronald Coase's reminder to environmentalists that when
horses instead of cars filled London's streets, &quot;the number of flies
was quite extraordinary&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Fogel sought to put the discussion about economic growth into perspective:
&quot;<I>Homo sapiens</I> is only about 150,000 years old; we have only
had growth for the past 300 years. From the point of view of the human race,
there should be surprise at how fast [development] has happened.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
CHICAGO: PENSION REFORM 
<H2>The pension puzzle </H2>
A single middle-income American male who retired in 1970 received $25,000
more in social security than he contributed. By 2020 a man in the same circumstances
will have paid $88,000 more than he receives from the state, said Martin
Eichenbaum, an economics professor at Northwestern University, speaking
at a session on social security reform. <BR>
<BR>
Put another way, the US has a problem of implicit debt: add up all current
and future social security payments and total commitment amounts to 2.8
times GDP. Thomas Sargent of the University of Chicago said that to change
the system, debt would have to paid off by those in work before a new system
could be constructed. <BR>
<BR>
That would add the equivalent of 2% on income tax for a generation, making
this working generation suffer but the next far better off. Not only would
it cease to pay the 2% extra income tax, it could also be relieved of current
12% welfare contributions. Instead, workers would pay into a privately managed
personal scheme. <BR>
<BR>
Robert Gordon, chairman of the Northwestern economics department, gave some
examples. Using the social security system, an investment of $1,000 returned
$1,900. Using equities, the same return could be achieved from an investment
of just $250. He estimated that the cumulative effect of this investment
gap amounted to 10% of GDP. <BR>
<BR>
Yet the gains of privatising the system assume that the stock market continues
to perform as well as in the past. He said: &quot;The current rate of return
is 2%, but it is risk-free.&quot; If there were a major and sustained fall
in the rate of return, large sections of the population could be impoverished.
<BR>
<BR>
The panel kept returning to the difficulties of the present set-up. &quot;We
have higher rates of tax than we need now, in part to build up funds in
anticipation of the retirement of the baby-boomer generation,&quot; Gordon
said. The problems of the US system paled in comparison to those of Europe
and Japan, where population growth and immigration are even lower, leaving
fewer taxpayers to support the growing community of old people. <BR>
<BR>
At least part of the problem was the increase in life expectancy. &quot;Life
expectancy has gone up dramatically since the system began, but there has
been no increase in the retirement age to match,&quot; Eichenbaum said.
<BR>
<BR>
CHICAGO: CANCER 
<H2>Bombers or magic bullets? </H2>
Progress in biological understanding has been as great as advances of the
Industrial Revolution and half of all cancers are now curable, leading Chicago
University oncologist Samuel Hellman told the industry summit session &quot;Is
Cancer Curable?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But Steven Rosen, director of the Lurie cancer centre at Northwestern University,
said that his experiences made him less optimistic than 10 years before.
He said the term cancer covered more than 100 diseases and incidence was
rising in the US, along with an ageing population. There would be modest
improvements in prevention, but no magic bullet cure. <BR>
<BR>
A more optimistic Glenn Steele said that within five years there should
be more understanding of growth control. Ralph Weichselbaum pointed out
that the key to tackling cholera in 19th-century London had been the chance
discovery of a link with plumbing. &quot;We may have [curative] drugs now
without yet knowing how to use them. This fight needs the sort of commitment
we put into the military.&quot; He said the cost of a B-1 bomber equals
that of the US's annual cancer budget. <BR>
<BR>
Rosen said there might soon be a blood test for colon cancer, &quot;but
then the insurance companies are going to fight like hell not to insure
those people&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Asked about the prospects for new approaches such as gene therapy, Steele
suggested that there had been &quot;a certain natural process of over-selling&quot;
by people looking for grant money to fund research. <BR>
<BR>
SOUTHERN AFRICA: PRIVATISATION 
<H2>Utilities begin at home </H2>
Delegates at the Southern Africa Economic Summit in Cape Town in May were
treated to a fiery attack on South African government policy by Sam Shilowa,
general secretary of the trade union congress Cosatu, in the plenary session
on privatisation. Plans to privatise the main utility companies have been
delayed, partly because of union opposition. <BR>
<BR>
Shilowa spoke strongly against the privatisation project, just as president
Nelson Mandela gave it his firm backing during a visit to Bonn. &quot;We
are told we have to privatise the utilities because there is not enough
capacity. But telecoms, transport, electricity are delivered to whites and...
now Transtel supplies Zaire. Why should my money pay for Zaire?&quot; he
said in an outburst. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;My mother has no electricity in her home: the government cannot give
it to her. She still carries bundles of wood on her head. I don't want some
theory, I want someone to explain.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Finance minister Trevor Manuel said he could not believe that Cosatu was
so emphatically opposed to privatisation under all circumstances and argued
that it did bring efficiency gains. <BR>
<BR>
SOUTH AFRICA: DE KLERK 
<H2>De Klerk on life in opposition </H2>
Frederik De Klerk, the former deputy president of South Africa who recently
took his National Party out of the coalition government, spoke to participants
of the Forum's summit for the first time as a member of the opposition.
<BR>
<BR>
Explaining the move, he said the new constitution had no provision for power-sharing,
making a government of national unity an anachronism. &quot;We must achieve
a healthy and dynamic multi-party system. Otherwise we could drift into
a one-party state,&quot; he said. &quot;We will be a vigorous but responsible
opposition, more effective by adopting a critical role than by operating
behind the scenes.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Questioned about union leader Sam Shilowa's opposition to privatisation,
De Klerk pressed home his party's case, arguing that there were internal
divisions in the ruling ANC alliance.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are those such as Mandela who feel a sense of urgency, but others
are afraid to put their foot down,&quot; he said. &quot;If privatisation
could be done easily in any country, it is in South Africa. Two years ago
we were ready to move very fast. All state companies had... achieved a degree
of autonomy [and] were operating in the market as if private.&quot; Instead
of acting quickly, the government set up teams to analyse privatisation
candidates. &quot;The process was logical, but it took too long,&quot; he
said. <BR>
<BR>
De Klerk also criticised the government's handling of the rand crisis and
its labour policy, which treads softly on union sensibilities. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There is a need for a social pact [to contain crime] and a need for
flexible labour,&quot; he said. &quot;The country's biggest problem is unemployment.
We cannot over-protect the employed at the cost of the unemployed.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
There were questions about how the National Party (NP), with its legacy
of apartheid rule, would overcome the ethnic divide in South African politics
and appeal more to other groups. De Klerk said that more than half of all
NP voters were non-white, mainly from the Coloured or Asian communities.
The party was also targeting black ANC supporters. &quot;We are looking
at five to six million black South Africans to change their allegiance.
A new institute for political leadership is looking for young talent [and]
we will have a well-balanced list of candidates, reflecting the make-up
of the whole nation,&quot; he said. <BR>
<BR>
SOUTHERN AFRICA: INDIAN OCEAN RIM 
<H2>A new region is born </H2>
Mauritius came into the limelight at Cape Town in a session on the Indian
Ocean Rim (IOR). The island took the initiative in helping to set up an
IOR regional grouping that would comprise 14 of the 30 countries bordering
the Indian Ocean. A draft charter was approved in May. The group will have
a secretariat and will operate by consensus. <BR>
<BR>
Mauritian foreign minister PR Berenger said that the IOR grouping was not
a utopia but a vast new market in the making. He said Mauritius believes
the initiative complements the Southern Africa Development Community. <BR>
<BR>
Berenger said that groups representing government, private companies and
universities have met to discuss trade, transport and technology since a
March 1995 intergovernmental meeting. It was decided to include only sovereign
states but some entities may be allowed observer status. <BR>
<BR>
Berenger said Mauritius was well placed to coordinate the initiative because
it had modern facilities and was a member of both the English-speaking Commonwealth
and Francophonie. But Ronnie Bethlehem, representing South Africa on the
trade committee of the Nedlac regional grouping, said the aim was &quot;regional
integration without domination&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Gavin Maasdorp, director of the University of Natal's economic research
unit, echoed the potential benefits. &quot;With trade blocs, too many countries
join without doing the necessary homework on costs and benefits. This is
loose grouping like Asean when it started. Each country has some competitive
advantage that it can exploit.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
When asked if the focus of South African trade would shift from Europe to
Asia, Maasdorp said trade patterns would not change overnight. Despite the
development of a culture in South Africa more oriented to the Third World,
trade with Europe was sticking at 46% of the total. <BR>
<BR>
Trade with countries of the Indian Ocean Rim is rising from 2.8% 1990 to
8.8% in 1994, mostly with east Africa, but the increase may partly reflect
trade that used to be disguised under anti-apartheid sanctions, Maasdorp
said. <BR>
<BR>
Maasdorp argued that the 13 landlocked countries that depend on IOR ports
should join the grouping. Berenger felt this was unrealistic. &quot;Where
do we stop? We started with seven countries and moved up to 14. We decided
to stop there and show concrete results before becoming bigger.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
MERCOSUR ECONOMIC SUMMIT 
<H2>Presidents together again </H2>
Six presidents were the highlight of the World Economic Forum's second Mercosur
Economic Summit, held in Buenos Aires in June. At the end of the summit's
first full day, presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, Carlos Sa&uacute;l
Menem of Argentina, Juan Carlos Wasmosy of Paraguay and Julio Mar&iacute;a
Sanguinetti of Uruguay together declared their faith in the benefits of
Mercosur, the trade grouping of the four nations. <BR>
<BR>
To close the summit, presidents Eduardo Frei of Chile and Gonzalo S&aacute;nchez
de Lozada of Bolivia, whose countries are joining Mercosur as associate
members, reaffirmed the region's dramatic changes: the Chile/Bolivia relationship
was once characterised by wars and sabre-rattling rather than smiles and
handshakes. <BR>
<BR>
Menem said Mercosur gives member nations the ability &quot;to do collectively
what we cannot do individually&quot;. Cardoso was more explicit: &quot;In
the next millennium we want to be actors. We want to be at the negotiating
tables. For this we have to be together.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The optimism and warmth between the presidents contrasted sharply with the
mood of the first Mercosur Economic Summit, held in June last year in S&atilde;o
Paulo. Then, Brazil and Argentina were rowing over auto production and exports.
Cardoso dismissed the affair: &quot;It was not a crisis. It was a little
problem that [Menem and I] solved over lunch at the summit.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
All of the presidents looked forward to building on Mercosur's achievements
in increasing intra-regional trade. They agreed that improved transport
infrastructure was a priority to realise the dream of linking Chile's access
to the Pacific, through Paraguay and Bolivia, to the Atlantic access of
Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. <BR>
<BR>
Comparisons with Mercosur's major trade and investment partner, the EU,
were frequent. Leaders of the five-year old Mercosur emphasised that the
EU has had 40 years to reach its present level of integration. However,
all of the presidents were adamant that the Latin American regional grouping
would develop without the formation of an EU-like bureaucracy. <HR>

Corp </I><BR>
<BR>
&quot;I've allowed minister Stella Sigcau to overstep her time because it
is important for you to hear directly from her. Besides, she is my boss.&quot;<BR>
<I>Saki Macozoma, deputy managing director of Transnet, South Africa</I>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We do discuss problems with the banking sector, but moral suasion
does not work very well when you have up to 50 banks competing with each
other.&quot;<BR>
<I>Christian Stals, governor of South Africa's reserve bank, on the recent
rand crisis</I> <BR>
<BR>
&quot;When we export raw materials to the developed world, we never have
any problems. When we export anything with added value, there are always
problems.&quot;<BR>
<I>Eduardo Frei, president of Chile</I> <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There will be problems. But if we didn't have problems, what would
we be doing as politicians?&quot; <I>Fernando Henrique Cardoso, president
of Brazil</I> <BR>

<H2>REVIEW</H2>

<H3>Polemical theory </H3>
Pop Internationalism <BR>
<BR>
By Paul Krugman <BR>
MIT Press, &#163;14.95<B> </B>and $22.50 <BR>
<BR>
<I>Reviewed by Paul Hirst</I> <BR>
<BR>
Paul Krugman is a leading international trade theorist and an accomplished
polemicist. In this collection of essays he uses both these skills to tackle
some of his favourite <I>b&ecirc;tes noires</I> which are already familiar
to readers of this magazine, especially the idea of comparing national performance
in competitiveness rankings (see page 14 and <I>World Link</I>, September/October
1995). <BR>
<BR>
Krugman is determined to challenge the myth of trade as national competition
and he puts up a very good and useful fight. It is a shame, therefore, that
although each essay reads well on its own the collective impact is repetitive:
the book could have done with a good deal of editing. <BR>
<BR>
His main target is the prevalent idea that in a globalising economic system
modern industrial nations - like corporations - are engaged in
a competitive struggle for shares of world trade and winners can only succeed
at the expense of losers. The key aim of government policy, therefore, must
be to promote the country's &quot;competitiveness&quot;. Such rhetoric spans
the political spectrum: some, like Ross Perot, think foreign competition
destroys jobs and the only antidote is protectionist tariffs while others,
like Lester Thurow, propose active industrial policies. <BR>
<BR>
Krugman is opposed to both sides and hammers home the thesis that the enlargement
of markets through the reduction of trade barriers will promote growth and
overall prosperity. Along the way, his opponents are dismissed as either
economic illiterates or as people blinded by their beliefs. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately this means he can be excessively polemical and unfair, especially
when he poses as the poor sidelined economics professor who just happens
to be right. In fact his belief in gains from trade is mainstream and has
driven the two great recent moves toward trade liberalisation, the Single
Market of the EU and the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT.
Someone must be listening. <BR>
<BR>
Lester Thurow in particular does not merit the ridicule he receives here.
Krugman is violently opposed to the US Democratic Party sympathisers who
advocate a strategic trade and industrial policy. In part the difference
stems from the degree of confidence in the free market. Thurow has long
argued that markets alone will not guarantee a productive economy and looked
for ways to reverse the very domestic processes of slow growth and investment
decline in the US that Krugman himself acknowledges as a problem. <BR>
<BR>
Krugman marshals a mass of empirical evidence to prove his argument about
free trade, making fools of its more naive opponents. Thus Nafta was supposed
to result in the loss of thousands of jobs to Mexico and threaten US wage
levels for unskilled work. However tariffs on manufactured goods were already
low (4%), which logically should have already led to the large-scale collapse
of American employment. The truth is that the Mexican minnow was never big
enough to alter US wage levels to any serious extent. <BR>
<BR>
His main point in these essays is that firms, not nations, are competitive.
A firm has to sell all its output, in other words to &quot;export&quot;.
Nations export only a fraction of their output and many goods and services
are not tradable on world markets. Nations have options that companies do
not. Countries can devalue and thus change the terms of trade and generally
have a comparative advantage in some sectors. <BR>
<BR>
In the main, Krugman says, jobs are not being lost in the advanced world
because of import penetration: the scale of losses is too big for that.
The cause is closer to home, from productivity gains and the increasing
relative importance of services. He also argues that Third World industrialisation
is not hurting First World prosperity. <BR>
<BR>
Exports of manufactured goods from newly industrialising countries still
represent a tiny fraction of the developed world's GDP, just 1.2% in 1990.
Wages in successful nations such as South Korea are rising rapidly and offer
the prospect of a win-win outcome in which newly affluent Asian consumers
create large markets for western goods and services. <BR>
<BR>
Krugman insists that advanced countries should neither fear a massive loss
of jobs and output to low-wage countries nor drive down wages to compete
with Third World workers, most of whose activities cannot be traded internationally.
Jakarta barbers cannot displace those in New Jersey. <BR>
<BR>
Whatever its limits in dealing with industrial and technology policy, Krugman's
analysis should help to dispel some western fears about international competition
and the threat of low-wage countries. But free trade is not a panacea: only
an elite of non-western countries are prospering and benefiting from foreign
investment. We need other policies to address the fact that the world remains
distressingly divided between rich and poor nations. 
<H2>Red revolution </H2>
Tell Newt To Shut Up <BR>
<BR>
By David Maraniss and Michael Weisskopf <BR>
Simon &amp; Schuster, $10 <BR>
<BR>
<I>Reviewed by Emily Spencer</I> <BR>
<BR>
At the beginning of his political career, Newt Gingrich was so desperate
to run the Republican Party's long-term planning department that he was
forever bombarding it with policy suggestions. The running joke was that
staff had a wall of filing cabinets full of Newt's Ideas and only a solitary
cabinet of Newt's Good Ideas. <BR>
<BR>
Whatever else might be said about the man who two years ago took control
of the US House of Representatives, his Contract with America, by which
Gingrich promised to change the relationship between rulers and ruled, was
a good idea. Even if it turns out to have been a disaster in the longer
term (polls suggest the Democrats will win the congressional vote in November)<B>,</B>
the contract was credited with returning the House to Republican control
for the first time in 40 years. <BR>
<BR>
Yet the supposed architect of this triumph is an ambiguous figure in the
minds of many Republicans. The title of this book is an echo of the message
sent to the House speaker by Republicans worried by his apparently endless
stream of public gaffes. <BR>
<BR>
This is Newt's story, but it is far more than that. It is also a book about
his allies, the congressmen imbued with a near-fanatical loathing for government
interference. It is a tale of Washington's inside-outsiders; the representatives
of a party long denied congressional power who plotted and planned and then
blew their big chance. <BR>
<BR>
But it is also a book in the best traditions of American journalism. The
project is a detailed, carefully researched, well-written and revealing
account of the new Republican Party's attempt at a constitutional revolution.
<I>Washington Post</I> reporters David Maraniss and Michael Weisskopf conducted
more than 300 interviews and drew on many other primary sources. Occasionally,
the large cast of characters is confusing for those whose knowledge of the
subject is less than encyclopaedic. <BR>
<BR>
The Republicans were fixated by the need to roll back government, but they
soon found themselves in deep water. Planning to slash the budgets of regulatory
bodies overseeing safety at work and the environment, they allowed business
lobbyists to hijack the legislative drafting process and in the process
forgot the little guy so central to their own rhetoric. As a result, at
least some of those little guys will be voting Democrat this autumn. <BR>
<BR>
Still more divisive were plans to reduce welfare programmes such as the
Medicare healthcare scheme for the elderly and the school lunch programme
that provides the only nutritious meal of the day for many children in the
southern US. <BR>
<BR>
This last issue was an unmitigated public relations disaster, according
to the authors. It was also the moment when the Republican revolution exposed
its flank to the Democrats. The incomers have suffered ever since from variations
on the Democrat theme that Gingrich and Co were taking food from needy children
to finance tax cuts for the rich. This was compounded by Gingrich's unerring
ability to seek out a political accident and fall victim to it. He claimed
that drug abuse was commonplace at the White House, insulted Hillary Clinton
and re&thorn;ected that orphanages might be expanded to slow America's social
disintegration. <BR>
<BR>
At the heart of it all was Newt, ruefully discovering that winning power
is one thing and keeping it another. He had to transform himself from a
firebrand who stoked up the Republican revolution to a sober political negotiator.
This was, and remains, a painful and incomplete metamorphosis. <BR>
<BR>
Although Gingrich was initially a dealmaker between his party's moderates
and right-wingers, he increasingly lost influence as disagreements with
the Clinton administration over the budget brought congress to a halt. <BR>
<BR>
At the start of last year commentators were speculating that Gingrich might
run for president. No longer. Yet the book still offers a valuable insight
into the Republican Party and its factions, whatever happens in November.
<H2>Asia's nanny state </H2>
The Missionary and the Libertine: Love and War in East and West <BR>
<BR>
By Ian Buruma<BR>
Faber and Faber, &#163;16.99 <BR>
<BR>
<I>Reviewed by Anthony Hyman</I> <BR>
<BR>
Singapore has just passed a law giving its aged citizens the right to financial
help from their offspring. It is another aspect of what author Ian Buruma
calls the Nanny State of Asia, whose peculiarities are sketched adeptly,
as is its long-time leader, Lee Kuan Yew. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Harry&quot; Lee actually used to describe himself as an Anglicised
Chinaman. Now, along with other authoritarian figures in the region, he
espouses Asian values, numbing the free expression of the otherwise fortunate
and prosperous citizens of the island state. <BR>
<BR>
Old clich&eacute;s about east and west have been dramatically reversed with
the rise of Asia's economic tigers. It is no longer the east that is usually
thought of as indolent and decadent compared with a disciplined and puritanical
west. Instead, western politicians loudly praise it for its superior discipline
and industriousness. Buruma argues that for many people in China, Japan,
Singapore, Malaysia and South Korea, &quot;Europe and the United States
are now models not of masculine vim but... of decadence, libertinism and
sloth&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Cultural interaction has been going on for many generations. It was European
literature, after all, that liberated love for the Japanese, with romantic
love becoming for the first time a serious subject for writers. Yet the
sex, violence or cruelty so common in Japanese entertainment is, in some
cases, a sign of political desperation. The popular appetite for sexual
fantasy in Japanese literature is &quot;the institutionalised escape from
an oppressive society&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Buruma, who lived and worked for a long time in Asia, surveys the scene
with a shrewd eye. Thus Tokyo comes to life as a city where the machine
age becomes somehow human. <BR>
<BR>
The sinister link between nation-building and sports is illuminated here.
South Korea craves recognition as a great nation, writes Buruma, and gold
medals at the Seoul Olympics and other sports events satisfy this yearning.
The pressure on Korean athletes is cruel but effective, as it was in communist
East Germany. The downside is that the nationalistic state media often fosters
xenophobia in its sports coverage, hampering any opening of Korean society.
<BR>
<BR>
On to the Philippines and Imelda Marcos, who felt very sincerely that the
US had betrayed the Marcos regime. South Asia is included too in portraits
of two Indian intellectuals, filmmaker Satyajit Ray and Nirad Chaudhuri,
and of Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto and her populist politics. <BR>

The complex, often tortured relationship between east and west has a sensitive
interpreter in Buruma. His book shows clearly that myths are pervasive and
have a life of their own. A residue of western clich&eacute;s about the
inscrutable east dating from the age of imperialism still persist in popular
novels, even in more sophisticated thrillers such as the best-seller <I>Rising
Sun</I> by Michael Crichton. <BR>
<BR>
The historical burden also colours US-Japanese relations, still haunted
by the ghosts of Pearl Harbour and Hiroshima. In the US there are also the
professional Cassandras with their visions of doom. &quot;On the subject
of American decline, they tend to sound like French nationalists after losing
the war with Prussia in 1871. It is as though the virility of the nation
were at stake,&quot; Buruma writes. If Asian writers and publicists reciprocate
in kind with their own myths about the west, it is because we each seem
to need the alien other.<BR>

In 1985 Conrad Black, the Canadian businessman,  took over The Daily Telegraph
and became a British newspaper proprietor. Soon afterwards, as Richard Siklos
writes in &quot;Shades of Black, Conrad Black and the world's fastest growing
press empire&quot; (Heinemann, &#163;20), a letter from Black to The Spectator
went some way to revealing the views of the new man. Black's target was
the liberal journalist Christopher Hitchens, who had written a piece on
Ronald Reagan's state of health. Black declared that readers deserved &quot;better
than Hitchens's nasty, macabre, vulgar and insolent claptrap&quot;. He also
knocked the British press corps in Washington for its &quot;habitually snobbish&quot;
reports on the US. <BR>
<BR>
Black arrived in the UK unknown and with little more than three university
degrees, a string of small newspapers and a sharp tongue. (Black described
the author of an unkind review of his biography of former Quebec premier
Maurice Duplessis as having the &quot;professional ethics of a cockroach&quot;.)
<BR>
<BR>
Siklos kindly describes Black as &quot;hyperliterate&quot;, an indication
of the biographer's treatment of his subject. The book was written with
Black's cooperation and Siklos works for a newspaper part-owned by Black.
<BR>
<BR>
Black is a man both intimidating and serious, with a passion for military
history and Napoleon Bonaparte. He is depicted as dull at times, but consistent.
He has always railed against the left and successfully pursued wealth. During
the '60s, while others his age indulged in the liberal politics of the &thorn;ower
generation, Black spurned their paci&THORN;sm and clothing: he wore a three-piece,
pinstripe suit. <BR>
<BR>
Long before this, he had shown a cheerful disregard for what interested
other children. As a boy, Siklos relates, Black washed dollar bills in soap
and water and hung them to dry. Despite these anecdotes, the book lacks
colour: this is far from a searching insight into Black's character or his
motives. <BR>
<BR>
Siklos's excessively detailed description of Black's business activities
fails to compensate. He traces their development from early ventures in
Canada and his penetration of the US business community to the moment he
became a true press tycoon in 1985. <BR>
<BR>
The author's most lucid business account is of Black's acquisition of the
Telegraph papers from the Berry family in 1985-86, showing how unprepared
the old feudal set-up was to deal with such a determined predator. <BR>
<BR>
The book succeeds in portraying Black as a man of qualities. The author
points out that his subject knows more about 19th-century British politics
than Lady Thatcher. When Black told Thatcher that her reforms were more
important than the regicide of Charles I and the unceremonious disposal
of James II during the Glorious Revolution, the &thorn;attered prime minister
replied: &quot;That is very good, Mr Black. Do come back.&quot;

<H2>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM, INSIGHTS </H2>
<IMG SRC="images/wl.96.04.12.gif" WIDTH="91" HEIGHT="78"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The World Economic Forum is today the foremost international membership
organization integrating leaders from business, government and academia
into a partnership committed to improving the state of the world. Through
global, ef&THORN;cient, direct, personalized and highest-level interaction,
the World Economic Forum serves its members and constituents to de&THORN;ne
their agenda for action. The core community of the World Economic Forum
are the 1,000 foremost global companies. <BR>
<BR>
Incorporated since 1971 as a foundation, the World Economic Forum is independent,
impartial and not-for-pro&THORN;t, tied to no political, partisan or national interests.
It has consultative status with the United Nations. The motto of the World
Economic Forum is &quot;Entrepreneurship in the global public interest&quot;.

<H3>Membership News </H3>
Members of the World Economic Forum are not individuals but companies, which
are represented at the highest level of management. Each member should be
characterised by:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>its global dimension or the strategy to grow in that direction 
  <LI>a top management that is forward-looking and of high reputation 
  <LI>a healthy organization - respected, growing and ethical. 
</UL>
<BR>
The World Economic Forum currently has two categories of membership: <BR>
<BR>
<B>Foundation Membership</B> <BR>
<BR>
In principle, Foundation membership is made up of the 1,000 foremost global
enterprises. In addition to the above general criteria, each is characterised
by the following speci&THORN;c attributes: 
<UL>
  <LI>a  signi&THORN;cant role in shaping the future of its industry and/or
region 
  <LI>the ability and willingness of its top management to contribute to
international cooperation and economic and social progress. 
</UL>
<BR>
<B>Global Growth Company Membership</B> <BR>
<BR>
Global Growth Companies are some of the world's fastest-growing business
groups. Each is characterised by the following speci&THORN;c attributes:
<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>a signi&THORN;cant role in shaping its industry as a niche producer,
a technological leader or an entrepreneurial innovator 
  <LI>the ability and willingness of its top management to network with
like-minded enterprises around the world. 
</UL>
<BR>
In order to integrate the advice of its members into the decision-making
process of the Foundation, the Council of the World Economic Forum has been
established. <BR>
<BR>
In 1996 the Council, presided by George Mallinckrodt, is composed of Rahul
Bajaj, Franco Bernab&eacute;, John H. Bryan, Hubert Burda, T. Neal Chapman,
Ronnie C. Chan, Bertrand Collomb, Oscar Fanjul, Hermann O. Franz, M. Sha&THORN;k
Gabr, Joseph T. Gorman, Cor A.J. Herkstroter, Jaakko V.A. Ihamuotila, E.
Neville Isdell, Donald R. Keough, Nemir A. Kirdar, Yoh Kurosawa, J. Martin
K. Laing, Gernot A. Langes-Swarovski, Kenneth L. Lay, Arne Martensson, Yuzaburo
Mogi, Minoru Murofushi, Masafumi Ohnishi, John B. Prescott, James J. Schiro,
Christopher A. Sinclair, Sarik Tara, Paulo D. Villares, John Zabriskie and
Lorenzo H. Zambrano. It re&thorn;ects an optimal sectoral and regional representation
of members. 
<H3>Industry Summit </H3>
Chicago, 12-15 May <BR>
<BR>
Globalization was again a theme on the working agenda of the World Economic
Forum's Regional Summits. At the Industry Summit in Chicago on 12-15 May,
500 global business leaders, experts and policymakers gathered to discuss
global business concerns ranging from the reform of the social security
system to management-related issues. <BR>
<BR>
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, National Economic Adviser to the President of the
United States, opened the meeting on 12 May at the University of Chicago
by saying that history has shown that when internationalism has prevailed
over protectionism and isolationism in US foreign economic policy, both
the US and international market have bene&THORN;ted. She said it was the
policy of the Clinton administration to compete and not retreat, and to
keep the &THORN;scal house in order while bringing down international barriers.
<BR>
<BR>
Asked by Klaus Schwab, President of the World Economic Forum, what issues
are the most crucial in the not-too-distant future, Tyson said that technology
and globalization have exacerbated differences in income and in opportunities
both between countries and between individuals within countries to such
an extent that the biggest challenge will be to empower those who feel threatened
by change. <BR>
<BR>
Set in Chicago, at the heart of the world's largest domestic market, the
three-day meeting brought together industry leaders from 40 countries to
contribute to sector-speci&THORN;c discussions in &THORN;nancial services,
energy, health and seven other industries. Participants also welcomed the
opportunity to present their views on the liberalization of the &THORN;nancial
services industries as being negotiated in the WTO at this point in time
during a seminar between leaders of EU and US &THORN;nancial services industries
and top of&THORN;cials of the EU Commission and US Treasury Department.
The meeting provided an opportunity to begin to identify practical ways
of collaboration between the US and European &THORN;nancial services sectors.
<BR>
<BR>
Held at the University of Chicago and Northwestern University, the meeting
proved that a real dynamic can take place between academia and business.
Some 40 CEOs and entrepreneurs from the Chicago Inc establishment participated
in the 70 working sessions and worked together as a host committee alongside
almost a hundred alumni to help put together the event. <BR>
<BR>
On the second day, &THORN;ve out of the last six Nobel Laureates in Economics,
who have all come from the University of Chicago's distinguished faculty,
formed a panel chaired by Hugo Sonnenschein, President of the University
of Chicago, to address issues in leadership, motivation and the questioning
of the status quo. They were Gary S. Becker, (1992 Laureate), Ronald H.
Coase (1991 Laureate), Robert W. Fogel (1993 Laureate), Robert E. Lucas
Jr (1995 Laureate) and Merton H. Miller (1990 Laureate). 
<H3>Turkey Meeting </H3>
Ankara <BR>
<BR>
18-19 April <BR>
<BR>
A few weeks earlier, the World Economic Forum held a timely meeting in Turkey
between 150 international and Turkish senior executives and key political
&THORN;gures of the new coalition government. <BR>
<BR>
After months of a political vacuum, Turkey's government was keen to discuss
its economic programme with the international business community and to
restore con&THORN;dence in the country's future economic potential, said
Frederic Sicre, Member of the Executive Board and Coordinator of the Turkey
Meeting. <BR>
<BR>
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz opened the meeting in Ankara on 18 April speaking
on the future political, economic and social stability in Turkey. Several
ministers and leaders of the opposition including Necmettin Erbakan, Chairman
of the Welfare Party, also participated. Animated discussions punctuated
the two-day meeting between government and business leaders. Following are
excerpts from the concrete recommendations put together by the participants
for the Turkish government to help it determine an action plan for Turkey's
future economic priorities: <BR>
<DL>
  <DD>In the preparation for Customs Union: 
</DL>
<UL>
  <LI>Customs Union negotiations have reached a delicate stage. Short- and
medium-term goals need to be reviewed and prioritized so as to be more proactive.
  <LI>Rules and regulations on trade need to be synchronized with EU directives
as much as possible. 
  <LI>Imports into Turkey are slowed by the mandatory inspection by the
Ministry of Health. Turkish customs of&THORN;cer need to be better trained
as to developments in EU-Turkey trade. 
</UL>
<DL>
  <DD>In privatization: 
</DL>
<UL>
  <LI>need to clearly de&THORN;ne and communicate Government objectives
  <LI>empower the Privatization Administration to carry out the privatization
programme effectively and ef&THORN;ciently over the next three to four years.
Assign one strong privatization leader. 
  <LI>Build trust with national and international investors through transparent
decision processes and decision criteria and address unavoidable social
aspects 
  <LI>Prioritize all companies in the privatization portfolio according
to government priorities and market interest. 
</UL>
<DL>
  <DD>In &THORN;nancial services: 
</DL>
<UL>
  <LI>Harmonization of taxation on &THORN;nancial instruments and reduction
of the costs associated with &THORN;nancial transactions on foreign exchange,
money and capital markets; lowering of stamp duties; and lowering of reserve
requirements 
  <LI>The establishment of specialized courts to deal with &THORN;nancial
cases. Set up a regulatory framework for factoring 
  <LI>Limiting the unfair competition provided by state-owned banks 
</UL>
<DL>
  <DD>In manufacturing: 
</DL>
<UL>
  <LI>Implementation of an in&thorn;ation accounting system 
  <LI>Lowering high real interest rates to help capital investment. 
</UL>
<BR>
Although foreign and Turkish participants showed concern with the present
political situation, they seemed con&THORN;dent that in the medium- to long-term
Turkey's key advantages in terms of its sheer size and quality of its workforce
will allow it to become an important bridge between Asia and Europe. Already,
strong links have developed between Turkey and Russia, said one of Turkey's
leading businessman Rahmi Koc. <BR>

<H3>Future Meetings</H3>
<H3>Central and East European Economic Summit </H3>
Salzburg 7-9 July <BR>
<BR>
For years, the World Economic Forum has pioneered the opening of the countries
of this area and their integration into the global economy. Now, the World
Economic Forum welcomes the international business community to the &THORN;rst
Central and East European Economic Summit under the patronage of President
Thomas Klestil of Austria. <BR>
<BR>
The focus of the Summit is on the countries of the region and their neighbours
- Austria, Germany and Russia - and will stress the importance
of the region as a whole in the wider European context. It will point to
the need to develop both the infrastructure and the business links capable
of raising local capital, attracting foreign investment and promoting trade
and industry. We also will look closely at the thrust towards European integration
and the search for collective security arrangements. 
<H3>1996 Asia Summits </H3>
<B>Three exceptional Summits this autumn will bring businessmen up to date
on the latest economic, &THORN;nancial and business developments taking
place in the most dynamic part of the world.</B> <BR>
<BR>
<B>China Business Summit</B> <BR>
<BR>
Beijing <BR>
<BR>
16-18 September <BR>
<BR>
Bolstered by a sustained period of growth, China must now contain in&thorn;ationary
pressures and rein in the development of some of its most successful provinces.
Our Summit will address the most salient questions related to this new phase
of economic maturity and help foreign investors position themselves in the
newly reshaped environment. As the handover of Hong Kong approaches, participants
may also be able to assess China's new role on the world's economic scene
and its position among other markets in the Asia-Paci&THORN;c region. <BR>
<BR>
Senior government of&THORN;cials, top Chinese and foreign experts, Chinese
business leaders, as well as senior executives from companies involved in
China will be the key discussion partners during the Summit, held in partnership
with the China Enterprise Management Association (CEMA) under the patronage
of the State Economic and Trade Commission. <BR>
<BR>
<B>India Economic Summit</B> <BR>
<BR>
New Delhi <BR>
<BR>
27-29 October <BR>
<BR>
Following India's June elections our Summit will be a unique opportunity
to meet with key members of the new cabinet and thus help to relieve foreign
investors' uncertainties concerning the future course of liberalization.
<BR>
<BR>
Two key issues to be addressed at the Summit (held in partnership with the
Confederation of Indian Industry, CII) will be identifying new opportunities
for partnerships and cooperation and improving the environment for domestic
and foreign companies as the Indian economy builds on current strong results,
especially in the industrial sector. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Europe/East Asia Economic Summit</B> <BR>
<BR>
Hong Kong <BR>
<BR>
18-20 November <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Partnership in Growth&quot;: the &THORN;fth Europe/East Asia Economic
Summit (held in partnership with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council)
will re&thorn;ect the enhanced business, trade, &THORN;nancial and technological
ties between these two industrialized poles and will thus constitute a business
complement to this year's government summit. Given the backing of EU governments,
European enterprises are now gearing up for overseas expansion in an effort
to boost their competitiveness in Asia. The Summit programme will draw attention
to some new trends in Asian investment in Europe. As the Summit will be
the last opportunity for high-level discussions before the WTO ministerial
meeting in Singapore, trade issues will feature prominently on the agenda.

<H2>TECHNOLOGY</H2>

<H4>Competition is growing in the world of industrial espionage as official
spooks get into an old business </H4>
<H3>Spies like U.S. </H3>
An American businessman went to France a few years ago for negotiations
with a leading company. At a meeting with his French opposite numbers, the
man was appalled to see that they had a copy of his papers, complete with
the notes he had made in his hotel room the night before. In the ensuing
confrontation, the French admitted they had been given the document by government
agents<B>.</B> <BR>
<BR>
This widely reported story may seem apocryphal but it illustrates the ease
with which competitors can obtain con&THORN;dential information. Of course,
industrial espionage is as old as the hills. But according to some experts
the problem is growing. <BR>
<BR>
A new<B> </B>study by the American Society for Industrial Security suggests
that US companies lose $2 billion a month as a result of espionage, often
by foreign governments. In the colourful words of US Senator Arlen Specter,
chairman of the senate intelligence committee: &quot;We are being skinned
alive by foreigners who use cut- throat practices to steal our secrets.
That's taking away a lot of American jobs.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
There are three reasons for this possible growth in spying. Firstly, with
the fall of the Iron Curtain intelligence agencies have been forced to reinvent
themselves and commercial espionage is an obvious route. This is confirmed
by Wayne Madson, a computer security specialist based in North Virginia,
who has worked for US security organisations. &quot;The huge intelligence
community now has to justify its existence. Its large in-built infrastructure
needs to find something to do,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
A second and related point is that any growth in industrial espionage will
be matched by an equal or greater growth in industrial counter-espionage.
Growth in the spy world fuels itself and gives spies a reason to exaggerate
the extent of the problem. In the US, estimates of the cost to business
vary from $24 billion up to $100 billion a year. But it probably makes sense
to view such estimates with a degree of scepticism. In the US, they have
just helped prise a cool $30 billion from congress this year, a surprisingly
high &THORN;gure considering the end of the Cold War and intense pressure
for budget cuts. <BR>
<BR>
Part of the money has gone towards bee&THORN;ng up counter-espionage departments:
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), for example, set up an Economic
Counterintelligence programme in 1994. However there is an ongoing debate
among intelligence circles over whether the state should &THORN;nance spying
on foreign firms to get information for US business. On one hand, it is
argued that this will help the US economy to remain competitive and anyway,
other countries do it. But someone has to define which firms are domestic
or foreign, an increasingly dif&THORN;cult thing to do in a globalised economy,
and then discriminate by deciding which US company deserves to get this
information. For France and other countries with a large state-owned sector
the dilemma is less acute. <BR>
<BR>
The former director of French intelligence, Pierre Marion, was quoted as
telling an American audience: &quot;In economics, we are competitors not
allies. America has the most technical information... it is easily accessible.
So naturally your country will receive most [attention] from intelligence
services.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
There have been several disputes between the US and Paris. The French secret
service allegedly bugged the conversations of US businessmen on airline
flights. Last year, France responded with accusations that US agents tried
to recruit French corporate and government officials. Some press reports
suggested they were after sophisticated France Telecom technology for use
on the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
The third reason for the growth in industrial espionage is the advance of
technology, making equipment cheaper and easier to use. There is now an
entire industry supplying the needs of would-be executive spies and high
street shops offer many of the tools of the trade. According to the <I>Washington
Post</I>, this gadget industry is worth $100 million a year. While it is
illegal to sell bugging equipment to the public in the US, recent police
raids on spy shops have resulted in a haul of more than 4,000 devices. Much
like the pornography industry of old, more seems to be available under the
counter than over it. <BR>
<BR>
In the UK, the sometimes arcane legal system allows a shop to sell a bugging
device but it is illegal to use it to spy on people. The Spy Shop in London's
Bayswater, for example, sells pinhole cameras hidden in watches, binoculars,
cigarette packets and clocks, presumably for export. Students at Edinburgh
University have developed a television camera built into sunglasses. The
New York-based company CCS even sells a surveillance submarine. Bugs are
sold in products ranging from wall plugs to calculators to buttons and umbrellas.
<BR>
<BR>
Most can only transmit up to 250 metres but a bug attached to a telephone
line can transmit around the world. Fax interceptors which can reproduce
perfect copies of faxes sent or received on a chosen machine cost about
&#163;20,000 ($30,000). Scanners which can listen in to telephone conversations
on analogue (as opposed to digital) mobile phones are only about &#163;300.
It was a device of this sort which was used to record the Princess Diana's
infamous 'Squidgy' conversations with a male friend. It was overheard by
a private individual who listened to mobile telephone conversations as a
hobby. <BR>
<BR>
If worried, a company or individual may consider employing a counter-surveillance
consultant who can &quot;sweep&quot; buildings for bugs and produce a detailed
report listing all possible security risks. A typical sweep of up to 10
executive offices with telephones and fax machines costs roughly $5,000.
Devices have even been found in the foundations of a building but Kevin
Murray, director of counter-surveillance consultancy Murray Associates in
New Jersey, says that only 5% of sweeps detect bugs. Murray uses equipment
worth approximately $80,000 but a basic bug detection device can cost as
little as $450, a &THORN;gure which pales in comparison to the potential
cost of industrial espionage. Consultants can also train a company's staff
to conduct their own sweeps. <BR>
<BR>
All companies are potentially at risk, but certain industries are in greater
danger. This includes those in high technology or undertaking costly research,
covering businesses as diverse as vehicle manufacture, electronics, pharmaceuticals
and computing. Companies competing directly with a foreign firm are also
at greater risk. <BR>
<BR>
Recent cases highlight the problem. The Norweigan engineering group Kvaerner,
for example, launched a massive damages case against the Austrian firm VAI
Industries over the alleged theft of information from a UK subsidiary. According
to Kvaerner, a court-sanctioned raid by its officials uncovered more than
2,000 documents and computer discs belonging to subsidiary Davy International.
Among the VAI staff served with a writ was Roy Tazzyman, Davy International's
former chief executive. Both VAI AND Tazzyman deny any wrongdoing and by
late June, VAI was reported to be considering a counter-claim over the of&THORN;ce
raid. <BR>
<BR>
Authorisation of the raid was based on detective work by a commercial security
consultant, which had trawled through Tazzyman's dustbins. <BR>
<BR>
In an older but high-pro&THORN;le case, car-makers General Motors and Volkswagen
swopped suits over the alleged theft of company secrets. <BR>
<BR>
Events like these are a matter of the utmost seriousness for large firms.
For smaller companies they can prove fatal. Earlier this year employees
of Semiconductor Spares of Belmont, California were charged with industrial
espionage. After an anonymous tip-off, an FBI raid of their offices found
500 designs believed to have been stolen from Allied Materials. According
to the FBI, it also uncovered $200,000 in payments to an Allied Materials
employee. <BR>
<BR>
There are a number of signs to look out for. These include losing contracts
to competitors who give very similar but cheaper quotes, information leaks,
and break-ins where nothing appears to have been taken. Firms might also
ask questions when a competitor is able to match a new product suspiciously
fast. <BR>
<BR>
Spies have glamourous James Bond images, but the reality is that 007's industrial
counterpart is more likely to be found rifling through a competitor's rubbish
bins. This is legal in most countries, so it is wise to shred all confidential
material. <BR>
<BR>
Yet the most popular technique is still hiring someone from the opposition
team. &quot;People are the worst: they are not protective of their company's
information,&quot; comments Murray. Madson agrees: &quot;The threat is largely
internal.&quot; This risk increases if a company has a high staff turnover
as ex-employees usually go to work for a direct competitor. It is important
to check job applications carefully and use outside consultants sparingly.
However, leaks are often the result of disaffection, na&iuml;vet&eacute;
or carelessness. <BR>
<BR>
What staff members tap into their computers must also be safeguarded. Information
can be obtained by stealing a computer or copying onto discs. Access through
email and Internet servers is relatively easy for an experienced hacker
and there have been over one million reported security breaches on the Net
in the last four years. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Paranoia can be bad for business </B><BR>
<BR>
One suggestion for beating online theft is to include numbers in passwords
and use encryption devices. Users can also deploy a so-called firewall,
which places a barrier between a computer system and the outside world and
denies unauthorised access: Trusted Information Systems has put a free &THORN;rewall
kit onto the Internet. To limit further any risk, it is advisable to put
sensitive information onto discs which can be carried around at all times.
<BR>
<BR>
Information is becoming more accessible and its value is increasing. But
it is important to remember that over 90% of the most useful company information
is available legally. Too much paranoia and security can slow down efficiency
and create a sti&thorn;ing and counterproductive working atmosphere. <BR>
<BR>
Madson says it can be wise &quot;not to go high tech, but low tech&quot;
by putting confidential information on paper and limiting its circulation.
Perhaps a lesson can be learned from the tactics of US President Reagan's
team when he first met Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva. The
team was so worried about bugs that it communicated with children's magic
slates, which erase writing without a trace. So much for James Bond.<BR>

<H2>TIME OUT</H2>

<H4>Characters in Hollywood films are expected to earn their cash. Except
for women, who may marry for money </H4>
<H3>The reel way to riches <BR>
</H3>
<I>By Mark Tran </I>
<H3></H3>
&quot;You make as much money as you can. Whoever has the most when he dies
wins. It's the American way,&quot; says Danny De Vito in <I>Other People's
Money</I>, the 1991 film directed by Norman Jewison. De Vito plays Larry
the Liquidator, a corporate raider who takes over companies and breaks them
up for a quick buck. Modelled on '80s predators such as Carl Icahn and T
Boone Pickens, De Vito represents the profit motive in its unadulterated
form. He is more likeable than Michael Douglas's Gordon Gekko in <I>Wall
Street</I> but the two want the same thing. <BR>
<BR>
Getting rich is a bedrock of the American dream. Thousands of illegal immigrants
pour into the us in the quest for the good life, and Americans love rags-to-riches
stories. Hollywood also likes get-rich stories, the more sentimental the
better. What it does not like are rapacious capitalists. <BR>
<BR>
Although notorious for its own excesses - bloated salaries, ignored
budget and prima-donna behaviour - Hollywood likes to preach restraint
to others through its films. The other perennial Hollywood motif is that
money cannot buy love - unless you are Richard Gere in <I>Pretty Woman</I>.
<BR>
<BR>
In the recent political condemnation of Hollywood as a purveyor of sex and
violence to the masses, Republican presidential hopeful Robert Dole overlooked
one thing. When it comes to making money Hollywood takes an old-fashioned
attitude in its movies, which preach the same values of hard work and long-term
commitment that Dole prized when growing up in Russell, Kansas. Ironically,
that message seems quaint and even discordant given the dominant get-rich-quick
mentality. <BR>
<BR>
Although the casinos of Donald Trump and Native American tribes compete
for customers, us films take a dim view of gambling one's way to prosperity,
with Las Vegas typically treated as a place of broken dreams. In Albert
Brooks's 1985 comedy, <I>Lost in America</I>, Brooks and Julie Hagerty decide
to drop out. Unfortunately, they stop in Vegas for a last taste of luxury.
Hagerty proceeds to lose their entire nest-egg at the roulette table while
Brooks sleeps upstairs. In <I>Indecent Proposal</I>, an examination of the
power of money, the downward spiral for the main characters begins there.
And in <I>Leaving Las Vegas</I>, Nicolas Cage chooses this location to drink
himself to death. <BR>
<BR>
If anyone epitomises Hollywood's cinematic attitude towards money in the
real world it is Warren Buffett, the archetypal long-term investor who has
amassed one of the great fortunes of the 20th century. Buffett, who is now
the subject of several glowing biographies, carries plenty of material for
a biopic. A man from the Midwest grows fabulously rich through long-term
investments, not from busting up companies, and through it all, he retains
a James Stewart-like, everyman quality. The problem is that Buffett is dull
compared with a snake such as <I>Wall Street</I>'s Gordon Gekko. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The takeover as social murder </B><BR>
<BR>
In the mildly comic <I>Other People's Money</I> De Vito targets for takeover
New England Wire &amp; Cable, a struggling company owned by the worker-friendly
Gregory Peck. The shareholder meeting held to decide on the bid, the big
set-piece of the movie, presents two different views of capitalism which
mirror the real-life debate on a shareholder versus a stakeholding society.
<BR>
<BR>
In a crowded hall, Peck condemns De Vito for playing God with other people's
lives and compares him unfavourably with the notorious robber barons. &quot;The
robber barons of old,&quot; Peck thunders, &quot;at least left something
tangible in their wake - a coal mine, railroads, banks. He [De Vito]
creates nothing, he builds nothing, he runs nothing. In his wake lies nothing
but a blizzard of paper to cover the pain.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Peck goes on to condemn De Vito's takeover bid as &quot;murder on a mass
scale&quot;. He then tugs the heartstrings by describing a business as &quot;something
more the price of its shares, but as a place where people earn a living,
dream their dreams and the fabric that binds society together&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Recently, Labour Secretary Robert Reich made a remarkably similar declaration
in <I>Harper's </I>magazine. The corporation's ultimate goal was not pro&THORN;ts,
Reich said: &quot;The end is several other things... We want to have a society
in which most people have a chance at a high standard of living. We want
a society that has a moral character, in which there is a degree of trust
among people and a deepening sense of what it means to be a human being.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
De Vito has no time for such noble sentiments. He reminds shareholders that
they bought shares to make money. He argues that New England Wire &amp;
Cable is a dead company and urges the shareholders to take their money and
invest it elsewhere. &quot;Let's have the... decency to sign the death certificate,
collect the insurance and invest in something with a future,&quot; De Vito
tells the shareholders. &quot;Maybe you'll get lucky and it'll be used productivel,
and if it is, you'll create new jobs and provide a service to the economy
and even make a few bucks for yourselves.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
De Vito wins the proxy battle and the factory is closed. But Hollywood cannot
allow economic logic to prevail over a happy ending. A Japanese company
buys De Vito's stake and modernises the factory to make airbags. De Vito
makes a profit and the workers get their jobs back. <BR>
<BR>
There is no mixed message in Stone's 1987 film <I>Wall Street</I>, but then
Stone is an ideologue. Michael Douglas in the Gekko role is not merely rapacious
but a crook, using inside information to dismantle companies because it
makes him a player. Apart from his &quot;greed is good speech&quot;, Douglas
sneers at hard work. His philosophy is summed up in one line: &quot;It's
all about bucks, the rest is conversation.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Charlie Sheen, a small-time broker, ingratiates himself with Douglas by
providing inside information. Sheen persuades Douglas to buy Blue Star,
a struggling airline company where his father works. But the latter immediately
realises that his son is being used as a Trojan horse to break up the company.
Charlie Sheen saves the day by persuading a raider-turned-stakeholder to
buy Blue Star, causing Douglas to lose a pile of money in the process. Sheen
goes to prison for insider dealing but takes Douglas down with him. <BR>
<BR>
Adrian Lyne's 1993 film, <I>Indecent Proposal</I>, tackles head-on the question
of whether money can buy anything. Down on their luck, the loving couple
played by Harrelson and Moore take off for Vegas in the hope of a big score.
They lose but Robert Redford steps in, offering $1 million to sleep with
Moore. Redford wants to test the clich&eacute; that money can't buy love
by offering a lifetime of security for one night. <BR>
<BR>
The couple agrees to the Faustian pact but the relationship subsequently
crumbles. The film takes a neat twist when Redford falls in love with Moore,
before she ends up going back to her &THORN;rst love. For a moment, the
film tantalises us with the unromantic notion that money can indeed buy
anything, but the film soon reverts to sentimentality. <BR>
<BR>
While it clucks its tongue at get-rich-quick merchants, Hollywood takes
a different tack with women: it is ok for them to find wealth not through
sweat and toil but marriage. It is a persistent theme of Hollywood movies
stretching back to at least the '50s in films such as Billy Wilder's <I>Some
Like it Hot</I>, where Marilyn Monroe's goal is to marry a millionaire.
The motif crops up again in Howard Hawks's <I>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</I>
and Jean Negulesco's <I>How to Marry a Millionaire</I>. <BR>
<BR>
Despite the feminist movement and films such as Ridley Scott's <I>Thelma
and Louise</I>, the theme of poor girl who makes good by meeting rich boy
still has plenty of mileage. One example is <I>Arthur</I>, in which the
coarse Liza Minnelli marries the rich, loveable but dissolute Dudley Moore.
<I>Pretty Woman</I>, directed by Gary Marshall, is the most successful film
of that kind in recent years, proof that Hollywood believes in traditional
values when it comes to women as well as money. <BR>
<BR>
In <I>Pretty Woman</I>, Roberts plays an improbably beautiful and kind-hearted
hooker whom Richard Gere picks up while lost in Los Angeles. Gere plays
a corporate raider stalking a struggling shipping company so he can break
it up. In falling in love with Roberts, Gere becomes humanised and changes
his predatory spots and decides to invest in the company: it is as if De
Vito has metamorphosed into Peck. &quot;I no longer want to take over your
company and take it apart,&quot; says Gere to Ralph Bellamy, who plays his
erstwhile prey. &quot;I want to help you.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
It could be said that Gere does manage to buy happiness after paying Roberts
$3,000 to spend the week with him, but the focus of <I>Pretty Woman</I>
is more on Roberts. Her dream of finding her knight on a white horse -
or in this case in a white stretch-limousine - comes true. <BR>
<BR>
Hollywood's penchant for women who find happiness and wealth through men
also comes across clearly in <I>Working Girl</I>. In Mike Nichols's film,
Sigourney Weaver plays the corporate bitch from hell. She is a deal-maker
at a brokerage firm who employs an industrious secretary played by Melanie
Griffith. With her ridiculously big hair Griffith is definitely from the
wrong side of the tracks, but she wants to improve her lot in life. When
she comes up with an idea for a deal with an outside client, Weaver filches
the idea. But Griffith triumphs with the help of Harrison Ford, an outside
deal-maker who also happens to be Weaver's lover. She gets the deal and
the man: Weaver gets to look ridiculous. <BR>
<BR>
Through its films, Hollywood perpetuates the American dream of finding wealth,
success and happiness but prescribes a right way and wrong way of making
money. It should be earned the old-fashioned way, through honest toil or
patient investing. Trying to make a quick buck, as in robbing banks, is
not usually a good idea although some film crooks, as in the Thomas Crown
Affair, get away with it. But the Hollywood industry exempts women from
hard work. They can find the dream if they find the right man: preferably
one with money, lots of it.<BR>

<H2>BACKSEAT</H2>

<H4>Charles Darwent finds that the world can take offence at the drop of
a hat and offers a guide to survival for the unwary </H4>
Visitors to the Gulf emirate of Qatar may be suprised by one of the knick-knacks
that now habitually lie in wait for business travellers in their hotel bedrooms.
Skulking among the more usual undesirables to be found in quality hotels
- midget shoe buffers, anhydrous shower caps, unopenable sachets of
something called 'body shampoo' - will be a card with a puzzling message.
&quot;Remember!&quot; it says in accents of dread: &quot;Do not cross your
legs while in Qatar.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Weary after a transcontinental flight, the traveller may find himself sitting
up sharply on the end of his bed, musing over the message of the card and
why it should be so. A little known Koranic edict on deportment? The existence
of a species of Qatari predator which interprets the crossing of legs as
a sign of vulnerability? <BR>
<BR>
Well, no. The truth is that you must not cross your legs in Qatar because
in doing so you may risk showing someone the soles of your shoes. To do
so is to suggest that you consider him to be of a kind with that substance
in which you may inadvertently step should you cross a camel paddock without
paying sufficient attention to where you are going. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Crossed communication lines </B><BR>
<BR>
In Qatar it is, quite simply, the deadliest insult the emirate has to offer.
Cross your legs in neighbouring Bahrain with impunity. Fling them about
as you will in Dubai and no harm will befall you. Cross your legs in Qatar
and you may find yourself under threat of having them removed, not necessarily
with the aid of anaesthetic. <BR>
<BR>
Now this is the kind of thing to give the modern business traveller pause.
Picture the scene. There you are one minute, about to clinch that multibillion
dollar liquified petroleum gas deal. The next, white-robed arms are flailing
angrily, swords are glinting in the Arabian sun. Not only is the deal off,
but so may be various of the more favoured bits of your anatomy. <BR>
<BR>
It is one of the undeniably more inconvenient inconveniences of the jet
age. The fact that you board your 747 in a country where the natives speak
English and suffer from nasty colds and are decanted in one where they speak
Swahili and have occasional epidemiological tussles with paratyphoid need
not detain you unduly. A phrase book and a jab or two will see you through
most crises. <BR>
<BR>
But how is one to deal with finding oneself whisked, willy-nilly, from a
country where the crossing of the legs denotes nothing more venal than a
passing discomfort of the posterior to one where the same motion suggests
comparison with the end product of a camel's alimentary canal? <BR>
<BR>
And so - in the spirit of world harmony and international brotherhood
- we would like to offer readers a glimpse into the invaluable new
<I>Backseat Guide to World Body Language </I>(soon to be serialised in an
all-star video, <I>Mensch Without Tears</I>). Cheques for the complete <I>oeuvre
</I>should be forwarded in Swiss francs to the usual address. <BR>
<BR>
*Leg-crossing. This is an unexpected minefield. Quite apart from the example
quoted above, the etiquette of the lower anatomy marks one of the most divisive
of the innumerable transatlantic divides. All Europeans, of all sexes, cross
their legs in the same way, ie., with one knee tucked behind the other.
In America, only women cross their legs like this: American men rest their
ankles on top of their knees. <BR>
<BR>
Mr Tom Wolfe has suggested that this is intended to convey the impression
that the virile nature of the US male is such as to make knee-crossing impossible.
Whether or not this is so, Frenchmen or Hollanders who cross their legs
<I>&agrave; la mode europ&eacute;enne</I> in American business meetings
may find their commercial fortunes taking either an un- expected dip or
an inexplicable upturn, depending on the company they keep. <BR>
<BR>
*Pulling down the lower eyelid. In the Anglophone world, this gesture generally
indicates nothing more sinister than that the user is having problems with
his or her contact lenses. In Latin countries, by way of contrast, it implies
that the gesturer - and, indeed, many members of the gesturer's closer
male acquaintance - have been on intimate terms with the gesturee's
wife/sister/ grandmother/all three of the above. If this might be thought
to convey a cosy sense of familiarity, the implied message is actually rather
less well-intended. Anglo Saxon myopes doing business in Naples or Rio may
prefer to bring along a pair of spectacles for the occasion, just in case.
<BR>
<BR>
*Finger V-signs. Among the more perilous of the gestural <I>faux amies</I>.
In the English-speaking world, the forward-facing version of this gesture
is used to convey either (a) a sense of victory or (b) the fact that the
user would like two more large gins and tonics from behind the bar, please,
and light on the tonic. The backward-facing V-sign, contrariwise, suggests
something altogether less polite to do with the act of procreation. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Which way around? </B><BR>
<BR>
In most of the rest of the world, V-sign etiquette is (as might be expected)
precisely the reverse. Rounds of drinks are ordered <I>volte-face. </I><BR>
<BR>
The forward two-fingers, contrariwise, is intended to suggest that the wife
of the person at whom it is aimed is accustomed to entertain other male
friends while he is away. <BR>
<BR>
Thus when a battered Mrs Thatcher appeared on the steps of the British embassy
in Paris flashing forward Vs at waiting French journalists, she meant the
gesture to convey her determination to fight and win the leadership contest
that had been sneakily called back in London in her absence. <BR>
<BR>
In fact, the Iron Lady appeared to be telling the world that she considered
her opponents to be a fraternity of cuckolds: a frankness that won her astonished
admiration in certain factions of the French press, even if the muffled
cries of &quot;zut&quot; were actually misplaced.<BR>

<H3> THE INSIDER'S GUIDE TO MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS </H3> 
<H4> Distinguish yourself or die: Adrian Murdoch advises the advisers in an update of our regular
survey </H4> <P>

 Sitting at your executive desk, you look at the pile of invoices
awaiting approval. One stands out, the six-figure bill from a consultancy firm.
Its work resulted in a report which, by giving the stamp of outside authority,
helped get an unpopular pet project through the company board. But as you look at
the cost you cannot help asking: was it worth it?

<P> Sceptics of consultancy and its uses have become more vocal in recent years.
The view of Scott Adams, creator of the US business cartoon strip Dilbert,
typifies the worst type of fashionable opinion: "A consultant is a person who
takes your money and annoys your employees while tirelessly searching for the
best way to extend the contract."

<P> Yet at the same time, the management consulting industry is one of the
world's most envied of sectors. The global market for its services grew 18% last
year to around $40 billion and worldwide fee income from consultancy is expected
to hit around $21 billion by 1999, a compound growth rate of 13%.

<P> The demand is obvious and consultants are clearly offering some tangible
benefit. At the very least, they can bring cross-industry expertise to bear and
offer a fresh view for executives too close to the coalface. The analogy with
family therapy is useful, as much of a consultant's work involves talking to
people about problems. Poor communication is at the root of many organisational
problems: a failure to connect those on the shop floor with greater knowledge
about a particular issue with decision-makers on the board, for example.
Consultants can help bridge the gaps and identify problems.

<P> There are some <I>sotto voce</I> mutterings, however, which warn the industry
to beware hubris. Fees have only been growing, critics say, because of expansion
into underdeveloped markets such as east-central Europe and China. In these
markets, they add, such firms are getting money for old rope.

<P> Consultants have traditionally fitted into three broad groups: old-style
strategy firms like Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton or the Boston Consulting Group,
information technology specialists such as AT Kearney and Andersen Consulting and
multinationals like the so-called Big Six, which offer a wide range of services.
These distinctions are breaking down, however, with everyone now apparently
offering "change" as the philosopher's stone that will restore profits and
increase market share.

<P> There are three key areas that management consultants must address. Firstly,
there is an increasing perception that the sector bends too much with the wind
and cashes in on management fads. Even though business cycles are becoming
shorter, companies are starting to rail against firms that encouraged beleaguered
chief executives five or six years ago to downsize and are now arguing that they
should upsize.

<P> The other area for concern is that consultants have been slow to develop new
techniques and ideas. The Boston Consulting Group leaped ahead in the '70s with
exciting analytical tools, but in the '90s the industry has produced few new
thinkers. After all, a key selling point has been a supply of bright,
multi-talented individuals with a unique insight into industry. But in this
field, consultants appear to have stepped aside in favour of business school
professors. Where are the Moss Kanters, the Hamils and Prahalads of the
consulting world? Even CSC Index's James Champy plays second fiddle to former MIT
professor Michael Hammer as the advocate of reengineering.

<P> Third is the use of the Internet. Many consultants such as Andersen
Consulting, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Price Waterhouse pride themselves on IT
innovation and have developed successful and complex closed computer systems,
known as Intranets. They have been rather unsophisticated in their use of the new
medium, however, and the Boston Consulting Group does not even have a web site.
McKinsey stands out with a site both informative and clever.

<P> The lessons to be learned are threefold. First, clients' needs are becoming
ever more complex and the biggest demand is for consultants who can work across
borders. This is addressed by companies such as Price Waterhouse which have
developed an integrated global practice. Second, although the death of
traditional strategy firms is massively overstated, companies like Bain cannot
afford to ignore the implementation route if they wish to maintain growth. Third,
with fee income from traditional services such as audit on the decline,
accountancy firms are moving heavily into the consultancy market. Firms have to
differentiate themselves in an increasingly overcrowded market.

<P><I> <I>Additional research by Emily Spencer</I> </I> 

<H3> ANDERSEN CONSULTING
</H3> <P> Founded: 1989

<P> Number of consultants: 40,000, up from 32,711 in 1994

<P> Revenues: $4.2 billion in 1995, up 22% over previous year

<P> Of&THORN;ces: North America 63, Europe 47, Africa and Middle East 8, Asia
Paci&THORN;c 21, Latin America 10

<P> Head of&THORN;ce: Chicago, IL, US

<P> Web site: http://www.ac.com/

<P> Clients: Paci&THORN;c Bell, Deutsche Telekom, Samsung, AT&amp;T, Volkswagen,
Pirelli

<P> This management consultant heavyweight has been one of the success stories of
the '90s. Although not as glamorous as McKinsey or as friendly as Gemini,
Andersen is by far the biggest and most profitable consultancy and helps set the
standard for the industry. Wags refer to it as the McDonald's of the consulting
world because of the high number of projects it completes.

<P> The accounting practice Arthur Andersen was founded just before World War I.
By the '70s it had built up a huge systems consultancy and by the end of the '80s
its profitable consulting arm had split off.

<P> Between 1990 and last year, global fee income for Andersen Worldwide more
than doubled from $3.4 billion to $8.1 billion. Much of the expansion is down to
Andersen Consulting, which in 1995 grew 22% over the previous year. European
revenues increased 20% from $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion but growth has been
fastest in Asia Pacific, where revenues climbed 27%.

<P> The chairman of Andersen Worldwide, Larry Weinbach, has predicted revenues of
$9.3 billion this year and $16 billion by the end of the century.

<P> These demanding targets are feasible given the company's "value-based
arrangements" that link fees to profits or savings made by clients.

<P> Andersen has changed gradually from being a computer systems integrator to an
IT and management consultancy with an expanding outsourcing business.

<P> High-growth areas are the telecoms sector (57%) and industrial products
(53%). In the client/server sector, the company leads the market with a 9% share,
just ahead of IBM with 8%.

<P> Andersen's media profile has grown alongside its profits. A worldwide
television advertising campaign (the most recent shows a shoal of fish morphing
into one larger, more predatory fish) and sponsorship of the Williams-Renault
Formula One team have raised the company profile.

<P> The firm is famous for throwing the rank and file at problems (the typical
ratio is up to 16 juniors per partner). It does have an up-or-out culture but it
is not as strong as that found at McKinsey.

<P> Training is more crucial to Andersen's culture, with the company spending an
annual 5.5% of revenue and 6 million hours on the process. Recruits are sent to
boot camp at Andersen's 150-acre university, The Andersen Consulting Centre for
Professional Education in St Charles, Illinois, but even partners come back for
refresher courses. This fosters a particularly strong company culture and
consultants run the risk of being dubbed "androids" because their speech is often
littered with in-house jargon.

<P> Increasingly Andersen Consulting competes with Arthur Andersen's own
consultancy arm, and each year it transfers an uncomfirmed amount (estimated to
be $200 million) of its profits to Arthur Andersen partners under a 
profit-sharing deal.

<P> This situation has fuelled rumours that Andersen Consulting will split off
through a stock buy-back or a flotation towards the end of the year. Last year a
project team, Andersen 21, was set up to see how to take the company forward. Its
findings will be presented in the autumn.

<P> There are some cracks in Andersen's otherwise faultless fa&ccedil;ade. In
Britain the company had to pay an $18 million penalty fee for not delivering the
government's new National Insurance system in time and it has failed to win a
$1.5 billion, eight-year computerisation contract with the Post Office.

<H3>

</H3> <H3> ARTHUR D LITTLE </H3> <P> Founded: 1886

<P> Number of consultants: 3,000 plus

<P> Revenues: $514 million for 1995, up 20%

<P> Of&THORN;ces: North America 14, Europe 21, Asia Paci&THORN;c 8, Latin America
6, Middle East 3

<P> Head of&THORN;ce: Cambridge, MA, US

<P> Web site: http://www.adlittle.com/

<P> Clients: Nasa, Volvo, Ford, Mobil, Shell, Thomas Cook, Philips

<P> The leader in technology consultancy grew out of a research laboratory that
Arthur Dehon Little founded in the late 19th century. By the '50s the firm had
expanded into broad management consultancy. Its infamous advice that IBM should
not buy the Xerox patents is one of the company's few major errors of judgement.
It endured a period of confusion in the '80s when it over-diversified into
non-core areas. This culminated in 1988 in a threatened takeover by New
York-based Plenum Publishing. After that, US business was restructured and has
since proven successful.

<P> In the '90s the firm has been back on track, preaching a management
philosophy of incremental and modest innovation rather than radical concepts or
designs. Last year was ADL's fifth consecutive year of growth and chairman
Michael Younger is aiming for a 15% rise in revenue this year. The target is
feasible given that overseas revenue now represents 60% of the total and is
growing. The firm opened 12 new offices last year, 10 of them outside the US.
Already this year it has opened offices in Bombay and Seoul.

<P> Arthur D Little recently restructured its North American operation to align
with Europe and to focus on areas where it is pre-eminent. Restructuring was not
without pain as it had to lose 49 people (including 29 consultants) from its
financial and transport divisions.

<P> Now, operations are divided into functional practices focusing on strategy
and six industry sectors: automotive, chemical, health, metals, utilities and
information. The last covers media, electronics and telecoms because, the company
says, those industries were already converging. This strengthens the firm's
reputation as industry insider (consultants are more likely to be industry
experts than business-school graduates) and reinforces the internal help ethic
for which it is famous.

<P> The company is trying to gain a foothold in other areas. Last summer it moved
into organisational learning by acquiring the leading training consultancy
Innovation Associates &#173; a firm founded by Peter Senge, author of <I>The
Fifth Discipline</I> and director of organisational learning at MIT. This new
emphasis should help consultants better explain the roots of problems.

<P>


<H3> AT KEARNEY </H3> <P> Founded: 1926

<P> Number of consultants: 2,700

<P> Revenues: $650 million in 1995, up 19%

<P> Of&THORN;ces: North America 29, Europe 20, Asia Paci&THORN;c 11, Latin
America 3

<P> Head of&THORN;ce: Chicago, IL, US

<P> Web site: http://www.atkearney.com/

<P> Clients: Rolls-Royce, General Motors, former Treuhandanstalt

<P> McKinsey might call itself the Rolls-Royce of consultants, but Kearney has
the British auto-maker's account: a 10-year, $900 million joint contract to
outsource technology.

<P> AT Kearney has its roots in the company James McKinsey (see page 23) founded
in 1926. Andrew Thomas Kearney was McKinsey's first marketing partner but he left
in 1937 after McKinsey's death and a disagreement with Marvin Bower and set up
under his own name just after World War II.

<P> Last September, after a two-year courtship, EDS acquired Kearney for $600
million in cash and stock. Kearney needed the capital and IT capabilities and EDS
needed the expertise and the brand. The company became a wholly owned subsidiary
of EDS, but it retained the AT Kearney name and kept its board of directors,
management and Chicago headquarters.

<P> The buyer EDS was happy with the arrangement as Kearney has experienced
double-digit growth over the past 12 years. Under the leadership of long-time
chief executive and chairman Fred Steingraber it has been attracting bigger and
better clients in the US and, significantly, in Europe.

<P> On the surface the merger seems a marriage made in heaven. EDS's consulting
unit has doubled revenues and the number of consultants. It has given AT Kearney
an especially strong IT position to add to its traditional leading roles in
engineering and finance. The merger also helped expand the firm's reach into new
markets such as Argentina, Venezuela, New Zealand and the Philippines.

<P> The danger of the merger is that EDS's more strong-arm and bureaucratic
approach might stifle AT Kearney's popular common-touch consulting style. There
are also fears that EDS will use Kearney as a stalking horse to push its computer
services.

<P> Until now, AT Kearney's style has been very strong on client feedback and its
consultants have had no qualms about rolling up their sleeves and helping clients
implement changes. It is a successful technique: it is claimed that more than 80%
of the firm's jobs have positive results.

</H3> <H3> BAIN &amp; COMPANY </H3> <P> Founded: 1973

<P> Number of consultants: 1,200

<P> Revenues: $350 million-$375 million in 1995, up 25%

<P> Of&THORN;ces: North America 7, Europe 12, Asia Paci&THORN;c 7, Latin America
1, southern Africa 1

<P> Head of&THORN;ce: Boston, MA, US

<P> Web site: http://www.rec.bain.com/

<P> Clients: Guinness, Dun &amp; Bradstreet

<P> The most entrepreneurially minded of consultancies, Bain was formed in 1973
by former Boston Consulting Group vice-president William Bain and seven
former colleagues. By the mid-80s revenues had risen to more than $100 million.
With a list of blue-chip clients, the company charged astronomical fees. Dun
&amp; Bradstreet, for example, paid an estimated $35 million for a year's work.

<P> An ill-judged 30% stock buyback at the end of the '80s almost wiped out the
company and staff shrank from 1,300 to 1,000. Fighting between the old guard and
young Turks was vicious and after an unsuccessful attempt to sell the firm and
200 more job losses, Bain himself stepped down. He was replaced by the much
younger W Mitt Romney, head of Bain Capital.

<P> The company was rapidly restructured and since then has tried to project a
youthful image. The voice of the firm is Orit Gadiesh, the chairman of the board
noted for striking purple hair and a sharp intellect: she came top of her year at
Harvard Business School while finishing a psychology doctorate and learning
English (she is Israeli by birth). Gadiesh has done much to attract younger MBAs
and is popular because she leads by example: unlike many senior consultants, she
still spends most of her time with clients.

<P> Bain &amp; Co plays its cards very close to its chest: it refused to
cooperate with this report, for example. The company has developed ways of
keeping employees and achieving what it terms zero customer defections. One of
its strengths is in advising on acquisitions and divestitures. The company has
recently advocated the caring corporation: it has even trademarked the term
"loyalty-based management". This is quite a U-turn: Bain was one of the firms
most closely linked with the cold-hearted cost-cutting culture of corporate
America in the early '90s.

<H3> BOOZ ALLEN &amp; HAMILTON </H3>


<P> Founded: 1914

<P> Number of consultants: 5,200

<P> Revenues: $785 million in 1995, up 30%

<P> Of&THORN;ces: North America 42, Asia Paci&THORN;c 9, Europe 9, Middle East 1,
Latin America 6

<P> Head of&THORN;ce: McLean, VA, US

<P> Web site: http://www.bah.com/

<P> Clients: US government, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Nasa Space Station,
Procter &amp; Gamble, Boeing, L'Or&eacute;al

<P> Founded in 1914, Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton (BAH) has long had a reputation as
the one-stop management consultancy because it offered both IT and strategy
expertise. Like ADL it expanded too rapidly in the '80s, a time when it also
suffered from damaging infighting and internal bureaucracy. The '90s have been
much happier. The firm has reorganised along industry rather than regional lines,
primarily in two divisions: the worldwide commercial and worldwide technology
business units.

<P> The firm has a strong relationship with the US government going back more
than 50 years. Its work in the defence and intelligence sector has enabled it to
offer unique tools and it has adapted a computer war-simulation program for the
commercial world. Revenues from IT have doubled over two years and the company
hopes to maintain growth for at least three more.

<P> Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton has started to establish a presence outside the US
and has opened offices in a number of locations. Its current emphasis is on new
markets in the Asia Pacific region. It has been pushing heavily into Australia
where it won contracts with mining group BHP, National Australia Bank and others.
The firm has just opened its first office in India and plans up to four more
there in the near future. The firm will also attack new markets in China and
Korea.

<P> The company is popular because it spends a great deal of time working out
what has to be done and implements changes carefully. Clients like the fact that
it tries to offer a small-firm feel with large-firm capabilities. Critics say it
is too prescriptive, but it is moving away from that. However its presence in
Europe remains rather low key.

<H3>

</H3> <H3> BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP </H3>


<P> Founded: 1963

<P> Number of consultants: 1,320

<P> Revenues: $550 million in 1995, up 28%

<P> Of&THORN;ces: North America 9, Europe 16, Asia Paci&THORN;c 12, Latin America
2

<P> Head of&THORN;ce: Boston, MA, US

<P> Web site: n/a

<P> Clients: Russian government, Harvard Business School

<P> Set up by former ADL consultant Bruce Henderson, Boston Consulting Group
(BCG) was the first to specialise purely in strategy, a subject which began to
emerge as a discipline in its own right in the mid-60s.

<P> The company owed its initial success to innovative methods of analysis that
have since become business standards, identifying cash cows, experience curves
and portfolio management (aka the Boston Box). These were so successful that the
firm briefly stole the lead from McKinsey as the number one consultancy in the
'70s.

<P> The structure of BCG is based on 10 worldwide practice areas with specific
industry or functional expertise. Among the strategic issues these groups cover
are consumer goods and retailing, corporate development, energy and utilities,
financial services, healthcare, high-tech, industrial goods, IT and organisation
and operational management.

<P> The firm has a very clean-sheet approach to consulting: clients buy original
solutions. One downside, however, is that those solutions can be very
textbookish. Another is that the firm's stance against hierarchies can make
cross-border work unwieldy and difficult. Nevertheless the company does well in
keeping its customers: four-fifths of the 50 largest clients that engaged BCG's
services five years ago still retain them.

<P> Hiring procedures at BCG are rather MBA-oriented. The firm prides itself on a
rigorous selection procedure and exceptional compensation levels. BCG, which is
still privately owned, regards its consultants as top officer material while
rival consultants potter around in the engine room. In turn the company expects a
rapid career progression &#173; to senior partner in six to eight years rather
than 12 at, say, McKinsey. Consultants at BCG have such a high standing as
theoreticians that the firm has a revolving-door relationship with academia. It
hires business-school professors as consultants and sometimes loses consultants
to the same business schools.

<P> The &THORN;rm does not yet have the same ties with the brave new world of
computer technology, however: BCG is the only consultancy profiled here which
does not have a Net site.

<H3> COOPERS &amp; LYBRAND </H3> <P> Founded: 1898

<P> Number of consultants: 9,000

<P> Revenues: $6.2 billion in 1995, up 12.7% Consulting, $1.2 billion, up 34%

<P> Of&THORN;ces: More than 730 of&THORN;ces and member &THORN;rms in 126
countries

<P> Head of&THORN;ce: New York, NY, US

<P> Web site: http://www.colybrand.com/

<P> Clients: Levi Strauss, Digital

<P> One of the Big Six accountancy firms, Coopers &amp; Lybrand (C&amp;L) has a
long history in audit. Recently, it has become a quite a force in human resource
consulting and has achieved the largest growth of the consultants discussed here.

<P> The growth is a result of urgent fixes the company had to undertake. Until
1991, C&amp;L did not have a technology chief and it was lagging at the rear of
the Big Six in terms of fees. To address that, former chairman Eugene Freedman
replaced a third of the consulting staff, reduced 130 profit centres to 30 and
cut operating costs by almost a third in the US alone. These measures, along with
the introduction of a performance-related system, seem to have worked. The
consulting arm, which became a stand-alone operation early this decade, turned
its first profit in 1993.

<P> Technological innovations have also helped the company find its feet. Until
the beginning of the '90s, C&amp;L had no company-wide computer system: each
practice had <I>carte blanche</I> to buy what it wanted. The answer was the
Knowledge Network (similar to Andersen's Knowledge Xchange and Price Waterhouse's
KnowledgeView), an in-house information system that consultants can tap into from
anywhere in the world. Having tackled the problem itself, C&amp;L preaches that
IT should be a function rather than a prime resource within a firm.

<P> As has become the industry norm, C&amp;L links all fees to cost reductions
and about a quarter of its consultants have MBAs. One of the few criticisms of
the firm is that it is structured too regionally.

<P> Of special note is the company's work in east and central Europe. For the
sixth year in a row, the company has topped <I>Privatisation International</I>
magazine's league table of global privatisation advisers with 397 assignments
that have a disposal value of $21.5 billion. In Hungary, C&amp;L's turnover grew
20% last year as a result of its work in the energy sector. The firm is also
booming in the Asia Pacific region. Last year, fees in China grew by 300%.

<P> The firm is embroiled in a legal wrangle with Ernst &amp; Young (see page 20)
in Spain. Coopers &amp; Lybrand claims that E&amp;Y poached 90 of its consulting
staff in a four-day period, causing it to lose a major client, the Spanish
Airport Authority, as a result. The dispute has yet to be be resolved.

<H3> CSC INDEX </H3> <P> Founded: 1969

<P> Number of consultants: 450

<P> Revenues: $200 million in 1995, up 14%

<P> Of&THORN;ces: North America 6, Europe 4

<P> Head of&THORN;ce: Cambridge, MA, US

<P> Web site: http://www.csc.com/

<P> Clients: Hallmark Cards, Liberty Mutual, Lloyds Bank

<P> A leader in the change management field, CSC Index is the developer of
reengineering, the management buzzword that has done for the '90s what strategy
did for the '70s and quality for the '80s. The company is small but its work
carries considerable weight in the industry.

<P> In 1993, chairman and chief executive James Champy led the way with the
bestseller <I>Reengineering The Corporation</I>, which he wrote with former MIT
professor Michael Hammer. Last year he followed that with <I>Reengineering
Management</I>.

<P> The company was founded as a strategy specialist at the end of the '60s by
Tom Gerrity, who is now dean at Wharton Business School. The firm was bought by
IT experts Computer Sciences Corporation in 1988 and now acts as its strategy
management consultancy, working closely with its parent and systems integration
sister, CSC Consulting, to implement new processes. Its work in this &THORN;eld
for US bank Wells Fargo has been particularly noted. The company's position was
boosted in 1991 with the acquisition of London-based consultancy Butler Cox.

<P> The corporate backlash against reengineering has hit CSC's profits and it has
been looking at other potential growth areas. So far, the signs are that the
search will be successful. In May it signed an outsourcing deal with global
banking firm JP Morgan that was the most sophisticated and largest ever, worth
more than $2 billion.

<P> As a further protection against declining reengineering fees, CSC recently
merged with the Texas-based consulting and computer services firm Continuum to
boost its presence in the banking and insurance sectors. The company will now be
better placed to compete for outsourcing contracts and provide data management to
those sectors.

<P> The firm has also pioneered the inelegantly titled skill of
cyberpsychographics for companies that wish to market on the Internet.

<P>


<H3> DELOITTE &amp; TOUCHE </H3> <H3> CONSULTING GROUP </H3>


<P> Founded: 1845

<P> Number of consultants: more than 6,000

<P> Revenues: $2.6 billion in 1995, up 15.2%. Management consultancy revenue was
$1.4 billion, up 20%

<P> Of&THORN;ces: 124 consulting of&THORN;ces

<P> Head of&THORN;ce: Wilton, CT, US

<P> Web site: http://www.dttus.com/dtti/home.htm

<P> Clients: Microsoft, Chrysler, Daimler, Nike, Boeing, UK government

<P> The firm began in the 19th century when William Welch Deloitte opened an
accounting office in London. Early this year, its global consultancy practice was
renamed and reengineered to much short-term confusion.

<P> The UK consulting arm, then called Touche Ross Management Consultants, was
operationally linked with &#173; and took the name of &#173; the Deloitte &amp;
Touche Consulting Group in the US and Canada.

<P> Other consultancy arms throughout the world will follow within two years. The
new company will owe its partners' incomes and profits to a global rather than a
national company. The firm is adamant that unlike Andersen Consulting, it will
not seek to hive itself off from the rest of the accountancy practice.

<P> The change, a response to clients' requests for consultancy across borders,
will provide a single global identity and help the firm service large
multinationals and public-sector organisations. On a practical level, consultants
are grouped into multinational and multi-disciplinary teams. However the
management and control of projects will still be run on a regional basis.

<P> The firm believes that it gains a competitive advantage from the synergy
between consultancy and accounting, and is adamant that the former will not seek
to split itself from the latter. Its strengths are process reengineering, change
management and IT.

<P> This is because Deloitte &amp; Touche is the world's largest implementor of
integrated software systems via its wholly owned subsidiary International
Consulting Solutions.

<P> Russia has provided much recent growth. The consultancy opened an office in
Moscow with 10 employees in 1990: the firm now has six offices and 700 staff.

<P>


<H3> ERNST &amp; YOUNG </H3> <P> Founded: 1845

<P> Number of consultants: 9,419

<P> Revenues: $6.9 billion for 1995, up 14%. Consultancy arm $1.5 billion, up 9%

<P> Of&THORN;ces: 670 in 125 countries throughout the world

<P> Clients: British Aerospace, <BR> Coca-Cola, Reebok

<P> The audit king has been making great noises in the consulting market and is
one of the world's fastest growing professional services firms. Along with KPMG,
it is now rated number three in terms of global consultancy fees, snapping at the
heels of Andersen and McKinsey.

<P> Almost every aspect of E&amp;Y's consulting practice has been expanding.
Revenue in the US grew almost 50% and healthcare consulting alone grew 42.2%. It
has also been targeting the emerging markets with more offices in the Middle East
that any other professional services firm, four in China and plans to open seven
others there soon. To help expand into south-east Asia it formed an alliance with
Tata Consultancy Systems, India's largest systems development and IT company.

<P> To allow collaboration across geographical and organisational borders E&amp;Y
has been trying to create a virtual organisation via video-conferencing and
computer networks. The consultancy practice is split into two divisions:
Information Technology and Performance Improvement.

<P> Its corporate culture is fast and furious. Those who join from the outside
relish its integrated teamwork approach, in which consultants are attached to
individual practices. To encourage fieldwork E&amp;Y has taken on the idea of
hotelling, whereby consultants have no fixed offices and book space at a location
only when they need it.

<P> It seems that E&amp;Y can do almost nothing wrong. It is sometimes seen to be
lacking a distinct image but this has not affected the bottom line.

<P> The only error it seems to have made lately was both understandable and
human: in the US the management consulting division and the chairman's office
reported different revenue figures, which generated mentions in the international
diary columns.

<P>


<H3> GEMINI CONSULTING </H3> <P> Founded: 1991

<P> Number of consultants: 1,400

<P> Revenues: $548 million in 1995, down 1%

<P> Of&THORN;ces: North America 5, Europe 11, Asia Paci&THORN;c 1, Latin America
1, Africa 1

<P> Head of&THORN;ce: Morristown, NJ, US

<P> Web site: http://www.gemcon.com

<P> Clients: Union Carbide, Du Pont, Merrill Lynch, Glaxo, British Telecom

<P> The rising star of consultancy has waned somewhat recently. In the early '90s
it was spoken of in the same breath as McKinsey and Boston Consulting Group. The
reason for such fast initial growth was its range of expertise, the result of a
merger between the MAC Group (strategy experts), United Research (organisational
change experts) and Gamma International (leaders in information change).

<P> However, Gemini has shown little growth in the past two years: it has slipped
from the world's fifth largest consulting group to 15th position. Concerns over
revenues led Standard &amp; Poor's to downgrade the rating of Gemini's parent,
the Paris-based Cap Gemini Sogeti (CGS) group, from BBB to BBB minus.

<P> Last year Gemini downsized by firing one in 12 of its consulting staff and
carrying out a cull at the top when tensions between Gemini and CGS resulted in
the ignominious expulsion of the consultancy's founding chairman, David Teigler.
Chief executive Daniel Valentino followed him out the door a few months later
after disappointing results in North America.

<P> With morale at an all-time low, the company had difficulty attracting new
clients and industry watchers say that it has done little to differentiate itself
from competitors.

<P> Gemini's work style is based around the Four Rs, set out in <I>Transforming
the Organisation</I>, published last year by company co-chairman James Kelly and
senior vice-president Francis Gouillart.

<P> The Rs refer to reframing, or opening the corporate mind to new visions;
restructuring, a way of getting the company to perform competitively;
revitalisation, which aims at fostering growth; and renewal, the goal of
investing individuals with new skills. Because of the difficulties that Gemini
has been having recently, some people have asked whether the company should
perhaps listen to its own advice.

<P> To try to stop the rot, Gemini has focused on retaining good people. Instead
of "up or out", its stated philosophy is "grow or go". It is the first
consultancy to institute sabbatical programmes of up to three months to reward
high performers, attract top recruits and reduce burnout.

<H3> KPMG </H3> <P> Founded: 1867

<P> Number of consultants: 8,915

<P> Revenues: $7.5 billion in 1995, up 13%. $1.5 billion for consulting, up 28%

<P> Of&THORN;ces: About 95 specialist management consultancy of&THORN;ces
worldwide

<P> Head of&THORN;ce: New York, NY, US

<P> Web site: http://www.kpmg.com/

<P> Clients: European Commission, Lebanese government, British government, Hong
Kong government, Visa International

<P> Of the the Big Six firms involved in consultancy, KPMG is the most open and
international. It was the first to publish revenues, of which two-thirds now come
from outside the US.

<P> Founded in 1867 by Robert Fletcher in London, the firm has been involved in
management consultancy since 1955. In the past year, KPMG has identified six
business issues that it feels companies must address: post-merger acquisition
integration; globalisation and Europeanisation; financial turnaround; cost
reduction; business creation and privatisation.

<P> One of KPMG's strengths is IT. The firm has a strategic alliance with German
software company SAP, which provides fully integrated software, and is expanding
its capacity in that sector: it aims to employ 3,000 SAP consultants within the
next four years. This is a far cry from the bloodletting of 1990, when the firm
fired 300 partners.

<P> In the past 12 months, KPMG has developed two new schemes. It announced the
formation of a Global Year 2000 software conversion practice earlier in the year
to help corporations deal with the threat to their information systems from
computer date-change problems. And to reinforce the strong ethical culture for
which it is known, KPMG offered a free consultancy to any US organisation that
wants to diversify its workforce. It has established a Business Ethics Unit in
Montville, NJ, to change unethical behaviour in firms and measure ethical
practices in companies.

<P> The firm tries to recruit from different backgrounds: it is not uncommon to
&THORN;nd former doctors and biochemists rather than accountants and MBAs. It
eschews the up-or-out policy, recruiting carefully and working in a strong
appraisal culture. As a result, the attrition rate is in single figures.
Consultants are popular with clients for their unprescriptive style and their
emphasis on skills transfer. The firm's goal is for clients to understand the new
processes so well at the end of a project that they do not notice when the
consultants leave.

<P> There was substantial growth in India last year, the result of large projects
for the Central Bank of India and the Industrial Development Bank. The company
also worked with the British government in its electricity sector privatisation.

<P>


<H3> MCKINSEY &amp; COMPANY </H3> <P> Founded: 1926

<P> Number of consultants: 3,650

<P> Revenues: Estimated at $1.8 billion in 1995, up 20%

<P> Of&THORN;ces: North America 21, Europe 29, Asia Paci&THORN;c 12, Latin
America 4

<P> Head of&THORN;ce: New York, NY, US

<P> Web site: http://www.mckinsey.com/

<P> Clients: the Vatican, PepsiCo, IBM, Nissan, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Mexican
government

<P> McKinsey's consultants have been described as secular Jesuits. They are
gifted, arrogant, single-minded intellectuals who never doubt their credo. In the
profession, the firm's consultants are the knowledge merchants <I>non pareil</I>
and they relish being revered and feared. The news earlier in the year that the
Vatican has asked McKinsey for advice prompted many wry smiles. Results of a
worldwide survey by Swedish researchers Universum earlier this year showed that
McKinsey, dubbed "The Firm", was the employer of choice for graduates. But
however highly the company is rated by graduates, it is not nearly as high as the
firm rates itself.

<P> Founded by Chicago accounting professor James McKinsey in 1926, the firm
&#173; still run as if it were a partnership &#173; expanded rapidly under Marvin
Bower, who from 1939 controlled the company for almost 30 years. By 1950,
revenues had hit the $2 million mark. It soon became known as the first
consulting firm to hire directly from business schools.

<P> At about $1 million a report, McKinsey's advice does not come cheap. But
spurning the common practice of basing fees on results has not affected
McKinsey's bottom line. Its consultants are among the most profitable in the
business, bringing in an estimated annual revenue of $475,000. They also work
some of the most gruelling hours in what is a traditionally demanding business.

<P> For its mostly white, male employees, the company is fiercely competitive.
Each year, about 50,000 people apply for only 550 places. Inside, the company has
a rigid up-or-out policy that gets rid of about 17% of consultants a year. If you
don't make partner in five years you are asked to move on. Expressions of
personality are discouraged and there is a IBM-style dress code. All consultants
must wear long socks because Bower deemed it unseemly to show flesh in a business
meeting.

<P> Right up to the mid-60s all consultants, bar those in the San Francisco
office, had to wear hats. "The squeaky wheel at McKinsey usually gets discarded
not oiled," Tom Peters wrote rather bitterly of his experience with the company
after a fairly public spat.

<P> There is little scope for hand-holding after you call in the firm's
consultants. McKinsey's style is famously cerebral and hypothesis-driven. "So
what?" is the question teams ask as they discuss issues with a client.
Consultants do not work "for" clients, they work "with" them: they do not go out
on a "job", they have an "engagement".

<P> A recent growth area has been Asia: the firm opened a practice in Beijing
this year, only its second in China. The banking sector has also been expanding.
Since the '80s McKinsey has made a speciality of advising investment banks in the
wake of mergers.

<P> The company takes institutional knowledge development very seriously. It runs
a Rapid Response Network (RRN) with 70 volunteer consultant specialists that
promises a quick response to internal consultant and customer queries. Each
member of the RRN agrees to be on call for a couple of weeks a year (on top of
normal work) and guarantees that every question will be answered within 24 hours.

<P> This is not to say that the company never makes mistakes. It sat back for a
while and watched Boston Consulting Group clean up in the '70s before coming back
and its disastrous restructuring of General Motors in the '80s still haunts
partners.

<P> The list of McKinsey men in positions of power is long and the company
nurtures its alumni constantly and expertly. They range from the last three
director generals of the Confederation of British Industry; Lou Gerstner, the
chief executive of IBM; Michael Jordan, chief executive of Westinghouse; Kenichi
Ohmae and Tom Peters, management "gurus" <I>par excellence</I>.

<H3> MERCER MANAGEMENT </H3> <H3> CONSULTANCY GROUP </H3>

<P> Home of&THORN;ce: Boston, MA, US

<P> Web site: http://www.mercermc.com

<P> Clients: South African railways

<P> Mercer Management Consulting is one of the main strategy consultants and one
of the first consultancies to rail against corporate anorexia. It is certainly
anything but thin. Two of its consultants, Dwight Gertz and Joao Baptista,
trumpeted that very theme in a recent book, <I>Grow to be Great</I>. The firm has
expanded rapidly, doubling in size on three occasions since it was founded, and
last year it became the eighth highest revenue earner. The smart money expects it
to double again in three years.

<P> Founded as a result of a merger between Strategic Planning Associates and
Temple, Barker &amp; Sloane in 1992, Mercer is part of the Marsh &amp; McLennan
Group. At the moment, the focus is on Europe. In 1993 it acquired UBM, a German
consulting group. Two years later Mercer bought MID, the French strategy
consultancy that was merged into Mercer's Paris office. This year it opened its
first office in Hong Kong.

<P> Mercer believes that for a company to grow, it must have in place three
precepts: the value proposition, or making sure that customers judge the
company's product to be consistently better than that of competitors; economics
across the value chain, ensuring that product can be supplied at a low enough
cost to ensure profitability; and execution, or effectively delivering low-cost
products to the customer. The firm has been particularly successful in
telecommunications and post-merger company integrations.

<P> Mercer has a reputation for valuing its workers. It attracts people who care
about their colleagues and the value of a friendly office atmosphere, and it bids
strongly in the recruitment stakes.

<H3> PRICE WATERHOUSE </H3> <H3> MANAGEMENT CONSULTANCY </H3>


<P> Founded: 1849

<P> Number of consultants: 5,201

<P> Revenues: $4.5 billion in 1995, up 12%. Management consultancy income $1
billion, up 26%

<P> Of&THORN;ces: US, 100, 36 Europe. Altogether 434 of&THORN;ces in 119
countries.

<P> Head of&THORN;ce: New York, NY, US

<P> Web site: http://www.pw.com/

<P> Clients: Disney, Renault, Carlsberg, Croatian government

<P> Unlike its Big Six colleagues in this survey, Price Waterhouse (PW) is a
fully integrated global consulting organisation: partners share profit
internationally rather than regionally.

<P> Samuel Lowell Price founded the company in London in 1849. In 1865, William
Holyland and Edwin Waterhouse joined. Holyland retired six years later and the
firm became Price Waterhouse in November 1874. The company grew rapidly, and it
opened a New York office in 1890. Management consultancy services were formally
offered after 1963, but the company had been moving in that direction since the
mid-50s. By the '70s it had become one of the most profitable firms.

<P> At the beginning of this year the consultancy practice was restructured to
get rid of internal barriers and better serve multinationals. By combining the
US, Japanese and European services, the company can ensure the speedy delivery of
cross-border expertise. Scott Hartz was named managing partner in charge of
consulting services worldwide.

<P> Although Andersen hived off its consulting practice from accountacy six years
ago and Deloitte &amp; Touche did the same at the end of last year, PW is quick
to emphasise that it will not follow this trend.

<P> Price Waterhouse is particularly strong in the media sector &#173; it advises
Disney and film magnate Steven Spielberg &#173; and in east and central Europe.
The firm is number two in <I>Privatisation International</I> magazine's league
table of global privatisation advisers with 344 assignments that have a disposal
value of $11.62 billion. One particularly large assignment is Croatia's voucher
privatisation, worth $3.5 billion.

<P> Like many other firms, PW is showing particular growth in Asia (45%) but is
also targeting South America for expansion in outsourcing activities.

<P> One of the firm's core competences is in IT and about half of all new
recruits have IT backgrounds. The rest have line management experience in other
business disciplines from finance to human resources. Price Waterhouse was one of
the first consultancies to start using Lotus Notes, a software system that helps
share knowledge within a company, via an in-house, globally shared database
called KnowledgeView.

<P> In 1989, it became the first consultancy to sign an agreement with German
integrated software company SAP. At the end of last year PW formed an alliance
with Minneapolis-based Information Advantage, which will help speed the delivery
of IT solutions.

<P> Multi-disciplinary staff work in teams with management of blue-chip
companies. The company dislikes hierarchies: everyone in a team is considered an
expert and debate encouraged.

<P> The company's up-or-out policy &#173; in PW-speak ETL or "encouraged to
leave" &#173; has been relaxed recently. Increasingly, the company is creating
niches for people who do not want to move up to partnership level.

<H3> 2000 REASONS TO PANIC </H3> 

<H4> Computer systems
worldwide are heading for a crash in the year 2000 because of a digit crisis. But
the gulf between chief executives and their IT staff means that businesses still
have a huge task to prevent the biggest New Year hangover of them all, warns
Emily Spencer </H4> <P> 

It is January 1, 2000 and something has gone badly wrong.
Awakening with a hangover, you go to the bank where a queue of people is buzzing,
thwarted by cash machines that do not work: the bank's safe will not open because
its time code has gone haywire. Back at home, news &thorn;ashes interrupt the
usual upbeat New Year programmes with tales about the breakdown of a nuclear
power station and a series of aeroplane crashes.

<P> One of the &THORN;rst letters of the new century to arrive on your doormat is
a bill that adds 100 years' interest to your credit-card charges. Back at work a
few days later, colleagues cry as computers crash and &THORN;les disappear.
Clients steam with rage when they receive grossly in&thorn;ated invoices. To top
the mood of crisis, Washington announces on the evening news that its weapons
systems have failed.

<P> This is an alarmist picture of what may happen at the turn of the century,
but the dangers are serious enough. A pervasive programming fault in the way
computers keep track of the years could cause millions of computers worldwide to
fail, affecting everything from air-traffic control to major business
transactions. The scale and cost of the problem is huge and rising every month.
Companies must act now as time is running out.

<P> The problem arises because most commercial application programs more than a
few years old use just two digits, not four, to calculate the year: for example,
they record 1996 as 96. When 2000 arrives the computer will "read" 00 as 1900.
Computers will calculate that the age of someone born in 1958 is "minus 58 years"
and pensioners could appear on waiting lists for primary school.

<P> Computer consultant and Year 2000 expert Peter de Jager, from Brampton in
Ontario, told a conference of UK civil servants this year: "If architects built
buildings the way programmers designed systems the &THORN;rst woodpecker would
destroy western civilisation. Our woodpecker has arrived in the form of 00, the
Year 2000."

<P> Experts say large companies will need three to four years to tackle this
millennium time bomb. Changing codes and programs is only half of the battle:
companies need an additional year to test and debug them. As companies use their
computers all week long, much of the work will have to be done on weekends, which
makes prompt action all the more essential. There are only about 500 working days
and 120 weekends left until the end of 1998.

<P> The root of the problem is historical. Many computer programs were &THORN;rst
written in the '60s and '70s at a time when computer storage space was scarce and
very costly. Programmers thought that application programs would be replaced
before the millennium. Instead, they were modi&THORN;ed over the years.

<P> Jim Inglis, a computer scientist at Birkbeck College who sat on an
international committee standardising computer codes, says that at the time no
one would use more storage than absolutely necessary because of the cost: "This
continued through sheer convention when there was no more need to save space."

<P> Now organisations around the world are reaping the chaos of delayed reform.
Even worse than a crash is the prospect of different systems making simple
miscalculations, causing problems that take weeks or months to discover. This
includes aircraft computers shutting down because they calculate they have not
had any maintenance for 99 years. Nuclear power stations could suffer the same
fate and the Pentagon has warned that the US might not be able to protect itself
if this happens to its nuclear weapons systems.

<P> The problem is compounded by the fact that even a cleaned-up IT system could
be corrupted again if it shares or receives information from an infected external
computer. Furthermore, it is not just IT systems that are affected. Every device
that uses a software timer could be at risk, including a bank safe. Jacky
Olivier, director of the Year 2000 project for Hoskyns, says that many devices
containing computer chips, such as faxes, could be affected.

<P> Although the Year 2000 issue has been widely publicised, many companies are
either unaware of the scale of the problem or are ignoring it. De Jager told the
US House of Representatives Science Committee this year that less than a third of
US companies has started to change its programs. Hoskyns, the UK division of Cap
Gemini Sogeti, surveyed 121 British &THORN;nancial institutions and found that
40% are still in the process of "assessing the scale of the problem" and only 4%
had started to change their applications.

<P> A number of bodies, including the UK government's Central Communications and
Telecommunications Agency (CCTA), produced a report showing that only 8% of
British companies across all sectors had conducted a full audit of the problem
and only 15% of senior managers knew of its existence. Their conclusion: "Unless
speci&THORN;c action is taken immediately, what is currently a manageable problem
will become a crisis in 1997 and 1998."

<P> According to Robin Guenier, a former chief executive of the CCTA who is
organising a Year 2000 conference for chief executives, "Those who say it is not
a problem have often not started to tackle the issue whereas those who have are
much more worried".

<P> Already, companies are experiencing difficulties. Marks &amp; Spencer, the
British food and clothing retailer, became aware of the problem last year when
its computers rejected tins of corned beef that had use-by dates beyond 2000,
calculating that they must be almost 100 years old. British driving licences have
been refused by some US car-hire computers because they run out in the next
century.

<P> Credit cards cannot be issued with expiry dates after 1999 because machines
will calculate that they are long out of date. And any program that uses two-date
digits to calculate sums needs to be &THORN;xed, including accounting
applications and programs involving &THORN;nancial transactions. The Gartner
Group, an IT research organisation, estimates that 90% of such programs will be
affected in 1999.

<P> Technically, the problem must be addressed from three angles. A computer
system generally has three layers: its hardware, an operating system offered by
vendors such as IBM and application programs that large companies usually develop
themselves. Companies with IBM-compatible operating systems can buy a program to
update them for the Year 2000 and other vendors should release similar products.
But companies that have bought operating systems from vendors that have since
gone bust may &THORN;nd their systems extremely difficult to &THORN;x, and it is
almost impossible to salvage corrupted hardware. Philip Oliver, IBM's European
Year 2000 executive, says that companies with this problem may have to buy new
PCs.

<P> Large companies may have up to 30,000 application programs with thousands of
lines that need to be checked: some businesses have more than 10 million lines of
code. These companies will almost certainly need outside consultants,
particularly if they have cut staff in internal IT departments.

<P> The re-programming task is not complicated but is likely to take a long time.
Using the manual approach, each program will take about three days to change. To
&THORN;x 20,000 programs will take 60,000 days or more than 300 man years.
Hoskyns' Olivier says this is a very repetitive and labour-intensive task. Inglis
concurs: "It is not an intellectually demanding job. It is very, very tedious.
Programmers are going to miss things." For this reason, the equally
time-consuming job of testing is vital.

<P> There are expensive tools coming onto the market that will cut the time
needed for this process in half, according to consultants, but they warn that
companies waiting for a "magic bullet" tool that can identify the wrong date and
change programs by itself are misguided. "Anyone who is waiting for that is
kidding himself," says Hoskyns' Olivier.

<P> Jerry Smith, chief technical officer for the Massachusetts-based computer
consultancy &THORN;rm Semaphore, insists that none of his clients has a digit
problem because the company uses object-oriented programming. This allows
programmers to identify and change separate "objects" such as time more quickly.

<P> Time is not the only problem: companies will also have to pay out more money
the longer they wait to act. The Gartner Group estimates that fees have increased
from 30 cents a line of computer code three years ago to more than $1 per line
today and large companies can expect to pay from $50 million to $100 million.
Even small and medium-sized companies will be hit hard, because they will have to
increase spending drastically within a short time period without raising
pro&THORN;ts.

<P> Costs will rise every few months because of the scarcity of programmers who
know Cobol, the most common old-fashioned computer language. Many of the original
programmers are long-retired and companies are already poaching staff from each
other to get the best workers. In one example quoted by De Jager, a large US
insurance company was on the way to solving its digit problem when three of its
top people moved to another company. The estimated cost of starting again from
scratch was $13 million. "Every company in every country faces the same
deadline," says Olivier. "There won't be enough programmers available."

<P> Governments will &THORN;nd it particularly hard to keep their IT staff as
large companies tempt them with huge rises. There is a similar anecdote about an
IT expert working for the US government who was offered $1 million to work for a
consultancy. He refused, reportedly because he thinks he can hold out for more.

<P> Estimates of what it will cost businesses worldwide to &THORN;x the Year 2000
bug range from $400 billion (IBM) to $600 billion (the Gartner Group). The big US
computing services company EDS estimates the cost of solving the problem in
Europe alone at $600 billion. It has been suggested that it may cost the US
government $25 billion and the British government &#163;5 billion ($7.5 billion)
to &THORN;x their systems.

<P> Consultants say that one reason why the Year 2000 problem persists is that IT
managers take a short-term view, because they change jobs frequently. Others are
ashamed to tell the boss because of the large cost involved or because they wrote
the programs themselves. "A lot of people are saying 'I will have retired by
then' or are putting their heads in the sand," explains Hoskyns' Olivier.

<P> Those who work in IT are also renowned for failing to meet deadlines:
Microsoft's on-line magazine is named <I>Slate</I>, apparently, because when
programmers ask each other how a new project is going, the usual reply is,
"S'late". But this is one deadline that cannot be put off.

<P> Managers have tended to leave IT alone and focus on higher level strategy.
With computers now essential to modern business, however, this attitude is no
longer tenable. Oliver of IBM says: "The Year 2000 issue is not just about
technology. It is at the heart of the competitiveness issue." The answer,
according to Guenier, is to see the issue as a management rather than technical
one: "Those with senior positions in IT are not there because they are good
managers but because they are good at IT."

<P> Even when CEOs are aware of the problem, they can be reluctant to tackle it
because of the huge expense involved. "There is a lack of board-level commitment
but because of the price tag, a project like this needs heavyweight people behind
it," says Hoskyns' Olivier. "The business bene&THORN;t is simply to stay in
business, which is a very bitter pill to swallow."

<P> The US is way ahead of most countries in &THORN;ghting the Year 2000 bug. A
recent EDS survey of 352 European companies revealed that only 45% have made
plans to defuse the date time bomb. German companies have made the most progress,
Italians have made the least. Some governments are acting to ensure that their
companies prepare for the millennium. Singapore has passed laws obliging
companies to change their programs and the US government is considering making
inaction illegal.

<P> If a company has not tackled the problem, it should &THORN;rst identify which
programs and code lines are affected. Oliver says IBM started to look at the
issue in the late '80s. "We thought we would replace systems faster than we have,
which is a common problem for companies." With its expertise, IBM is in a much
better position than most companies and expects to be ready by the end of 1997.

<P> Core systems should be a priority. Chris Town, in charge of the Year 2000
issue at Barclays Bank, says: "We are focusing &THORN;rst on the
business-critical systems important to us and our customers. These should be
ready by 1998."

<P> Consultants and software developers suggest that companies use the whole
problem as an opportunity to clean their systems thoroughly. According to Tani
Haqui, chief executive of Virginia-based software company SQL, the Year 2000 is
"the tip of the iceberg in terms of software problems". Haqui's company has come
up with a program to help managers and programmers track the steps a new program
goes through in its development stage. This makes it easy to go back and
&THORN;nd mistakes, reducing the risk of bugs.

<P> If after all this you are still sceptical or believe that the Year 2000 is an
issue dreamed up by consultants and programmers to allow them to dig deep into
your pockets, you might be tempted to test it out on your computer. You would do
better to resist. One businessman changed the date on his computer, setting it to
just before midnight on December 31 1999. Unfortunately, he had a program that
time-stamped data and deleted any &THORN;les more than &THORN;ve years old. The
next thing he knew, most of his &THORN;les were gone.

<H3> THE MYTH OF PARTITION </H3>

<H4> As ethnic rivalries multiply, outsiders
often see partition as an easy way to limit their involvement and end the
bloodshed. But history shows that it can often makes things worse. Lessons from
the Cold War and Britain's divide-and-quit past suggest the need for new
solutions, writes Radha Kumar </H4> 

<P> There is a law of partition that runs
something like this: when countries face ethnic division, the warring parties
reach for a copy of the Swiss constitution. This seems to make sense: after all,
the cantonal system has given a multinational state with few natural resources
several centuries of peace and prosperity.

<P> The above law has operated on a number of occasions. During desperate
last-minute negotiations to stave off war in Bosnia-Hercegovina in 1992, it is
said that the Serb, Croat and Muslim delegations all arrived in Lisbon bearing
copies of the Swiss text. Warring parties in Cyprus, Sri Lanka and Kashmir have
also used the document as a common point of reference.

<P> But what works for the Swiss is likely to be of little use in other contexts.
It was an independent candidate from a Tamil-dominated region in Sri Lanka who
pointed out the absurdity of a 1956 proposal to apply the Swiss model: "Let the
[Tamil] federals produce a map of Switzerland. Does it make as ridiculous a map
as the one of Ceylon produced by them? Does not even common sense suggest to them
that there should be geographical continuity among the cantons of the various
states?"

<P> Despite the unhappy experience of modern partitions, there is a deep-seated
belief among many governing elites that the process of slicing countries into
pieces provides a short-cut to ethnic or religious peace. If people cannot live
together, they should live apart.

<P> Last year's Dayton agreement on Bosnia reignited an old debate on partition
as a solution to ethno-nationalist con&thorn;ict in the post-Cold War era.
Although the policy has recurred as an administrative means of resolving
political con&thorn;ict since the third century, when Diocletian divided the
Roman empire along an east-west axis, it began to acquire its capital P only from
the turn of the 17th century and matured only in the 20th.

<P> Since then it has been deployed in two contexts: as a part of the British
divide-and-quit policy in Ireland, India, Palestine and Cyprus, and as part of a
Cold War policy of ideological divide and rule, as seen in Germany, China, Korea
and Vietnam. Now that the Cold War has ended, con&thorn;icts seen as ethnic have
taken centre-stage in contemporary security concerns. These are categorised as
prolonged low-level con&thorn;icts over statehood between groups that de&THORN;ne
ethnicity according to language, culture, race or religion.

<P> Attention has turned to partition as a means of resolving or containing such
wars, following the division of Ireland, India, Palestine and Cyprus which were
said to be based on irreconcilable ethnic differences. The argument goes that
partition is probably the most humane form of intervention in an ethnic
con&thorn;ict because it attempts through negotiation what would otherwise be
achieved through war: it telescopes the con&thorn;ict and saves lives.

<P> Yet the success of divide-and-quit depends on who is getting (or staying) out
and where the partition is. The quitting impulse goes some way to explaining
British support for partition in Ireland and India. From the sequence of events
in Bosnia, it seems clear that Europe and the international community were
prepared to accept partition if this would curtail outside intervention in the
con&thorn;ict and limit the length of western involvement.

<P> But does it work? Proximity has made it very difficult for the British to
disengage from Ireland; if anything, partition has involved it more closely in
the six counties of the north. Bosnia's Europeanness creates a similar difficulty
for both Europe and the US. It is already clear that international troops will
have to remain longer than Washington planned. The international civilian
presence has multiplied severalfold since the Dayton peace accord and its tenure
is likely to extend beyond the &THORN;ve years originally envisaged.

<P> For the inhabitants of a partitioned country, the policy means misery. They
pay an incalculable price through continuing loss of life, a consequent drain on
resources, the barriers imposed on economic development by con&thorn;ict and the
psychologically debilitating sense of victimisation.

<P> Partition is sold as a means of ending con&thorn;ict. It can, however, be
argued that the reverse is true: that far from curtailing war, partition is an
essential element in it (see below, pages 28-33).

<P> It is often argued that partition can be achieved through a peaceful rather
than a bloody population transfer, especially where it is agreed in advance.
India is seen as a prime example in this context, because the Congress Party and
Muslim League had agreed to partition before civil war broke out. But it is
difficult to imagine millions of people agreeing to give up their homes without a
protest.

<P> The Greek-Turkish population exchange, agreed as part of a settlement
following World War I, is frequently cited as a peaceful transfer because it did
not take place in conditions of war, but it nevertheless comprised the forcible
movement of populations. The British examined population transfers in
considerable detail during early discussions of the partition of Palestine in
1936-7. The recognition that these would have to be achieved by force was one
argument for jettisoning partition plans.

<P> In Bosnia, as in India and Palestine, populations were transferred by force
rather than agreement. This process began in the spring of 1992, when Serb
paramilitaries and the Yugoslav National Army (JNA) began to create the eastern
crescent and western bloc of the ethno-territory later named Republica Srpska. At
the same time Serb forces began shelling Bosnia's capital city, Sarajevo. By the
summer, a three-way partition of Bosnia had been &thorn;eshed out by Serbs and
Croats and detailed maps of Republika Srpska and the Croatian entity Herceg-Bosna
were agreed, including the partition of Mostar. Until this point Croats and
Muslims had shared the brunt of Serb attack, but now the Croatian paramilitary
HVO turned on the Muslims in the east of Mostar.

<P> The HVO began to consolidate its hold on territory with cash and materiel
support from its backers in Croatia, including President Franjo Tudjman's
government. In October con&thorn;ict began between the Croats and the Bosnian
army. Within the &THORN;rst six months of the war the thrust towards partition
was unmistakable: borders had been agreed by the main contenders and various
armies had launched offensives to impose them on the ground. European leaders
appeared to anticipate this development. At the European Community-sponsored
peace conference in September 1991 the chairman, former British Foreign Secretary
Lord Carrington, sought to avert a war of partition by proposing power-sharing
arrangements that were both decentralised and ethno-political.

<P> This was an approach last adopted by the British in India in the years before
partition. It had failed partly because it was grounded on ethno-nationalism,
elements of which had informed British colonial policy for many years. In a
policy commonly referred to as divide-and-rule, the British initially granted the
right to hold local elections in tandem with the creation of separate Muslim and
Hindu electorates. Instead of encouraging power-sharing, the policy stimulated
con&thorn;ict between the minority Muslim League and the majority Congress Party,
encouraging ethno-political mobilisation in both communities.

<P> Its effects were bitterly felt between 1945-7, when the British attempted to
negotiate an agreement on power-sharing between Congress and the League that
would allow a British withdrawal from India and avert a war of partition.
Negotiations broke down time and time again over two related issues: Congress's
refusal to concede the League's claim to be sole spokesman for Indian Muslims
&#173; which would by implication give Congress a clearly Hindu label &#173; and
the League's defensive refusal to enter any power-sharing relationship that would
question its right to rule in Muslim-majority areas.

<P> By breaking down trust, ethno-politics militates against power-sharing.
Congress and the League came to the verge of agreement on a decentralised
federation of Muslim and Hindu-majority provinces in 1946, but the agreement
broke down when the League refused to allow the Congress to nominate a Muslim to
the transitional government.

<P> More strikingly, the British-brokered 1960 constitution that made Cyprus
independent was an attempt to avert the partition the British had themselves
threatened in 1956. It was based on a minimum compromise that employed the
principle of ethnic representation at every level. This created separate
municipalities and provided for ethnic quotas in the civil service, the police
and the army.

<P> Though Turks comprised some 18% of the population, they were allocated 30% of
the jobs. They were also given a right of veto in legislative decisions on the
electoral system and taxation. Because the constitution was achieved by engaging
moderates on either side while conciliating ethno-nationalists, it stimulated
protracted con&thorn;ict that eventually resulted in the Turkish invasion and
partition.

<P> As the case of Palestine shows, ethno-political negotiation generally leads
to ethno-territorial consolidation: the more demographically mixed the regions
the more violent the process. In Bosnia, once it was clear that the international
community would mediate on an ethno-political principle, the logical move was for
the warring parties to consolidate territories.

<P> Thus, in 1993, when UN mediator Cyrus Vance and his EU colleague David Owen
proposed 10 ethnically based cantons under a weak federal government, it helped
escalate the Croatian-Muslim con&thorn;ict to all-out war. According to Owen, the
cantonal borders had been arranged so that no single ethnic group would have
contiguous territories, thus preserving the unity of Bosnia. But the Croatians,
who stood to gain larger territories under the plan than they either controlled
or could claim on the basis of ethnic proportionality, hastened to expel Bosnian
Muslims from these areas. The Serbs, who stood to lose territory, at &THORN;rst
attempted to establish contiguous territories and then rejected the plan.

<P> By 1993 Washington had moved closer to support for the ethnic partition of
Bosnia. In May the US, Russia, Britain, France and Spain put forward a Joint
Action Plan for a union of three republics, the sealing-off of Bosnian borders
and the establishment of six safe areas. The plan was widely seen as a harbinger
of the next stage of talks towards a three-way partition. Hard bargaining began
over territorial boundaries which continued well into the autumn, accompanied by
&THORN;erce &THORN;ghting. The US, however, was pursuing a two-track policy:
while officially supporting the Joint Action Plan, it made behind-the-scenes
attempts to limit partition by brokering a Muslim-Croat federation. Initially
these attempts were met by intensi&THORN;cation of the Croat-Muslim war but US
pressure eventually persuaded Tudjman to sign a federal agreement with the
Muslims in March 1994. Viewed as a tacit acceptance of the two-way partition of
Bosnia, it was immediately followed by a Serb demand for recognition of Republika
Srpska and renewed attacks on Muslim eastern enclaves.

<P> The Washington agreement, a version of the Swiss cantonisation model, in fact
brought partition to a more intimate stage. Like the 1960 Cyprus constitution, it
mandated ethnic representation at local as well as national levels and extended
it to the civil services, entrenched partition from the bottom up.

<P> Under the Washington agreement, Mostar was intended to embody precisely the
opposite process: the city was placed under international administration so as to
dissolve partition at the local level. But because the agreement on Mostar made
all decisions dependent on a council composed equally of Croats and Muslims, each
represented by their own mayors, the EU administration found itself a frequent
and rather expensive bystander as the ethnic nationalists who partitioned the
city consolidated power through the agreement's provisions. The struggle still
continues despite recent city elections.

<P> Not that Richard Holbrooke, then US assistant secretary of state and the
architect of the Dayton agreement, would admit that partition was on the agenda.
Refusing to use the label, he told a US news programme that the voluntary
dissolution of Czechoslovakia &#173; the bloodless "velvet divorce" of 1992
&#173; was a better comparison. The disingenuity of this comment was striking,
given that the Dayton agreement was prefaced by another Serb onslaught on the
eastern enclaves of Bosnia that resulted in the fall of Srebrenica and the worst
genocide of an already atrocious war, while the international community stood by.
The west continued to dither while the Serbs moved on to Zepa and only threatened
air strikes when Gorazde, the largest enclave, was imperilled.

<P> Meanwhile, Croatia conquered the Serbian-held Krajina, resulting in a mass
exodus of indigenous Serbs to Bosnia. President Clinton responded by saying this
meant a solution for Bosnia might be in sight. At the same time, Serb forces
mopped up in the Muslim eastern enclaves. It was now possible to see a viable
partition on the ground.

<P> This suspicion grew as Croatian and Bosnian forces jointly attacked
Serbian-held areas, which fell with the same ease as the Krajina. Only when the
Croatian-Bosnian forces controlled the 51% share of Bosnian territory that was
allotted them in 1993 by the international community did international pressure
to halt the war become overwhelming.

<P> In other words, the Bosnian war only underlines the point made by the
partitions of Ireland, India, Palestine and Cyprus: in demographically dispersed
countries partition is only achieved through the violent creation of ethnically
homogenous territories on the ground. Indeed, partition negotiations can occur
either as the culmination of war, or as its cause.

<P> It is now being argued, in the context of the Dayton Accord, that to agree
partition after homogenous territories have already been established is
substantively different from consenting before their creation on the ground.
Quite apart from the peculiar formalism of an argument that ignores the process
of tacit and not-so-tacit recognition of partition, it is usually fallacious to
argue that ethnically homogenous territories have already been created. Close to
half the population of Bosnia remain refugees outside Bosnia: ethnically
homogenous territories can only be created if they are refused repatriation to
the towns and villages from which they were driven. In this sense "peaceful
partition" is a grotesque misnomer for a process that can entail genocide.

<P> Signi&THORN;cantly, partition is often seen as a temporary solution to a
crisis, which can be reversed later. Experience shows, however, that
ethno-nationalist partitions have never been reversed: instead, the process has
inexorably driven communities further apart. Sinn Fein's acquiescence to the
partition of Ireland, for example, was conditional on a later referendum on
uni&THORN;cation. The referendum never took place and now, when there are renewed
negotiations on the status of Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein has to face the ironic
possibility that Ireland may no longer wish for uni&THORN;cation.

<P> India similarly hoped that a subsequent vote would reverse the partition.
Again, no vote took place. Instead, Pakistan was further divided when Bangladesh
split off in an even uglier war than that sparked by India's division. As most
Bosnia-watchers would agree, yet another partition lurks within the Dayton
Accord: the disintegration of the Muslim-Croatian Federation.

<P> Nor does partition ensure a post-war peace. Far from solving the Irish
con&thorn;ict, partition merely helped to entrench guerrilla con&thorn;ict in
Ulster: India and Pakistan have twice gone to war and continue to battle over
Kashmir. The Middle East has suffered from conflict since the partition of
Palestine and recent moves towards peace resulted in the assassination of Israeli
prime minister Rabin.

<P> Indeed, partition can often hamper the development of post-war peace.
Attempts to build economic cooperation and encourage cross-cultural exchanges in
south Asia have been successively impeded by the Indian-Pakistani dispute over
the status of Kashmir.

<P> Irish nationalists and UN mediators in Palestine both hoped that moves
towards economic union would gradually dissipate the horrible aftermath of
partition. Instead, partition's legacy was to thwart economic union and keep both
regions in poverty. The lessons of these examples for Bosnia are noteworthy. The
Dayton Accord provided for economic union in the hope that market forces would
bring the Serb entity and the Muslim-Croat Federation closer together. Experience
elsewhere implies this hope is unfounded.

<H3>Ireland 1921  </H3>  

<P> Although
the British idea to divide Ireland cropped up late in the midst of talks on home
rule during the 1919-21 Irish war for independence, partition had been suggested
years before, when Irish Protestants threatened to secede if Catholic Ireland won
home rule. In&thorn;uential support for this position on the British mainland led
London to explore means of excluding Ulster from Irish home rule, including a
temporary <BR> six-year partition. By 1914 Irish Nationalists and Ulster
Unionists had agreed on the principle, but were deadlocked on the division of
territory. But the willingness of moderate nationalists to consider partition
divided and splintered the movement through the creation of the radical
nationalist Sinn Fein.

<P> Although home rule was suspended during World War I, negotiations continued
and gained new impetus from the Easter 1916 nationalist uprising. The execution
of the rebellion's leaders by the British infused Irish nationalism and in 1918
Sinn Fein swept the polls, declared independence and formed an Irish Assembly.
Partly under the pressure of these events, Britain tabled the Government of
Ireland Bill in 1919 giving Ireland two parliaments, one for the south and
another for the north.

<P> The original proposal was aimed at averting partition along religious lines
by including all nine of the Ulster counties in the northern parliament. This
would have ensured roughly equal proportions of Protestants and Catholics.
However the Unionists' desire to have <BR> a separate parliament and their fear
of living with too large a Catholic population moved talks towards a six-county
limit.

<P> Sinn Fein, arguing that the bill was tantamount to a double partition of
Ireland and Ulster based on religion, rejected it and con&thorn;ict spread across
the country, escalating to guerrilla war with the formation of the Irish
Republican Army in 1920. Nor did the war end in 1921, when Britain negotiated a
treaty with Sinn Fein offering South Ireland dominion status on condition that it
<BR> accept the creation of a separate Ulster that would remain within the United
Kingdom.

<P> By this time, Sinn Fein preferred that Ulster remain under British rule
rather than have its own parliament because this would keep open the possibility
of uni&THORN;cation. The treaty provided for a temporary partition <BR> of
Ireland on condition that a referendum on reuni&THORN;cation be held within two
years. The decision to accept partition split Sinn Fein, adding two years of
internecine con&thorn;ict to communal con&thorn;ict. The British later reneged on
the promised referendum.


<H3>India 1947</H3>

<P> Like Ireland, the religious partition of north-western and eastern India that
created two independent states, India and Pakistan, emerged from a
now-you-see-it-now-you-don't process of devolution from London's imperial
control.

<P> In 1917 British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour of Palestine fame promised a
"gradual" move towards self-government in India but over the next 20 years it was
introduced at local levels only.

<P> As in Ireland, war hastened partition and independence. Following World War
II the radical new Labour government had no desire to pit an emaciated Britain
<BR> against powerful Indian independence movements and it agreed to the speedy
transfer of power.

<P> Although partition was decided only in 1947, the idea had been proposed
intermittently from the early years of the century.

<P> By the '40s British officials, especially those in north-western India, were
referring openly to an entity called Pakistan. The decision to divide India was
taken in 1946 after the breakdown of negotiations on a decentralised
federation.

<P> Agreement was &THORN;nally given to the ethno-nationalist logic of the
"two-nation theory", that separate nations deserved separate territories. This
entailed the division of Punjab and Bengal and meant not only a much smaller
Pakistan than that envisaged by its advocate, the Muslim League, but also a
Pakistan divided into east and west, and separated by India.

<P> The partition of India was announced quickly after the agreement was
&THORN;nalised, before borders had been decided and without any consideration of
the people involved.

<P> In the six months following the decision to establish the partition, close to
4 million people died and 20 million were displaced as a partition planned on
paper was then bloodily created on the ground.

 <H3>Palestine 1948 </H3> 

<P> Detailed proposals for the partition of Palestine had been made by the
British in 1937-8, spurred by Hitler's persecution of the Jews. However the
eastward spread of World War II and the Axis threat to British positions in the
Middle East led to a rapid reversal of support for a Jewish state.

<P> After the war London proposed a &THORN;ve-year trusteeship that would include
a large amount of <BR> self-government for Arab and Jewish areas. The proposal
was rejected by Arabs on the grounds that this would entrench partition and by
Zionists on the grounds that it would create a single state with an Arab
majority.

<P> In 1947 the British referred the dispute to the UN. This produced a minority
proposal for a binational federal state and a majority proposal for partition.

<P> The Security Council opted for partition, with a special UN regime for
Jerusalem and a continuing economic union for Palestine.

<P> Britain then washed its hands and announced that it would withdraw in May
1948. Con&thorn;ict broke out in Palestine and rapidly escalated into war between
Israel and a clutch of Arab states, resulting in the displacement of some 750,000
Palestinian Arabs, whom Israel refused to repatriate once the war had ended.

<H3> &#009;Czechoslovakia 1993 </H3> <P> Czechoslovakia is often cited by
supporters of partition. The country divided in peace on January 1, 1993, just
four years after the anti-communist revolution. The result, separate Slovak and
Czech Republics, re&thorn;ected their different histories and political cultures.

<P> The creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 out of the former Austro-Hungarian
empire was the result of horse-trading between the &THORN;rst President TG
Masaryk and various Czech and Slovak emigrant groups in the US. A referendum on
union with the Czechs was promised to the Slovaks but was never made good. So
from the outset, there was the bitterness of a broken promise at the heart of the
marriage between the two Slav peoples. That may have been partly responsible for
the strong showing of anti-Czechoslovak parties in Slovakia before World War II
and the subsequent creation of a Nazi puppet state run by clerico-fascist Slovak
collaborators.

<P> The installation of a communist regime from 1948-89 froze the <I>status quo
ante</I> but within a year of the restitution of democracy, strains developed
between the liberal ex-dissidents around Federal President Vaclav Havel in the
Czech capital Prague and the regional government in Bratislava, which was keen to
articulate a Slovak identity and move more slowly on economic transformation.

<P> Unable to agree a workable plan for devolution, the two sides were caught in
years of increasingly frustrating negotiations up to the 1992 federal elections.
These returned the nationalist Vladimir Meciar to power in Slovakia and the
impatient economic reformer Vaclav Klaus in the Czech Republic.

<P> With Havel's liberal dissidents gone, the Czechs resumed negotiations in a
brisk <BR> no-nonsense atmosphere and called Meciar's bluff. Havel's long-stated
demand for a referendum was brushed aside by the regional Czech and Slovak
governments which quickly agreed on separation. Since then relations have
remained civilised and indeed there was never any suggestion that the division
would be marred by violence: for one thing, Havel made it clear he would never
use force in Slovakia.

<P> Although it is tempting to point to such a happy experience as a model, there
are several reasons why this is inappropriate. The main one is that it is largely
unrepeatable. Czechoslovakia was always likely to be an easy divorce: there was
very little ethnic mixing and no tradition of inter-communal violence. At worst
there is irritation rather than hatred between the two peoples.

<P> It is also too early to tell whether partition is bene&THORN;cial. Although
the Czech and Slovak economies have prospered since the split, the federation
would almost certainly have achieved a similar performance. And from a
geopolitical point of view the division has left Slovakia somewhat adrift, more
prone to look east than west for neighbourly support. The unrivalled control of
the populist and illiberal Meciar has arguably ensured his country's exclusion
from Nato and the EU.

<P> The divorce also left the Czechs alone with themselves, an even smaller
country in a region full of small countries, leaving a grain of self-doubt.

<P> The evening the split was agreed, one Czech negotiator wondered aloud about
the decision: "Before tonight I hadn't really thought about the implications, we
just got on with the talks. Now I ask myself, just what have we done?"

<H3> Bosnia 1991 to present </H3> 
<P> The case of Bosnia shows that
partition provides no answer to ethno-nationalist con&thorn;icts.  In March
1991, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic met Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
to discuss a partition of Bosnia. The Croatians wanted a division into ethnic
cantons or restructured as a union of three constituent nations but Bosnian
President Alija Izetbegovic rejected the proposal.

<P> By autumn 1991 the &THORN;rst outlines of partition began to be sketched. In
September Bosnian Serbs started declaring so-called Serb autonomous regions and
in November the Croats followed suit, declaring a "Croatian Community of
Herceg-Bosna" in the 38 mainly Croat communes. Later that year Serbs and Croats
agreed on borders. In February 1992, a week before the referendum on independence
for Bosnia-Hercegovina set by the European Community as a condition of
recognition, the Community sponsored talks in Lisbon that focused on the
possibility of cantonisation.

<P> Few believed that it would take more than three years of bitter war,
prolonged international mediation and an intervention force of 60,000 heavily
armed troops to make partition acceptable. Few realised that the subsequent peace
settlement would largely formalise what war had already achieved.

<P> Yet this, it seems, is what will happen. Formally, the Dayton peace agreement
of last November is intended to institute a prolonged cease&THORN;re that will
result  in a peace based either on partition or reintegration. Most
Bosnia-watchers agree, however, that the chances of reintegration are slim since
it depends on the erasure of internal borders, the reinforcement of external
borders, the prosecution of war criminals, the return of refugees and a speedy
injection of massive &THORN;nancial aid.

<P> Instead, with a little help from Nato, the zone of separation is turning into
a <I>de facto</I> partition line that might soon constitute the real border
between Serbia and Bosnia. The border between Croatia and Bosnia continues to lie
deep inside western Bosnia, while refugees are caught in a game of population
transfer: as late as March, Serbs were resettling Brcko, an area under
international arbitration. Even the promised aid, which at $1.5 billion fell far
short of the $5 billion estimate for basic reconstruction, has not arrived.

<P> The two main &THORN;gures indicted for war crimes, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko
Mladic, continue to wield considerable in&thorn;uence in Serb-controlled
territories. Elections planned for September are not expected to be free and fair
and will probably constitute another stage of the partition process. Their virtue
will be to demonstrate that "the people" want ethnic states, precisely why the
Serbs fought in the &THORN;rst place.

<H3> NASTY OR NICE? </H3> 

<H4> The intellectual tide
is now beginning to turn against downsizing. The focus has shifted from the
benefits of mass redundancy to the impact on social peace and business
ef&THORN;ciency it seems to entail. But the nicer alternatives, if they are to
succeed, call for that elusive quality of management originality. Francis Harris
reports from the shop&thorn;oor </H4> <P> Downsizing is not just a dirty word at
the Lincoln Electric Corporation plant in Cleveland, Ohio. It is redundant. The
idea was given its marching orders in 1948 and it has not been heard of since in
the cavernous factory halls of the welding equipment manufacturer.

<P> The people at Lincoln are not exactly smug about this feat. Every business,
however successful, ought to know that resting on your laurels is a sure way of
provoking disaster. But there is some incomprehension about what has happened in
the rest of the US, where many companies have improved the bottom line by sacking
staff.

<P> There are now some indications that the intellectual tide has turned against
downsizing as the cure-all for corporate ailments. Of course, firms have always
laid off staff and they always will: once again this summer, there has been a
grim roll-call of casualties from America's corporate frontline as Nabisco,
Digital and other giants laid off staff.

<P> But there has been a backlash. In the '90s, senior managers are described by
the media in terms close to those used for the generals of World War I, men
lambasted for lack of imagination and over-reliance on a single strategy. In both
the US and Britain, the two countries where the blood-letting has been most
severe, there is now widespread political and public hostility to downsizing and
its practitioners.

<P> There is also a gathering alliance of economists, management theorists and
consultants who question whether the cure is more damaging than the illness and
who stress the need for growth in revenue. In this atmosphere, companies like
Lincoln that have bucked the trend are being put under the microscope to see what
lessons, if any, can be learned by other firms.

<P> Richard Sabo has some claim to personifying the spirit of the firm. A 30-year
veteran, he held a number of positions including some on the shopfloor before
becoming assistant to the chief executive. Asked about downsizing, he is careful
never to say never: "I'm sure that it is inevitable in some circumstances, but we
like to think that we would try everything else first."

<P> In the recessions of the '80s and '90s that commitment was put to the test at
the firm, which has a US payroll of 3,500. On both occasions Lincoln held the
line through its use of flexible employment practices. Factory workers turned
salesmen and were sent out into the country to boost revenues, while other
workers were re-employed on maintenance work.

<P> The firm argues that this sort of scheme proves its value when there is an
upturn in the wider economy. While rivals have to rehire and retrain, Lincoln can
rapidly put staff back into productive work. While the firm lost money in 1992
and 1993, last year it posted record profits of $61 million on sales of $1.03
billion. In the first quarter of this year, net sales were up nearly 6% to $278
million.

<P> This story might have been different if Lincoln relied on Wall Street, but
the firm's shareholders are descendants of the founder or former employees. Thus
when Lincoln's management wanted to pay staff bonuses in the loss-making year of
1992-3, it went and borrowed the cash. "The shareholders were very
understanding," Sabo says.

<P> The firm has an unusual pay and benefit system. After three years staff are
guaranteed at least 30 hours' work a week but pay is calculated according to
performance, as are holiday entitlements. They are also expected to put defective
products right in their own time, so there is a considerable incentive to produce
the best product as quickly as possible. According to Sabo, Lincoln's US
pieceworkers make $62,000 a year compared to the national average of $55,000: the
best make up to $130,000.

<P> The incentives mask a tough attitude. Management trusts staff and expects
hard work in return. There are no unions: Sabo says the employees have no desire
for one. Overtime is non-negotiable, so that at busy times staff can work up to
70 hours a week. "We are pretty tough," Sabo says. "We expect people to be
dedicated and accept overtime. Anything less would be a disservice to everyone."

<P> Not everyone likes this and the firm is coy about the number of employees who
leave before the three-year watershed. "We find many people looking for a job,
but not so many who want to succeed," Sabo says. Even so, the company rarely
needs to be heavy-handed: "Our employees are committed to a job. They never cease
to amaze me. Even if they are not asked, they come back [late] at night to check
on a job. It's a culture that we expect people to pass from one generation to the
next."

<P> Such a comment probably summarises the Lincoln attitude, with its stress on
continuity. While management elsewhere is often accused of slavishly pursuing the
latest management craze, its system has developed from the ideas of founder James
Lincoln who established the firm 101 years ago. An advisory board established in
1914 gives workers the chance to discuss issues with the chief executive or
chairman and there are regular meetings in the canteen which draw up to 400
staff.

<P> Despite the evident commitment to consultation, there are worries among the
staff. Recent years have seen a growing number of outsiders brought into the
company and some question whether new board members and finance staff have the
same commitment to the Lincoln way as those raised within the company. One worker
said he had heard an accountant muttering that the firm had mortgaged its future
by paying out such high bonuses.

<P> Even so, it seems unlikely to abandon its independent course. Chief executive
Donald Hastings parades his company's example, telling one recent business
meeting: "We need to find creative solutions to replace the notion that lay-offs
are a cure-all for a company's problems. It is management's responsibility to
find solutions, to plan ahead for down times, to be flexible enough to respond to
any new situation. That's what management is all about."

<P> For many industrial workers who have been downsized out of a job, and for
politicians seeking an alternative model, Lincoln Electric might sound close to
paradise. Indeed, many other companies have sent teams to examine the Lincoln way
and it was represented on President Bill Clinton's corporate citizenship panel
that sought "good corporate citizens" to hold up as examples. But like so many
firms with alternative strategies, it is a success in its own terms: the fact
that many workers leave in less than three years raises doubts about how it might
work if applied more widely. The truth seems to be that Lincoln has blazed its
own trail and it would be hard for others to follow.

<P> It is a point made by downsizing debunkers like Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of
organisational behaviour at Stanford Business School. "This is an issue of
mind-set: there is no magic bullet. The very fact that most managers cannot do it
means that those who are able to do it can achieve enormous returns. How can you
get above-average returns if you do what everyone else does? The only way to
achieve that goal is to do something different."

<P> This holds true for other successful US rogue corporations cited by Pfeffer
such as Southwest Airlines, Wal-Mart, Tyson Foods, Circuit City and Plenum
Publishing, which rank as the top five performing firms in the country from
1972-92 in terms of returns to shareholders. He identifies the defining element
in their success as an imaginative approach to managing the workforce, but doubts
that this can be applied in some mechanistic fashion by competitors. And of
course, even if they could, a law of diminishing returns would come into play.
"If everyone looked like Demi Moore, she would not be worth the same amount of
money and it is the same with companies. If every company could grow quickly, it
would be valued less," Pfeffer says.

<P> Although he argues that downsizing is a failure, like most of the debunkers
Pfeffer does not rule it out: "The simple lesson is to understand where your
value is coming from. If [downsizing] actually creates value, then perhaps it's
the wise thing to do. But I think the evidence is fairly clear that the only
thing guaranteed by downsizing is that you get smaller."

<P> A number of US firms have been given favourable press. Johnson &amp;
Johnson's ethical approach and its patience with non-performing subsidiaries and
managers is wholly at odds with current Wall Street thinking, yet it produced a
17% return to investors from 1989-94.

<P> Hewlett-Packard has won plaudits for showing a sense of corporate
responsibility and for helping redundant workers find new jobs, while smaller
firms such as vehicle parts maker Fel-Pro of Illinois has been feted by the White
House for its distribution of generous employee benefits. The privately owned
jeans maker Levi Strauss received considerable publicity when it promised
employees a year's extra pay if cashflow targets are reached in 2002. In the UK,
considerate employers such as the giant Cadbury-Schweppes and the smaller
domestic heating group Baxi Partnership have attracted positive comment.

<P> The search for alternatives is the result of an implicit alliance between
management theorists, economists, business figures and politicians that has
reached critical mass over the past year. But this shift has failed to produce a
coherent theory with the same appeal as downsizing. Firms that cut staff can
expect the markets in New York and London to reward them with a rapid improvement
in share price, although many observers question whether the reward is lasting.
The problem is that while "nice" behaviour can pay dividends, it is a far tougher
course and requires greater imagination than being "nasty".

<P> Two years ago Gary Hamel and CK Prahalad wrote <I>Competing for the
Future</I>, in which they described alternative strategies for productivity
improvements and growth. The authors argued that the starting point was an
independent point of view about future opportunities. Firms seeking an improved
return on investment could follow two paths. Either they could increase net
income (the numerator) or cut assets and payrolls (the denominator). Faced with
the need to make quick returns, many managers took the easy path and cut staff.

<P> "The United States and Britain have produced an entire generation of
denominator managers. They can downsize, declutter, delayer and divest better
than any managers in the world. Even before the current wave of downsizing US and
British companies had, on average, the highest asset productivity ratios of any
companies in the world," they wrote.

<P> But without growth, reducing staff or assets is simply a means of selling
market share at a profit. Taking the example of Britain during the Thatcher years
of the '80s, Hamel and Prahalad point out that from 1969-91 manufacturing output
rose by just 10%. Encouraged by a welter of deregulation and anti-union
legislation, manufacturing employment fell by 37% while British ministers
trumpeted the resulting surge in manufacturing productivity. "In fact," the
authors note, "with scarcely any net gain in real manufacturing output over the
period, British companies were in effect surrendering global market share."

<P> Two events this year have propelled a shift in the debate. The first was the
noisy presidential election bid by right-winger Pat Buchanan, who campaigned on
an uncompromising ticket expressing middle-class fears about job insecurity .
This swelled an already considerable volume of journalism on the subject. Mused
<I>The Washington Monthly:</I> "What do we do if there is not enough...
decent-paying work to go around in a democracy built on the work ethic? Would the
democracy survive if there were millions and millions of unemployed or
under-employed men and women pushed out of... white-collar and skilled
blue-collar work?"

<P> The US daily <I>The New York Times </I>&#173; one of those rare institutions
taken almost as seriously as it takes itself &#173; decided the issue was so
important that it merited the longest piece of reportage the paper had produced
since the Pentagon Papers. The resulting book, <I>The Downsizing of America,</I>
made the startling claim that 43 million US jobs had been lost since 1979.

<P> "Workers have always lost jobs in America to the churning cycles of the
economy and [usually] more jobs were being created than eliminated, but never
before had lay-offs persisted with such tenacity and in such magnitude in an
expanding economy," it wrote.

<P> To the defenders of downsizing who suggested the economy was doing well, the
paper responded: "Almost 200 years ago, the same argument might have been made
when the peasants of England were shunted off the land and left to toil in misery
in the slums. It was good for the economy, maybe, but it also precipitated the
wrenching social ills that fill the sorrowful pages of Charles Dickens."

<P> The second factor to change the debate was the conversion of one of the high
priests of downsizing. The public recantation by Morgan Stanley chief economist
Stephen Roach clearly surprised a lot of people. In a report earlier this year,
Roach mused: "In the face of intense competition, managers may simply have pared
the largest [cost], worker compensation, which represents 70% of corporate
production expenses. If that is so, the so-called productivity resurgence has
been built on slash-and-burn restructuring strategies that have put extraordinary
pressures on the workforce. This approach is not a permanent solution. Tactics of
open-ended downsizing and real wage compression are ultimately recipes for
industrial extinction."

<P> Every action produces a reaction and the defenders of corporate change have
been quick to respond. For every American Management Association survey showing
that downsizing is bad for business, there is a response from financial
institutions showing that corporate profits have merely returned to '60s peaks.

<P> According to a research paper by Joshua Feinman and John Williams of Bankers
Trust, the share of US national income taken by employees has remained at about
72% since the '70s. Since 1959, the share taken as corporate profits has
fluctuated around 10%. The common belief that workers have lost out to
shareholders is bogus, they argue: once rises in non-wage compensation like
bonuses and retirement benefits are included, workers are being rewarded for
higher output.

<P> While they accept that living standards have fallen for many Americans they
say: "The average worker is not being cheated by unscrupulous corporations or
cheap Third World labour. Workers as a group are getting their just rewards. And
these rewards have continued to grow, albeit at a pretty sluggish pace in the
past generation."

<P> Jill Jacobs of Goldman Sachs makes a similar argument in a research paper
produced in June, where she says that the rise in profit margins merely reflects
a return to the "normal" profit levels of the '60s. But now that profits have
returned to these levels, they are likely to stabilise as a share of GDP.

<P> Nonetheless, Jacobs accepts that this "return to normal" has been achieved at
a price: "White-collar workers saw their displacement rate &#173; the rate of job
loss for workers tenured three years or more &#173; rise from 2.6% in the early
'80s to 3.6% a decade later. Although white-collar workers have a high
re-employment rate, the churn in jobs is important because it creates uncertainty
by indicating that even managerial, executive and administrative jobs are not
immune from downsizing pressures... displaced workers typically rejoined the
labour force with lower earnings &#173; a 7.7% average decline for white-collar
workers and a 10.9% average drop for manufacturing workers."

<P> Among those entering the fray is Paul Krugman, the Stanford economics
professor. In an article in <I>Slate</I>, Microsoft's online magazine, Krugman
takes issue with those debunkers in the US administration led by labour secretary
Robert Reich, whose arguments are described as "clear, compelling, brilliantly
packaged and mostly wrong".

<P> Krugman cites a report by the White House's own council of economic advisers
to counter the argument that downsizing is cutting through the sinews of the
American middle class. "The big picture looks like this," Krugman says. "Both the
number of 'good jobs' and the pay that goes with [them] are steadily rising...
Only a relative handful of good job holders (which is to say only a few hundred
thousand a year) experience serious reverses. America's middle class may be
anxious, but objectively it is doing fine." The real losers are those on the
bottom, "who do not have good jobs and never did. Those with lousy jobs have seen
their already low wages sink."

<P> The council's report found the US economy to be in good health. From 1993-6,
8.5 million new jobs were created and two-thirds of these paid above-average
wages. Most of these jobs were full-time. Nonetheless, the author Joseph Stiglitz
said that real wages had stagnated and income inequality widened: "Data from
1981-93 indicate that job-losers were more likely to be permanently dismissed
(rather than temporarily laid off), that older workers were subject to a greater
risk of job displacement and that the average real wage loss due to displacement
was significant and persistent."

<P> In an apparent reference to Reich's concerns, Stiglitz acknowledged the
"considerable evidence" that Americans are anxious about job loss, but like
Krugman appealed for an objective examination of the evidence.

<P> This reaches to the heart of the debate. While an examination of cold
statistics may be grist to the optimists' mill, that message is simply not
getting through to the population at large. It is tempting to attack the
messenger. Thus Krugman refers to downsizing as a "camera-ready tragedy, perfect
for media exploitation" and John Cassidy in <I>The New Yorker </I>talks of a
journalistic growth industry. In other words, the population is being misled by
journalists who cannot see the woods of economic success for the trees of
individual suffering.

<P> But the problem is the message, not the messenger. For all the weaknesses of
<I>The New York Times</I> articles, so clinically exposed by Cassidy (the
estimate of 43 million lost jobs is suspect and ignores massive US success in the
creation of jobs), there is an underlying core of truth to what journalists are
reporting. The "good news" heralded by cold statistics are unlikely to achieve
much resonance with the middle-class man made fearful as friends lose jobs and
angry at ever-longer hours of work.

<P> This may be attributable to the first real experience of economic insecurity
among the middle classes since the Great Depression, but it clearly exists.
<I>The New York Times</I> reproduced a survey of graduates from Bucknell
University's class of 1970. Some of the findings among graduates are startling:
72% feel it is unlikely that young people will have a better life than their
parents; 54% are working longer hours; 74% worry that their savings will prove
inadequate for retirement; 91% feel firms have become less loyal to employees;
60% believe that the working atmosphere has become angrier and more than
three-quarters of the respondents had either been laid off or knew of a relative
or friend who had been so.

<P> The survey was not universally bleak. More than four out of five Bucknell
graduates felt economically secure and a similar number felt they were becoming
better off or staying the same. But for people at the top of the tree in what is
generally thought to be an optimistic country, their view of the future was often
negative. The graduates split 39%-39% on whether America's best years have
already gone and nearly three-quarters believe young people with a similar
educational background will find working life tougher.

<P> A poll by <I>The Observer</I> among British voters in May found a strikingly
similar picture. Nearly half those in the survey had lost a job, were working
longer hours, had taken a new job at lower pay or were on short-term contracts.
Only a third believed that finding a new job at the same salary would be easy.
Just one in six found it easier to plan their financial future.

<P> "The main lesson," according to the paper, "is that a huge gulf persists
between the economic state of the nation, as measured by the (mainly cheerful)
data from the government, and the economic mood of the people... This nervousness
affects all ages, regions and social classes. Past recessions have tended to have
a muted impact on the middle-class Tory heartlands of southern England... Today
[it] is a nationwide experience."

<P> Unsurprisingly, the debate has had little impact on the global march of
downsizers. The first country to mimic US trends was the UK, where American
management theories are never more than a jet ride away. It is now spreading to
continental Europe, long resistant to the Anglo-Saxon approach. When the French
household appliances group Moulinex recently announced it was laying off 20% of
its staff and suggested that products aimed at developing markets might be
produced overseas, a protest march in Mamers was led by a nine-year-old with a
banner reading, "My mum and dad don't have a factory any more".

<P> Faced with a choice between a child's <I>cri de coeur</I> and the baffling
phraseology of management-speak, the downsizers are likely to lose the wider
public debate. This is not helped by the related issue of perceived corporate
greed. In the public eye, top managers reward their own efforts with ever-larger
salaries.

<P> Figures vary, but one set of US statistics show the ratio between a chief
executive's pay and an average worker's has moved from 41-1 in the '70s to 187-1
last year. So powerful was the British campaign against the privatised gas
utility that the name of chief executive Cedric Brown became a by-word for
excess.

<P> The danger is that the public in democratic states is becoming ever more
cynical about business and the people who run it. The downsizing debate may have
been overdone, but the impression of mass lay-offs for the working population
combined with pay rises for a superclass at the top threatens to create a witch's
brew of popular bitterness.

<P> Such feelings may be a passing phenomenon. If Jacobs at Goldman Sachs is
right, profits in the US might level off close to their current share of national
income, downsizing abate and a growth of high-quality jobs remove the fear from
middle-class life. Whether the same will be true in the UK and the rest of Europe
is another matter: the EU's failure to create new jobs is well-documented. That
could leave politicians there under pressure to act, prompting a possible bout of
business regulation and even protection to ameliorate the effects of the market.

<P> It is only a matter of time before the world's successful businesses are
asked the question posed by John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, America's
biggest trades union movement: "Does a rising tide now sink all ships, except for
the luxury yachts?"

<H3> TRADING WITH THE ENEMY </H3> 

<H4> Europe is angry at new US rules that
attempt to enforce third-party trade sanctions on pariah states and threatens to
hit back. The lesson is that morality in global business should be used
sparingly, consistently and consensually. Charles Darwent on the story so far
</H4>

<P> For several months, everyone has watched with a growing sense of
disbelief as the world's two biggest trading blocs &#173; the US and the EU,
devout free-traders both &#173; squared up to each other for what could be a
bloody con&thorn;ict.

<P> In a US election year made even more panicky by the bomb at the Atlanta
Olympic games and crash of a jumbo jet near New York, Washington has reached for
the familiar weapon of the trade boycott to hit its favourite pariah states,
Cuba, Libya and Iran.

<P> But this time it is going much further, imposing its own sanctions policies
on other countries and conjuring up the unlikely vision of respectable business
executives from friendly states being banned from entering the US under the
banner of "trafficking" in stolen goods.

<P> This has prompted accusations of extraterritoriality, counter-measures and
the threat of a full-blown trade war that could entangle European and US
companies around the world. Critics also doubt if the measures will even succeed
in their stated aim of ending Middle East terrorism and Cuba's single-party rule.

<P> The details of both cases were in &thorn;ux at the time of writing, but they
raise questions of lasting importance. Could such laws set a precedent for future
sanctions legislation? Is there, as Brussels fears, an ulterior aim of curbing EU
trade? Do trade sanctions work? Should morality enter trade, and in what
circumstances?

<P> The main lesson from such an exercise is that while one should not rule out
the moral dimension from business and trade practice, it should be used sparingly
and consistently and should involve the consent of allies.

<P> The Cuban case, while hitting a smaller group of business interests, is the
most high-pro&THORN;le. This is partly because Cuba is still run on socialist
lines by that old anti-gringo Fidel Castro, who has made a career of defying
Uncle Sam and his embargoes.

<P> Although it no longer poses any real security threat, and human rights
violations there pale compared with other, bigger &THORN;sh, Cuba bothers US
politicians no end. Some are looking for a familiar enemy after the Soviet
Union's fall; others are courting the votes of Cuban exiles.

<P> When the proposed measures of the Helms-Burton Act were outlined in <I>World
Link</I> a year ago, most world trade experts and Cuban investors thought they
would not pass in their original, extreme form. They got a nasty shock when it
became law this May.

<P> Citing "continuing violations of fundamental human rights" by the Castro
government, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (Libertad) Act promoted
by Republican Senator Jesse Helms purports to "assist [the Cuban people] in a
decisive manner to end the tyranny that has oppressed them for 36 years". Since
it judges the international community to have shown "ethically improper conduct"
by continuing to do business with Castro, the new law aims to give the world a
quick lesson in ethics.

<P> The &THORN;rst lesson, Title III, allows foreign companies that are
"trafficking in" or otherwise bene&THORN;ting from the use of con&THORN;scated
properties in Cuba to be sued for restitution in US courts by their
pre-revolutionary owners. The second, Title IV, allows the executives of
companies doing business in Cuba to be denied US visas, a ban that has also been
extended to include their families.

<P> Among those already hit by this provision is Rupert Pennant-Rea, ex-editor of
<I>The Economist</I>, ex-deputy governor of the Bank of England and &#173; alas
for any US holiday plans the Pennant-Rea family might have had &#173; a director
of Sherritt International, a Canadian mining company with interests in Cuban
nickel.

<P> The D'Amato law aims to deter foreign investment in Iran and Libya, this time
in the name of &THORN;ghting international terrorism. Both countries have been
accused of sponsoring terror groups and Washington still says Libya bombed a US
aeroplane over Lockerbie, Scotland in December 1988. According to the law, any
foreign company investing more than $40 million in the energy sectors of either
Libya or Iran will &THORN;nd itself facing a range of sanctions aimed at hitting
its US business. Companies could also face the denial of US import licences, as
well as an embargo on loans from US banks.

<P> President Bill Clinton, told of European threats to retaliate against such
measures, made a comment that characterises Washington's logic when it has
decided to take the moral high ground: "Every advanced country is going to have
to make up its mind whether it can do business by day with people who fuel
attacks on innocent children by night."

<P> Such thinking, and the new law it has fostered, has caused outrage in Europe.
In part it is venal: the sanctions are tougher and the investment sums involved
are potentially much larger than those in Cuba's case. In part it is injured
<I>amour propre</I>. But it is also a principled objection to US policy.

<P> "Let it not be forgotten that Europe has been the hardest hit by terrorist
actions allegedly carried out with the support of these two countries," says
Peter Guilford, spokesman for EU trade minister Sir Leon Brittan. "The EU is
highly sensitive to the threat of terrorism and will not shirk its
responsibilities in &THORN;ghting it. We happen nonetheless to believe that
passing extraterritorial laws that strike America's friends is by no means the
best way of achieving such an objective."

<P> Europe has much to lose. Each year, for example, Italy imports more than 44%
of its oil from Libya and Iran, and the Italian energy company Agip has
signi&THORN;cant new natural gas investment planned in Libya. Britain, France,
Spain and Germany also have commercial interests in one or the other country.

<P> The main complaint against both laws is over extraterritoriality, which
arises whenever a country unilaterally tries to impose its legal will on the
institutions of another. It has been regarded as unacceptable since the Arab
boycott of foreign &THORN;rms doing business with Israel in the '50s, when the US
vehemently denied the moral propriety of such strong-arm tactics.

<P> Another issue, arising in Cuba, is over expropriations. Even in Iran
compensation for seized American property was agreed between the two governments,
as customary in international law, without involving private business. The Castro
government has signalled that it will discuss the issue even if it cannot repay
the estimated $6 billion involved. It is Washington that refuses to talk. Time is
another factor: when do you draw the line under the past? To make this point, two
Canadian opposition parliamentarians have proposed a tongue-in-cheek bill seeking
compensation from Washington for Canadian land lost to the US as a result of the
1775 War of Independence.

<P> "The real trouble here is that there is nothing actually illegal in what the
Americans are doing," says Jagdish Bhagwati, Indian-born professor of economics
at New York's Columbia University and long-time scourge of American trade policy.
"If they want to be bitchy, no one can stop them. So what if America decides to
deny visas to some European executives? The World Trade Organisation (WTO) can
scream its head off if it likes, but there is nothing it can really do about it."

<P><B> Exemptions to free-trade rules </B> <P> In any case, the WTO's free-trade
rules make a speci&THORN;c exception for cases where their imposition might
constitute a threat to national security. It is a waiver likely to be claimed
under the D'Amato law against Libya and Iran. The Helms-Burton Act contends that
the Cuban government poses a national security threat, although the WTO might
question this when Cuba's MiGs only have enough fuel to get airborne on special
occasions.

<P> Even if America's new extraterritorial legislation is not illegal, experts
are still troubled by its apparent &thorn;outing of the norms of international
law. Ruth Wedgwood, Yale professor of law and senior fellow at the US Council on
Foreign Relations, pointed out in a recent letter to <I>The Financial Times</I>
that the Helms-Burton Act's improbably broad de&THORN;nition of the word
"trafficking" means that the foreign businessman who haplessly buys a tonne of
sugar from an expropriated Cuban sugar re&THORN;nery may &THORN;nd himself being
sued in an American court not simply for the cost of the sugar in question but
for the entire value of the re&THORN;nery that made it.

<P> "One of the standards set up by the American Law Institute is that
jurisdiction to prescribe should depend on reasonableness," Wedgwood tells
<I>World Link</I>. "Can any law that allows for compensation so out of proportion
to commercial activity really be held to be reasonable?" Whether or not it can,
US courts are unlikely to be swayed by any appeal to extraterritorial
reasonableness. "Their answer would be 'Sorry &#173; that's not our business',"
Wedgwood says. "A court might chide a piece of legislation gently for breaking
international law, but that is about as far as it would go."

<P> Even so, the new rule may not be unassailable. "Generally, US courts are
loath to cast their nets abroad because of the right for due process under the
Sixth Amendment," Wedgwood says. "We're talking about foreign property that is
being penalised here, in the US. If I were the lawyer for a foreign company, I
would certainly argue that was unconstitutional."

<P> European indignation is freshly exercised, but Bhagwati has seen all this
before. "The idea that it has virtue on its side has always been basic to the US
approach to trade, and Americans have never hesitated to enforce what they see as
obligations by the use of threat," he says. "Look at the Japanese luxury-car
dispute, where [Washington] threatened a 100% penal tax to get Japan to
capitulate. Just imagine what would have happened on Capitol Hill if France's
computer industry had persuaded the French government to zero in on IBM in the
same way."

<P> His advice to those who stand to be hit hardest by the latest punitive
measures is the same as the advice he gave to the Japanese government. "I would
like to see the EU rap the US over the knuckles really hard on this one &#173;
refuse visas to brothers, sisters, grandparents, everyone. Nafta isn't going to
do it: Mexico's just had to &THORN;nd $7 billion to help Clinton out, and Canada
is no longer the Canada of [the assertive former prime minister] Pierre Trudeau,
unfortunately. So someone else will have to stand up to them, and it's got to be
the EU."

<P> At the time of writing, there is every indication that Bhagwati will get his
wish. An unexpectedly belligerent Brussels was planning to have a retaliatory law
on its books by October, when foreign ministers hold their next meeting. European
Union trade minister Sir Leon Brittan has already stated that this blocking
statute &#173; originally aimed just at the Helms-Burton Act &#173; will be
extended to include the anti-Libya legislation as well.

<P> Sir Leon also speaks of giving his American trade counterparts "a rap on the
knuckles". This action could include provisions prohibiting European companies
from complying with US extraterritorial legislation and entitling them to
counter-sue in European courts for damages awarded against them in the US.

<P> A tit-for-tat refusal of visas for US executives wishing to visit Europe
seems likely. The EU's executive Commission has already agreed to call on
European companies to compile a "watch list" of US companies or individuals that
&THORN;le lawsuits against them. The end result is that companies based in the US
that observe the new sanctions, caught between Scylla and Charybdis, could
&THORN;nd it difficult to conduct business almost anywhere else in the world.

<P> A compromise is still possible, given Clinton's well-known penchant for
changing his mind. After the unexpected volume of sabre-rattling emanating from
Brussels this summer, the president executed what <I>The Economist</I> tartly
dubbed "the most slippery Clinton wriggle for a while": signing the Helms Bill
into law to placate Cuban-American voters on the one hand, he simultaneously
waived its punitive Title III provisions for six months in order to lower
temperatures in Brussels on the other.

<P> If, as seems probable, Clinton is re-elected in November there may be less
pressure on him to appear gung-ho on foreign-policy issues. Congress is unlikely
to repeal the two new laws, however the president could avoid their most
troublesome provisions by waiving them inde&THORN;nitely. After all, Wedgwood
recalls, "The Trading with the Enemy Act that forbade US trade with North Korea
was actually extended at six-month intervals for 40 long years."

<P> Even if this expedient cools tempers in the short term, broader issues of US
extraterritorial legislation will remain. The current six-month suspension, for
example, applies only to the right to sue and not to the provision barring
executives from the US. In any case, punitive measures still act as a deterrent
to potential investors as they can be reinstated at any time.

<P><B> Work for the lawyers </B> <P> In the meantime companies are expected to
&THORN;nd ways around the rules, providing more proof for those who argue that
extraterritorial law-making does not work. Wedgwood suggests, for example, that
foreign companies with interests in Libya and Iran will be able to get around the
D'Amato law's $40 million cap simply by staggering their investments.

<P> And although the Helms-Burton Act has registered the odd triumph, its
principal effect has been to force companies to dodge its provisions by
restructuring themselves out of the US market. The principal bene&THORN;ciaries
have not been the Cuban people but corporate lawyers.

<P> A de&THORN;ant Cuba enjoys pointing out the loopholes. In an interview with
<I>The Financial Times</I> recently, vice president Carlos Lage admitted that the
new penalties added to potential investor risk and created a &THORN;nancing
squeeze for Havana but insisted that companies were &THORN;nding ways around the
problem.

<P> Parrying questions about the reported pull-out of the Mexican giant Cemex,
for example, he said the real business partner was another institution and "the
joint company is continuing to operate". Equally, although the Dutch-based
investment giant ING has said it would discontinue a &THORN;nancing contract for
two sugar-growing provinces in Cuba, Lage said that the bank is still maintaining
its operations.

<P> Nor is the potential ineffectiveness of the punitive measures merely
practical: there is the psychological factor. In short, attempting to enforce
agreement at the point of an economic gun has a marked tendency to make
governments do precisely the opposite of what they are told. With the popularity
of the boycott tactic still alive and perhaps growing, it is a lesson likely to
need repeating.

<H3> Hong Kong </H3> 

<H4> The impending transfer of sovereignty in the territory from Britain to China
will provide stern challenges to Asia's leading entrep&ocirc;t city. But Hong
Kong has faced a series of tough choices in recent years and has invariably
exceeded expectations. From vast infrastructure programmes like the new airport
to the export of investment and know-how, it is gearing up for change  </H4>

<A NAME="bulls"></A><H3> Bulls and bears </H3> 

<H4> Changes affecting business around the world mean more to Hong Kong's future than the transfer of sovereignty </H4> 

<I> By Gareth Hewett </I>

<P> The pessimistic view about Hong Kong's future was best
summed-up in the cover article of the US financial magazine <I>Fortune</I> last
summer. The author of "The Death of Hong Kong" said the territory was was due to
be relegated to the status of global backwater after the handover to China next
June.

<P> "The naked truth about Hong Kong's future can be summed up in two words: it's
over," he wrote. "Troops of the People's Liberation Army, which has already
formed links with powerful local criminal gangs known as 'triads', will stroll
the streets," after the British withdrawal, he added.

<P> Most people would probably accept there is a lot of uncertainty in Hong Kong,
especially in the political arena. But this should be seen in a regional context.
Since 1984, the date of the Sino-British treaty agreeing the transfer to Chinese
rule, there has been a revolution in the Philippines (1986), a massacre in
Beijing (1989), the threat of war between North and South Korea and between China
and Taiwan.

<P> There were riots in Bangkok (in 1992) and in Jakarta this August. If
political uncertainty is what you want, the Asia-Pacific region has a lot on
offer. But of course Hong Kong has a political sell-by date and that opens up
vast new areas for speculation.

<P><B> Reasons to be wary </B> <P> The debate has divided people into two camps,
best described as the optimist bulls and the pessimist bears. The bears all make
a number of similar points, according to Morgan Stanley Asia's managing director
of research, Peter Churchouse. They believe that the dollar peg will break,
inflation is wiping out the territory's international competitiveness, trading
performance is on the slide and the current uncertainty will only worsen as the
handover looms. Finally, they say, doubts linger about China's commitment to the
rule of law. Mixed with corruption and heavy-handed economic intervention, this
could create a cocktail of disaster. The bears have representatives not only
among the foreign community and opinion-formers outside the territory, but also
among those Hong Kong Chinese who have already left the territory. This is the
strain which most influences portrayals of the colony's post-1997 prospects in
the international media.

<P> Churchouse sides with the bulls, arguing that the pessimists have failed to
comprehend fully both China's crucial role in Hong Kong's development and its
reliance on China in the future. The days when Hong Kong could be viewed as a
foreign enclave pinned onto a hostile mainland are long gone, he argues: "Instead
we believe Hong Kong should be considered as the capital city of a sub-region of
perhaps 100 million people, a region that has been growing at [more than] 10% a
year for a decade."

<P> Proponents of the bull scenario focus on the economic story. They tend to be
people in the Hong Kong Chinese business community who either have big
investments in Hong Kong or China, or are members of the expatriate community
planning to live in the territory after the handover.

<P> They have a strong case in arguing that Hong Kong's future can be divined
from its past. The territory has been voted the world's freest economy and has
one of the highest GDP per capita on a purchasing power parity basis. Real
economic growth has been strong for decades and unemployment is historically low.
According to surveys it is the fourth leading financial centre in the world, the
eighth leading trading economy, the 11th largest exporter of commercial services
and it has the third largest positive trade balance. In 1994 it was the largest
inward recipient of foreign direct investment flows, as measured as a percentage
of GDP, and the largest exporter of FDI.

<P> This progress is all the more startling given Hong Kong's origins.
Historically, it has served as a trading entrep&ocirc;t from the time of the
earliest formal British settlement in 1841. Modern Hong Kong really began to take
shape when it became a sanctuary for successive waves of mainland emigrants and
refugees following the communist revolution in 1949.

<P> Hang Seng Bank chairman Sir Quo Wei Lee argues, "Between 1949 and the late
'50s, there was a continuous influx of capital, technology and talent from the
mainland which led to our industrial development. The environment was favourable:
rising incomes, low tax and a stable convertible currency."

<P> At first Hong Kong made its name in manufacturing cheap goods and textiles
became a key industry. From the mid-70s its development has been characterised by
the need to adapt to globalising markets and the erosion of its enclave status as
China began to open up to the outside world. This allowed Hong Kong's
manufacturing sector to relocate to mainland China, the main economic
transformation in the last decade. Since then, Hong Kong has laid a boxful of
golden eggs.

<P> Anything which threatens this is obviously a matter of concern to the
business community. Of greater concern, however, are a whole series of issues
unrelated to the swapping of flags in 1997. This view is best expressed in the
Political &amp; Economic Risk Consultancy bi-monthly journal recently: "There is
so much speculation about how Hong Kong will be changed by the 1997 transition
that too little attention is being given to the factors that could also have a
profound impact on the business environment in the longer term. If you want to
have an idea of what Hong Kong will look like a decade from now, it is probably
wise to think about the global forces shaping major industries and how these
forces could change the situation in Hong Kong." Among such key trends are the
further opening up of China's economy and the development of a competitive
services sector, as trade barriers are rolled back.

<P> To illustrate the issues, take a look at the banking sector. Paul Proudfoot
of the risk consultancy says: "The change to Chinese sovereignty is interesting,
but few bankers are [as worried] about this as they are about how technological
change promises to remake the entire global banking industry."

<P> Hong Kong is developing as a key hub for a whole range of products and
services. The UN annual investment report singles it out as the biggest Asian
player in FDI. The average outflow of foreign direct investment between 1983 and
1988 was $1.45 billion. This more than doubled<B> </B>to $2.3 billion in 1990,
hit $3 billion in 1991 and reached $7.3 billion in 1992. In 1993, the figure
soared to $17.45 billion in 1993 and $20.95 billion in 1994, the fifth highest
figure in the world. Singapore, by contrast, managed only $650 million in 1994.
Outward investment stock in Hong Kong rose to $60 billion in 1994 from just $2.34
billion in 1985.

<P> At the same time inward investment stock, representing the accumulated value
of the inward investment flow, reached $19.6 billion compared to $3.5 billion in
1985. The investment flow out of the territory incorporates net outward
investment by Hong Kong companies along with outward investment by foreign
companies using Hong Kong as a platform. Much of the money headed for China. In
1994, Hong Kong was the biggest investor in China.

<P> But the colony is more than an investment centre. It is also a trading hub. A
report by Kurt Salmon Associates commissioned by the territory's government
pinpointed soft goods, saying it supplied $50 billion or 10% of all textiles,
clothing and footwear to the world's major markets. Hong Kong soft goods
companies have the firepower to finance large-scale manufacturing activities for
customers in North America and Europe. "Thus Hong Kong companies have been able
to offer their western customers a reliable means to transact business that
provides access to the attractive low cost and large capacity of the Chinese
soft-goods manufacturing sector," the report says.

<P> The territory has developed a strategic core competence in the global
international trade value chain. This has enabled the territory to handle a level
of business far beyond its domestic capacity or geographical borders.

<P> A survey by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council of 2,510 companies found
that 39% exported goods produced in Hong Kong and 81% exported goods produced in
China. More importantly over a third exported goods produced in third countries.
According to the survey, the estimated total value of unrecorded offshore export
business by Hong Kong companies was HK$655 billion ($84 billion) in 1994,
equivalent to 70% of the territory's re-exports that year.

<P><B> Reasons to be cheerful </B> <P> What the report shows is that Hong Kong
companies are becoming more efficient through a combination of investment
overseas, cost-cutting and by using Hong Kong as an efficient central processing
hub. There are 1,850 multinationals with offices in the territory. Of this, 700
are regional headquarters. More than 92% of companies surveyed in trade and
manufacturing said they would keep their headquarters in the territory.

<P> The Trade Development Council emphasises that as a global middleman, Hong
Kong's role is not in danger of diminishing because its transnational
corporations have built up expertise in their sector. For a customer they will
handle financing, insurance and freight and will even act as principal through
the acquisition of goods, from the manufacturer to the final end-user.

<P> What all this wealth of survey data indicates is that, while there is a
tremendous amount of uncertainty about Hong Kong's prospects post-1997, there are
also good reasons for optimism. Despite the rising costs of doing business, the
territory continues its evolution into a global Mr Fixit in international trade.

<A NAME="asia"></A><H3> Asia's money machine </H3>

<H4> Britain is leaving $47 billion in the kitty and future growth from two-way
investment looks quite likely </H4>  

<I> By Keith Wallis </I>

<P> Some ofAsia's tallest skyscrapers now stand like giants in Hong Kong, a far cry from the
"barren rock with hardly a house upon it" that British foreign secretary Lord
Palmerston described 150 years ago at the start of British rule.

<P> This is now a territory sweating money from every pore. With all land owned
by the government, each time a site is auctioned, a portion of the sum paid by
developers goes into the official land fund. The barren rock has become a rich
piece of real estate earning the Hong Kong authorities $26 billion in land
premiums.

<P> Combined with other fiscal reserves, China's new "special autonomous region
government" will inherit more than $47 billion from the old colonial
administration on July 1, 1997. This is almost 15 times the $3.3 billion Britain
had promised to leave in the kitty.

<P> There are losers. Despite a public housing programme which produces about
40,000 new homes a year, some 3,000 old men and women still live in tiny wire
cages. Such conditions have been condemned by the UN Human Rights Commission, but
the government says it has no resources to help. More than half of all public
housing is being sold to broaden private ownership, even though buildings erected
before 1970 were poorly constructed and poorly maintained.

<P> In fairness, many of the territory's problems stem from its success. In the
'60s it was a quiet backwater known for cheap toys, a corrupt police force and
girly bars. Before 1972, when the first cross-harbour road tunnel was completed,
vehicles had to use ferries across Victoria Harbour, the 1,600m-wide natural port
that separates the main urban areas on Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. And until
the metro system opened in the early '80s the only way to go from one end of the
island to the other was by bus or antiquated tram, a journey which took several
hours.

<P> Deng Xiaoping's "open door" policy in the '80s spurred development of the
territory's huge container port complex at Kwai Chung, now approaching full
capacity. Last year Hong Kong was the world's busiest container port. Some 80% of
all traffic came from China, the result of burgeoning industrial expansion in
Guangdong and other southern Chinese provinces.

<P><B> Expanding circles of growth </B> <P> Tony Clark, a senior official with
Hong Kong's Port Development Board, expects container volumes to grow by 250% in
the next 10 years. "Handling that demand will mean building a new four-berth
container terminal every two years for the next 20 years," he says.

<P> Two years ago the neighbouring Guangdong economy was growing by 25% a year
and although the annual rise has cooled to about 10%, experts believe this level
of growth will be sustained for at least the next 20 years. Indeed the booming
economy of southern China is spurring development further north as companies
search for cheaper sites in Hunan, Fujian and Hubei provinces.

<P> "The early pioneers who moved across the border from Hong Kong 15-20 years
ago are now finding its too expensive in Guangdong. They are moving further north
where land and labour is cheaper," says one expert.

<P> Rapid development in southern China has fuelled investment in both
directions. The most recent flagship deal was reached in June when the China
National Aviation Corporation took a controlling 35.85% stake in Hong Kong Dragon
Airlines (Dragonair), one of Hong Kong's three air carriers. The CNAC paid nearly
$255 million to Dragonair's major stakeholders: Swire, Cathay Pacific Airways and
CITIC Pacific, the Chinese government's main overseas investment vehicle. Wang
Guixiang, the head of CNAC, became Dragonair chairman and CITIC spent almost $816
million increasing its stake in Cathay Pacific from 10% to 25%.

<P> The ramifications were far wider than in normal share deals. It signalled a
shift of changing economic fortunes every bit as significant as next year's
political handover. The deal ended a 50-year dominance in the airline industry by
Swire, the British <I>hong</I> (trading company) which founded Cathay and
Dragonair. It also showed that mainland companies are now the young turks, keen
to claim their inheritance.

<P> The future of both air carriers had been under a cloud for more than a year
since it became clear CNAC was planning to start its own Hong Kong-based airline.
Swire did not want a repeat of the situation faced by another British
<I>hong</I>, Jardine Matheson, which has been virtually blackballed by China
since it moved to the Caribbean in 1984 amid post-handover fears.

<P> Other companies without the same ties of British blood and history, like the
electricity generator China Light &amp; Power, have had considerable success on
the mainland. It has invested heavily in power stations across the border, partly
as an investment and partly to guarantee power supplies to the territory. The
latest deal is a $2.3 billion agreement to build China's largest coal-fired power
station complex using foreign partners. Plant will be built in three different
cities by the Shandong China Light Power Electricity Company, 29% owned by
CL&amp;P. The firm is also competing for the $600 million Laibin B power station
in Guangzi Zhuang autonomous region, in south-west China. The CL&amp;P is jointly
operating the Daya Bay nuclear station east of Hong Kong and a pumped-storage
hydro-electric station at Changshu.

<P> Hutchison Whampoa has recently increased its stake in China Strategic
Holdings, which co-ordinates investment on the mainland. Hutchinson, one of Hong
Kong's largest conglomerates, has extensive interests in China including
container terminals, infrastructure and retail outlets.

<P> Hopewell Holdings, created in 1972 by civil engineer Gordon Wu Ying-sheung,
was one of the first investors, building the Shajiao B coal-fired power station
as one of the first privatised build-own-operate projects in China. Once a
darling of the Chinese government, Wu's star has waned as a result of massive
cost overruns and delays on his 123km superhighway between Hong Kong and
Guangzhou. Problems have also dogged his Shajiao C power plant near Guangzhou.

<P> A recent research report by Credit Lyonnaise shows Hong Kong companies are
set to invest more than $18 billion in the next three to four years. Analysts see
this continuing at least into the early part of the century, although Credit
Lyonnaise says companies tend to reduce their exposure by keeping a low asset
value. "The ability to cooperate and coordinate with Chinese authorities to
expedite project approvals is hugely valuable" says Credit Lyonnaise analyst
Randall Gilbert.

<P> But despite the public optimism shown by many local firms, there are still
doubts. Last October Li Ka-shing and a group of entrepreneurs launched the Better
Hong Kong Foundation to "express and encourage confidence in Hong Kong" in the
years beyond the coming handover. It was later revealed that Li had moved his
personal stake in Cheung Kong (Holdings), worth more than $360 million, to the
Cayman Islands "for personal reasons". Tsang Hin-chi, head of Goldlion, has his
personal shareholdings registered in Nauru, a tiny Pacific island.

<P><B> Hope for best, prepare for worst </B> <P> For ordinary people, next year's
union of capitalism and communism is extremely worrying. There was a time at the
height of the pro-democracy movement in the late '80s when business leaders said
Hong Kong people were too busy making money to be interested in democracy.

<P> That changed almost overnight with the Tiananmen Square massacre when Chinese
troops killed and injured hundreds of protesters in Beijing on June 4, 1989.
Thousands of people have marked the occasion every year with a candle-lit vigil
in the colony: further protests are under threat come the transition.

<P> Thousands of fearful Hong Kongers have travelled to Canada, Australia and the
US to work for two years until they are eligible for a second passport. With this
safety net in place they have returned, rejoining friends and family to continue
their lives.

<P> Carl Chu Ka-shing is typical of the many small businessman who hope for the
best but also fears the worst. Educated at London's Imperial College, he is the
managing director of a building firm turning over about $5 million a year. He has
modest investments on the mainland, as he says, "to put something back into the
motherland". He also has a full British passport which he says he will only use
in an emergency. "Where will I go? Hong Kong is my home. If I go to England what
will I do? If I try to set up a building company I face opposition for being
Chinese," he says.

<P> Many people like Chu are extremely concerned for the future, not because they
fear a catastrophic overnight collapse, but because they worry about a more
insidious breakdown in social order. People compare Hong Kong with Shenzhen
immediately across the border where they see a town with rampant crime, pollution
and mounting inflation. These concerns are compounded by reports of the 10,000
People's Liberation Army soldiers due to be stationed in the territory. Locals
fear that the low-paid soldiers may be corrupted by the bright lights and vast
wealth that exists in the territory.

<P> The outgoing establishment seems optimistic, however. "The foundation stone
of the present bullish forecasts is the view that the new sovereign will want to
ensure the territory performs well beyond July 1," says Ian Perkin assistant
director of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. "It is difficult to argue
with this view."

 <A NAME="future"></A><H3> Future foundations </H3>
 
<H4> The city is awash with ambitious
infrastructure plans, however only a few of them have China's crucial blessing
</H4> 

<I>By Keith Wallis </I> 

<P> Next year promises to be more than a
political watershed for Hong Kong when it reverts to Chinese control after more
than 150 years of British colonial rule. Contractors, including many foreign
companies, are predicting an uncertain future once the territory's $20 billion
Chek Lap Kok airport and related reclamation, road and rail projects are
completed."It's worrying. The Hong Kong government has put on an optimistic face,
talking everything up, but the reality is that nobody knows what's going to
happen," comments one construction boss.

<P> The Hong Kong Construction Association (HKCA), which represents about 350
local and international contractors in the territory, agrees. It says that
although several mega-projects are on the drawing board there is no certainty
they will go ahead.

<P> "The government has big plans in hand including the Western Corridor Railway,
ports, sewage improvements and housing," says Patrick Chan Wing-tung, secretary
general of the HKCA. "Putting political issues aside, there should not be a
sudden stop. But it's difficult to say what will happen."

<P><B> Opposition from China, environmentalists </B> <P> Follow-on projects,
including the $10 billion Western Corridor Railway and the $5 billion north
Lantau port development, are under a cloud following opposition from local
environmentalists and from China. Engineering and architectural consultants are
unlikely to be as badly hit as contractors, because most have already been paid.
Many of the locally based firms are the subsidiaries of British and foreign
consultants with extensive overseas interests.

<P> Cracks began to appear in the grand infrastructure plan last year when
Winston Chu Ka-sun, a prominent solicitor, enlisted the help of independent
legislator Christine Loh Kung-wai to curb the authorities' massive reclamation
plans. Chu, with popular support, helped Loh introduce a harbour protection bill
into the local parliament or Legislative Council. If approved it will severely
curtail government plans to reclaim more than 630 hectares of waterfront on Hong
Kong Island and Kowloon to provide land for future developments, including two
container terminals at north Lantau. Public anger has already been stirred up
after the filling-in of more than 600 hectares of the territory's picturesque
harbour needed for the airport-related projects.

<P> Chu argues that the opposition coming from Beijing is not mere posturing
against the colonial regime and support for infrastructure projects could
evaporate once the new administration is installed next July.

<P> The current government has already been forced to postpone the initial
segment, the 190-hectare Green Island reclamation, pending further studies.
Beijing says Hong Kong's secretary for planning, environment and lands, Bowen
Leung Poving, broke his pledge that there would be no new reclamation before the
handover. There also seems to be some scepticism about the colonial government's
argument that the Green Island scheme was for a public dump, not reclamation.
"This [postponement] is a completely reasonable request and is good for the
preservation of Hong Kong's natural resources and long-term interests," says a
senior official at China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.

<P> The Green Island scheme is not an isolated project: it seen as a key element
in the high-profile plan to build a road from the western end of Hong Kong Island
to the north Lantau port. Board secretary Tony Clark insists that the territory
will lose $10 billion between 1997 and 2011 if the first two port areas,
container terminals 10 and 11, are not constructed on schedule.

<P><B> Crying wolf for growth </B> <P> All the same, critics believe the board
has cried wolf once too often and has over-estimated the need for additional
berths. Jeremy Marriott, the managing director of ferry company HKR
International, says officials several years ago predicted the collapse of the
territory's trading status if terminals 10 and 11 did not start this year. "This
simply hasn't happened. Operators have become more efficient and ports have
developed along the coast of southern China," he says. Instead, as Clark admits,
productivity at the Kwai Chung container port complex has soared 30% in the past
18 months following the introduction of new equipment and working practices.

<P> China, upset at a lack of consultation, has also voiced its opposition to the
Western Corridor Railway, a 53km heavy rail link from Hong Kong's current main
port area at Kwai Chung to the border. The scheme is being promoted by the
Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, the territory's only heavy rail operator.

<P> It has not yet received the full development go-ahead but it has planned 20
technical studies covering route alignment, environmental impact and other
matters. Chinese officials, fearing a <I>fait accompli</I> similar to the airport
debacle, made it clear that any engineering contracts would be cancelled after
the handover if there is no consultation.

<P> The political crisis was only diffused when Governor Chris Patten stepped in,
telling KCRC that the nine most critical studies could go ahead but the remainder
would have to wait. Despite Patten's intervention there has still been widespread
opposition, amid concerns about the project's huge cost and scale.

<P> Estimates of the cost of construction and finance have risen from $10 billion
to nearly $13 billion, which would make it Hong Kong's most expensive railway
ever. Land purchase alone will take five years to complete which the government
admits would delay the scheme beyond the anticipated 2001 completion date. Even
engineers, who have most to gain from the studies, have proposed three cheaper
alternatives which they say would better link Hong Kong's port with China's main
Pearl River harbour at Shekou.

<P> Wang Liang Huew, chairman of the China-backed Hong Kong Institute for
Infrastructure Development, says there have been no talks on the issue with the
neighbouring Shenzhen government. "According to the KCRC plans, the railway goes
through the middle of Shenzhen. But KCRC has not yet discussed its proposals with
the Shenzhen authorities. It is ludicrous," he says.

<P> In an effort to deflect criticism HSBC Investment Bank Asia, the
corporation's financial advisers, say the government will reap about $130 billion
in land revenue and dividends from rail revenue by 2034. Passenger traffic is
expected to reach 260,000 a day by 2011.

<P><B> Re-run of the airport saga </B> <P> The wrangle threatens to become a
re-run of the Chek Lap Kok airport saga. Britain and China fought for more than
five years before they could reach an agreement after the then governor, Sir
David Wilson, announced the massive scheme with much fanfare in 1989.

<P> Britain saw the airport and nine related projects as the key to Hong Kong's
continued economic survival. It had become clear that the existing Kai Tak
airport had reached its saturation level of 30 million passengers. Revised
traffic forecasts recently published by the airport authority show that 35
million passengers are expected<B> </B>to use Chek Lap Kok when it opens in April
1998. The Authority says this will grow to 56 million passengers by 2010.

<P> Whatever the economic reasoning, China remains suspicious and angry at the
lack of advance warning. Beijing counters that the infrastructure plans are a
massive drain on the financial reserves of the future special autonomous regional
government. It also accuses Britain of rewarding its own construction and
manufacturing companies.

<P> In fact Japanese industry has benefited most from the airport core programme.
With all the large bridge, road and rail contracts awarded, Japanese contractors
have scooped 27% of the $12 billion worth of orders let so far.

<P> Hong Kong companies come second with 23% of the work. By comparison British
outfits come third with<B> </B>16%. But even this figure could be an
over-estimate because several UK contractors have withdrawn from their contracts.
For example, Alfred McAlpine International won a $336 million contract in the
middle of last year to build the airport's runway and taxiways in a joint venture
with a local firm, but pulled out six months later because of a corporate
decision to end work abroad.

<P> The lack<B> </B>of effective consultation between the Hong Kong and Chinese
administrations is creating an air of uncertainty. Hong Kong officials are
merrily proposing projects without the slightest idea whether they will continue
come July next year. A cross-border infrastructure committee set up by both sides
appears to be a talking shop and seems to lack the ability to coordinate
development.

<P> But that has done little to stop some highly ambitious private plans for the
post-colonial era. One was unveiled recently by David Li Kwok-po, chief executive
of the Bank of East Asia and a member of the preparatory committee, China's
shadow government in Hong Kong. This was Pearl City, a megacity which would
connect the 24,000 sq km and 40 million people of Hong Kong, Macau and several
Chinese cities including Guangzhou (Canton) and Shenzhen. "It is one of the
largest, richest urban areas of the world... (with a) gross domestic product of
$800 billion a year. Pearl City's infrastructure is the envy of the world," he
says.

<P><B> Effects of uncertainty </B> <P> But before the concept can become a
reality it will need an unprecedented level of coordination and joint planning
among central, provincial and local governments. "Think about the current
administration structures for the [Pearl] Delta region," he says. "They do little
to promote coordination. These communities are so near and yet so far apart".

<P> Uncertainty is having other effects. Chan, secretary general of the
Construction Association, says that it is causing larger contractors to look
further afield, regionalising their businesses as a bulwark against any local
downturn. Large firms which have invested heavily in China, including Hopewell
Holdings and Cheung Kong, owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing, are also looking for
work elsewhere.

<P> Representatives from a number of top firms recently accompanied Hong Kong's
financial secretary Donald Tsang Yam-kuen on a tour of several member-countries
of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) to promote their expertise
in the region.

<P> One construction boss has even gone so far as to demand official government
help to win business. Chan Ka-kui, the managing director of Hsin Chong
Construction, would like the government to pay for trade missions and market
research: "Quite a few contractors &#173; such as Hsin Chong, Shui On, Gammon and
Hip Hing &#173; have reached a size where they are capable of competing
internationally."

<P> Hong Kong's rapid development, especially the experience gained on
airport-related construction, gives local firms a competitive edge in the region,
he adds. "Being a contractor anywhere is tough, but I do feel that if the
construction industry gets together &#173; developers, professionals and
contractors &#173; we do have a lot to sell," he says. "Our experience of
mega-projects shows we can deliver projects on time and within budgets, which is
something we can capitalise on."

<P><B> Cooperate and survive </B> <P> Taking this view into account, the
territory's largest contractor Gammon Construction has embarked on a long-term
programme to create the region's biggest building group. "We've been
regionalising the business because we were banging our head on the ceiling in
Hong Kong," said Martin Hadaway, Gammon's group chief executive.

<P> The firm recently picked up a $202 million contract to build Singapore's
first automated light rail system in a joint venture with the German engineering
group AdTranz and the island-state's Keppel Integrated Engineering. Hadaway said
the partnership will be maintained for similar rail projects in the region.
Gammon, which had a turnover of $850 million last year, has linked up with blue
chip clients in selected Asian countries. The most recent tie-up was with a
Filipino company, Ayala Land based in Manila.

<P> Hsin Chong's Chan also stresses Hong Kong contractors' natural language
advantage against overseas competitors trying to win work in Asia. "We have the
language skills so we can communicate with clients who initiate projects," he
says: only Japanese firms, with an enormous foreign workload, can rival Hong Kong
companies.

<A NAME="china"></A><H3>China calling </H3>

<P> <H4> The telecom monopoly faces greater
competition and ownership dilution, but China offers a tempting market </H4>  

<I>By Keith Wallis </I>

<P> If the speculation is right Hongkong Telecom (HKT), one
of the territory's biggest monopolies, will become the next blue-chip company to
fall victim to raids by mainland Chinese shareholders anxious to increase their
holding before the handover of power.

<P> After the recent upheaval at Hong Kong Dragon Airlines (Dragonair) that saw
Chinese companies take a controlling stake, HKT has been identified as the next
likely target. This gained extra credence just as ink was being put to the
Dragonair agreements in June when CITIC Pacific, China's overseas investment arm,
sold Telecom shares worth $388 million to a mystery buyer. Rumours intensified
when CITIC refused to allow HKT to reveal the identity of the buyer.

<P> The sell-off comes at a particularly uncertain time for HKT, just a month
before merger talks collapsed between Cable &amp; Wireless &#173; which owns a
controlling 58% stake in the company &#173; and British Telecom. The $50 billion
"deal of the decade" apparently fell apart because the two sides could not agree
a price. But British Telecom was also wary of what would happen to HKT after next
year's handover.

<P> Deregulation of the telecommunications market in Hong Kong is already putting
pressure on Hongkong Telecom's traditional monopoly. The firm is facing tough
competition from a new generation of local operators and it has been forced to
enter a price war on international telephone call charges to maintain market
share.

<P> Recently Telecom posted a 14.4% increase in pre-tax profits for 1995-96 to
$1.48 billion, but chief executive Linus Cheung Wing-lam admits it has been a
year of change and pressure. The firm's international call revenue growth was 70%
lower than the figure for 1994-95.

<P> A greater threat looms. In 2006, HKT will be forced to surrender its monopoly
on international telephone lines and the company is negotiating a compensation
package with the government for the expected loss of business. Experts estimate
HKT is seeking anything from $260 million to $650 million. Part of that could be
paid in kind, as concessions to redevelop buildings and liberalise prices. The
company has already warned customers that they will be charged for currently free
local calls.

<P> The firm was dealt a further blow at the end of July when it failed to win
tenders for any of six new mobile telephone network licences. The company offered
a rate of about 26 cents a minute. The government's regulatory agency, the Office
of the Telecommunications Authority, was unimpressed, since other bidders
suggested tariffs of 10-13 cents a minute.

<P> The increasingly difficult domestic market has encouraged the company to
examine prospects elsewhere and it is set to pounce as telecom deregulation rolls
across Asia. The firm's mobile telephone company, HKTCSL, has already begun to
offer some services in China. In July HKT became the first foreign company with a
mainland shareholder to invest in Taiwan when it took a 26% stake in Taiwan
Telecommunications Network Services. This investment followed similar
acquisitions in Singapore, South Korea and Japan.

<P> This shift may also run into political trouble. While financiers feel the
company has the muscle for further significant investments, it seems certain this
would require the support of mainland partners given next year's handover.

<P> China has yet to say how it will react to British firms continuing to own key
companies after the change of sovereignty, but there is a general sense that some
dilution will be necessary. International brokerage firm Merrill Lynch recently
said HKT would greatly benefit from the introduction of another mainland partner.
HKT is making positive noises, but says no formal approaches had been made. "It's
up to the Chinese government if one of its agencies wants to take a stake in our
company," says HKT chairman Brian Smith.

<P> Of course a mainland tie-up could also open the way for lucrative work there.
Andersen Consulting managing partner Larry Levitan says that the standard of
services in China is so low that phenomenal growth is inevitable: there could be
more telephone lines in Asia by the turn of the century than in the US. For HKT
the question is twofold: will the firm get a share of the vast neighbouring
market and, if it does, who will take the profits?
