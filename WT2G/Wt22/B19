<title>Drug Czar Opposes Minimums</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->

<body>

<h1>Drug Czar Criticized Mandatory Minimums</h1>

<p>In a May 21, 1995 interview with the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Dallas.html">Dallas</a>
<cite>Morning News</cite>,
Lee Brown, the director of the White House Office of National Drug Control
Policy, and former police chief of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Houston.html">Houston</a>,
criticized manadatory minimum sentencing for drug offenses.</p>

<p>Brown said, "I have two concerns with mandatory minimums at a federal
level: one is that low-level drug dealers are now in our federal prisons
taking up space that should be there for violent offenders -- people who are
a threat to our society."</p>

<p>Exactly! Here, the "drug czar" tacitly admits that drug dealing is a
nonviolent crime, and that violent offenders should be given law
enforcement priority.</p>

<p>Brown continued, "Number two is that minorities, particularly
African-Americans, are more likely to use crack cocaine. Whites are
more likely to use powder cocaine. If you're caught with 5 grams of
crack cocaine, you go to prison. If you're caught with 5 grams of powder
cocaine, you get probation. Thus we have an increasingly large number of
African-Americans in our prison system. That's a disparity. ... I believe that
it's wrong to have that disparity. ... If we're concerned about violence,
let's look at violence as a separate issue and not the type of drug you're
using."</p>

<p>Again, good analysis, Lee. The drug war has been based in racism since
its origins.</p>

<title>Effects of Marijuana</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Effects of Marijuana</h1>

<p>Marijuana can halt the progress of glaucoma and combat nausea
caused by chemotherapy or prescription drugs. Numerous medical
experts have endorsed its use, including the prestigious
<a href="/revolution/body/drugs/critics/jom.html">New England
Journal of Medicine</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to medical use, the hemp plant (marijuana) has many industrial
uses. Hemp is a more quickly renewable source of pulp for paper, and its
fibers have been used for centuries in rope, canvas and other uses. Prohibition,
in a vain attempt at eliminating recreational use, succeeds in eliminating
all these beneficial uses.</p>

<P>Hemp has a rich history. <a href="bales.html">Hemp bales</a> have even
been used as a military defense.</p>

<title>Bolivian President Supports Legalization</title>
<!-- Place: Bolivia -->
<!-- Time: November 1994 -->
</head>
<body>

<h1>Bolivian President Supports Legalization</h1>

<p>November 7, 1994, from the Voice of America:</p>

<p>INTRO: <a href="/revolution/by_place/SouthAmerica/Bolivia/">Bolivian</a>
President <a
href="/revolution/by_name/S/GonzaloSanchez.html">Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada</a>
has warned that international drug traffickers are seeking to -- in his words --
Colombianize his country. He says they are moving to Bolivia, which
after Colombia, is already the world's biggest producer of cocaine.
VOA <a href="/revolution/by_place/SouthAmerica/">South America</a>
correspondent Roger Wilkison reports Mr. Sanchez de
Lozada warned his fellow citizens that Bolivia cannot afford to
underestimate the danger of drugs and drug trafficking.</p>

<p>TEXT: In an interview on Bolivian television Sunday night, the
64-year-old President said there is nothing in the world that
is as dangerous as the Colombian mafia. He accused Colombian
drug traffickers of trying to mount what he called a narco-invasion of
Bolivia.</p>

<p>Mr. Sanchez de Lozada's warning followed an attempt last week by
what Bolivian police said were elements of the Cali (Colombia) cocaine
cartel -- the most powerful drug trafficking organization in the
western hemisphere -- to free Colombian prisoners in a maximum security
jail outside La Paz. The planned raid on the prison was frustrated by
Bolivia's anti-drug police supported by U.S. drug enforcement agents.
Fourteen people, including six Colombians, were arrested. Large quantities
of arms, explosives and ammunition were confiscated.</p>

<p>The President also acknowledged that most of Bolivia's production of
coca is used to make cocaine. Thirty thousand Bolivian families are
involved in growing coca, the raw material for cocaine, in a central
Bolivian region known as the Chapare, which has been the scene of
frequent trouble between police and farmers.</p>

<p>Mr. Sanchez de Lozada said the farmers make cocaine paste and are
therefore part of the drug trafficking cycel. That remark is not
going to be welcomed by the farmers, who, last month, staged a
march on La Paz to protest police raids on their crops. The
farmers say that growing coca is the only way they can eke out a
living. Although most Bolivians say they are against drug trafficking,
they support the farmers.</p>

<p>Mr. Sanchez de Lozada said he personally believes that drugs should
be legalized because prohibition of substances for which there is high
demand has never worked. But he said that, as President of Bolivia, he
cannot afford to defend that position because the decision on whether to
legalize drugs must be made in consuming countries.</p>

<title>ABA President Supports Decrim</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: June 28, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>ABA President Favors Decriminalization of Drugs</h1>

<p>From the Fall 1994 <cite>Drug Policy Letter</cite>, p. 26:</p>

<p>Last year, the <a href="/revolution/by_name/A/ABA.html">American Bar
Association</a> elected <a
href="/revolution/by_name/B/GeorgeBushnell.html">George
Bushnell, Jr.</a> to be its new president. Bushnell touched off a
publicity bombshell.</p>

<p>"I personally favor decriminalization of all drugs," Bushnell
told <cite>USA Today</cite> on June 28.  One reason, Bushnell added, is that
"it takes the profit out of it, which in turn reduces the
attractiveness of the drug activity among kids."</p>

<p>Bushnell said he was expressing his own opinion, since the ABA
currently takes no position on drug policy reform.</p>

<p>Bushnell, who is 70, grew up during alcohol prohibition, which
helped to make up his mind on the subject. In a <cite>Rolling Stone</cite>
question-and-answer session, Bushnell recalled that Prohibition
fueled black market-related crime. "Once alcohol was again
legalized, that kind of crime went out the window," he said.</p>

<p>Did his public remarks stir up any controversy for him? No one
wrote the ABA to protest, which meant two things to Bushnell: "One
is that the question of the decriminalization of drugs is not as
controversial as conventional wisdom would deem it to be," Bushnell
said. "Second, that decriminalization is recognized as an issue
that really ought to be debated."</p>

<p>To contact the ABA write to 750 North Lake Shore Drive,
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>,

<title>Frisco Supports Medical Marijuana</title>
<!-- Place: Frisco, Colorado (USA) -->

<body>

<h1>Frisco, Colorado Supports Medical Marijuana</h1>

<p>From a posting by <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NORML.html">NORML</a>:</p>

<p>On July 5, after hearing 2 hours of testimony from a sympathetic and
supportive crowd, the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/co/Frisco.html">Frisco</a>
Town Council unanimously passed a resolution urging the state of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/co/">Colorado</a> to
"reactivate the research program on the use
and dispensing of marijuana for medical purposes."</p>

<p>The resolution goes on to say, "Whereas, upon the legislative report of
findings establishing the effective use of marijuana as a therapeutic drug,
the Town of Frisco strongly encourages the State of Colorado and the federal
government to legalize the dispensing of marijuana for medical purposes
pursuant to federal and state guidelines."</p>

<p>Frisco is the second town in Colorado to publicly address the ban on medical
access to marijuana.  In April, residents of
<a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/co/Breckenridge.html">Breckenridge</a>
voted 261-213 in
favor of an ordinance ordering the police chief and district attorney to make
the arrest and prosecution of those using or cultivating marijuana for medical
purposes their lowest priority.</p>

<h1>Alameda County Supports Medical Marijuana</h1>

<p>From a posting by <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NORML.html">NORML</a>:</p>

<p>On July 12, 1994, the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Alameda.html">Alameda
County</a> Board of Supervisors passed a resolution urging the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> state
legislature to pass -- and the Governor to sign --
Senate Bill 1364 which would reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a
Schedule II substance, thereby making it available for use by prescription.</p>

<p>Alameda County joins almost a dozen other locales in California as going on
record as favoring legal medical access to marijuana.</p>

<title>Medical Journal Supports Medical Marijuana</title>
<!-- Place: -->
<!-- Time: -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Medical Journal Endorses Marijuana as Medicine</h1>

<p>In January 1997, the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine
endorsed the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Dr. Jerome Kassirer,
the journal's editor, said marijuana can be useful in treating
glaucoma, chemotherapy-induced nausea, and AIDS wasting diseases, and
is actually safer than some legal drugs currently used to treat the
same conditions.</p>

<p>The journal called the U.S. federal government restrictions on
medical marijuana "misguided, heavy-handed and inhumane."</p>

<p>In a response, U.S. "drug idiot" Barry McCaffery said,
"Smoke is not a medicine. Other treatments have been deemed safer
and more effective than a psychoactive burning carcinogen self-induced
through one's throat."</p>

<p>McCaffery's reaction reflects the moral absolutist mindset of
prohibitionists. Smoking is a highly effective mechanism for getting
drugs into the bloodstream, safer than alternatives such as injection,
and more effective than pills in cases of nausea. Instead of looking
at it from a scientific perspective, prohibitionists classify everything
in the world as "good" or "bad" with no concern for individual
circumstances.</p>

<title>New Marijuana Study</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Marijuana Linked to Getting High</h1>

<p>(original author unknown)</p>

<P>The National Institute of Health released the results of a controversial
new study today, one that links the drug marijuana to sitting around and
getting high. The study, a comprehensive five-year survey of drug use among
Americans, also suggests a possible connection between marijuana and getting
baked off your ass.</p>

<p>"We have found that where there's marijuana," explained Institute
spokesperson Roger Krell, "there's also a good chance of finding stoners on 
a couch passing around a bong." Krell added that in such situations, "There is
also a strong likelihood of finding incense, a TV, and some chips, usually
Ruffles."</p>

<p>Krell would neither confirm nor deny the alleged link between marijuana
and Pink Floyd's <cite>The Wall</cite>. He would confirm, however, that the
album rules. "There is some seriously fucked-up shit on that album," he
said. "Especially side two. Mother do you think they'll drop the bomb..."</p>

<p>Marijuana, or "pot," as it is called on the street, is a harmless drug
that helps you relax and feel mellow. Its only known side-effects are
occasional uncontrollable laughter and mild hunger, or "the munchies."</p>

<p>Not everyone agrees with the survey's findings. "Getting high is the
least of marijuana's uses," said Matt Henner, President of Hemp For Victory
and a total pothead. "The ancient Egyptians used hemp to build the pyramids.
In the 1930s, the WPA used it to construct bridges and dams. Today it is 
used for medicine and as a non-polluting alternative to gasoline." Henner then
admitted he was "wasted beyond belief."</p>

<p>According to experts, drug use among 15-24 year olds is cool. "That's
really the cool age to do drugs," said U.S. Drug Czar Bertrand Seaver. "When
you're young, that's the thing to do. In fact, studies show that teenagers
who smoke pot are far more likely to be accepted by the in-crowd."</p>

<p>While drug use among young people is cool, experts say older people who
still do drugs are losers. "A young person who does drugs is healthy and
normal," said Harvard sociologist Beth Henterpen. "But if a guy's like 45,
and he's still getting high, it's like, 'Get a life!'"</p>

<p>Marijuana also has been proven to have the wonderful side-effect of
enhanced sexual sensations, enabling some users to achieve transcendental
states of erotic bliss. The study found that this link, however, was 
severely limited in many subjects because they had, due to sitting around
all the time, never actually met members of the opposite sex. "But if
they did," said Krell, "then it'd be amazing."</p>

<p>So far, the study has met with formal protest by only two groups. The
Alabama-based Center for the Christian Family, claimed the findings to be
terribly inaccurate, noting marijuana's ability to "make users think they 
can fly and jump out of buildings, like on Quincy, as well as its tendency to
induce demon possession, homicidal rampages, and homosexuality."</p>

<p>Another group to object to the study was California rapping group
Cypress Hill. "Marijuana's not linked to sitting around, man... It's linked
to cruising the Barrio with a 40 and a 12 gauge, blowing pendejos away," 
said group member DJ Muggs. "Hand onna pump, puffin' on a blunt... la la la la
laaaaaaaaaaa..."</p>

<title>The Newer Testament</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Newer Testament</h1>

<h2>The Book of Cool Dude</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>In the beginning, there were no drugs. But then the god Coral, god of the
prophet Cool Dude, god of the messenger Hefe (follower of the teachings of
El Guapo), said "Wow!" and there were drugs.</p>

<p>And He saw that they were cool.</p>

<p>Then he created man and woman, to share pleasant experiences with. But the
archfiend Dr. Baddvibe, fiend of puking, dark lord of addiction, demon of
overdose, gave Bud Light to the first humans, and thus all people are born
with original uncoolness.</p>

<p>Many generations passed before the messenger Hefe (follower of the teachings
of El Guapo) was conceived and born. The messenger Hefe grew up in the town
of El Nacho, and learned the teachings of El Guapo, and became Hefe, follower
of the teachings of El Guapo.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>And so it came to be that the messenger Hefe (follower of the teachings of
El Guapo), came into the possession of a wicked leather jacket, which attracted
the finest babes in El Nacho.</p>

<p>And the dudes of El Nacho became jealous of the wicked leather jacket
belonging to the messenger Hefe (follower of the teachings of El Guapo).
These uncool dudes plotted to sell bad acid to Hefe (follower of the teachings
of El Guapo).</p>

<p>But Hefe (follower of the teachings of El Guapo) was warned in a pipe dream
by the god Coral, god of the prophet Cool Dude, and left El Nacho on a
pilgrimage to <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/">Oklahoma</a>, which was
OK with the god of the prophet Cool Dude.</p>

<p>Meanwhile El Nacho was shut down by a police raid sent by the wrath of Coral
against the dudes of El Nacho, where Hefe (follower of the teachings of El
Guapo) was born.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>Right about now you're probably wondering, "Who the hell is El Guapo?"</p>

<p>Fret no longer, for here is the story of El Guapo, teacher of the messenger
Hefe.</p>

<p>El Guapo grew up in a foreign land, a land where marijuana grew by the side
of the road, and where people complained because they had to pull the weed out
of their flower gardens.</p>

<p>One day El Guapo was sitting on a hill, after the woman who would soon bear
his first child (the first of a hundred) had left.</p>

<p>The hemp plant grew in profusion on this hill, and the god Coral, god of
the prophet Cool Dude, spoke to El Guapo through a burning bush. At least,
El Guapo thought he heard god speaking to him after he got close to that
burning plant.</p>

<p>Every day and every night for forty days and forty nights El Guapo returned
to that hill, where he had strange visions, and angels talked to him, and
told him strange tales.</p>

<p>He learned many things on that hill from the spirits that talked to him.
He learned how to tell the female plant from the male plant, how to roll the
plant in slips of paper for smoking, how to cook the plant in bread, and many
wonders even more miraculous than these.</p>

<p>When El Guapo was almost eighteen, he received a mission from God. "I am
a drifter," said El Guapo, "and I must wander the world, spreading the
knowledge I have learned."</p>

<p>So El Guapo left the land of his birth, which drafted its eighteen-year-olds
into its army. El Guapo headed north, and stayed for a while in the town of
El Nacho, birthplace of the messenger Hefe. El Guapo taught Hefe all that he
knew about the sacred plant Cannabis, and left El Nacho, because he was a
drifter. And he was flat broke.</p>

<h1>Maryland Cops Search Black Because of Skin Color</h1>

<p>In May 1992, a <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/md/">Maryland</a> state trooper
pulled over Robert Wilkins,
who was returning home with his family from his grandfather's funeral.
The trooper used speeding as an excuse for stopping Wilkins, but actually
had targeted him for a drug search based on a race-based "profile."</p>

<p>The trooper pressured Wilkins to submit to a search. When Wilkins refused,
citing his Constitutional rights against unreasonable search, the trooper
called in a Sheriff's deputy with a drug-sniffing dog. The police made the
Wilkins family stand in the rain as the dog searched the car for drugs,
finding none.</p>

<p>Wilkins, along with civil liberties organizations, filed suit in federal
court in February 1993, challenging the racist profiles as
unconstitutional. On January 4, 1995, the Maryland State Police settled the
case, agreeing to sweeping changes in their policies and awarding over
$95,000 to the plaintiffs.</p>

<title>DEA-Lockerbie Link</title>
<!-- Place: Lockerbie, Scotland (UK) -->
<!-- Time: late 1988 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>DEA May Be Involved In Lockerbie Disaster</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/H/MalcolmHutty.html">Malcolm
Hutty</a>:</p>

<p>I am currently listening to a BBC Radio 4 interview with an ex-DEA
official named Lester Coleman. He claims that the Pan-Am airliner which
was blown up over <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/Lockerbie.html">Lockerbie</a>, Scotland,
killing 200+ was not bombed by
Libyan terrorists but probably by Lebanese drug smugglers and terrorists
approved by the DEA.</p>

<p>He used to run a DEA/CIA joint operation in Frankfurt. The operation was
to approve the smuggling of drugs on American planes into America.  These
drugs could then be traced, allowing the DEA to find and capture American
importers, distributors and dealers. His office co-ordinated the
smuggling through third-party countries that the plane would land in en
route to the States, assuring the Drug Enforcement officials of those
countries that the drugs were being transferred through and would not end
up in their country. </p>

<p>18 months before the bombing, the ground operative of the DEA in Syria and
a friend of his were shot. He suspected that the Lebanese terrorists and
smugglers working in Syria found out that they were being used by the DEA.
He reported back to his supervisors in the States, who told him to pack up
and get out. He returned to America, where he was debriefed and
transferred to other duties. Since then he has been fired, and after a
court action (sorry, I didn't catch what for) he has been charged with
perjury. Since then he has discovered that his operation in Frankfurt was
restarted after his recall home. </p>

<p> He claims that in his experience the Libyan government would not have the
intelligence capability to plant a bomb on the Pan Am airliner. His
experience was as working as a DIA operative in Tripoli. </p>

<p> On the other hand the Lebanese working through their allies the Syrians
had the capability and the opportunity. The DEA sees them as drug
smugglers -- that is their worth to the DEA -- but they are primarily
terrorists with a political and religious agenda, using drug smuggling to
finance their operations. </p>

<p> Coleman says that security at Frankfurt and Heathrow airports, where the
doomed airliner stopped, is normally very tight, and it would take an
extremely effective unit to get a bomb through. It is most likely, in his
judgement, that the package that was a bomb was waived through by the DEA
operation that he used to belong to under the mistaken belief that it was
a drug consignment. After all, that must have been the belief of the
courier who took it onto the flight and got blown up with it. </p>

<p> After the interview with him the interviewer said that the Lockerbie 
police unit, the Crown Prosecution Service, the Foreign Office, the Home 
Office (responsible for, <cite>inter alia</cite>, MI5 the home intelligence 
service and liaison with similar services in other friendly nations like 
the DEA), HM Customs and Excise, and the Frankfurt police have produced 
almost identical "No comment" statements, saying that "in the light of the 
pending prosecution of two (Libyan) men for the bombing it would be 
inappropriate to comment or to co-operate with a programme in which 
opinions as to the guilt or innocence of these men might be canvassed"
Under British law such comment is <cite>sub judice</cite>, i.e. illegal. No
First Amendment here.</p>

<p> There was also a telephone interview with an academic, Dr. Squire. He
said nothing except that it was extremely plausible, especially when you
look at the passage in Mrs. Thatcher's recently published memoirs which
say ...  -- at which point the phone went dead. The interviewer said "Dr
Squire? We appear to have lost Dr Squire. In today's European Union summit
the GATT was the centre of attention...". He came back later to say that all
people who had any information relating to the bombing should contact the
Lockerbie police, and having said that the Thatcher memoirs were particularly
interesting on this issue because ... I'm sorry Dr Squire, that is all we've
got time for.</p>

<title>Marijuana Clubs</title>
<!-- Place: USA; Washington, DC (USA); San Francisco, California (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1991 - 1995 -->

<body>

<h1>Cannabis Buyers' Clubs</h1>

<p>In <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/SanFrancisco.html">San
Francisco</a>, there is a place that sells 40 pounds
of marijuana per week to eight thousand people -- over the counter.</p>

<p>Since 1991, more than two dozen "Cannabis Buyers' Clubs" have
sprung up in the U.S. to sell marijuana for medical purposes. The
Buyers' Clubs are modeled after clubs set up by AIDS victims to
purchase experimental drugs from abroad that were not yet approved
in the U.S.</p>

<p>The first Buyers' Club was opened by an HIV-positive man in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington,
D.C.</a>, to supply marijuana to AIDS patients suffering from wasting syndrome.
Marijuana has proven to be medically useful against a variety of ailments,
from glaucoma to lack of appetite. The clubs require picture id and a letter
of recommendation from a physician, and call the physician to verify the
recommendation.</p>

<p>The San Francisco club is the largest, with nearly 8,000 members
and approximately $60,000 in weekly sales.
The directory, Dennis Peron, is trying to get medical marijuana
legalized in California.</p>

<p>Local authorities generally tolerate or actively sanction the clubs,
but the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency is trying to "get tough," making
three club-related arrests in 1995.</p>

<h1>Feds Terrorize Women</h1>

<p>From the <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a>:</p>

<p>Just after dawn on September 5, 1991 some sixty agents from the DEA, U.S.
Forest Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF), and National
Guard, complete with painted faces and camouflage and accompanied by another
twenty or more National Guard troops with a light armored vehicle, raided the
homes of Sina Brush and two of her neighbors near
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nm/Montainair.html">Montainair</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nm/">New Mexico</a>. Brush
and her daughter were still asleep.</p>

<p>Hearing noises outside, Ms. Brush got up and was only halfway across the
room, when the door was kicked in by the agents. Clad only in their underwear,
Ms. Brush and her daughter were handcuffed and forced to kneel in the middle of
the room while the agents searched the house. No drugs were found. The police
had obtained a warrant using information furnished by an unreliable informant
and had entered Brush's home without knocking first.</p>

<h1>Maryland Cops Search Black Because of Skin Color</h1>

<p>In May 1992, a <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/md/">Maryland</a> state trooper
pulled over Robert Wilkins,
who was returning home with his family from his grandfather's funeral.
The trooper used speeding as an excuse for stopping Wilkins, but actually
had targeted him for a drug search based on a race-based "profile."</p>

<p>The trooper pressured Wilkins to submit to a search. When Wilkins refused,
citing his Constitutional rights against unreasonable search, the trooper
called in a Sheriff's deputy with a drug-sniffing dog. The police made the
Wilkins family stand in the rain as the dog searched the car for drugs,
finding none.</p>

<p>Wilkins, along with civil liberties organizations, filed suit in federal
court in February 1993, challenging the racist profiles as
unconstitutional. On January 4, 1995, the Maryland State Police settled the
case, agreeing to sweeping changes in their policies and awarding over
$95,000 to the plaintiffs.</p>

<title>DEA Attacks Again</title>
<!-- Place: Poway, California (USA) -->
<!-- Time: August 25, 1992 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>DEA critically wounds innocent man</h1>

<p>From the <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On August 25, 1992 at about 10:30 p.m., Donald Carlson returned to his home
in <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Poway.html">Poway</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>,
opened his garage door with a remote control device,
simultaneously illuminating the garage so that Drug Enforcement Administration
agents conducting surveillance from nearby could see inside. Just after
midnight, when Carlson was asleep, a group of DEA agents burst into his house.
Thinking they were robbers, Carlson grabbed his pistol to defend himself. He
also dialed 911 for help. The agents shot Carlson three times, twice after he
was down and clearly disabled. Carlson spent seven weeks in intensive care,
fighting for his life. No drugs were found on the premises.</p>

<p>It was later learned that the Federal Customs Service, the DEA and the U.S.
Attorney's Office in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/SanDiego.html">San Diego</a>
had relied on an informant who was known to be
untrustworthy and who claimed Carlson's garage contained 2,500 kilograms of
cocaine (a large amount which would have taken up most of the garage) and four
armed guards. The agents conducted the raid in spite of the fact they could see
the informant's information was erroneous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Libernet, Rich McCormack (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:macknet@cts.com">macknet@cts.com</a>) quoted the
May 29, 1995 San Diego <cite>Union-Tribune</cite> giving details of the
shooting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the raid was launched, the WET [Weapons Entry Tactical unit,
similar to SWAT] team couldn't break through the heavy oak double front
doors. After pounding the doors three or four times with a battering
ram, they smashed a front window and tried to climb through but got
tangled in a Venetian blind.</p>

<p>By the time they got in, Carlson had awakened from a deep sleep and armed
himself, groggily thinking he was being beseiged by a band of robbers. The
first agent inside saw a dark figure with a gun and started shooting. Wounded
in the leg, Carlson threw down his weapon and retreated to his bedroom, where
he curled himself into a fetal position on the floor.</p>

<p>Another agent burst through the door and fired two more shots.
One entered Carlson's back, sending a bullet fragment into his lung.</p>

<p>Hooked to a ventilator in a hospital's intensive-care wing, Carlson
hovered near death for six weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Carlson has settled in a civil judgment with the U.S. Attorney's office for
$2.75 million. Although the informant was found guilty of lying to the
government, and faces more than ten years in prison, none of the government
agents have been punished for their actions.</p>

<h1>Drug Cops Kill Rancher</h1>

<p>On October 2, 1992, a swarm of law enforcement officers descended upon
the 200-acre
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Malibu.html">Malibu</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> ranch of
Donald P. Scott. Scott, 61, confronted the
deputies while armed with a handgun. He was shot and killed by
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/LosAngeles.html">Los
Angeles</a> Sheriff's Deputy Gary Spencer.</p>

<p>According to a report by Ron Sable and Carol Bidwel in the March 30, 1993
San Fernando <cite>Daily News</cite>, agencies involved in the raid included
the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, which led the raid, the Drug Enforcement
Administration, the National Park Service and the U.S. Border Patrol.</p>

<p>The Ventura County District Attorney's Office released a lengthy report
on the raid March 30, 1993. In it, District Attorney Michael Bradbury harshly
criticized the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, but decided not to
prosecute the deputy responsible for the killing. Bradbury forwarded the
report to Ventura and Los Angeles county grand juries for further
investigation.</p>

<p>The entrance to Scott's Trail's End Ranch lies in Los Angeles County, but
the ranch itself is entirely in Ventura County. The Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department did not notify Ventura authorities until after the
raid.</p>

<p>On September 23, 1992, a flyover by the DEA claimed that there were
"approximately 50 (marijuana) plants ... growing around some large trees"
near the ranch house. The flyover was used as the basis for the October 1
search warrant, even though U.S. Border Patrol agents conducting a secret
September 24 search of the property found no marijuana plants.</p>

<p>Nothing illegal was ever found at Scott's ranch.</p>

<title>Chicago Indoor Garden Supply</title>
<!-- Place: Chicago, Illinois, US -->
<!-- Time: March 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Chicago Indoor Garden Supply</h1>

<p>March 1993, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/J/JeffreyJohnson.html">Jeffrey
Adam Johnson</a>:</p>

<p>This story was on WBBM-TV, Channel 2,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago's</a>
CBS station, on this evening's 10 O'Clock News.</p>

<p>Starting a week ago, the Drug Enforcement Administration has been
watching Chicago Indoor Garden Supply of Streamwood, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a>, from a camera
somewhat ineptly camouflaged as an electric transformer on a utility pole
across the street. This store does 70% of its business in homebrewing
suppies, and has become one of the favorite suppliers to Chicago area
homebrewers.</p>

<p>Two homebrewers were interviewed by Channel 2 who had been
followed home from the store by the Federalies, and had their homes
ransacked for drugs.</p>

<p>When Ch.2's news truck parked in front of a nearby
storefront the DEA has been using as a staging location, an "interesting"
scene unfolded with a Ch.2 reporter not getting very many answers from
the Feds, who tried in vain to keep their cover. (Note: Ch.2 did
obscure their faces as per standard practice when showing undercover
agents.) Then a swarm of Streamwood Police Dept. cars came, sirens and
lights going, to try to chase away the Ch.2 news crew.</p>

<p>The whole slant of the story was that this was a case of the DEA going
too far in "Operation Green Merchant", where they are going after stores
in Suburban Chicago which they suspect are supplying marijuana growers
with lights, fertilizer, etc. The presumption is that if they follow
enough homebrewers and other purchasers of perfectly legal merchandize
home from this store, eventually they'll find drugs in somebody's house,
and then they can sieze and close the store. Since they have an officer
assigned full-time to follow customers of this store home, they figure
the odds are in their favor.</p>

<p>Channel 2 Chicago is to be complimented for broadcasting this story, and
for emphasizing several times during it that homebrewing is legal. Watch
for further developments - WBBM-TV generally does a good job of following
up on stories of this sort.</p>

<title>Warrantless Search At Fort Bend School</title>
<!-- Place: Missouri City, Fort Bend County, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Warrantless Search At Fort Bend School</h1>

<p>In April 1993, police made an unannounced, warrantless search of Elkins
High, a
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/MissouriCity.html">Missouri
City</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> high school
housing only ninth- and tenth-grade students.</p>

<p>As reported by William Peck in the April 29, 1993 <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Houston.html">Houston</a>
<cite>Post</cite>,
more than sixty officers "blocked classroom doors to control students coming
and going, and restricted students to one side of the room while drug-sniffing
dogs searched backpacks, lockers and parking lots."</p>

<p>All that was found was spilled beer in one vehicle and a trace of
marijuana in another. No arrests were made. Officials deemed the effort
a success and plan to repeat it at other schools.</p>

<p>This story points out many problems with government intervention. There's
no such thing as a free lunch, and when government offers "free" schools, you
can be sure there will be strings attached. The other problem highlighted here
is that pursuing the drug war to its fullest will require a police state.
Are you ready for such sweeps of your house?</p>

<title>Hydroponics Store Owners Face Life</title>
<!-- Place: Georgia (USA) -->
<!-- Time: January 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Hydroponics Store Owners Face Life</h1>

<p>January 1994, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/T/MikeTanner.html">Mike
Tanner</a>:</p>

<p>Many readers of this net are aware that <a
href="/revolution/by_name/L/NancyLord.html">Nancy Lord</a> has been the
attorney for the owners of a <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a> hydroponics
store on trial for
"conspiracy" to "aide and abet" the growing of marijuanna by "encouraging"
people to grow pot by "providing equipment and advice."</p>

<p>The verdict is now in: the couple were found guilty and now face a potential
sentence of life (yes <em>life</em>!) in prison. Scary isn't it.</p>

<p>For two years the DEA (and National Guard) sat in front of the store and 
recorded the license numbers of everyone who entered the store. They then
subpoenaed the utility bills for everyone visiting the store.  If the bills
were high enough to suggest marijuana cultivation, the people were raided. 
While bursting in on several little old ladies growing orchids and businessmen
with aquariums, they also arrested more than 30 pot growers.</p>

<p>The tale of this investigation is one of nearly unprecedented government 
abuse of power.  Nancy attempted to put the government's actions on trial and
was so vigorous that she was cited for contempt.  Sentencing will be March
31.</p>

<title>SWAT Swats Paraplegic</title>
<!-- Place: Oldsmar, Florida (USA) -->
<!-- Time: March 1995 -->

</head>

<body>

<h1>Yet Another "Wrong House"</h1>

<p>A SWAT team seeking to serve an arrest warrant bashed in a window
and a sliding door entering the wrong address.</p>

<p>As reported in an AP story in the March 19, 1995 Pensacola <cite>News
Journal</cite>, p.6B, the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/Oldsmar.html">Oldsmar</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a>
 SWAT team broke into the
home of 31-year-old Charles Inscor, knocking him from his bed and
detaching him from a machine assisting his breathing, before realizing
they had the wrong house.</p>

<p>The correct house was two buildings down. The "suspected drug dealer"
there was arrested later without incident.</p>

<p>The real outrage of this story is not that the team demolished the wrong
back door, but that police now serve arrest warrants in a manner more
fit to third-world dictatorships. This is an inevitable consequence of
the drug war and its ever-escalating invasion of our rights.</p>

<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/Phoenix.html">Phoenix</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a> resident
Mark Cramer gained custody of his three
children, he used his savings to repair his 1985 pickup truck and move
into a larger apartment.</p>

<p>When thieves stole his pickup in April 1995, he had trouble finding
transportation to get to his job on time.</p>

<p>When Customs agents recovered his pickup a month later, Cramer thought he
was lucky. Customs seized the truck in a border drug bust. The smugglers who
stole the pickup pled guilty four days after their arrest, leaving Customs
with no reason to keep the truck.</p>

<p>But the feds didn't give it back, despite repeated requests by Cramer,
a Phoenix police officer, and a Phoenix lawyer working pro bono.</p>

<p>"This happens all the time," a Customs official told him. Cramer lost his
job because he couldn't get to work. He lost his apartment because he could
no longer pay the rent. He and his family now live on the streets.</p>

<title>Police Let Jailee Inhale</title>
<!-- Place: arrested Ohio (USA);

<!-- Time: July 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Prescription for Pot</h1>

<p>25-year-old Todd McCormick has a prescription for marijuana, but that
didn't stop <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/">Ohio</a> state troopers
from arresting him in July 1995 when they
found some in his car after a traffic stop. However, the judge would've let
him smoke it in jail.</p>

<p>McCormick has a prescription from a doctor in the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/Netherlands/">Netherlands</a> to use
marijuana for chronic pain resulting from ten childhood bouts with cancer.
He is trying to start a group in his hometown of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ri/Providence.html">Providence</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ri/">Rhode Island</a>,
that would give marijuana to the seriously ill. McCormick's effort is
reminiscent of activists who smuggled in FDA-unapproved drugs to combat
AIDS. The AIDS drug buyers' clubs eventually caused the FDA to loosen its
restrictions.</p>

<p>Unable to raise his $150,000 bail, McCormick argued before a judge that
he required marijuana for medical purposes. Since the age of 2, McCormick
has undergone extensive treatment for cancer of the spine, skull, right ear
and left hip, as well as a tumor between his heart and lung. He first began
smoking marijuana at age ten to combat nausea and dizziness associated with
radiation therapy.</p>

<p>Judge Anthony Gretick ruled that McCormick could smoke marijuana in jail
if a local doctor agreed with the medical necessity. The issue will not be
tested, however, because McCormick was able to make bail when it was
lowered to $20,000.</p>

<p>"There are alternative therapies as good if not better than smoking
marijuana for all of the medical conditions for which there have been
requests for medicinal marijuana, including chronic pain," said Rayford
Kytle, a spokesman for the Public Health Service, which in the U.S.
controls all legal access to marijuana for medical purposes. The question is,
why does Kytle get to make that decision for someone else?</p>

<p>If convicted, McCormick faces up to thirty years in prison.</p>

<title>Another Record Bust</title>
<!-- Time: August 1995 -->
<!-- Place: Pacific Ocean near Peru -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Another Record Cocaine Bust</h1>

<p>In August 1995, U.S. officials seized twelve tons of cocaine from a
Panamanian freighter, charging ten Colombian crewmen with possession
with intent to distribute. The seizure was a yet another new record amount
of cocaine siezed on the high seas.</p>

<p>Apparently believing the United States is suffering a shortage of
domestic criminals, the U.S. Navy decided to import some from South
America. A Navy cruiser, encountering the <i>Nataly I</i> nearly eight
hundred miles west of Peru, called the U.S. Coast Guard, which found
evidence of cocaine during a "consensual" boarding.</p>

<p>How many more record busts have to occur to show prohibitionists that the
drug supply can't be stopped?</p>

<title>China Gets Tough</title>
<!-- Place: Guangdong, China -->
<!-- Time: March - September 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Can you get any tougher?</h1>

<p>All we need to win the war on drugs, I am told, is to "get tough."
I'm not sure what "tough" is, but if execution ain't it I don't know
what qualifies.</p>

<p>The September 1, 1995 San Francisco <cite>Examiner</cite> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Authorities in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/China/">China's</a> booming southern
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/China/Guangdong.html">Guangdong</a> province
have executed
14 people for drug trafficking and robbery in the provincial capital,
Guangzhou, the Yangcheng Evening News said.</p>

<p>The executions Thursday were the latest in a province-wide crackdown that
officials say has netted 6,000 people for drugs offenses since March.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now if getting tough works so well, why is one Chinese province still
arresting nearly 1,000 people per month on drug charges? This recalls China's
penalty against opium smuggling in the 1800's: beheading for the smuggler and
enslavement for his family.</p>

<p>Also notice the reference to the province's "booming" economy. If drugs
are such a drag on the economy as prohibitionists claim, then why is a province
with such a drug problem doing so much better than the rest of China?</p>

<h1>U.S. Sentencing Commission recommends lowering crack penalities</h1>

<p>The U.S. Sentencing Commission, which makes sentencing guidelines for
federal offenses and recommends changes to Congress, recommended that
penalties for crack cocaine offenses be lowered to the same level as for
offenses involving powder cocaine.</p>

<p>The commission noted that although the two drugs are identical in
effects, penalties for crack cocaine possession and dealing are many times
higher than for similar powder cocaine offenses. Powder cocaine is used
more often by whites, while crack cocaine is more often used by blacks,
leading to huge racial disparities in sentencing for similar offenses.</p>

<p>The U.S. Congress rejected the recommendation in October 1995.</p>

<p>The crack/powder cocaine discrepancy is yet more proof of the racial
motivation behind drug prohibition.</p>

<h2>Prison Riots</h2>

<p>On October 19, 1995, prisoners in three federal prisons rioted
after the U.S. Congress rejected the sentencing commission recommendation
to lower crack cocaine penalties.</p>

<p>Thirteen people were injured in the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/al/Talladega.html">Talladega</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/al/">Alabama</a> riot, which
caused $1 million in damage from fires and vandalism.

<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/Allenwood.html">Allenwood</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania</a>

<p>On October 20, the U.S. Department of Justice declared a lockdown
at federal prisons nationwide.

<h1>U.S. Senator Proposes Tobacco Ad Restriction</h1>

<p>In March 1993, U.S. Senator Tom Harkin (D-<a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ia/">Iowa</a>) proposed legislation
to eliminate the deduction of advertising as a business expense for
tobacco companies.</p>

<p>In true prohibitionist fashion, Harkin seeks to penalize the makers
of tobacco products for daring to hold a belief contrary to his own.</p>

<p>The <a href="/revolution/by_name/A/ACLU.html">ACLU</a> condemned the
proposal, citing Supreme Court decisions forbidding Congress from
discriminating in policy on the basis of speech content.</p>

<title>Tobacco Ads in Canada</title>
<!-- Place: Canada -->
<!-- Time: September 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Canadian Court Ends Ad Restrictions</h1>

<p>In September 1995, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canada's</a> Supreme Court
struck down Canadian regulations
limiting the advertising and promotion of tobacco products, on free speech
grounds. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the Tobacco
Products Control Act of 1988 is "not justifiable under the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms."</p>

<p>Federal Canadian regulations had banned tobacco ads in newspapers and
magazines, required warning labels on cigarette packs and restricted
tobacco company sponsorship of events.</p>

<p>In a fit of pique, a cancer society spokesman said, "I don't see how the
freedom of expression of a tobacco company can be compared to a painter's
work of art." Obviously the health nazis believe freedom of speech only applies
to viewpoints they agree with.</p>

<title>Battle of the Hemp Bales</title>
<!-- Place: Lexington, Missouri (USA) -->
<!-- Time: battle September 1861; bale sale September 20, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Battle of the Hemp Bales</h1>

<p>In September 1995, the State of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mo/">Missouri</a>
purchased 800 pounds of
marijuana from the <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NORML.html">National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML)</a>.</p>

<p>NORML provided four 200-pound bales of hemp to be part of an
exhibit at the Vistors' Center of the Battle of Lexington State Historic
Site.</p>

<p>The Battle of Lexington, also known as the Battle of the Hemp Bales,
occurred in September 1861 during the U.S. Civil War, in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mo/Lexington.html">Lexington</a>,
Missouri.
20,000 Missouri volunteers sieged 3,000 federal soldiers who had created
a makeshift earthwork fort. The three-day siege was at a standoff until
the Missourians thought to use recently harvested hemp bales, soaked with
water, as moving defenses.</p>

<p>The Missourians would fire over the bales, then roll them forward,
eventually reaching the fort and defeating the federal troops.</p>

<title>Tobacco, The Feds and You</title>
<!-- Place: -->
<!-- Time: -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Tobacco, The Feds and You</h1>

<p>Smoking is bad for you. We all know that. Few things are as ingrained
in our collective mind as the idea that smoking is a deadly addiction
which ought to be discouraged and punished with extra taxes, age
restrictions, public bans and other such regulations. Life neatly divides
into good guys and bad guys, the good guys being the Surgeon General and his
government cohorts, and the bad guys being those nasty tobacco companies
who sneak up behind people and shove lit cigarettes into their mouths.</p>

<p>Is the real world ever so clearcut? Smoking is a personal habit with
some health risks and some pleasurable benefits. The last thing we need is
more government involvement in our personal choices.</p>

<hr>

<p>"If I cannot smoke cigars in Heaven, I shall not go." So said
Mark Twain, acknowledging that smoking just might be bad for you.</p>

<p>Numerous medical studies over the past century have conclusively shown
the link between tobacco smoking and various diseases, particularly lung
cancer.  Overall, a cigarette smoker has about ten times the risk of
lung cancer as a nonsmoker. Cigar and pipe smokers have only three times
the risk.  And moderate cigar and pipe smokers -- those who smoke no more
than two cigars or pipe bowls per day -- have no significant difference in
risk from nonsmokers.</p>

<p>Smoking a premium cigar is less hazardous than smoking cigarettes for several
reasons. Premium cigars are made with no additives, unlike cigarettes
with hundreds, and cigars' fermentation process results in lower tar
and nicotine. Most cigar and pipe smokers don't inhale the smoke deeply,
while cigarette smokers typically do. Cigar smokers often start smoking
later in life.</p>

<p>Does this mean that cigar and pipe smoking is harmless? Of course not. Heavy
smoking of tobacco in any form raises your risk of several diseases
tremendously. Alcohol and even caffeine use compound the risk. But
smoking is not an inevitable killer, and the stress from worrying
about moderate smoking is more dangerous than the smoking itself.</p>

<hr>

<p>"E = mc2", Albert Einstein said, but he also said, "Pipe smoking contributes
to a somewhat calm and objective judgment in all human affairs." Old
Albert was referring to something the surgeon general shudders to
think of -- the benefits of smoking.</p>

<p>Contrary to government warning labels, smoking is not all danger
and no benefit. Smokers report various pleasurable
aspects of smoking -- mental alertness, general ease, reduced stress.</p>

<p>Very little in life is pure cost or pure benefit. Virtually every
choice we make is a trade-off between what we gain and what we give up.
Who other than yourself is qualified to decide for you whether the benefits
outweigh the costs?</p>

<hr>

<p>Al Haig used to say when he smoked a Cuban cigar, "I'm not violating
the embargo, I'm destroying communist resources."</p>

<p>The American spirit can be summed up as "Don't Tread on Me."
Today, various busybodies are treading on us in countless ways. Our
liberties have suffered the death of a thousand cuts -- we lose a little
bit here, a little bit there. Health Puritans have played their role
in this, with regulations, limitations, strangulations, trying desperately
to condemn us to a long life of no fun.</p>

<p>We have sin taxes on tobacco products. We have an embargo against Cuba
including its world-renowned cigars. We have age restrictions, advertising
bans and countless other pages of federal, state and local regulations
of tobacco use.</p>

<p>It's time for all of us to say to the government, "Butt out!" We support
free trade -- end the pointless embargo against Cuba. We don't want
the likes of Bill Clinton or Bob Dole determining our values --
families and communities can do a much better job of dealing with
teenage smoking. Our right to free speech is absolute and intertwined
with everyone else's -- repeal restrictions against advertising.</p>

<p>Smoking is now more than just a habit. It is an act of rebellion against
the trend towards nanny-government. When you sit out on the porch, savor
the smoke of a fine cigar, and discuss life with some friends,
you're saying to the world, America's still a free country.
Give me your advice, but keep your hands to yourself. I will choose
whether my house and my business are smoke-free or smoke-friendly.</p>

<hr>

<p>Smoking is smelly and unhealthy. We should be considerate of others in
all that we do, keeping in mind our company and our surroundings. At the
same time, moderate smoking is not harmful, can be quite pleasant,
and is a great way to annoy busybodies. We don't have to sig heil
to the health nazis. Government makes a terrible nanny. Whatever your
choice may be regarding smoking, let's make sure it remains just
that -- your choice.</p>

<title>Benefits of Nicotine</title>
<!-- Place: -->
<!-- Time: -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Benefits of Nicotine</h1>

<p>Tobacco has been thoroughly demonized by the health nazis who
supply the press and policy makers with doped information. Prohibitionists
have a unique color blindness to shades of gray -- every drug is
either absolutely "good" or "bad." Nicotine, of course, is bad.</p>

<p>In tobacco's case, prohibitionists and restrictionists have latched
onto scientific evidence that tobacco is addictive and cancer-causing.
They seize anything that might disparage the drug, and ignore anything
that suggests that some use may be harmless or even beneficial.</p>

<p>For years, scientists have been doing research that has found that
cigarette smokers have a <em>reduced</em> risk of certain diseases.
Nicotine may one day be studied to help find treatments for major
health problems like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, attention
deficit disorders, ulcerative colitis and Tourette's syndrome.</p>

<p>Nicotine attaches to certain receptors found on many types of cells,
and stimulates cell activity including the release of neurotransmitters,
including dopamine, acetylcholine and glutamate. This stimulation
reduces the risk of certain neurological diseases such as Parkinson's
by half. Research continues to find beneficial effects of nicotine,
such as interfering with plaque deposits that lead to Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<h2>The Legacy of Prohibitionism</h2>

<p>The prohibitionist mindset, which marks drugs as "good" or "bad,"
blinds people to the reality that all drugs have beneficial and
harmful uses. Dosage, frequency, genetics and numerous other factors
affect what effects a drug will have on a given individual.</p>

<p>The New York Times remarked that nicotine research "sounds a little
like scientific blasphemy" and that "efforts to stop smoking have
discouraged research into the possible benefits of nicotine."</p>

<hr>

<p>Source: January 14, 1997 New York Times News Service article "Can it be?
Researchers investigating possible benefits of nicotine," reprinted
in the <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NandO.html">NandO Times</a>.</p>

<title>Battle of the Hemp Bales</title>
<!-- Place: Lexington, Missouri (USA) -->
<!-- Time: battle September 1861; bale sale September 20, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Battle of the Hemp Bales</h1>

<p>In September 1995, the State of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mo/">Missouri</a>
purchased 800 pounds of
marijuana from the <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NORML.html">National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML)</a>.</p>

<p>NORML provided four 200-pound bales of hemp to be part of an
exhibit at the Vistors' Center of the Battle of Lexington State Historic
Site.</p>

<p>The Battle of Lexington, also known as the Battle of the Hemp Bales,
occurred in September 1861 during the U.S. Civil War, in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mo/Lexington.html">Lexington</a>,
Missouri.
20,000 Missouri volunteers sieged 3,000 federal soldiers who had created
a makeshift earthwork fort. The three-day siege was at a standoff until
the Missourians thought to use recently harvested hemp bales, soaked with
water, as moving defenses.</p>

<p>The Missourians would fire over the bales, then roll them forward,
eventually reaching the fort and defeating the federal troops.</p>

<title>DEA-Lockerbie Link</title>
<!-- Place: Lockerbie, Scotland (UK) -->
<!-- Time: late 1988 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>DEA May Be Involved In Lockerbie Disaster</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/H/MalcolmHutty.html">Malcolm
Hutty</a>:</p>

<p>I am currently listening to a BBC Radio 4 interview with an ex-DEA
official named Lester Coleman. He claims that the Pan-Am airliner which
was blown up over <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/Lockerbie.html">Lockerbie</a>, Scotland,
killing 200+ was not bombed by
Libyan terrorists but probably by Lebanese drug smugglers and terrorists
approved by the DEA.</p>

<p>He used to run a DEA/CIA joint operation in Frankfurt. The operation was
to approve the smuggling of drugs on American planes into America.  These
drugs could then be traced, allowing the DEA to find and capture American
importers, distributors and dealers. His office co-ordinated the
smuggling through third-party countries that the plane would land in en
route to the States, assuring the Drug Enforcement officials of those
countries that the drugs were being transferred through and would not end
up in their country. </p>

<p>18 months before the bombing, the ground operative of the DEA in Syria and
a friend of his were shot. He suspected that the Lebanese terrorists and
smugglers working in Syria found out that they were being used by the DEA.
He reported back to his supervisors in the States, who told him to pack up
and get out. He returned to America, where he was debriefed and
transferred to other duties. Since then he has been fired, and after a
court action (sorry, I didn't catch what for) he has been charged with
perjury. Since then he has discovered that his operation in Frankfurt was
restarted after his recall home. </p>

<p> He claims that in his experience the Libyan government would not have the
intelligence capability to plant a bomb on the Pan Am airliner. His
experience was as working as a DIA operative in Tripoli. </p>

<p> On the other hand the Lebanese working through their allies the Syrians
had the capability and the opportunity. The DEA sees them as drug
smugglers -- that is their worth to the DEA -- but they are primarily
terrorists with a political and religious agenda, using drug smuggling to
finance their operations. </p>

<p> Coleman says that security at Frankfurt and Heathrow airports, where the
doomed airliner stopped, is normally very tight, and it would take an
extremely effective unit to get a bomb through. It is most likely, in his
judgement, that the package that was a bomb was waived through by the DEA
operation that he used to belong to under the mistaken belief that it was
a drug consignment. After all, that must have been the belief of the
courier who took it onto the flight and got blown up with it. </p>

<p> After the interview with him the interviewer said that the Lockerbie 
police unit, the Crown Prosecution Service, the Foreign Office, the Home 
Office (responsible for, <cite>inter alia</cite>, MI5 the home intelligence 
service and liaison with similar services in other friendly nations like 
the DEA), HM Customs and Excise, and the Frankfurt police have produced 
almost identical "No comment" statements, saying that "in the light of the 
pending prosecution of two (Libyan) men for the bombing it would be 
inappropriate to comment or to co-operate with a programme in which 
opinions as to the guilt or innocence of these men might be canvassed"
Under British law such comment is <cite>sub judice</cite>, i.e. illegal. No
First Amendment here.</p>

<p> There was also a telephone interview with an academic, Dr. Squire. He
said nothing except that it was extremely plausible, especially when you
look at the passage in Mrs. Thatcher's recently published memoirs which
say ...  -- at which point the phone went dead. The interviewer said "Dr
Squire? We appear to have lost Dr Squire. In today's European Union summit
the GATT was the centre of attention...". He came back later to say that all
people who had any information relating to the bombing should contact the
Lockerbie police, and having said that the Thatcher memoirs were particularly
interesting on this issue because ... I'm sorry Dr Squire, that is all we've
got time for.</p>

<title>Chicago Indoor Garden Supply</title>
<!-- Place: Chicago, Illinois, US -->
<!-- Time: March 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Chicago Indoor Garden Supply</h1>

<p>March 1993, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/J/JeffreyJohnson.html">Jeffrey
Adam Johnson</a>:</p>

<p>This story was on WBBM-TV, Channel 2,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago's</a>
CBS station, on this evening's 10 O'Clock News.</p>

<p>Starting a week ago, the Drug Enforcement Administration has been
watching Chicago Indoor Garden Supply of Streamwood, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a>, from a camera
somewhat ineptly camouflaged as an electric transformer on a utility pole
across the street. This store does 70% of its business in homebrewing
suppies, and has become one of the favorite suppliers to Chicago area
homebrewers.</p>

<p>Two homebrewers were interviewed by Channel 2 who had been
followed home from the store by the Federalies, and had their homes
ransacked for drugs.</p>

<p>When Ch.2's news truck parked in front of a nearby
storefront the DEA has been using as a staging location, an "interesting"
scene unfolded with a Ch.2 reporter not getting very many answers from
the Feds, who tried in vain to keep their cover. (Note: Ch.2 did
obscure their faces as per standard practice when showing undercover
agents.) Then a swarm of Streamwood Police Dept. cars came, sirens and
lights going, to try to chase away the Ch.2 news crew.</p>

<p>The whole slant of the story was that this was a case of the DEA going
too far in "Operation Green Merchant", where they are going after stores
in Suburban Chicago which they suspect are supplying marijuana growers
with lights, fertilizer, etc. The presumption is that if they follow
enough homebrewers and other purchasers of perfectly legal merchandize
home from this store, eventually they'll find drugs in somebody's house,
and then they can sieze and close the store. Since they have an officer
assigned full-time to follow customers of this store home, they figure
the odds are in their favor.</p>

<p>Channel 2 Chicago is to be complimented for broadcasting this story, and
for emphasizing several times during it that homebrewing is legal. Watch
for further developments - WBBM-TV generally does a good job of following
up on stories of this sort.</p>

<title>Hydroponics Store Owners Face Life</title>
<!-- Place: Georgia (USA) -->

<body>

<h1>Hydroponics Store Owners Face Life</h1>

<p>January 1994, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/T/MikeTanner.html">Mike
Tanner</a>:</p>

<p>Many readers of this net are aware that <a
href="/revolution/by_name/L/NancyLord.html">Nancy Lord</a> has been the
attorney for the owners of a <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a> hydroponics
store on trial for
"conspiracy" to "aide and abet" the growing of marijuanna by "encouraging"
people to grow pot by "providing equipment and advice."</p>

<p>The verdict is now in: the couple were found guilty and now face a potential
sentence of life (yes <em>life</em>!) in prison. Scary isn't it.</p>

<p>For two years the DEA (and National Guard) sat in front of the store and 
recorded the license numbers of everyone who entered the store. They then
subpoenaed the utility bills for everyone visiting the store.  If the bills
were high enough to suggest marijuana cultivation, the people were raided. 
While bursting in on several little old ladies growing orchids and businessmen
with aquariums, they also arrested more than 30 pot growers.</p>

<p>The tale of this investigation is one of nearly unprecedented government 
abuse of power.  Nancy attempted to put the government's actions on trial and
was so vigorous that she was cited for contempt.  Sentencing will be March
31.</p>

<title>1994 Georgia Governor Race</title>
<!-- Place: Georgia (USA) -->
<!-- Time: concessions offered April 1994 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>Republicans Offer Concessions to Libertarians</h1>

<p>From posts April 17 and 19, 1994, by <a
href="/revolution/by_name/T/MikeTanner.html">Mike Tanner</a>:</p>

<p>An extraordinary meeting took place last week between representatives of the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a> Libertarian
Party and the leading Republican candidates for governor.
The Republicans, who either personally attended or sent their campaign
managers, met with <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/NancyLord.html">Dr. Nancy
Lord</a>, <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/CaroleRand.html">Carole Ann Rand</a>,
and the LP's legal counsel.</p>

<p>The Republicans admitted that they were afraid that the presence of an LP
candidate in the governor's race would cost them the election.  They offered a
variety of consessions, including changes in ballot access laws and a signed
pledge to oppose any tax increase, if the LP would not run a candidate for
governor.  However, the Republicans refused to make any concessions on the drug
war or other social issues. As a result, the LP turned down the deal and
<em>will</em> run a candidate for governor.  Obviously the LP-Georgia is
beginning to become a political force.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The Georgia Republican Party has come back with a further list of
concessions in an effort to reach an agreement whereby the Georgia LP will not
run a candidate for governor.  The latest offer includes an agreement that the
Republicans will not run a candidate for Agriculture commissioner (leaving the
LP one-on-one against the Democrat in a statewide race) and a public statement
that ending drug prohibition is a "legitimate topic for public debate."  These
guys must really be scared of us.  Stay tuned for further developments.  [By
the way, I have been advised that LP State Chair Cosmo Boyd, <cite>Georgia
Libertarian</cite> editor Jack Aiken, and LNC Member <a
href="/revolution/by_name/C/RonCrickenberger.html">Ron Crickenberger</a> also
attended the negotiations.]</p>

<title>SWAT Swats Paraplegic</title>
<!-- Place: Oldsmar, Florida (USA) -->
<!-- Time: March 1995 -->

</head>

<body>

<h1>Yet Another "Wrong House"</h1>

<p>A SWAT team seeking to serve an arrest warrant bashed in a window
and a sliding door entering the wrong address.</p>

<p>As reported in an AP story in the March 19, 1995 Pensacola <cite>News
Journal</cite>, p.6B, the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/Oldsmar.html">Oldsmar</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a>
 SWAT team broke into the
home of 31-year-old Charles Inscor, knocking him from his bed and
detaching him from a machine assisting his breathing, before realizing
they had the wrong house.</p>

<p>The correct house was two buildings down. The "suspected drug dealer"
there was arrested later without incident.</p>

<p>The real outrage of this story is not that the team demolished the wrong
back door, but that police now serve arrest warrants in a manner more
fit to third-world dictatorships. This is an inevitable consequence of
the drug war and its ever-escalating invasion of our rights.</p>

<title>Police Let Jailee Inhale</title>
<!-- Place: arrested Ohio (USA);
	destination Providence, Rhode Island (USA);
	prescription The Netherlands -->
<!-- Time: July 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Prescription for Pot</h1>

<p>25-year-old Todd McCormick has a prescription for marijuana, but that
didn't stop <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/oh/">Ohio</a> state troopers
from arresting him in July 1995 when they
found some in his car after a traffic stop. However, the judge would've let
him smoke it in jail.</p>

<p>McCormick has a prescription from a doctor in the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/Netherlands/">Netherlands</a> to use
marijuana for chronic pain resulting from ten childhood bouts with cancer.
He is trying to start a group in his hometown of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ri/Providence.html">Providence</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ri/">Rhode Island</a>,
that would give marijuana to the seriously ill. McCormick's effort is
reminiscent of activists who smuggled in FDA-unapproved drugs to combat
AIDS. The AIDS drug buyers' clubs eventually caused the FDA to loosen its
restrictions.</p>

<p>Unable to raise his $150,000 bail, McCormick argued before a judge that
he required marijuana for medical purposes. Since the age of 2, McCormick
has undergone extensive treatment for cancer of the spine, skull, right ear
and left hip, as well as a tumor between his heart and lung. He first began
smoking marijuana at age ten to combat nausea and dizziness associated with
radiation therapy.</p>

<p>Judge Anthony Gretick ruled that McCormick could smoke marijuana in jail
if a local doctor agreed with the medical necessity. The issue will not be
tested, however, because McCormick was able to make bail when it was
lowered to $20,000.</p>

<p>"There are alternative therapies as good if not better than smoking
marijuana for all of the medical conditions for which there have been
requests for medicinal marijuana, including chronic pain," said Rayford
Kytle, a spokesman for the Public Health Service, which in the U.S.
controls all legal access to marijuana for medical purposes. The question is,
why does Kytle get to make that decision for someone else?</p>

<p>If convicted, McCormick faces up to thirty years in prison.</p>

prescriptions will be tested," in the September 18, 1995 <cite>News and

<title>China Gets Tough</title>
<!-- Place: Guangdong, China -->
<!-- Time: March - September 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Can you get any tougher?</h1>

<p>All we need to win the war on drugs, I am told, is to "get tough."
I'm not sure what "tough" is, but if execution ain't it I don't know
what qualifies.</p>

<p>The September 1, 1995 San Francisco <cite>Examiner</cite> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Authorities in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/China/">China's</a> booming southern
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/China/Guangdong.html">Guangdong</a> province
have executed
14 people for drug trafficking and robbery in the provincial capital,
Guangzhou, the Yangcheng Evening News said.</p>

<p>The executions Thursday were the latest in a province-wide crackdown that
officials say has netted 6,000 people for drugs offenses since March.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now if getting tough works so well, why is one Chinese province still
arresting nearly 1,000 people per month on drug charges? This recalls China's
penalty against opium smuggling in the 1800's: beheading for the smuggler and
enslavement for his family.</p>

<p>Also notice the reference to the province's "booming" economy. If drugs
are such a drag on the economy as prohibitionists claim, then why is a province
with such a drug problem doing so much better than the rest of China?</p>

<title>Marrou Ads</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: report January 20, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Marrou Ads</h1>

<p>January 20, 1993, from
<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/SteveGivot.html">Steve Givot</a>:</p>

<p>The Clock ad, on the other had, produced 4 people more likely to vote for
Andre and Nancy (as a result of seeing the ad) for each 1 person less likely
to vote for them.  This ratio (4:1) is <em>clearly</em> superior to the ratios
for the two issues ads (4:9).</p>

<p>The Clock ad testing also indicated that it would produce significantly more
calls than any of the other two ads tested.  At least 33% more calls.  
That makes it <em>clearly</em> superior on that measurement.</p>

<p>There were numerous other responses that the testing measured.  Interviewees
were asked to rate the ads using a list of positive adjectives which the
designer of the test provided.  These included:  thought-provoking (1),
warm and human (3), clever(1), entertaining(4), sincere(1), 
informative(3), interesting(tied 2), educational(1), an ad for people 
like me(2), made me angry with typical politicians(3), trustworthy(tied 3),
and better than most political advertising(1).</p>

<p>The numbers in parentheses indicate its ranking among the four ads tested.
(1) is the best result.  The sum of these for the four ads is as follows:</p>

<pre>
	Clock           26.0
	Bad Images      35.5
	Waste           28.0
	Winds           30.5
</pre>

<p>The lowest score was the best score.  The best possible score was 12.  
The Clock ad slightly edged the Waste ad in this tally.</p>

<p>The interviewees were also asked to rate the ads using a list of negative
agjectives.  These were:  offensive(3), made me angry with advertiser
(3), worse than most political advertising (tied 3), untrue(4), confusing
(3), and inappropriate(tied 3).</p>

<p>The numbers in parentheses indicate the ranking of the Clock ad among the
four ads.  (4) is the best result.  The sum of these for the four ads is
as follows:</p>

<pre>
	Clock           20.0
	Bad Images      11.0
	Waste           20.5
	Winds            8.5
</pre>

<p>Here the <em>highest</em> score was the best (i.e. least negative response).
 The best possible score was 24.   Clock was slightly edged by Waste on this
measurement.  Here you can clearly see that the most purely ideological
ad among them -- Winds of Change -- got an almost perfectly <em>bad</em> score.
That is to say that it almost always left a <em>negative</em> impression of the
interviewees.  It was clearly the most "offensive."</p>

<title>The Marrou Campaign</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Andre Marrou's Presidential Campaign</h1>

<p>From John Mcpherson (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]">
<a href="mailto:mcpherso@macvax.ucsd.edu">mcpherso@macvax.ucsd.edu</a>):</p>

<p>Last night <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/AndreMarrou.html">Andre Marrou</a>
gave a speech to my Toastmaster Club, and I offer a summary of it, with his
permission.</p>

<p>He basically covered his post-campaign reflections on his experience 
as the Libertarian Presidential candidate, and offered some advice 
and answered questions from the audience.</p>

<p>Things we did right:</p>

<ol>
<li>Winning in Dixville Notch.  
   Note: he said that he had to fight his own people (campaign 
   management, staff, LP leadership) in order to do this.
<li>Getting 50 state ballot access (1.5 weeks before Perot did).
   Note: some state branches (eg, North Carolina) of the LP fought 
   against this, claiming that it was a national LP matter only.
   Note 2: The media should have reported this, but it was ignored.
<li>Having a woman on the ticket, especially in the "Year of the Woman".
   Neither the Demos, Repubs or Peros had a woman on the ticket.
   Note: the Press ignored all this.
<li>Getting 2 Libertarians elected, and 2 re-elected, in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire</a>.
<li>Using TV.
   Note: he had to fight the LP for that.  Many Libertarians seem
   stuck on print media, which has limited readership.  The electronic
   media is the way of the future.
<li>Having over 1000 Libertarian candidates down-ticket.
   Note: Perot's party had only about 10.
<li>Having a low "dollars per vote" ratio.
   (now only if we had more money ...)
</ol>

<p>Things we did wrong:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not enough money.
   We only had on the order of 10,000 contributors, and the average
   contribution was (only) about $25.
<li>We didn't bring a lawsuit against the Presidential Debate 
   Commission, which barred him from the debates.
   Note: he couldn't convince party leadership to do this.
<li>Not enough TV.
   He said that we should have spent almost every penny on it.
<li>The ongoing internecine war in the LP.
   Such divisiveness only hurts us.  If we have a complaint against
   another person, we should take it up with that person privately.
<li>Lack of a hierarchy.
   Although as Libertarians we often feel that our opinions are just
   as valid as everyone else's, this simply isn't true.  Some of us
   have had more experience and success, and are more capable of
   focussing efforts effectively.
</ol>

<p>The future of the LP:</p>

<ol>
<li>We should do what is necessary (without initiating force or fraud)
   in order to win.
<li>We need people with charisma (winning elections is basically a 
   personality contest), and who know how to explain our philosophy well
   to the "3 Ps": public, press and peers.  We need to make it more palatable;
   it's not necessary to water it down.
<li>We don't need to sell out in order to win elections, and, once in office
   a Libertarian will likely become more libertarian, not less.  As bad
   as you think government is, it is worse than that!
<li>Both Republicans and Democrats are socialists.  Republicans are right-wing
   socialists, and democrats are left-wing socialists.  He defines socialism
   as the transfer of money and power to the government.
   We want to get money and power back into the hands of the individuals,
   and we should emphasize this point.
<li>Both Republicans and Democrats want to mandate what they see as "good",
   and to prohibit what they see as "bad", and on many points they are on
   opposing sides.  Libertarians want neither to mandate nor prohibit, we
   want to put the choice back to the individuals.  In this sense, we
   occupy the _middle_ground_, and we would do well to present ourselves 
   as such.
</ol>

<h1>Go Bonnie!</h1>

<p>Bonnie Flickinger is the perfect example of what Libertarians can and
will do when elected to office. Flickinger won a seat on the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/MorenoValley.html">Moreno
Valley</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>
City Council in November 1992. The race was nonpartisan but
Flickinger is a registered
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian</a> and advocated
Libertarian goals during her campaign.</p>

<p>On December 14, 1993, by a 5-0 vote, the Moreno Valley City Council
appointed Flickinger as Mayor. Her one-year term began that night. Moreno
Valley, with a population of almost 140,000, is the largest city ever to
have a Libertarian mayor. Flickinger was re-elected to the City Council
in November 1994 and made Mayor Pro Tem in 1995.</p>

<p>Flickinger was nearly successful in repealing $7.5 million worth of
city taxes. In 1995, Flickinger tried to convince the city council to
allow residents to vote on the town's Utility Tax and Business Gross
Receipts Tax. She finally convinced enough members to get the measures
on the ballot, in exchange for voting for a unanimous resolution of
support for the taxes. On June 4, 1996, voters rejected both taxes
by a margin of 52% to 48%, and the taxes were scheduled to end
December 31, 1996. However, the taxes were placed on the ballot again
in November 1996, and passed.</p>

<p>After voting for the resolution, Flickinger announced she would not
campaign for or against the taxes but would correct any misinformation
put out by either side. Three other councilmembers denounced Flickinger,
threatening to censure her and remove her from appointed positions
including Mayor Pro Tem. Residents flooded Flickinger's office with
expressions of support.</p>

<title>Clark for State Senate</title>
<!-- Place: Nevada (USA) -->
<!-- Time: November 1992 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Libertarian Gets 46% in State Senate Race</h1>

<p>In 1992, Libertarian
<A href="/revolution/by_name/C/TamaraClark.html">Tamara Clark</a> won 46%
of the vote in a highly publicized race for State Senate in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nv/">Nevada</a>. Clark became
the first Libertarian endorsed for a state office by the Chamber of
Commerce, and the first Libertarian to receive the endorsement of
the Las Vegas <cite>Review-Journal</cite>, circulation 160,000, the
largest newspaper in the state.</p>

<p>Clark and several Republican candidates levied charges of fraud
after the election. Early returns showed Clark ahead 56%-44%, but
after the state election computers "had to be shut down" for an hour,
the final vote turned out to be the reverse, with Clark losing.</p>

<title>Cal Warburton</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Cal Warburton (1910 - 1995)</h1>

<p>Calvin "Cal" Warburton was the first sitting legislator to switch
parties to the
<A href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>, and the
first Libertarian legislator
in the lower 48 states. Warburton was a Republican State
Representative in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire</a> when,
at age 81, he switched to the Libertarian Party.</p>

<p>"I have joined the Libertarian Party because it is the party of 
freedom -- economic freedom, personal freedom, social freedom, and judicial 
freedom," Warburton announced at a July 16, 1991 press conference in the
Legislative Office Building in Concord, New Hampshire. Warburton had served
seven terms in the New Hampshire state legislature as a Republican.</p>

<p>In 1992, Warburton was re-elected to the state legislature as a Libertarian
representing Raymond and Epping. Warburton declined to run for re-election
in 1994.</p>

<p>As a Libertarian legislator, Warburton filed bills to allow property tax
abatements for parents who sent their children to private schools, require
the state government to divest of private businesses, curb the soaring
spending in the state's Executive Department, and repeal a business tax
increase introduced by the Republican governor. All measures were defeated
by Republicans and Democrats in the legislature.</p>

<p>Before he became a legislator, Warburton earned a degree in theology
from Boston University, served as an Army chaplain for eleven years, and
was a Methodist minister in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ks/">Kansas</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ma/">Massachusetts</a>
and New Hampshire.</p>

<p>Warburton was very active in the Libertarian Party, serving two
terms in the state legislature, running unsuccessfully in 1992 and 1994
for the party's gubernatorial nomination, speaking at Libertarian meetings
across the state, advising Libertarian candidates and working the polls
on election day.</p>

<p>Warburton underwent surgery for an aorta aneurysm in early December 
1994, which left him in a coma. He recovered from the coma, and remained
active in the Libertarian Party until his death, on October 18, 1995, at
age 85.</p>

<h1>Ron Paul</h1>

<p>Ron Paul was the 1988 presidential candidate of the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>.
Paul had previously served four terms as a Republican U.S. Congressman,
switching to the Libertarian Party after he lost the Republican

<body>

<h1>Givot for Senate</h1>

<p>In 1984,
<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/SteveGivot.html">Steve Givot</a> ran for
U.S. Senate in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a>. In defending
another campaign's hard efforts against armchair quarterbacks later in 1996,
Givot described his campaign:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My 1984 senate campaign raised $125,000, got five major national
endorsements from conservative/Republican bigwigs (not counting then-sitting
Congressman
<a href="/revolution/by_name/P/RonPaul.html">Ron Paul</a> and the
Chief Economist of Chase Manhattan Bank).</p>

<p>I was hounded by the media for interviews after the endorsements.  I
appeared on virtually every television station in the state -- at their
behest.  I flew more than 50,000 miles to blanket Illinois during the
campaign.  I testified before the Joint Economic Committee of the U. S.
Congress.</p>

<p>I stopped working and campaigned full time -- at least 5 days each week
-- from April 1.</p>

<p>The result:  about 60,000 votes (roughly 1.25%).</p>

<title>'96 Libertarian Convention</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: report January 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Moving the Convention to '96</h1>

<h2>1994 Perspective</h2>

<p>January 3, 1994, from
<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/SteveGivot.html">Steve Givot</a>, responding
to criticisms from Bob Hunt,
of the LP-US's decision to move the presidential nominating convention from
1995 to 1996:</p>

<blockquote>
1. Was the "collective judgement" that we would still get our presidential
ticket on the ballot in all 50+DC states?
</blockquote>

<p>The LNC did not take a vote on this matter, so no one can say.  However, it
was the collective judgement of the LNC to move the convention to the summer of
1996, knowing that this posed some additional risk to 50+DC ballot access.  The
LNC also knew that we wouldn't have standing in court to sue the states which
pose a problem until we were under contract to have our convention in 1996.  So
it would be impossible to bring the issue of fair ballot access in these states
to court until we did so.</p>

<blockquote>
2. Was the "collective judgement" that a more "media timely" convention in
June/July 1996 more important than 50+DC ballot?
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the LNC did not vote on this particular issue.  However, media
timeliness and standing to file suit were among the several issues which argued
for the 1996 date.</p>

<blockquote>
3. Was any consideration given to a "media timely" convention compromise, such
as a 1996 convention shortly after the NH primary, ie. late Feb/early March?
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, this was considered both by the Convention Oversight Committee and
the LNC.  Please keep in mind that the LNC discussed this matter at many
meetings over the course of several years.  Dates as early as January,
1996 and as late as August, 1996, were discussed at various times.</p>

<blockquote>
4. Was any consideration given to our ballot status and our legal claims of
being treated unfairly, if there is a miracle and all of the states with a
early deadline agree with us and extend those deadlines to late August?
</blockquote>

<p>I don't understand your question.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of discussion of our ballot status and our legal
claims of being treated unfairly.  That discussion made it clear that we have
no standing to bring suit until we are affected by the law in the clearest of
terms, i.e. we have a convention scheduled which will make it impossible to
comply and gain ballot access.  Thus, gaining such legal standing required is
to pick a summer, 1996 date.</p>

<p>Did the LNC explicitly discuss miracles?  Of course not.  However, if there
is a miracle and every state which poses a problem for us changes its laws so
that we can hold a summer, 1996 convention without any increased ballot access
burden, then scheduling it for summer, 1996, will not pose any problem.  Ipso
facto, such a miracle (given that we are now scheduled for Summer, 1996, in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">DC</a>)
<em>will not</em> cause any incremental hardship to the LP.</p>

<p>Miracles are always welcomed by the LP.  However, we cannot sit idly by
under the burden of onerous ballot access laws which are getting no easier (in
most problem states), and wait for them to change.  We must force the issue,
and that is what the LNC has done.</p>

<blockquote>
Would we have the resources in 1996 to respond with a successful ballot drives
in all of those remaining states during approximately 5 to 6 weeks ending in
August?
</blockquote>

<p>That depends on what happens in court, doesn't it?  If we win in court, then
we might have very little burden at all.  For example, there are precedents
that say that if the petitioning time is shortened by 50%, then the signature
requirement is reduced by 50%.  I'd say that is a very, very positive
development for the LP!</p>

<p>If we lose in court, then we will have done our best to try to force
fairness, and we <em>may</em> miss out on being on the ballot in a few states. 
But this will only happen in 1996, not in 2000.  I personally think it is worth
gambling to bring about <em>major</em> ballot access reform if the downside is
missing a few states <em>once and only once</em>.  If we don't try, we will
<em>never</em> succeed, Bob.</p>

<blockquote>
Never mind that we might be successful in any <em>one</em> of the problem 
states. Would/Could we have the resources to be successful in all of the
problem states in a contracted short period of time simultaneously?
</blockquote>

<p>That depends on the resources available at that time.  If we have done the
other states with mainly volunteer signatures because our members want to save
a hoard of money to deal with possible court losses, then we may be alright. 
If we are not in a good position in the other states and we don't have a pile
of money as a contingency against court losses, then we are in trouble.</p>

<blockquote>
It is bad enough that there are so many serious obstacles in so many "problem
states" At least with a protracted ballot drive period, we can concentrate our
1.) ballot drive organizing experts, 2.) ballot law experts, 3.) lawyers for
ballot challenges, and 4.) signature collection experts; on one or two "problem
states" at a time. We all know of past cases where we had the signatures, but
some state had to be saved because some "form" was not notorized or turned in
on time.
</blockquote>

<p>Well, this changes none of that.  Remember, the purpose of setting the date
<em>now</em>, is that the convention (and most ballot drives) start two years
from now.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the LP planned on filing the first lawsuit
(<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a> State,
I believe) <em>today</em>! Yes, today, because we planned on
signing the convention contract today, which means that we have legal standing
to sue.  This gives us two years to find out where our problems are.  By
January, 1996, (and maybe much sooner) we should know which states we have lost
in court, have appeals heard, and know where we stand.</p>

<p>This allows the "experts" plenty of time to plan for highly accelerated
petition drives in a few places, if need be.  It also gives us time to raise
the money needed to do them, in the event that more money is needed.</p>

<p>As for the screwups of various petition drives in notarization, turning in
signatures, etc., I can only say that this decision should have no effect on
that so far as I can tell.  If anything, if we are left with a few states where
we have very few days to get lots of signatures, then the several months from
January, 1996, through the convention will give us an opportunity to make sure
that we have very competent people in those few places to assure that the
amateurism you referred to does not crop up there.</p>

<blockquote>
And what would be the effect of our future legal standing, if despite state law
changes, we were not able to get on the ballot in 50+DC?
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure I understand this question, but I'll have a go at answering
what I think you are asking.</p>

<p>If the courts force the "bad" states to change their laws and we still fail
to get on the ballot, then I have no idea as to what our "future legal
standing" is.</p>

<p>If the courts say:  "Tough luck, LP.  You knew the law before you schedule
your convention, so you created the problem,"  I would be amazed.  That would
be like telling a black person in the 60's that he/she created the problem by
insisting on sitting in the <em>front</em> of a city bus in the south. I can't
see that happening.</p>

<p>If the courts say:  "We will pro-rate the number of signatures required
based on the percentage of day remaining for petitioning, and guaranteeing a
minimum of (reasonable number of days) in any event," then we should be
ecstatic.  If we still fail to get the job done, the I presume that we would
have to either (1) assess whether or not (knowing the law for 2000) we could do
it the next time, (2) decide to make the convention date a bit earlier in 2000,
or (3) revert to a 1999 convention.  All of these options are open to us. 
Remember, this decision was for 95 vs 96 only.  No determination as been made
regarding any future convention dates.</p>

<blockquote>
I am worried about the effect of this (what I unfortunately think is a
premature) policy change.
</blockquote>

<p>I understand your worry.  I think that most LNC members who supported the
1996 date share some of it.</p>

<p>What concerns me is your use of the word "premature".  Making a commitment
to a date which gives us legal standing is <em>inherently risky</em>. Period.
If there were no risk, we would not have standing and would not have a court
case.  Ipso facto, we must be at risk to force the issue to the courts.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can tell me when it would not be "premature" to make such a
change for the purpose of forcing the issue to the courts.  I suggest that the
real issue is how much risk you (or the LNC) feels should be taken in order to
make a difference.</p>

<p>The LP itself is inherently a risky enterprise.  It, and its candidates,
spend millions for what is essentially very long shots at electing a few
candidates to local office (except in Alaksa and NH).  We spend about $1
million every four years with <em>no</em> chance whatsoever of electing a
president.  This isn't even a long shot - it is a non-shot.  But we do it
anyway.  Why?  Because we need to keep pushing the system to its limits in
order to budge it a bit.</p>

<p>That is all that this is doing.  50+DC is a big deal, but it is only a small
step toward electing a president, or even having a good enough showing to be
really noticed and "included" four years later.</p>

<p>That's why I think it is worth the risk.  I want to work towards winning. 
50+DC is <em>not</em> winning.  Changing the laws so that nearly half of our
resources and efforts don't have to be expended on ballot access <em>is</em>
worth doing, and <em>will</em> make it easier to have 50+DC forever.</p>

<h2>Early 1996 Perspective</h2>

<p>From a February 27, 1996 message to the LPUS mailing list by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/W/RichardWinger.html">Richard Winger</a>:</p>

<p>Having the Libertarian Party national presidential convention in July 
1996 instead of September 1995 is an experiment.  We won't be able to 
evaluate it until this calendar year is almost over.  I was in favor of 
this experiment, but so were plenty of other people.</p>

<p>I was in favor of it mostly because people who pay attention to 
politics will (in theory) think of the Libertarian Party as a "real" 
political party, if the LP imitates the Republicans and Democrats and 
nominates in the summer of the presidential election year, and also if 
the Libertarian Party uses its own presidential primaries to help it 
choose its nominee.</p>

<p>However, I know that the LP isn't yet in the same league with the Dems 
& Reps, and it may very well be that the practical advantages of an 
early convention will turn out to be greater, than the advantages of a 
summer of the election year convention.</p>

<p>But there have already been concrete gains, because of our decision to 
nominate in the summer of 1996.  Specifically, the states of Kentucky, 
Massachusetts, Ohio, Oklahoma, Virginia, Washington state, West 
Virginia, as well as D.C., all changed their laws (administratively or 
legislatively) to permit unqualified parties to petition, BEFORE that 
gorup has chosen its presidential candidate.  Furthermore, there are 
bills pending in the Iowa and New Hampshire legislature to authorize 
this.  Therefore, we can say that the Libertarian Party has contributed 
to political freedom.  These are gains not just for our freedom to 
maneuver, but for all non-established political parties freedom.  And I 
suspect there will be additional legal gains in this area, in the next 
few months.</p>

<p>Also, the summer 1996 convention date makes it possible for anyone 
seeking the Libertarian Party nomination to attempt to qualify for 
primary season matching funds.  Under the old schedule, this was 
literally impossible.  Obviously, the ability to qualify, is distinct 
of the question of whether to accept the money.  The ability to qualify 
is a gain, because it is a concrete marker of success that may come in 
handy later, relative to debates, etc.</p>

<h1>Governor Appoints Libertarian to Liquor Commission</h1>

<p>From Eric Werme USSG (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:werme@zk3.dec.com">werme@zk3.dec.com</a>):</p>

<p>On August 24th, 1993, Governor Steve Merrill(R) of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire</a> announced
his intent to appoint Libertarian Miriam Luce to the state's liquor commission.
 She will replace a Democrat who was forced to step down for using his
influence
as a member of Manchester, New Hampshire's police commission to get a liquor
broker's arrest for DWI reduced to speeding.</p>

<p>The state liquor board has three commissioners, and state rules mandate
that the board must not be composed of members of a single political
party.  The other two commissioners are Republicans, and all the
speculation on who would be appointed to the spot centered on Democrats.</p>

<p>The early coverage I've seen has been positive from politicians, including
the
Democrats.  This may have something to do with the Democrats saying that
the commission should be privatized (I assume because they've always been
in the minority on the board), and Luce also has supported privatizating
the board in her gubernatorial campaigns in 1992 and 1990.  The head of the
state employee's union and some of the liquor brokers are more concerned
about what Luce's impact may be.</p>

<p>Luce promises to leave her philosophical views are the commission door.
Candidate Luce: "State government has become the supreme vice lord of New
Hampshire, running liquor stores and lotteries.. It is time these industries
were allowed to rise and fall in the private sector."  Nominee Luce: "I am
not a revolutionary. ... I was a candidate then, I have been nominated for
a position now and that position is managerial.  There is no preconceived
notion about what can or should be done and I mean that."</p>

<p>Governor Merrill: "What I would like to do is take a fresh look at how we
can deliver more for less."</p>

<p>As for commissioner Luce, that requires approval of the five member
executive council which will decide in two weeks.  The only councilor
to speak against Luce in public was Raymond Burton(R), who said that the
nominee should have come from the North Country.  Burton's district is
northern New Hampshire.</p>

<p>Luce is a management consultant and a graduate of Dartmouth's Tuck Business
School.  Her management background includes a multimmillion dollar operation in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York
City</a>, which she left to return to the friendlier confines of New
Hampshire.</p>

<h2>Libertarian to Join Liquor Commission</h2>

<p>August 26, 1993, from David Eagle (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:David.Eagle@f174.n132.z1.fidonet.org">David.Eagle@f174.n132.z1.fidonet.org</a>):</p>


<p>Concord, NH - In what has been heralded by state Libertarian leaders as
the biggest single breakthrough for the party thus far, two-time
Libertarian gubernatorial candidate Miriam Luce of Windham has been
picked by New Hampshire Governor Steve Merrill to replace a scandal-tainted
member
of the state's three-person Liquor Commission.  If confirmed, Luce's
nomination would mark the first appointment of a Libertarian to a
statewide office in the United States.</p>

<p>  "I'm choosing a woman of talent and ability," Merrill said at an
August 24th State House new conference, one day before officially
nominating Luce.  The official nomination will take place at the 
August 25th meeting of the state Executive Council, which approves or 
rejects all gubernatorial nominations.  Merrill called attention to
Luce's interest and expertise in marketing, her managerial skills,
her MBA from Dortmouth's Amos Tuck School of Business Administration,
and her "outstanding integrity and outstanding competence."  Merrill
said he got to know Luce during last year's gubernatorial campaign,
when he had "debated her, and on occasion been whupped by her."</p>

<p>  "One of the hardest calls I ever made was the call to Miriam Luce
to ask if she would accept this nomination."  Merrill said he
realized that Luce was "not necessarily the greatest spokesman" for
state bureaucracy.  "And I have an idea that Miriam Luce's high
school yearbook has no caption under her picture which says 'hopes
to grow up to be a liquor commissioner'."</p>

<p>  Luce said she "was genuinely surprised" nearly two weeks earlier
when she got a call from Merrill.  "After due consideration and
consultation I decided to accept the Governor's nomination."  Luce
said she would enter the position, if confimed, "with no preconceived
notions," and would apply herself to learning the job.  She said her
nomination "endorses the notion that we have brought to the
marketplace of ideas some concepts that have merit, and are worth
examining and possibly implementing."  She called New Hampshire
"arguably the most Libertarian state in the country."</p>

<p>  Luce, who ran against Merrill and Democrat Deborah "Arnie"
Arneson in 1992, first won major party status for New Hampshire
Libertarians with her 5% vote showing in the 1990 race for 
Governor.  The fact that during her two campaigns for Governor
Luce said repeatedly that the state should get out of the liquor
business, calling state government, with its liquor and gambling
monopolies, "the biggest vice-lord in the state," led some in the
media and in state government to suppose that her nomination is
intended as a first step toward privatizing state liquor stores.
But state Libertarian Party chair Doug Harrigan said people must
realize that Libertarians have no illusion that their philosophy
can be implemented at once.  "Pragmatically, you have to have
consensus before you can effect change," he said.</p>

<p>  Luce, 44, is a former International Paper Company manager and
commissioned securities dealer.  If confirmed, Luce could begin
serving her 6-year term as Commissioner soon after out-going Roger
Boisvert's planned September 17th departure from office.  The
full-time, business-heavy workload of the $45,088 - $57,824/yr.
post might leave Luce no time for either of her two current weekly
radio talk shows.  Reporters suggested the commission job might also
serve to conveniently keep Luce from mounting another campaign
against Merrill for Governor next year.  But in spite of her growing
and politically valuable radio listenership, Luce had previously
said she would not run again for Governor.</p>

<p>  Although Luce's nomination to a previously Democrat-held office
might understandably have disappointed them, leading House Democrats
gave a ringing endorsement of Merrill's choice.  Assistant Democratic
whip Peter Burling called Luce "extraordinarily competent, intelligent and
introspective -- a really good appointee.  She would fit well into
our look at downsizing the commission."  House Democratic Leader Rick
Trombly called on Merrill to "retain Ms. Luce as the sole liquor commissioner
once [Democratic] legislation becomes law.  We firmly believe that he should
have his appointee in office when the streamlined liquor commission comes into
being."  Trombly also said he "would like to welcome the Libertarian Party
into their new active role in the administration of state government.  They
have proven themselves as legislators.  We look forward to their success in
the administration."</p>

<p>  Not all had good things to say about the Luce appointment, however.  Chris
Henchey, chief negotiator for the NH State Employees Association said that
while Luce is certainly qualified, "our concern is one of privatization.  We
need to get a real close look at this nominee, given the Libertarian
foundations -- their tendency to want to dismantle government.  There's some
real question about balance -- the Tuck MBA versus the strong campaign stands
she took."</p>

<p>State Libertarian Party spokesmen were clearly elated by Luce's nomination.
</p>

<p>"I think the Governor made an absolutely brilliant move in appointing
Miriam,"
said House Libertarian Leader
<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/DonGorman.html">Don Gorman</a> (L-Deerfield).
 "This action is
sending out more damned messages to more major players than you can believe. 
The fact that the Governor recognizes the usefulness of a Libertarian in this
role demonstrates not only his political savvy, but the fact that we have
advanced in stature to the point where a governor would feel comfortable
associating with us in this fashion.  Miriam's appointment should certainly be
the death-knell for the word 'bi-partisan' in this state, and we can thank
Steve Merrill for recognizing that New Hampshire is truly  tri-partisan'!"</p>

<p>  Harrigan said Merrill had "simultaneously shaken up the political
establishment, helped legitimize the Libertarian Party, and put legislators on
notice that he thinks the Libertarian small-government philosophy has a place
in state government.  It's a big day for us -- at least as big as placing an
official Libertarian delegation in the House in last year's election."</p>

<title>Gorman Runs For Speaker</title>
<!-- Place: announcement Concord, New Hampshire (USA) -->

<body>

<h1>Libertarian Legislator Seeks Speaker Role</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian</a> state
legislator
<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/DonGorman.html">Don Gorman</a> announced
in May 1996 that he is running for Speaker
of the <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire</a>
House. The 400-member House will elect a new speaker in mid-December 1996.</p>

<p>Gorman's strategy is to assemble a coalition of Democrats, who lack
the votes to elect one of their own as Speaker; disaffected Republicans;
and any new Libertarian legislators elected in November. If elected,
Gorman promises to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Give the State & Federal Relations Committee "the new charge of 
ending unconstitutional Federal mandates.
<li>"Create a Sunset Committee to reduce and streamline our cluttered 
and cumbersome RSAs [state laws.]"
<li>"Strengthen the involvement and participation of every member."
</ul>

<p>Gorman has spent eight years as a member of the N.H. House; 1993 to 
1996 as a Libertarian, and 1973 to 1976 as a Republican.</p>

<title>Libertarians End Roadblocks</title>
<!-- Place: New Hampshire -->
<!-- Time: passed by house March 1996;

<h1>Libertarian Helps End Roadblocks</h1>

<p>In June 1996, a
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian</a>-sponsored law
ended random drunk-driving roadblocks in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire</a>.</p>

<p>House Bill 1285, introduced by State Representative
<A href="/revolution/by_name/G/DonGorman.html">Don Gorman</a>
(L-Deerfield), requires police to get permission from a judge before 
setting up drunk-driving roadblocks, and requires the judge to affirm that 
"all constitutional guarantees are met." The bill passed the state house
in March, and the state senate in April. It became law after the governor
neither signed nor vetoed the bill within five days.</p>

<p>"Roadblocks of this type infringe on the right of law-abiding citizens
to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The New Hampshire State
Constitution, as interpreted by the State Supreme Court (<cite>State vs.
Koppel</cite>, 1985) clearly indicates that New Hampshire residents are
entitled to greater protection against these types of 'no-reason' stops
than is provided for in the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution," Gorman
said.</p>

<p>"During a six-month period, the Concord police department conducted 47
checkpoints, making 1,680 stops and 18 arrests for Driving While
Intoxicated. During the same period, routine patrols using traditional
methods arrested 175 for DWI. Clearly, the checkpoints are ineffective as well
as unconstitutional."</p>

<h1>Libertarian City Councilwoman Causes Controversy</h1>

<p><a href="index.html">Libertarian Party of California</a> member Sandi Webb 
was elected to the Simi Valley,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>,
city council. Since then, she has garnered much attention as a result
of her strongly held views, particularly with respect to firearms
ownership.</p>

<p>Webb first made headlines by advocating carrying weapons for self-defense
even when government officials refuse to issue a permit. Webb herself
routinely carries a handgun.</p>

<p>Webb was re-elected to her city council seat in 1994.</p>

<p>At a March 12, 1996 League of Cities reception in Washington, D.C.,
Webb stood up and gave Senator Diane Feinstein the bird when Feinstein
asked everyone to support her assault weapons ban. The incident made
national headlines, and Webb issued an apology. "I will fight to the
death if I think I'm right, and I will stand and take my lumps if I
think I'm wrong," Webb said.</p>

<h1>Don Ernsberger</h1>

<p>Don Ernsberger is a long-time libertarian activist. In a November 1996
message to the LPUS mailing list, Ernsberger gave his reasons for leaving
politics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the conclusion of the 1996 LP National Convention last July I ended
my 32 year involvement in politics and 25 year involvement with the
Libertarian Party ... The American culture is fundamentally anti-ideological,
hostile to and fearful of personal liberty ... I have ended my Don Quixote
days.</p>

<title>Jon Coon on Bill Thomas</title>
<!-- Place: Michigan (USA) -->
<!-- Time: August 7, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>Jon Coon on the Bill Thomas Show</h1>

<p>From Mike Devour (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:mdevour@msen.com">mdevour@msen.com</a>):</p>

<p>Sunday evening, August 7, during envelope stuffing for the post-primary
newsletter, a supporter called Headquarters to alert Jon Coon to an invitation
to call from talk-radio host Bill Thomas (WXYT-AM). Jon called and was soon on
the air ...</p>

<p><b>Thomas:</b> On the line with us we have the Libertarian candidate for
[U.S.] Senate, Mr. Jon Coon. Jon thanks for being on the show.</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> Well thanks for having me on.</p>

<p><b>Thomas:</b> Obviously you heard we were talking about you yesterday.</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> Well we have a <em>whole</em> lot of supporters who listen to
WXYT all the time.</p>

<p><b>Thomas:</b> Well I appreciate it.</p>

<p>Listen, ... people ... were so incensed with the way it turned 
  into that mudslinging the last nine days that they were 
  considering going outside the party. A number of callers 
  called back and said "You're biting off your nose to spite 
  your face. Jon Coon is unelectable because he's outside the 
  two party mainstream."</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> That usually comes from Republicans and I've heard that very 
  same comment quite a bit during the course of this campaign. And 
  the fact of the matter is if we are to have any chance of winning
  this election--and we believe we do--we have to pull just as many
  Democratic votes as we pull Republican votes. And make no mistake
  about it we are in this campaign to win it, and from day one 
  we've targeted Democratic votes.</p>

<p>The Democratic party in the state of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan</a> just did the best 
  thing on earth they could have possibly done for this campaign. 
  They elected the weakest candidate in the field -- they gave us 
  Bob Carr. </p>

<p>And, really, the Republican party did the same thing, quite 
  frankly. I think the people of this state would have been better 
  served with Ronna Romney. That's not what they gave us to choose 
  from, they gave us Spencer Abraham. </p>

<p>And I don't want to get into the mudslinging game with my 
  opponents either, but I think to a lot of the people in this 
  state it's coming down to a race between a beltway politician, 
  a beltway politician, and a Libertarian.</p>

<p><b>Thomas:</b> For the people who don't know, explain the Libertarian
Party.</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> Well, the Libertarian Party believes in freedom -- and that's
  usually where the press quits talking about us. They like to give
  people the impression that that's all we believe in -- is having 
  people running around free to do anything that they want.</p>

<p>Well that's not true. The Libertarian Party understands what 
  freedom is about, what it really means, and <em>that</em> means that 
  we believe in the responsibility that goes along with it.</p>

<p>We want the government to be out of your economic life and out 
  of your personal life. We want you left free, pretty much to run 
  your own affairs. And we want you to accept responsibility for 
  your decisions. That's pretty much what you're going to find 
  written in a little book I carry around with me all the time 
  called the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<p>Thomas: Well it sounds like a whole lot of what the people who call 
  me day in and day out say they're looking for in a candidate. ...
  How about individual rights? One of the things that people throw
  up to the Libertarian party once in a while is "Oh, you're for 
  legalization of drugs."</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> Well, I'll tell you what I want, Bill. I want to see a 
  situation develop in this country where we no longer make it 
  possible for drug dealers to profit by pushing drugs.</p>

<p>  The reason why we have such a drug problem in our schools today
  is because of the fact we've made it extremely profitable to do
  so. The reason we have a drug problem in our schools is because 
  the kid five lockers down from your kid is making a hundred bucks 
  a day selling the stuff, and that's the only reason it's there.</p>

<p>  You know, it's become a situation here where I'm not the only one
  that feels that way. I'm in real good company on this issue -- from
  William F. Buckley Jr., to the Mayor of Baltimore, to Thomas Bray
  right here in
  <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/Detroit.html">Detroit</a>
   -- all the way down the line to sixty federal
  court judges. Theres a whole lot of people out there who 
  understand that our current approach is not working. </p>

<p>  Now, does that mean we have to go out there whole-hog and change 
  everything we're doing overnight? Of course not! And we're not 
  going to do that in a six year Senate term from one Senator 
  either. But, I'll tell you this, I'm going to be looking at 
  solutions that make some sense rather than what we're doing today.</p>

<p><b>Thomas:</b> ...If people wanted to find out more about you and your 
  campaign, where would they get in touch with you?</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> Well, for those who aren't already familiar with us -- and 
  I've got to tell you it's a shrinking number ...</p>

<p><b>Thomas:</b> Yea, I would agree that it is a shrinking number ...</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> They can call 800 J-O-N C-O-O-N. And that'll ring right into 
  my campaign headquarters and we will get you <em>everything</em> you want
  to know.</p>

<p><b>Thomas:</b> Jon, I would like to...have you on the show, talk about 
  the issues with you, have...you take some calls about this. 
  Would you make yourself available?</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> Oh I'd love to do it. That's the only way to do it. Give us 
  an hour to chat and we'll come out real well.</p>

<p><b>Thomas:</b> Jon, thanks for calling.</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> Thank you.</p>

<title>Jon Coon Debate</title>
<!-- Place: Michigan (USA) -->
<!-- Time: reported June 13, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>Jon Coon Senate Debate</h1>

<p>From the June 13, 1994 <cite>Inside Michigan Politics</cite>, a bi-monthly
newsletter widely read by <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan</a> media and
political operatives, and edited
by Bill Ballenger, an often consulted expert on state politics:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"How about I take the first half-hour, and you take the second 
half-hour." -- A whey-faced E. Spencer Abraham, one of two 
Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate, to Libertarian nominee 
Jon Coon in the studios of WJR-AM on Memorial Day. Abraham was 
displaying how a candidate with what his campaign describes as 
"guts" reacts when he finds that his schedulers have boxed him 
into a debate with a Libertarian for an hour on live radio -- 
his voice goes up about two octaves, he demands a private 
audience with moderator Kevin Joyce, and he offers to split the 
difference with Coon rather than deal with him face-to-face.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spence is Jon Coon's Republican opponent in the November election.
Every time Jon and the opposition appears on the same stage, Jon 
gets the applause.</p>

<title>Ernsberger on the Howard Stern Convention</title>
<!-- Place: Albany, New York (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 23, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>LPNY 1993 Nominating Convention</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/E/DonErnsberger.html">Don
Ernsberger</a>:</p>

<p>This morning (Saturday April 23rd) I drove 4.5 hours to
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/Albany.html">Albany</a> to
attend the
New York Free Libertarian Party convention. I had been asked to serve as
Parliamentarian by State chair Vogel as well as
<a href="/revolution/by_name/C/TamaraClark.html">Tamara Clark</a>. By 8:00 AM
several hundred LP members as well as many "Howard Stern fans" had gathered at
the convention location.</p>

<p>The New York LPers had arranged an efficient registration system requiring a
letter for admission to the Hall as well as traditional registration process.
By 9:30 when Howard Stern and his staff arrived over 250 certified delegates
had been registered and had taken their place in the hall. Over 130 members
of the media were also present. Tamara Clark and the local LP group had
arranged a press room and a well organized media/press effort occured. Stern's 
arrival generated a "pep rally" atmosphere outside the hall and the
convention kicked off at 10:00 AM. In addition to the efforts of the New
York LP activists, volunteers from
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania</a>
(<a href="/revolution/by_name/F/JohnFamularo.html">John Famularo</a>, Tom
Brennen, Rick Schwartz and Jay Russell) helped keep the sessions orderly.
National Director and Communications Director: <a
href="/revolution/by_name/W/PerryWillis.html">Willis</a> and <a
href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWinter.html">Winter</a> were also
there to work with the media.</p>

<p>At 10:00 the credentials committee reported 372 eligible delegates with
<em>no</em> contested delegate slots. The credentals committee report was
accepted
by the body and the report of secretary concerning the six announced
candidates for governor was accepted. Nominations and seconds for the six
candidates were made and the convention heard a 12 minute presentation by
each candidate.</p>

<p>Inside the hall were about 130 press, 372 delegates, and about 50 staff and
observers. Outside the hall were another 200 or so Stern Fans.</p>

<p>The Stern supporters ranged from many "small l" libertarians to many who
were
only interested in book autographs and being fans. The convention plans were
to have all votes by paper ballot. At the opening of the vote a motion from
the floor was made to have a standing counted vote. This motion passed but
the protests of various delegates and candidates resulted in a substitution
of voting in alphabetic order by paper ballot.</p>

<p>The result of the first ballot was Howard Stern with 287 (253 needed to
nominate). The other candidate vote totals ranged from about 35 for Jim
Ostrowski to about 25 for Norma Segel to about 10 for Joe Brennen and
Dottie Lou Brokaw.</p>

<p>No clear favorite had emerged from long time LP activists. In his acceptance
speech, Howard Stern urged party unity and asked the delegates to pick his
choice for Lt. Gov. Stan Dworkin. Amid protests from a number of long time
LP activists regarding this choice, the body selected Stern's suggestion.</p>

<p>Dworkin is a former Democratic County offical who is pro-choice on abortion;
pledged to the death penalty, legalized gambling, and lower taxes. He voiced 
support for "studying the case for legalized marijuana". He appears to favor
"Jack Kemp like" economic reforms. Many LP activists do not regard him as a
"libertarian" however.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how the media covers this convention and the effect of
the Stern selections on the long term LP activists. Some saw the convention
as a "Stern takeover" ... a takeover by non-libertarians. Others saw it as a
chance to gain ballot status and massive publicity.</p>

<p>I personally found the typical "Stern supporter" to be both more libertarian
<em>and</em> more well behaved then I had expected. Howard Stern also impressed
many as being more serious and concerned with LP growth then expected.</p>

<title>Horwitz on the Howard Stern Convention</title>
<!-- Place: Albany, New York (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 23, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>LPNY 1993 Nominating Convention</h1>

<p>From Nathan Horwitz:</p>

<p>I've just read my mail and it seems that I am the only person on
Libernet who actually attended the NYLP convention. I'll try to clear up
some errors I've read in previous posts and give a short description of
what it was like.</p>

<p>First of all, there were a number of mentions of someone named "Flanner"
or "Flanz". In actuality, they were referring to Dr. Robert Flanzer who is a
longtime party activist and was our candidate for controller as part of the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/T/JeromeTuccille.html">Tuccille</a> for Governor
ticket in 1971. He never said (as has been reported)
that he would leave the party if Stern were selected, although he did make
mention of others who did say that. (Although he may have said that to some
reporter privately, I don't think that Dr. Flanzer is capable of leaving the
party.)</p>

<p>It's also been reported that Stern won 297-34. This is not an accurate
account. It's true that the #2 candidate only recieved 34 votes, but a few
other candidates were very close to this figure as well. (Ostrowski got 34;
Dottie-Lou Brokaw & Norma "108K" Segal both scored in the 20's) Stern himself
recieved 287. Combined, Howards opponents got about 100 votes.</p>

<p>Every article I have seen makes mention of "scantily clad women." There
was one woman who wore a shirt and a thong bikini all day. Another woman
stripped down to a thong bikini for about five minutes after it was announced
that Stern had won. Most of the women there were not dressed professionally
but they did keep thier clothes on.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got to the Italian American center (in Colonie NY, a suburb
of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/Albany.html">Albany</a>)
a little before 7am. There were a few other local Libertarians
there and about thirty people who seemed to be Stern fans. I passed out copys
of the world's smallest political quiz to everyone who would take them.</p>

<p>Things started to get going around 8am. The doors opened and we set up
inside. People and press started to arrive. People were asked at the door if
they were members. If they said yes, they were allowed inside where a more
thorough check was made. Every one was given a packet as they went in. It
had a nametag in it, but mostly was full of ads for various Libertarian
groups; <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LaissezFaire.html">Laissez-Faire
books</a>, <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html"><cite>Reason</cite></a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_name/F/FFF.html"><cite>Freedom Daily</cite></a>,
etc.</p>

<p>Howard Stern came in at about 10 AM with his gang. I'm not familiar
with who these people are, but I got the impression that all of his usual
sidekicks were with him. The only ones I recognized were David Peel and Tiny
Tim. The place went temporarily crazy and got very noisy, but it quieted
down soon enough. (Except for a couple of idiots who continued to shout out
bizare things like "Howard is God.")</p>

<p>Local resident and main convention organizer Jeff Russel started off
speaking with a bunch of Thank yous to us local people. Rebecca Wilber (the
only elected Libertarian in NY) gave the Keynote adress. Both of these were
difficult to hear as it was still noisy in the place and the press had
swarmed around Howard Stern in the back of the room.</p>

<p>Then State Chair Ludwig Vogel spoke. This was followed by the nominating
speeches for the candidates. Part of this I missed because I went outside
to hand out literature to the people who couldn't get in. Sandy Feld gave
a nice speech before nominating Norma Segal. The nominating speech for Stern
was given by someone named "Elephant boy".</p>

<p>Norma Segal gave a great talk about gun rights. Dottie Lou Brokaw gave
an excellent speech welcoming in the new members, and the dropped out of the
race. Howard Stern was surprisingly polite and seemed truly sincere. People
screamed like crazy every time he spoke. He was followed by Jim Ostrowski
who mostly talked about drug legalization and how much he hates Mario Cuomo.
This got him some cheers but he also got some boos. I think his sense of
humor was too low key and subtle for the Stern crowd.</p>

<p>Then there was a big fight about voting. Vogel favored a voice vote.
Others wanted a head count. What we finally did was a paper ballot, but it
was handled so badly that I'm not sure if it was any better than the first
two choices. At first, they had eight of us sitting by voting booths (mine
was for the letters A & B) and we were supposed to check off people's names
as they voted.</p>

<p>Then <a href="/revolution/by_name/E/DonErnsberger.html">Don Ernsberger</a>
(from the national LP-whose main job was to stand
around and seem self important as far as I could tell) took away the lists.
Instead of voting row by row, it was decided that they would call peoples names
out to let them vote! No one monitored if people were voting only once or not.
I could have voted many times if I wanted to. Eventually, this system broke
down to "EVERYBODY WHO'S NAME BEGINS WITH "L" SHOULD NOW VOTE."</p>

<p>This took quite a while. Throughout this time I was pleased to note how
respectful (!surprise!) Howard Stern had been. He spoke when it was his turn
and didn't make fun of the small size of the party. (and that would have been
very easy-the reason the days events had to end at four was because there was a
wedding later that night at the Italian American center. Can you imagine that
happening to the republicans?) I was also impressed with most of Stern's fans.
True, many were rude and obnoxious, but most listened attentively to the other
speeches and cheered in the right spots....the press though, what a rude,
unruly, disrespectful and badly behaved bunch they were! (there were a lot of
them-about one third of the attendees were in the press corps.)</p>

<p>Of course, Stern won. Things were OK up to this point, but got ugly when
it came time to pick Liuetenant Governor. We ended up picking Stern's hand
picked running mate, Stan Dworkin. It was done by voice vote and it definately
had that railroaded through feeling. There were some bad moments, like when
Vogel and Flanzer were fighting via microphone. Another bad moment came when
Dottie Lou Brokaw stepped aside as nomineee for lg. She endorsed Dworkin and
some older LPers seemed to see this as a sell out.</p>

<p>Things only got worse when Dworkin spoke. He only spoke briefly, but he
certainly did not seem like a Libertarian. He sounded like your typical
opportunist-no values politician whose only goal is personal political
advancement.</p>

<p>A few hours later we reconvened at The Ramada hotel for our banquet. I
won't go into that much, but in a poll that went around asking people at
the banquet who they voted for Ostrowski came in first, followed by Stern,
Segal, Brokaw, and Brennan. Stern was not at the banquet. The people at the
banquet were mostly the "old" LPers. As far as I could tell there were only
four "new" LPers there.</p>

<p>The next day (today, Sunday) the business meeting started out by removing
Vogel from presiding over the meeting.I guess the members must have been pretty
upset with him about everything. This was borne out when he later lost
reelection (to Gail Bova) by about a three to one margin. (for State Chair)
I won't bore you with all the details, but there was a movement to end the
convention on the grounds that we no longer had a quorum.</p>

<p>We chose Norma Segal to run for senate against Moynihan. James Conti was
probably the candidate who sounded the best-he was our choice for attorney
general, and Ed Geyer (who was not there!) is our candidate for controller.</p>

<p>Joe Brennan and Dottie Lou Brokaw won as the two vice chairs.</p>

<p>I can't remember who all the at-large comittee members are (Rich Moroney
and Fred Cookinham are two of them) but I thought it was interesting that
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/Buffalo.html">Buffalo</a>
 resident and non-Stern fan Ostrowski as well as new party member,
Buffalo resident and strong Stern supporter (with the unlikely name of) Jerry
Lewis both were elected at large.(The two had been arguing for a while during
the banquet.)</p>

<p>Well, thats all for now. I'll write back if there are new developments.</p>

<title>Stadium Bonds</title>
<!-- Place: San Diego, California (USA) -->
<!-- Time: filed December 1995; tried February 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Libertarians Block Stadium Bonds</h1>

<p>Two Libertarians have filed suit against the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/SanDiego.html">San Diego</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>
City Council, arguing that the city must hold a vote on a proposed
$66 million bond issue for the San Diego Chargers football stadium.
The suit will be heard by a judge in February 1996.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/G/SteveGreen.html">Steve Green</a>, Chair
of the Libertarian Party of San Diego County,
California, and
<a href="/revolution/by_name/R/RichardRider.html">Richard Rider</a>,
1994 Libertarian candidate for governor
of California, say that since general tax funds guarantee the bonds
against default, the bond issue must be approved by a two-thirds vote
according to the state constitution.</p>

<p>The lawsuit is delaying the bond issue and the corresponding improvements
to the stadium. The two Libertarians have attracted a good bit of attention,
including a lengthy profile in the December 24, 1995 San Diego
<cite>Union-Tribune</cite>. Said the newspaper:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was Rider -- dismissed by the political establishment
as Libertarian wacko -- who challenged the 1988 half-cent sales-tax 
increase that would have paid for new jails in San Diego County. The 
California Supreme Court declared the tax illegal in 1991. The result: San 
Diego taxpayers will save an estimated $1.6 billion, while California 
taxpayers may save more than $8 billion on the precedent set by the case, 
which California Lawyer magazine rated a 'blockbuster.'</p>

<p>... It was Green who led the 1993 battle against [a previous] bond 
measure. The result: Voters overwhelmingly rejected the $18 million plan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While many consider the pair to be taxpayer heroes, City Council members
have called them "mean-spirited," "contemptible," and 
opposed "to anything that is really good for this community." Green
responded, "The issue is whether or not the California constitution
ought to be violated by the City Council going ahead without a vote of the 
people."</p>

<title>Libertarian Appointed</title>
<!-- Place: California (USA) -->
<!-- Time: January 1996 -->

<body>

<h1>Libertarian Appointed to California Constitutional Convention</h1>

<p>In January 1996, longtime Libertarian activist and 1994 candidate
for governor <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/RichardRider.html">Richard
Rider</a> was appointed to the 21-member California Constitution
Revision Commission.</p>

<p>The commission recommends revisions to the California state
constitution. It is currently considering proposals to abolish
California's famous Proposition 13 limitations on property taxes
and the state's two-thirds vote requirement for new taxes.</p>

<p>Republican Curt Pringle, Speaker of the California Assembly, chose
Rider, well known for his opposition to tax and bond increases. Rider,
the only third-party member of the Commission, said, "In 
addition to pursuing my Libertarian desires for less government, I hope to 
represent the views of all third parties in terms of fair ballot access and 
representation in government."</p>

<p>In U.S. House races, there were more candidates on the ballot than usual,
with four- and five- way contests common, and even one six-way race. In 1994,
19 out of 30 Libertarian U.S. House candidates were in three-way races,
while in 1996 only 8 of the 42 candidates were in three-way races. This
resulted in a lower average vote total per candidate.</p>

<p>In the same election, voters approved measures prohibiting
affirmative action by state agencies and universities, and
legalizing marijuana for medical use.</p>

<p>Libertarians also ran in nonpartisan races:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calaveras County, California County Supervisor: Tom Tryon:
	re-elected</strong>
<li><strong>Tahoe City, California Public Utilities District Board, Director:
	Dennis Schlumpf: re-elected</strong>
</ul>

<h1>Jerome Tuccille</h1>

<p>Jerome Tuccille was one of the early leaders of the modern libertarian
movement. He wrote in several libertarian journals before the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
was established and became active in the party when it was.</p>

<p>Tuccille was the
<a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/lpny/">Free Libertarian Party
of New York's</a> 1974 gubernatorial
candidate. He garnered publicity by sending a blonde in a body suit riding
through Central Park on a horse named Taxpayer. <cite>Newsweek</cite> said
Tuccille "hardly believes in government at all," noting his support for the
free market; legalizing prostitution, abortion and drugs; and ending taxes,
subsidies, tariffs, quotas, land use controls and antidiscrimination laws.</p>

<p>In the 1980's Tuccille went on to become an investment author. His
son, J.D. Tuccille (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:tooch@aol.com">tooch@aol.com</a>) is also a writer, currently
an editor with the online version of the New York <cite>Daily News</cite>.</p>

<title>Stan Dworkin</title>
<!-- Place: New York (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Lieutenant Governor Candidate Stan Dworkin</h1>

<p>June 1994, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/JohnFamularo.html">John
Famularo</a>:</p>

<p>Many people have asked, "Who is Stan Dworkin"? Well, I would like to
provide a little information for this net.</p>

<p>I met Stan briefly at the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/Albany.html">Albany</a>
 convention, but did not get to speak to
him until a month later. He had already met with Dottie-Lou Brokaw where
they reviewed the LP Platform and libertarian philosophy. He took the
World's Smallest Quiz at the convention and scored 80/75. He also signed a
five sentence pledge required for membership in the NYLP.</p>

<p>He is taking this election very seriously and is devoting a lot of time and
energy in preparing for the upcoming campaign season.  His son Matt, a
student at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, seems to
be a pretty good libertarian too.</p>

<p>On Monday, June 20th Stan Dworkin addressed an assembly of Libertarians in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York
City</a> who had originally expected to hear Michael Moriority.  He
acquitted himself beautifully, and was warmly applauded by an audience that
was largely hostile just a few weeks before. The Statewide ticket of Stern,
Dworkin, Siegel, and Guyer will rely heavily on Dworkin in the coming
months, if as I expect, Stern will refrain from conducting a standard
campaign and refer the media to Dworkin.</p>

<p>Mr. Dworkin makes a good appearance and is well spoken.  He will be a
credible spokesman for the LP of New York. If you met him, you would like
him.</p>

<p>Mr Dworkin's curriculum vitae are as follows:</p>

<p>STANLEY H. DWORKIN<br>
8 EAGLE VIEW COURT<br>
MONSEY, NY 10952-4401</p>

<p>President, A.J. Tanner Ltd. Manufacturing advertising specialties and
items for the hat and fraternal regalia industry since 1980.</p>

<p>Age 45, married, wife Cathie and two sons, Matthew, 18, and Daniel, 14.</p>

<p>Prior to entering the business world he taught Social Studies, American
History, and Anthropology in Junior High School and High School.</p>

<p>Worked as researcher for Dr. Margaret Mead at the Museum of National
History.</p>

<p>MA in Anthropology from New York University.</p>

<ul>
<li>1980 - 1985, Sanitation Commission Member, Town of Ramapo
<li>1983 - 1985, Sanitation Commission Chair, Town of Ramapo
<li>1985 - 1993, Rockland County Legislature representing Ramapo;
        Majority leader (Democrat),
        Chairman of Labor Relations and Negotiations Committee,
        Chairman of Rules Committee,
        Chairman of the Crime Control Planning Board,
        Chairman of the Multi-Services Committee,
        Vice-Chairman of the Legislature,
        Vice-Chairman of the Budget and Finance Committee,
        Vice-Chairman of the Solid Waste Committee
</ul>
<ul>
<li>New York Board of Governors, Arthritis Foundation
<li>National Committee on Chapter Operations, Arthritis Foundation
<li>Nyack Hospital Corporation Board
<li>Rockland Association for the Visually Impaired Board
<li>Associate Board Member, local facility of United Cerebral Palsy
<li>Associate Board Member, Rockland Association for Retarded Children
<li>Past Chancellor Commander, Knights of Pythias
</ul>

<p>His disagreement with the Democrat Party leadership was over his refusal to
accept the patronage system and his insistence on the merit system.</p>

<p>If we are to become a majority at any time in the near future (25 years),
we need community leaders like Stan Dworkin to join our ranks and publicly
proclaim themselves as Libertarians.</p>

<title>1996 Pennsylvania Elections</title>
<!-- Place: Pennsylvania (USA) -->
<!-- Time: November 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>1996 Elections in Pennsylvania</h1>

<p>The <a href="index.html">Libertarian Party of Pennsylvania</a> ran
the following candidates for office in the November 1996 elections:</p>
<ul>
<li>US Representative District 6: Jerry L. Geleff 
<li>US Representative District 8: Richard J. Piotrowski:
	6,928 votes (3.1%)
<li>US Representative District 13: Patrick Burke: 4,942 votes (2.0%)
<li>Attorney General: Timothy William Collins: about 93,000 votes (2.3%)
<li>Auditor General: Sharon Shepps: about 104,000 votes (2.5%)
<li>State Treasurer:
	<a href="/revolution/by_name/F/JohnFamularo.html">John Famularo</a>:
	about 57,000 votes (1.4%)
<li>State Senate District 19: Tom McGrady 
<li>State House District 18: Charles Zatavekas 
<li>State House District 20: Charles Stutler 
<li>State House District 61: Sherry Rizzo 
<li>State House District 142: Matthew Stover 
<li>State House District 144: Don McGeady 
<li>State House District 145: Antoinette Hilmer 
<li>State House District 147: Bob Cassel 
<li>State House District 150: Hugh Braun 
<li>State House District 152: Peter Mergen 
<li>State House District 153: Brian McHugh 
<li>State House District 170: Steven Gilber 
<li>State House District 174: Joseph Sabatina 
<li>State House District 178: Darren Greway
<li>State House District 181: John Featherman 
<li>State House District 194: Joe McCarthy 
<li>State House District 202: Terry Zellers 
</ul>

<p>Burke's 5,000 vote showing for Congress was many times the margin
of victory of ten votes. The Democractic loser called for a recount.</p>

<p>The state party needed 2% in a statewide race to retain "minor party"
status, which it did. Minor party status allows voters to register in
the party, but petitioning is still required to get on the ballot.</p>

<title>Libertarian Party History</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1972 - 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>History of the Libertarian Party</h1>

<p>The Libertarian Party was founded in
<a href="/revolution/by_name/N/DavidNolan.html">David Nolan's</a>
Westminster, Colorado living room in December 11, 1971. The party
had 85 members in 1972. Its
<a href="election/1972/">presidential ticket</a> that year was on
just three state ballots and received less than three thousand votes.</p>

<p>The Free Libertarian Party of New York's 1974 gubernatorial candidate,
<a href="/revolution/by_name/T/JeromeTuccille.html">Jerome Tuccille</a>,
garnered publicity by sending a blonde in a body suit riding
through Central Park on a horse named Taxpayer.</p>

<p>Anecdote from <a href="/revolution/by_name/B/DavidBergland.html">David
Bergland</a> regarding the 1975 convention: "Roger brought political savvy,
but a somewhat limited understanding of the radical libertarian personality
of the delegates. This came to a head with the Vice Presidential nomination.
Two candidates for the position were not what Roger wanted. One, the late
(and great, in my view) John Vernon, was gay. The other, Jim Trotter, was a
gold smuggler. Well, that's all the delegates needed to go into an uproar
(rejecting MacBride's preference) and deadlock the convention because no one
of several candidates could get a majority. I was not then at the convention,
but was telephoned by friends, flew red-eye from L.A. to New York and was
nominated. Perhaps my most important qualification was being over 35. Not
many delegates attending were that old in 1975."</p>

<p>The <a href="election/1976/">1976 presidential ticket</a> was on 32
ballots and received 172,000 votes, establishing the Libertarian Party as the
third-largest party in the United States.</p>

<p>In 1978, <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/DickRandolph.html">Dick Randolph</a>
became the first Libertarian elected to office when he won a seat in the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ak/">Alaska</a>
House of Representatives. Randolph became instrumental in organizing the repeal
of Alaska's personal income tax.</p>

<p>The <a href="election/1980/">1980 presidential ticket</a> was on all 51
ballots and received nearly a million votes. The <a href="election/1984/">1984
elections</a> were not so kind after the major parties tightened ballot
access restrictions. The Party made a comeback in <a
href="election/1988/">1988</a> with the candidacy of former (and later)
Republican <a href="/revolution/by_name/P/RonPaul.html">Ron Paul</a>
getting half a million votes.</p>

<p>Libertarian <a href="election/">campaigns and elections</a> in the 1990s
have been strong. The Party has surged to new records, in officeholders,
candidates, appointments, membership and other areas.</p>

<title>Stern Announces Candidacy</title>
<!-- Place: Buffalo, New York (USA) -->
<!-- Time: March 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Howard Stern Announces Candidacy for Governor</h1>

<p>In March 1993, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York</a>
 "shock jock" Howard Stern announced he would
run for the Libertarian Party nomination for Governor of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New
York</a>.</p>

<p>Libertarians split over whether to accept or reject Stern as a candidate.
Supporters believed Stern could attract large numbers to the party and
help gain permanent ballot access. Opponents distrusted Stern's sincerity
and adherence to party ideas, and think Stern's image embarassed the
party.</p>

<p>Stern is the first celebrity to run for a Libertarian nomination. His radio
show is heard by an estimated 20 million listeners nationwide, in
several <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/">New York</a> cities,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/LosAngeles.html">Los
Angeles</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Dallas.html">Dallas</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/la/NewOrleans.html">New Orleans</a>,
Cleveland,
Boston and El Paso.</p>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission, which Libertarians advocate
abolishing, fined Stern's show $1.67 million for indecency. Stern's employer,
Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, is fighting the fines in court.</p>

<p>Stern's announcement has attracted significant attention to the Libertarian
Party. Geraldo Rivera did a show on the party, and the BBC called for
background, said
<a href="/revolution/by_name/C/TamaraClark.html">Tamara Clark</a>, the
party's national marketing director.</p>

<p>Stern's beliefs more or less fit with the libertarian philosophy. Stern
supports freedom of expression, individuality and drug relegalization. Stern
also supports the death penalty, an issue libertarians are divided on.</p>

<p>Among Stern's detractors is the former front runner for the nomination,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/Buffalo.html">Buffalo</a>
 lawyer James Ostrowski.</p>

<p>"He makes a living offending people with lowbrow, sophomoric humor. Is that
the type of guy who's going to accurately portray our ideas to the people of
New York?" Ostrowski said.</p>

<p>"For people who don't like Howard Stern's brand of entertainment, there's a
thing on the radio that changes the station or turns it off," said <a
href="/revolution/by_name/D/SteveDasbach.html">Steve Dasbach</a>, the party's
national chairman. "That's the idea of freedom of
individual choice that the Libertarian Party stands for."</p>

<title>Chuck Wills on the Howard Stern Convention</title>
<!-- Place: Albany, New York (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 23, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>LPNY 1993 Nominating Convention</h1>

<p>April 1994, From Chuck Wills (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a href="mailto:cwills@phantom.com">cwills@phantom.com</a>):</p>

<p>I was at the convention this weekend, and even though a lot of disturbing
things happened, I concur with M. Simkin in supporting Stern. (FYI, I've been
a paid-up member of the national LP for three years, the LPNY for two years,
and a Libertarian in spirit and in the voting booth since 1987. This was my
second LPNY convention. The opinions and reportage that follow are purely my
own.)</p>

<p>All of the news coverage played up the "invasion of the barbarians" aspect
of the convention, i.e. hordes of unwashed Stern fans rape and pillage tiny,
staid fringe political party.  In one story, Howard's assistant, Gary
Dell'Abate (AKA "Bababooie") was quoted as saying, "We disrupted their
chess-club meeting." When I read that, I felt annoyed. On reflection, though,
there's a lot of truth even in this snide statement.</a>

<p>Let's face it, most of us committed Libertarians spend too much time
debating the finer points of <a
href="/revolution/by_name/M/LudwigvonMises.html">Von Mises</a> and
relentlessly holding ourselves and
our candidates to inflexible standards of ideological purity. I believe that
if we're serious about advancing our cause and halting the erosion of freedom
of this country, we've got to (1) actually elect candidates, or at least rack
up vote totals that will force the press, public, and RepoCrat regulars to
pay some attention to us and our ideas; (2) focus on specific issues and
real-world solutions to the problems ordinary voters care about, instead of
just repeating the same old cliches to the same old clique of LP loyalists;
and (3) start acting like a real political party and not a little gang of
fellow-travelers. </p>

<p>Furthermore, I'm enough of an optimist to believe that most Americans (or
at least those not totally brainwashed by the left-centrist media) are
fundamentally Libertarian-they just don't realize it. We have to get our
ideas and policies out in the open and spread them to the widest possible
audience. If we can reach these people and explain what we stand for, we
might just get the groundswell of public support we need to become a viable
third party. The Stern candidacy, flawed as it is, could be a decisive
step-maybe even <em>the</em> decisive step-in this direction.</p>

<p>I say "could be" because, based on what I saw and heard in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/Albany.html">Albany</a>, a lot
depends on Stern's sincerity. I have to admit that Howard went out of his way
to reassure the LP loyalists that he wasn't just hijacking the party to get
the nod. While he was far from specific, he repeatedly said that he was not
just serious about running for governor, but that he was serious about
running as a Libertarian; that in his administration "the Libertarian
viewpoint would be heard"; and that he would appoint Libertarians to office
when elected. (I have to say that Howard actually appears to believe he can
win!) He also told the LP regulars that he was depending on their support.
Finally, Stern called for the regulars to work with the newly-minted Sternite
Libertarians, because, in his words, "these people are disenfranchised,
too."</p>

<p>Again, this is a statement that appears gratuitous at first but contains a
lot of truth. Most of the Sternites spent Saturday swilling beer, heckling
the LP regulars when they spoke, and ogling the "bikini babes" Howard brought
with him. But why are these people so obnoxious and nihilistic? Because, I
think, they realize in their guts that the present system in this state and
in this country is set up to screw them. They ARE disenfranchised; they know
the current political duopoly exists only to preserve and dispense power and
patronage. But they worship Stern and will follow where he leads. They would
support Howard if was running on the Socialist Workers Party ticket, but at
least Stern has brought these people into the political process even in a
peripheral way.</p>

<p>That said, I have no illusions that the vast majority of the Sternites
couldn't care less about the LP now that Stern has the nod. During the
convention, I heard the Sternites around me scoffing (to put it mildly) at
our support for second-amendment rights and even our anti-tax stance. (There
was a more positive response, as you might expect, when drug re-legalization
was mentioned.) But the fact is that Stern got around 400 people to plunk
down $15 and join the party-a rise in LPNY membership of between 50% and
100%, depending on whose figures you go by. We're fools if we don't at least
<em>try</em> to exploit this new resource. We probably can't hope to bring more
than a tiny percentage of the Sternites into the LP for the long haul, but for
a
party as small as ours, that's still a significant gain-and they say there's
no fanatic like the convert. </p>

<p>If I was the new state chair, I would get the membership list, analyze it
to separate the members who joined before March 31 (i.e. the Sternites) from
the LP loyalists, and "assign" ten of the former to each of the latter, with
a request that the loyalists call the new members, explain Libertarianism to
them, send them literature, and do whatever they can to get them on board for
real. Let's stop preaching to the choir and go out in streets among the
sinners.</p>

<p>Still, Howard's actions over the next seven months will do the most to
determine how the LPNY weathers this publicity hurricane. I heard party
loyalists voice the suspicion that Howard really is just exploiting the LP as
a vehicle to get publicity for himself and his show. Now that he's got the
nomination, the argument goes, he sees us as nothing more than useful dweebs
who will do the paperwork and legwork of the campaign. After all, he wasted
no time bundling himself and his entourage onto the bus after the nominating
process ended. "If he's so serious," said a prominent LP loyalist at the
Sunday business meeting "then why isn't here now?" Another pointed out that
Howard could at least have let real Libertarians put his name in nomination,
instead of two "wack pack" members, one of whom capped his incoherent
nominating speech by waving a plastic dildo from the dais. </p>

<p>These are valid points. Stern may come out on his radio show tomorrow and
slam the LP to his 20 million viewers. Or he may do the opposite. We'll just
have to see. Howard certainly gave a good impression of sincerity on
Saturday. But we all know how volatile and egocentric he is (and I say this
as longtime fan). </p>

<p>Of course, most of the LP regulars were at least resigned to Stern's
nomination. That was a foregone conclusion the minute Howard instructed his
radio audience to join up and come to Albany. The <em>real</em> drama of the
convention centered on the lieutenant-governor nomination.</p>

<p>The loyalists would have felt a lot better about Stern if he had allowed a
"real" major-league Libertarian (i.e., Segal, Brennan, Ostrowski, Brokaw) to
get the number 2 spot-especially as Howard is stating he'll resign as soon as
he gets his three-issue agenda through the legislature. But from the minute
he got on the dais, Howard relentlessly pushed his "hand-picked" running
mate, Stan Dworkin. And who is this guy? An obscure former Rockland County
legislator (a Democrat, I believe) who only joined the party on the day of
the convention.</p>

<p>From what I understand, Stern latched onto Dworkin (or vice-versa) because
the LP just couldn't shake Stern's belief that he had to have a "real"
politician on the ticket for his candidacy to be taken seriously. Dworkin
certainly doesn't know anything about us or what we stand for. Some hardcore
LP'ers demanded he speak a couple of times so we could at least get a sense
of where he stands. He talked about cutting waste and fraud, getting
government and "private industry" to work together, and so on-the standard
stump speech given by every politician from Clinton on down to your local
candidate for dog catcher. </p>

<p>Most of the loyalists were steady through the balloting for Stern, but when
Stern asked the convention to nominate Dworkin by acclamation so he could
leave the convention "in triumph" (his phrase), things got tense and ugly.
The word "putsch" was spoken. But in the end, Stern had more than enough
followers in the hall to get Dworkin onto the ticket in a voice vote. </p>

<p>In an obvious attempt at damage control-I think several hard-core LP'ers
were on the point of walking out-Dottie-Lou Brokaw said that Dworkin had
agreed to meet with her and learn more about Libertarianism. Unfortunately,
this was just before he made some particularly lame statements to the floor.
At the banquet that night, addressing and audience of (mostly) LP loyalists,
she expressed some regrets over throwing her support to Dworkin.</p>

<p>As with Stern, we'll just have to adopt a wait-and-see,
benefit-of-the-doubt attitude with regard to Dworkin. In a conversation with
me, one LP'er noted that Dworkin must have <em>something</em> motivating him to
leave his party and throw in with Stern and the LP. Maybe it's a
dissatisfaction
with mainstream politics that will translate into real Libertarianism. Or he
could simply be hoping for a ride past the press on Howard's coattails. </p>

<p>Finally, I think we NY LP'ers ought to remember Jefferson's comment on the
necessity of a little rebellion now and then. This is the biggest thing ever
to hit our poky little party. We may come out of it discredited publicly, we
run the risk of being torn apart internally, but the Sternite "rebellion" has
put the L-word in the public's eye, and I believe that in the long term this
will be to our benefit. </p>

<p>And at least things are interesting! It's as if the LPNY has been struck by
a bolt of lightning . I was at the 1993 convention, when all the delegates
fit into a conference room at the White Plains Hotel with room to spare.  If
anyone had said to me then that a thousand people would show up the next
convention, and that I'd see Lu Vogel and Joe Brennan sharing a dais with
Robin Quivers and Stuttering John Melendez, and that Howard Stern would be
nominated for governor, I would have said they were nuts. But it happened.</p>

<p>"I had a blast," said an LP regular to me on Saturday night. "I've been to
a lot of conventions, and this is the first time I've been to an LP
convention that felt like a <em>real</em> political convention." Amen.</p>

<title>1972 LP Campaign</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: October 1971 - November 1972 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>1972 Libertarian Presidential Campaign</h1>

<p>The Libertarian Party was founded in December 1971 and ran its first
candidates for President in 1972.</p>

<p>Presidential candidate <a href="/revolution/by_name/H/JohnHospers.html">John
Hospers</a> and vice presidential candidate <a
href="/revolution/by_name/N/TonieNathan.html">Theodora "Tonie" Nathan</a>
were on the ballot in two states. They received 1,111 votes in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/co/">Colorado</a>,
1,537 in <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a>, and
43 write-in votes in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ma/">Massachusetts</a>
for a total of 2,691. (I have seen elsewhere the total reported as 3,671.)</p>

<p>Hospers and Nathan made history when Republican presidential elector
<a href="/revolution/by_name/M/RogerMacBride.html">Roger
MacBride</a> refused to cast his electoral vote for Richard Nixon and instead
voted for the Libertarians. This made Libertarian Tonie Nathan the first woman
ever to receive an electoral vote.</p>

<title>1976 LP Campaign</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1975 - November 1976 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>1976 Libertarian Presidential Campaign</h1>

<p>The 1975 <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
national convention nominated
<a href="/revolution/by_name/M/RogerMacBride.html">Roger MacBride</a>
for President and
<a href="/revolution/by_name/B/DavidBergland.html">David Bergland</a>
for Vice President. MacBride had become a libertarian celebrity when he
cast an electoral vote for the
<a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/election/1972/">1972 Libertarian
candidates</a> as a Republican presidential elector.
The Libertarian ticket was on 33 ballots, and won 173,011 votes (0.2%).</p>

<h2>The 1975 Convention</h2>

<p>Bergland remembers, "Roger brought political savvy, but a somewhat
limited understanding of the radical libertarian personality of the
delegates. This came to a head with the Vice Presidential nomination.
Two candidates for the position were not what Roger wanted. One, the late
(and great, in my view) John Vernon, was gay. The other, Jim Trotter, was a
gold smuggler. Well, that's all the delegates needed to go into an uproar
(rejecting MacBride's preference) and deadlock the convention because no one
of several candidates could get a majority. I was not then at the convention,
but was telephoned by friends, flew red-eye from L.A. to New York and was
nominated. Perhaps my most important qualification was being over 35. Not
many delegates attending were that old in 1975."</p>

<h2>The Campaign</h2>

<p><Cite>The Atlantic</cite> described MacBride's ideas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Libertarian platform this year swings so quickly from left to right that
it will give you nosebleed. Here's a list of what they propose to abolish:
preventive detention, tariffs, import quotas, no-fault insurance, involuntary
commitment to mental institutions, compulsory drug programs, government-funded
research, the FBI and the CIA, right-to-work laws, minimum wage laws,
government access to personal papers, antigun laws, compulsory arbitration,
antidiscrimination laws, deficit spending, the Federal Reserve, antitrust laws,
farm subsidies, wage and price and rent and profit and production and interest
ceilings, income taxation, regulation of energy resources, federal control of
the Post Office, the Environmental Protection Agency, safety-belt and
crash-helmet requirements, any restrictions at all on the sale or use of any
drugs whatsoever, compulsory education, public schools, taxes on private
schools, busing, child labor laws, the National Labor Relations Act, welfare,
government poverty programs, Medicare and Medicaid and any form of national
health insurance, the Professional Standards Review Board, building codes,
zoning, eminent domain, regional planning, urban renewal programs, the
Occupational Safety and Health Act, Social Security, the Civil Service system,
campaign finance laws, ballot restrictions, foreign aid, the Export-Import
Bank, laws restricting trade with any nation or organization by a private
citizen, national claims to offshore rights, overseas Army bases, our
involvement with NATO and SEATO and other alliances, the Monroe Doctrine,
presidential emergency powers, membership in the United Nations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MacBride wrote a book, <cite>New Dawn for America</cite>, to support his
campaign. (Every Libertarian presidential candidate through 1988 was an
author.)</p>

<p>MacBride campaigned extensively, especially in the West. In the
<cite>Saturday Evening Post</cite>, he wrote, "Early Americans ... struggling
for survival in a hard wilderness ... grasped somehow that they were free, that
no authority controlled them ... That truth released a burst of creative human
energy such as the planet had never known, and created the modern world. The
American libertarian revolution swept away absolutist regimes and beehive
societies of much of the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">European</a> world, teaching freedom."</p>

<p>According to Bergland, "Roger bought a DC-3 (World War II vintage two
engine prop plane for you youngsters) and had it outfitted to fly to
campaign stops. It was dubbed 'No Force One' by Ed Crane, the campaign
manager."</p>

<h2>The Results</h2>

<p>The Libertarian ticket was on 33 ballots, and won 173,011 votes (0.2% of
total), up from 2 ballots and 3,000 votes four years earlier. Voter
turnout was 54.4%. FEC certified $24,264,593.88 for matching funds for fifteen
Republican and Democratic candidates.</p>

<a href="/revolution/by_name/K/DavidKoch.html">David Koch</a> for
Vice President. Clark had made an impressive effort in the 1978
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>
gubernatorial race, and David Koch was a millionaire who pledged to
contribute at least $500,000 to the campaign.</p>

<p>During the campaign, Clark urged independent candidate John Anderson to
withdraw from the race.</p>

<p>Clark received three daily newspaper endorsements. (Republican Ronald Reagan
received 443, Democrat Jimmy Carter 126, and independent John Anderson 40.)</p>

<p>Columnist Nicholas von Hoffman praised the consistency of the Libertarian
platform and the strength of Libertarian candidates' following the platform.
Hoffman railed that a vote for Carter, Reagan or Anderson is just "ratifying
what has been done, reaffirming it, and giving legitimacy to what will follow.
But a vote for Clark is something else again. It carries a message for now and
a threat for the future."</p>

<p><cite>People</cite> made a common criticism, that the Libertarian platform
"is seductive -- less government, more freedom -- but in specifics in becomes
less so. Libertarians call for an end to mandatory public education; phasing
out of social security and welfare; dismantling of all federal regulatory
agencies plus the FBI and CIA; a neutralist foreign policy; and the repeal,
among other things, of laws against abortion, gambling, drugs, and
prostitution."</p>

<p>What that boils down to, is that the difference between Libertarians and
other advocates of smaller government is that Libertarians mean it.</p>

<p>The 1980 Libertarian ticket was on all 51 ballots and won 921,299 votes
(1.05% of the total). Voter turnout was 53.95%.</p>

<h1>1984 Libertarian Election Results</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/lpil/givot.html">Givot for
	Senate</a>: 60,000 votes (1.25%)</li>
<li>Bergland/Lewis for President/Vice President: 228,314 votes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1984 Libertarian Presidential Campaign</h2>

<p>The 1983 Libertarian national convention nominated <a
href="/revolution/by_name/B/DavidBergland.html">David Bergland</a> for
President and <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/JimLewis.html">Jim Lewis</a>
for Vice President. Bergland was a Coast Mesa,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> lawyer,
had been the Libertarian 1976 vice presidential candidate,
and served as party chair from 1977 to 1981. Lewis was a salesman and
tax protestor.</p>

<p>Radio talk show host Gene Burns had been the frontrunner for the
presidential nomination, but withdrew a week before the convention when
he decided the party didn't have enough funding for a strong campaign.</p>

<p>The delegates quickly centered around Bergland as representative of
the party's radical wing, and Earl Ravenal as representative of
the more moderate Cato Institute-oriented wing. After Ravenal lost,
many of his supporters left the party.</p>

<p>Many states tightened ballot access laws after strong independent and
Libertarian showings in the
<a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/election/1980/">1980 presidential
election</a>. The Bergland/Lewis
ticket was on 40 ballots and won 228,314 votes. This was the first and
so far only time the Libertarian Party presidential candidate had the
third highest candidate vote total. (The party has had the third highest
party total -- excluding independents -- for most elections.)</p>

<title>It's the Spending</title>
<!-- Place: Pennsylvania (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1993? -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>It's the Spending</h1>

<p>Libertarian Party of Pennsylvania<br>
P.O. Box 4451, Allentown, PA  18105<br>
215-264-1921<br></p>

<p>The federal spending budget for FY 1993 is $1.515 trillion; which means the 
federal government spends more than four billion dollars every day
($4,151,000,000). [That's $172,958,300 per hour, $2,882,638 per minute,
$48,044 per second!]</p>

<p>President Clinton wants to increase taxes $246 billion in the next four 
years, but cut the central government's spending by a net of only
$78 billion. (Proposed spending cuts, $247 billion minus $169 billion,
proposed new spending.)</p>

<p>That's less than $20 billion a year, and $11 billion less than he plans to 
spend for a so-called 'stimulus' package during the next seven months.
$20 billion a year is within the range of statistical error in this 
sort of long-range forecasting - and represents no achievement at all.</p>

<p>He says that by 1997, the annual deficit will drop to $206 billion.</p>

<p>Let's put this into perspective:</p>

<p>A $206 billion deficit is larger than five of the deficits during the 
Reagan years (FY '81: $78.9B, '82: $127.9B, '84: $185.3B, '87: $150.4B,
& '88 $155.1B), and the first deficit during the Bush administration
('89: $152.1B).<a href="#fn1">[1]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the national debt will continue to grow.</p>

<p>Clinton's plan means higher taxes of $965 and spending cuts of $305 for 
every American.</p>

<p>Between 1981 and 1991, federal spending rose from $2,414 to $4,282 per 
person - an increase of $1,868 <a href="#fn2">[2]</a>. What took ten years to
accumulate, Clinton now says can be reduced by only one-sixth over the next
four years.</p>

<p>Democrats were firmly in control of Congress during the Reagan-Bush years.  
Clinton was elected largely by blaming Republicans for the tax, spending
and deficit increases of the past 12 years. Clinton now wants us to believe
that he and his fellow Democrats cannot undo more than one-sixth of the
damage.</p>

<p>To pay for part of his plan, Clinton wants to raise taxes on
corporations.</p>

<p>In 1991, the Fortune 500 Largest U.S. Industrial Corporations worked an 
entire year to earn profits of $55.138 billion on more than $2.2 trillion
in sales - a 2.4% profit margin. <a href="#fn3">[3]</a></p>

<p>At the federal government's current rate of spending ($4.151 billion a day),
all of the profits from the Fortune 500 companies in 1991 would last less
than two weeks (13.28 days).</p>

<p>Perhaps he wants to take more money from <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania's</a>
34 corporations on 
that Fortune 500 list - which lost a combined total of $1.6 billion in
1991.</p>

<p>Clinton also intends to raise taxes on those individuals he defines as 
"wealthy".</p>

<p><cite>Forbes</cite> magazine considers Ross Perot one of America's 400
wealthiest people, at $2.4 billion. <a href="#fn4">[4]</a></p>

<p>If the IRS could have instantly converted every penny of Ross Perot's 
wealth to cash when we got out of bed this morning, the federal government
would spend it all before most of us go to bed this evening.</p>

<p>Even the $6.3 billion that Forbes estimates Bill Gates of Microsoft is 
worth would last the federal government only one and one-half days. <a
href="#fn4">[4]</a></p>

<p>Taxing corporations will not stop the spending. Taking more from individuals
will not stop the spending. Indeed, each of the four most recent so-called
"budget summits" - all designed to cut the annual deficits - have resulted
in increased spending.</p>

<p>"Since 1929, federal expenditures (have grown) seven times as fast (as the 
gross domestic product). In 1929 private investment was five times larger
than the federal budget; in 1991 it was about half as large. Total
expenditures (by all governments) in 1929 were 12 percent of GDP; in 1991,
45 percent." <a href="#fn5">[5]</a></p>

<p>Clinton plans to deliberately increase this year's deficit some $31 billion.
Then, if everything works as he claims, the deficit in 4 years will taper off
to $206 billion a year.</p>

<p>In those four years, with much higher taxes and only minimal cuts in 
spending, the Clinton deficits will add another $1 trillion to the national
debt. That's more than the debt increased during President Reagan's first
five years in office.</p>

<p>Libertarians recognize that Clinton's proposed plan has badly placed 
priorities, grossly increases taxation, does virtually nothing to cut
spending - and will do little except leave all Americans worse off 
and more deeply in debt.  No nation has ever taxed itself into abundance 
and prosperity.</p>

<p>That's why the Libertarian Party is sponsoring the IT'S THE SPENDING! 
project.  We want every person in Pennsylvania to have a chance to suggest
ways to cut government spending.</p>

<p>For the next six weeks, until Income Tax Day, Thursday, April 15th, we want 
to get ideas from everyone. </p>

<p>By Tax Freedom Day - the day in May when every penny we earn no longer is 
taken to support the government, the day we can finally start working for
ourselves - we hope to have at least a preliminary set of suggestions to
pass along to the White House, our Senators, and our members of Congress.</p>

<p>When we're done, we'll be happy to send our list of spending cuts to 
everyone who wants one.  All suggestions should be mailed to:</p>

<p>IT'S THE SPENDING!

<h1>Libertarian Party Day</h1>

<p>The city council of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/co/Westminster.html">Westminster</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/co/">Colorado</a>,

<p>Westminster City Councilors Gary Smith and Glen Scott spearheaded the effort
to recognize the Libertarian Party's anniversary after watching

last month in Washington, DC. The official Proclamation reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WHEREAS, The Libertarian Party birthplace was in Westminster, CO 25 years
ago; and<br>
WHEREAS, A group of five young Republicans met at
<a href="/revolution/by_name/N/DavidNolan.html">David Nolan's</a> Westminster
residence and decided to start a new party on August 15, 1971; and<br>
WHEREAS, In spite of the extremely long odds against them, this group of
people attempted to offer a wider range of choices in politics; and<br>
WHEREAS, The Libertarian Party has been the greatest success story of its
kind, and<br>
WHEREAS, The Libertarian Party has grown to be America's third largest
political party; and<br>
WHEREAS; The Libertarian Party's strength and support are approximately
equal to that of all other alternative parties combined.</p>

<p>NOW, THEREFOR, The Westminster City Council does hereby proclaim August 15,
1996 as:"Libertarian Party Day" in the City of Westminster, Colorado to
acknowledge the beginning of the Libertarian Party in the City of
Westminster and recognizes the 25th anniversary of the Libertarian Party.
Signed this 12th day of August, 1996.</p>

<title>Roger MacBride</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Roger MacBride (1929 - 1995)</h1>

<p>Roger Lea MacBride was an early Libertarian celebrity. In 1972, he was an
Presidential elector for the Republican Party, but cast his electoral vote for
the <A href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a> candidates
rather than Richard Nixon. He went on to be the 1976
Libertarian presidential nominee and helped make the Libertarian Party the
nation's third largest political party. Later in life he returned to the
Republican Party and chaired the Republican Liberty Caucus.</p>

<p>MacBride was an avid reader. He met Rose Wilder Lane, daughter of Laura
Ingalls Wilder. Lane introduced him to libertarian ideas. Lane and MacBride
became close friends; he called her "Grandma" and produced the television
series based on Wilder's <cite>Little House on the Prairie</cite> books. Lane
left him her estate.</p>

<p>MacBride was elected to the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/vt/">Vermont</a> state
legislature as a Republican. He
became a Republican presidential elector for the 1972 election, and refusing to
cast his vote for Richard Nixon, instead voted for Libertarian Party candidates
<a href="/revolution/by_name/H/JohnHospers.html">John Hospers</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_name/N/TonieNathan.html">Theodora Nathan</a>.
The Libertarian Party nominated MacBride for President at their 1975
convention. MacBride's vigorous campaigning helped propel the Libertarians to
becoming the nation's third-largest political party.</p>

<p>After his death, the <cite>Libertarian Party News</cite> published <img
src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.lp.org/lp/lpn/9504-MacBride.html">"Roger MacBride"</a> in his

<h1>1978 Elections</h1>

<p>1978 was a pivotal year for the Libertarian Party. In addition to
solidifying the LP's status as third-largest political party in the U.S., the
LP elected its first officeholder and groomed a presidential candidate.</p>

<p>In 1978, 200 Libertarian candidates won a combined 1.3 million votes, more
candidates and votes than any other minor party.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/R/DickRandolph.html">Dick Randolph</a> was
elected to the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ak/">Alaska</a>
House of Representatives, where he was instrumental in
repealing Alaska's personal income tax.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/C/EdClark.html">Ed Clark</a> ran a strong
campaign for Governor of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>,
winning 378,980 votes, 5.5% of the total.
Clark would go on to become the party's 1980 presidential candidate.</p>

<body>

<h1>David Koch</h1>

<p>David Koch, one of the heirs to the Koch Industries family fortune, won the
1980 <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
nomination for Vice President. Koch's financial
contributions to the campaign helped the Libertarian Party in its
impressive third-party showing of nearly one million votes that year.</p>

<p>Koch, born in 1940, was an all-American basketball center at MIT. At the
time of the 1980 election, he was corporate president of Koch Industries Inc.,
which had $8 billion in sales in 1979.</p>

<p>David Koch's brother Charles also became active in the libertarian movement,
funding several libertarian organizations including the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/C/Cato.html">Cato Institute</a>.</p>

<title>Jury Rights</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Jury Rights</h1>

<p>The reason that we have juries decide guilt and innocence is that you can't
trust the government. Juries guard against injustice in two ways: by being
disinterested parties, and by having the authority to decide guilt or
innocence regardless of the instructions of the judge or the law. This latter
right is called jury nullification and is a well-established legal
principle.</p>

<p>The <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/FIJA.html">Fully Informed Jury
Association (FIJA)</a> seeks to inform jurors of this
right, in the hopes of having unjust laws nullified.</p>

<title>U.S. Prisons</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: report April 30, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>U.S. Prisons</h1>

<p>From an April 30, 1995 release by the U.S. Department of Justice:</p>

<p>THE NATION'S JAILS HOLD RECORD 490,442 INMATES</p>


<p>The nation's local jails held a record 490,442 men and women as of last
June 30, the Department of Justice announced today.  During the 12 months
preceding June 30, 1994, the jail population grew 6.7 percent -- less than
the 7.5 percent average annual increase for the 1983-1993 period.</p>

<p>During the last decade the nation's jail population has almost doubled
on a per capita basis.  In mid-1994 the number of jail inmates per 100,000
U.S. residents was 188--up from 96 in 1983. </p>

<p>Local jails, which are operated by counties and municipalities, housed
one-third of the almost 1.5 million people incarcerated in the U.S. in
mid-1994--the other two-thirds were in state or federal prisons.</p>

<p>The Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reported that the
reasons for the jail population increase during the last decade include a
growth in adult arrests, a rise in the number of felons sentenced to serve
time in a local jail and a growth in the number of people being held in
jails because of state or federal prison crowding.  Moreover, jail inmates
held for drug offenses grew faster than did other types of offenders.</p>

<p>As of last June, the nation's jails were operating at 97 percent
capacity despite a near doubling of the number of beds since 1983.  The
largest facilities, those with an average daily population of 500 or more
inmates, were the most crowded-- operating overall at more than 100
percent of capacity.  More than half of the nation's jail inmates were
housed in these large facilities.  The smallest facilities, with an average
of fewer than 50 inmates, were the least crowded--operating at 67 percent
of capacity.</p>

<p>Thirty-nine percent of the inmates were white non-Hispanics, 44
percent were black non-Hispanics, 15 percent were Hispanics of any race
and 2 percent were non-Hispanics of other races.  Relative to the number
of residents in the U.S. population, black non-Hispanics were more than
twice as likely as Hispanics, almost seven times more likely than white
non-Hispanics and more than nine times more likely than people of other
races to have been held in a local jail last June 30.  Among the 483,717
adult inmates there were 434,838 men and 48,879 women. </p>

<p>Approximately 6,725 people being held in jails were younger than 18
years old--about 5,100 had been convicted as adults orwere being held for
trial in adult criminal courts, and approximately 1,500 were being held as
juveniles.</p>
    
<p>Based on data collected from each of the nation's 3,300 jails, five
states held almost half of all local jail inmates-- <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> with 69,298;
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>, 55,395;
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a>, 34,183;
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/">New York</a>, 29,809 and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a>, 22,663.</p>

<p>Twenty-one states reported a jail population that more than doubled
between 1983 and 1993, with growth ranging from 103 percent in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/md/">Maryland</a>
to 264 percent in Texas.  On the other hand, in four states,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/me/">Maine</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mo/">Missouri</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ne/">Nebraska</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wy/">Wyoming</a>,
the jail inmate population grew less than 50 percent.</p>

<p>States that had the largest number of inmates per 100,000 residents were
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/la/">Louisiana</a> (377),
Georgia (328), Texas (307),
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tn/">Tennessee</a> (282),
California (222) and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nv/">Nevada</a> (215).
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ia/">Iowa</a>,
Maine and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nd/">North Dakota</a> (each
with 57 inmates per 100,000 residents);
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mn/">Minnesota</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mt/">Montana</a> (81) and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/sd/">South Dakota</a> (87)
had the smallest.</p>

<p>About 6 percent of the jail facilities housed more than half of all jail
inmates on June 30, 1993.  And last year the nation's 25 largest jail
jurisdictions accounted for 30 percent of all jail inmates.  The jurisdic-
tions were in 12 states--seven in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>,
five in Texas,
four in <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a> and
one each in <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/">New York</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/la/">Louisiana</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tn/">Tennessee</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/md/">Maryland</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a> and 
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan</a>.</p>

<p>Although not all jails were able to provide complete inmate death
data, among those that were, 647 inmates died during 1993. Of these, 290
were from natural causes or diseases other than AIDS (45 percent), 234
committed suicide (36 percent), 63 died from AIDS (10 percent) 19 were
murdered (3 percent) and 41 died of other causes (6 percent), such as
alcohol or drug overdoses (17) accidental injuries (9) and attempted
escapes (3).</p>

<p>Between 1983 and 1993, when comparable statistics were collected,
correctional staffs grew more rapidly than the inmate population--by
almost 10 percent a year, while the number of jail inmates grew by more
than 7 percent a year.  At midyear 1993, local jails employed 165,500
persons, the equivalent of about 1 employee for every 2.8 inmates.</p>

<p>For the 12 months ending June 30, 1993, local governments
throughout the U.S. spent an estimated $9.6 billion on jails, including all
operating and capital expenditures.  This total (not adjusted for inflation)
was more than triple the $2.7 billion spent in 1983.</p>

<p>Excluding capital outlays, the average cost to keep one jail inmate
incarcerated for a year was $14,667--up from $9,360 a decade ago.
Adjusted for inflation, however, the annual cost per inmate decreased by
11 percent--to $8,329 in 1983 dollars.</p>

<p>The data are from the 1993 Census of Jails and the 1994 Annual
Survey of Jails.  Every five years the census collects detailed information
about local jails, and the annual surveys provide national estimates on
fewer items.</p>

<p>Single copies of the bulletin, "Jails and Jail Inmates 1993-94"
(NCJ-151651), written by BJS statisticians Craig A. Perkins, James J.
Stephan and Allen J. Beck, may be obtained from the BJS Clearinghouse,

<title>The Foster Murder</title>
<! Place: Virginia (USA); Washington, DC (USA) -->
<! Time: death July 1993; investigation continuing March 1995 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>The Foster Murder</h1>

<p>In July 1993, Clinton aide Vince Foster was found dead in a
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/va/">Virginia</a>
park. The death was officially pronounced a suicide, but rumors abounded
that Foster was murdered. Foster's death has ties to several White House
scandals, including the administration's handling of "Travelgate," the
<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">Waco incident</a>
and the Whitewater affair.</p>

<h2>The Whitewater Connection</h2>

<p>Kenneth Starr, special counsel in charge of the Whitewater investigation,
investigated Foster's death and what relationship it might have had with
Whitewater.</p>

<p>In three articles in the <cite>Electronic Telegraph</cite>, Ambrose
Evans-Pritchard reported on the investigation and the possibility
-- or probability -- of a coverup.
In March 20, 1995's "Doubts Linger Over Clinton Aide's 'Suicide'",
Evans-Pritchard reported:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A series of US media reports has stated that Kenneth Starr, the
special counsel probing the Whitewater scandal over an unsuccessful
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ar/">Arkansas</a>
development company half-owned by Bill and Hillary Clinton, is wrapping
up his probe of Foster's death. ...  But ... if anything,he has been stepping
up his investigation. He has called 11 witnesses before a federal grand jury
in <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington</a>, and has
elicited testimony from three of them that suggests
the body was moved and that the crime scene was tampered with in a police
cover-up.</p>

<p>[Starr's] investigators are disturbed by conflicting testimony from
witnesses about Foster's state of mind before his death. Key figures have
changed their stories, raising suspicions that there may have been
an orchestrated attempt after the fact to make it look as if Foster was in
the grip of a deep depression.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Foster was suffering a degree of depression.  Lisa
Foster told investigators that he was sleeping badly and suffering from
a pounding heart. A week before his death he told his sister, Sheila
Anthony, a top Justice Department official that he wanted to talk to a
psychiatrist but needed assurances that nothing revealed in counselling
sessions could be flushed out by subpoena at a later date.</p>

<p>A psychiatrist told the FBI that he was contacted on July 16 by Anthony, who
explained that Foster was working on "Top Secret" issues at the White House and
"that his depression was directly related to highly sensitive and confidential
matters" (FBI file29D-LR-35063).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the suspicious circumstances around Foster's death is that White
House staffers removed files from Foster's office on the night of his death.
Files may have been related to the Whitewater affair, or to a NSA
project Foster was working on: PROMIS software used to track international
money flows.</p>

<p>Initial Whitewater investigator Robert Fiske issued a report ruling
Foster's death a suicide. Nine days before the Senate Banking Committee
held hearings on the death, Foster's family issued a statement endorsing the
suicide verdict: "The family believe that questions as to how and why Vince
died are now answered as best they can be.  There is now no justification for
painful, repetitious examination of these issues. The principal advocates for
doing this appear chiefly motivated by mean-spirited partisanship." </p>

<p>However, the family did not write those words. Associate Attorney-General
Sheila Anthony and her husband Beryl drafted the statement. Both are
Democratic insiders with close Clinton ties.</p>

<p>In May 1, 1995's "White House aide was murdered, say experts,"
Evans-Pritchard details further evidence supporting the theory of murder and
cover-up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vincent Foster, the deputy White House counsel, was probably murdered and
his body carried into a park as part of a staged suicide, according to a team
of independent crime-scene experts employed to investigate the death.</p>

<p>The private report is being taken extremely seriously by the official
investigation of special counsel Kenneth Starr, according to sources close to
the inquiry.</p>

<p>Foster was an intimate friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton and handled their
personal financial affairs at the White House. The US Park Police concluded
that he shot himself in the mouth on July 20, 1993. Two subsequent inquiries
endorsed the suicide verdict, but Starr has reopened the investigation and has
called witnesses for the first time before a federal grand jury.</p>

<p>At a press conference on Thursday one of the experts, retired <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York</a>
Police detective Vincent Scalice, said that in almost 30 years of police work
he could not recall "ever running across a situation where we found a body in a
case of suicide that was so neatly arranged, with the gun so conveniently
positioned in the hand in such a straight, orderly fashion".</p>

<p>The report said that the lack of blood on the front of the body was
"inconsistent" with death by a gun shot through the mouth, raising the
likelihood that Foster's heart had stopped before the gun was fired.</p>

<p>The report was commissioned by the Western Journalism Center, a <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>
group that supports investigative journalism.</p>
   
<p>The experts said that Foster was supposed to have walked 700ft through a
park, yet there was no soil or grass on his shoes. There was also no blood
splatter on the vegetation and ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In May 22, 1995's "Secret Swiss link to White House death," Evans-Pritchard
details revelations that Foster made unusual trips to Switzerland.</p>

<p>Foster flew to Switzerland November 1, 1991 (during early stages of
Bill Clinton's presidential bid), returning November 3, giving him just one
day on the ground. A year later, he did the same thing, flying to Switzerland
December 7, 1992 (during Clinton's presidential transition period) and
returning December 9. On July 1, 1993, he purchased another ticket to
Switzerland, but never went. He received a refund for the unused ticket on
July 8. He died less than two weeks later.</p>

<p>The Switzerland trips were just some of Foster's frequent flying. At the
time of his death he had acquired over 500,000 freqent flyer miles.</p>

<h2>The Waco Connection</h2>

<p>Foster's widow blames his depression on the
<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">massacre of the Branch
Davidians</a> at
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Waco.html">Waco</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>, according to
the FBI. "Lisa Foster believes that
Foster was horrified when the Branch Davidian complex burned. Foster believed
that everything was his fault," the FBI wrote of their interview with Lisa
Foster.</p>

<p>A strange form of support for that theory comes in the form of a car
burglary. The July 14, 1995 <a
href="/revolution/by_name/N/NandO.html"><cite>News and Observer</cite></a>
reported that White House lawyer Cheryl Mills had her car broken into
after preparing for a Senate hearing on Whitewater. In addition to her wallet,
the burglar stole a gym bag containing Mills' notes on the Foster affair
and on Waco.</p>

<p>During the 1995 U.S. House hearings on Waco, Texas Rangers disclosed
that when they were in dispute with the FBI about the destruction of
evidence, someone in the Texas Governor's office gave them Vince Foster's
phone number to contact. The hearings revealed that the only document
found in Foster's Waco file was a memorandum that Foster was forwarding
"Waco, the Big Lie" (a videotape charging government conspiracy) to
to the Treasury Department.</p>

<title>Telling a Jury the Possible Sentence</title>
<!-- Place: Tennessee (USA) -->
<!-- Time: September 8, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Juries and Sentences</h1>

<p>The latest victory for jury nullification came in September 1993 when
the U.S. Sixth District Court upheld a defendant's right to tell the jury what
his sentence would be if convicted.</p>

<p>As reported in the November 8, 1993 issue of <cite>Lawyers Weekly
USA</cite>, the court traced the history of jury nullification from
seventeenth-century England to the present-day United States, saying the
"Supreme Court has consistently endorsed the traditional power of the jury
to nullify a law or a specific conviction."</p>

<p>The defendant in this particular case hoped that the jury would refuse to
convict him on drug charges if they knew he "faced a minimum mandatory
sentence of 15 years, even though the amount of cocaine involved added up
to about three sugar packets' worth," said the defense lawyer, Jude Lenahan of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tn/Nashville.html">Nashville</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tn/">Tennessee</a>.</p>

<p>The judge held that "the essential purpose of the jury trial ... is to
prevent oppression by the government ...  a defendant's right to inform the
jury of that information essential to prevent oppression by the government
is clearly of constitutional magnitude. ... if community oversight of a
criminal prosecution is the primary purpose of a jury trial, then to deny a
jury information necessary to such oversight is to deny a defendant of the
full protection to be afforded by a jury trial, Indeed, to deny a defendant
the possibility of jury nullification would be to defeat the central purpose
of the jury system."</p>

<p>The Eighth, Tenth and Eleventh Circuits have held the opposite of this
conclusion, and even the Sixth Circuit may not uphold the decision in
future cases.</p>

<p><cite>Lawyers Weekly</cite> provided background for those interested:
"The circuit rulings that have rejected the holding in this case are
<cite>U.S.  v. Goodface</cite>, 835 F.2d 1233 (8th Cir. 1987); <cite>U.S. v. 
McDonald</cite>, 933 F.2d 1519 (10th Cir. 1991); and <cite>U.S. v. Cox</cite>,
696 F.2d 1294 (11th Cir. 1983).</p>

Datcher</cite>, No. 3:92-00054.  September 8, 1993.  <cite>Lawyers
Weekly</cite>  USA No. 9901621 (10 pages).  To orders a copy of the opinion,

<title>FIJA Activist Arrested</title>
<!-- Place: Reno, Nevada (USA) -->
<!-- Time: March 15, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>FIJA Activist Arrested</h1>

<p>March 1995, from <A href="/revolution/by_name/D/LarryDodge.html">Larry
Dodge</a>, co-founder and Board Chairman, <a
href="/revolution/by_name/F/FIJA.html">Fully Informed Jury Association</a>:</p>

<p>On March 15, wholesale florist Yvonne Regas of Sparks,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nv/">Nevada</a> will be 
arraigned in U.S. District Court in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nv/Reno.html">Reno</a>,
on charges of (1) Conspiracy 
to Obstruct Justice; (2) Aiding and Abetting Obstruction of Justice; and
(3) Jury Tampering.</p>

<p> Before deciding that such dastardly behavior deserves swift, 
sure punishment --- such as the three to six years in prison this could 
cost Ms. Regas, if convicted --- consider what she actually did: she and
a few friends put brochures published by the Fully Informed Jury 
Association (FIJA) under the wiper blades of cars parked near the 
courthouse, during the trial of her son and ex-husband, among others, on
drug charges.  That's it.</p>

<p> These brochures, which have been distributed similarly by untold
numbers of people at hundreds of courthouses around the country over the
past five years, explain the rights, powers, and responsibilities of 
trial jurors.  Often, they're handed to all who enter the courthouse by 
activists standing outside the doorways.</p>

<p> This is the latest --- and because federal, the most serious ---
in a series of harassments aimed at stopping FIJA activists from 
leafleting.  In four previous cases, confrontations resulting in felony 
jury tampering charges took place in front of state courthouses.  Two 
resultant prosecutions have been won by the defendants; two more are 
still pending.</p>

<p> These actions represent a serious and patterned escalation by 
the government over earlier reactions, which usually entailed, at worst,
shooing FIJA leafleters off the porch of the building and onto the 
sidewalks.  After relocating there, and relying on <cite>US v. Grace</cite>,
1983 (in which the Supreme Court declared the sidewalks around a courthouse 
to be a "traditional free speech zone") the leafleters would continue 
leafleting, undisturbed.</p>

<p> The point of the leafleting has been to advise jurors that they 
have the power to judge the law itself, and not just "the facts," as 
most modern jury instructions insist.  Known in the legal community as 
the doctrine of "jury nullification of law" or simply "jury veto power,"
it means that "the governed" --- if they only know about their power as 
jurors --- can "just say no" to bad law, and thereby check and balance 
the government.</p>

<p> FIJA activists are thus betting that ordinary Americans, armed 
with this knowledge, will begin refusing to apply many of this country's
most oppressive laws.  It was rejection of bad laws by juries which made
us free in the first place, FIJA activists can document, and it may be 
the only way out from under an increasingly tyrannical government again 
today: a series of jury rejections of a given law has in the past led 
the government to change or abolish that law, as happened to fugitive 
slave acts, Prohibition, and anti-strike laws.</p>

<p> The Regas case may indeed be the result of successes that FIJA 
activists have had in educating jurors at a number of recent federal 
cases, including the Branch Davidians' trial on gun and conspiracy 
charges in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/SanAntonio.html">San
Antonio</a>, the trial of vitamin salesman Roger Sless for 
selling "unapproved nutritional supplements" in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nm/Albuquerque.html">Albuquerque</a>,
some drug trials and --- perhaps most importantly --- several unsuccessful 
prosecutions of tax resisters.</p>

<p> The Regas case has attracted some of the nation's premier 
constitutional lawyers: <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/NancyLord.html">Nancy
Lord</a>, Larry Becraft, and (possibly) 
Jonathan Emord.  They see this as a watershed case for both the First 
and Sixth Amendments, and believe that conviction of Ms. Regas could 
result in erosion of the rest of the Bill of Rights.  On the other hand,
dismissal of charges or, especially, an acquittal by jury of Ms. Regas 
would measurably improve the future of justice by jury, and thus the 
future of all other individual rights.</p>

<p> If Regas is convicted, Nancy Lord fears it could also lead to 
prosecutions of FIJA activists around the country, simply for using 
their right of free speech to inform jurors of their right to vote on a 
verdict according to conscience and common sense, whenever strict 
application of the law would, in their eyes, produce an injustice. 
Acquittal, however, would likely protect jury-rights educators and 
activists from further abuse by the government --- until they're put out
of work by enactment of "FIJA legislation," laws which will either 
require judges or fellow attorneys, for the first time in a century, to 
resume the practice of informing juries about their veto power.</p>

<p> I'm therefore asking anyone reading this message to help with 
the legal defense fund for Yvonne Regas.  Or, let me put it this way: 
"The OK Corral has moved to Reno.  If you want to outgun Raw Tyranny, 
let your wallet do the talking!"  This translates into a plea to send 
whatever you can afford (the minimum needed if the case goes to trial is
$20,000) to LAWYERS FOR LIBERTY, c/o <a

<title>FBI Evidence Tampering</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: September 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>FBI Investigated for Evidence Tampering</h1>

<p>In September 1995, the Justice Department began an investigation into
allegations by an FBI scientist that the FBI crime laboratory tampered with
evidence to favor the prosecution in high-profile cases.</p>

<p>FBI Special Agent Frederic Whitehurst alleged that the FBI crime lab
tampered with evidence and did not report evidence favorable to the
defense. Whitehurst accused FBI agent Roger Martz, who testified in the
O.J. Simpson murder trial, of slanting evidence in testimony in other
cases. Whitehurst also testified in the Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman terrorism
trial that he was pressured to distort findings about the 1993 <a
href="/revolution/multi/war/wtc.html">World Trade Center bombing</a>
 to favor prosecutors (but did not do so).</p>

<p>The FBI, unsurprisingly, said its own review of 250 cases found no
manipulation of evidence. Whitehurst called the review "garbage."
Whitehurst, formerly the FBI's main explosives-residue analyst, has
been demoted to paint analyst.</p>

<p>As Whitehurst put it, "I swore to uphold the constitution of the United
States, and I swore to enforce the law. There was no caveat in that
swearing -- if I caught persons with badges I would turn my back."</p>

<title>Broadcasters Accompanying Searches</title>
<!-- Place: New York (USA) -->
<!-- Time: search March 5, 1992; court decision 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Search Warrants Don't Allow Spectators</h1>

<p>Paul Wright, the imprisoned editor of <cite>Prison Legal News</cite>, sent
this. <cite>PLN</cite> is available from P.O. Box 1684, Lake Worth, FL 33460.
$12 for subscriptions and $1 for a sample copy.</p>

<p>In a landmark decision a federal court in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/">New York</a> has ruled
that a CBS film crew and Secret Service agents are liable for filming and
broadcasting a search of a private citizen's home. It is the first reported
court decision to hold a television broadcaster liable for accompanying
police agents on a search and filming it for the broadcast. Anyone who
has watched "Cops," "Hard Copy," "America's Most Wanted," or any
of the "real life" cop shows has seen the degrading and propagandistic
manner in which the victims of police repression are portrayed. The
broadcasters and the police can be sued and held liable for such actions.</p>

<p> In 1992 Secret Service agents obtained a search warrant
from a federal court authorizing the search of an apartment shared by
Babatunde Ayeni, his wife Tawa, and small son Kayode, seeking
evidence of a credit card fraud operation. At 6PM on March 5, 1992,
several Secret Service (SS) agents forced their way into the Ayeni
residence announcing they had a warrant to conduct a search and
ask questions. Only Mrs. Ayeni and her son were home at the time. At
about 8:15 four more SS agents arrived with a film crew from the CBS
news program "Street Stories." The CBS film crew was never identified
as CBS employees. The CBS crew followed the SS agents and taped
them as they searched the apartment. They took closeup shots of the
home's interior, its closets, personal letters, family photos, etc. In the
apartment's foyer an SS agent was interviewed about the modus
operandi of people who commit credit card frauds and the tools of
their trade. During this tape sequence the SS agent implied the
complicity of the other residents of the Ayeni apartment. No
evidence implicating the Ayenis in any illegal activity was found
during the search. One of the agents was filmed expressing his
disappointment.</p>

<p> The Ayenis filed suit against the federal agents as well as CBS,
contending that the search and its filming violated their fourth
amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. In his
opinion Judge Weinstein agreed with the Ayenis. The defendants sought
qualified immunity, which the court denied.</p>

<p> Under the doctrine of qualified immunity government agents are
entitled to be free from liability for money damages even if they violate
constitutional rights as long as the right is not "well established" so that
a person of reasonable intelligence would know that the right violated
was recognized. In the case the court held that any reasonable police
agent would have known that it is unconstitutional to have private
citizens accompany them on a search to film and broadcast the search.
The court relied on 18 U.S.C. sec. 3105 which requires that search
warrants be served by an official authorized to serve the warrant and
by no other person unless their assistance is required in conducting the
search, i.e. an accountant, forensic expert, etc., depending on the
nature of the offense being investigated. Thus, the SS agents should
have known that having a film crew taping their activities was illegal.
Courts have previously held that taking photos is a "seizure" within
the meaning of the fourth amendment. CBS also claimed qualified
immunity from suit. The court notes that private entities are not
entitled to qualified immunity from suit, it only applies to government
actors.</p>

<p> The court used harsh language in condemning the actions by
the SS and CBS. "The search warrant was issued to agent Mottola and
other agents of the Unites States Secret Service for precise and limited
purposes. It authorized their entry into the Ayenis' home only to search
for items related to credit card fraud. Agent Mottola's act of facilitating
the CBS camera crew's entry into the apartment and its filming of the
search exceeded the scope of the warrant. It was allegedly in clear
violation then well [sic] established fourth amendment principles.
...it is the equivalent of a rogue policeman using his official position
to break into a home in order to steal objects for his own profit or
that of another."</p>

<p> For immunity purposes it would be "...grossly unreasonable
for a government agent not to have known that the presence of
private persons he invited in so that they could titillate and entertain
others was beyond the scope of what was lawfully authorized by
the warrant.</p>

<p> "CBS had no greater right than that of a thief to be in the
home, to 'capture' the scene of the search on film and to remove
the photographic record. The images, though created by the camera,
are a part of the household; they could not be removed without
permission or official right....The television tape was a seizure of
private property, information, for non-governmental purposes."</p>

<p> It is entirely possible that litigation by the victims of this type
of police and media activity may be able to halt the spread of
"police TV." Findings of liability against both police and the broadcaster
will see to it that police activity is not broadcast to "entertain and
titillate." So if you've been filmed against your will during a police
search you too can sue for an invasion of your privacy and your
fourth amendment rights. The court decision is reported at:
<cite>Ayeni v. CBS, Inc.</cite>, 848 F. Supp 362 (ED NY 1994).</p>

<h1>The Terror Law of 1996</h1>

<p>The Effective Death Penalty and Anti-Terrorism Act of 1996 gives
extensive new authority to federal law enforcement agencies, bring
the US ever closer to a police state. Ironically, the
<a href="/revolution/multi/war/wtc.html">World Trade Center
bombing</a> engineered by the FBI was the initial impetus behind
the bill. The Alfred Murrah Federal Building bombing in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a> created
bipartisan support for the bill at a time when it was being stalled by civil
liberties advocates. Activists managed to hold the bill off for another
year, but it was finally passed in April 1996.</p>

<p>S. 390 was introduced February 10, 1995 by Sen. Joe Biden
(D-<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/de/">Delaware</a>)
and Sen. Arlen Specter
(R-<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania</a>).
H.R. 896 was introduced the same day in the House by
Rep. Charles Schumer
(D-<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/">New York</a>) and
Rep. Dicks.</p>

<p>The bill passed the Senate in June 1995, but was held up in the House
by intense lobbying by what was called "an unusual coalition" of
gun rights groups and civil liberties organizations. Such
coalitions are unusual to someone stuck in the traditional
right-left frame of mind, who does not yet realize that people can
be committed to all individual rights instead of a select few.</p>

<p>The bill finally passed the House in March 1996, and was signed
into law in April 1996.</p>

<h2>The Law</h2>

<p>The Center for National Security Studies (CNSS) issued an excellent
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.cdt.org/policy/terrorism/cnss.cti.anal.html">analysis of the
bill</a>,
along with information on the <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.cdt.org/policy/terrorism/cnss.FBI.auth.html">FBI</a> and
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.cdt.org/policy/terrorism/cnss.trends.html">trends</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NCARL.html">National Coalition Against
Repressive Legislation</a> (NCARL) summarized the bill in 1995 and
the law as finally passed in 1996. NCARL and others raised important
criticisms:</p>
<dl>
<p>
<dt>Presumed guilty, secret evidence can be used</dt>
<dd>Permanent resident aliens arrested under this law have to prove they
should not be held in jail before trial. Secret evidence can used in the
detention hearings and at trial that only the judge could see, not the
defendant.</dd>
<p>
<dt>First Amendment protections weakened.</dt>
<dd>The law lifts a 1994 Crime law restriction prohibiting the FBI from
investigations based on speech or beliefs, when restricting humanitarian aid.
Foreigners can be barred from speaking in the U.S. using McCarthy era
McCarran-Walter Act provisions. An overbroad definition of terrorism
virtually requires the Justice Department to select crimes to prosecute
based on political beliefs and associations.</dd>
<p>
<dt>Presidential powers expanded.</dt>
<dd>The President can label organizations -- without any appeal or review --
as "terrorist", and criminalize fundraising for humanitarian aid even
remotely related to such groups.</dd>
<p>
<dt>Punishment for lawful actions.</dt>
<dd>Permanent resident aliens can be deported or indefinitely jailed for their
affiliations or political activity, with no judicial review.</dd>
<p>
<dt>Constitutional protections eroded.</dt>
<dd>The law further restricts the Bill of Rights' habeas corpus protections
for state prisoners. Although this is a terrorism law, and death-row inmates
were used to justify this provision, this affects all state prisoners,
and no one convicted of federal terrorism laws. Prisoners are required
to prove the state acted "unreasonably," a tough legal standard that
isn't met simply by having credible evidence of innocence or wrongful
imprisonment. Prisoners will be limited to one federal appeal within a
short time of exhausting state appeals. Federal courts are required to
render decisions within six months, and can't overrule state courts'
interpretations of constitutional law.</dd>
<p>
<dt>More spending (meaning higher taxes and debt), and more police abuses.</dt>
<dd>The law authorizes $1 billion in new federal spending
over five years. The amount includes an additional $100 million for
one of the most terroristic organizations in the United States,
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.</dd>
<p>
<dt>Further restrictions on financial privacy.</dt>
<dd>The law requires banks to identify any domestic "agents" (undefined) of
groups labeled as terrorist, and freeze their funds with no right
of appeal.</dd>
</dl> 

<p>The original bill contained a provision, supported by the Clinton
administration, lifting the historical "Posse Comitatus" restriction
on the U.S. military working with domestic police. The provision did
not make it into the final version.</p>

<p>The law creates an oversight commission for federal police agencies.
Even though the commission has no subpoena power and can only make
recommendations, FBI Director
<a href="/revolution/by_name/F/LouisFreeh.html">Louis Freeh</a>
lobbied against the bill based on this one provision.</p>

<h2>The Critics</h2>

<p>On April 24, 1995, the <a href="/revolution/by_name/A/ACLU.html">
American Civil Liberties Union</a> issued a press
release quoting their Executive Director Ira Glasser,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In past times of tragedy and fear, the government has harassed, 
investigated and arrested innocent people solely because of their race, 
religion, national origin, speech or political beliefs.  In the 1920 
Palmer raids, thousands were improperly arrested and jailed in 33 cities 
as a response to a frightening wave of bombings.  People were summarily 
deported based on their national origin and their political association.  
During World War II, the federal government committed what is now 
universally seen as an act of racism and war hysteria when it incarcerated 
Japanese-American citizens.  In the 1950s, legitimate fears of Soviet 
threats were used to convert dissent into disloyalty.  People were spied 
upon and punished on the basis of political beliefs and associations 
instead of criminal evidence.  In the turbulent 1960s, the government 
again engaged in widespread infiltration and surveillance of organizations 
opposed to the Vietnam war and those trying to win equality for 
African-Americans.  Again, normal standards of criminal evidence were 
abandoned; instead, race and political beliefs became a cause for 
suspicion.  </p>
 
<p> We must now try to avoid that same mistake.  The government should 
certainly investigate vigorously based on criminal evidence.  But no one 
should be targeted because they believe in the Second Amendment, or belong 
to far right organizations. No matter how much we may disagree with some of
those organizations, we must not target people associated with them in the
absence of credible evidence of criminal conduct.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/M/VinceMiller.html">Vince Miller</a>,
Director of the <a href="/revolution/by_name/I/ISIL.html">International
Society for Individual Liberty</a>, said the
following in an April 26, 1995 message to LiberNet:</p>

<blockquote>
</p>The "Counter-Terrorism Bill" however, concentrates enormous police powers
in a domestic equivalent of the National Security Council, and gives the
President
tremendous arbitrary power to declare who is a domestic or overseas "terrorist"
-- a decision which this legislation says shall not be subject to appeal!  The
bill authorizes secret trials for citizens and immigrants who are merely
accused of lending support (including humanitarian aid) to domestic or
international "terrorist" organizations, and these accusations may be made by
anonymous informants.</p>

<p>The bill says that individuals arrested under this act may be declared
ineligible for bail, may be detained indefinitely until trial, and will be
considered guilty until proven innocent -- the direct opposite of American
principles of justice that have protected the freedom of innocent people for
over two hundred years.</p>

<p>If the individual cannot somehow prove his or her innocence, than he will be
summarily deported if a "green-card" resident, or put in jail for up to 10
years if a citizen -- while still not necessarily having been proven guilty of
any real crime.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that if the President has arbitrary standards for
declaring individuals or groups "terrorist", standards and targets can change
according to short-term political goals.  Syria was a "terrorist state" until
George Bush needed them to help fight Iraq.  Iran has been an alternate ally
and enemy, as has Iraq, some Afghan groups, the ANC and numerous others.  How
is one to know what aid is legal and what may be suddenly not?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a> issued
a press release April 27, 1995, on the relationship between the Oklahoma City
bombing and the Counterterrorism Bill, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Law-enforcement agencies should act swiftly to bring the criminals who
committed this heinous act to justice, and to punish them to the fullest 
extent of the law," said <a
href="/revolution/by_name/D/SteveDasbach.html">Steve Dasbach</a>, Chair of
America's third largest 
political party. "However, we must not dishonor the men, women, and children 
who died in that brutal and senseless act by linking their tragedy to any 
effort to undermine fundamental American liberties.</p>

<p>"The freedoms recognized under the Bill of Rights are our strongest  bulwark
against terrorism," asserted Dasbach. "Security measures that infringe on those
freedoms will inevitably lead to abuse, ultimately making us less secure in our
lives and property."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Under Clinton's proposal, the FBI would have the power to examine financial,
travel, and telephone records, conduct wiretapping, and infiltrate "suspect"
groups. Clinton said such powers were needed to protect "our way of life."</p>

<p>"An abiding respect for liberty is our way of life," countered Dasbach.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Libertarian Party issued another news release on April 18, 1996,
unsuccesfully urging the President to veto the bill:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You don't honor the memory of the dead by depriving the living of 
their basic freedoms," said the party's National Chair Steve Dasbach. "And you
don't protect Americans from hypothetical foreign terrorists by giving more 
power to government agencies with a history of running roughshod over our 
civil liberties."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"The fact that Clinton and Congress are trying to link this bill to 
the Oklahoma City tragedy is political ghoulishness as its worst," said 
Dasbach. "It shows that there is no tragedy that politicians won't try to 
capitalize on to further increase the power of government."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Richard Hartman of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/Spokane.html">Spokane</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a>, reported
hearing the following
exchange on the radio between a reporter and Attorney General Janet Reno:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>REPORTER:</b> If the FBI had already possessed the powers described in 
President Clinton's anti-terrorism legislation, would you have been able  to
prevent the Oklahoma disaster?</p>

<p><b>RENO:</b> No.</p>

</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>The Supporters</h2>

<p>U.S. voters should take note that once again, Republicans and Democrats
united to take away your rights. Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich both
supported the bill, as did President Clinton.
The <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
was the only political party to publicly oppose the passage of the law.</p>

<h1>California ID Cards</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/C/JeffChan.html">Jeff Chan</a>:</p>

<p>Saw on the TV news last night that the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> state
supreme court
has ruled that you can be arrested for not carrying ID.  That's
right, if you can't produce an ID the police in California now 
have the discretion to arrest you on the spot.  The news people 
described this as based on an interpretation of the Vehicle Code.</p>

<p>According to the report, this new ruling applies even if you're 
<em>not</em> driving.  In theory if you went jogging without your wallet 
and were stopped for jaywalking, not being able to produce ID 
could land you in jail.  The story I saw was on KTVU Channel 2.</p>

<p>According to the TV report California is the only state with this rule 
and some civil rights lawyers said they would take it to Federal
Supreme Court.  Note that this makes us the same as present day 
Germany (and probably other countries too).  (Someone else cited 
South Africa's pass law.)</p>

<h1>Police Can't Require ID</h1>

<p>From Schirado (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:schirado@lab.cc.wmich.edu">schirado@lab.cc.wmich.edu</a>):</p>

<p>In response to Jeff Chan's horror about the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>
Supreme Court's recent idiocy regarding identification, I offer the
following <em>federal</em> Supreme Court case. Federal beats State every time,
when the subject matter is the derogation of rights secured by the
Constitution.</p>

<p><cite>Brown v. Texas</cite>,443 U.S. 47 (1979): "Two police officers, while 
cruising near noon in a patrol car, observed appellant and another man
walking away from one another in an alley in an area that had a high 
incidence of drug traffic.  They stopped and asked appellant to 
identify himself and explain what he was doing.  One officer testified
that he stopped appellant because the situation 'looked suspicious and
we had never seen that subject in that area before.'  The officers did
not claim to suspect appellant of any specific misconduct, nor did 
they have any reason to believe that he was armed.  When appellant 
refused to identify himself, he was arrested for violation of a <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>
statute which makes it a criminal act for a person to refuse to give 
his name and address to an officer 'who has lawfully stopped him and 
requested the information.'  Appellant's motion to set aside
information charging him with violation of the statute on the ground 
that the statute violated the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth 
amendments was denied, and he was convicted and fined."</p>

<p>"HELD: The application of the Texas statute to detain appellant and 
require him to identify himself violated the Fourth Amendment because 
the officers lacked any reasonable suspicion to believe that appellant
was engaged or had engaged in criminal conduct.  Detaining appellant 
to require him to identify himself constituted a seizure of his person
subject to the requirement of the Fourth Amendment that the seizure be
'reasonable.' Cf. <cite>Terry v. Ohio</cite>, 392 U.S. 1; ... <cite>Delaware v.
Prouse</cite>, 440 U.S. 648.  Here, the state does not contend that appellant
was stopped pursuant to a practice embodying neutral criteria, and the
officer's actions were not justified on the ground that they had a reasonable 
suspicion, based on objective facts, that he was involved in criminal 
activity.  Absent any basis for suspecting appellant of misconduct, 
the balance between the public interest in crime prevention and 
appellant's right to personal security and privacy tilts in favor of 
freedom from police interference.</p>

<p>Pp. 50-53. - Mr. Chief Justice Burger delivered the opinion of the court. -
"This appeal presents the question whether appellant was validly convicted for
refusing to comply with a policeman's demand that he identify himself pursuant
to 
a provision of the Texas Penal Code which makes it a crime to refuse 
such identification on request." - "Appellant refused to identify 
himself and angrily asserted that the officers had no right to stop 
him." - "The Fourth Amendment, of course, 'applies to all seizures of 
the person, including seizures that involve only a brief detention 
short of traditional arrest. <cite>Davis v. Mississippi</cite>, 394 U.S. 721
(1969); <cite>Terry v. Ohio</cite>, 392 U.S. 1, 16-19 (1968).  '[W]henever a
police officer accosts an individual and restrains his freedom to walk away, 
he has 'seized' that person...and the fourth Amendment requires that 
the seizure be 'reasonable' <cite>U.S. v. Brignoni-Ponce</cite>, 422 U.S. 873,
878 (1975)" - "We need not decide whether an individual may be punished 
for refusing to identify himself in the context of a lawful 
investigatory stop which satisfies Fourth Amendment requirements. See 
<cite>Dunaway v. New York</cite>, 442 U.S. 200,210 n.12 (1979); <cite>Terry v.
Ohio</cite> ... the county judge who convicted appellant was troubled by this
question, as shown by the colloquy set out in the appendix to this opinion." - 
"Accordingly, appellant may not be punished for refusing to identify 
himself, and the conviction is Reversed."</p>

<h2>"APPENDIX TO THE OPINION OF THE COURT</h2>

<p>"THE COURT:...What do you think about if you stop a person lawfully, 
and then if he doesn't want to talk to you, you put him in jail for 
committing a crime?"</p>

<p>"MR. PATTON [prosecutor]: Well first of all, I would question the 
defendant's statement in his motion that the first amendment gives an 
individual the right to silence."</p>

<p>"THE COURT:...I'm asking you why should the State put you in jail 
because you don't want to say anything?"</p>

<p>"MR. PATTON: Well, I think there's certain interests that have to be 
viewed."</p>

<p>"THE COURT: Okay, I'd like you to tell me what those are."</p>

<p>"MR. PATTON: Well, the Governmental interest to maintain the safety 
and security of the society and the citizens to live in the society, 
and there are certainly strong Governmental interests in that 
direction and because of that, these interests outweigh the interests 
of an individual for a certain amount of intrusion upon his personal 
liberty.  I think these Governmental interests outweigh the 
individual's interests in this respect, as far as simply asking an 
individual for his name and address under the proper circumstances."</p>

<p>"THE COURT: But why should it be a crime to not answer?"</p>

<p>"MR. PATTON: Again, I can only contend that if an answer is not given,
it tends to disrupt."</p>

<p>"THE COURT: What does it disrupt?"</p>

<p>"MR. PATTON: I think it tends to disrupt the goal of this society to 
maintain security over its citizens to make sure they are secure in 
their gains and their homes."</p>

<p>"THE COURT: How does that secure anybody by forcing them, under 
penalty of being prosecuted, to giving their name and address, even 
though they are lawfully stopped?"</p>

<p>"MR. PATTON: Well I, you know, under the circumstances in which some 
individuals would be lawfully stopped, it's presumed that perhaps this
individual is up to something, and the officer is doing his duty 
simply to find out the individual's name and address, and to determine
exactly what is going on."</p>

<p>"THE COURT: I'm not questioning, I'm not asking whether the officer 
shouldn't ask questions. I'm sure they should ask everything they 
possibly could find out.  What I'm asking is what's the State's 
interest in putting a man in jail because he doesn't want to answer 
something.  I realize lots of times an officer will give a defendant a
Miranda warning which means a defendant doesn't have to make a 
statement.  Lots of defendants go ahead and confess, which is fine if 
they want to do that.  But if they don't confess, you can't put them 
in jail, can you, for refusing to confess to a crime?"</p>

<title>Health Care ID Card</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: report 1993 or 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Clinton Proposes National Health Care ID Card</h1>

<p>Reuter news service reported on August 14, 1994 (or was it 1993?) that
Bill Clinton's administration "is studying the feasibility of creating
a tamper-proof national identity card aimed in part at preventing illegal
immigrants from using government benefit programs."</p>

<p>Clinton told the <cite>Los Angeles Times</cite> the idea "ought to
be examined" and is being considered by Hillary Clinton's health care task
force. Clinton did say he opposed <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> Governor
Pete Wilson's
proposals to deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants
and deny emergency medical treatment to undocumented residents.</p>

<p>In further evidence of Clinton's internal contradictions, Clinton
acknowledged that "a lot of immigration groups and advocates have said that
any kind of identification card like that sort of smacks of Big
Brotherism."</p>

<p>Clinton always seems to get the arguments right, then say
"but ..." and contradict his argument. I suspect he internally realizes
totalitarianism is wrong but can't stand up to Hillary and other outside
pressures.</p>

<title>U.S. Card</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->

<h1>The U.S. Card Proposal</h1>

<p>The May 1994 <cite>Digital Media: A Seybold Report</cite>
(<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:dmedia@netcom.com">dmedia@netcom.com</a>) reported on
a Clinton administration plan to create a national identity card.</p>

<p>Mitch Ratcliffe (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:godsdog@netcom.com">godsdog@netcom.com</a>), Editor in Chief,
reported that several government agencies revealed their plans at
the April 1994 CardTech/SecureTech Conference, held to discuss "smart card"
and PCMCIA card applications for business and government.</p>

<p>The Postal Service presented a proposal for a "general purpose U.S.
services smartcard," which Ratcliffe said "individuals and companies would
use to authenticate their identities when sending and receiving electronic
mail, transferring funds and interacting with government agencies, such as
the I.R.S., Veterans Administration and the Department of Health and Human
Services."</p>

<p>Other government entities, including Hillary Clinton's health care task
force and the I.R.S, are considering national identity cards. The Postal
Service is trying to convince the federal government to use a single card
approach. The Postal Service project was actually initiated by the Department
of Defense, with consulting along the way from the National Security Agency.</p>

<p>The Postal Service's "U.S. Card" could be used as an electronic
authentication method for secure transactions. Coincidentally, and especially
combined with the Clipper Chip proposal, this would give the federal
government access to a huge amount of information about individuals and
companies that use the card.</p>

<title>Greek ID Cards</title>
<!-- Place: Greece -->
<!-- Time: 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Greek National ID Cards</h1>

<p>Sir Sigmund Sternberg of the Sternberg Centre for Judaism wrote the
following letter published in the April 28, 1995 London <cite>Times</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sir, I agree with Mr Christopher Jackson (letter, April 25)  that there is a
need for a rational view on identity cards. It may well be worthwhile, as he
says, to examine the way in which the Danes have dealt with the matter.</p>

<p>By coincidence, the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/Greece/">Greeks</a> are involved in a
similar discussion - not whether to issue ID cards, but whether it is right
for such cards to include religion.</p>

<p>The small Greek Jewish community totals 5,000.  In 1941, 65,000 Jews, 85 per
cent of the Greek Jewish population, were deported to concentration camps by
the Nazis.  Few returned.  For fairly obvious reasons, Greek Jews oppose the
inclusion of religion on ID cards.   In the past, such identification has made
it easier for them to be singled out for discrimination and worse.</p>

<p>Leaders of the Greek Orthodox Church, with whom I had discussions during a
recent short visit, did not seem to understand the  problem. There is little
anti-Semitism or racism in Greece and Greek Orthodox leaders are receptive to
the idea of more contact between the faiths, as indeed are others. A recent
revision of textbooks has been widely welcomed as an important first step.</p>

<p>My visit to Greece strengthened my views that inter-religious dialogue is of
growing importance in our troubled world.  Much more than ID cards is at
stake.</p>

<title>Courtroom Bloopers</title>

<body>

<h1>Courtroom Bloopers</h1>

<p>All of us make mistakes. But when lawyers and people testifying make
mistakes, they get recorded by the court reporter. Mary Louise Gilman, editor
of <cite>National Shorthand Reporter</cite>, collected courtroom bloopers in
two books, <cite>Humor in the Court</cite> (1977) and <cite>More Humor in the
Court</cite> (1994). Following are a few samples from those books.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  What is your brother-in-law's name?</p>

<p>A.  Borofkin.</p>

<p>Q.  What's his first name?</p>

<p>A.  I can't remember.</p>

<p>Q.  He's been your brother-in-law for years, and you can't remember his
first name?</p>

<p>A.  No.  I tell you I'm too excited. (Rising from the witness chair and
pointing to Mr. Borofkin.) Nathan, for God's sake, tell them your first
name!</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Did you ever stay all night with this man in New York?</p>

<p>A.  No, I'm divorced.</p>

<p>Q.  And what did your husband do before you divorced him?</p>

<p>A.  A lot of things I didn't know about.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Doctor, how many autopsies have you peformed on dead people?</p>

<p>A.  All my autopsies have been performed on dead people.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Were you aquainted with the deceased?</p>

<p>A.  Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Q.  Before or after he died?</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Mrs. Jones, is your appearance this morning pursuant to a deposition
notice which I sent to your attorney?</p>

<p>A.  No.  This is how I dress when I go to work.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Did he pick the dog up by the ears?</p>

<p>A.  No.</p>

<p>Q.  What was he doing with the dog's ears?</p>

<p>A.  Picking them up in the air.</p>

<p>Q.  Where was the dog at this time?</p>

<p>A.  Attached to the ears.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  When he went, had you gone and had she, if she wanted to and were able,
for the time being excluding all the restraints on her not to go, gone also,
would he have brought you, meaning you and she, with him to the station?</p>

<p>MR. BROOKS: Objection.  That question should be taken out and shot.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Now, you have investigated other murders, have you not, where there was
a victim?</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  ... and what did he do then?</p>

<p>A.  He came home, and next morning he was dead.</p>

<p>Q.  So when he woke up the next morning he was dead?</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Did you tell your lawyer that your husband had offered you
indignities?</p>

<p>A.  He didn't offer me nothing; he just said I could have the furniture.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  So, after the anesthesia, when you came out of it, what did you observe
with respect to your scalp?</p>

<p>A.  I didn't see my scalp the whole time I was in the hospital.</p>

<p>Q.  It was covered?</p>

<p>A.  Yes, bandaged.</p>

<p>Q.  Then, later on ... what did you see?</p>

<p>A.  I had a skin graft. My whole buttocks and leg were removed and put on
top of my head.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Could you see him from where you were standing?</p>

<p>A.  I could see his head.</p>

<p>Q.  And where was his head?</p>

<p>A.  Just above his shoulders.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Do you drink when you're on duty?</p>

<p>A.  I don't drink when I'm on duty, unless I come on duty drunk.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Are you sexually active?</p>

<p>A.  No, I just lie there.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Are you qualified to give a urine sample?</p>

<p>A.  Yes, I have been since early childhood.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  The truth of the matter is that you were not an unbiased, objective
witness, isn't it. You too were shot in the fracas?</p>

<p>A.  No, sir. I was shot midway between the fracas and the navel.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  What is the meaning of sperm being present?</p>

<p>A.  It indicates intercourse.</p>

<p>Q.  Male sperm?</p>

<p>A.  That is the only kind I know.</p>

<h1>Lawyer Jokes</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Difference Between Catfish and Lawyers</h2>

<p>The difference between a catfish and a lawyer is that one is a
scumsucking bottom feeder, and the other is just a fish.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Lawyers and Lab Rats</h2>

<p>Scientists are considering using lawyers in place of rats in lab
experiments. Researchers get less attached to them and there are some
things rats just won't do.</p>

<hr>

<h2>That's Not Funny</h2>

<P>The problem with lawyer jokes is that lawyers don't think
they're funny, and no one else thinks they're jokes.</p>

<title>FDA Vitamin Store Raids</title>
<!-- Place: first raid Livonia, Michigan (USA);
	second raid Chula Vista, California (USA) -->
<!-- Time: May 12, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>FDA Vitamin Store Raids</h1>

<p>May 1993, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/VinceMiller.html">Vince
Miller</a>:</p>

<p>As if our sensibilities haven't been bludgeoned into a state of abject 
numbness by the obscene excesses of BATF, FBI and sundry other statist 
agencies lately, here are more nazi police-state actions by the FDA -- this 
time against the deadly menace of health food/vitamin stores. (data from a 
fax from Citizens for Health).</p>

<p>The FDA in coordination with the IRS, DEA, U.S. Customs, and local police 
conducted 37 raids in the U.S. (May 12th).  More than 100 so-called "drugs" 
were the subject of 23 armed commando-style assaults.  Among the vitamin 
supplements seized were laetrile, coenzyme-Q10 tablets, an adrenal cortex 
spray, etc.</p>

<p>The first raid occurred in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/Livonia.html">Livonia</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan</a>. Between 6
and 8 FDA agents 
burst into Zerbo's Health Food store at 11:00 am seizing projects not 
approved by the FDA.  Agents were quoted as saying "If you do not cooperate 
we will confiscate all your store's products."  Customers were told to 
leave the store.  U.S. Customs agents were on hand claiming that Zerbos was 
smuggling "illegal" <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Mexico/">Mexican</a> products.</p>

<p>A second raid occurred in Chula Vista, CA when FDA, DEA, IRS and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/SanDiego.html">San Diego</a>
Police, unexpectedly entered the home of Lance and Jane Griffin, owners of 
Omniopathy, Inc. a supplement and pharmaceutical manufacturer and 
distributor. (San Diego was the site of 23 raids of homes and businesses).  
Also raided was the home of Lance and Jane Griffin and Dr. & Mrs. Marvin 
Hutchinson, Ph.D, biochemists.  One eyewitness report report of the raid on 
Dr. Hutcheson's house in Chula Vista, was particularly disturbing: "They 
broke his door down with a battering ram, accosted his wife who was nursing 
her baby, handcuffed her, grabbed Marvin, handcuffed him, and would not let 
either one come outside to talk with me during the course of the 11 hour 
raid."  Similarly, in another eye witness account, "Jane Griffin answered 
[the door] and was grabbed by the shoulders by a uniformed San Diego 
policeman who manhandled her several feet backwards [and] while a dozen 
other agents with guns drawn demanded that everyone freeze."</p>

<title>CIA Director Admits Problems</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: June/July 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>CIA Director Admits Problems</h1>

<p>Critics have long charged the CIA with tolerating, condoning and even
participating in acts of cruelty and human rights violations abroad. Now
the the CIA's director admits there are problems.</p>

<p>John Deutch, appointed CIA director in June 1995, wants to ensure that
U.S. espionage is consistent with "American interests and American values,"
Deutch said in an interview with the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/N/NandO.html"><cite>News & Observer</cite></a>.</p>

<p>Deutch told the Senate intelligence committee that he was
concerned about charges of the CIA's "complicity in human rights abuses,
payments to assets implicated in human rights abuses, actions in violation of
government policy and failure to notify Congress."</p>

<p>Among the problems is the CIA's personnel system, which is "not attuned to
attract and keep the best people," Deutch said.</p>

<p>Referring to recent allegations of CIA involvement in murders of Americans
in Central America, Deutch said, "We'll start in Guatemala and work our way
north, east, south and west."</p>

<p>The CIA's budget is part of an overall classified intelligence budget
estimated at $28 billion per year.</p>

<title>Ames Crippled CIA</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: spied 1985 - 1994; arrested February 1994; convicted 1994 -->
</head>
<body>

<h1>CIA fed Soviet misinformation to President</h1>

<p>From 1985 to 1994, CIA agent Aldrich Ames served as a double agent for
the Soviets, causing immense damage to U.S. national security. Ames
caused the death of at least nine U.S. spies, rendered U.S. intelligence
operations in the Soviet Union ineffective, and supplied disinformation
that the CIA fed to the president and top advisers.</p>

<p>The CIA passed along the information, despite knowing that some of it
was contaminated. The Defense Department used Ames' disinformation
to justify multibillion-dollar weapons systems. The Soviets succeeded in
convincing US policy makers that they were militarily strong when in fact
they were near collapse.</p>

<p>The disinformation continued with
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russian</a> intelligence
after the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Ames was arrested in February 1994, convicted and sentenced to life
in prison without parole. Probably the only reason he was not executed
is that he made it clear he had more information about the Soviets to give.</p>

<title>Czechs a Smuggling Haven</title>
<!-- Place: Prague, Czech Republic -->
<!-- Time: 1990's -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Czech Republic is Arms Smuggling Crossroads</h1>

<p>The <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/CzechRepublic/">Czech</a> capital city
of <a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/CzechRepublic/Prague.html">Prague</a>
has become a center of drug and weapon smuggling.</p>

<p>The Czech government is trying to crack down on the smugglers, but as
with all black markets, the smugglers find ways around the authorities.</p>

<p>The London <cite>Observer</cite> reported on one government raid. Black-clad
masked gunmen stormed a posh nightclub where a private party was underway.
The gunmen, Czech antiterrorist police, suspected
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russian</a> mafia bosses, but
ended up with nothing. All seventy guests were released without charge.</p>

<p>The Czech Republic is a popular place for smugglers partly because of its
location in the center of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe</a> and partly because of contacts
with the
former Soviets. The Czechs mostly serve as middlemen, linking weapon
providers with willing customers.</p> 

<p>Russian army officers use Czech middlemen to smuggle arms to <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/Bosnia/">Bosnian</a>
Serbs, while Germans use them to smuggle arms to Bosnian Croats and Muslims.
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Africa/">African</a> countries also make use
of Czech contacts. Officials estimate that
$4 billion of the Czech smuggling trade is laundered in Moscow and Israel.</p>

<p>The Czechs are actually famous in the arms industry for several well-made
products, including Semtex (an explosive), Tamara (passive radar capable of
detecting Stealth technology) and pistols.</p>

<p>I suspect that smuggling is popular in the Czech Republic for another
reason as well. As one of the most free economies in the world, the Czechs
attract entrepreneurs and risk-takers of all sorts.</p>

<title>World Trade Organization</title>
<!-- Place: global -->
<!-- Time: treaty signed April 15, 1994; adopted by U.S. Congress ??? 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The World Trade Organization</h1>

<p>From the May 6, 1994 <cite>Human Events</cite>:</p>

<h2>Gingrich Warns: CLINTON TRADE ACCORD MOVES TOWARD WORLD GOVERNMENT</h2>

<p>By James M. Sheehan, <a href="/revolution/by_name/C/CEI.html">CEI</a>
research associate</p>

<p> Representatives from over 100 nations gathered in Marrakesh,
Morocco, April 15 to sign the Uruguay Round accord, the most
ambitious and comprehensive trade agreement in history.  If
ratified by Congress, the agreement will establish the World
Trade Organization (WTO), a global super-agency that will replace
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at the
beginning of 1995.</p>

<p> Ratification of the agreement, negotiated by U.S. Trade
Representative Mickey Kantor, was seen as a virtual lock when
completed in Morocco.  The entire Republican leadership in the
Senate and the House of Representatives had endorsed the accord.</p>

<p> Like NAFTA, the WTO enjoys special "fast track" rules that
do not require the Senate to ratify by a two-thirds vote, as with
any other treaty.  A simple majority of both houses of Congress
is all that is necessary to ratify the agreement.  Congress has a
limited time for debate and is not allowed to amend the
agreement's terms.  For the Clinton Administration, it looked
like smooth sailing.</p>

<p> That is, until House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich began to
have second thoughts on national television.</p>

<p> Appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," Sunday, April 24,
Gingrich said he was reconsidering his earlier support for the
accord because of a "grave concern" that he could no longer
ignore.  When studying the Clinton proposal, the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a>
Republican found that "buried in the GATT agreement is a brand
new World Trade Organization....  This World Trade Organization
will have 117 member nations with one vote each.  So, in effect,
we could be outvoted by Antigua or by Botswana or by Venezuela."</p>

<hr>

<h2>GATT vs. WTO</h2>

<p> Gingrich went on to say that he was more comfortable with
the old GATT, a consensual partnership in voluntary tariff
reductions that has been in place since 1948.  What terrifies the
minority whip is that ratification of the trade pact would
transform GATT "into a Third World-dominated, dictatorship-
dominated system" that could exert authority over U.S. economic
policies and infringe on national sovereignty.  Gingrich
declared, "I'm for world trade, but I'm against world government."</p>

<p> The main change in the new WTO is that it holds binding
authority over global trade matters, whereas GATT is merely a
contractual arrangement between nations.  For example, under
GATT, a single nation can veto a finding by a GATT panel that its
laws are not GATT-legal.  But under the WTO, if a panel finds
that a nation's laws are not WTO-legal, that decision is final,
unless all nations vote to reject the finding.  Also, rules-
changes under GATT can be made only by a consensus decision. 
Under WTO, amendments to the rules can go into effect by a vote
of two-thirds or three-fourths of the members, depending on the
circumstances.</p>

<p> Opposing Gingrich on "Meet the Press" was Labor Secretary
Robert Reich, who defended the WTO as representing the same
"basic principles" that Gingrich had supported in NAFTA.  But
Gingrich rejected the comparison of the WTO with an agreement
among only three countries, the U.S., <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canada</a>, and <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Mexico/">Mexico</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The U.N. of World Trade?</h2>

<p> Gingrich said the WTO would function more like the United
Nations.  "Do you really want to create the United Nations of
world trade and have the kind of mess you have in UNESCO [the
United Nations Educational, Social, and Cultural
Organization]...?" he asked.  Gingrich then pointed out that U.N.
incompetence is responsible for the current fiasco in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/Bosnia/">Bosnia</a>.</p>

<p> Gingrich's opposition could kill the agreement, since its
ratification depends on support from a majority of Republicans,
as was the case with Clinton's NAFTA.  Such GOP backing would be
nearly impossible without Gingrich, who has now begun to echo the
concerns that some conservatives were raising about NAFTA.</p>

<p> Republican senators such as Bob Smith (N.H.), Ted Stevens
(<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ak/">Alaska</a>)
and Larry Craig (<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/id/">Idaho</a>)
all cited fears about national
sovereignty when casting their votes against NAFTA last November. 
Sovereignty concerns spanned both sides of the political spectrum
as conservative columnist Patrick Buchanan lobbied against NAFTA
alongside left-wing consumer activist Ralph Nader.  Gingrich's
comments may suggest a similar alliance will form against the WTO.</p>

<p> Nader's budding campaign against the WTO has focused on many
issues dear to conservative hearts.  Nader warns that the WTO
will "impose an autocracy above our modest democracy."  Decisions
about trade policies will be made by unaccountable, unelected
bureaucrats in Geneva.  "Harmonization committees" will be used
to alter U.S. trade policies and health, safety and environmental
standards.</p>

<p> Nader agrees with Gingrich that appointments to the WTO
Secretariat would be dominated by corrupt regimes, possibly
undermining U.S. interests.</p>

<p> The WTO agreement obligates the United States to "harmonize"
its food safety and sanitary standards with other WTO members,
basing them on international standards set by such United Nations
organizations as the Secretariat of the International Plant
Protection Convention, the Codex Alimentarius Commission (food
safety matters), and the International Office of Epizootics
(animal health matters).</p>

<p> Gingrich was also dismayed by the attempt by the Clinton
Administration, abetted by protectionist <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/France/">France</a>, to enforce
global environmental standards and labor rights against poorer
countries.  Almost singlehandedly, Kantor has succeeded in
placing environmental and labor rules on the WTO agenda through
its numerous work committees.  One such body, the Kantor-inspired
Committee on Trade and the Environment, created March 21, will
develop new WTO rules promoting environmentally "sustainable
development," the policy designed at the United Nations Earth
Summit in 1992.</p>

<p> Trade negotiators also produced a "side letter" that
authorizes the WTO to take up labor-related issues such as the
right to form unions, strict health and safety regulations, and
possibly even minimum wages.</p>

<p> Kantor's proposals parallel those of Jessica Mathews, senior
fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and a former
high-ranking official of the Clinton State Department.  In a
recent op-ed article for the Washington Post, she argued that the
"greening" of trade should force the world trading system to
"drastically change its thinking."</p>

<p> Because trade is now conducted "as though air, water, and
species stay neatly within the lines on a map," Mathews advocates
an international planning bureaucracy in the WTO to "mesh" the
rules of trade and the environment, bringing them under firmer
control.  She is disappointed that Kantor's efforts to "green"
the trading system were met with resistance from other nations.</p>

<p> Republican leaders have objected that WTO intervention in
environmental and labor rights issues will lead to costly trade
sanctions and other trade barriers that will punish the U.S.
economy.  Even worse, WTO interference would stifle economic
advancement in the Third World, holding its peoples in poverty in
the name of nature.</p>

<p> Along with Bill Archer (Tex.), ranking Republican on the
House Ways and Means Committee, Gingrich sent a letter to Mickey
Kantor condemning the administration's plans to use the WTO "to
police environmental and labor standards throughout the world."</p>

<p> The Archer/Gingrich letter cautioned the Clinton
Administration that "the threat of the use of trade sanctions for
reasons unrelated to trade will constantly put the sales and
employees of [U.S.] exporters at risk."  The use of such trade
restrictions could result in reduced competition, they said,
leading to the creation of international government-supported cartels.</p>

<p> The WTO rules on subsidies further obstruct competition by
encouraging government handouts to industry for the purposes of
research and development, environmental protection and aid to
economically "disadvantaged" regions.</p>

<p> The Clinton Administration insisted that the WTO subsidies
provisions allow programs similar to the Super Car project, in
which the U.S. government funnels tax dollars to General Motors,
Ford and Chrysler.  Even Ralph Nader opposes empowering the
government to select winners and losers in industry by doling out
tax dollars, a policy he calls "corporate socialism."</p>

<p> Republican Sen. John Danforth (Mo.) has another name for it:
"European-style industrial policy."  In his view, the WTO would
"dramatically alter" the world trading system and "the
relationship between government and the private sector." 
Danforth believes that the WTO will get the United States into a
massive subsidies war with the European Community that will bust
the federal budget and cripple U.S. competitiveness.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Where's Full Debate?</h2>

<p> Frustrated by Congress' peculiar fast-track rules, Danforth
exclaimed: "Most people would expect a full debate to precede a
decision that Washington will plan our economic future in world
trade, and that the government will decide which U.S. industries
get billions of dollars in federal subsidies for research and development."</p>

<p> On the day Mickey Kantor signed the WTO in Morocco, a four-
page advertising supplement entitled "The New Age of Trade"
appeared in the New York Times.</p>

<p> Sponsored by a group of companies, including Arthur Andersen
& Co., SkyTel and the World Trade Institute, the ad depicted a
new insignia with "WTO" prominently featured and "GATT" fading
into the background, symbolizing the transformation of GATT into
what some have called a "new world trading order."  According to
that view, the WTO will form the third pillar of that order,
along with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
and will usher in a new era of global economic policy coordination.</p>

<p> An earlier version of the WTO went down in defeat in the
late 1940s when conservatives battled to prevent trade from being
politicized and the voluntary arrangement of GATT emerged as a
free trade alternative.</p>

<p> Gingrich's remarks recalled that earlier conservative
victory when he told Labor Secretary Reich: "I'm in favor of
GATT.  I'm not necessarily in favor of a World Trade
Organization."  What Newt Gingrich does next may well determine
the fate of the WTO.</p>

<title>Russians Not Coming</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1990's -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Russian Tanks in U.S.!</h1>

<p>Conspiracy theorists of late have maintained that the U.N. (and
various other world organizations, often involving Jewish bankers) is
planning to invade the U.S. and plant it under foreign control.</p>

<p>"Evidence" of this theory has included numerous sightings of black
helicopters and actual photographs of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russian</a> tanks being transported
by train in the U.S.</p>

<p>Leaving aside the fact that the U.S. is more likely to control the U.N.
than vice versa, this theory is fairly well debunked.</p>

<p>The June 25, 1995 San Francisco <cite>Examiner</cite> quoted a spokesman
for a National Guard base in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan</a> as saying
that the Russian tanks are
"part of a program, under way for at least 12 years, in which captured
foriegn military equipment is shipped by rail from Eglin Air Force Base in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a> for
analsyis by military contractors and the training of U.S.
soldiers."</p>

<p>The tanks are conveyed on open, uncovered flatcars to avoid paranoid
suspicion.</p>

<p>Even though conspiracy theories are mainly bunk, they should not be
ignored by the political mainstream. They are a side effect of widespread
distrust of government, the symptom of a government out of touch with its
citizens. When conspiracy theories flourish, there is something wrong.</p>

<title>World War II</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>World War II</h1>

<p>World War II was the lowest moment for freedom in all of recorded human
history. Never before were the injustices of war extended to as many areas
of the globe at one time. Never before had the human desire for homogeneity
been taken to such mechanical and cold-blooded extremes. Never before did
belief in all-powerful government extend such a grip on politicians and
intellectuals in most of the world. Never before did the race for weapons
superiority lead to such lethal results.</p>

<p>On the bright side, the less unfree side won.</p>

<p>(The omission of much material here is strictly the result of time
constraints. I hope to add much more to this section in the future.)</p>

<title>Kashmir</title>
<!-- Place: Kashmir, India and Pakistan -->
<!-- Time: 1947 - 1996+ -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Kashmir</h1>

<p>The countries of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/India/">India</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Pakistan/">Pakistan</a> were formed
at the end of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a> colonial rule
in the area in 1947. Neither country was
too happy about the boundaries formed in the Kashmir region,
and since then they have fought two wars and engaged in numerous
skirmishes over it.</p>

<p>Jammu-Kashmir is India's part and the only majority Muslim state
in India. Separatist rebels, supported at least symbolically by
the Pakistani government, have waged a war in which 12,000 people have
died since 1989.</p>

<p>In the mid-1990's, fighting between the two countries increased,
although not to the point of a full-scale war. In January and February
1996, 25 people were killed, twenty of them when a rocket hit a
mosque. Each side blames the other for the rocket.</p>

<p>India is believed to have nuclear missiles, and Pakistan is believed
to be capable of building nuclear missiles. On January 27, 1996, ignoring
international criticism, India test-fired a ballistic missile with a
range of 155 miles and capable of carrying a nuclear payload. Strong
political forces in India advocate a nuclear build-up and testing.</p>

<h1>Taiwan</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/China/">China</a> is a good example
of how disastrous bad ideas can be. The
Chinese are extraordinarily successful everywhere in the world --
except mainland China. In 1949, Communists seized power in the
mainland, causing the ruling Nationalists to flee to the island
of Taiwan.</p>

<p>Since then, the People's Republic China has implemented a communist state,
while the Republic of China (the Taiwanese government) has implemented
a fairly free-market state. China's economic performance has been only
slightly better than dismal, while Taiwan has become one of the economic
powerhouses of the Asia-Pacific rim.</p>

<p>China considers Taiwan a renegade province, and maintains that
it will never allow Taiwan to declare independence. China has not
invaded Taiwan because of its formidable 400,000-person military
including a strong air force, navy and missile capability.</p>

<h2>Tensions in the 1990s</h2>

<p>In summer 1995, Taiwan began making more movement towards independence,
having its president visit foreign countries. After that, China began
conducting more military exercises near Taiwan.</p>

<p>In March 1996, tensions reached a new high when China began
extensive sea and air exercises very near Taiwan, even firing three
surface-to-surface missiles into waters near Taiwan's two main ports
of Kaohsiung and Keelong. China intended to scare Taiwanese voters
from electing a pro-independence president.</P>

<title>Sri Lankan Civil War</title>
<!-- Place: Sri Lanka -->
<!-- Time: civil war started 1983;
	govt takes Jaffna December 1995;

</head>

<body>

<h1>Yet Another Ethnic Separatist War</h1>

<p>One of humanity's favorite pastimes over the millenia of recorded
history, and probably before that as well, has been wars of ethnic
separation. The fairly recent advent of civilization has helped matters
somewhat, but even nations that aren't plagued with ethnic conflict
find themselves compelled to interfere in such disputes.</p>

<p>Just in case the U.S. or U.N. ever decides to cast its eye on
Sri Lanka, I'll put up a little background on that particular
exercise in futility.</p>

<p>Sri Lanka is an island country off the coast of India. Sri Lanka
has two main ethnic groups, the Sinhala (who control the government)
and the Tamils (who don't). The Tamils one day decided they
wanted to have their own country with a backyard and white picket fence,
and hence were born the Tamil Tiger guerrillas. I'm not sure, but
I think the Tamil's main grievance is that it is too hard to pronounce
"Sri".</p>

<p>The Tamils started their civil war in 1983, and as of 1996, are
still at it. The Sri Lankan government has launched many offensives
against the rebels, and in December 1995 scored big points by
taking the town of Jaffna, a rebel stronghold.</p>

<p>The Sri Lankan government estimates more than 50,000 people have
been killed in the 13-year war.</p>

"Sri Lankan forces, rebels prepare for new offensive," reprinted in the

<h1>The Civil War In Somalia</h1>

<p>The official story: the <a href="/revolution/by_place/Africa/">African</a>
nation of <a href="/revolution/by_place/Africa/Somalia/">Somalia</a>
was wracked by civil war and famine, much
the fault of warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed. The ever-helpful United Nations
step in for famine relief, and end up trying to defend themselves from the
bad guy Aideed.</p>

<p>The truth: Aideed, the elected leader of Somalia, but opposed by European
governments, had nearly finished consolidating his hold against
dictatorship-era holdouts. The U.N. stepped in and committed mass violations
of Somalis' rights, including trying to disarm them and shutting down free
speech.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>After years as an Italian colony, Somalia gained its independence in 1960.
Siad Barre assumed control of the country in a dictatorship. Aideed spent
the late 1960's and early 1970's in prison for planning a coup against Barre.
Barre eventually freed Aideed and made him ambassador to
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/India/">India</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/SriLanka/">Sri Lanka</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Singapore/">Singapore</a>.</p>

<p>Aideed helped form the United Somali Congress (USC) which deposed Barre.
Ali Mahdi proclaimed himself USC President of the Republic of Somalia.</p>

<h2>Civil War Begins</h2>

<p>In June 1991, Aideed was elected chairman of the United Somali Congress
by a two-thirds vote, but Ali Mahdi refused to step down as President.
By October 1991, Ali Mahdi had formed a government of eight ministers, and the
Italian government promised massive financial support.</p>

<p>Aideed declared his faction of the USC to be the legitimate government of
Somalia, and Ali Mahdi declared war on Aideed.</p>

<p>Aideed's militia forces quickly defeated Mahdi's, confining Mahdi's
supporters to a small area of Somalia's capital, Mogadishu. Aideed
could have captured the remainder of Mahdi's territory, but refrained,
instead concentrating his efforts on expelling what remained of Siad Barre's
army in southern Somalia. The robbery of Barre's army was mainly responsible
for the famine in that region.</p>

<p>The main difference between Aideed's faction and Mahdi's is that Mahdi
supports an Italian-style democracy (and is supported by European nations and
businesses), while Aideed favors the traditional tribal form of government
known as kritarchy.</p>

<p>Various Somali clans sided with Aideed. On March 30, 1993, the four
tribes of northwest Somalia adopted the traditional Somali constitution, the
Xeer (pronounced "hair"). On June 4, two more clans from northeast and center
Somalia adopted the Xeer. Violence decreased as the clans adopted a peaceful
government.</p>

<h2>The U.N. Intervenes</h2>

<p>The U.N. opened an office in Mogadishu a few months after Aideed routed
Mahdi's forces. U.N. Representative Mohamed Sahnoun realized he was too late
to mediate between the two factions, and concentrated on reducing the famine
in southern Somalia.</p>

<p>The U.N. Secretary General wanted a more visible role and fired Sahnoun.
Sahnoun's successors declared Somalia an anarchy, Aideed a bandit, and
firearms the problem. The U.N. then embarked on a military occupation of
Somalia and a full disarmament of its population.</p>

<p>The U.N. decried Somalia's lack of ability to govern itself, not mentioning
that only foreign subsidy was able to keep dictator Siad Barre in power, and
that foreign governments rejected the Somali majority's choice of
government (Aideed's) in favor of someone who would do their bidding
(Mahdi). Somalia is perfectly capable of governing itself when foreigners
keep their noses in their own business.</p>

<p>The U.N.'s expensive campaign resulted in more violence, as the Somali
tribes fought to preserve their right to keep and bear arms.</p>

<p>On June 5, 1993, U.N. troops attempted to shut down Somali militia
leader Mohamed Farah Aideed's radio station because it was broadcasting
"propaganda" (that is, anti-U.N. messages). In a victory for free speech,
Somali militiamen repelled the attack, killing 24
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Pakistan/">Pakistani</a> troops.</p>

<p>The Somalis' successful repulse of the U.N. attack led the United States
to begin an expensive, bloody, five-month manhunt for Aideed. Dozens of U.S.
and U.N. troops, and hundreds of Somalis, were killed. In October 1993, the
U.S. ended the search after eighteen U.S. soldiers were killed and some of
their corpses dragged through the streets of Mogadishu.</p>

<p>During the weeks from June 5 to October 3, 1993, U.N/U.S. forces inflicted
6,000 to 10,000 casualties on the Somali resistance, said Eric Schmitt in the
the December 8, 1993 New York <cite>Times</cite>. Schmitt confirmed the
account with U.S. military intelligence, relief workers, U.N. officials and
the U.S. special envoy to Somalia. U.S. Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni
estimated that two-thirds of the casualties were women and children.</p>
<!-- note: original source listed Zinni as Army Major General,
private email from rentner@mother.com said Marine Corps General -->

<p>Only a small fraction of the money spent by the U.N.  on "relief efforts"
-- the equivalent of hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars -- actually
benefited Somalis. Most of the money was spent on the U.N./U.S. effort
itself, according to the November 28, 1993 Los Angeles <cite>Times</cite>.
Foreign businesspeople profited immensely from such items as fast-food sales
to occupying soldiers, a $9-million sewer system in the U.N./U.S. headquarters
and helicopter flights for Western officials.</p>

<h2>Somalia After the U.N.</h2>

<p>In March 1994, U.S. and other Western troops withdrew from Somalia, and
by March 1995 the remaining African and Asian U.N. troops withdrew.</p>

<p>The <cite>News and Observer</cite> reported, "The city has been
generally quieter since U.N. forces left in early March, although there is
sporadic factional fighting."</p>

<p>In June 1995, the United Somali Congress - Somali National Alliance
(USC-SNA) called a Congress, at which Aideed was ousted as chairman,
and replaced by former ally Osman Hassan Ali Atto. Atto called for a return
of U.N. troops to help "rebuild" Somalia.</p>

<p>Aideed refused to recognize the congress, believing it to be
foreign-manipulated. Aideed's supporters elected him president of Somalia.</p>

<p>In September 1995, in a major military move, Aideed and
six hundred militiamen siezed the southern Somali city of Baidoa. Some groups
reported heavy fighting and much looting, while travellers from Baidoa said
the takeover involved little bloodshed.</p>

<p>Fighting in the capital city of Mogadishu erupted again in October 1995
as Ali Mahdi's supporters fired at a banana ship to keep it from docking.
Somalia's banana export industry is tied to Aideed, and Ali Mahdi has banned
banana ships from Mogadishu's port. Aideed's rivals say Aideed collects
a tax on banana exporters and farmers, and that the banana companies give
Aideed military aid. (Heavily armed banana companies trying to sneak
past mortar rounds in order to <em>pay</em> taxes? Something's fishy here.)</p>

<h2>On Militias and Standing Armies</h2>

<p>Of particular interest in the failed U.N. occupation of Somalia is that
the Somalis successfully repulsed the great modern armies of Western
civilization. Somali soldiers are militiamen. They are unpaid volunteers
who fight not on orders, but out of desire to defend their communities.</p>

<p>Critics of the right to keep and bear arms often deride the notion that
untrained individuals with small arms could stand a chance against a
well-equipped modern army.</p>

<p>Supporters of a large defense budget often claim that a high-tech military
is the only possible way to defend a country in today's world.</p>

<p>They are both wrong, as Somalia has so clearly proved. A well-organized
citizen militia, protected by the right to keep and bear arms, is still the
most effective protection for the security of a free state.</p>

<p>Serbs, Croats and Muslims have been fighting each other in the Balkans
for hundreds of years. With the collapse of Yugoslavia, they began pouncing
on each other once again. NATO, the U.N. and other nincompoops felt a moral

<p>One of the many complications in all this is that the

<h1>Chechnya</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russia</a> has always been
an empire, ruling over vast territories of
many different ethnic and tribal groups. The Soviet Union represented
the peak of the Russian Empire, reaching across much of Asia and Europe,
with influence around the world. When the USSR's economy collapsed
from the internal contradictions of communism, the empire shattered into
little pieces. Ethnic groups re-established old ties, old claims and
old hatreds.</p>

<p>The area known as Chechnya is home to the Chechens, a predominantly
Sunni Muslim group. In late 1994, the Chechens announced their
secession from Russia. Since then, at least 30,000 people have been
killed in the ensuing war.</p>

<p>The Russians quickly dominated Chechnya militarily, including
the capital city of Grozny, sending in tens of thousands of occupying
troops and patrolling with tanks and helicopters. But Russian troop morale
and domestic support for the war quickly faltered, while the Chechen
troops remained fiercely determined to regain their homeland.</p>

<!-- January 1996: Chechen Salman Raduyev led raid into Dagestan,

<!-- Chechen General and President Dzhokar Dudayev -->

<p>From 1995 to early 1996, the Chechens waged a guerilla war against
the Russians, attacking occupying soldiers at night, and committing
bloody raids against Russian towns. The poorly equipped, ill-fed and
demoralized Russian troops offered little resistance.</p>

<p>By February 1996, Chechen rebel leaders walked freely among the
streets of the occupied Chechen farming town of Novogroznensky.
Russian soldiers patrolled the area but avoided direct confrontation.
In March, rebels launched a major assault on Russian troops occupying
Grozny on the day before Russian military and political leaders met
to discuss how to end the war.</p>

<p>In late March 1996, Russian President Boris Yeltsin announced
his peace plan for Chechyna, which boiled down to "we're getting
the hell out of there." In April two Russian battalions pulled out
of the area. Most Russian troops should be out of Chechnya by
the end of 1996.</p>

<title>Aegean Sea War</title>
<!-- Place: Greece and Turkey -->
<!-- Time: February 1, 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>War in the Aegean</h1>

<p>Anyone who remembers their ancient history classes knows -- well ok,
that's hardly anyone, so here's a refresher.
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/Greece/">Greece</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Turkey/">Turkey</a> are two
countries at the northeastern end of the Mediterranean Sea. Their
countries have been the sites of numerous conflicts over the past
three thousand years. The Aegean Sea separates them -- but not by much.</p>

<p>On February 1, 1996, outgoing Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller,
threatened to declare war if Greece attempts to extend its territorial
waters beyond the existing six. "If the territorial waters are taken to
twelve miles -- I will speak clearly -- this is a cause for war," Ciller
said.</p>

<p>Ciller's bluster is partly an attempt to bolster her political standing
in Turkey, where her True Path Party came in second in January 1996 to the
Islamists. But Greek and Turkish soldiers did face a tense stand-off on
some disputed islands before withdrawing.</p>

<p>"In our history lives can be sacrificed, but not land," Ciller said.</p>

<p>Greeks and Turks have fought wars since 1453, when the Turks overtook
the Byzantine empire's captial of Constantinople, ending Greece's
control of Asia Minor.</p>

Ciller warns Greece about war over sea," reprinted in the

<h1>U.S. Rep. Claims Terrorist Caught With Nuclear Device</h1>

<p>June 12, 1995, from Buz Osbourne (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]">
<a href="mailto:buzo@gulf.net">buzo@gulf.net</a>):</p>

<p>Did anyone else hear [U.S. Representative] Joe Scarborough this afternoon on
WCOA's Pensacola Speaks discuss Senate Bill 735?  While discussing it, he
said that the FBI already had enough power under existing
statutes and began citing instances that the FBI had foiled or
solved terrorist attacks in this country.  After a litany of
successes Joe mentioned that the FBI had caught a <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japanese</a>
terrorist on the Jersey Turnpike trying to get into <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York
City</a> with a nuclear device.</p>

<p>Now I don't know whether this was a slip of the tongue revelation
about an incident that has heretofor been classified, but I
surely don't remember anything on the news about this incident.
Does anyone else know anything about this incident?</p>

<title>Amtrak Sabotage</title>
<!-- Place: Arizona (USA) -->
<!-- Time: October 9, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Sabotage Derails Amtrak Passenger Train</h1>

<p>On October 9, 1995, an Amtrak passenger train derailed in the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a>
desert. Investigators determined that the rail had been sabotaged, and
copies of a note left at the scene claimed responsibility by the "Sons of
Gestapo," condemning federal police for their actions at <a
href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/rubyridge/">Ruby Ridge</a>
and <a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">Waco</a>.</p>

<p>The saboteur(s) removed bolts from a joint connecting two rails
and bypassed the warning system with electrical wire. One crew member
was killed and 77 people were injured when the rails separated as the
Sunset Limited passenger train sped by.</p>

<p>Investigators do not know who is responsible and believe the notes
left at the scene could be a ruse to divert attention. Among the theories
advanced for whodunnit are disgruntled railroad employees upset at
expected layoffs, Arizona <a
href="/revolution/firearms/militia/">militia</a> members,
neo-Nazi skinheads and Vietnam veterans.</p>

<p>The note left at the scene criticized federal police agencies,
especially with regard to the murderous sieges at
<A href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/rubyridge/">Ruby Ridge</a>
and <a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">Waco</a>,
calling them Nazis, and was signed "Sons of Gestapo."</p>

<p>Some questions: why would someone who calls themselves "Sons of Gestapo"
use "Nazi" as a pejorative term? And why would neo-Nazis take the side of
the Branch Davidians, a multicultural commune of whites and blacks, natives
and immigrants?</p>

<h1>Waco-related Bomb Damages Airport</h1>

<p>On October 13, 1995, a primitive explosive device damaged a
wind shear detection system serving <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York
City's</a> La Guardia Airport.
A handwritten note found at the site claimed the blast "is in response
to the <a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">Waco</a>
incident, for all our fallen brothers," and sported a swastika.</p>

<p>The explosion occurred at Flushing Airport, which is no longer in use
for aircraft, but contains weather equipment used by La Guardia Airport
across the bay. The makeshift bomb was placed next to a low-level
wind-shear alert system remote center, a device which measures wind speed
and direction.</p>

<p>Nearby residents have complained in the past about lax security in
the site, and teenagers frequent the area.</p>

<p>Investigators are unsure whether the Nazi note is authentic or a ruse to
mislead them.</p>

<p>It is surely ironic if neo-Nazis really are upset about the federal
government's destruction of the Branch Davidians at Waco,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>, because
the federal agencies acted in true Nazi fashion against a multicultural
religious minority consisting of blacks and whites, natives and immigrants.</p>

<h1>U.S. Trains Tyrants</h1>

<p>The United States has long seen a strategic interest in Central and
South America, dating back to the earliest days of independence. During
the Cold War, the main concern was the promotion of regimes that would
support U.S. policies, and the undermining of other regimes, especially
those that might turn to the Communist bloc.</p>

<p>During this time, U.S. military leaders have been willing to overlook
atrocities committed by allies. In fact, the U.S. military
has trained thousands of Central and South American military -- including
some who have gone on to murder and torture -- at the
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><A
href="http://home.fia.net/~soa/">School of the Americas</a>,
located in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/FtBenning.html">Ft.
Benning</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a>.</p>

<p>In "General Manuel Garc&iacutea Ruiz, Troop Commander in the Taking of the
Zapatista Territory, A Graduate of the School of the Americas, Known as
'Murderer's Academy'" in the March 6, 1995 <cite>Proceso</cite>,
Sanjuana Mart&iacutenez describes some of the School's graduates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>General Manuel Garc&iacutea Ruiz, presently in command of the XXIV
Regiment which occupies the "ejido" of Nuevo Mom&oacuten, in Chiapas, is one of
500 officers of the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Mexico/">Mexican</a> Army who
graduated from the School of the
Americas, located in Fort Benning, Georgia, U.S.A.</p>

<p>... The School of the Americas was founded with the aim of providing special
jungle training for U.S. soldiers.  Wood points out that later it became a
training center for members of the military from all over Latin America, with
courses on low intensity warfare, command operations, military intelligence,
psychological operations, and a long etcetera. That is why it quickly became
known as the "School for the Overthrow of Governments."</p>

<p> Initially installed in Panama, it left that country to relocate in Fort
Benning, Georgia. Wood recalls that the Panamanian newspaper <cite>La
Prensa</cite> coined another nickname for it, "The School of Murderers." On the
other hand, Panama's president Jorge Illueca referred to the school as "the
largest destabilization base in Latin America."</p>

<p>... [Human rights activist] Darrin Wood was able to obtain, thanks
to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States, the list of
the Mexican officers who attended the school in 1980, where the name
of Garc&iacutea Ruiz, who, as a lieutenant colonel, took a course
on "Joint Operations Latin America O-16" appears.</p>

<p>According to Wood's investigations, among the military who have gone through
that school are the six Peruvian officers members of a death squad which killed
10 people in 1992; four of the five Honduran officers quoted in a report by the
human rights organization America's Watch as the men responsible for the death
squad "Batallion 316", and 105 of the 246 officers mentioned in a formal
complaint about human rights violations in Colombia.</p>

<p> Furthermore, and according to a report from the Truth Commission of the
United Nations, about the war in El Salvador, out of the 69 officers of the
Salvadoran
Army mentioned as human rights violators, 42 graduated from the School of the
Americas; out of those 42, two were accused of the assassination of Archbishop
Oscar Arnulfo Romero, in 1980; three are involved in the case of the rape and
murder of three U.S. nuns and a lay worker; another is accused of having
directed the killing of 300 men, women and children at the River Sampul, in
1980; three were investigated in relation to the murder of labor union leaders
at the Sheraton Hotel, in 1981; three are accused of the massacre of 16
civilians in Las Hojas, in 1983; another for the murder of four <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/Netherlands/">Dutch</a>
newspaper reporters, in 1982; two were accused of murdering hundreds of
civilians in the town of El Mozote in 1981; six for the murder of ten civilians
in San Sebasti&aacuten, in 1988; 19 for the murder of the Jesuit priests from
The Central American University, in 1989, and two accused of having murdered
Doctor Bego&ntildea  Garc&iacutea Arandigoyen, in 1990.</p>

<p>Vicky Imerman, of <cite>Covert Action</cite> magazine gave the names
of other former students of the School of the Americas: General Leopoldo
Galtieri, Argentinian military dictator between 1981-1982, General Hugo
B&aacutenzer Su&aacuterez, dictator of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/SouthAmerica/Bolivia/">Bolivia</a> between
1971-1978, and actually condemned for genocide;
Colonel Jos&eacute Mario God&iacutenez of El Salvador, accused of having
committed 1,051 executions, 129 tortures, and eight rapes; Colonel Dionisio
Ismael Machuca, also from El Salvador, accused of 318 cases of torture
and 610 illegal detentions; H&eacutector Gramajo, Edgar Godoy Gayt&aacuten
and Jos&eacute Domingo Garc&iacutea Samayo accused of grave human rights
violations in Guatemala; Major Joseph-Michel Francois, former Haitian chief
of police, and a participant in the military coup against President Aristide;
General Humberto Regalado Hern&aacutendez, of Honduras, linked to drug
dealers in Colombia, and Panamanian general, Manuel Antonio Noriega.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The School maintains that its courses include an emphasis on human
rights, and that the atrocities occur despite, not because of, U.S. military
training.</p>

<p>"Our alumni includes 10 heads of state, 39 minister-level cabinet members,
and over 100 chiefs of staff of Latin American armed forces. In addition,
an untold number of graduates have been involved in disaster relief,
search and rescue missions, in providing medical care in remote locations,
in performing counterdrug operations, and in removing millions of mines
located throughout Latin America," wrote Public Affairs Officer
Capt. Kevin McIver in September 1996.</p>

<p>"We have gone to great lengths to develop a balanced curriculum
incorporating military strategy, student development, resource management
and human rights.  Along with the dramatic reforms in Latin America, our
emphasis has shifted over the years from countering low-intensity conflict
to advancing support for democracy and human rights."</p>

<title>Dugway Proving Ground</title>
<!-- Time: 1951 - 1969; sheep killed 1968 -->
<!-- Place: Dugway, Utah (USA) -->
</head>

<h1>U.S. Military Conducted Open-air Biowarfare Experiments</h1>

<p>A December 8, 1994 staff report prepared for the U.S. Senate Committee on
Veterans' Affairs included a description of the U.S. military's open-air
experiments with hazardous chemical and biological agents.</p>

<p>From 1951 to 1969, the U.S. military conducted hundreds or perhaps
thousands of such tests at
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ut/Dugway.html">Dugway
Proving Ground</a> near Salt Lake City,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ut/">Utah</a>.
In one case, Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) was found in the
nearby animal population. In 1968, over six thousand sheep died
following the release of a nerve gas from an airplane. The Department of
Defense initially blamed the deaths on pesticide use, but after autopsies
found a nerve agent, the Department reimbursed the ranchers whose sheep
were poisoned.</p>

<title>The Draft</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Draft</h1>

<p>... is slavery.</p>

<p>A society that requires slaves to defend itself is a society that should
be destroyed. Ours is not such a society, we need no slaves to defend our
freedom. It should be obvious, in fact, that enslaving people undermines and
destroys our freedom, not protect it.</p>

<p>You cannot be for American society and for the draft at the same time, any
more than you can be for freedom and for slavery at the same time. One opposes
the other. If you support the draft, you support doing away with the personal
freedom and responsibility that makes American society what it is. If you
support American society, there is no way to justify an institution that
works against it.</p>

<title>Infowar</title>
<!-- Place: global -->
<!-- Time: 1990s -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Infowar</h2>

<p>Military strategists are contemplating a new form of warfare arising
out of the computer-driven, information-based economy of today.</p>

<p>Advanced societies rely on telecommunications networks, electronics
equipment and information for the coordination of critical industries
and for warfare. Infowar, the disruption of these information channels,
is foreseen to become commonplace in the near future.</p>

<p>"Infowar" is evolving from the psych-ops and disinformation campaigns
of the twentieth century. In addition to leafletting, broadcasting and
other more established methods of information warfare, armies will use
computer viruses, network hacking, encryption cracking and frequency
jamming to wreak havoc on the other side's military operations, financial
institutions, media, transportation and other critical areas.</p>

<p>Such techniques will become more prominent as battlefield equipment
advances in technology. Future soldiers will be wearing helmets that
include microphones, earphones, night-vision goggles and a heads-up
battlefield display. Defeating such gadgetry through jamming or
disinformation will be a crucial component of infowar.</p>

<p>Infowar will also include battle simulations. Computer simulations may
convince strategists whether to fight or not. Entire wars could be fought
virtually, with the participants skipping to the peace treaty based on the
probable outcome as predicted by computers.</p>

<title>Immigration Nazis</title>
<!-- Place: Union County, New Jersey (USA) -->
<!-- Time: beating June 1995; arrest October 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Prison Camp Guards Beat Immigrants</h1>

<p>The U.S. has set up "detention centers" (prison camps) for illegal
immigrants. Politicians routinely denigrate immigrants, particularly
illegal immigrants, as the source of all evil in American society.</p>

<p>In June 1995, prison guards at Esmor Detention Center in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nj/">New Jersey</a>
beat and tortured twenty-five illegal immigrants after the immigrants
rioted to protest miserable conditions there. The handcuffed immigrants
were forced to run a gauntlet of two dozen officers who punched and
kicked them. Guards made the aliens say "America is Number One,"
strip-searched them, shoved some of their faces into toilets,
pulled one's pubic hair out with pliers and broke another's collarbone.</p>

<p>Many of the immigrants were university students and protest leaders
who fled political persecution in their native countries. One, a chemical
engineer from Ghana, compared the beating to the one he received from
his country's security forces after he questioned the way the military
dictatorship dealt with a tribal dispute. Two Romanian immigrants,
fleeing their country for what they thought was freedom, were scared
and confused by the beatings.</p>

<p>In October 1995, six of the guards were arrested for official
misconduct and face five to ten years in prison if convicted, double
that if a bias motive is proven.</p>

activists: Anti-immigrant mood set stage for beatings," reprinted in

<title>U.N. Budget Crisis</title>
<!-- Place: global -->
<!-- Time: 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>U.N. Almost as Financially Bankrupt as Morally</h1>

<p>In February 1996, the <a href="index.html">United Nations</a>
had a two-year budget of $2.6 billion, but faced a financial crisis
that may cause it to lay off some of its 13,000 leeches, I mean
professional and clerical employees, to prevent bankruptcy.
A U.N. advisory panel
recommended cutting 600 general nonprofessional staff (10% of
the total) and 550 professional staff (14%), freezing recruitment,
and not renewing short-term employment contracts.</P>

<p>Member countries "owed" the U.N. $2.1 billion at the end of 1995,
over half of that from the
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/">United States</a> alone.
U.N. dues are based
on "from each according to his ability" such that U.S. payments make
up 25% of the total.</p>

<p>Some U.N. proponents advocate a global income tax as a way to
reduce U.N. "dependency" on member governments.</p>

<hr>

<p>Source: February 5, 1996 Reuter Information Service article,
"UN considers cutting 1,100 staff in budget crisis," reprinted in

<h1>Japanese Atrocities in World War II</h1>

<p>Everyone is familiar with Nazi Germany's heinous crimes against humanities.
Many are familiar with the Soviet Union's like atrocities and genocides, and
some are aware of fascism's grip on other European countries. But people are
just now beginning to realize the extent of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japan's</a> butchery during World War
II.</p>

<hr>

<h2>POWs</h2>

<p>As reported in the San Francisco <cite>Examiner</cite>, Japanese prisoners
of war were kept in inhuman conditions:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In August 1945, Melvin Routt was slaving on a Japanese work farm,
surrounded by sick and starving comrades, when he heard an American plane fly
over, a B-29. Suddenly, he heard an enormous blast and looked up to see a
mushroom-shaped cloud 17 miles away: the radioactive ashes of Nagasaki.</p>

<p>"It was time we did come up with a bomb to burn these people down. ... If
the people in this country realized what was done (by the Japanese) to our
soldiers, and to civilians, they just wouldn't stand for it," said Routt, 73,
of Tracy, national commander of the American Defenders of Bataan and
Corregidor.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>What happened to Routt and his buddies in a Japanese POW camp was so bad
that  "it took me about 10 years before I could even talk about it,"  he
recalls.  "(I feared) we'd be labeled the biggest bull slingers in town.</p>

<p>"We got no medical care. ... We'd eat lizards, worms, snakes,
grasshoppers. ... Most of our people starved to death. ... (The Japanese
guards) told us we wouldn't survive it, but would survive longer depending

<h2>The Nanjing Massacre</h2>

<p>In December 1937, the Japanese army invaded Nanking, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/China/">China</a>. In the following
six weeks, Japanese soldiers killed over 300,000 civilians and POWs. The
brutal murders included mass rapes, using Chinese civilians for bayonet
practice, and other atrocities.</p>

<h2>Imprisonment and Torture</h2>

<p>The Japanese military imprisoned, enslaved and tortured prisoners of
war. Thousands of prisoners died. One prisoner, <a

wrote a book about his experience.  Lomax was brutally tortured after his
captors found a radio receiver he helped make out of spare parts. Lomax was
beaten, his arms were broken and water was poured into his nose and mouth.</p>

<h2>Sex Slaves</h2>

<p>The Japanese government only recently apologized to the thousands of
Korean and Chinese women enslaved as "comfort women" for Japanese troops.

<h2>Coverup of Crimes</h2>

<p>After the war ended, the U.S. government engaged in a concerted coverup of
Japan's war crimes. Only recently has the extent of Japan's crimes come to
light, and the U.S. government's coverup has been the result of scholarly
research in recent years.</p>

<p>Some researchers blame the coverup on the U.S.'s desire to turn Japan into
an ally against the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Other researchers believe the coverup was in exchange for the results of
Japanese human experiments relating to biological warfare.</p>

<h1>Indonesian Invasion of East Timor</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/EastTimor/">East Timor</a> is half of
an island in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Indonesia/">Indonesia</a>, about 300 miles
north of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Oceania/Australia/">Australia</a>. Colonized by
Portugal in the 1500's,
the native East Timorese are primarily Catholic.</p>

<p>The western half of Timor was part of the Dutch East Indies, which
became Indonesia in 1949. Portugal's 1974 "Carnation Revolution" ended
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe's</a> last great empire,
and in 1975 Indonesia <a href="index.html">invaded
and annexed</a> the
now defenseless East Timor.</p>

<p>Since 1975, Indonesia's military dictatorship has conducted a brutal
campaign of genocide against the East Timorese, killing 200,000 people,
or one third of the population.</p>

<p>Western nations knew of Indonesia's plans in advance, and tacitly
supported them. The U.S. and others wanted Indonesia's support in the
United Nations and feared East Timor might vote neutral or leftist if
it gained U.N. membership. As reported by John Pilger in <cite>The
Nation</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Four months before the invasion [Austrialian] Ambassador [Richard] Woolcott
cabled his government that Gen. Benny Murdani, who led the invasion,
had "assured" him that when Indonesia decided to launch a full-scale
invasion, Australia would be told in advance. Woolcott reported that the
British ambassador to Indonesia had advised London that it was in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">Britain's</a> interests that
Indonesia "absorb the territory as soon
as and as unobtrusively as possible"; and that the U.S. ambassador
had expressed the hope that the Indonesians would be "effective,
quick and not use our equipment."</p>

<p>On December 5, 1975, Henry Kissinger and President Gerald
Ford arrived in Jakarta on a visit a State Department official
described to reporters as "the big wink." Two days later, as Air
Force One climbed out of Indonesian airspace, the bloodbath in
East Timor began.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The United States did not merely ignore the Indonesians' aggression,
but supplied it with the military weaponry that made it possible.
Indonesia devastated East Timor's mountain rebels with American OV-10
Bronco and Skyhawk aircraft, supplied and financed by the U.S. government.
Cannon, bombs and napalm were also used against the East Timorese
resistance, known as the Fretilin.</p>

<p>The result was death on a large scale. Pilger reports of the mass graves
common in East Timor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are great black crosses etched against the sky -- crosses
on peaks, crosses in tiers on the hillsides, crosses beside the
roads. In East Timor they litter the earth and crowd the eye. Walk
into the scrub and they are there, always it seems, on the edges
of riverbanks and escarpments, commanding all before them. Look
at the dates on most of them, and they reveal the extinction of
whole families, wiped out in the space of a year, a month, a day.
"R.I.P. Mendonca, Crissmina, 7.6.77 ... Mendonca, Filismina, 7.6.77
... Mendonca, Adalino, 7.6.77 ... Mendonca, Alisa, 7.6.77 ... Mendonca, Rosa,
7.6.77 ... Mendonca, Anita, 7.6.77 ..."</p>

<title>Massacre at Kraras</title>
<!-- Place: Kraras, East Timor (Indonesia) -->
<!-- Time: massacre at Kraras summer 1983 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Massacre at Kraras</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Indonesia/">Indonesia</a> in 1975 <a
href="index.html">invaded</a> and forcibly annexed <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/EastTimor/">East Timor</a>, beginning
a campaign of violence that has killed 200,000 East Timorese.</p>

<p>One element of this campaign has been the massacre of entire villages.
During the summer of 1983, nearly three hundred residents of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/EastTimor/Kraras.html">Kraras</a>, thereafter
known as "the village of widows," were killed by Indonesian troops.</p>

<p>John Pilger reported on one of the East Timorese resisters, identified
only as Domingos:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Domingos is 40 and has been in the jungle since 1983. "My
wife was tortured and burned with cigarettes," he said. "She was
also raped many times. In September [1993] the Indonesians sent
the population of her village to find us. My wife came to me and
said, `I don't want to see your face because I have been suffering
too much.' At first I thought she was rejecting me, but it was the
opposite; she was asking me to fight on, to stay out of the village
and not to be captured and never to surrender. She said to me,
`You get yourself killed and I shall grieve for you, but I don't
want to see you in their hands. I'll never accept you giving up!' I
looked at her, and she was sad. I asked her if we could live
together after the war, and she said softly, `Yes, we can.' She
then walked away."</p>

<p>Domingos and his wife came from Kraras, now known by the
Timorese as the "village of the widows." During the summer of
1983, 287 people were massacred there. Their names appear on an
extraordinary list compiled in Portuguese by the church. In a
meticulous, handwritten script, everything is recorded: the name
and age of each of the murdered, as well as the date and place of
death and the Indonesian battalion responsible.</p>

<p> Every time I pick up this list, a testimony of genocide, I find
it strangely compelling and difficult to put down, as if each death
is fresh on the page. Like the ubiquitous crosses, it records the
slaughter of whole families, and bears witness to genocide: Feliciano
Gomes, 50; Jacob Gomes, 50; Antonio Gomes, 37; Marcelino
Gomes, 29; Joao Gomes, 33; Miguel Gomes, 51; Domingos Gomes, 30;
Domingos Gomes, 2 -- "shot."</p>

<p>So far I have counted forty families, including many children:
Kai and Olo Bosi, 6 and 4, "shot"; Marito Soares, 1, "shot"; Cacildo
Dos Anjos, 2, "shot." There are babies as young as 3 months.</p>

<title>Massacre at Dili</title>
<!-- Place: Dili, East Timor (Indonesia) -->
<!-- Time: November 12, 1991 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Massacre at Dili</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Indonesia/">Indonesia</a> in 1975 <a
href="index.html">invaded</a> and forcibly annexed <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/EastTimor/">East Timor</a>, beginning a
campaign of violence that has killed 200,000 East Timorese.</p>

<P>In 1991, Indonesian soldiers massacred three hundred or more people in
the East Timorese capital of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/EastTimor/Dili.html">Dili</a>. The Dili
massacre was different from
the many other such attacks by the Indonesians because it was videotaped
by foreigners. The foreigners were arrested and deported; one of them was
killed.</p>

<p>John Pilger in <cite>The Nation</cite> reported accounts of the
massacre by two survivors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After the killings in the cemetery," said Mario, "I escaped
being hit. So I pretended to be dead. The soldiers came and
searched all the bodies and me, and hit me on the head so that I
bled. They threw me with the other bodies onto a pickup truck.
They took us to the mortuary, locked the door and went upstairs.
Some of my friends were still alive, crying. They were calling out
for water. I told them the only water was dirty, so we must pray
together. I saw with my very own eyes that among the bodies
were children and old people. Suddenly I heard steps approaching
and I lay down again, pretending to be dead. Two soldiers came
in. One of them picked up a big stone, and the other got a tablet
from a jar. They then said out loud that if anyone was able to
walk they had to stand up. When some of my friends got up, one
of them was hit on the head by the soldiers with the stone; he
died later. I heard the blows, and it sounded like coconuts cracking
as they fall from trees. As they got close to me I stood up so
suddenly that the soldiers were taken aback. I told them I was an
informer, that I really worked for them. I didn't want to lie, but
this saved my life."</p>

<p> Abilio, a Timorese orderly at the military hospital in Dili, took
up the story. "I was at the hospital receiving the dead and
wounded," he said. "Most of them were dead, but some were
pretending to be. The soldiers didn't unload the bodies one by
one; they just pushed them down on the ground. If they spotted
one that was alive they killed him by running the van over him.
Some of the soldiers were afraid of killing more. So they ordered
the Timorese who were there to kill them. People said no, or they
ran and hid in the toilets. The Indonesians then tried to inject
them with sulfuric acid. But the soldiers stopped doing this as the
people screamed too loudly."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Western nations have turned a blind eye to the Indonesian violence,
and the U.S. even gave Indonesia military aid, weapons which were used
against the East Timorese.</p>

<title>Dili Riots</title>
<!-- Place: Bacau and Dili, East Timor (Indonesia) -->
<!-- Time: January 1994; September 8 - 9, 1995; October 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>East Timorese Riot</h1>

<p>Ethnic and religious tension has been severe in the island of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/EastTimor/">East Timor</a>
ever since the predominantly Catholic nation was <a
href="index.html">invaded</a> by the predominantly Muslim <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Indonesia/">Indonesia</a>.</p>

<p>This tension boiled over into riots several times in the mid 1990's.</p>

<p>In January 1994, residents of the East Timorese capital <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/EastTimor/Dili.html">Dili</a> and the
seaside town of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/EastTimor/Bacau.html">Bacau</a> rioted after
an Indonesian immigrant fatally stabbed
an East Timorese on New Year's Day. At least five people were killed in
those riots.</p>

<p>On September 8 and 9, 1995, dozens of East Timorese youth rioted in
Dili after a visiting Indonesian official insulted the Catholic faith.
Several police and Indonesian immigrants were attacked and injured in
the riots, and much property was destroyed. The Indonesian official was
later arrested for insulting other people's religion.</p>

<p>In October 1995, Indonesian officials arrested 120 youths for their
involvement in four more days of riots in Dili. Four soldiers were injured in
the crackdown.</p>

<p>Indonesian security forces marched in riot gear through the suburbs
of Dili, hauling away suspects. "They came here shouting 'Come outside,
East Timorese dogs'. I saw with my own eyes as they forced their way into
my neighbour's house and took away 14 youths," said one East Timorese.</p>

<p>The Dili riots, the worst in the 1990's, may signal a breakdown of
order in the occupied East Timor.</p>

<h1>Srebrenica</h1>

<p>Of all the inventions of government, war has caused more misery than
all others combined. War evokes the basest nature of men, and is
always and without exception accompanied by torture, massacres and rape.</p>

<p>The <a href="index.html">Bosnian war</a> is typical, although perhaps
its atrocities are better
known from its closeness to European powers and the intense interest shown
by the press and human rights organizations.</p>

<p>The Serb conquest of the Bosnian town of Srebrenica, a supposed United
Nations safe haven, exemplifies the hatred and violence of the war.</p>

<h2>Safe Haven</h2>

<p>The Bosnian war is typical of the countless petty tribal disputes
that have afflicted humanity throughout its history. Three main ethnic
groups, Serbs, Croats and Muslims, are competing for territory, some
desolate rocky soil in the shithole of Europe. For that, they ruthlessly
murder and rape each other. The Serbs have the worst reputation, probably
because they are the most successful at torture.</p>

<p>Into this atmosphere of ethnic hatred, the United Nations swaggered,
its usual busybody self, believing itself capable of mediating among the
parties. If the Serbs were capable of calm, cool deliberation, they would
be conquering the French Riviera instead of the former Yugoslavia, home
of the "Yugo," which was like a car only smaller.</p>

<p>In its wisdom, the U.N. decreed certain towns in Bosnia to be "safe
havens," where war was strictly off-limits. Srebrenica was one of those towns.
In response to the offer of U.N. protection, more than 40,000 mostly
Muslim refugees sought safe haven in Srebrenica.</p>

<h2>The Siege</h2>

<p>Dutch "peacekeepers" were assigned by the U.N. to protect Srebrenica.
The Dutch commander warned in May 1995 of signs that the Serbs were preparing
to attack, but the U.N. did not act on his warning.
Throughout June the Bosnian Serb army continued their preparations,
weakening the Dutch force by allowing troops to leave but not allowing
replacements, and by seizing supplies destined for the troops.</p>

<p>In the early morning hours of July 6, the Serbs began their attack,
firing at the U.N. compound and shelling a nearby village, continuing
their assault through the ensuing days. The Dutch asked the U.N. for a
NATO airstrike against the Serb artillery, but the request was rejected.</p>

<p>The U.N. was trying to get the Serbs to agree to peace talks, and
did not want to give the Serbs reason to reject talks. In order to
keep the Serbs in peace talks, they allowed the Serbs to conduct war
against Srebrenica, a rather contradictory stance best described as
accomodation.</p>

<p>By July 9, the Serbs were directly attacking the safe area. In a
scene blending the modern and the eternal, the U.N. commander faxed
the Serbian General Ratko Mladic warning him to stop his attack. The
Serbs ignored the warning, penetrating to the center of Srebrenica,
falling back from a Dutch blockade only under a hail of machine gun fire.</p>

<p>The U.N. commander for Bosnia, General Bernard Janvier, decided
not to act against the Serbs, despite his advisers' recommendation
for air strikes. The Dutch mistakenly believed Janvier had ordered an
air strike for the morning of July 11, and again warned the Serbs to
leave.</p>

<h2>The Fall</h2>

<p>When morning broke on July 11, 1995, in Srebrenica, the Serbs held their
positions, but stopped shelling the town. By 11 a.m., it was apparent that
there would be no air strike, and the Serbs renewed their attack.</p>

<p>At this point, Janvier finally approved a air strike, but it was limited
to four planes which only managed to damage one tank. Thousands of Serb
soldiers stormed the city, seizing Dutch peacekeepers as hostages and
threatening to kill them if air strikes were not called off. The U.N.
yielded to the Serb threat, and the Serbs assumed control of Srebrenica.</p>

<p>15,000 Muslims fled Srebrenica, attempting the three-day journey
through Serb territory to areas not yet overrun. The remaining
25,000 refugees jammed a Dutch camp in the town of Potocari.</p>

<h2>The Massacre</h2>

<p>On the night of July 11, 1995, the Serbs began their massacre of
Muslims. They shot at least nine refugees at the Potocari camp, and
allegedly raped several of the women. Over the succeeding days, the
Serbs would massacre as many as eight thousand people.</p>

<p>Survivors and Serbian civilians living near Srebrenica confirmed
the bloody details. Human rights observers, the press and military spy
missions corroborated the stories.</p>

<p>On July 12, the Serbs, led by Mladic, herded the refugees onto
trucks and buses, separating the men from the women.
The men were driven to Serb border towns, and crammed into warehouses,
schools and abandoned buildings. The Serbs pulled men at random from
the buildings, took them outside, beat some of them and killed others.</p>

<p>The Serbs then began driving the Muslims in groups of 25 to 30 out
into the fields, lining them up in small groups, and shooting them.
A handful of men survived by hiding under the dead bodies.</p>

<p>The refugees that fled Potocari were hunted down and killed in
a similar manner.</p>

<p>Among the evidence of the Serb atrocities are U.S. reconnaissance
satellite photographs. One photo shows hundreds of Muslims held in
fields at gunpoint on July 13; a U-2 spy plane photographed fresh graves
in the same fields two weeks later. Intelligence agencies collect far
more data than they can analyze, however, and the CIA required survivors'
testimony to help focus their efforts on thousands of images in certain
areas, finally presenting the pictures to U.S. President Clinton on
August 4.</p>

<h2>War Goes On</h2>

<p>During the first week of August 1995, the Croatian army reconquered
Croatia's Krajina region from the Serbs, sending Serb forces into retreat.
Srebrenica now serves as a home for Serbian refugees from the Croatian
attack.</p>

<p>In September, NATO airstrikes pummeled Serbian heavy weapons in
Sarajevo. The Serbs agreed to participate peace talks in October.</p>

<h1>Yeltsin Warns of European War Over Bosnia</h1>

<p>As NATO conducted an air assault of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/Bosnia/">Bosnian</a> Serbs,
<A href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russian</a>
President Boris
Yeltsin warned that continued military intervention by Western nations would
result in a new war in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe</a>.</p>

<p>"In future we will have to respond adequately and help the Serbs," Yeltsin
said. "I have already signed a decree on humanitarian assistance. If these
attacks continue, then things will become much hotter ...
Those who insist on the expansion of NATO are making a major
political mistake. The flame of war would ignite across all of Europe."</p>

<p>Yeltsin's tirade is probably hot air to appease reactionary forces in
the Soviet, excuse me, Russian government, but that very fact points up the
instability of Russia's political situation.</p>

<p>Even when you don't consider the futility of intervening in a centuries
old religious and ethnic conflict, is it worth risking a nuclear war to
intervene in some backward global outhouse of a region?</p>

<h1>Muslims Terrorize Serbs After Regaining Sarajevo</h1>

<p>Sarajevo,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/Bosnia/">Bosnia</a>,
the once prestigious city that was home to the 1984 Olympics,
has seen some of the worst fighting of the <a href="index.html">Bosnian
war</a>.</p>

<p>Serbs took the city early in the war, but partly as the result of
peace talks in October 1995, transferred control of Sarajevo to the
Bosnian government in March 1996. By that time, most of the Serbs
living there had fled.
Serb leaders had warned residents of Muslim and Croat vengeance.
Other Serbs took a more forceful approach, burning apartments
and factories to leave nothing behind for the Bosnian federation.</p>

<p>In the Sarajevo suburb of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/Bosnia/Ilidza.html">Ilidza</a>,
about 3,000 Serbs, mainly the elderly
and sick, stayed in Sarajevo through the transfer of power.
The predictions came true as hundreds of Muslim looters threatened, harassed,
intimidated and robbed the remaining Serbs, under the watchful eye
of international police monitors. Most of the remaining Serbs are
now planning to leave, further demolishing U.N. hopes of a
multi-ethnic Bosnia.</p>

<p>"It is a shame, really a shame, that some of the people who have come from
Sarajevo are behaving in the same appalling and outrageous manner as some of
the Serbs were before they left," said police monitor spokesman Alexander
Ivanko.</p>

<p>Serbs returning home from shopping have found their possessions carted off.
Others have had to serve meals or give bribes to marauding thugs to convince
them not to occupy their houses.</p>

suburb changes hands, Muslim scavengers reign," reprinted in the

<h1>FBI Informant Talked With Nichols</h1>

<p>An FBI informant talked with James Nichols <em>in 1988</em> about blowing
up the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a> federal building, according to FBI documents obtained by
a Freedom of Information request.</p>

<p>Associated Press reported that an unnamed FBI informant visited James
Nichols, brother of bombing suspect Terry Nichols, at his Decker, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan</a>
farm in December 1988. James Nichols was upset at the U.S. government, whom
he blamed for the terrorist <a
href="/revolution/multi/war/lockerbie.html">bombing of PanAm
Flight 103</a> over <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/Lockerbie.html">Lockerbie</a>,
Scotland.</p>

<p>At the meeting, Nichols diagrammed the Oklahoma City federal building and
discussed how a "megabomb" could level it.</p>

<p>The FBI would not discuss why the informant visited Nichols.</p>

<p>Nichols denies the conversation ever took place.</p>

<h1>How Many Bombs in Oklahoma City?</h1>

<p>After a <a href="index.html">bomb</a> destroyed the Alfred Murrah Federal
Building in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a>,
many people speculated on who "really" was responsible.</p>

<p>Among the postulates pointing to alleged government involvement was one that
there were actually two bombs, not one, and that the second bomb was located
inside the Federal Building. Evidence to support this view includes a
seismogram recorded by the University of Oklahoma, and the pattern of the
bomb's effects.</p>

<h1>Is U.S. Government Lying About Oklahoma City Bombing?</h1>

<p>A consistent rumor floating around the net is that local television
stations in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a> have evidence contradicting the official
government version of the Alfred R. Murrah Federal Building <a
href="index.html">bombing</a>.</p>

<p>The rumor is probably nothing more than a "friend-of-a-friend" story.
One such post, forwarded from mailing list to mailing list, even
mentioned the television station, "KPOC-TV, situated about 10 miles
outside Oklahoma City." No such station exists.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Video</h2>

<p>This time from <a href="/revolution/by_name/G/IanGoddard.html">Ian
Goddard</a> to the
<a href="/revolution/politics/online/libernet.html">Libernet</a>
mailing list:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The video shows about a dozen media broadcasts aired within an hour after
the blast, in which it is unequivocally stated that the Army is now defusing
<em>three unexploded mercury bombs</em> found <em>inside</em> the building.
It was during this period that all rescue work was delayed for full two hours
immediately after the first two blasts.</p></li>

<li><p>It is clearly shown that the truck crater out in front of the building
<em>is not aligned</em> with the area of most several damage, deep
<em>within</em> the building itself. This evidence clearly <em>proves</em>
the truck was not to only source of the damage. The official gov't lie is
that there was <em>one</em> bomb.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Two</em> blasts were recoded by <em>two</em> siesmographs in the
area, one at the University of Oklahoma. The two waves, 10 seconds apart, could
not have been any other phenomena but two bombs the siesmologists
insist.</p></li>

<li><p>A woman who survived the blast said live on CNN that the gov't told
her to shut her mouth and stop asking questions about why the ATF offices
were empty prior to the bomb. She was very angry. She said essentially
"Did the ATF people have early warning? Why didn't my children have this
warning?" </p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Identifying John Doe #2</h2>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/D/DavidDeming.html">David Deming</a> reported
to Libernet:</p>

<p>"About two weeks ago an Oklahoma City television station (KFOR, channel 4,
405-424-4444) reported that they had identified 'John Doe #2.'  I did not see
the report, but it was discussed extensively on local talk radio station
WKY (am 930) and also nationally on the Art Bell show ... KFOR had something
like four eyewitness reports to back up their claims. They also reported that
"John Doe #2" is an Iraqi national who served in the Gulf War for Iraq ...
the KFOR-identified "John Doe #2" owns a brown pickup truck, similar to the
vehicle seen speeding from the scene of the bombing."</p>

<p>Later, Deming mentioned another video tape effort:</p>

<p>"An independent producer in the Oklahoma City area, Chuck Allen, is
starting work on a video tape on the April 19 Oklahoma City bombing.  Anyone
with any information should contact him at: Mr. Chuck Allen, 4004 Flora Dr.,
Norman, OK  73071."</p>

<title>John Doe #2</title>
<!-- Place: Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 19, 1995; October 26, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>John Doe #2</h1>

<p>Immediately after the <a href="index.html">April 19, 1995 bombing</a> of
the Alfred R. Murrah Federal Building in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a>, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/">Oklahoma</a>, federal
investigators released sketches of two suspects, initially identified only
as John Doe #1 and John Doe #2.</p>

<p>Investigators later arrested Timothy McVeigh, claiming he was John Doe
#1.</p>

<p>However, no arrests have been made for John Doe #2, and investigators
have even denied his existence, despite mounting evidence that there was
another person involved. Authorities said that an innocent Army private
resembled the sketches, but never withdrew the sketches.</p>

<h2>Grand juror dismissed</h2>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/D/DavidDeming.html">David Deming</a>
reported that a juror was dismissed from the grand jury on October 26, 1995,
for questioning the prosecutors.</p>

<p>According to Deming, "This particular person had revealed that the jury
was essentially being manipulated by the prosecution, and they were not
allowed to follow leads to the mysterious John Doe #2, or call witnesses
to testify who had seen JD2 in the company of Mr. McVeigh."</p>

<p>Deming continued, "Oklahoma City television station KFOR (channel 4) has
now, at the last count, interviewed 12 (count 'em, twelve) eyewitnesses who
spotted JD2 either with McVeigh or close to his wherabouts. They also have
2 eyewitnesses who have appeared on camera who spotted a total of 4 people
(McVeigh, plus JD2, plus 2 others) in front of the Murrah building only
minutes before the blast."</p>

<h2>Videotape shows second person</h2>

<p>On October 27, 1995, the Associated Press reported that a surveillance
camera captured an image of a passenger -- "perhaps the long-sought John
Doe #2" -- in the Ryder truck that blew up the federal building.</p>

<p>The AP interviewed a law enforcement source who said that the camera
showed an unidentifiable and shadowy image of a person in the passenger
seat about three minutes before the federal building was bombed.</p>

<p>The AP quoted the source as saying that many investigors believe John
Doe #2 is still at large. "No one knows who he is, it's like he walked into
a wall and vanished," the source said.</p>

<h2>Witnesses Maintain Stories</h2>

<p>Over a dozen people say they saw John Doe #2. Witnesses vary in
details, but agree on certain characteristics: heavy set, dark complected,
tattoos. Witnesses in Junction City and Herington,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ks/">Kansas</a>, say that
they saw John Doe #2 with McVeigh when McVeigh stayed there right before
the bombing. Witnesses in Oklahoma City saw him with McVeigh the morning
of the bombing.</p>

<p>In Junction City, an employee of the Great Western Inn claimed J.D.
checked in three days before the bombing and drove a Ryder truck. Three
guests at the town's Dreamland Motel, where McVeigh stayed for four days,
claimed they saw him outside McVeigh's room. A delivery man claimed
the man was there when he brought Chinese take-out to McVeigh's room.</p>

<p>In Herington, a convenience store clerk remembers McVeigh and J.D.
buying cigarettes. A local who went for gas remembers the same
incident. The owner of a local diner remembers McVeigh, Nichols and J.D.
eating there the morning before the bombing, parking a Ryder truck
and a tan car with Arizona plates outside.</p>

<h2>Conspiracy Theories</h2>

<p>The government's silence about the John Doe #2 suspect has led
many people to offer theories as to the cause of such silence. The
most likely is that any uncertainty on their part will be used by
Timothy McVeigh's defense to help his case.</p>

<p>More extreme speculations are that JD2 was a government informant,
or an agent provacateur who provoked the bombing to justify a
crackdown on militias. While there is currently no evidence for these
ideas, such possibilities are not without precedent in the U.S.,
and the views' prevalence says volumes about the extent of citizens'
distrust of their government.</p>

<title>Bombing Investigation</title>
<!-- Place: USA; Kingman, Arizona (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 1995 - ; Kingman May 1995 -->
</head>

<h1>Investigation of the Federal Building Bombing</h1>

<p>Federal investigators are continuing to build a case against suspects
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. McVeigh's friend Michael Fortier and
Nichols' brother James Nichols are possible targets as well.</p>

<h2>Kingman</h2>

<p>John Hiscock reported in the May 4, 1995 <cite>Electronic Telegraph</cite>
that FBI agents were having a hard time carrying out their investigation of the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a> Alfred R. Murrah Federal Building <a
href="index.html">bombing</a>.</p>

<p>The investigation led to the small desert town of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/Kingman.html">Kingman</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a>, where
suspect Timothy McVeigh once lived.</p>

<p>Hiscock reported that FBI investigators "are being frustrated by a wall of
local hostility." He quotes one agent as saying "I can't wait to get out of
here. I've never come across anything like this before, these people are
nuts."</p>

<p>Hiscock said the town is ambivalent about the bombing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The feeling in Kingman is one of approval that a government building was
bombed but regret that so many lives were lost. As Buddy Hinson, drinking in
the Smokehouse Saloon, put it: "Whoever did it would be a national hero if he'd
done it at night when nobody was in the building ... or if only a few federal
government people were there."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FBI's interest in Kingman results from McVeigh's residence there
beginning in May 1993. McVeigh rented a mailbox there, listing his home address
as that of his friend, Michael Fortier. McVeigh resided in Kingman motels
during portions of February through April 12, 1995. The Oklahoma City bombing
occurred April 19, 1995. McVeigh received mail at his Kingman mailbox
adddressed to "T. Tuttle," the name of a terrorist in the film
<cite>Brazil</cite>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Fortier Cooperates</h2>

<p>The June 21, 1995 New York <cite>Times</cite> reported that Michael Fortier,
a friend of Timothy McVeigh's, is cooperating with prosecutors in exchange for
some leniency.</p>

<p>Fortier reportedly admitted accompanying McVeigh on a trip to the Oklahoma
City federal building a week before its April 19, 1995 bombing, and having
knowledge of McVeigh's plans to bomb a federal office building as early as
fall 1994.</p>

<p>Fortier met McVeigh in the Army. Fortier is a resident of Kingman, Arizona,
a city in which investigators have spent much time.</p>

<p>Prosecutors have apparently granted Fortier some leniency, possibly
agreeing not to charge him as a conspirator, or agreeing not to prosecute
Fortier's family members including his wife.</p>

<p>According to the <cite>Times</cite>, "prosecutors' heavy emphasis on
gaining a plea agreement with Fortier suggests that they are having difficulty
assembling credible witnesses to bolster a largely circumstantial case
against McVeigh and Nichols."</p>

<title>Militias React to Bombing</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->

<h1>Militias React to Bombing</h1>

<p>Ambrose Evans-Pritchard's "Inside the underground world of America's secret
militias" in the May 1, 1995 <cite>Electronic Telegraph</cite> reported some
militia members' reactions to the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a> <A
href="index.html">federal building bombing</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Some units are semi-clandestine; others are totally secret, adopting the
cell structure of a proto-resistance force. ... I was given a glimpse of this
hidden world last week in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ar/">Arkansas</a>
when a source offered to take me "inside"
the local underground. My guide - a former police officer - took elaborate
precautions.</p>
   
<p>... A man in a grey business suit invited me into his office. He explained
that he had once held top security clearance, working for the US military in
electronic countermeasures at Nato installations in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe</a>. ... Four members of
his group are serving officers in the US Air Force, he said, and another two
are deputy sheriffs in county law enforcement. He claimed that his group has
access to the secrets of the US government's security apparatus.</p>
   
<p>There are plenty of other militia units in the state ... The most visible
group is the Central Arkansas Regional Militia, commanded by a retired Marine
Corps major named Drew Raines.</p>
   
<p>... Ross Hullett, commander of the Oklahoma brigade, is part Cherokee Indian
and a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured
People. In Oklahoma, he claims, there are 20 militia members underground for
every one in the open.</p>
   
<p>"He's right," said a member of a clandestine unit that covers north <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>
and southern Oklahoma. "There are four or five different groups in the shadows
around here and we're talking about dangerous people. I mean savage, vicious
people. I am one of them."</p>
   
<p>Behind it all, he says, is immense bitterness and pent-up anger over the
Vietnam war: "Who are the people running this government? Aren't they the ones
who dodged the draft and hid out in graduate school? Aren't they the ones who
sent out the poor white trash to do their dirty work - and then pissed on
them?"</p>
   
<p>... "Our government has been lying to us for too long, and Waco was the last
damned straw," said the Texan, a veteran of US Special Forces. "Now we're
telling them that they'd better straighten out this government and they had
better straighten out Waco because, if they don't, it is going to get ugly ...
You think you've seen terror? You haven't seen shit yet."</p>

<title>Bombing Site Heavily Secured</title>
<!-- Place: Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (USA) -->

<body>

<h1>Oklahoma Bombing Site Heavily Secured</h1>

<p>The federal government just can't seem to do anything in proportion.</p>

<p>According to a June 23, 1995 post by Bill Gorman
(<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:bj496@Cleveland.Freenet.Edu">bj496@Cleveland.Freenet.Edu</a>)
to Libernet, the feds have implemented heavy security around the
already-demolished <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a> federal building site.</p>

<p>Two private security organizations plus a federal police agency patrol
the site. Eight-foot high barbed-wire-topped chain-link fence surrounds the
site. There are several "perimeters" of security, the widest being several
hundreds yards out from the blast site. The inner perimeter fence is draped
with blue tarp, blocking any view of the blast site.</p>

<h1>Bosnia</h1>

<P>Okay, let's see, the Balkans are called "the tinderbox of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe</a>" for
its residents' tendency to kill each other, let's get the
world's superpowers involved in a conflict there.</p>

<p>Serbs, Croats and Muslims have been fighting each other in the Balkans
for hundreds of years. With the collapse of Yugoslavia, they began pouncing
on each other once again. NATO, the U.N. and other nincompoops felt a moral
obligation to get themselves killed as well.</p>

<p>One of the many complications in all this is that the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russians</a> have been ethnic
allies of the Serbs for hundreds of years, and don't take kindly to Western
nations' intervention on behalf of Croats and Muslims.</p>

<title>Bombing on Seismogram</title>

<!-- Time: April 19, 1995; May 23, 1995 -->

<h1>Oklahoma City Bombing Recorded on Seismogram</h1>

<p>Seismic waves generated by the April 19, 1995 <a
href="index.html">federal building bombing</a>
in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a> were recorded by at least two seismometers in the area.
One seismograph, the Oklahoma Geological Survey's, was located sixteen miles
from the blast site near Norman, Oklahoma. The other seismograph was located
four miles from the blast site in the Omniplex Science Museum in Oklahoma
City.</p>

<p>Both seismographs showed two or three events (ground motion)
happening around the time the bomb is supposed to have gone off. Many people
have speculated that the later events are the result of a second bomb, but
scientists have generally disagreed.</p>

<p>As reported by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard and Hugh Davies in the April 23, 1995
<cite>Sunday Telegraph</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><cite>The Sunday Telegraph</cite> has received copies of a seismogram from
the Geological Survey at the University of Oklahoma showing that there may have
been two bomb blasts, 10 seconds apart. The FBI says that there was only one
blast.</p>

<p>But the director of the institute, Charles Mankin, says that "this is
clearly not a refraction. The two surface waves had the same amplitude, wave
form, and shape. It's very puzzling."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The U.S. Geological Survey together with the Oklahoma Geological Survey
conducted experiments to investigate the issue. The USGS/OGS recorded the
May 23, 1995 demolition of the federal building's remains, comparing them
to the recording of the bombing.</p>

<p>The scientists differed in the interpretation. The USGS issued a June 1,
1995 press release, reporting that they believe the two seismogram events
were from a single bomb. They also said the events were about twice as long
as would be expected from an ammonium nitrate bomb. They did not publish a
report for peer review.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/D/DavidDeming.html">David Deming</a>,
a Ph.D geophysicist and assistant professor of Geology and Geophysics at the
University of Oklahoma, updated Libernet several times regarding the progress
of the investigation. In posts to Libernet on April 26, May 18, May 23, May 29,
August 17 and September 14, 1995, Deming described his research into the
matter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The record does show three distinct arrivals, timed at 9:02:02, 9:02:13, and
9:02:23 am, CST.  The first arrival appears to be distinctly different from the
other two, and is similar to micro-earthquake activity which is very common on
other sections of the record.</p>

<p>... The demolition [of the Federal Building's remains] was recorded on the
same seismometer, but, according to Dr. Charles Mankin, director of the
Oklahoma Geological Survey, looks "nothing like" the original blast event(s).
I have not seen the record myself. The preliminary interpretation would argue
against an interpretation of the second event on the April 19 record as
"the building falling down".</p>

<p>... I have also spoken with several people in the immediate vicinity of
the blast site.  They unanimously report hearing only one blast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Deming said that the two-explosion hypothesis "has now been discredited,"
explaining that "if the two arrivals at the FNO station 16.23 miles from the
blast site were separated by 10 seconds, then the 2 arrivals at the Omniplex
seismograph, 4.21 miles from the blast site, should have been separated by
10 seconds or less - yet they were separated by 16 seconds."</p>

<p>Deming reports that Ray Brown, a seismologist who interpreted
the April 19 seismograms for the Oklahoma Geological Survey, believes
the seismic data are most consistent with an extended period of
explosive activity rather than a single, discrete explosion.</p>

<p>The unexplained factor in the seismograms is how one truck bomb
could produce the same length of disturbance (approximately ten seconds)
as the demolition, when the demolition consisted of a series of staggered
explosions plus the building falling down.</p>

<p>According to Deming, Brown said, "The first seismic episode can be related
to the truck bomb. ...  Explosive energy at a level above that used for the
demolition and below that used for the truck bomb is judged to be the likely
cause of the second episode of seismic activity at the Murrah Building."
Dr. Brown can be reached at the Oklahoma Geological Survey, 100 East Boyd
Street, Sarkey's Energy Center, Room N-131, Norman, Oklahoma 73019, or by
phone at (405) 325-3031.</p>

<title>Bombing Pattern Suggest Multiple Bombs</title>
<!-- Place: Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (USA) -->
<!-- Time: bombing April 19, 1995;
	Key's memo June 27, 1995 -->

<h1>Pattern of Oklahoma City Bombing</h1>

<p>Many people believe the FBI and BATF are lying about the number, type and
location of the <a href="index.html">bombs</a> that destroyed the Alfred
Murrah Federal Building in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a>.</p>

<p>The pattern of the bombing is among the evidence against the
government's "single fertilizer bomb" theory. The damage was not centered
around the truck bomb's location, and some munitions experts claim that
no fertilizer bomb could have destroyed the building's support columns.</p>

<p>However, others have pointed out that geometric arrangement of ANFO
barrels as well as other tamping methods could focus the energy of the
explosion.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Multiple Bomb Theory</h2>

<p>Nick Hull (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:Glockist@AOL.com">Glockist@AOL.com</a>) posted this excerpt from
Tim Hudson's "Friends Faxing Friends" to <img src="/images/news.gif"
alt="[USENET]"><a href="news:talk.politics.guns">talk.politics.guns</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There were actually two explosions, the "truck bomb" blew first (for cover)
outside the building and then a string of charges wired together that were
physically placed on some of the building columns at ground level detonated
seconds later. The second blast was set to cause maximum structural changes.</p>

<p>... The truckbomb could never have caused the patter of damage that was
evident from the newspaper photos.  A truck bomb charge immense enough to
break, from a distance, those reinforced concrete columns, would certainly
blow out the exterior curtain wall at ground level on the opposite and
undamaged side of the building.  There is no such damage on the opposite
side exterior wall, which is intact.</p>

<p>The pattern of blown columns is not close to being circular as would be
expected if the blast emanated from one origin.  As we know, the power of
a detonation diminishes, proportionately as the distance (in all
directions, i.e. circular) is increased.  However, this pattern of
destruction is essentially linear, except for one indentation that should
have been, but is not directly opposite of the ground crater. ... Most
incredibly, there are intact window frames closer to the center of the
ground crater than are the missing concrete columns.</p>

<p>... The debris is blown out of the building as one would expect from an
interior blast.  An exterior blast would blow debris into the still
standing interior of the building.  In summary, this linear pattern is
totally indicative of high brissance charges placed directly on columns.
The 1200 lbs. of ammonium nitrate (a slow burn explosive) reported in the
press could not have caused this kind of damage to support columns from
that distance, no way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Oklahoma City Legislator Calls for Investigation</h1>

<p>Craig D.W. Hammond (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:spna@ionet.net">spna@ionet.net</a>) of Lawton, Oklahoma
reported to Libernet about local news coverage.</p>

<p>Hammond summarized an article in June 28, 1995 <cite>The Daily
Oklahoman</cite> about an <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/">Oklahoma</a> state
legislator who disbelieves the
government's version of the bombing.</p>

<p>Oklahoma State Rep. Charles Key (R-Oklahoma City) lost a close friend in
the bombing. In a June 27 memorandum sent to his fellow legislators, Key
called for an independent investigation, saying he does not believe a
fertilizer bomb destroyed the federal building.</p>

<p>"I am convinced that the government is not being forthright about
the kind of bomb(s), the number of explosions, the placement of the
explosives and other crucial aspects of the April 19 bombing," Key said.
"I'm convinced that for that building to come down like that, it had to have
explosives at the columns to bring it down or at strategic places.  The FBI is
saying a truck bomb drove up and sat out front and blew up."</p>

<p>Key's memo included a copy of a letter from retired Air Force Brigadier
General Benton K. Partin to U.S. Senator Don Nickles (R-Oklahoma). Partin's
letter claims "the damage pattern on the reinforced concrete superstructure
could not possibly have been attained from the single truck bomb without
supplementing demolition charges at some of the reinforced column bases."</p>

<p>Hammond also summarized a June 28, 1995 television interview of Sam Cohen,
inventor of the neutron bomb, by KFOR-TV (the Oklahoma City NBC affiliate).
"I don't care how much fertilizer and fuel oil they used, it would never be
enough," Cohen said. "Demolition charges placed at key column did the dirty
work."</p>

<title>Massacre at Kraras</title>
<!-- Place: Kraras, East Timor (Indonesia) -->

<body>

<h1>Massacre at Kraras</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Indonesia/">Indonesia</a> in 1975 <a
href="index.html">invaded</a> and forcibly annexed <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/EastTimor/">East Timor</a>, beginning
a campaign of violence that has killed 200,000 East Timorese.</p>

<p>One element of this campaign has been the massacre of entire villages.
During the summer of 1983, nearly three hundred residents of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/EastTimor/Kraras.html">Kraras</a>, thereafter
known as "the village of widows," were killed by Indonesian troops.</p>

<p>John Pilger reported on one of the East Timorese resisters, identified
only as Domingos:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Domingos is 40 and has been in the jungle since 1983. "My
wife was tortured and burned with cigarettes," he said. "She was
also raped many times. In September [1993] the Indonesians sent
the population of her village to find us. My wife came to me and
said, `I don't want to see your face because I have been suffering
too much.' At first I thought she was rejecting me, but it was the
opposite; she was asking me to fight on, to stay out of the village
and not to be captured and never to surrender. She said to me,
`You get yourself killed and I shall grieve for you, but I don't
want to see you in their hands. I'll never accept you giving up!' I
looked at her, and she was sad. I asked her if we could live
together after the war, and she said softly, `Yes, we can.' She
then walked away."</p>

<p>Domingos and his wife came from Kraras, now known by the
Timorese as the "village of the widows." During the summer of
1983, 287 people were massacred there. Their names appear on an
extraordinary list compiled in Portuguese by the church. In a
meticulous, handwritten script, everything is recorded: the name
and age of each of the murdered, as well as the date and place of
death and the Indonesian battalion responsible.</p>

<p> Every time I pick up this list, a testimony of genocide, I find
it strangely compelling and difficult to put down, as if each death
is fresh on the page. Like the ubiquitous crosses, it records the
slaughter of whole families, and bears witness to genocide: Feliciano
Gomes, 50; Jacob Gomes, 50; Antonio Gomes, 37; Marcelino
Gomes, 29; Joao Gomes, 33; Miguel Gomes, 51; Domingos Gomes, 30;
Domingos Gomes, 2 -- "shot."</p>

<p>So far I have counted forty families, including many children:
Kai and Olo Bosi, 6 and 4, "shot"; Marito Soares, 1, "shot"; Cacildo
Dos Anjos, 2, "shot." There are babies as young as 3 months.</p>

<title>Massacre at Dili</title>
<!-- Place: Dili, East Timor (Indonesia) -->
<!-- Time: November 12, 1991 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Massacre at Dili</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Indonesia/">Indonesia</a> in 1975 <a
href="index.html">invaded</a> and forcibly annexed <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/EastTimor/">East Timor</a>, beginning a
campaign of violence that has killed 200,000 East Timorese.</p>

<P>In 1991, Indonesian soldiers massacred three hundred or more people in
the East Timorese capital of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/EastTimor/Dili.html">Dili</a>. The Dili
massacre was different from
the many other such attacks by the Indonesians because it was videotaped
by foreigners. The foreigners were arrested and deported; one of them was
killed.</p>

<p>John Pilger in <cite>The Nation</cite> reported accounts of the
massacre by two survivors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After the killings in the cemetery," said Mario, "I escaped
being hit. So I pretended to be dead. The soldiers came and
searched all the bodies and me, and hit me on the head so that I
bled. They threw me with the other bodies onto a pickup truck.
They took us to the mortuary, locked the door and went upstairs.
Some of my friends were still alive, crying. They were calling out
for water. I told them the only water was dirty, so we must pray
together. I saw with my very own eyes that among the bodies
were children and old people. Suddenly I heard steps approaching
and I lay down again, pretending to be dead. Two soldiers came
in. One of them picked up a big stone, and the other got a tablet
from a jar. They then said out loud that if anyone was able to
walk they had to stand up. When some of my friends got up, one
of them was hit on the head by the soldiers with the stone; he
died later. I heard the blows, and it sounded like coconuts cracking
as they fall from trees. As they got close to me I stood up so
suddenly that the soldiers were taken aback. I told them I was an
informer, that I really worked for them. I didn't want to lie, but
this saved my life."</p>

<p> Abilio, a Timorese orderly at the military hospital in Dili, took
up the story. "I was at the hospital receiving the dead and
wounded," he said. "Most of them were dead, but some were
pretending to be. The soldiers didn't unload the bodies one by
one; they just pushed them down on the ground. If they spotted
one that was alive they killed him by running the van over him.
Some of the soldiers were afraid of killing more. So they ordered
the Timorese who were there to kill them. People said no, or they
ran and hid in the toilets. The Indonesians then tried to inject
them with sulfuric acid. But the soldiers stopped doing this as the
people screamed too loudly."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Western nations have turned a blind eye to the Indonesian violence,
and the U.S. even gave Indonesia military aid, weapons which were used
against the East Timorese.</p>

<title>Dili Riots</title>
<!-- Place: Bacau and Dili, East Timor (Indonesia) -->
<!-- Time: January 1994; September 8 - 9, 1995; October 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>East Timorese Riot</h1>

<p>Ethnic and religious tension has been severe in the island of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/EastTimor/">East Timor</a>
ever since the predominantly Catholic nation was <a
href="index.html">invaded</a> by the predominantly Muslim <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Indonesia/">Indonesia</a>.</p>

<p>This tension boiled over into riots several times in the mid 1990's.</p>

<p>In January 1994, residents of the East Timorese capital <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/EastTimor/Dili.html">Dili</a> and the
seaside town of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/EastTimor/Bacau.html">Bacau</a> rioted after
an Indonesian immigrant fatally stabbed
an East Timorese on New Year's Day. At least five people were killed in
those riots.</p>

<p>On September 8 and 9, 1995, dozens of East Timorese youth rioted in
Dili after a visiting Indonesian official insulted the Catholic faith.
Several police and Indonesian immigrants were attacked and injured in
the riots, and much property was destroyed. The Indonesian official was
later arrested for insulting other people's religion.</p>

<p>In October 1995, Indonesian officials arrested 120 youths for their
involvement in four more days of riots in Dili. Four soldiers were injured in
the crackdown.</p>

<p>Indonesian security forces marched in riot gear through the suburbs
of Dili, hauling away suspects. "They came here shouting 'Come outside,
East Timorese dogs'. I saw with my own eyes as they forced their way into
my neighbour's house and took away 14 youths," said one East Timorese.</p>

<p>The Dili riots, the worst in the 1990's, may signal a breakdown of
order in the occupied East Timor.</p>

<title>Oklahoma City Lies</title>
<!-- Place: Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 19, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Is U.S. Government Lying About Oklahoma City Bombing?</h1>

<p>A consistent rumor floating around the net is that local television
stations in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a> have evidence contradicting the official
government version of the Alfred R. Murrah Federal Building <a
href="index.html">bombing</a>.</p>

<p>The rumor is probably nothing more than a "friend-of-a-friend" story.
One such post, forwarded from mailing list to mailing list, even
mentioned the television station, "KPOC-TV, situated about 10 miles
outside Oklahoma City." No such station exists.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Video</h2>

<p>This time from <a href="/revolution/by_name/G/IanGoddard.html">Ian
Goddard</a> to the
<a href="/revolution/politics/online/libernet.html">Libernet</a>
mailing list:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The video shows about a dozen media broadcasts aired within an hour after
the blast, in which it is unequivocally stated that the Army is now defusing
<em>three unexploded mercury bombs</em> found <em>inside</em> the building.
It was during this period that all rescue work was delayed for full two hours
immediately after the first two blasts.</p></li>

<li><p>It is clearly shown that the truck crater out in front of the building
<em>is not aligned</em> with the area of most several damage, deep
<em>within</em> the building itself. This evidence clearly <em>proves</em>
the truck was not to only source of the damage. The official gov't lie is
that there was <em>one</em> bomb.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Two</em> blasts were recoded by <em>two</em> siesmographs in the
area, one at the University of Oklahoma. The two waves, 10 seconds apart, could
not have been any other phenomena but two bombs the siesmologists
insist.</p></li>

<li><p>A woman who survived the blast said live on CNN that the gov't told
her to shut her mouth and stop asking questions about why the ATF offices
were empty prior to the bomb. She was very angry. She said essentially
"Did the ATF people have early warning? Why didn't my children have this
warning?" </p></li>

</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Identifying John Doe #2</h2>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/D/DavidDeming.html">David Deming</a> reported
to Libernet:</p>

<p>"About two weeks ago an Oklahoma City television station (KFOR, channel 4,
405-424-4444) reported that they had identified 'John Doe #2.'  I did not see
the report, but it was discussed extensively on local talk radio station
WKY (am 930) and also nationally on the Art Bell show ... KFOR had something
like four eyewitness reports to back up their claims. They also reported that
"John Doe #2" is an Iraqi national who served in the Gulf War for Iraq ...
the KFOR-identified "John Doe #2" owns a brown pickup truck, similar to the
vehicle seen speeding from the scene of the bombing."</p>

<p>Later, Deming mentioned another video tape effort:</p>

<p>"An independent producer in the Oklahoma City area, Chuck Allen, is
starting work on a video tape on the April 19 Oklahoma City bombing.  Anyone
with any information should contact him at: Mr. Chuck Allen, 4004 Flora Dr.,
Norman, OK  73071."</p>

<title>Bombing Investigation</title>
<!-- Place: USA; Kingman, Arizona (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 1995 - ; Kingman May 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Investigation of the Federal Building Bombing</h1>

<p>Federal investigators are continuing to build a case against suspects
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. McVeigh's friend Michael Fortier and
Nichols' brother James Nichols are possible targets as well.</p>

<h2>Kingman</h2>

<p>John Hiscock reported in the May 4, 1995 <cite>Electronic Telegraph</cite>
that FBI agents were having a hard time carrying out their investigation of the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a> Alfred R. Murrah Federal Building <a
href="index.html">bombing</a>.</p>

<p>The investigation led to the small desert town of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/Kingman.html">Kingman</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a>, where
suspect Timothy McVeigh once lived.</p>

<p>Hiscock reported that FBI investigators "are being frustrated by a wall of
local hostility." He quotes one agent as saying "I can't wait to get out of
here. I've never come across anything like this before, these people are
nuts."</p>

<p>Hiscock said the town is ambivalent about the bombing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The feeling in Kingman is one of approval that a government building was
bombed but regret that so many lives were lost. As Buddy Hinson, drinking in
the Smokehouse Saloon, put it: "Whoever did it would be a national hero if he'd
done it at night when nobody was in the building ... or if only a few federal
government people were there."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FBI's interest in Kingman results from McVeigh's residence there
beginning in May 1993. McVeigh rented a mailbox there, listing his home address
as that of his friend, Michael Fortier. McVeigh resided in Kingman motels
during portions of February through April 12, 1995. The Oklahoma City bombing
occurred April 19, 1995. McVeigh received mail at his Kingman mailbox
adddressed to "T. Tuttle," the name of a terrorist in the film
<cite>Brazil</cite>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Fortier Cooperates</h2>

<p>The June 21, 1995 New York <cite>Times</cite> reported that Michael Fortier,
a friend of Timothy McVeigh's, is cooperating with prosecutors in exchange for
some leniency.</p>

<p>Fortier reportedly admitted accompanying McVeigh on a trip to the Oklahoma
City federal building a week before its April 19, 1995 bombing, and having
knowledge of McVeigh's plans to bomb a federal office building as early as
fall 1994.</p>

<p>Fortier met McVeigh in the Army. Fortier is a resident of Kingman, Arizona,
a city in which investigators have spent much time.</p>

<p>Prosecutors have apparently granted Fortier some leniency, possibly
agreeing not to charge him as a conspirator, or agreeing not to prosecute
Fortier's family members including his wife.</p>

<p>According to the <cite>Times</cite>, "prosecutors' heavy emphasis on
gaining a plea agreement with Fortier suggests that they are having difficulty
assembling credible witnesses to bolster a largely circumstantial case
against McVeigh and Nichols."</p>

<h1>Indonesian Invasion of East Timor</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/EastTimor/">East Timor</a> is half of
an island in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Indonesia/">Indonesia</a>, about 300 miles
north of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Oceania/Australia/">Australia</a>. Colonized by
Portugal in the 1500's,
the native East Timorese are primarily Catholic.</p>

<p>The western half of Timor was part of the Dutch East Indies, which
became Indonesia in 1949. Portugal's 1974 "Carnation Revolution" ended
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe's</a> last great empire,
and in 1975 Indonesia <a href="index.html">invaded
and annexed</a> the
now defenseless East Timor.</p>

<p>Since 1975, Indonesia's military dictatorship has conducted a brutal
campaign of genocide against the East Timorese, killing 200,000 people,
or one third of the population.</p>

<p>Western nations knew of Indonesia's plans in advance, and tacitly
supported them. The U.S. and others wanted Indonesia's support in the
United Nations and feared East Timor might vote neutral or leftist if
it gained U.N. membership. As reported by John Pilger in <cite>The
Nation</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Four months before the invasion [Austrialian] Ambassador [Richard] Woolcott
cabled his government that Gen. Benny Murdani, who led the invasion,
had "assured" him that when Indonesia decided to launch a full-scale
invasion, Australia would be told in advance. Woolcott reported that the
British ambassador to Indonesia had advised London that it was in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">Britain's</a> interests that
Indonesia "absorb the territory as soon
as and as unobtrusively as possible"; and that the U.S. ambassador
had expressed the hope that the Indonesians would be "effective,
quick and not use our equipment."</p>

<p>On December 5, 1975, Henry Kissinger and President Gerald
Ford arrived in Jakarta on a visit a State Department official
described to reporters as "the big wink." Two days later, as Air
Force One climbed out of Indonesian airspace, the bloodbath in
East Timor began.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The United States did not merely ignore the Indonesians' aggression,
but supplied it with the military weaponry that made it possible.
Indonesia devastated East Timor's mountain rebels with American OV-10
Bronco and Skyhawk aircraft, supplied and financed by the U.S. government.
Cannon, bombs and napalm were also used against the East Timorese
resistance, known as the Fretilin.</p>

<p>The result was death on a large scale. Pilger reports of the mass graves
common in East Timor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are great black crosses etched against the sky -- crosses
on peaks, crosses in tiers on the hillsides, crosses beside the
roads. In East Timor they litter the earth and crowd the eye. Walk
into the scrub and they are there, always it seems, on the edges
of riverbanks and escarpments, commanding all before them. Look
at the dates on most of them, and they reveal the extinction of
whole families, wiped out in the space of a year, a month, a day.
"R.I.P. Mendonca, Crissmina, 7.6.77 ... Mendonca, Filismina, 7.6.77
... Mendonca, Adalino, 7.6.77 ... Mendonca, Alisa, 7.6.77 ... Mendonca, Rosa,
7.6.77 ... Mendonca, Anita, 7.6.77 ..."</p>

<title>Credit Cards in Belize</title>
<!-- Place: Belize -->
<!-- Time: May 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Credit Card Privacy</h1>

<p>Excerpts from an anonymous post to Libernet in May 1995:</p>

<p>I trashed the <a href="/revolution/by_name/T/TerraLibra.html">Terra Libra</a>
project some months ago. You might remember the
description of a flat pyramid marketing scheme where you "sell freedom
technology."  They also are pushing a gold-based banking system that looks like
it may be enjoying some success. The most useful aspect I have seen so far from
the project is a low-cost offshore trust offer.</p>

<p>Terra Libra now has the offshore account based in Belize, where a recent
supreme court decision "upheld the country's confidentiality laws by revoking a
previous court order set in motion by the SEC of the US requesting that
confidential documents, belonging to Swiss Trade and Commerce Trust, Ltd., be
handed over to them."  It looks like little Belize stood up to the SEC and will
now become a banking haven in the traditional Bahamian manner.</p>

<p>It takes $800 to set one of these accounts up for yourself, or as little as
$200 with three other sign-ups, and, again, it starts with $200 in it so your
effective cost will be as little as $0 and as much as $600 if you do not want
to participate in the multi-level marketing scheme.</p>

<p>There is a big difference now, though.  You can use a credit card, Visa I
think, to access your account by charging items and getting cash advances all
over the world.  It has a limit equal to the account balance in your offshore
account, and the payments to the credit account may be made by the trust
automatically.  The charge for having your trust make the payments is 5% of the
amount or $10, whichever is less.  There is also a minimum account balance of
$1100 to begin the credit account with a $1000 limit, which of course may be
increased, and you get up to three cards free.</p>

<p>The account is numbered and your name is not associated with the account. 
The credit card is "completely confidential, no social security number or
credit information is required."</p>

<title>Libertarian Gift Ideas</title>
</head>
<body>

<img src="/images/reindeer.gif" alt="Happy Holidays" align=right>
<h1>Gift Ideas for Libertarians</h1>

<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/G/KenGaillotJr.html">Ken Gaillot</a>
and <a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Looking for a special gift for a special libertarian? Or perhaps
you'd like to give a freedom-oriented gift that a nonlibertarian would
appreciate? A few practical gift ideas can help make this a happy
holiday for the good boys and girls on your list this Christmas (or Hanukkah,
or winter solstice, or just because!).</p>

<hr><br clear=all>
<h2><img src="/images/candycane.gif" alt="Happy Holidays">Young Children</h2>

<p>Books are a traditional libertarian gift. A wide variety of stories
geared at younger readers have libertarian themes, such as the
<cite>Little House on the Prairie</cite> series ($35.50, set of 9 paperback
vols. from <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LaissezFaire.html">Laissez Faire
Books</a>). Other crowd pleasers include Dr. Seuss' <cite>The Butter Battle
Book</cite> and <cite>Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose</cite>, and traditional
fables and stories such as "The Ant and the Grasshopper" and
"The Little Red Hen."</p>

<p>Another gift popular with children is cold, hard cash. Put it in
a Statue of Liberty piggy bank for greater effect!</p>

<p>Speaking of the Statue, perhaps a Lady Liberty jigsaw puzzle is
just right ($5.95, 500-pc puzzle from
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LibertyTree.html">Liberty Tree</a>).
Or an American history themed deck of cards featuring biographies of
<a href="/revolution/by_name/J/ThomasJefferson.html">Jefferson</a>,
Twain and the like ($12.95 from
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LibertyTree.html">Liberty Tree</a>).</p>

<hr>
<h2><img src="/images/holly.gif" alt="Happy Holidays">Older Children and Teens</h2>

<p>Avid readers will enjoy George Orwell's <cite>Animal Farm</cite>,
<cite>The Diary of Anne Frank</cite>, or science fiction like
Robert Heinlein's <cite>Citizen of the Galaxy</cite>
and <cite>Podkayne of Mars</cite>. The eyes of budding entrepreneurs will
glimmer when they see the moneymaking ideas in
<A href="/revolution/by_name/H/KarlHess.html">Karl Hess'</a> <cite>Capitalism
for Kids</cite> ($9.95, paperback from
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LaissezFaire.html">Laissez Faire Books</a>).</p>

<p>A novel gift is a share of stock in a "cool" company -- M&M Mars,
Disney, Warner Bros., Mattel, etc. If you have an annoyingly leftist
sister-in-law, feel free to send her kids a poster of a cool warbird
in flight along with some McDonnell-Douglas stock!</p>

<p>How about a starter coin collection? An instructive combination is
near-worthless Confederate paper money side-by-side with silver coin from
the same time period.</p>

<p>Hard rock fans will enjoy Rush's <cite>2112</cite> and
<cite>Moving Pictures</cite> compact discs.</p>

<hr>
<h2><img src="/images/ornament.gif" alt="Happy Holidays">Adults</h2>

<p>Give the gift of laughter -- keep them rolling with anything by
Dave Barry (such as <cite>Dave Barry Slept Here</cite>, $12.95,
178pp. paperback, from
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LibertyTree.html">Liberty Tree</a>)
or P.J. O'Rourke (such as <cite>Republican Party Reptile</cite>, $12.95, 250pp.
paperback from
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LibertyTree.html">Liberty Tree</a>).</p>

<p>Browse the fiction section of your favorite bookstore for
Dean Koontz' masterpiece novel <cite>Dark Rivers of the Heart</cite>,
or the self-help section for Objectivist Nathaniel Branden's
<cite>How to Improve Your Self-Esteem</cite>.</p>

<p>The Libertarian Party of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Dallas.html">Dallas</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>,
has an attractive white-on-blue
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a> T-shirt
($15, contact Odie Ellis at 214-690-1127). The shirt has the LP name and
Lady Liberty logo on both sides with the national 1-800 number on the back.</p>

<p>Surprise that historian this year with an authentic Gadsden "Don't Tread
On Me" flag ($32, 3'x5' cotton from Fuffin Flags, 241 Alexander St NW,
Crawfordville, GA 30631).</p>

<p>The heart of the most Grinchian Objectivist will be warmed by a copy of the
1942 Italian film version of Ayn Rand's <cite>We the Living</cite>
($69.95, 2 VHS tapes from
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LaissezFaire.html">Laissez Faire Books</a>).
The Cincinnati <cite>Enquirer</cite> called this film "compelling" and gave
its highest rating of five stars.</p>

<p>Who doesn't want to improve their communication skills? Michael
Emerling Cloud's <cite>The Essence of Political Persuasion</cite> ($27.50,
set of 3 audiotapes from the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/A/ASG.html">Advocates for Self-Government</a>)
will teach your favorite libertarian "intellectual judo."</p>

<p>Are you a Gold Card or a Blue Card? If you know someone who obsessively
fills out magazine surveys, try giving Sandra Hirsh and Jean Kummerow's
<cite>Life Types</cite> ($11.95, 278 pp. paperback from the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/A/ASG.html">Advocates for Self-Government</a>).
Uses the famous Myers-Briggs personality types to address love, leisure
and work.</p>

<p>The businessman on your list will appreciate silk neckties with Thomas
Jefferson or the Statue of Liberty ($29.95 from
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LibertyTree.html">Liberty Tree</a>)
or Ludwig von Mises ($30.00 from the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/Mises.html">Ludwig von Mises Institute</a>).</p>

<p>Two words: coffee mug! Caffeine addicts can satisfy their urges
with a Ludwig von Mises mug ($9.00 from the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/Mises.html">Ludwig von Mises Institute</a>).</p>

<title>Port Watson Promotion Letter</title>
<!-- Place: Port Watson, Clove Cay, Exuma, Bahamas -->
<!-- Time: offer March 1993 -->
</head>

<h1>Port Watson</h1>

<p>March 1993, from Port Watson Ltd. (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:portwatson@firefly.rain.com">portwatson@firefly.rain.com</a>):</p>

<p>Dear Freedom Lover,
     Do you yearn for freedom now?
     Do you ever daydream ... plotting your daring escape from the
faceless bureaucrats and their idiotic edicts?</p>

<p> Imagine, for a moment, your picture of "utopia"...a place
where you are free to be you...with friends and neighbors who share
your views on liberty, individualism, free thought and free
enterprise. </p>

<p> A place where the sun sets and rises on a locale of mutual
acceptance and intellectual emancipation...</p>

<p> A place where your personal lifestyle is your business...</p>

<p> Your very own private tropical paradise where freedom flows
gently through the palms like a tradewind breeze...</p>

<p> Safe, secure, crime-free...yet fun and exciting...</p>

<p> A place which has existed only in our hearts and minds...</p>

<p> ...until now:</p>

<p> We invite you to visit Port Watson where the quality of life
is our first concern...</p>

<p> Located on Clove Cay, Exuma, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Bahamas/">Bahamas</a>, Port Watson
is being created as an intentional community of Free-thinkers, Artists,
Writers, Cybernauts, Philosophers, Computer Professionals, Free-Market Leaders,
and other Interesting Individuals in the midst of
a true tropical island paradise surrounded by the best sailing,
fishing, and diving waters in the world! Conspicuous by their
absence are Cops, Jails, Tax Collectors, and Bureaucrats.</p>

<p> Your neighbors will be adventuresome free-thinkers who
understand freedom and personal responsibility...</p>

<p> Free-spirited intellectuals who share your vision of a
libertarian intentional community...</p>

<p> People like <em>you</em>.</p>

<p> Picture yourself on a hammock between twin palms gently
swaying in the tradewinds' breeze beside a quiet lagoon as
sailboats glide gracefully by.  The water is light green, deep blue
and every imaginable hue in between, yet clear as glass down to the
sand dollars, starfish and colorful shells below...</p>

<p> Or, if you seek the more active lifestyle, water sports abound
in the calm, clear seas surrounding Port Watson. The diving is
rated among the best in The Bahamas, which is to say the best in
the world, and yachtsmen the world over revere the waters for their
unsurpassed clarity and beauty and uninhabited white beaches. </p>

<p> Famous for its abundant fishing, being rich in Blue Marlin, Bonefish,
Tuna, Amberjack and Grouper, Port Watson is a true Deep
Sea Fisherman's dream.</p>

<p> Make your next car a boat!</p>

<p> Whether you plan to become a year-around resident, or decide
to build a vacation home, Port Watson is exclusive, private,
quiet ... for the discerning few who know the value of ocean front
property...</p>

<p> Port Watson at Clove Cay is a rare real estate opportunity
that you can visit, build your dream home on, vacation at, or live
forever with those you love. </p>

<p> In fact, the friendly new free-market government of The
Bahamas is encouraging your emigration...</p>

<p> If you're an interesting person, chances are you fall under
the Group 4 Specialist Category, which means that you qualify for
permanent residence without giving up your U.S. citizenship...all
the benefits of Bahamian citizenship with all the comforts of home.</p>

<p> The Bahamas - the perfect <strong>no-tax</strong> haven...
     No personal or corporate income tax, no sales tax, no capital
gains tax, no withholding tax, no business tax, no estate tax, no
gift tax, no inheritance tax, no death duties, no employment taxes,
no probate fees, (and, in the case of Port Watson, a generous
exemption from property tax.)</p>

<p> Individuals, corporations (including nonresident-controlled
Bahamian corporations), partnerships, trusts, and estates can all
enjoy this immunity!</p>

<p> And, there's more... </p>

<p> ...The Bahama's model bank secrecy laws are the envy of the
world...and the scourge of greedy bureaucrats. The Bahamian secrecy
laws are imposed on all Bank and Trust Companies, their directors,
officers, and employees, attorneys, and auditors. The Bahamas is
not a party to any tax or fiscal information-sharing agreements
(i.e., tax treaties) with any other country. Neither the IRS,
Revenue <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canada</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a>
Inland Revenue, nor any other foreign
principality or power can obtain information about a bank account
you may have in The Bahamas...Once you open an account in The
Bahamas, you are the only one who has the privilege to access it!</p>

<p> Freedom isn't free, but we've made it as low cost as possible.
     Lots start at $20,000 at 10% down/10 years....owner financing
is available! All land sales and transfers are being handled by
Graham Thompson & Co., Sassoon House, Nassau, Bahamas.<p>

<p> We have investigated the cost of materials and local labor,
and can recommend several styles of homes and building materials.
Using state-of-the-art building techniques and materials, your home
could be on-site and up in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p> If you wish, we can arrange the rental of your vacation home
for you. Homes in the area currently rent from $150 to $300 per
night. If you elect to rent out your vacation home through us,
full-time caretakers are available to maintain your home and
grounds during your absence for a small fee, contingent upon rental.  </p>

<p> With an eye toward our goal of reasonable self-sufficiency,
co-ops are being encouraged to meet such needs as energy, food,
communications, etc., to ensure that Port Watsonians enjoy the
comforts of gracious high-tech living. Even co-op housing options
are available as a cost-saving alternative for the budget minded,
and our planned state-of-the-art satellite communications facility
will make telecommuting a comfortable reality for our residents.</p>

<p> We've caught the attention and encouragement of such notables
as Peter Lamborn Wilson, author and editor of Semiotext(e), Robert
Anton Wilson, author of Prometheus Rising, et. al., and Dr. Mary
Ruwart, author of "Healing Our World: The  Other Piece of the
Puzzle," and <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/AndreMarrou.html">Andre
Marrou's</a> first choice as Vice Presidential
running mate. As Dr. Ruwart expressed to us: "A libertarian
community, <em>especially in the Bahamas</em>, is a <em>great</em> idea!"</p>

<p> You see, Port Watson is an Idea Whose Time Has Come.

Cay, Exuma, Bahamas ... <em>and let the adventure begin!</em></p>

<p> Your Visit May Be Tax Deductible!</p>

<title>Port Watson: Addendum</title>
<!-- Place: Port Watson, Clove Cay, Exuma, Bahamas -->
<!-- Time: offer March 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Addendum to Port Watson Promotion Letter</h1>

<p>Having read this far, you have a pretty good idea of what
we're doing at Port Watson, and whether Port Watson sounds like the
place you've been looking for.</p>

<p>We, of Port Watson, know that freedom is precious and
essential to personal growth and prosperity, and this philosophy is
central to our community.</p>

<p>We also know that freedom doesn't just "happen."  It must be
created...</p>

<p>Indeed, we're turning dream into reality, and we're inviting
you to join us!</p>

<p>Those of us who launched this project are totally committed to
its success, and will be living at Port Watson permanently.  We
beckon you to join us in this exciting adventure. Our model of
tolerance, personal liberty and intellectual freedom will be the
paradigm of the consummate intentional community...the very idea of
such an environment is attracting "just the right people," and we'd
like you to be among them. </p>

<p> In addition to having a social atmosphere conducive to
creativity and free trade, we are also developing an economic
environment which will help ensure the project's success. A system
of voluntary cooperatives is being encouraged to take care of such
needs as food, energy, communications, waste-management, consumer
goods and other staples, electronics, toys, education, banking and
investments, and so forth. Your participation in any or all of
these co-ops is, of course, completely voluntary.  Please inquire.</p>

<p> One unique option being offered for those with an eye toward
budget is that of Alternative Co-op Housing. If you're not familiar
with Co-op housing, it works like this: Each family unit (or
individual) owns its own dwelling. This can be either an unattached
cottage or a condo style arrangement. Centrally located is a larger
building which holds a large kitchen, dining hall, and
living/entertaining area. Cooking duties are shared by Co-op
members on a rotational basis ...depending on the size of your Co-
op, your kitchen shift could occur as infrequently as once a
month...this alone makes Co-op housing extremely attractive.
Members of the Co-op housing group can also arrange for child-care
and home schooling options with other members. Co-op housing
members are able to pool their resources to create mega-workshops,
computer LAN systems, or whatever they desire. Co-housing offers a
genuine feeling of community at an affordable price, and is a
logical arrangement for those of you who may be coming on board as
a group. It is very popular in Denmark, and has enjoyed some
success in communities in the United States.</p>

<p> If you prefer conventional housing, many different styles and
materials are obtainable locally, and labor is available in George
Town on nearby Great Exuma. </p>

<p> If you're looking for that special location to build a
vacation or retirement home, rest assured that Port Watson is the
place for you. Vacation homes rent for $150 to $300 per night in
this part of the world, and with the proper listing and promotion
many of those homes stay quite "busy." Your rental profits could be
deposited in your <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Bahamas/">Bahamian</a> bank account,
if you so desire.</p>

<p> Our planned state-of-the-art satellite communications facility
will provide for the transmission of voice/video/data, making
telecommuting a viable option for many residents of Port Watson,
especially writers and individuals involved in the development of
software products.  Most Port Watsonians are computer professionals
who have decided to break free from the bumper-to-bumper chain-gang
choosing, instead, the tranquility of a beach-front paradise as
their office.</p>

<p> If you're an entrepreneur, many excellent opportunities exist
in the form of tourist concessions such as diving, boating,
windsurfing, fishing, food service, tavern, etc., in what is
basically virgin territory. Remember, your Bahamian bank account is
your business. Please inquire.</p>

<p> We are eager to hear from you, and will gladly answer any
questions you may have. The prospects are exciting, paradise
awaits, and the time to embark is now...</p>

<p> Our initial group will consist of fifty people, but in order
to meet our contractual obligations, we must have those fifty
people confirmed within the next sixty days.....so call now.</p>

<p> Those addresses, again, are:</p>

<title>Port Watson Frequently Asked Questions</title>
<!-- Place: Port Watson, Clove Cay, Exuma, Bahamas -->
<!-- Time: offer March 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Port Watson FAQ</h1>

<hr>

<p>Q: Are you starting your own country?</p>

<p>A: No, we are creating an intentional community on a beautiful
privately owned island.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Where is Clove Cay?</p>

<p>A: Clove Cay is an island in the Brigantine Chain of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Bahamas/">The Bahamas</a>,
which  parallels the Exuma Chain. It is a 15 minute boat ride from
Barreterre Island, which is connected by bridge to the northern tip
of Great Exuma. George Town is 45 minutes away by car.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: How do I get there?</p>

<p>A: Several airlines, including American Eagle (800-433-7300) and
Airway International (305-526-3852) have daily flights to George
Town from Miami or <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/FtLauderdale.html">Ft.
Lauderdale</a>. Bahamasair (800-327-8080) flies
to George Town daily from Nassau. Hire a car from George Town north
to Barreterre at the tip of Great Exuma (about 45 minutes) and
onward by boat to Port Watson on Clove Cay (15-20 minutes.) A
representative of Port Watson is living on the island to host
visitors. Your stay will be quite enjoyable. Call Kevin Bloom at
303-442-6256 to make arrangements for your visit.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Must I give up my U.S. citizenship to live at Port Watson?</p>

<p> A: No. U.S. citizens are allowed to stay for up to three months
almost automatically, and renewing is usually very easy. 
Professional skills are in demand in The Bahamas and can get you
Group Four Specialist classification which qualifies you for
Permanent Residence status. Entrepreneurs investing in new
businesses can also obtain permanent residence quite easily.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Do I need a passport or visa to visit Port Watson?</p>

<p> A: U.S. citizens do not need a passport or visa to enter The
Bahamas. You will need two pieces of identification to re-enter the
United States, such as a valid driver's license and a voter
registration stub.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Will we be under Bahamian jurisdiction?</p>

<p>

<p>A: Yes, but don't panic. The Bahamian government does not pester
privately owned islands. One of the most popular resorts, Abaco,
boasts of no police and no jails. There is very little crime in the
Out-islands and, because there are so few taxes, the government has
little reason to meddle in private affairs. The rule of thumb is
that the further away you get from the central government in
Nassau, the less interference you receive. The recently elected
government of The Bahamas leans very strongly toward free-market
principles and is dedicating itself to removing much of the
bureaucracy and restrictions put in place by the former Pindling
administration. Frankly speaking, the Bahamians like our project
and want us there. Taken together, all of these factors should lead
to an environment markedly freer of government interference than is
currently the case in the U.S. or much of the rest of the world.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Are there homes already on the island?</p>

<p>

<p>A: There is one home and several out-buildings, all of which are
currently in use. </p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Is Port Watson, Ltd., acting as developer?</p>

<p> A: Port Watson, Ltd., is not a developer, per se, and is only
subdividing the island and making the lots available to interested 
persons. Each property owner is responsible for developing his or
her own property, including providing water, waste disposal, power,
phone service, and so forth. We are encouraging buyers to form
cooperatives to fill such needs, and are facilitating the formation
of such co-ops; participation by each property owner is strictly
voluntary.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: How long will it take for me to build my home?</p>

<p> A: With today's materials and techniques, your home could be up in
a few weeks.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: What about firearms?</p>

<p> A: Unfortunately, The Bahamas has gone the way of other
Commonwealth nations on that one...better leave them at home.
However, shotgun permits may be obtained. We have Bahamian
attorneys to help in such matters.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Are medical facilities available?</p>

<p> A: Yes. The George Town Medical Clinic has two nurses and one
resident physician less than an hour away.  Also, the Bahamian
government keeps aircraft on standby for Out-island emergencies.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: What about drinking water?</p>

<p> A: Water catchment systems are the norm in the region, and are
generally found to be quite adequate. Also, you may wish to
consider joining or forming a desalination co-op. Port Watson,
Ltd., retains underground water rights to the island.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: What about energy?</p>

<p> A: Most homes in the Out-islands rely on small generators for their
electrical, and bottled gas for cooking. Wind and solar sources are
also becoming popular. You, and your neighbors, may wish to form an
energy co-op utilizing a larger, quieter, more efficient diesel
generator shared among several homes. </p>

<hr>

<p>Q: What about waste management?</p>

<p> A: We are encouraging the use of chemically assisted composting
toilets and other forms of recycling. Your participation in a waste
management and recycling co-op is strongly encouraged.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: How do I go about joining or forming a co-op?</p>

<p> A: Just let us know. We will put you in touch with other Port
Watsonians who share the same interests.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: What about currency?</p>

<p> A: U.S. currency is accepted everywhere, with a value of one to
one. Change is often given using both U.S. and the colorful
Bahamian currency.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Where can I do my banking?</p>

<p> A: Both Barclay's Bank and the Bank of Nova Scotia have George Town
branches.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: The C.I.A. is directing microwaves at my brain in an attempt to
drive me insane, forcing me to wear a tin-foil lined bicycle helmet
at all times, even while sleeping. Will my situation improve if I
move to Port Watson?</p>

<p> A: No.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: What about my plastic?</p>

<p> A: The larger resort towns, such as Nassau and Freeport, accept all
major U.S., <a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a>, and
continental credit cards, as do most
hotels in the Out-islands. Many shops, however, do not, so it's a
good idea to bring along travellers checks, just to be sure.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: How can I support myself on an island? Are any employment
opportunities available?</p>

<p> A: Port Watson offers many opportunities for entrepreneurs in the
form of tourist concessions and support services, as well as a 
planned telecommuting infrastructure ideal for computer
specialists, writers, and other information-age professionals. As
Port Watson grows, so will many other opportunities.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Are there any restrictions on what I can do with my property?</p>

<p> A: Property owners are free to do as they wish with their property,
but may not take anything from or discharge anything onto
neighboring properties without the appropriate owners' permission.
On Clove Cay, property boundaries are clearly defined to prevent
any "tragedies of the commons." Buildings of greater than two
stories are discouraged. Let's all be aware of how our actions are
affecting our neighbors' sunlight, wind, views, etc. Of course, a
group of property owners is free to place voluntary contractual
restrictions on the use of their own properties, if they so desire.</p>

<title>Port Watson Promotion Letter</title>
<!-- Place: Port Watson, Clove Cay, Exuma, Bahamas -->
<!-- Time: offer March 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Port Watson</h1>

<p>March 1993, from Port Watson Ltd. (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:portwatson@firefly.rain.com">portwatson@firefly.rain.com</a>):</p>

<p>Dear Freedom Lover,
     Do you yearn for freedom now?
     Do you ever daydream ... plotting your daring escape from the
faceless bureaucrats and their idiotic edicts?</p>

<p> Imagine, for a moment, your picture of "utopia"...a place
where you are free to be you...with friends and neighbors who share
your views on liberty, individualism, free thought and free
enterprise. </p>

<p> A place where the sun sets and rises on a locale of mutual
acceptance and intellectual emancipation...</p>

<p> A place where your personal lifestyle is your business...</p>

<p> Your very own private tropical paradise where freedom flows
gently through the palms like a tradewind breeze...</p>

<p> Safe, secure, crime-free...yet fun and exciting...</p>

<p> A place which has existed only in our hearts and minds...</p>

<p> ...until now:</p>

<p> We invite you to visit Port Watson where the quality of life
is our first concern...</p>

<p> Located on Clove Cay, Exuma, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Bahamas/">Bahamas</a>, Port Watson
is being created as an intentional community of Free-thinkers, Artists,
Writers, Cybernauts, Philosophers, Computer Professionals, Free-Market Leaders,
and other Interesting Individuals in the midst of
a true tropical island paradise surrounded by the best sailing,
fishing, and diving waters in the world! Conspicuous by their
absence are Cops, Jails, Tax Collectors, and Bureaucrats.</p>

<p> Your neighbors will be adventuresome free-thinkers who
understand freedom and personal responsibility...</p>

<p> Free-spirited intellectuals who share your vision of a
libertarian intentional community...</p>

<p> People like <em>you</em>.</p>

<p> Picture yourself on a hammock between twin palms gently
swaying in the tradewinds' breeze beside a quiet lagoon as
sailboats glide gracefully by.  The water is light green, deep blue
and every imaginable hue in between, yet clear as glass down to the
sand dollars, starfish and colorful shells below...</p>

<p> Or, if you seek the more active lifestyle, water sports abound
in the calm, clear seas surrounding Port Watson. The diving is
rated among the best in The Bahamas, which is to say the best in
the world, and yachtsmen the world over revere the waters for their
unsurpassed clarity and beauty and uninhabited white beaches. </p>

<p> Famous for its abundant fishing, being rich in Blue Marlin, Bonefish,
Tuna, Amberjack and Grouper, Port Watson is a true Deep
Sea Fisherman's dream.</p>

<p> Make your next car a boat!</p>

<p> Whether you plan to become a year-around resident, or decide
to build a vacation home, Port Watson is exclusive, private,
quiet ... for the discerning few who know the value of ocean front
property...</p>

<p> Port Watson at Clove Cay is a rare real estate opportunity
that you can visit, build your dream home on, vacation at, or live
forever with those you love. </p>

<p> In fact, the friendly new free-market government of The
Bahamas is encouraging your emigration...</p>

<p> If you're an interesting person, chances are you fall under
the Group 4 Specialist Category, which means that you qualify for
permanent residence without giving up your U.S. citizenship...all
the benefits of Bahamian citizenship with all the comforts of home.</p>

<p> The Bahamas - the perfect <strong>no-tax</strong> haven...
     No personal or corporate income tax, no sales tax, no capital
gains tax, no withholding tax, no business tax, no estate tax, no
gift tax, no inheritance tax, no death duties, no employment taxes,
no probate fees, (and, in the case of Port Watson, a generous
exemption from property tax.)</p>

<p> Individuals, corporations (including nonresident-controlled
Bahamian corporations), partnerships, trusts, and estates can all
enjoy this immunity!</p>

<p> And, there's more... </p>

<p> ...The Bahama's model bank secrecy laws are the envy of the
world...and the scourge of greedy bureaucrats. The Bahamian secrecy
laws are imposed on all Bank and Trust Companies, their directors,
officers, and employees, attorneys, and auditors. The Bahamas is
not a party to any tax or fiscal information-sharing agreements
(i.e., tax treaties) with any other country. Neither the IRS,
Revenue <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canada</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a>
Inland Revenue, nor any other foreign
principality or power can obtain information about a bank account
you may have in The Bahamas...Once you open an account in The
Bahamas, you are the only one who has the privilege to access it!</p>

<p> Freedom isn't free, but we've made it as low cost as possible.
     Lots start at $20,000 at 10% down/10 years....owner financing
is available! All land sales and transfers are being handled by
Graham Thompson & Co., Sassoon House, Nassau, Bahamas.<p>

<p> We have investigated the cost of materials and local labor,
and can recommend several styles of homes and building materials.
Using state-of-the-art building techniques and materials, your home
could be on-site and up in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p> If you wish, we can arrange the rental of your vacation home
for you. Homes in the area currently rent from $150 to $300 per
night. If you elect to rent out your vacation home through us,
full-time caretakers are available to maintain your home and
grounds during your absence for a small fee, contingent upon rental.  </p>

<p> With an eye toward our goal of reasonable self-sufficiency,
co-ops are being encouraged to meet such needs as energy, food,
communications, etc., to ensure that Port Watsonians enjoy the
comforts of gracious high-tech living. Even co-op housing options
are available as a cost-saving alternative for the budget minded,
and our planned state-of-the-art satellite communications facility
will make telecommuting a comfortable reality for our residents.</p>

<p> We've caught the attention and encouragement of such notables
as Peter Lamborn Wilson, author and editor of Semiotext(e), Robert
Anton Wilson, author of Prometheus Rising, et. al., and Dr. Mary
Ruwart, author of "Healing Our World: The  Other Piece of the
Puzzle," and <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/AndreMarrou.html">Andre
Marrou's</a> first choice as Vice Presidential
running mate. As Dr. Ruwart expressed to us: "A libertarian
community, <em>especially in the Bahamas</em>, is a <em>great</em> idea!"</p>

<p> You see, Port Watson is an Idea Whose Time Has Come.
     For itinerary and more information contact Kevin Bloom, of
Port Watson Ltd, 303-442-6256 (11 AM to 6 PM Mountain Time) or

<p> <strong>Visit Port Watson,</strong> the intentional community at Clove
Cay, Exuma, Bahamas ... <em>and let the adventure begin!</em></p>

<p> Your Visit May Be Tax Deductible!</p>

<p> This offer of freedom void where prohibited by law or similar inanity.</p>

<p> Sincerely Yours,<br>
Benjamin Hamilton Power,<br>
Secretary-Treasurer<br>
Port Watson, Ltd.<br>

<p>Having read this far, you have a pretty good idea of what
we're doing at Port Watson, and whether Port Watson sounds like the
place you've been looking for.</p>

<p>We, of Port Watson, know that freedom is precious and
essential to personal growth and prosperity, and this philosophy is
central to our community.</p>

<p>We also know that freedom doesn't just "happen."  It must be
created...</p>

<p>Indeed, we're turning dream into reality, and we're inviting
you to join us!</p>

<p>Those of us who launched this project are totally committed to
its success, and will be living at Port Watson permanently.  We
beckon you to join us in this exciting adventure. Our model of
tolerance, personal liberty and intellectual freedom will be the
paradigm of the consummate intentional community...the very idea of
such an environment is attracting "just the right people," and we'd
like you to be among them. </p>

<p> In addition to having a social atmosphere conducive to
creativity and free trade, we are also developing an economic
environment which will help ensure the project's success. A system
of voluntary cooperatives is being encouraged to take care of such
needs as food, energy, communications, waste-management, consumer
goods and other staples, electronics, toys, education, banking and
investments, and so forth. Your participation in any or all of
these co-ops is, of course, completely voluntary.  Please inquire.</p>

<p> One unique option being offered for those with an eye toward
budget is that of Alternative Co-op Housing. If you're not familiar
with Co-op housing, it works like this: Each family unit (or
individual) owns its own dwelling. This can be either an unattached
cottage or a condo style arrangement. Centrally located is a larger
building which holds a large kitchen, dining hall, and
living/entertaining area. Cooking duties are shared by Co-op
members on a rotational basis ...depending on the size of your Co-
op, your kitchen shift could occur as infrequently as once a
month...this alone makes Co-op housing extremely attractive.
Members of the Co-op housing group can also arrange for child-care
and home schooling options with other members. Co-op housing
members are able to pool their resources to create mega-workshops,
computer LAN systems, or whatever they desire. Co-housing offers a
genuine feeling of community at an affordable price, and is a
logical arrangement for those of you who may be coming on board as
a group. It is very popular in Denmark, and has enjoyed some
success in communities in the United States.</p>

<p> If you prefer conventional housing, many different styles and
materials are obtainable locally, and labor is available in George
Town on nearby Great Exuma. </p>

<p> If you're looking for that special location to build a
vacation or retirement home, rest assured that Port Watson is the
place for you. Vacation homes rent for $150 to $300 per night in
this part of the world, and with the proper listing and promotion
many of those homes stay quite "busy." Your rental profits could be
deposited in your <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Bahamas/">Bahamian</a> bank account,
if you so desire.</p>

<p> Our planned state-of-the-art satellite communications facility
will provide for the transmission of voice/video/data, making
telecommuting a viable option for many residents of Port Watson,
especially writers and individuals involved in the development of
software products.  Most Port Watsonians are computer professionals
who have decided to break free from the bumper-to-bumper chain-gang
choosing, instead, the tranquility of a beach-front paradise as
their office.</p>

<p> If you're an entrepreneur, many excellent opportunities exist
in the form of tourist concessions such as diving, boating,
windsurfing, fishing, food service, tavern, etc., in what is
basically virgin territory. Remember, your Bahamian bank account is
your business. Please inquire.</p>

<p> We are eager to hear from you, and will gladly answer any
questions you may have. The prospects are exciting, paradise
awaits, and the time to embark is now...</p>

<p> Our initial group will consist of fifty people, but in order
to meet our contractual obligations, we must have those fifty
people confirmed within the next sixty days.....so call now.</p>

<p> Those addresses, again, are:</p>

<title>Port Watson Frequently Asked Questions</title>
<!-- Place: Port Watson, Clove Cay, Exuma, Bahamas -->
<!-- Time: offer March 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Port Watson FAQ</h1>

<hr>

<p>Q: Are you starting your own country?</p>

<p>A: No, we are creating an intentional community on a beautiful
privately owned island.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Where is Clove Cay?</p>

<p>A: Clove Cay is an island in the Brigantine Chain of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Bahamas/">The Bahamas</a>,
which  parallels the Exuma Chain. It is a 15 minute boat ride from
Barreterre Island, which is connected by bridge to the northern tip
of Great Exuma. George Town is 45 minutes away by car.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: How do I get there?</p>

<p>A: Several airlines, including American Eagle (800-433-7300) and
Airway International (305-526-3852) have daily flights to George
Town from Miami or <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/FtLauderdale.html">Ft.
Lauderdale</a>. Bahamasair (800-327-8080) flies
to George Town daily from Nassau. Hire a car from George Town north
to Barreterre at the tip of Great Exuma (about 45 minutes) and
onward by boat to Port Watson on Clove Cay (15-20 minutes.) A
representative of Port Watson is living on the island to host
visitors. Your stay will be quite enjoyable. Call Kevin Bloom at
303-442-6256 to make arrangements for your visit.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Must I give up my U.S. citizenship to live at Port Watson?</p>

<p> A: No. U.S. citizens are allowed to stay for up to three months
almost automatically, and renewing is usually very easy. 
Professional skills are in demand in The Bahamas and can get you
Group Four Specialist classification which qualifies you for
Permanent Residence status. Entrepreneurs investing in new
businesses can also obtain permanent residence quite easily.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Do I need a passport or visa to visit Port Watson?</p>

<p> A: U.S. citizens do not need a passport or visa to enter The
Bahamas. You will need two pieces of identification to re-enter the
United States, such as a valid driver's license and a voter
registration stub.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Will we be under Bahamian jurisdiction?</p>

<p>

<p>A: Yes, but don't panic. The Bahamian government does not pester
privately owned islands. One of the most popular resorts, Abaco,
boasts of no police and no jails. There is very little crime in the
Out-islands and, because there are so few taxes, the government has
little reason to meddle in private affairs. The rule of thumb is
that the further away you get from the central government in
Nassau, the less interference you receive. The recently elected
government of The Bahamas leans very strongly toward free-market
principles and is dedicating itself to removing much of the
bureaucracy and restrictions put in place by the former Pindling
administration. Frankly speaking, the Bahamians like our project
and want us there. Taken together, all of these factors should lead
to an environment markedly freer of government interference than is
currently the case in the U.S. or much of the rest of the world.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Are there homes already on the island?</p>

<p>

<p>A: There is one home and several out-buildings, all of which are
currently in use. </p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Is Port Watson, Ltd., acting as developer?</p>

<p> A: Port Watson, Ltd., is not a developer, per se, and is only
subdividing the island and making the lots available to interested 
persons. Each property owner is responsible for developing his or
her own property, including providing water, waste disposal, power,
phone service, and so forth. We are encouraging buyers to form
cooperatives to fill such needs, and are facilitating the formation
of such co-ops; participation by each property owner is strictly
voluntary.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: How long will it take for me to build my home?</p>

<p> A: With today's materials and techniques, your home could be up in
a few weeks.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: What about firearms?</p>

<p> A: Unfortunately, The Bahamas has gone the way of other
Commonwealth nations on that one...better leave them at home.
However, shotgun permits may be obtained. We have Bahamian
attorneys to help in such matters.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Are medical facilities available?</p>

<p> A: Yes. The George Town Medical Clinic has two nurses and one
resident physician less than an hour away.  Also, the Bahamian
government keeps aircraft on standby for Out-island emergencies.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: What about drinking water?</p>

<p> A: Water catchment systems are the norm in the region, and are
generally found to be quite adequate. Also, you may wish to
consider joining or forming a desalination co-op. Port Watson,
Ltd., retains underground water rights to the island.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: What about energy?</p>

<p> A: Most homes in the Out-islands rely on small generators for their
electrical, and bottled gas for cooking. Wind and solar sources are
also becoming popular. You, and your neighbors, may wish to form an
energy co-op utilizing a larger, quieter, more efficient diesel
generator shared among several homes. </p>

<hr>

<p>Q: What about waste management?</p>

<p> A: We are encouraging the use of chemically assisted composting
toilets and other forms of recycling. Your participation in a waste
management and recycling co-op is strongly encouraged.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: How do I go about joining or forming a co-op?</p>

<p> A: Just let us know. We will put you in touch with other Port
Watsonians who share the same interests.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: What about currency?</p>

<p> A: U.S. currency is accepted everywhere, with a value of one to
one. Change is often given using both U.S. and the colorful
Bahamian currency.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Where can I do my banking?</p>

<p> A: Both Barclay's Bank and the Bank of Nova Scotia have George Town
branches.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: The C.I.A. is directing microwaves at my brain in an attempt to
drive me insane, forcing me to wear a tin-foil lined bicycle helmet
at all times, even while sleeping. Will my situation improve if I
move to Port Watson?</p>

<p> A: No.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: What about my plastic?</p>

<p> A: The larger resort towns, such as Nassau and Freeport, accept all
major U.S., <a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a>, and
continental credit cards, as do most
hotels in the Out-islands. Many shops, however, do not, so it's a
good idea to bring along travellers checks, just to be sure.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: How can I support myself on an island? Are any employment
opportunities available?</p>

<p> A: Port Watson offers many opportunities for entrepreneurs in the
form of tourist concessions and support services, as well as a 
planned telecommuting infrastructure ideal for computer
specialists, writers, and other information-age professionals. As
Port Watson grows, so will many other opportunities.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q: Are there any restrictions on what I can do with my property?</p>

<p> A: Property owners are free to do as they wish with their property,
but may not take anything from or discharge anything onto
neighboring properties without the appropriate owners' permission.
On Clove Cay, property boundaries are clearly defined to prevent
any "tragedies of the commons." Buildings of greater than two
stories are discouraged. Let's all be aware of how our actions are
affecting our neighbors' sunlight, wind, views, etc. Of course, a
group of property owners is free to place voluntary contractual
restrictions on the use of their own properties, if they so desire.</p>

<title>Exploration and Government</title>

<h1>Space Exploration: Bureaucracy or Reality?</h1>

<p>By <a href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWalker.html">Bill Walker</a></p>

<p>On July 20, 1969, an American stepped out of a crude spacecraft onto the
surface of the Moon. It has now been twenty-six years since that "one small
step". Far from heralding the era of space exploration and colonization
promised by presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon, the moon voyages now seem
to have been a dead end. Not only have we not progressed to building
moonbases, space stations or missions to Mars, America no longer has any
spacecraft capable of voyaging to the Moon.</p>

<p>What went wrong with the dream? Surprisingly, the answer to this space age
riddle can be found in history.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that a large nation has turned inward and
abandoned its age of exploration. Though it is little known except among
historians, <a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europeans</a> were not
the first to go in search of "New Worlds". The
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/China/">Chinese</a> Emperor Yongle had
launched his fleets toward
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Africa/">Africa</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/India/">India</a> long
before.</p>

<p>In 1405, the eunuch admiral Zheng He set forth with a fleet of 317 ships
crewed by 27,870 men. Their two-year mission:  to seek out new life forms and
new civilizations (and make them submit to the Emperor). Between 1405 and
1431, the exploration fleets made seven major voyages, traveling to India,
Ceylon, the Persian Gulf, and East Africa. They brought back curiosities such
as zebras, ostriches, and giraffes (and the king of Ceylon, who did not
appreciate their visit). They also distributed lavish foreign aid on those
princes who swore fealty to the Chinese Emperor.</p>

<p>Then, they stopped. The entire program was shut down. The mighty shipyards
no longer produced long-range vessels. Ownership of oceangoing ships was
forbidden to Chinese citizens. Foreign trade of any kind was discouraged,
whether by land or sea. In 1479, the War Ministry destroyed the official
records of the journeys. Chinese exploration might never have happened, for
all its effect on future generations.</p>

<p>European exploration got off to a later start, on a shoestring compared to
the Imperial budgets of the Chinese. The Europeans did not succeed because of
superior ship technology, either. Zheng He's exploration vessels had
compasses, stern post rudders, and multiple watertight compartments. Scholars
estimate the largest of the vessels were over 400 feet long, and displaced up
to 3,000 tons. (The Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria of 1492 are thought to have
been smaller than 100 tons; they could have served as lifeboats for Zheng
He).</p>

<p>Yet the European exploration was no dead end. It quickly spread both the
good and the bad of European culture around the globe. Exotic products poured
back into European ports. Scientific knowledge exploded. European colonists
left to pursue their dreams of freedom (or their peculiar forms of
repression, in some cases) on new continents months' voyages away from their
kings.</p>

<p>The difference between European and Chinese exploration was simple. Chinese
explorations were huge government projects whose goal was prestige (and
perhaps shipbuilding contracts for the politically favored?). They were not
followed by traders or settlers, because the Emperors valued control over
their subjects' lives above all else. The Emperors did not believe in
individual rights or private property apart from that granted by the
all-powerful state. The Chinese Age of Exploration was founded squarely on
the ideal of government control of- everything.</p>

<p>European explorations were often funded by governments. But they were
followed rapidly by traders and colonists. Private property and trade built
the economic strength of the English colonies. Even those who came to the New
World to create planned societies, like the Pilgrims, ended up adopting free
enterprise instead.</p>

<p>European governments tried to limit the independence of their colonies, and
failed. Eventually some of these colonies broke away from the whole idea of
kings, and became the United States. But have we really advanced so far from
Emperor Yongle, and his quest for government prestige?</p>

<p>If we look at the American space program without the mist of sentiment, we
see that it looks more like the huge, bureaucratic Chinese program than the
decentralized Europeans. Zheng He would feel right at home in NASA. NASA is
huge budgets, giant government programs aimed toward prestige goals, and no
lowly entrepreneurs. And most critical of all, there is no provision for
private property in space. </p>

<p>NASA has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on exploration and research.
Many possible space industries have been identified, ranging from asteroid
mining to vaccine production. But no company can invest where there are no
property rights. If the dream of space colonization is ever to be realized,
investors and homesteaders must be able to own Moon real estate, asteroids,
orbit slots, and space stations. </p>

<p>NASA will never be able to create the enormous and complicated
infrastructure needed for space development. If we have learned anything from
the collapse of the Soviet Union, it is that there is no substitute for the
market system. Until spaceships can count on being able to refuel at Joe's
Deuterium & Lube, space travel will remain a waste dump for government's
excess cash (or should I say excess debt?).</p>

<p>Newt Gingrich has said that he wants to see America return to the Moon to
stay, with a permanent base. He doesn't need to boost NASA's budget. All he
has to do is allow Americans to extend the American system of private
property rights to the new frontier.  And then future generations can read
Neil Armstrong's heroism as a preface to a new age, instead of a pathetic
footnote to some other nation's dreams made real. </p>

<title>Illinois Ballot Access</title>
<!-- Place: Illinois (USA) -->
<!-- Time: February 7, 1996 -->
</head>
<body>

<h1>Court Denies Local Ballot Access</h1>

<p>On February 7, 1996, the federal court in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a> denied ballot
access to the <a href="index.html">Libertarian Party of Illinois</a>
in local races even though the party had won statewide ballot access.</p>

<p>As a result of the November 1994 general election, the LP-Illinois
became an "established party" under the Illinois Election Code. The state
board of elections at first confirmed LP-Illinois could participate in
the primary election for all statewide and local offices, in a December 13,
1994 letter from A. L. Zimmer, General Counsel of the State Board of
Elections to Andrew Spiegel, General Counsel of LP-Illinois.</p>

<p>Shortly after confirming the established party status of LP-Illinois, the
state board changed its mind and determined LP-Illinois could only run
candidates in statewide races. Reversal of their previous confirmation
came in a December 19, 1994 letter from Zimmer to Spiegel.</p>

<p>In <cite>Libertarian Party of Illinois, et al., vs. Wanda L. Rednour,
et al.</cite>, the LP-Illinois argued that certain state ballot access
requirements were unconstitutional. The state argued the restrictions were
necessary to prevent "voter confusion," that the addition of Libertarian
candidates would "clutter" the ballot, and that it was constitutional
to require LP-Illinois candidates to obtain over ten times the number
of signatures required of Republican and Democratic candidates.</p>

<p>In February 1996, the court agreed with the state. Libertarian candidates
may be listed on the ballot for statewide races (President and U.S. Senate
in 1996), but not for local races (including Congressional and state
legislature races in 1996). Candidates for local races must petition to
be on the ballot as if they were candidates of a newly formed party.
LP-Illinois is deciding whether to appeal the decision.</p>

<p>Oh, God forbid the voters have a real choice, that would <em>clutter
the ballot</em>. We can't let voters <em>really</em> decide who gets
elected; they're too easily confused. It's just so embarassing when
a new party overcomes the obstacles placed in front of ballot access;
we didn't really mean we'd let you on the ballot. Sorry, we changed
the rules.</p>

<title>Coon for State House</title>
<!-- Place: -->
<!-- Time: -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Jon Coon for State House</h1>

<p>One of 1996's most promising Libertarian campaigns was
Jon Coon's race for State Representative in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan's</a>
24th District. Building on the contacts and name recognition gained by his
<a href="joncoon/">1994 U.S. Senate campaign</a>, Coon gained the
endorsement of the NRA, ran radio ads for the
<a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/election/1996/browne/">Harry
Browne campaign</a>, out-spent and out-campaigned his opponent, and
sent campaign videos to every registered voter in the district.</p>

<p>Coon came in a distant second, with 4,942 votes (15.4%), ahead of
the Republican but behind the five-term Democractic incumbent.</p>

<h2>NRA Endorses Libertarian</h2>

<p>In September 1996, the <a href="index.html">Libertarian Party of Michigan</a>
announced that the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">National Rifle Association</a>
had endorsed Coon. The NRA sent out "voter alert" postcards
to all its members in the 24th district announcing the endorsement.</p>

<p>This was the first time the NRA endorsed a Libertarian
candidate for state office in Michigan.</p>

<h2>State Party Runs Radio Ads</h2>

<p>The <a href="index.html">Libertarian Party of Michigan</a> Campaign Fund
raised $10,000 to support the Browne for President campaign with radio
commercials. The party purchased one spot per show per day on virtually all
of the talk radio stations in the state in late October and early November.</p>

<p>The party ran three ads, two produced by the Harry Browne campaign
and one specially produced, and narrated by Jon Coon. The Coon ad was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>COON:</b> For far too long now the two older parties have whipsawed us
into voting for "the lesser of two evils" by claiming that casting your ballot
for anyone else was "wasting your vote."  Hi, I'm Jon Coon, here to tell you
that the time has come to put an end to this by voting for Harry Browne, the
Libertarian party candidate for president.  By voting for Harry you do two
things.  First, you send a message that you want less government.  Not
government that doesn't grow as fast.  Less government.  And, second, if
enough people vote for Harry Browne, we will make the Libertarian party a
major party in Michigan and end the two-party stranglehold.  So, ask
yourself.  Do you want Clinton's 20% increase in government?  Dole's 14%
increase in government?  Or do you want what Browne calls his "great trade":</p>

<p><b>BROWNE:</b> "Would you give up your favorite federal programs if it meant
you'd never have to pay income tax again?  I'm Harry Browne, Libertarian
candidate for president."</p>

<p><b>COON:</b> To me, the choice is clear.</p>

<p><b>BOOTH:</b> Paid for by the Libertarian Party of Michigan Campaign
Fund.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Campaign Video</h2>

<p>At a cost of $10,000, the Jon Coon campaign produced a professional
eighteen minute campaign video created mostly from a three-camera shoot
of a speech Jon made at a campaign-sponsored Town Hall meeting in
August 1995. The campaign made 23,000 copies of the video at a cost of
$20,000.</p>

<p>The last weekend in October, in a monumental effort reported in the local
media, the "Coon Platoon" of nearly 100 volunteers delivered a copy of
this video to every registered voter household in the district, except
apartment buildings. The campaign mailed videos to much of the remaining
apartment addresses.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>Of interest is how the campaign was run. From the campaign's advertising
director, Tim O'Brien:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We decided early on that we would not run on "issues." Neither major party
runs on issues ...  Further, Libertarian positions on most issues are,
at least, apparently, very radical.  Our goal was not to spend our time,
effort and money in a (very likely futile) attempt to educate the public
on the efficacy of libertarian ideas but, rather, to get Jon Coon elected.</p>

<p>... Our strategy was to take the high road.  No personal attacks on
Palamara. In fact, we conceded that he was nice guy.  But because he belongs
to one of those two major parties, <em>he</em> is impotent to get anything
done.  It was the simple and easily understood message that the two party
system has become the problem because special interest groups have discovered
they can get whatever they want by simply contributing to both sides. And
that <em>only</em> a third party -- without political debts -- can solve
this problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The national Libertarian Party supported and promoted the Coon
campaign as one of the winnable campaigns of the season. There have been
postmortem criticisms of this strategy, the main ones being concerned
with running against a five-term incumbent in a "safe"
one-party district and avoiding hard-code libertarian issues.</p>

<h1>1996 Libertarian Campaigns</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>All in all, 1996 was a banner year for the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>.
The party set new membership and candidate records, built upon its
base of support, and saw its ideas included in mainstream politics
like never before in this century.</p>

<p>In the <a href="browne/">presidential race</a>, the Libertarian ticket
of Harry Browne and Jo Jorgensen received 485,120 votes (0.5% of the
total). This is the second-best Libertarian showing ever. The L.P. became
the first third party ever to be on all fifty state ballots two presidential
elections in a row.</p>

<p>In an election season widely characterized as boring, voter turnout was
the lowest since 1824, at 49%. However, minor parties were exceptionally
strong, with more candidates on the ballot than usual and stronger minor
candidates for President than usual.</p>

<p>Highlights:</p>
<dl>
<p>
<dt><strong>Winning campaigns.</strong></dt>
<dd>The party's number of appointed and elected officeholders topped
170 even before the November elections. From <a href="early.html">January
to April 1996</a>, nearly twenty Libertarians were elected or appointed
to various nonpartisan offices. In November, two Libertarians were
re-elected to nonpartisan office in California (one to a utilities district
board and one as a county supervisor).</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong><a href="senate.html">Senate races.</a></strong></dt>
<dd>The LP's best results were Ken Blevens's 4% showing in New Hampshire
and Jack Cashin's 4% in Georgia. Both of those races held the balance of
power, which often gives the state affiliate bargaining power in future
political decisions.</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong><a href="governors.html">Governors races.</a></strong></dt>
<dd>Wallace Johnson's 3% showing in West Virginia earns major party status
in that state, one of the toughest for ballot access.</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong><a href="house.html">U.S. House races.</a></strong></dt>
<dd>Best results were Richard Eaton's 25% in Maine, Robert Anderson's 6%
in Arizona and Emil Rossi's 7% in California. Eaton's was a two-way race,
and each of the others held the balance of power.</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>Other partisan races.</strong></dt>
<dd>The best results that I have so far are Karen Benson's 34% county
council showing in Indiana, Richard Eaton's 25% showing
for Maine State Representative and Carol Hill's 22% for
county commission in Colorado. Quite a few candidates received between
15% and 20% for various state level races (state house, state senate
and state supreme court).</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>Other nonpartisan races.</strong></dt>
<dd>Two Libertarians were re-elected to county and local office in
California. A Libertarian came in second with 33% for Colorado Regional
Transportation District.</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>Other important facts for the party.</strong></dt>
<dd>The party ran a record 775 candidates in the November elections,
including 170 for Congress. Paid membership doubled from '94 to '96 to
record levels.  Libertarian candidates received
<a href="endorsements.html">endorsements</a> from a wide range of groups.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The year was not entirely cheery for libertarians, however. Many
libertarians expected Browne to get close to 1%, and the Party lost
ballot status in four states -- New Hampshire, Hawaii, Illinois
and Massachusetts -- while gaining it in only one, West Virginia.
Increased competition from other minor party candidates resulted in lower
average vote totals.</p>

<title>Astrophysicist Busted</title>
<!-- Place: resident of Tucson, Arizona (USA) -->

<h1>Astrophysicist gets 5 years for first pot offense</h1>

<p>Steven Pearce, an astrophysicist and <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canadian</a> citizen, was
sentenced to a mandatory minimum of five years in prison for attempting to
transport forty pounds of marijuana.</p>

<p>Pearce completed his Ph.D. at the University of Arizona at
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/Tucson.html">Tucson</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a>, where
he worked with Dr. Eugene Levy at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. He has
authored and co-authored many scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals.</p>

<p>On September 8, 1993, Pearce was arrested for transporting 40 pounds of
marijuana. He was trying to make enough money to pay child support he owed.
The nonviolent crime was Pearce's first offense.</p>

<p>Under mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines, the judge was forced to
sentence Pearce to five years of prison, two years of supervised probation,
1000 hours of community service and a $15,000 fine. Pearce will be
deported when he is released.</p>

<p>Pearce's probation officer and judge both believed Pearce should get a
lesser sentence, but were unable to alter the mandatory minimum. The judge
granted Pearce an unsupervised five-month stay of execution of sentence to
allow him to complete his dissertation, and later extended the stay another
five months.</p>

<p>On August 25, 1995, Pearce will enter prison.</p>

<title>Ruby Ridge Aftermath</title>
<!-- Place: Ruby Ridge, Idaho (USA) -->
<!-- Time: investigation July 1993;
	settlement August 15, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Aftermath of Ruby Ridge</h1>

<p>The FBI and BATF received harsh criticism after the <a
href="setup.html">set-up</a> and <a href="siege.html">military siege</a>
of a rural <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/id/">Idaho</a> family. In the
siege, federal agents killed Randy Weaver's dog, son and wife.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Justice Department Report</h2>

<p>The <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/wbardwel/public/nfalist/ruby.ridge1">Justice
Department's own 542-page report</a> on the incident recommended criminal
prosecution. The report found that FBI agents violated agency guidelines
and overstepped Constitutional Fourth Amendment protections.</p>

<p>The Justice Department began investigating the matter in July 1993 after
Weaver was <a href="trial.html">acquitted</a> of weapons and murder charges.
The final report said the FBI's Rules of Engagement for the Ruby Ridge
incident "contravened the Consititution of the United States" and "encouraged
the use of deadly force."</p>

<hr>

<h2>FBI Disciplinary Actions</h2>

<p>Deval Patrick, the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, and
<a href="/revolution/by_name/F/LouisFreeh.html">Louis Freeh</a>, Director of
the FBI, took no serious action.</p>

<p>Larry Potts was the senior official in charge of the operation. Not only
was he not prosecuted, Freeh promoted him to acting deputy FBI director.
After two months, controversy over Potts' role in Ruby Ridge prompted Freeh
to remove him from the position.</p>

<p>A total of twelve agents were disciplined. None have yet been prosecuted.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Civil Suit</h2>

<p>On August 15, 1995, the U.S. Department of Justice agreed to pay $3.1
million to the family of Randy Weaver. Weaver will receive $100,000,
while each of Vicki Weaver's surviving three children will receive $1
million.</p>

<p>The Weavers had sought $200 million in civil suits filed against the
federal government.</p>

<title>Another Record Bust</title>
<!-- Time: August 1995 -->
<!-- Place: Pacific Ocean near Peru -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Another Record Cocaine Bust</h1>

<p>In August 1995, U.S. officials seized twelve tons of cocaine from a
Panamanian freighter, charging ten Colombian crewmen with possession
with intent to distribute. The seizure was a yet another new record amount
of cocaine siezed on the high seas.</p>

<p>Apparently believing the United States is suffering a shortage of
domestic criminals, the U.S. Navy decided to import some from South
America. A Navy cruiser, encountering the <i>Nataly I</i> nearly eight
hundred miles west of Peru, called the U.S. Coast Guard, which found
evidence of cocaine during a "consensual" boarding.</p>

<p>How many more record busts have to occur to show prohibitionists that the
drug supply can't be stopped?</p>

<title>Senate criticizes FBI</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: hearings September 6 - 14, 1995;
	report December 21, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Senate criticizes federal law enforcement</h1>

<h2>Hearings</h2>

<p>From September 6 to September 14, 1995, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee
held hearings relating to the <a href="index.html">Ruby Ridge siege</a>.</p>

<p>Questioned about his extreme racial views, Weaver admitted he was a
white separatist: "I'm not a
hateful racist as most people understand it. I believe that if there is
separation of races, scripturally speaking, that's what I believe is right."</p>

<p>As reported in the <cite>News and Observer</cite>:
<blockquote>
<p>"On Aug. 21, 1992, federal marshals shot my son Samuel in the back and
killed him. He was running home to me. His last words were, 'I'm coming
dad,'" Weaver said.</p>

<p>On the killing of his wife, Weaver said, "She was not wanted for any crime.
There were no warrants for her arrest. At the time she was gunned down, she was
helpless. She was standing in the doorway of her home."</p>

<p>His voice broke as he described his wife slumping to the floor, their
10-month-old daughter still in her arms. Weeping in the audience was his oldest
daughter, Sara, who also was to testify.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"If I had it to do over again, knowing what I know now, I would make
different choices," Weaver said. "I would come down from the mountain for the
court appearance."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lon Horiuchi, the FBI sniper who killed Weaver's wife, refused to
answer the Senate panel's questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment rights.
Horiuchi's lawyer recommended that Horiuchi not testify because an Idaho
prosecutor is considering criminal charges against Horiuchi.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Report</h2>

<p>On December 21, the U.S. Senate Judiciary subcommittee on terrorism
released its <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><A
href="http://www.nra.org/pub/general/96-02-02_senate_report_on_ruby_ridge/">report
on the Ruby Ridge standoff</a> between Randy Weaver's
family and the FBI. The panel concluded that FBI sniper Lon Horiuchi's
shot that killed Vicki Weaver was illegal and violated her civil rights.</p>

<p>The panel criticized FBI Director <a
href="/revolution/by_name/F/LouisFreeh.html">Louis J. Freeh's</a>
"questionable judgement" in promoting Larry Potts after reprimanding him
for his role in the incident. Potts and four other top FBI officials
have been suspended while a federal criminal probe investigates the
destruction of documents related to the incident.</p>

<p>The focal point of the Senate's criticism is the FBI's "Hostage Rescue
Team," which originally only operated in foreign countries, is overtly
militaristic and aggressive, and is used in situations where there are
no hostages to be rescued.</p>

<p>The panel also criticized the U.S. Marshals service and the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) for their roles, saying,
"While Randy Weaver made mistakes, so did every federal law enforcement
agency involved in the Ruby Ridge incident."</p>

<title>Tobacco Ads in Canada</title>
<!-- Place: Canada -->
<!-- Time: September 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Canadian Court Ends Ad Restrictions</h1>

<p>In September 1995, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canada's</a> Supreme Court
struck down Canadian regulations
limiting the advertising and promotion of tobacco products, on free speech
grounds. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the Tobacco
Products Control Act of 1988 is "not justifiable under the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms."</p>

<p>Federal Canadian regulations had banned tobacco ads in newspapers and
magazines, required warning labels on cigarette packs and restricted
tobacco company sponsorship of events.</p>

<p>In a fit of pique, a cancer society spokesman said, "I don't see how the
freedom of expression of a tobacco company can be compared to a painter's
work of art." Obviously the health nazis believe freedom of speech only applies
to viewpoints they agree with.</p>

<title>John Doe #2</title>
<!-- Place: Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 19, 1995; October 26, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>John Doe #2</h1>

<p>Immediately after the <a href="index.html">April 19, 1995 bombing</a> of
the Alfred R. Murrah Federal Building in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a>, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/">Oklahoma</a>, federal
investigators released sketches of two suspects, initially identified only
as John Doe #1 and John Doe #2.</p>

<p>Investigators later arrested Timothy McVeigh, claiming he was John Doe
#1.</p>

<p>However, no arrests have been made for John Doe #2, and investigators
have even denied his existence, despite mounting evidence that there was
another person involved. Authorities said that an innocent Army private
resembled the sketches, but never withdrew the sketches.</p>

<h2>Grand juror dismissed</h2>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/D/DavidDeming.html">David Deming</a>
reported that a juror was dismissed from the grand jury on October 26, 1995,
for questioning the prosecutors.</p>

<p>According to Deming, "This particular person had revealed that the jury
was essentially being manipulated by the prosecution, and they were not
allowed to follow leads to the mysterious John Doe #2, or call witnesses
to testify who had seen JD2 in the company of Mr. McVeigh."</p>

<p>Deming continued, "Oklahoma City television station KFOR (channel 4) has
now, at the last count, interviewed 12 (count 'em, twelve) eyewitnesses who
spotted JD2 either with McVeigh or close to his wherabouts. They also have
2 eyewitnesses who have appeared on camera who spotted a total of 4 people
(McVeigh, plus JD2, plus 2 others) in front of the Murrah building only
minutes before the blast."</p>

<h2>Videotape shows second person</h2>

<p>On October 27, 1995, the Associated Press reported that a surveillance
camera captured an image of a passenger -- "perhaps the long-sought John
Doe #2" -- in the Ryder truck that blew up the federal building.</p>

<p>The AP interviewed a law enforcement source who said that the camera
showed an unidentifiable and shadowy image of a person in the passenger
seat about three minutes before the federal building was bombed.</p>

<p>The AP quoted the source as saying that many investigors believe John
Doe #2 is still at large. "No one knows who he is, it's like he walked into
a wall and vanished," the source said.</p>

<h2>Witnesses Maintain Stories</h2>

<p>Over a dozen people say they saw John Doe #2. Witnesses vary in
details, but agree on certain characteristics: heavy set, dark complected,
tattoos. Witnesses in Junction City and Herington,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ks/">Kansas</a>, say that
they saw John Doe #2 with McVeigh when McVeigh stayed there right before
the bombing. Witnesses in Oklahoma City saw him with McVeigh the morning
of the bombing.</p>

<p>In Junction City, an employee of the Great Western Inn claimed J.D.
checked in three days before the bombing and drove a Ryder truck. Three
guests at the town's Dreamland Motel, where McVeigh stayed for four days,
claimed they saw him outside McVeigh's room. A delivery man claimed
the man was there when he brought Chinese take-out to McVeigh's room.</p>

<p>In Herington, a convenience store clerk remembers McVeigh and J.D.
buying cigarettes. A local who went for gas remembers the same
incident. The owner of a local diner remembers McVeigh, Nichols and J.D.
eating there the morning before the bombing, parking a Ryder truck
and a tan car with Arizona plates outside.</p>

<h2>Conspiracy Theories</h2>

<p>The government's silence about the John Doe #2 suspect has led
many people to offer theories as to the cause of such silence. The
most likely is that any uncertainty on their part will be used by
Timothy McVeigh's defense to help his case.</p>

<p>More extreme speculations are that JD2 was a government informant,
or an agent provacateur who provoked the bombing to justify a
crackdown on militias. While there is currently no evidence for these
ideas, such possibilities are not without precedent in the U.S.,
and the views' prevalence says volumes about the extent of citizens'
distrust of their government.</p>

<title>FCC Restricts Cable Companies</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: Act 1992; lawsuit February 22, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>FCC Restricts "Indecent" Leased-Access Cable</h1>

<p>Among the infringements of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and
Competition Act of 1992 was Section 10, which required cable companies to
restrict "indecency" on leased-access channels.</p>

<p>Indecency is ill-defined, but it is protected in print media by the
First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Section 10, however, allows the
FCC to shut down cable companies permanently if they air one program judged
indecent.</p>

<p>Congress mandated that cable companies provide leased-access channels in
1984, and had <em>forbidden</em> cable companies from exercising any control
over content, until the 1992 act, which <em>mandates</em> censorship.</p>

<p>The <a href="/revolution/by_name/A/ACLU.html">ACLU</a> along with several
other organizations filed suit in the U.S. Court of Appeals on February 22,
1993, challenging the new rules as unconstitutional.</p>

<h1>Drug Cops Kill Rancher</h1>

<p>On October 2, 1992, a swarm of law enforcement officers descended upon
the 200-acre
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Malibu.html">Malibu</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> ranch of
Donald P. Scott. Scott, 61, confronted the
deputies while armed with a handgun. He was shot and killed by
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/LosAngeles.html">Los
Angeles</a> Sheriff's Deputy Gary Spencer.</p>

<p>According to a report by Ron Sable and Carol Bidwel in the March 30, 1993
San Fernando <cite>Daily News</cite>, agencies involved in the raid included
the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, which led the raid, the Drug Enforcement
Administration, the National Park Service and the U.S. Border Patrol.</p>

<p>The Ventura County District Attorney's Office released a lengthy report
on the raid March 30, 1993. In it, District Attorney Michael Bradbury harshly
criticized the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, but decided not to
prosecute the deputy responsible for the killing. Bradbury forwarded the
report to Ventura and Los Angeles county grand juries for further
investigation.</p>

<p>The entrance to Scott's Trail's End Ranch lies in Los Angeles County, but
the ranch itself is entirely in Ventura County. The Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department did not notify Ventura authorities until after the
raid.</p>

<p>On September 23, 1992, a flyover by the DEA claimed that there were
"approximately 50 (marijuana) plants ... growing around some large trees"
near the ranch house. The flyover was used as the basis for the October 1
search warrant, even though U.S. Border Patrol agents conducting a secret
September 24 search of the property found no marijuana plants.</p>

<p>Nothing illegal was ever found at Scott's ranch.</p>

<title>Tobacco Advertising Deduction</title>

<h1>U.S. Senator Proposes Tobacco Ad Restriction</h1>

<p>In March 1993, U.S. Senator Tom Harkin (D-<a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ia/">Iowa</a>) proposed legislation
to eliminate the deduction of advertising as a business expense for
tobacco companies.</p>

<p>In true prohibitionist fashion, Harkin seeks to penalize the makers
of tobacco products for daring to hold a belief contrary to his own.</p>

<p>The <a href="/revolution/by_name/A/ACLU.html">ACLU</a> condemned the
proposal, citing Supreme Court decisions forbidding Congress from
discriminating in policy on the basis of speech content.</p>

<title>Warrantless Search At Fort Bend School</title>
<!-- Place: Missouri City, Fort Bend County, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Warrantless Search At Fort Bend School</h1>

<p>In April 1993, police made an unannounced, warrantless search of Elkins
High, a
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/MissouriCity.html">Missouri
City</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> high school
housing only ninth- and tenth-grade students.</p>

<p>As reported by William Peck in the April 29, 1993 <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Houston.html">Houston</a>
<cite>Post</cite>,
more than sixty officers "blocked classroom doors to control students coming
and going, and restricted students to one side of the room while drug-sniffing
dogs searched backpacks, lockers and parking lots."</p>

<p>All that was found was spilled beer in one vehicle and a trace of
marijuana in another. No arrests were made. Officials deemed the effort
a success and plan to repeat it at other schools.</p>

<p>This story points out many problems with government intervention. There's
no such thing as a free lunch, and when government offers "free" schools, you
can be sure there will be strings attached. The other problem highlighted here
is that pursuing the drug war to its fullest will require a police state.
Are you ready for such sweeps of your house?</p>

<title>The Ruby Ridge Trial</title>
<!-- Place: Ruby Ridge, Idaho (USA) -->
<!-- Time: July 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Trial of Randy Weaver</h1>

<p>In July 1993, a jury acquitted Randy Weaver of weapons and murder charges
resulting from his <a href="setup.html">set-up</a> and the subsequent
<a href="siege.html">siege</a> of his mountain cabin home by federal
agents. Weaver's friend, Kevin Harris, was also found innocent.</p>

<p>Harris, witnessing the agents' killing of Randy Weaver's dog and son during
the siege, fired at the agents in self-defense. Harris killed one of the
agents. At the trial, the prosecution claimed Harris fired first; the defense
produced evidence that the agent had fired seven shots before he was shot
himself.</p>

<p>The federal government argued that sniper FBI Lon Horiuchi accidentally
killed Weaver's wife Vicki. At the trial, however, Horiuchi testified that
he was an accurate shot at 200 yards.</p>

<p>Everything about the federal government's actions in this case is
sickening, but possibly the worst was their taunting of the Weaver family
after Vicki Weaver's murder: "Good morning, Mrs. Weaver. We had pancakes for
breakfast. What did you have?" That was one of the FBI's tactics revealed in
court records, reported by Jerry Seper in the Washington <cite>Times</cite>
in September 1993.</p>

<p>A jury found Weaver innocent of all serious charges, convicting him only on
the original weapons charge. The jury also found Harris innocent, ruling his
shooting of the marshal to be self-defense.</p>

<title>Siege of Ruby Ridge</title>
<!-- Place: Ruby Ridge, Idaho (USA) -->
<!-- Time: surveillance February 1991 - August 1992;
	attack August 21, 1992;
	surrender August 30 and 31, 1992 -->

<body>

<h1>FBI Siege of Ruby Ridge</h1>

<p>When federal agents <a href="setup.html">set up</a> Randy Weaver on
minor weapons violations, Weaver refused to show up in court for the charge,
instead holing up with his wife and four children in his mountain cabin
on <A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/id/RubyRidge.html">Ruby
Ridge</a>, forty miles south of the
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canadian</a> border.</p>

<p>A Justice Department attorney got an arrest warrant for Weaver, despite
knowing that a court official notified Weaver of an incorrect court date.
(Weaver wasn't going to show up anyway.)</p>

<p>For the charge of refusing to appear in court for a minor weapons
violation, the government conducted a military siege of Ruby Ridge worthy
of a small war. As reported by <a
href="/revolution/by_name/B/JamesBovard.html">James Bovard</a> in the
January 10, 1995 <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite>, after Weaver's February
1991 missed court appearance,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Federal agents then launched an elaborate 18-month surveillance of
Mr. Weaver's cabin and land.</p>

<p>David Niven, a defense lawyer involved in the subsequent court case, noted
later: "The U.S. marshals called in military aerial reconnaissance and had
photos studied by the Defense Mapping Agency. ... They had psychological
profiles performed and installed $130,000 worth of solar-powered long-range
spy cameras. They intercepted the Weavers' mail. They even knew the menstrual
cycle of Weaver's teenage daughter, and planned an arrest scenario around
it."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On August 21, 1992, the siege began in earnest. Six U.S. marshals,
armed and camouflaged, went onto Weaver's property to conduct undercover
surveillance. When Weaver's dogs started barking, they shot one of them.</p>

<p>Weaver's 25-year-old friend Kevin Harris and 14-year-old son Sammy and
saw the dog die. Sammy Weaver fired his gun towards the agents as his dad
yelled for him to come back to the cabin. "I'm coming, Dad," were Sammy
Weaver's last words before he was shot in the back and killed by
a U.S. marshal.</p>

<p>Kevin Harris, witnessing the agents' killing of the dog and child, fired
at the agents in self-defense, killing one of them.</p>

<p>After the initial shootout, the Weavers and Harris retreated into their
cabin, and a small army surrounded the area. Says Bovard: "the commander of
the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team was called in, and ordered federal agents to
shoot any armed adult outside the Weaver cabin, regardless of whether that
person was doing anything to threaten or menace federal agents. (Thanks to
the surveillance, federal officials knew that the Weavers always carried
guns when outside their cabin.)"</p>

<p>Against a handful of rural Idahoans with shotguns, the U.S. arrayed
<em>four hundred</em> federal agents with automatic weapons, sniper rifles
and night vision scopes.</p>

<p>On August 22, 1992, Randy Weaver went to see his son's body in the shack
where it lay. He was shot and wounded from behind by FBI sniper Lon Horiuchi.
As Weaver struggled back to his house, Horiuchi assassinated his wife Vicki
as she stood in the doorway, holding their 10-month-old baby.</p>

<p>Although the feds later claimed Vicki Weaver's killing was an accident,
the <cite>New York Times</cite> reported in 1993 that an internal FBI report
justified the killing by saying she put herself in danger. Horiuchi testified
in court that he was an accurate shot at 200 yards.</p>

<p>Everything about the federal government's actions in this case is
sickening, but possibly the worst was their taunting of the Weaver family
after Vicki Weaver's murder: "Good morning, Mrs. Weaver. We had pancakes for
breakfast. What did you have?" That was one of the FBI's tactics revealed in
court records, reported by Jerry Seper in the <cite>Washington Times</cite>
in September 1993.</p>

<p>After the initial shootout, the only shots fired were by federal agents.
Eleven days after the shootout Randy Weaver surrendered.</p>

<h1>The Ruby Ridge Set-up</h1>

<p>One of the FBI's favorite activities is spying on radical political
organizations. They don't care for being hindered by such things as the Bill
of Rights; the FBI has been censured by Congress several times for illegal
investigations.</p>

<p>In the late 1980's, the FBI and BATF wanted to infiltrate white
supremacist groups. In 1989, Kenneth Fadeley was a BATF informant posing as a
gun dealer to spy on groups such as the Aryan Nations in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/id/">Idaho</a>.</p>

<p>The BATF targeted white separatist Randy Weaver to be one of their moles.
Fadeley claims that Weaver approached him with the offer to sell sawed-off
shotguns in October 1989. Weaver claims he was entrapped, and in fact he
was acquitted of weapons charges when tried in court.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="/revolution/by_name/B/JamesBovard.html">James
Bovard</a> in the January 10, 1995 <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite>,
the BATF set up a sting in order to
blackmail Weaver into doing their bidding: "an undercover agent of the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms approached Mr. Weaver and pressured
the mountain man to sell him sawed-off shotguns. Mr. Weaver at first refused,
but the agent was persistent and Mr. Weaver eventually sold him two
shotguns -- thereby violating federal firearms law."</p>

<p>Weaver refused to cooperate with federal agents. To justify a
<a href="siege.html">militaristic retaliation</a>, BATF agents lied to the
U.S. attorney's office.
BATF agents claimed that Weaver had a criminal record and that he was a suspect
in several bank robberies. Both charges were fabrications, even according
to BATF Director John Magaw, who admitted the accusations were "inexcusable"
in testimony before Congress.</p>

<p>The U.S. attorney's office indicted Weaver on weapons charges in May
1990. Weaver was arraigned in January 1991. After missing his February 1991
court date, Weaver was indicted in March 1991
on charges of refusing to appear in court.</p>

<title>Julian Simon's Bet</title>
<!-- Place: Global -->
<!-- Time: bet October 1980; payoff October 1991 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Julian Simon's Winning Bet</h1>

<p> Economist Julian Simon wrote <cite>The Ultimate Resource</cite>
in the late 1970's in response to a wave of false environmental pessimism
arising from the now thoroughly discredited Club of Rome's <cite>Limits to
Growth</cite>. Simon presented evidence that natural resources are getting less
scarce, the world's food supply is improving, pollution in the richer countries
is decreasing and population growth is evidence of economic success.</p>

<p> In October 1980, Simon challenged famous environmental doomster Paul Ehrlich
and colleagues to a $1,000 bet that in ten years the price of any 
raw material they selected would fall (measured in constant 1980 dollars). </p>

<p> In October 1991, Ehrlich paid up. The prices of the five minerals chosen
(copper, chrome, nickel, tin and tungsten) had dropped substantially. Simon
wanted to renew his bet, upping the ante to $20,000, but the ecologists were
not interested.</p>

<h1>Three New Hampshire Libertarians Elected</h1>

<p>Three Libertarians were elected in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire's</a>
March 12, 1996 local elections. The victories show the
<a href="index.html">Libertarian Party of New Hampshire's</a> commitment
to building the party through grassroots efforts and gaining
candidate experience.</p>

<p>The winning Libertarians were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>John Lamb, Libertarian Party county coordinator for Rockingham County,
was the top vote-getter in the race for the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/Plaistow.html">Plaistow</a>,
New Hampshire Planning Board, winning a one-year term.</p>

<li><p><a href="/revolution/by_name/E/JeffEmery.html">Jeff Emery</a>,
Chair of the Libertarian Party of New Hampshire, was elected to a six-year
term to the nonpartisan office of Supervisor of the Checklist in 
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/Plaistow.html">Wentworth</a>,
New Hampshire.</p>

<p>"One of the reasons why we've been successful in New Hampshire is
... we are willing to start at the bottom, learn the process, and move up
the political ladder," said Emery of the three wins.</p>

<li><p>John Babiarz was elected Cemetery Trustee in 
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/Plaistow.html">Grafton</a>,

<title>Harry Browne for President</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Harry Browne for President</h1>

<p>The 1996 <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
national convention nominated author and investment adviser
<a href="/revolution/by_name/B/HarryBrowne.html">Harry Browne</a>
for President of the United States, and entrepreneur
<a href="/revolution/by_name/J/JoJorgensen.html">Jo Jorgensen</a>
for Vice President.</p>

<p>The campaign broke records for the party, setting several milestones
and heading the ticket for the party's <a href="index.html">1996 election
efforts</a>.</p>

<p>Final returns show the Browne/Jorgensen ticket
received 485,120 votes (0.5% of the total). This is the second-best
Libertarian showing ever, falling short only of our
<a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/election/1980/">1980</a> total.
Browne came in fifth, behind Bill Clinton, Bob Dole,
Ross Perot and Ralph Nader.</p>

<p>Browne did best in Arizona, Nevada and Alaska, getting about 1% of
the vote there.</p>

<hr>

<p>Browne <a href="announce.html">announced his candidacy</a> in 1994,
drawing on his following from his books and newsletters for support.
Browne was successfully able to get support from a broader base than
just current party members, with the party and the campaign raising
a record total $3 million in 1996.</p>

<p>Browne <a href="campaigned95.html">campaigned hard in '95</a> for
the party's nomination, visiting state conventions and giving occasional
speeches. Later that year, <cite>Why Government Doesn't Work</cite>
was published, generating significant interest in the campaign.
One of the year's interesting moments was <a href="cityvote.html">City
Vote</a>, a poll intended to focus the campaign on urban issues. Browne
was one of a couple of third-party candidates to qualify for the
ballot, and polled just under one percent.</p>

<p>Browne continued campaigning for the nomination in early 1996,
winning <a href="nhprimary.html">New Hampshire's Libertarian primary</a>
as well as other such contests. Browne handily won the party's nomination
at the national convention held July 4 - 7, 1996 in Washington, D.C.
Unsuccessful candidates for the nomination included
<a href="/revolution/by_name/O/DouglassOhmen.html">Douglass J.  Ohmen</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_name/S/IrwinSchiff.html">Irwin Schiff</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_name/T/RickTompkins.html">Rick Tompkins</a>.</p>

<p>Browne then continued a rigorous
full-time campaign, appearing on hundreds of radio talk shows. As
the election neared,
<a href="media.html">media coverage</a> intensified, with appearances on
CNN's Larry King Live, C-SPAN, the Lehrer News Hour, and other news
programs.</p>

<p>Libertarians organized on the Internet very effectively, distributing
campaign news via mailing lists and ganging together to dominate
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.coil.com/~ggorka/polls.html">every online poll</a> put on
the web. Net-savvy libertarians also organized
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://home.connectnet.com/qqq/speech/">Stop the Browne-Out</a>,
an independent effort to get Browne included in the debates. While
ultimately unsuccessful, the group did manage to get many journalists,
both online and print, to endorse Browne's inclusion in the debates.
Online political sites <a href="mentions.html">mentioned the party
frequently</a>.</p>

<p>The party achieved 50-state ballot status within a couple of
months of its convention, becoming the first third party ever to accomplish
that feat two presidential elections in a row. Only Clinton, Dole and
Perot were also on all ballots.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Post Mortem</h2>

<p>In December 1996, Browne offered to answer any questions about his
campaign to several online forums. Asking a libertarian for an opinion
is like asking an insurance salesman for a pitch, so he was nearly
inundated with suggestions and questions, most favorable.</p>

<p>Regarding his future plans, Browne said: "I do not know whether I'll
run again in 2000. I can't make that decision until 1999. It will depend
on whether the party is big enough to make a serious run, whether I have
commitments of sufficient funds to be able to begin the campaign with

<p>The Illinois State Rifle Association endorsed Libertarian Frank
Stratman for U.S. House 2nd Congressional District in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a>.</p>

behind the Republican winner but well ahead of the Democrat, and
was endorsed by the Lafayette newspaper.</p>

<li>Ypsilanti Township Trustee: Geoffrey Foster: 2,567 votes (24.1%)
</ul>

<p>The two winning candidates won by default. Brian Wisneski was one of
two candidates running for Clinton Township Trustee, in which the top
two get elected (however, he did beat a Republican write-in challenger).
Brett Cashman was one of four candidates running for Superior Township Park
Commissioner, in which the top six get elected.
Regardless of the electoral significance of these positions, having
officeholders of any type increases the party's respect and builds
experience for future higher office.</p>

<p>In the same election, voters approved a ballot initiative to legalize
limited casino gambling in Detroit.</p>

<p>Libertarians also ran in some nonpartisan races:</p>
<ul>
<li>Justice of the Supreme Court: Jerry J. Kaufman: 314,834 votes (6.1%)
<li>Justice of the Supreme Court: David Raaflaub: 85,714 (1.7%)
</ul>

<p>The vote totals for the Libertarian presidential ticket in Michigan
were about 50% more than required to retain ballot status, which the
state party now has through the 1998 elections.</p>

<title>1996 New Hampshire Elections</title>
<!-- Place: New Hampshire (USA) -->
<!-- Time: November 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>1996 Elections in New Hampshire</h1>

<p>The <a href="index.html">Libertarian Party of New Hampshire</a> ran
the following candidates for office in November 1996:</p>
<ul>
<li>US Senate: Ken Blevens: final count 21,366 votes (4.4%)
<li>US Representative District 1: Gary Flanders: with incomplete returns,
	7,811 votes (3%)
<li>Governor: Robert Kingsbury: final count 5,584 votes (1.1%)
<li>State Executive Council: Peter Gamble 
<li>State Representative District 14: James K. Wallack: 2,771 votes (16%)
<li>State Representative Rockingham District 8:
	<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/DonGorman.html">Don Gorman</a>
	(incumbent): 1,196 votes (23%)
</ul>

<p>Blevens's Senate bid held the balance of power in that election,
with the Republican getting 49% and the Democrat getting 46%. This
race was closely watched as being one the Democrats might pick up,
and early returns forecasted that they would get it.</p>

<p>The Libertarian Party lost ballot status in New Hampshire. Kingsbury
would have had to win 3% of the vote for the party to retain ballot status.
To get on the 1998 ballot, the party will have to collect 2,000 petition
signatures.</p>

<p>The Libertarian Party lost its only state representative in the nation
when a Democratic challenger unseated incumbent Don Gorman.</p>

<title>1996 West Virginia Elections</title>
<!-- Place: West Virginia (USA) -->
<!-- Time: November 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>1996 Elections in West Virginia</h1>

<p>The <a href="index.html">Libertarian Party of West Virginia</a> ran the
following candidates in the November 1996 elections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governor: Wallace Johnson: final count 15,958 votes (2.6%)
<li>State Senate District 9: Joseph Whelan: 3,994 votes (16.4%)
</ul>

<h2>Campaign Wins Major Party Status</h2>

<p>West Virginia, although of little electoral significance in the
presidential election, has some of the toughest ballot laws in the
country. The state always consumes tens of thousands of dollars
of L.P. presidential campaign resources to ensure 50-state ballot access,
as well as much of the resources of local and statewide candidates.</p>

<p>Libertarian gubernatorial candidate Dr. Wallace Johnson
ended that through the year 2000. He needed 1% of the vote to win the
Libertarian Party of West Virginia major party status in the
state, allowing the party to nominate candidates for any partisan office in
the state in the 1998 and 2000 elections without petitioning.
In late October, a poll by the Charleston <cite>Gazette</cite> found
2.4% support for Johnson, and he wound up with 2.5%.</p>

<p>Johnson's well-run campaign included a debate with the Democratic
and Republican candidates that was televised nationally on C-SPAN.</p>

<p>In 1992, the FBI conducted a military siege of a rural <a

ultimately killing Randy Weaver's dog, son and wife. The federal government's

<title>Libertarian Justice Elected</title>
<!-- Place: Washington (USA) -->

<body>

<h1>Former Libertarian elected to Washington Supreme Court</h1>

<p>Richard B. Sanders, a former Libertarian Party member, was elected
to the nonpartisan Supreme Court of the state of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a> on November
7, 1995. Washington requires Supreme Court candidates to be nonpartisan,
and Washington voters do not register to vote in any particular party.</p>

<p>Sanders initially joined the Libertarian Party in 1984, is well-known
as an advocate of property rights and civil liberties, and focused
his campaign on a libertarian theme that government is too instrusive in
both personal and economic matters.</p>

<p>Sanders defeated incumbent Roselle Pekelis for the three-year term.</p>

<title>Libertarian Elected</title>
<!-- Place: Avondale Estates, Georgia (USA) -->
<!-- Time: November 7, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Libertarian elected to city commission</h1>

<p>On November 7,1995, Libertarian Party of Georgia member Bruce Van Buren
won election to the Avondale Estates City Commission, placing first in a
field of five candidates vying for two open seats in a nonpartisan race.</p>

<p>Avondale Estates is a "planned community." It has the second highest
median income of any <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a> city.</p>

<p>According to campaign manager <a
href="/revolution/by_name/C/RonCrickenberger.html">Ron Crickenberger</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... much was made of Bruces party affiliation by the other candidates,
including 11th hour hit pieces describing all the LP positions people
usually talk about when one of our candidates has them running scared.</p>

<p>... The campaign spent about $2,200.00 to win 428 votes. Turnout was high
at over 55%. We put five pieces of literature into every household.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A pre-walk card that we mailed out in batches just large enough to be
covered by each weeks walk. The card simply had Bruce's picture with a short
note saying "I'm coming by to talk to you about city issues."  It serves as a
great time saver for the candidate, and commits him to a certain number of
doors per week.</p></li>

<li><p>A standard candidate issue card. Bruce knocked on every door in the
1,177 home city to hand deliver this card and chat with everyone who was
home.</p></li>

<li><p>An issue letter. The one issue in the campaign, other than Bruces party
affiliation, was restoring the main Tudor Village Building. One candidate had
proposed for the city to buy the building. We polled the electorate with the
question "would you be more likely to vote for a candidate who wanted the city
to buy the Tudor Village with tax increases, or one who wanted the city to
more aggressively pursue private investors?"  Our guys position was a ten-to-one
favorite, so the letter quite naturally stressed this heavily.</p></li>

<li><p>A "good guy" postcard designed to hit the Saturday before the election.
We also reinforced the message about our position on the Tudor Village.</p></li>

<li><p>A last minute endorsement letter signed by 35 members of the community.
We put this out when we found out about the hit pieces charging Bruce with
wanting vending machines filled with drugs, guns and prostitutes in the
elementary school. We found out about the hit pieces on Sunday afternoon, got
signatures of prominent people for a couple of hours, put the piece together
till 1:00AM, got it printed at Kinkos and distributed to every home in the
city by 5:00PM Monday.</p></li>
</ol>

<P>We also made at least two dialings to  every household in the city, and
identified over two hundred Van Buren supporters for a Monday night GOTV
effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<title>Libertarian Elected</title>
<!-- Place: Auburn, Georgia (USA) -->

<body>

<h1>Libertarian elected to city commission</h1>

On November 7, 1995, Libertarian Party of Georgia member Dewayne Methaney won
a seat on the
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/Auburn.html">Auburn</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a>,
City Commission, placing second in a field
of six candidates vying for two spots. Methaney's campaign in the nonpartisan
race was managed by Libertarian Party campaigner Larry Bolin.</p>

<p>LP State Chair Montague Boyd reported that, "In a last ditch effort, the
Democratic machine sent out an unsigned letter comparing Libertarians to
Howard Stern. This smear campaign failed because Dewayne had a positive
message that resonated with the voters of Auburn."</p>

<title>Jimmy Blake Campaign</title>
<!-- Place: Birmingham, Alabama (USA) -->
<!-- Time: November 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Libertarian Joins Birmingham City Council</h1>

<p>Dr. Jimmy Blake, chair of the Libertarian Party of Alabama, ran a successful
campaign for <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/al/Birmingham.html">Birmingham</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/al/">Alabama</a>, City Council
District 3. Although the race was
nonpartisan, Blake's Libertarian affiliation was brought up both by himself and
by his opponent.</p>

<p>The larger of Birmingham's two newspapers, the <cite>News</cite>
(circulation 170,000), endorsed Blake, while the smaller, the
<cite>Post-Herald</cite>, endorsed his opponent. The <cite>News</cite> praised
Blake for his energy and cautioned him to focus on local issues, a reference to
Libertarian national platform issues brought up by Blake's opponent.</p>

<p>The final (run-off) election votes were Jimmy Blake, 2906 (55.5%), and
Virginia Volker, 2332.</p>

<hr>

<p>Postscript: In 1996, Blake decided to run for U.S. Senate as a
Republican. We will see how receptive the old party is to new ideas.</p>

"Live Free or Die," is arguably the most successful Libertarian state
affiliate. The party has racked up an impressive number of wins

and successful legislation.</p>

<title>LPIL Phone System</title>

<h1>Phone System Helps Party</h1>

<p>Posted March 20, 1996 to LPUS by James D. Solomon
(<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:solomon@comm.mot.com">solomon@comm.mot.com</a>),
Corresponding Secretary of the
<a href="index.html">Libertarian Party of Illinois</a>:</p>

<p>The Illinois LP installed a new voice-mail system about a month ago
and in my opinion it has been a resounding success.  Many thanks to
Washington State activist,
<A href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a>,
for his <a href="/revolution/politics/strategy/tips/">"tips"</a>,
<a href="/revolution/politics/strategy/tips/phone.html">one of
which</a> provided the idea behind our voice mail system.</p>

<p>By replacing our "rollover line" with Amertech's "Enhanced Voice Mail
for Small Business", we actually are saving money on our phone bills.
In addition, our response time to inquiries has gone from days/weeks
down to minutes/hours, because messages can be retrieved from any
phone at any time, regardless of location.  Our outgoing message also
lists our state chair's pager number for "urgent" messages.  It's
amazing how much more likely you are to get press coverage when you
return reporters' phone calls in short order!</p>

<p>If you would like to see how we've organized our mailbox,
call (847) 776-8090 and select one or more of the options.
Please feel free to Email me for further information.</p>

<title>Harry Browne for President</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Harry Browne for President</h1>

<p>The 1996 <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
national convention nominated author and investment adviser
<a href="/revolution/by_name/B/HarryBrowne.html">Harry Browne</a>
for President of the United States, and entrepreneur
<a href="/revolution/by_name/J/JoJorgensen.html">Jo Jorgensen</a>
for Vice President.</p>

<p>The campaign broke records for the party, setting several milestones
and heading the ticket for the party's <a href="index.html">1996 election
efforts</a>.</p>

<p>Final returns show the Browne/Jorgensen ticket
received 485,120 votes (0.5% of the total). This is the second-best
Libertarian showing ever, falling short only of our
<a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/election/1980/">1980</a> total.
Browne came in fifth, behind Bill Clinton, Bob Dole,
Ross Perot and Ralph Nader.</p>

<p>Browne did best in Arizona, Nevada and Alaska, getting about 1% of
the vote there.</p>

<hr>

<p>Browne <a href="announce.html">announced his candidacy</a> in 1994,
drawing on his following from his books and newsletters for support.
Browne was successfully able to get support from a broader base than
just current party members, with the party and the campaign raising
a record total $3 million in 1996.</p>

<p>Browne <a href="campaigned95.html">campaigned hard in '95</a> for
the party's nomination, visiting state conventions and giving occasional
speeches. Later that year, <cite>Why Government Doesn't Work</cite>
was published, generating significant interest in the campaign.
One of the year's interesting moments was <a href="cityvote.html">City
Vote</a>, a poll intended to focus the campaign on urban issues. Browne
was one of a couple of third-party candidates to qualify for the
ballot, and polled just under one percent.</p>

<p>Browne continued campaigning for the nomination in early 1996,
winning <a href="nhprimary.html">New Hampshire's Libertarian primary</a>
as well as other such contests. Browne handily won the party's nomination
at the national convention held July 4 - 7, 1996 in Washington, D.C.
Unsuccessful candidates for the nomination included
<a href="/revolution/by_name/O/DouglassOhmen.html">Douglass J.  Ohmen</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_name/S/IrwinSchiff.html">Irwin Schiff</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_name/T/RickTompkins.html">Rick Tompkins</a>.</p>

<p>Browne then continued a rigorous
full-time campaign, appearing on hundreds of radio talk shows. As
the election neared,
<a href="media.html">media coverage</a> intensified, with appearances on
CNN's Larry King Live, C-SPAN, the Lehrer News Hour, and other news
programs.</p>

<p>Libertarians organized on the Internet very effectively, distributing
campaign news via mailing lists and ganging together to dominate
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.coil.com/~ggorka/polls.html">every online poll</a> put on
the web. Net-savvy libertarians also organized
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://home.connectnet.com/qqq/speech/">Stop the Browne-Out</a>,
an independent effort to get Browne included in the debates. While
ultimately unsuccessful, the group did manage to get many journalists,
both online and print, to endorse Browne's inclusion in the debates.
Online political sites <a href="mentions.html">mentioned the party
frequently</a>.</p>

<p>The party achieved 50-state ballot status within a couple of
months of its convention, becoming the first third party ever to accomplish
that feat two presidential elections in a row. Only Clinton, Dole and
Perot were also on all ballots.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Post Mortem</h2>

<p>In December 1996, Browne offered to answer any questions about his
campaign to several online forums. Asking a libertarian for an opinion
is like asking an insurance salesman for a pitch, so he was nearly
inundated with suggestions and questions, most favorable.</p>

<p>Regarding his future plans, Browne said: "I do not know whether I'll
run again in 2000. I can't make that decision until 1999. It will depend
on whether the party is big enough to make a serious run, whether I have
commitments of sufficient funds to be able to begin the campaign with
$1 million in hand and know that it's likely we'll have $30 million or
more for the campaign itself, and whether I still feel young enough to
undertake the task."</p>

<p>In the meantime, he has set up an exploratory committee to start
raising money, has begun a syndicated radio commentary, and is trying
to become part of a lecture bureau to speak on politics at events across
the country.</p>

<title>Harry Browne for President</title>
<!-- Place: ??? (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Investment Author Announces Libertarian Bid</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/B/HarryBrowne.html">Harry Browne</a>,
best-selling author of nine books over the last two decades
and well-known investment adviser, announced in 1994 his intention to
campaign for the 1996 Libertarian Party presidential nomination.</p>

<p>In telephone conversations with national party officials, Browne outlined
his goal to "make the Libertarian Party a permanent, substantial force in
American politics." His intentions was to recruit new members for the
party and one campaign goal was to double the membership of the party by
1996.</p>

<p>One of Browne's advantages, he said, was that he could garner significant
support, including campaign financing, from outside the present membership
of the Libertarian Party. In fact, the Party and the Browne campaign
together raised over $3 million in 1996, a record for the party.</p>

<p>Winning the election is a long-shot, he admitted, but he does not concede
that it outside the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>Browne, a
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> resident,
has not run for public office before and in fact previously advocated
staying out of politics.  He has not previously been a member of the
Libertarian Party or any other political party. However, his writings have
been influential in the Libertarian movement.</p>

<p>His books include <cite>You Can Profit from the Coming Monetary
Crisis</cite> and <cite>How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World</cite>.
Following libertarian tradition, Browne wrote a campaign book,
titling his <cite>Why Government Doesn't Work</cite>. The book was the
first libertarian campaign book to be distributed to the mass market.</p>

<p>Brown pledged to begin campaigning full-time in January 1995.
Campaign supporters include investment newsletter publishers and authors
Mark Skousen and Douglas Casey, and 1984 Libertarian Presidential candidate
<a href="/revolution/by_name/B/DavidBergland.html">David Bergland</a>.</p>

<title>CityVote Results</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: November 7, 1995 -->
</head>

<h1>CityVote</h1>

<p><img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.cityvote.org/cityvote/home.htm">CityVote</a> was
a presidential preference primary held November 7, 1995
in seventeen cities across the United States. As a preference primary, CityVote
was nonbinding, that is, more a poll than anything else. However, as
actual 1995 voters were likely 1996 voters, it was an interesting poll.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most spectacular thing about CityVote was its abject
failure. Intended to focus the 1996 presidential campaigns on "urban
issues" such as poverty and crime, CityVote was almost completely
ignored by the major presidential candidates. Several of the cities that
participated were fairly small towns, including Fayette,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mo/">Missouri</a> and
Greenburgh,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/">New York</a>.
None of the major metropolises participated --
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York
City</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/LosAngeles.html">Los
Angeles</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>,
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/SanFrancisco.html">San
Francisco</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Houston.html">Houston</a>
etc. were all absent.</p>

<p>From a Libertarian point of view, the most significant aspect of
CityVote was that Libertarian Harry Browne qualified for it. CityVote
candidates were required to meet stringent criteria before being allowed
on the ballot and into the debates.</p>

<p>Browne won 0.94% of the total vote, placing eleventh in a field of
21. Browne did noticeably better in cities where he campaigned personally,
getting 5.1% in Fayette,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mo/">Missouri</a>;
2.2% in Boulder,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/co/">Colorado</a>; and 1.6% in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/Tucson.html">Tucson</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a>.</p>

<p>In almost every city, the top three vote-getters were Bill Clinton,
Colin Powell and Bob Dole in that order, with Clinton usually having a
sizable lead over his next competitor. Burlington,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/vt/">Vermont</a>, the city
that elected a Socialist mayor and then sent him to Congress, gave
Jesse Jackson the third highest rank. Fayette, Missouri, for some reason,
gave transcendental meditator John Hagelin of the Natural Law Party
the third spot. Tucson, Arizona gave capitalist tool Steve Forbes third
ranking.</p>

<title>1996 New Hampshire Primary</title>
<!-- Place: New Hampshire (USA) -->
<!-- Time: February 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>1996 New Hampshire Presidential Primaries</h1>

<p>In February 1996,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire</a> held
its first-in-the-nation presidential primaries. The
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a> held its
second ever New Hampshire presidential primary, and the first one to be
contested, although the primary was a preference primary with no bearing
on delegate selection. Of 304,904 ballots cast in the primaries,
1,642 (0.5%) were cast in the Libertarian primary, a voter turnout of about
47% of registered Libertarians. The final results were:</p>

<table border>
<tr><th>Candidate</th>		<th>#Votes</th>	<th>%Votes</th></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/revolution/by_name/B/HarryBrowne.html">Harry Browne</a></td>
	<td>661</td>	<td>40.3%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Other</td>		<td>359</td>	<td>21.8%</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/revolution/by_name/S/IrwinSchiff.html">Irwin Schiff</a></td>
	<td>343</td>	<td>20.9%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pat Buchanan</td>	<td>176</td>	<td>10.7%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Steve Forbes</td>	<td>103</td>	<td>6.3%</td></tr>
<tr><th>Total</th>		<th>1,642</th>	<th>100%</th></tr>
</table>

<p>Browne and Schiff were the only candidates to register for the
Libertarian primary. Buchanan, Forbes and "Other" were write-ins.
Write-ins are counted separately only if running in another party's
primary.</p>

<p>In other parties' primaries, populist Pat Buchanan won the Republican
Party primary, and incumbent Bill Clinton overwhelmingly won the Democratic
Party primary.</p>

</head>

<body>

<h1>Media Coverage of the Browne Campaign</h1>

<p>The Browne campaign received a variety of media coverage. Talk radio
tended to be most favorable, with many talk show hosts endorsing Browne.
Newspaper articles and television mentions were usually fair, but many
adopted a condescending tone.</p>

<p>All in all, Browne appeared on over 500 talk radio shows in 1996.</p>

<p>What follows is a very incomplete list of media coverage of the
Browne campaign.</p>

in office if elected: "I would submit my budget immediately and put enormous
pressure on Congress to pass it. If they come back with an alternative that
is over $500 billion or increases taxes, I'll veto it. And if they come up
with one that's even smaller, I'll sign it even if the whole damn thing
goes to save the spotted owl."</p>

<title>Libertarian Activism: Strategy and Tactics</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: contemporary -->
</head>
<body>

<h1>Libertarian Activism: Strategy and Tactics</h1>

<p>Sometime around 1991, Libertarian activist
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a> began
a series of tips, tactics, strategies, and case studies that became
known as "Tom's Tips" and proved invaluable to activists across
the country trying to learn how to grow their parties and run
campaigns. This web page has grown from that effort and now includes
articles from many people.</p>

<p>The premier resource for Libertarian activists is the outstanding
newsletter <cite>Libertarian Volunteer</cite>, edited by LP Communications
Director <a href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWinter.html">Bill Winter</a>.
It is simply the best newsletter in the libertarian movement. It is
written for LP volunteers, activists, officers, and candidates. If you are
one of those, send your request to Bill Winter to get on that mailing
list.</p>

<title>Phone Service</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Phone service for LP groups</h2>
<p>Last updated 4/2/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<h3>Your Phone Line Is Your Life Line</h3>

<p>The most basic function of each state LP is to have a phone line to 
handle inquiries. Ideally, this should consist of both a local and 
toll-free number that goes to a voice mail box, not a physical phone or 
someone's answering machine. The reason is that a voice mail box is 
always on duty, always cheerful, never screws up, and the phone number 
won't ever need to be changed (i.e., because your phone staffer moves 
or is not doing a very good job.) In Washington state, we disconnected our 
physical phoneline and had the existing number redirected to a voice 
mail box. Things are much more efficient now!</p>

<h3>Voice Mail Boxes</h3>

<p>Instead of having a residential phone/answering machine, get a "market 
expansion line" and a voice mail box from your local phone company. 
(You can keep your existing number.) Your phone company's voice mail 
service won't cost much more than cheaper companies, and they're not 
likely to go out of business. Remember, your phone number will be on a 
lot of literature, so you don't want to have to change it! In 
Washington state, our "phone bill" is about $30 a month with a one-time 
setup fee of $40. Make sure that only one person (ideally, the 
membership chair, or whoever handles prospect mailings) knows the 
password to the voice mail box. Make sure that only one person (your 
Treasurer?) is authorized to make any changes/cancellations to this 
service and arrange with the voice mail company to demand a password 
before implementing any changes. Have an attractive female voice record 
your friendly voice mail message. "Thank you for calling the 
Libertarian Party of Washington! We're sorry, but all our lines are 
busy. [Technically, that's true. ;-)] To receive a free information 
packet, please leave your name, address, and phone number. Thank you 
for calling!"</p>

<h3>Toll-Free Numbers</h3>

<p>Also, get a toll-free number for prospects outside your local calling 
area. In
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a>,
we use Sprint (1-800-877-4020) for our toll-free 
number, and it doesn't cost much more than cheaper services (plus 
they'll be in business for a while.) Our toll-free bill is about $25 a 
month, and there is no setup fee. You can pick your toll-free number, 
so make it something easier to remember (if you were to hear it on a 
radio ad, for example.) There are still some 1-800-nnn-1776 numbers 
left! And make sure that your 1-800 number also goes to your voice mail 
box. Again, make sure that only one person (your Treasurer?) is 
authorized to make any changes/cancellations to your toll-free service 
and arrange with the phone company to demand a password before 
implementing any changes.</p>

<h3>Phone Listings</h3>

<p>Call <em>all</em> the local phone companies that service your state to get 
your 1-800 number listed in all the major phone books in the state 
(outside of the local calling area, of course.) Put the number in the 
White Pages, don't bother with the Yellow Pages (it costs extra and 
most people wouldn't know what heading to look under.) List the local 
number in your local area directories only. Due to the monopoly nature 
of local phone service, phone books do not overlap coverage areas. It 
costs about $1 a month for each phone book listing (included on your  
phone bill.) Also, make sure that your toll-free numbers are listed 
statewide with directory assistance, the Secretary of State, the League 
of Women Voters, etc. Anticipate the different ways people will try to 
find your number!</p>

<h1>Turmoil in the Arizona LP</h1>

<p>In early 1995, the Libertarian Party of Arizona was plunged into turmoil
when members of a county affiliate formed their own state party and attempted
to be recognized as such.</p>

<p>Members of the Pima County affiliate of the Libertarian Party of Arizona
took advantage of obscure provisions of the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a> election code.
The code
states that only elected precinct committeemen can run or vote for party
office. This rule is routinely ignored by all parties in Arizona, partly
because similar laws regulating internal party structure have been found
unconstitutional.</p>

<p>The breakaway group elected 13 precinct committeemen, and five of those
drove to
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/Phoenix.html">Phoenix</a>
to hold a "convention" according to state law. Those five
presumed to form a state party, elected officers and adopted bylaws, calling
themselves the Arizona affiliate of the Libertarian Party. Their bylaws gave
the state chair authority to appoint acting county chairs, thus giving their
small group complete control over party leadership.</p>

<p>The "new" Arizona Libertarian Party then told the Arizona Secretary of State
and the bank which held the state party's bank account that they were the
official party. The "existing" Arizona Libertarian Party appealed to the
Libertarian Party National Committee for a decision and reasserted control over
its bank account. The National Committee sided with the existing affiliate and
sent a letter to the "new" party to cease and desist using the Libertarian
Party name.</p>

<p>The letter signed by National Committee Chair <a
href="/revolution/by_name/D/SteveDasbach.html">Steve Dasbach</a> reads in
part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The political entity recognized by the Libertarian National Committee as our
affiliate party in Arizona is the "Arizona Libertarian Party", currently
chaired by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/T/RickTompkins.html">Rick Tompkins</a>.</p>

<p>Also according to our Bylaws, "No person, group or organization may use the
name 'Libertarian Party' or any confusingly similar designation except an
organization to which the [National Libertarian] Party grants affiliate party
status." [Article 8, Section 1.] The Libertarian National Committee remains
fully committed to enforcing this provision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the "new party" officers, Secretary Arthur Kerschen posted a "May
1995 status report" to LiberNet, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On January 28, 1995 new officers were elected to leadership positions in the
Arizona Libertarian party pursuant to Libertarian bylaws and Arizona law.
Elected were Dan Detaranto as Chairman, Arthur Kerschen as Secretary and Robert
Bushkin as Treasurer. The controversy arose when former Chairman Rick Tompkins
and other former state officers refused to acknowledge their removal from
office.</p>

<p>... Tompkins called a "convention" for April 29 and 30 in Phoenix in
conjunction with the Natcom meeting scheduled that same weekend ... The state
officers and John Zajac, a Pima County Libertarian activist, went to Phoenix on
March 21 to discuss the situation with Tompkins ...</p>

<p>... 321 Libertarians in Pima, Maricopa, Cochise and Yavapai Counties
contributed money to the Arizona Libertarian Party (to become Members of Record
under the bylaws) and authorized in writing before two witnesses that John
Zajac was instructed to vote on their behalf at this "convention". Proxy voting
is authorized by the bylaws only for Members of Record.</p>

<p>... the proxies were refused ... Police were called in to forcibly remove
Zajac and other Libertarians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In actuality, the breakaway Libertarians attended the Libertarian convention
apparently to cause such a disturbance. The 321 proxies, each of whom donated
$1 to become a member of record, were refused because the deadline had passed
for becoming a proxy in time for voting at the convention. The breakaways
disrupted the convention with frequent objections and outbursts until they were
ejected.</p>

<p>The May 1995 <cite>Libertarian Party News</cite>, in <img
src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.lp.org/lp/lpn/9505-Tompkins.html">"New Entry for '96?"</a>
reported Rick Tompkins' April 10 announcement to form an exploratory committee
to seek the Libertarian nomination for President. The article introduced
Tompkins as "long-time Libertarian activist and Arizona state party
chairman."</p>

<title>Ballot Access in Arizona</title>
<!-- Place: Arizona (USA) -->
<!-- Time: law revamped late 1970's;
	lawsuit filed July 3, 1991; -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Ballot Access in Arizona</h1>

<p><A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a> toughened
its ballot access laws after Steve Davis, a Republican
Congressman, switched to the Libertarian Party in the mid-1970's, ran for
Congress as an independent, and came in a close second in a three-way race.</p>

<p>The state totally rewrote its election code, adopting a completely new Title
16 in the late 1970's.</p>

<p>Among the new code's provisions were minutely detailed specifications of a
political party's internal structure, such as who could vote for party
officers, when, where and how meetings were to be held, and so forth.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/H/ErnestHancock.html">Ernest Hancock</a>
mounted a legal challenge to the new code in 1991. He ran for
office as an independent in 1990 in order to gain standing to file the lawsuit,
and filed the federal lawsuit <cite>Hancock v. Symington, et al.</cite> on July
3, 1991.</p>

<p>Hancock's challenge was based on Supreme Court case law, the State
Constitution, and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution
supporting the claim that the State has no authority determining the internal
structure of a political party. Legal cases involved include <cite>Norman v.
Reed</cite>, <cite>Tashijan v. Republican Party of Connecticut</cite> and
<cite>Eu v. Democratic Party of San Francisco</cite>.</p>

<p>The lawsuit succeeded in changing Arizona law, particularly gaining a
statement by the Arizona Attorney General that the State cannot determine
internal party structure.</p>

<h1>Colorado Improves Ballot Access</h1>

<p>May 25, 1995 posting to Libernet, from
<a href="/revolution/by_name/A/DavidAitken.html">David Aitken</a>:</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/co/">Colorado</a> Governor
Roy Romer signed HB95-1022, sponsored by
State Representative Ron Tupa and Senator Paul Weissman, today.
This bill, a response to a lawsuit by Libertarian candidate
Judd Ptak, makes it somewhat easier for third party and
independent candidates to get on the ballot.</p>

<p>The changes include a filing fee of $500 for presidential candidates, lower
signatures for non-statewide offices except Congress, a longer petitioning
period, a cure period, and requirements for the Secretary of State to issue
statements of sufficiency or insufficiency in a timely manner.</p>

<p>The Colorado Coalition for Fair and Open Elections, which included
Libertarian, Green, Taxpayer, and Natural Law parties and the Labor Party
Advocates, did most of the lobbying for the bill.  The coalition will be
attempting to draft a party petitioning bill for the next session of the
legislature.</p>

<title>Eggert Campaign</title>
<!-- Place: Bethlehem, Connecticut (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>George Eggert Campaign</h1>

<p>Mark A. Tuniewicz, Director of Communications of the <a
href="index.html">Libertarian Party of Connecticut</a>,
posted the following message to LPUS on May 3, 1995:<p>

<p>LPCT is pleased to announce the latest in its slate of candidates for the
Fall elections.  Mr. George Eggert, who with his wife MaryAnn recently changed
their party registration to Libertarian, is a former 2-term first selectman in
the town of Bethlehem, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ct/">Connecticut</a>,
and served 10 years previously as selectman.  A
self-employed 30-year resident, Mr. Eggert will run in a 3 or 4-way race for
his old seat, and will likely be the first elected Connecticut Libertarian.</p>

<p>... Mr. Eggert was obtained as a prospect through the LPCT's quarterly
series of public forums.  The Forums, featuring nationally-know speakers on
topics of general interest, have been useful as both publicity vehicles and to
obtain prospects.  The last two Forums featured a nationally-known inner-city
police chief who came out in favor of drug decriminalization, and the president
of  Education Alternatives, Inc., a MN-based firm to which the management of
the entire Hartford, CT school system was contracted out.</p>

<title>TV Ads</title>

<h1>Television Ads</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a>:</p>

<p>The Washington LP is thinking about doing some TV ads, probably for 
broadcast during Rush Limbaugh's TV show or during "Star Trek:TNG" 
re-runs. I've got an idea that I'd like to bounce off you folks for a 
sanity check. The basic idea is that there will be one 60-second ad 
consisting of two 30-second spots shown back-to-back. Taken together, 
the ad will attract people who respect gun rights and will consider 
drug legalization (i.e., potential libertarians.)</p>

<p>Ideally, we would create customized versions of this ad so other state 
LPs could show their own 1-800 numbers. Interested state LPs would 
share the production costs and then raise money to broadcast it in their
areas.</p>

<pre>
"GUN CONTROL"
Video 1: White text on black
Audio 1: "All those in favor of gun control, raise your hands."
Video 2: Footage of Nazi rally with stiff-armed salute.
Audio 2: "Heil!"
Video 3: White text on black
Audio 3: "All those opposed?"
Video 4: Famous photo of little Jewish boy surrendering (with arms up) 
to SS soldier.
Audio 4: marching sounds
Video 5: White text on black: "Libertarian Party 1-800..."
Audio 5:  "The Libertarian Party says we must learn from history. We 
will never compromise your right to keep and bear arms. For a free 
information kit call 1-800..."

"DRUG PROHIBITION"
 Video 1: Photo of gangsters with tommy-guns
Audio 1: (sad ragtime music) "In the 1920s, alcohol prohibition gave us 
criminal gangs and turf wars, but it didn't stop alcohol use."

Video 2: Photo of repeal poster
Audio 2: (stop music) "We soon re-legalized alcohol to protect our 
children and our neighborhoods from these gangsters."

Video 3: Photo of gangs giving hand signals
Audio 3: (rap music) "Nowadays, drug prohibition has again given us 
criminal gangs and turf wars, but again, it isn't stopping drug use."

Video 5: White text on black: Libertarian Party 1-800...
"The Libertarian Party says we must learn from history. For a free 
information kit call 1-800..."

<title>Debating</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Debating</h2>
<p>Last updated 9/14/95 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here are some tips from a professional  political debater:</p>

<p>It's crucial to remember that "people want to know how much you care, 
before they care how much you know."  You need to establish common 
ground (show that you both value the same ends) before you can explain 
why you think your means are just and work best.</p>

<p>Over the last 10 years of campaigning, giving interviews, and being a 
talk radio host, I've developed a 4-part formula for responding to most 
questions, criticisms, and concerns in a way that builds bridges (as 
opposed to burning them.)</p>

<ol>
<li>State your credentials.</li>
<li>Share his goals.</li>
<li>Show how government has screwed things up and who benefits from 
these unjust policies.</li>
<li>Show the libertarian solution.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's an example.</p>

<p><b>HIM:</b>  You libertarians don't care about the poor.</p>

<p><b>YOU:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>As the grandson of poor immigrants,
<li>I care about poor folks and want to see them prosper the way our 
family did.
<li>The problem is that many government policies trap people in 
poverty.  For example, why should it be illegal for a single mother to 
start her own hair-braiding business in her apartment?  Why should 
government keep the poor down just so established businesses won't have 
to face her competition?
<li>So a good first step would be to legalize self-employment.  Our 
immigrant grandparents were able to pull themselves out of poverty in 
an age of very few regulations on start-up businesses.  Of course, 
there's a lot of other changes we need to make too.
</ol>

<p>Here are some tips specifically for debating online...

<p>Don't use all-caps.  It makes you look rabid and kooky.  It makes it 
look like you don't have confidence in the power of your ideas and you 
have to make up for it with SCREAMING. Ever seen ultra-right-wing 
propaganda? It's full of random all-caps.</p>

<p>Don't use extreme punctuation, either.  As with all-caps, it makes you 
look like you've lost self-control !!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you use standard 
punctuation, good grammar & spelling, and are polite and restrained, 
you are much more likely to win respect (and perhaps reconsideration) 
from your "opponent" and you will impress other readers.  Especially on 
the gun issue, where opponents already assume that you're a rabid nut.</p>

<p>Make sure your grammar is perfect.  You should make it a point to check 
all your email before you send it.  Nothing screams "I'm uneducated and 
don't care" more than mis-spellings and sloppy grammar.</p>

<p>Consider saving "boilerplate" arguments you've made on email so that 
you can recycle them easily without having to re-type.  For example, I 
have an email folder called "debate ammo" where I keep messages 
arranged by topic, e.g., "gun control." And in that message, I store 
sound-bite answers from past messages (mine and others') that I want to 
recycle. For example:</p>

<p>Q. Guns are dangerous and should be outlawed.</p>
<p>A. This is a dangerous line of thinking. If we start outlawing 
"dangerous" objects, where will it end? We have already heard calls for 
violent video games to be restricted and for pornography and certain 
ads to be outlawed. So-called liberals are often leading the charge. 
I'm not a fan of these products, but the erosion of your rights means 
the erosion of my rights. I can well imagine that things I hold near 
and dear will be next.</p>

<p>That way, whenever someone uses that argument with me (and you know it 
comes up a lot) you already have a snappy answer that is exactly what 
you want.  Then you can cut and paste it in, edit as needed, and it 
saves lots of time.</p>

<title>Calls To Action</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Calls to action</h2>
<p>Last updated 7/25/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here are some ideas that might get more people (like me) to act on your 
email "calls to action."</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make your subject line give an indication of the urgency. Indicate 
the deadline up front. Otherwise, people like me will either assume 
that it's too late or that they can put it off.</p></li>

<li><p>The very first sentences of your post should tell lamebrains like 
me <em>exactly</em> what you want us to do. Most people only read the first 
few sentences of any post, so you better put your important stuff 
there. Keep it short and simple.  Put the background info at the bottom 
of the post.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Consider using this formula in your "call to action" posts:</p>

<pre>
From: Patricia Freeman
Subject: DUE 7/26: call Congress re: gun law                 <---- 
indicates deadline, topic, and action required

Call or fax your U.S. Congressman's office before 2pm EST on Tuesday 
7/26.   Ask your Congressman to vote against the semi-auto and 
10-round-magazine bans in the House Crime Bill.  Also ask him to send 
you a letter explaining his vote and how he is working to defend our 
right of self-defense. (That way your opinion will be registered in 
their form-letter database.)

If you don't know the name or phone number of your Congressman, call 
202-224-3121 (the Congressional switchboard) and they'll be able to put 
you through. Or, you can call his local office (check the phone book or 
call directory assistance.) By the way, you can get a directory of all 
your national, state, and local politicians for free from your local 
League of Women Voters.  Everyone should get a copy of this free booklet!

Anyway, here's the background info:  This vote will be taken on the 
House Floor at 3:00pm EST on Tuesday 7/26.  At issue is...

<h2>FAQs and Related Resources</h2>
<p>Last updated 11/27/96 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here are some FAQs and other resources to help you answer questions and
assist with your research.  If you have a libertarian web site of your
own, you may want to include these links.  If you find other links that
should be here, please email
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">me</a>.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the web still lacks a comprehensive libertarian
FAQ, one that has short but compelling answers to tough questions on all
aspects of libertarian theory and policy proposals, complete with
footnotes.  That this doesn't already exist is a crying shame, given the
many libertarian thinktanks, books, and the excellent scholarship that
is going on worldwide. Ideally, such a site might even allow people to
submit questions and/or answers that could then be incorporated into the
FAQ. If you have the talent and the dedication to develop and maintain
such a site, the world needs you at least as much as a good five-cent
cigar.</p>

<p>The following links are a good start for such a compilation, and I
congratulate and thank the folks who developed them ...</p>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Gift ideas</h2>
<p>Last updated 11/2/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here are some gift ideas for people who are not necessarily 
libertarian.  I have broken them down by age group.  Most of them are 
books with some kind of libertarian themes.  Many of these books can be 
found in either your local book store or can be ordered from 
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LaissezFaire.html">Laissez-Faire Books</a>,
1-800-326-0996.  You ought to be familiar with the 
book before you decide to give it, of course.  Make sure it's appropriate.</p>

<h3>Young Children (5 - 9)</h3>

<ul>
<li>"The Little Red Hen" (traditional story)</li>
<li>"The Three Little Pigs"</li>
<li>"The Ant and the Grasshopper"</li>
<li>"The Emperor's New Clothes"</li>
<li>"Robin Hood" (be sure it specifies that he's returning the <em>tax</em>
money to the poor)</li>
<li><cite>Little House on the Prairie</cite> (Laura Ingalls Wilder
series of books)</li>
<li><cite>Yankee Doodle: A Revolutionary Tail</cite> by Gary Chalk $14.95</li>
<li><cite>The Butter Battle Book</cite> by Dr. Seuss</li>
<li><cite>Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose</cite> by Dr. Seuss</li>
<li>big piggy bank (Statue of Liberty?) with some bright shiny hard cold 
cash in it!</li>
<li><p><cite>Songs from Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood</cite> (on tape, for use
in the car and at home).</p>
<p>I've always been a big fan of Mr. Rogers, and my 2-year old son loves
Mr. Rogers, as I did until the age of 6 or so.  As a parent, I
appreciate the topics covered in his songs.  They foster genuine
self-esteem: the joy of doing things for yourself, the joy of trying
hard and doing your best, the importance of not hiding your true
feelings, dealing with childhood fears, etc. Comedians like to make fun
of Mr. Rogers, but his show is not smarmy or cloying, it is just gentle
and calm. It deals with real issues of concern and interest to young
children.</p>
<p>As a libertarian, I appreciate that Mr. Rogers, unlike other childrens'
shows, actually <em>celebrates</em> capitalism and individual
achievement by showing lots of film clips about how things are
manufactured, and profiles people with special talents (Yo Yo Ma, Itzhak
Perlman, athletes, astronauts, etc.)  One of his puppet characters is a
genial factory owner who manufactures rocking chairs and is proud of his
product, and one of his live characters (Mr. McFeeley) runs a <em>private</em>
delivery service.  How much more libertarian can you get? &lt;G&gt; Seriously,
I've read "Mr. Rogers Talks With Parents" (a great book gift for
parents, by the way) and thinks that it is very important for children
to understand that people make and do interesting things in their lives.</p>
<p>Now, if only we could privatize the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting...</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Kids (10 - 14)</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Stock. Framed stock certificates from a "cool" company.  Find out what 
product -- music, toys, candy, TV show, computers -- the kid loves and 
let her become an owner of the company that brings it to her: Warner 
Brothers, M&M Mars, Disney, Mattel, etc.  (It'd be nice if you also 
gave a sample of their beloved product as well as the most recent 
annual stockholder report!)  In the accompanying card (which you'll 
tuck into the most recent stockholder report), you include a clipping 
from the newspaper showing how the stock traded that day so she can 
then track it herself.  You inscribe the card with something to the 
effect that she now owns the company!  Finally,  if you have an 
annoyingly leftist sister-in-law, buy her kids stock in General 
Electric, McDonell-Douglas, or some other defense contractor and 
include a cool poster of a warplane in action. &lt;g&gt;</p>

<li><p>"Monthly Money" family allowance/finance system $19.95.
(call Rhyne Precious Metals 800-547-4848 for info.)</p>

<li><p><cite>Capitalism for Kids</cite> by Karl Hess (cool money-making
ideas)</p></li>

<li><p><cite>Animal Farm</cite> by George Orwell</p></li>

<li><p><cite>Diary of Anne Frank</cite></p></li>
</ul>

<h3>High School and College (15 - 20)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Stocks in a cool company (see above.)</li>
<li>Gold/silver coins and coin jewelry (call Rhyne Precious Metals 
800-547-4848 for catalog.)</li>
<li>Buy your budding environmentalist a chunk of wetlands through Ducks 
Unlimited and give her the book "Free Market Environmentalism" by 
Anderson & Leal.  Careful, though, some groups (like Nature 
Conservancy) are evil sleazes that ought not to be supported, i.e., 
they often use government coercion to get what they want.</li>
<li><cite>1984</cite> by George Orwell</li>
<li><cite>Anthem</cite> <cite>The Fountainhead</cite>, or
<cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite> by Ayn Rand (will be offensive to religious
kids, though)</li>
<li><cite>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</cite>, <cite>Double Star</cite>
and <cite>The Expanded Universe</cite> by Robert Heinlein</li>
<li><cite>Parliament of Whores</cite> by P.J. O'Rourke</li>
<li><cite>All The Trouble in the World</cite> by P.J. O'Rourke</li>
<li>Gift subscription to <cite>Reason</cite> (if appropriate)</li>
</ul>

800-547-4848 for catalog.)</li>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Letter-writing campaigns</h2>
<p>Last updated 3/4/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here are some ideas that might get more people (like me) to act on your 
letter-writing "calls to action."</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make your subject line give an indication of the urgency. Indicate 
the deadline up front. Otherwise, people like me will either assume 
that it's too late or that they can put it off.</p></li>

<li><p>The very first sentences of your post should tell lamebrains like 
me <em>exactly</em> what you want us to do. Most people only read the first 
few sentences of any post, so you better put your important stuff 
there. Keep it short and simple.  Put the background info at the bottom 
of the post.</p>
</ol>

<p>Consider using this formula in your "call to action" posts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From: Tom "Watchdog" Isenberg<br>
Subject: DUE 7/26: write letters re: gun law<br>
(indicates deadline, topic, and action required)</p>

<p>Please take a moment to fire off a letter to local editors regarding 
jury nullification and how it would have prevented the jury's tragic, 
reluctant conviction of a local woman on marijuana charges.</p>

<p>Please do this asap. The issue will no longer be timely after 7/26/94.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's the background info:  Most of you have read the horrible 
story about... [etc.]</p>

<p>TIPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must give your full name, address, and daytime phone number for 
verification.</li>
<li>Be clear and concise. No more than 250 words.</li>
<li>Identify yourself as a Libertarian, if you wish. E.g., "As a 
Libertarian, I think that..."</li>
</ul>

<p>TALKING POINTS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Juries have the right to acquit defendants for whatever reason they 
want (e.g., the law is unjust) regardless of what the judge instructs. 
This is a well-established legal principle.</li>
<li>People who want more info should call the Libertarian Party at 
1-800-353-1776.</li>
<li>Jury nullification is a common law right with a long history in this
country.</li>
<li>Jury nullification helped lead to repeal of Prohibition and fugitive 
slave laws.</li>
<li>Jury nullification is the ultimate check and balance against our
government.</li>
</ul>

<p>ADDRESSES:</p>
<p>[Here's where you'd list the mail, fax, and email addresses of the 
papers you want people to write.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want people to take action, you must tell them exactly what to 
do and how to do it.  Make it easy for them!</p>

<h2>Letters to the Editor</h2>
<p>Last updated 1/23/96 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<h3>Top Ten Keys to Successful Letters-to-the-Editor</h3>

<p>by Vernon Imrich</p>

<ol>
<li><p>KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE!  - This is by far the most important thing. You 
have to know what kinds of thing that particular publication thinks is 
important.  This means that you have to read that paper's editorials -- 
a lot.  (If you don't read left-wing or other opponent papers, I 
suggest you start. Fighting idealogical battles requires lots of enemy 
intelligence, besides, you get soft and coddled reading only the stuff 
you agree with all the time.)</p>

<p>Examples:  My "profiles" of local papers</p>

<p>The Boston Globe - leftwing, but a major paper, likes to think it is 
not "censorsing" opposing views, wants "real" feedback limited space 
(see below).</p>

<p>The Tech - MIT's blandest of the bland paper.  They are just happy to 
know someone reads them.  Spit on a piece of paper and they'll print 
it.  good place to start.</p>

<p>The Thistle - MIT's left wing admittedly biased rag.  Have to think 
like a liberal, and pick your issues (see below).</p>

<li><p>REACT TO THEIR PUBLICATION - Papers want to see that they are 
generating debate, that people are excited about them, and most of all, 
that you are reading them.  Quote their text, and <em>always</em> cite their 
articles or editorials as starting points.</p>

<li><p>BE DIRECT - Papers want clarity.  If you disagree, everyone had 
better know you disagree in the first sentence.  No hemming and hawing, 
whining, or complaing.  Tell them: you disagree, here's why, end of story.</p>

<li><p>NO LONGER THAN IS NECESSARY - For most "real world" publications 
this means no more than a paragraph or two.  Do this exercise:  try 
typing out a few paragraphs from an editorial or column and see how 
much shorter the thing seems on your page than in the newspaper.  Next 
do the following.  <em>Read</em> the thing you just typed.  How fast did you 
lose interest?  Chances are if they were long winded and you disagreed 
you stopped before it finished.  People are busy, the press knows this. 
 Remember, these are the people who gave us "sound bites." In general I 
write it out, and then just strip, strip, strip it down to the barest
minimum.</P>

<p>For college publications these rules are different.  MIT's paper 
frequently publishes "essay length" letters and often hosts debates in 
a near USENET fashion with letters answering letters.  This is <em>not</em> the 
case elsewhere.</p>

<li><p>PICK A NARROW TARGET - because of 3 and 4, you simply cannot hope to 
cover everything in any kind of a cogent or supported  fashion.  
Therefore, pick a <em>small</em> piece of the issue, target it well and hit 
hard.  People reading their morning paper with a donut probably can't 
digest a treatise on the fallacies of gun control anway.</p>

<li><p>DO NOT SAY ONE SINGLE THING YOU CANNOT ABSOLUTELY BACK UP!  - this 
is  the easiest way to get killed in letter writing.  You can write a 
Bible full of gospel truth, but if one fact is off, one tiny digression 
is not supported quite well enough, respondents will dismiss the 99% 
and take on the 1% you flubbed up.  I would not use any fact for which 
I could not personally cite the reference (and that reference better be 
something credible to non-libertarians).  And if you <em>do</em> have them ready 
you can really slam dunk any doubters.</p>

<p>Example: I asserted that only 40% of the budget goes to defense and 
debt (roughly 20% for each).  Someone wrote back claiming it was thirty 
for each, meaning 60% of the budget went to defense and debt "that 
mostly paid for military build up anyway."  I hit him with the latest 
budget figures from UPI (18% military, 14% debt) and never heard back ;)</p>

<p>For papers like the Globe (that don't generally print responses to 
other letters) this is still important.  Their editors know what facts 
are true and what aren't.  They see one thing wrong and bye-bye.</p>

<li><p>DO NOT PREJUDICE YOURSELF - Statements like "as a libertarian" 
should come at the end unless they are in direct response to something 
(e.g. in this case, an article about libertarians).  You want people to 
read what you have to say first and then find out who
you are.  That way, they will read the argument and say "so that's what 
libertarians think" rather than saying "uh oh, another one of those 
libertarian nuts is ranting again" and then read the peice through 
colored lenses.  How would you read a letter that began "As a liberal..."?</p>

<li><p>BE REASONABLE - you can be animated, and assertive without sounding 
like a raving nut.  Think about what you are saying.  Write out the 
file and then leave it for a while.  Come back to it later, or let 
others read it too.  Control those emotions.  Use them, but
control them.  (Note: the leave-and-come-back is a good way to check 
for lots of errors.  Many times, your mind thinks a certain way and 
leaves out important things.  After lunch you will notice things that 
don't make as much sense as they first did.)</p>

<li><p>ADVANCED TOPIC: BE COLORFUL OR DIFFERENT - Can be very difficult to 
do given the space restrictions and need for being direct, but can be 
very useful.  Papers generally use only a "sampling" of opinion.  This 
means they notice letters with catchy lines or good wit.  Use vibrant 
verbs and adjectives.  If a plan is bad, don't say "bad" say 
"preposterous." Other good words are "outraged," "a nightmare," or 
"immense," instead of "angry," "a mistake," and "big."  Be careful, 
this can be dangerous.  The lines between clever and stupid, or 
colorful and insane are very thin, always err on the side of rational 
boring and reasonable.</p>

<li><p>ADVANCED TOPIC: GETTING ON ENEMY TURF - One of the most delightful 
and challenging aspects of letter writing is seeing if you can get past 
the mental firewalls of various publications.  To do this you need a 
good understanding of what motivates their reasoning.  When this is 
grasped you can use that motivation, twist it a little and have them 
caught in an idealogical web.  At the very least they will print the 
letter, assuming it a reasonable objection from a devoted follower.</p>

<p>Example:  To get my letter in the Thistle (MIT's "commie rag") on the 
issue of free speech (note, by knowing my audience, I knew this was one 
of the only issues I could use), I cited the "thirty years of fighting" 
for free speech on campus and how I was proud of my Berkeley days (I 
was there as an undergrad).  From there I stated how sad I was that 
these "bastions of speech supporters" were now the very ones arguing 
for speech codes. Hypocrisy or not, people are not going to toss out 
sentiment or history.  Also, if you know modern liberal thought, they 
<em>love</em> appeals to history as justification.</p>

<p>Example: One of the letters to the Boston Globe (attached below) that 
was printed was on gun control.  Now the Globe is one of the  most 
overtly biased gun-grabbing outfits there is.  But they do have a 
deference for the Supreme Court (most of its rulings have helped 
liberal causes in recent years) and due process.  Also I noticed an 
editorial appeal to Madison once on a constitutional issue.  Thus, my 
letter didn't actually ask for a change of heart on guns, but appealed 
to due process to try to force the hardest path on to gun control 
advocates (constitutional amendment).  And of course, a tidy little 
Madison quote finished it off.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>

<p>In "A Starting Point on Guns" (Globe Dec. 4) Mr. Ryan makes the 
faulty assertion that assault weapons belong only in "the military; the 
locked cabinets of SWAT teams; or puerile fantasy."   The fact is, the 
2nd Amendment was written to prevent just this kind of state monopoly 
on deadly force.</p>
     <p>According to Thomas Jefferson, "The strongest reason for people to 
retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect 
themselves against tyranny in government."  The framers wanted military 
power vested in the militia which (in both the National Guard Act of 
1903 and the Militia Act of 1792) "shall consist of every able-bodied 
male citizen."  In fact, in deciding that a certain weapon was <em>not</em> 
protected by the 2nd Amendment, the U.S. Supreme Court reasoned that it 
could not consider it  "any part of the ordinary military equipment" 
(U.S. v. Miller Et. Al. 1939).</p>
     <p>Reasonable people may disagree with Jefferson and the framers, but 
at least try to show more respect for the Bill of Rights.  Either 
accept what it means or follow the process to amend it.  Don't degrade 
it with what Madison called "the gradual and silent encroachment of 
those in power."</p>

<title>Lobbying</title>

<body>

<h1>Politics Without Holding Office</h1>

<p>May 1993, from Bryan Griffin (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:bwg@csn.org">bwg@csn.org</a>):</p>

<p>I would like people to consider what will happen if for example we do elect
one congressperson. What will this person spend their time doing? They will
come up with libertarian legislation, and need to spend time trying to lobby
all the other congresspeople to vote for it since one person can not pass a
law. Even if we got several libertarians into office, they would still need to
go through the same process. My question is, how different really is the 0
people in office case from the 1 person in office case? In congress, and in
state legislatures, one vote doesn't mean much. Its possible to draft bills and
lobby legislators without being in office. The same sort of research and
lobbying support that would be required with a person in office can be useful
even without an officeholder.</p>

<p>It is true that a congress person (or state legislator) can actually propose
a bill. However  1 legislator can only introduce so many bills, and most of the
work in getting something passed is done after the bill is introduced anyway.
Most of what will be done once 1 legislator is elected to office, proposing
concrete solutions to problems and lobbying other lawmakers, can be done with 0
legislators in office. If it isn't possible to find a non-libertarian
legislator to introduce a particular piece of legislation, then it probably
wouldn't have been possible to get it passed even if we had 1 person in
office.</p>

<p>The national party may not be involved in local politics, but it needs to
support and encourage local activities to help build the national party.   In
much of the country the LP does not act much like a true political party in
that it doesn't attempt any direct influence on the political process other
than an attempt at election time. People don't go and speak up at city council
meetings, or other public government events. One of the reasons for this is
that much of what goes on is boring, especially to people who don't really wish
the government to do much, and its hard to find people to commit the time
required. One solution may be to get signup sheets and get people to share the
work, each person volunteering to cover a council meeting once in a while. If
individual issues are chosen then the work on those issues can be distributed
and shared, instead of requiring one person to devote enough time to serve as a
candidate and officeholder.</p>

<p>If you give people some concrete active task, which requires only a small,
well defined commitment of time  (even just outreach stuff like manning booths,
or stuffing envelopes, if not front line political lobbying) they may be
willing to get involved. Open ended commitments to being responsible for a
particular area aren't as easy for people to make. Anyone who has tried asking
for contributions in a meeting will know that it is much easier to get people
to contribute money for a concrete purpose than just the group in general. The
point is that people are also more likely to contribute time to concrete well
defined tasks than taking an ill-defined task such as being an officer or
leading some sub-group.</p>

<h2>Outreach to Corporate VIPs</h2>
<p>Last updated 10/29/91 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here's something we at Microsoft have recently done...</p>

<p>We've got both the <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html>Reason
Foundation</a> and the <a href="/revolution/by_name/C/Cato.html">Cato
Institute</a> to send free
subscriptions to policy analyses and special reports and invitations to
conferences to several Microsoft zillionaires who have shown interest in
or sympathy towards libertarian ideals (as judged by Microsoft
libertarians who have had dealings with these people.)</p>

<p>Each of these gifts will come with cards and cover letters from the
respective organizations mentioning that the gifts are from the
Microsoft libertarians (to show that some of their highly intelligent
and highly productive employees are looking out for their bosses'
intellectual development.)</p>

<p>We also discussed with Cato and Reason an idea to invite these
zillionaires to speak at conferences on issues like "the wonderfully
unregulated computer industry" "computers and the revolution in Eastern
Europe" "marketing in post-communist Europe" "computers, technology, and
freedom" and so forth.</p>

<p>So those of you working near other zillionaires might want to consider
doing something similar... At least get your company library to stock up
on some CATO books and studies of general corporate interest (<cite>The
Suicidal Corporation</cite>, for example.)</p>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Radio Interviews</h2>
<p>Last updated 7/28/84 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>A much-touted, highly publicized poll in 1991 showed that only 28% of 
those surveyed trust the government to, by-and-large, do the right 
thing. This is half of the percentage in 1961. Add to this cover 
stories in Newsweek "Voters want No Bull" and Time "Is Government 
Dead?" and we seem to have fertile ground for the LP.</p>

<p>Some analysts are saying that voters don't necessarily want less 
government, they want <em>better</em> government (one which gives the middle 
class the goodies it wants: health care, tax cuts, etc.)</p>

<p>This is a dangerous combination. If Libertarians don't articulate real 
solutions, the Democratic Socialists will. And big government is 
appealing to many people. Let's at least create some doubts.</p>

<p>This is an ideal time to contact your local talk radio station and get 
them to interview an articulate libertarian. Most talk radio stations 
will do long-distance telephone interviews, so if you don't have a 
strong local propagandist, refer them to someone from <a
href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html">Reason</a> or <a
href="/revolution/by_name/C/Cato.html">Cato</a> or 
the National LP. Have a list of contacts and numbers for them (see below.)</p>

<p>Get some other libertarians to call in and ask for coverage of this 
Libertarian thing.</p>

<p>Let's exploit every opportunity we have.</p>

<p>Libertarian contacts:
<a href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWinter.html">Bill Winter</a> (Libertarian
Party, Wash, DC) 202-543-1988;
Erica Hartig (Cato Institute, Wash, DC) 202-546-0200;
Kevin Teasely (Reason Foundation, Los Angeles) 1-800-341-1522.</p>

<title>High School Libertarians</title>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Ten Things High School Libertarians Can Do</h2>
<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<P>Do you want to get some scholarship money for college, impress people of
the opposite gender, disarm your intellectual opponents while
simultaneously winning their admiration and eternal gratitude? Sure, we
all do. Here's how.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Educate yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read.  You probably don't have much time to read, what with homework
and romance and all, but if you do, some good introductions to
libertarianism include: <cite>Why Government Doesn't Work</cite> by
Harry Browne, <cite>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</cite> by Ayn Rand,
<cite>Restoring the American Dream</cite> by Robert Ringer, and <cite>The
Machinery of Freedom</cite> by David
Friedman.  The Ringer book is out of print, but you can find it in most
used book stores.  It's a great book, so if you can't find it, email me
and I'll see if I have a spare copy to send you for $5. The other books
can be found or ordered in any bookstore.  And, of course, there are
lots of great libertarian web sites to read (see below.)</p>

<li><p>Get the free Laissez-Faire books catalog. This is the best source for
books of interest to libertarians. Request a free catalog by calling
them at 1-800-326-0996 or check out their web site at http://www.lfb.org</p>

<li><p>Create your own Q&A file.  As a libertarian, you probably get asked a
lot of questions by friends, family, teachers, and others.  You may find
that your history and economics textbooks are somewhat biased in favor
of big government (textbooks are written for use in government schools,
after all.)  Some questions you'll be able to answer, others you might
not.  Don't sweat it. Just say, "That's a good question, I'll have to
get back to you on that."  And do it.  Write down the question and do
some reading on it (or email me if you want.)  Better yet, ask a real
expert at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy
http://www.mackinac.org/askthe.htm ("Expert help is only 24 hours
away.")  You might start your own "Question and Answer" file to keep
track of tough questions, statistics, etc.  Mine is a simple Microsoft
Word document (in outline format) arranged alphabetically by category
(e.g., Drug Policy, Education, Environment, Gun Control, Laissez Faire
Myths, etc.)  In each section I write in bold text the common questions
or talking points (e.g., "Doesn't capitalism destroy the environment?")
followed by short answers or "sound bites" including references.  By
keeping such a file, I'm able to sharpen my answers (and I find that I
remember them better.)  Plus, these answers are easy to "recycle" when
you get into email debates, write reports, write letters to the editor,
call talk shows, etc.</p>
</ul>

<li><p>Add libertarian links to your web page.
Here are some great libertarian links you may already know about:
http://www.self-gov.org/quiz.html = an online "Nolan chart" survey that
tells you whether you're a libertarian, conservative, liberal, or ...?
http://www.audionet.com/shows/ponte/ = The Lowell Ponte Show (an archive
of this Libertarian's nationwide daily talkshow).  To listen to it, your
computer must have audio capability (duh) and you must first download
the free RealAudio software.
http://www.free-market.com/ = the Mother of All Libertarian Resources on
the Web, including thinktanks, academic resources, etc.</p>

<li><p>Bug Your School Librarian.
See if your school library has the books mentioned above. If not, ask
the library to buy them (so that future students can benefit.)  Also,
ask them to subscribe to the two best libertarian magazines for
students: Reason and The Freeman.  You may need to show them copies
before they agree to subscribe.  You can email me for free copies of
both.  If your librarian won't purchase these items, ask if s/he'll
accept donated subscriptions and books.  If so, contact your local
Libertarian Party and ask someone to donate one or more of these items
to your school library (I'm sure they'd love to.)</p>

<li><p>Use Your School Newspaper.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Put a copy of the Nolan survey in the school newspaper.  This is a
simple way to introduce many people to libertarian ideas.  Just download
a copy of the survey and get the school newspaper to print it (maybe
they can do it as a school-wide opinion poll.)  Or get your Civics
teacher to put a copy on the classroom wall.  Or just have your friends
do it.  Again, that link is http://www.self-gov.org/quiz.html.  If you
don't have access to the web, email me and I'll send you a copy of the
quiz.</p>

<li><p>Write editorials.  If you like to write, consider writing an
occasional "libertarian" editorial for the school newspaper.  Hell, a
few people might even read it.</p>
</ul>

<li><p>Invite LP Speakers to Your Class.
Call up your local Libertarian Party (they're in the phone book) and ask
if they have speakers available to come speak to your Civics or Social
Studies class.  If they do, pass that person's name and number to your
teacher and encourage him to invite the speaker for all of his classes
for the day.  Your teacher will be able to take the classes off, and you
won't have any homework assignments.  What a deal.</p>

<li><p>Organize Debates.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you're really motivated and can use some extra-credit points, you
can organize after-school debates, maybe once every semester (assuming
you can't get your Civics teacher to just do these debates in class.)
Pick one or two highly controversial issues that would attract an
audience (legalizing drugs, gun control, censorship, etc.) Organize your
team to present the libertarian position ("As a libertarian, I think
that..."), and invite another team to present the opposing position.
Have a teacher help you organize the debate and act as the moderator.
And if I were organizing this, I would invite some of the smarter
cheerleaders to do some hilarious "debate" cheers for each side before
it presents its opening argument. But I'm weird that way.</p>

<li><p>If you can't get people interested in the above, see if you can get
your school involved in the nation-wide Lincoln-Douglas high school
debate program. For more info, call 1-800-884-2189 or email
grehmke@free-enterprise.org or check out the web site at
http://www.free-enterprise.org/eahome.htm . The bi-monthly debate topics
typically feature issues of interest to libertarians, and the Free
Enterprise Institute features all kinds of free study materials to help
present the libertarian argument.</p>
</ul>

<li><p>Organize a Production of "Night of January 16th".
If you're into theater, you could get your school's theater group to
consider doing a production of Ayn Rand's play "Night of January 16th."
The basic plot is a murder trial where the audience is the jury and
actually returns a verdict.  The play has different endings, depending
on the verdict. Themes in the play include individualism, etc. You can
find the play in any bookstore.  This play is popular with High Schools
because it is highly entertaining, relatively easy to produce, and not
too long. If your school does do it, you might volunteer to write the
"liner notes" for the play, mentioning Rand's other novels with
"libertarian themes."</p>

<li><p>Do Projects on Libertarian Themes.
If you have a class assignment that lends itself, or can use some
extra-credit points, consider doing a presentation or report on a
libertarian theme.  For Civics class, you could present the Nolan Chart
as a better way of viewing politics than the one-dimensional Left/Right
spectrum or you could present the platform and history of the
Libertarian Party.  For English class, you could do a book report on an
Ayn Rand novel ("Anthem" is a popular one because it is short and has
some great themes.)</p>

<li><p>Hook up with College Libertarian Groups.
Here are some directories of college groups.  Sometimes libertarians
call themselves "classical liberals" so search on that as well.
http://www.libertarian.com/wwlp/st/
http://www.free-market.com//student.html</p>

<li><p>Check Our These Scholarships for High School Students.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Free Enterprise Institute offers the "Economics in One Lesson"
Scholarship Program with an annual (?) essay contest open to all high
school students. Based on journalist Henry Hazlitt's classic Economics
in One Lesson, students compete for $7,500 in college scholarships. For
more info, call 1-800-884-2189 or email grehmke@free-enterprise.org or
check out the web site at http://www.free-enterprise.org/eolhome.htm to
see last year's info.</p>

<li><p>For Oregon high school-age students, the Cascade Policy Institute
offers the third annual Independence Essay Competition "Exploring the
Foundations of Freedom." Up to $5,000 in total prizes to be awarded for
the best essays on the Bill of Rights. Deadline this year is March 3,
1997.  For more info, call 503-242-0900 or email
Essay97@CascadePolicy.org or check out the web site at
http://www.cascadepolicy.org/essay/essay97.htm.</p>

students, please email me.</p>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Bumperstickers</h2>
<p>Last updated 11/24/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>In my humble opinion, every Libertarian ought to have one of these 
bumperstickers on their car. It's free publicity and helps to make the 
LP a household word.</p>

<p>The best (and also the most popular) are "Legalize Freedom" and 
"Pro-Choice on Everything" because they look good (they're red, white & 
blue), get the point across, and feature the 1-800 number.</p>

<p>Just put them on your car's back window (for easy peel-off removal when 
you sell your car) and become a mobile advertisement for truth, 
justice, and the American way. It's an excellent conversation starter, 
and you'll even get some thumbs-up on the road (I average about a dozen 
a year.)  I even keep a few extras in the car to give away.</p>

<p>State and local LP organizations should give them away for free, not 
sell them! Think of it this way: they are mobile billboards. So why not 
maximize the number of billboards out there? Subsidize their cost some 
other way. You can order them in quantity discount from the National 
LP. Order with VISA or MasterCard by calling 202-543-1988. Give them 
away at meetings, conventions, and <a href="booths.html">Nolan survey
booths</a>.</p>

<h3>To Make Your Own Bumperstickers</h3>

<p>Williams & Macias sells a glossy paper stock that lets you print bumper 
stickers from an ordinary laser printer.</p>

<p>Product 2041 has 3 stickers on a 8.5 x 11 sheet (somewhat small for a 
bumpersticker), Product 2042 has 2 stickers on a 8.5 x 11 sheet.</p>

<p>Both products have a weatherproof adhesive, and are made from 
weather-resistant paper.  The products come in 20-sheet packs.  Both 
versions are $19/pack.  Obviously, you should do test runs on normal 
paper before using the sticker paper.  So -- a fast and cheap way to 
crank out small runs of black and white bumper stickers (or use a color 
printer at Kinko's Copy Center.)</p>

<p>The phone number is (800) 310-0890 or (509) 624-5170.</p>

<p>And here's another service, as advertised in LP News:</p>

<p>BUMPERSTICKERS  Made to Order - Quantity 1 to 50
Ideal for local issues and campaigns or just to try out a new slogan 
(No Profanity). 24 Color combinations. Text color (pick one): Red, 
Orange, Green, Blue, White, Yellow. Background Color (pick one): Black,

is $1.00 per bumpersticker. Send your name, address, phone, text, color 
choices, quantity, and payment to <a

<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>If you have an event that you think C-SPAN should cover (debate, 
campaign speech for a statewide or Congressional race, conference, 
etc.) give their assignment desk a call: 202-626-7979.</p>

<p>C-SPAN has been very friendly to Libertarians, they've covered speeches 
by Libertarian candidates, the LP Convention, and other things.  If 
your campus group wants to sponsor an academic panel forum (or debate 
or lecture) on some libertarian issue, this would be an ideal way to 
get coverage.</p>

<p>C-SPAN can be reached on email at <img src="/images/mail.gif"

<h2>College Libertarian Activism</h2>
<p>Last updated 1/12/97 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<P>I think that college groups are the most important front in the libertarian
movement.  The most important function of a college group is not
to establish a small club of libertarians who discuss libertarian theory, but
to expose the entire campus community to the libertarian message.
Unfortunately, most college groups fall into the trap of becoming miniscule
debate societies and not doing any outreach (Nolan booths being the most
efficient way to find new libertarians.)  I think this is a tremendous waste
of an opportunity.  That's why I strongly advise against setting up monthly
discussion meetings.  The point is to do outreach, not drink beer with
the choir.</P>

<hr><h3>Run Regular Nolan Booths and Introductory Seminars</h3>

<p>I would argue that a college group should do nothing else until it is
successfully running a "Nolan survey" booth every month and at least one
introductory seminar on "What is the Libertarian Party?" every semester.  A
Nolan booth, by the way, is basically a survey table that lets passersby give
their opinion on political issues.  You use this booth, not to debate or to
convert, but to discover who on campus is already a "libertarian" (at least
philosophically.)  You collect the names and addresses of these libertarian
sympathizers and later on you invite them to the introductory seminar.  Of
course, you can hand out introductory literature at the booth as well.</p>

<P>You can get bulk literature from the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">National LP</a> (your state LP
may have some pamphlets gathering dust, so give them a call first.)  I
recommend that you hand out the "Libertarian Party Special Report" booklet
available from the National LP.  It is advertised in the LP NEWS along
with some other well-done literature.  The
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/ISIL.html">International Society for
Individual Liberty (ISIL)</a> also publishes an excellent
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.creative.net/~star/pamph.htm">series of pamphlets</a>.</p>

<hr><h3>Stock the University Library</h3>

<p>Does your library stock your favorite libertarian books, journals, and
magazines?  If not, find out how to submit purchase requests.  Also ask
if the library will accept gift subscriptions and purchases, and if so,
contact the author or publisher to get free copies/subscriptions.
Frankly, I can't imagine
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/Liberty.html"><cite>Liberty</cite></a>
or <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html"><cite>Reason</cite></a>
or <a href="/revolution/by_name/C/Cato.html">Cato</a> refusing to donate
subscriptions to university libraries willing to display them (it's a
great way to get in front of future subscribers and donors.)  Or you can
contact your state Libertarian Party (LP) to ask them to make the
donation.</P>

<hr><h3>Bring Speakers to Campus</h3>

<p>For those in your group who are not interested in doing Nolan booths (which
are actually a lot of fun) they can form a committee in charge of bringing
libertarian speakers (authors, thinktankers, etc.) to campus.  Depending on
your college's rules, you may need to form a non-partisan, student group to
access the college's funds and resources to bring these speakers on campus.
So, you might have the Whatsamatta U. Libertarians be the LP group that does
the Nolan booths and you might have the Whatsamatta U. Students for
Individual Liberty be the non-partisan group that uses college funds to bring
libertarian luminaries to campus.</p>

<hr><h3>Write Columns and Commentaries</h3>

<p>An easy way to promote your group is to have your members write
editorials and letters to the campus newspaper or, if anyone actually
listens to it, participate in campus radio (e.g., host a weekly
political talk show.)</p>

<hr><h3>Host Debates</h3>

<p>Another good way to promote your group on campus is to sponsor debates.  Once
a month (or whatever) you can debate a controversial issue.  One of you guys
provides the libertarian position, and a speaker from another campus group
provides the statist position.  Don't set up a three-way debate between
Republicans/Democrats/Libertarians, just do a two-way debate (pro and con.)
Allow the other group to set up their literature table as well.</p>

<hr><h3>Fundraising</h3>

<p>If you need help raising funds (after milking the Student Activities
Office for all it's worth), you should approach the local Libertarians in
your area.  You can get a list of their names and addresses from your
local Libertarian Party.  Better yet, you can put an ad in your state's
LP newsletter.  People would be glad to invest in college LP groups,
especially if you make it clear what you will use the money for (purchase
literature for distribution at our monthly literature booths, etc.)  You
could offer "sponsorships" each academic year: for a donation of $25 or
so, donors would receive notification and invitations of events
(including receptions with the speakers that you invite to campus, etc.)</p>

<hr><h3>Mentors Needed for Campus Groups</h3>

<p>A key to successful and long-lasting college groups is having at least
one dedicated off-campus mentor. If your group doesn't have one, find a
good one now so that your organization doesn't die when the seniors
graduate.  Your mentor may be a faculty member or a dedicated
libertarian.  This person would help organize Nolan booths at the start
of each school year, and be the institutional memory of the group, year
after year.  The mentor would become familiar with university policies
governing your group and would help guide groups through the process.
The mentor could also purchase and own any "durable" goods the group
needs (Nolan booth kits, answering machines, computers, bulk literature,
etc.)</p>

<hr><h3>Other Projects</h3>

<p>Once your group is already doing the high-priority items (Nolan booths and
hosting lectures/debates), you might consider doing some activism focused on
making your University a more libertarian place.  For example, you might work
to repeal bad University policies, like bans on non-lethal weapons (such as
pepper spray) on campus.  Or are students at your campus forced to subsidize
Ralph Nader's PIRG groups?  Probably.  Why not start a project where you
fight this coercive financing?  Here's a quote form a web site that features
lots of <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.realchange.org/nader.htm">dirt on Saint Ralph</a>:
"Penn State's Board of Overseers declined Nader's PIRG group's coercive
funding and voted instead to let students check a box to make a donation
(like presidential campaign funding on 1040 tax forms) -- a perfectly
reasonable compromise."</p>

<hr><h3>Resources for College Groups</h3>

<p>Here are the email addresses of others involved in campus Libertarian clubs.
A good place to start is to get yourself on the mailing list for the
Libertarian Student Club E-mail Network. (Contact the LSCEN e-mail network at
<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:mcpherso@lumina.ucsd.edu">mcpherso@lumina.ucsd.edu</a>.)</p>

<p>Also, check out the following Web sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
	href="http://www.auburn.edu/student_info/libertarians/au_libert.html">Auburn University Libertarians</a></li>
<li><img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
	href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~ihs/">Institute for Humane Studies</a></li>
<li><img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
	href="http://www.mit.edu:8001/activities/libertarians/lscwn.html">Libertarian Student Club WWW Network</a></li>
<li><img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
	href="http://darwin.clas.virginia.edu/~liberty">Students for
	Individual Liberty</a></li>
</ul>

<p>By the way, I have several college-organizing handbooks that I can photocopy
and send to you.  Copying and postage should cost about $10, so if you want
them, e-mail me.</p>

<title>County LPs</title>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>County LP improvements</h2>
<p>Last updated 11/6/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>This was formerly "Local LP improvements"...</p>

<p>The general suggestions I have are these:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Job number one is finding new Libertarians via <a
href="booths.html">Nolan booths</a>.
Everything else is of much less importance and is probably diverting 
energy from this most crucial activity.  Growing the party is job one.  
Get the names, addresses, and phone numbers of all prospects to the 
state party so they can be added to the mailing list.</p>

<li><p>Supper clubs and <a href="newsletters.html">newsletters</a> may be
fun, but if you aren't doing 
regular Nolan booths (at least once a month on a local college campus, 
mall, gun show, etc.) they are a dead-end.  Worse, most local 
newsletters look awful.  They do more harm to the Party than good.  I 
think it's better to have <em>no</em> newsletter than to have the usual crappy 
one.  Leave the newsletter to the state party.</p></li>

<li><p>Every month, have the state LP office send you a list of new 
prospects/members in your county so you can update your county 
database.  Call up every prospect and member and survey them regarding 
their level of interest, volunteering, etc.  For a copy of the survey 
we use in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a> state,
contact me.</p></li>

<li><p>Look and act professional when whenever you represent the LP.  That 
means dress well (business suits).  Make sure that all candidates 
follow this rule even more strictly, and never let the media think you 
are a bunch of hippies or worse.  People will take unconventional ideas 
from conventional looking people, but not unconventional ideas from 
unconventional people.</p></li>

<li><p>Make sure you have a solid outreach effort to local <a
href="highschools.html">high schools</a>
and colleges (giving talks to classes, etc.)</p></li>

<li><p>Don't invite new members to business meetings where they will be 
bored and just hear about how little money you have and why so-and-so 
is a so-and-so for using Helvetica Bold on the front of the newsletter 
instead of Univers. Instead, invite them to monthly speakers programs 
and to monthly <a href="supperclubs.html">supper clubs</a>, and have
these events well organized and 
designed to give your organization as smooth and professional a look as 
possible.</p></li>

<li><p>Recruit your army before going to war. Try to find people who are 
already libertarians and don't know it before trying to do massive 
education efforts. Nolan survey booths and the like are good for this.</p></li>

<li><p>Keep everyone enthusiastic. You should set achievable goals and 
achieve them; it keeps people thinking that they are doing some good. 
Don't set unachievable goals; keep things realistic.</p></li>

<li><p>Don't be a jerk. Don't do things to drive new potential recruits 
away, and don't do things to make people think you are a crackpot. 
Listen to a "Liberty Communicator" audio tape course from Advocates for 
Self Government (1-800-932-1776 for a free catalog); it may be one of 
the most valuable things you do.</p></li>

<li><p>Above all, talk to the people who have done this already. Call up 
<a href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWinter.html">Bill Winter</a>, the
Communications Director at LPHQ (202-543-1988). He's a 
nice guy, and his information is very very very useful.  This is the 
single best piece of advice I have!</p></li>

<li><p>Learn from the major parties.  This may be a heretical suggestion, 
but I think it's sheer brilliance:  become your precinct's committee 
officer for the Republican (or Democratic) party.  You will get all 
kinds of useful information, training, and experience.  Not to mention 
the voting lists for people in your precinct that you can pass along to 
the LP.  Get involved in the local Republican party.  Attend their 
meetings, see how they do things.  We need that kind of experience and 
training.</p></li>

<title>Fundraising</title>

<h1>Fundraising and Membership Ideas</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/G/MatthewGaylor.html">Matthew
Gaylor</a>:</p>

<p>The following are the better responses to a survey asking for ideas
that generate money, members and/or votes.</p>

<ol>
<li>Talk Radio appearances (mentioned by many
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Dallas.html">Dallas</a>
 activists as their first
indication that LP is in town). LP name and phone must be repeated, of course.
<li>Op-eds.  Effective mainly in wealthy north suburbs, where younger people
actually read.
<li>Voter's Guides  (although phone # in phone book must be right for this to
work...)
</ol>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWalker.html">Bill Walker</a> said:
there is one
strategy I've used to raise money which seems to work very well. And that is to
send a fund-raising letter that promotes a radio or TV ad campaign. In fact,
I've been able to raise money at LP meetings simply by announcing that I'm
putting an ad on the air, and I leave the meeting with upwards of $100 for the
ads. It seems to me that Libertarians are tired of donating money without 
getting some specific satisfaction in return. I've found that a radio or TV ad
is ideal. Donors know exactly what the money is going towards, they know that
advertising is crucial to increasing membership and most importantly, they have
something to point to (or listen to on their own radios! what a thrill!) that
they can say, "I helped put that there! That's my ad!"</p>

<p>Two important tricks of the trade:</p>
<ol>
<li>Offer a range of recommended donations with associated "premiums." 
For example, everyone who donates at least $25 will get notification of 
when the ads will air. Those who donate at least $50 will also get 
their own tape copy of the ad for use in their own area. Those who 
donate at least $100 (the cost of one ad) will also get an autographed 
copy of <a href="/revolution/by_name/C/EdClark.html">Ed Clark's</a> campaign
book (or some other premium.)
<li>Always send thank you cards to any donor and track their donations 
in the membership/prospect database (total donated so far & date of 
last donation). And make sure you send letters to prospects as well. 
Sometimes give more than members do.
</ol>

<p>I have found that information tables are the most effective method of
increasing the number of voters registered Libertarian in an area.  In
Alachua County, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a>,
we went from 70 registered LP folks in 1989 or so
to 182 in 1993.  We assume that this is due in large part to the tables
since this is an all time high, and that was the time when we started
tabling at the local fair and other libertarian events.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a> said:
For fund raising, putting out a newsletter regularly is good.  Folks like
to see where their money is going.  Also, specific fund raising for
things or events works well.</p>

<p>Jen (<a href="/images/mail.gif" alt=[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:arms45@bikini.cis.ufl.edu">arms45@bikini.cis.ufl.edu</a>) said:
One thing we have started doing here is to get our local newsletter in
gear.  We send it out to every registered libertarian in the county and
every issue has a membership form.  It isn't fancy (1 photocopy sheet,
both sides, tri-folded, bulk mailed) and it doesn't have any articles
that are time consuming to write, just what the local LP is up to and
what happened at the last state LP exec comm meeting.  Also, every copy
has a schedule of events for the next month and phone numbers of who to
contact for more info.</p>

<ol>
<li>Put a method of donation and or membership on every piece of outreach
literature. This is to include a method to reach the organization by mail,
phone, e-mail etc. Also marketing studies have shown that the use of a
telephone icon next to your phone number will increase your call rate by 300%.
<li>Maintain a contact database and keep a handle on who contributes and how
often.  Your database of members,contacts,voters,etc is the most valuable
thing an organization owns.
<li>If possible obtain a 800 number for calls outside of your area.  Its
important to realize that many people like to argue and use the 800 # as an
entertainment device.  Therefore put an answering machine on the line with a
message like the following: "Hello you have reached the Libertarian Party , we
are currently out of the office, if you want some information mailed to you on
the Libertarian Party leave your name, address and phone number, if you need to
speak to a staff member please call (Area code) local number. Thank you."  This
will not only cut your phone bill, keep the 800 line open, but it will also act
as a screening device for the truly interested.

<title>Media Kits</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Media kits and cultivating journalists</h2>
<p>Last updated by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Much of the following information comes from a former journalist who is 
now in public relations.</p>

<p>Q:  What should a media kit include?</p>
<p>A:  It should look professional, not home made.  Include a Nolan Chart 
survey (a.k.a. "The World's Smallest Political Quiz"),  the LP Program 
(not the huge platform), a cover letter, and a reply form which asks 
them whether they'd like to receive a free sampling of libertarian 
magazines (<a href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html">Reason</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LaissezFaire.html">Laissez-Faire Books</a>
catalog, etc.), brochures, and a 
VIP subscription to the state <a href="newsletters.html">newsletter</a> (so
they can keep on top of 
your issues; assuming of course that your state newsletter isn't 
pathetic.)  The form should also have a special space for their 
comments and/or questions (since they're reporters).  Include a 
business reply mail envelope (and fax number) so they'll send in their 
responses.  You can then tailor future contacts and mailings to 
reporters who care enough to respond.</p>

<p>Q:  How can state and local parties develop good relationships with
reporters?</p>
<p>A:  Nobody is run more ragged than the daily or weekly news reporter.  
His/her concentration is 80% on what's happening right now, 10% on what 
happened yesterday, and 10% on backgrounding himself about unfamiliar 
subjects.  Individually, they vary greatly in maturity, self-knowledge, 
and experience.  IF their cynicism is not developed from reporting 
experience, it is a traditional attitude they embrace to fit in with 
their on-staff role models.</P>

<p>They look upon Libertarians as just another political party, and 
individuals within it as "sources".  Developing relationships with 
reporters is the original "double-edged sword".  After awhile, if they 
can't find anything wrong with what you're doing, they may <em>look</em> --- if 
only to tell themselves they are being "objective".  For example, they 
will purposely seek out detractors of Libertarianism for quotes in a 
given story.</P>

<p>Nevertheless, you can bet the Ds & Rs know local reporters by name, 
statewide.  They try their damnedest to cut a reporter out of the 
"herd" and groom him/her for future stories, knowing full well the 
reporter with the most sources wins the newsroom games.  On the other 
hand, if reporters develop a good working knowledge of libertarianism, 
it will affect the very questions they ask their sources, which will 
affect what they write  and in turn what people read every day.  This 
process often occurs without the reporter even being aware of it.</P>

<p>After you send out media kits to journalists who cover "our" beat 
(after the elections), you can call them up and invite them to lunch to 
talk about the local/state LP.  Local Libertarians could develop 
relationships with the reporter as Rs and Ds do.  As I said, this is a 
two-edged sword.  But if local Libertarians become respected 
information sources (reliable = accurate), they will be consulted 
concerning Libertarian views on any number of upcoming official 
decisions or current events.  The local Libertarian should be a
respected fact source even for non-political events.  Reporters, 
remember, also thrive on (1) scoops and (2) feature stories on unique 
persons/interesting events.  Reporters may return the favor when 
steered to a "good" story.</P>

<p>A nurtured respect earns you access to one-on-one coffeetime chats with 
them about politics.  You have the right to state at each clatch what 
is on and off the record.   When a reporter chats with you, he most 
likely will be on duty, covering his beat.  Such coverage includes 
chats over coffee or lunch.  While you are developing the relationship, 
the reporter will be aware of your intent.  It's all right with him <em>if</em> 
you can help make his time profitable in terms of providing highly 
current and often little known facts for his editorial mill.  So be 
prepared in that area, too.  Find out what your reporter's beat is 
(schools, city, etc.) and toss him some story leads whenever you can.  
That is the key.  Daily reporters are cautioned not to accept lunch or 
other favors.  Weekly  reporters are, for the most part, less cautious.</P>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Newsletter ideas</h2>
<p>Last updated 11/6/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>For you current or potential LP newsletter editors out there, here are
a couple of ideas for your consideration.  First, let me say that I
think that newsletters should be left to the state LP.  Many
Libertarians are literary wannabes and the Party suffers from an
abundance of absolutely pitiful local newsletters.</p>

<p>Remember, in politics image is everything.  If our prospects and members
are getting crappy, kooky, amateurish mailings, they'll write us off.  Most
of our prospects and members will get their <em>only</em> impression of the
LP from the stuff we mail them.  If you want to work on a newsletter, work
on your state LP's newsletter.  It can probably stand some improvements.</p>

<p>Remember, there are many affordable newsletter design services out
there.  In fact, the local Kinko's Copy shop provides this service. 
You give them the text, and they lay it out.  It looks great, and you
can use it as a template for future issues.  Whatever it costs, you
will get the money back in future donations from people who weren't
scared off by a pathetic newsletter.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of a Newsletter</h3>

<ol>

<li><p>If you can't say anything nice, shut up!</p>

<p>I believe that the purpose of each LP newsletter is to increase morale,
membership, and donations. When I was editor of the <cite>Washington
Libertarian</cite>, which is now in even better hands, I saw each issue as a
combined  fund-raising letter, membership letter, prospect kit, and
volunteer recruitment appeal. Therefore, I am stunned by the number of
newsletters out there that whine about apathy, do dirty laundry in
public, tear down other Libertarians, etc. Nothing turns off prospects,
members, donors, and volunteers faster! Instead of whining about how no
one volunteers for anything, how about writing an article proposing a
new project?</p>

<p>Impressions are everything, and it is a self-fulfilling
prophecy. If your newsletter focuses only on the good stuff, you'll
find more good people becoming motivated to do more good stuff. If your
newsletter whines and complains and tears down, you will encourage more
of the same. I never published letters that were critical of
libertarians, I never ran kooky ads (e.g., "Get the Facts on Infant
Genital Mutilation!"), and I never used off-color language or material.
We must look as professional as possible, not just to show prospects
and the media that we're serious and worth supporting, but to motivate
our members and volunteers (who are also our donors.)</p>

<li><p>Prospect Page</p>

<p>Since newsletters are often used as an outreach piece (in
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a> we
send it out in our prospect kit and distribute copies to sympathetic
newsstands) we should have a regular "prospect page" in each issue that
gives a"Libertarianism in One Page" sort of overview. That way, someone
who's reading the newsletter for the first time (maybe it's the first
piece of Libertarian literature they've ever seen) could tell what
we're all about from that page. Run this same page in every issue
(maybe reserve the next to that last page for it.) The top 1/2 would be
an abbreviated LP Program (or something like that) and the bottom 1/2
would be a Nolan survey and the membership/subscription coupon.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Suggestions from a Marketing Consultant</h3>

<p>Here are several excellent suggestions I received for <cite>Washington
Libertarian</cite> (the Washington LP newspaper) and <cite>Liberty
Today</cite> (the national outreach tabloid) from a marketing guru here
at Microsoft who is also a libertarian.  I think they apply to all LP
newsletters...</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Masthead for "Washington Libertarian" should, if not duplicate,
complement one of "Liberty Today."  Goal is to demonstrate that this is
an organized, national, coherent effort - that people won't be pissing
away their money on the Washington Lib Party which is somehow
independent of the national party (read:  50 separate, disparate,
unleveraged efforts).  Ideas:  Same Statue of Liberty icon - pick one
and go with it.  Both are kind of garish but the one on "Liberty Today"
is better - would be worth, but not required, looking at getting a
version of the Statue of Liberty icon which doesn't look so
impersonal/cold.  (Now it has that impersonal look that, say, the
Communist Party would like on their letterhead).</p></li>

<li><p>In masthead of <cite>Washington Libertarian</cite> you <em>must</em>
do as the <cite>Liberty Today</cite> did and put in the phone numbers, CIS
ID and call to action.</p></li>

<li><p><cite>Liberty Today</cite> is a meaningless name - the goal of this
organization is to effect political change, to do that it must recruit
members, the newsletter must do that and keep current members 'home'
(it is akin to a college alumni newsletter).  Change the name to
<cite>Libertarian Party News</cite> or something like that.  Get the party
name in there (if someone were walking by a recruitment table and just
scanning, what's the thing you want to spend your biggest font - the
thing you know they'll read - on....right, the party name.  Now you may
argue, "No, no one has heard of us, we want our message to scream out,
not our name."  I disagree - you're in a loop of a self-fulfilling
prophecy that way - you guarantee they'll never know the party name. 
You aren't selling the idea of freedom - you are selling a political
party and you want people to pay you with votes.  In the voting booth
there is no message next to your candidates' names - just party
affiliation.  I think the party is pretty well known, in any case, so
we can use this analogy:  The Democratic Party has its name above its
tables at events not their slogan "Economic Dark Ages NOW!" or whatever
it is they stand for (helping people, I guess they would say.)</p></li>

<li><p>An idea:  Use the national paper for recruiting new people and the
state paper for recruiting new people but primarily for informing
existing members.  This idea perhaps should be chucked if all major
states don't have their own newspapers.  I suggest this because I
assume the national party has the bucks and they can produce a better
looking product - let that product be your vehicle for getting out the
message - don't waste space redundantly by selling the message in both
newspapers.  Use the local paper to communicate what is happening
locally and what people can do locally - that makes sense because that
is where you want people involved - locally.  This will also nicely
dovetail this way:  "See, we are a national organization with shared
values and we have things you can do to support those values in your
own backyard."</p>

<li><p>In every issue have a column or section titled something like
"Welcome new Libertarians!"  You want the newsletter to focus on
topical events, but you need to realize it is partly a recruiting
device and that new people may be hesitant getting and staying involved
- make 'em feel welcome!  Explain the purpose of the newsletter, the
state party, what they can do, etc.  Perhaps change it every issue
(maybe focusing on what is happening for new people at that time or
where new people are needed at that time) so that existing people don't
get bored with it.</p></li>

<li><p>Text font is fine, headlines font is unprofessional.  Look at what
daily newspapers use and see if that might work.  Current font is a bit
too 'contemporary' and inappropriate for serious communication.</p></li>

<li><p>Letters to the editor.  This ain't a general daily trying to provide
a 'balanced' (yes, I'm rolling on the floor in laughter as I type) view
of the news.  That means, since you are using this for recruiting, that
the ugliest letters of dissent must not be printed.  However, healthy
debates are good because they show people this is a group of
intellectually open people (again, not <em>too</em> open - you don't want
people to think the organization is not well-run and that infighting paralyzes
it).  More letters would be good to demonstrate that and to show that
people are active in the rank-and-file and listened to by the party
'elders.'  Consider expanding this section.</p></li>

<li><p>International News Bites.  Why is this here?  Shouldn't the national
party be focusing on stuff like that?  I'm not dead set against this
section here, but I'd think you could find local things that people
will care more about to write about here (or national, even - most
people really don't give a rat's patootie about the six <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canadians</a> who
have a clue and are libertarian).</p></li>

<li><p>Advertisements.  If they are needed financially to stay afloat, then
fine - but they sure give the paper and party that "we're not really
professional politicians" look and feel.</p></li>

<li><p>Bits about rallies, meetings, etc. where the members can go to
voice their opinions are great.  All in all, I'd always emphasize
<em>activities</em> that the party is doing quite heavily, with calls to action
for how people can be involved (even if it is just giving money).</p></li>

<li><p>If the party is pretty big in the state and growing fast, a monthly
chart showing the size and growth rate would be nice - shows people
they are reaching critical mass to effect real change and not some
bizarre little splinter group.  Also helps with recruiting - everyone
loves to jump on a bandwagon.  (If there are really only 100 people in
the party, don't do it - it will drive people off by showing you aren't=
a force.  I'd say the threshold number is 10,000).</p></li>

<li><p>Calendar is excellent - expand and always include.</p></li>
<li><p>News Bites [similar to <a
href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html">Reason</a> magazine's "Brickbats"]
is cute and light - keep it.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the membership form.</p></li>
<li><p>All in all, I think the local paper is better than the <cite>Liberty
Today</cite>.  It conveys more relevant information, is more professional and
does a better job of protraying the party as serious and not some
bizarre, wacko group of anarchists.  Very nice job!</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Planning the Content</h3>

<p>Layout templates and spreadsheets</p>

<p>Some editors change the layout every issue, but when I was editor, I
used the same template for each issue so that I knew I always needed a
500-word article for the top of page 5, and a half-page ad for the
bottom of page 5, etc. It saved a lot of time, and I always knew what
length text to ask my authors for.</p>

<p>I also used a spreadsheet to lay-out current and future issues. The
first column looked like this:</p>

<p>Items Needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Page 1: full page cover story (750 words with photo, 1000 words
	without)</li>
<li>Page 1: 3 x 5 photo or artwork (optional)</li>
<li>Page 2: 1/4 page "From the Chair" column (250 words)</li>
<li>Page 2: 1/4 page "Projects" column (250 words)</li>
<li>Page 2: 1/2 page advertisement or article (500 words)</li>
<li>etc.
</ul>

<p>The second column listed the next issue ("FEBRUARY") and the third
column listed the subsequent issue and so on. In the appropriate cells,
I'd then list the name of the article or the author or the advertiser
(and when the ad was paid for). This way, I was able to reserve space
for multiple ads, regular features, etc. It saved me a lot of time and
bother because I could always tell what I still needed for the next
issue (and for several issues down the road.)</p>

<h3>Getting Articles</h3>

<p>Libernet is a great source of news items.  Also, you should contact
allied organizations (national, state, and local) and ask them to add
you to their press release list.  That way, you can cover their
projects as well (National Taxpayers Union, <a
href="/revolution/by_name/C/Cato.html">Cato</a>, Reason, etc.)</p>

<title>Nolan Booths</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Nolan booth procedures</h2>
<p>Last updated 8/5/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Lots of people requested more information on running successful Nolan 
booths on campus, so I decided to mail LIBERNET. I hope that this 
encourages all of you (students and non-students) to spend a nice 
afternoon at your local campus introducing students to libertarianism. 
In my 7 years of activism, I haven't found anything more <em>fun</em>, more 
rewarding, or more important!</p>

<h3>Purpose of Nolan Booths</h3>

<p>I've run many Nolan booths on campus and I encourage you to do the 
same. The following tips are the results of lots of mistakes and 
successes, so learn from my experiences! I think campus Nolan booths 
are the single most important activity a libertarian organization can 
undertake for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Discovering young libertarians for recruitment. Get 'em when they're 
young and they're yours forever!</li>
<li>Helping the student population find out what a libertarian is (and
isn't).</li>
<li>Providing a libertarian presence on campus.</li>
<li>It's a fun activity for libertarians to do. You find 'em, and then 
put 'em to work finding others!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Location and Timing</h3>

<p>Pick the best high-traffic (pedestrian, of course) area you can on 
campus. You probably don't need permission to set up a booth outside, 
but you may need permission to set up inside campus buildings. The best 
time to do this is early in the term before people get too busy and 
when they are still open to joining campus groups. If you can do these 
booths regularly (once a month?) that's awesome, if you can only do it 
a couple of times, focus on the beginning of the term.</p>

<h3>Materials Needed for Nolan Booths</h3>

<p>I recommend that you own these materials yourself. If it's owned in 
common, it gets lost or trashed. He who pays for it (or works for it) 
gets to own it. When you graduate, donate it to the next activist. If 
you are low on funds, hit up the local or state LP and explain the 
importance of campus outreach. If that fails, hit up the good folks on 
LIBERNET or at the national LP...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>At least one, at best three, volunteers for each 2-hour shift.
Friendly, outgoing people are the best! They don't need to be gifted 
orators because the point is to process surveys, not debate 
libertarianism. In fact, you should <em>not</em> debate or explain, it wastes 
time and creates a hostile atmosphere. Just refer people to the free 
literature. Be really friendly and pleasant. No arguing! If someone 
acts like a jerk, ignore them!</p></li>
<li><p>Clipboards with Nolan surveys. You'll go through about 25 an hour 
per clipboard.</p></li>
<li><p>A crate of prospect kits that your state LP normally sends to 
prospects. By handing them out to your new prospects, you can save the 
state LP a lot of postage costs. Expect to give out about 5 per manhour 
(see STATISTICS, below.) All of your printed materials (including the 
survey) should have your group's name and phone number.</p></li>
<li><p>A card table to hold free literature (don't forget
paperweights!)</p></li>
<li><p>A Nolan chart poster attached to foamcore or cardboard, laminated. 
(optional)</p></li>
<li><p>Sticky post-it dots for scoring people on the poster.
(optional)</p></li>
<li><p>An easel to hold the Nolan poster. (optional)</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>How to Run the Booth</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Ask passersby, "Do you have a minute for our political opinion
poll?"</p></li>
<li><p>Ask them the survey questions and circle their answers. Plot them on 
the sheet. By doing it for them, you speed up the process and passersby hear
what's going on.</p></li>
<li><p>Plot dots on the big poster, if you have one. This is a real 
attention getter, and soon people will be stopping at the booth waiting 
in line for the survey! No kidding!</p></li>
<li><p>When, you've scored the person, identify yourself as a member of the 
campus libertarian group and:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>give them their survey back and encourage them to try it on
	their friends later,</li>
	<li>if they score high libertarian (80/80 or higher) ask if they'd
	"like to receive more info on the LP."</li>
	<li>give them the official prospect kit (do this after you get their
	address.) Put a checkmark next to their name so you know that you don't
	spend money sending them the same kit.</li>
	</ol>
<li><p>Keep a sign-up sheet at the bottom of each clipboard and write down 
their name/address/phone/year. Since you write it down <em>legibly</em>, you're 
able to read it, and it goes quickly. Getting names is the single most 
important reason you're doing this! These people will be your future 
members and activists... Make sure to get phone numbers!</p></li>
<li><p>When you're done for the day, go grab a pizza with your volunteers 
to celebrate and talk about what worked and what can be improved. (This 
builds esprit de corps that's crucial to any group.)</p></li>
<li><p>Send these names to your state LP membership director ASAP so they 
can be put on the mailing list. If you've already given these people 
prospect kits, make sure the membership director understands this! 
You'll save them a lot of money!</p></li>
<li><p>EXTRA CREDIT: Submit one of these surveys to the campus newspaper 
along with a press release showing the statistics over a couple of 
months. This would be an interesting news item, wouldn't it? That's an 
easy way to get publicity for your campus group, libertarianism, and 
the booth itself. If you want to get fancy, break down the info by year 
or by sex or by major, etc.</p></li>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>Call the folks on the sign-up sheet about a week later and ask what 
they think about libertarianism, if they're interested in staying on 
the mailing list, and if they'd like to help with the next Nolan booth. 
By getting them involved, even before they're 100% sure, you speed them 
along the educational curve. This is more than enough for any campus 
group to do, but if you're ambitious, you can bring speakers to campus, 
hold discussion groups, etc.</p>

<h3>Statistics</h3>

<p>In my experience, you can expect to process about 25 surveys each 
man-hour (one person working one hour.) About 20% of all your 
participants will score high libertarian (80/80 or higher) and sign 
your mailing list. That means you will distribute about 5 prospect kits 
each man-hour (e.g., so two people doing a four hour shift should bring 
at least 40 prospect kits.)</p>

<h3>More Info?</h3>

<p>If you'd like to get copies of the Nolan booth literature we're using 
(survey and other handouts), send me a 55-cent stamp and I'll rush a 
kit to you. Then, if you like, I can make customized masters for you 
(with your student group address and info) all for the same low price 
(just the postage.) Also, let me know if you have any further questions 
on technique or strategy.</p>

<title>Organizers</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Organizers -- Recruiting & Training Them</h2>
<p>Last updated 5/29/95 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>The LP needs lots of local organizers to find new prospects and members 
using <a href="booths.html">Nolan booths</a>, seminars, etc.</p>

<p>It should be the goal of every state LP to have active organizers in 
each county (or at least each major city) in the state.  And someone on 
your executive committee (the state chair, the membership chair, etc.) 
should be responsible for personally recruiting these organizers.  (If 
you're not on the executive committee yourself, but would like to be an 
organizer or help recruit organizers, offer them your services!)

<p>It is crucial that instead of just designating some stranger to be the 
organizer for a particular county or city that you meet him or her in 
person and make sure that the person is qualified.  Nothing is worse 
than having an organizer who turns people off.  It is better to not 
have an organizer at all than to have a poor one.  (After all, that 
person represents the LP and might be scaring off potential members, 
volunteers and donors.)  You want someone who has his/her act 
together, is friendly and outgoing, is not a kook, and shows common 
sense.  (They will learn the skills later.)  To make these important 
judgements, you need to meet prospective organizers in person and watch 
them in action.  An ideal way to do this is to get them together to do 
a Nolan booth in their area.  (Or if not you, then someone you trust in 
a nearby area, such as the organizer in the next county.)</p>

<p>To recruit your prospective organizers, get a list of volunteers for 
each particular area.  Find those who have volunteered to be organizers 
or help with Nolan booths or be candidates, etc.  Call them up and ask 
them to help do a Nolan booth and figure out ideal dates and locations. </p>

<p>Remember, you are organizing this one, so it's up to you to ultimately 
decide the details. Hopefully, you'll be able to involve as many 
volunteers (ones you think might be good organizers) as possible.  
You'll be training them and doing the Nolan booth with them, so you'll 
get to see them in action.  When the day is done, make notes on the 
volunteers and determine if you have found any potential organizers.</P>

<p>If not, repeat this process with a new batch of volunteers in that 
county or city.  If you think you have found some organizers, give them 
a call soon after to thank them again for their help and to ask if 
they'd like to continue doing Nolan booths.  If so, ask if they'd like 
to organize the next one (you will be their mentor.)  Basically, this 
is the way to get organizers started.  In fact, the most important 
thing local organizers can do is organize Nolan booths (and send the 
list of prospects they've found to the state office.)  Anything else is 
icing on the cake (but the cake comes first!)</p>

<p>Once they've run their first Nolan booth, ask them to become the 
official LP organizer in their area.  Explain to them that their main 
task would be organizing Nolan booths and that the state LP will get 
them the names of volunteers, etc.  Offer to sell them (at cost) the 
Nolan booth kit (card table, easel, and poster) so that they have one 
of their very own (this also helps determine their committment.)  Call 
this organizer every few months to encourage and offer help.  Send 
monthly updates of volunteers in their area.  If the person turns out 
to be a good organizer, encourage them to move onto the next level 
(creating an official regional LP.)  If the person turns out to be a 
dud (give them at least 6 months, but no more than a year) find a new 
organizer!</p>

<title>High School Outreach</title>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Outreach to High Schools</h2>
<p>Last updated 9/5/95 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>I have spoken to almost a dozen high school and college classes and I 
find it one of the most personally rewarding activities.  It's also 
very important to reach students (and teachers) with our message.  It 
legitimizes the LP when they get invited to speak to your class.  And 
when they see what a good job you do (whether they agree with you or 
not) it gives a good image of the LP.</p>

<p>Our primary goal is to expose these kids to Libertarian ideas and to 
give them enough information so they can progress on their own (by 
giving them a solid info packet.)</p>

<p>The following ideas assume that you want to organize a speaker's bureau 
in your area (check with your county LP first to make sure there isn't 
one already.)  However,  you'll find plenty of ideas to use even if 
intend to go solo.</p>

<h3>Identify Good Speakers</h3>

<p>Interest in having political speakers is usually highest in October 
(because of the elections in early November) but I've been invited to 
speak throughout the school year.  At any rate, get into the routine at 
the beginning every school year of identifying the volunteers who would 
be good speakers.  They don't need to be awesome orators, they just 
need to be nice, friendly people who don't come across as raving kooks. </p>

<p>They need to be comfortable with public speaking, obviously, but they 
also need to dress respectably (i.e., business suit.)  You want to look 
like you're ready to assume public office.  If you don't take yourself 
seriously, they won't take you seriously either.  People who have (or 
want to) run for office should practice their public speaking by 
talking to high school classes.</p>

<h3>Solicit Speaking Engagements</h3>

<p>Once you've identified your stable of speakers, assign each one of them 
a local school district.  Have them draw up a list of all the high 
schools in their district (don't forget private schools).  Focus on 
high schools in upper-class neighborhoods (the kids are better 
educated, college-bound, and, who knows, you might get their rich 
parents interested, too!)  Get the address and phone number for each 
school.  Then, call up each of the schools and ask for the names of all 
the Civics/Social Studies/Politics/Government (or whatever they call it
in your area) teachers that teach Seniors.  (Juniors are ok, too, but 
don't waste your time with younger kids.)  Make sure you get the 
spelling of their names right and get their personal phone numbers as well.</p>

<p>The coordinator then creates a database with all of this information 
and sends a form letter to all of the teachers.  The letter might read 
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Ms. Jackson,</p>

<p>The Libertarian Party often gets requests to send a representative to 
speak to local high school classes.  Many teachers would like their 
students to be exposed to alternative political parties, and we are 
happy to oblige with classroom presentations on the third largest party 
in the country (and its history, positions, and unique role in American 
politics.)   We have already done well-received presentations at 
Churchill, Gateway, and Penn Hills High Schools.</p>

<p>I am writing to let you know that we are again booking speakers in 
your area.  Please contact me as soon as possible to ensure that 
speakers are available when you need them.</p>

<p>We are also happy to provide schools with reference materials on the 
Libertarian Party, including books and videotapes, and to provide 
participants for debates, political fairs, or materials for class projects.</p>

<p>I have enclosed materials to acquaint you with the Libertarian Party 
and its views.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Tom Isenberg, 206-936-7359</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Send your standard prospect kit to the teacher (it should include the 
National LP Program and the Nolan Chart survey.)  To see the awesome 
prospect kit that we use, send two 29-cent stamps to: LPWS, P.O. Box 
20732, Seattle, WA 98102.</p>

<p>Two weeks after these letters have gone out, have your speakers do a 
follow-up call to the teachers in their assigned schools.  The call 
might go as follows:  "Hello, this is Tom Isenberg.  I'm with the 
Libertarian Party of King County and I wanted to make sure you received 
the information we sent you on our speakers program.  Would you like a
representative of the Libertarian Party to make a presentation to your 
class?  Etc."</p>

<p>Arrange for a mutually satisfactory time, get 
directions, find out how many students you will be speaking to, and 
call back to confirm the day before the speech.  Try not to schedule 
more than two classes on a given day, you'll be exhausted.  If 
possible, schedule for early morning classes (teenagers get sleepy 
after lunch.)</p>

<h3>Prepare Handouts</h3>

<p>Image is everything in politics.  That's why you have to look and act 
first-class.  Also, your literature has to look sharp.  We want to make 
sure that students have something to take home and show their family 
and friends, put up on their bedroom wall, and maybe even act on later. </p>

<p> So bring enough copies of the Nolan Chart survey (with your membership 
form, reading list, etc. on the back) and the "Bill of Rights: Void 
Where Prohibited by Law" handbill for each student (if you want to get 
a copy of either, contact me.)  Have your assistant hand them out 
before class begins.</p>

<p>Also, you'll want to bring some prospect kits for students who want 
them (about 30% of the class.)  Start with your standard prospect kit
and add a free issue of Reason magazine, the Cato books catalog, the 
Freeman, and the Laissez-Faire Books catalog.  (These organizations 
have provided free supplies for distribution, so ask them.)  For more 
information on professional-looking prospect kits, contact me.  Also, 
include photocopies of contests/scholarship/seminar info for college 
libertarians (you know, the full page ads you see in Reason.)  Many 
kids are college-bound and may be interested in such things.</p>

<p>Make sure you give a copy of this prospect kit for the teacher, in 
addition to a copy of Robert Ringer's <cite>Restoring the American Dream</cite>
or other introductory book for his classroom library.</p>

<h3>Give the Presentation</h3>

<p>To get a copy of the <a href="speech.html">standard high school speech</a>
 I give, contact me.</p>

<p>Always bring an assistant with you.  Bring someone who would like to 
give speeches, so they can see what it's like (to see that it's not so 
hard.)  You'll want them to dress as professionally as you do, because 
you're both representing the Libertarian Party, a serious political 
party.  Have your assistant distribute handouts and take notes (ideas 
for improvements, questions that were asked, etc.)  You'll use these
notes to improve next time.</p>

<p>Dress for success.  Wear a suit.  Look like you're in office already.  
If you look like a schmoe, go give a speech on behalf of the Socialist 
Workers Party instead, you'll help our cause more.</p>

<p>Hang out with the teacher before and after class.  Make conversation.  
Let him get to know you as a
decent normal person (not a fanatic kook).  Don't debate politics with 
him, make friends with him.  You want him to invite Libertarians back, 
year after year.</p>

<h3>Solicit the Junior Statesmen Foundation</h3>

<p>Finally, check with your state and county LP to see if you should make 
yourself available as an LP representative to the Junior Statesmen 
Foundation chapter in your area: call 1-800-334-5353, in Northern CA, 
call 415-347-1600.  Or write to: The Junior State of America, 60 E. 
Third Ave #320, San Mateo, CA 94401-4032.  This nationwide organization 
is geared towards high school students who are interested in politics.  
They hold annual conventions complete with debates, keynote speakers, 
seminars, and political fairs.  The 1994 Junior State of America
regional conventions were held in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/Spokane.html">Spokane</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Austin.html">Austin</a>,
Anaheim, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York</a>,
Seattle,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/LosAngeles.html">Los
Angeles</a>, and Santa Clara.</p>

<p>In
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a> state,
they always invite the Libertarians to set up a 
literature table.  We do the <a href="booths.html">Nolan booth</A> there,
and it's always the hit 
of the political fair.  If you can address the entire convention (by 
giving a speech or participating in a debate) that'd be awesome.  Push 
for that.  But at least participate in the political fair.  Obviously, 
you want to encourage libertarian students in your area to attend this 
and give presentations.</p>

<title>Primaries vs. Conventions</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Primaries vs. conventions</h2>
<p>Last updated 9/11/95 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<h3>Primaries -- <em>bad</em> idea</h3>

<p>In 1992 and 1994 in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>, the LP had
the right to have primaries.
In Texas, if the LP chooses to have a primary, that applies to the whole
state.  It is not permitted to have primaries in some counties and
conventions in other counties.  Only about 10 to 15 counties in Texas even
have an active county party that has had a convention.</p>

<p>Even the best organized counties in Texas do not have the quantity of
activists necessary to hold a primary.  Honey Lanham and I did the research
on the possiblity of having a primary in Dallas County.</p>

<p>There are several hundred polling places in Dallas County.  You need three
people per polling place.  They cannot be a candidate in that precinct.</p>

<p>The LP could, with permission of the FEC and the U.S. Dept. of Justice and
the Secretary of State of Texas, combine precincts and reduce the number of
polling places.  According to Bruce Sherbert, Dallas County Election
Administrator, those agencies would <em>never</em> approve fewer than 16 polling
places for a county the size and population of Dallas.  3 x 16 = 48 workers
minimum.  They must not be candidates.</p>

<p>There was a book 2 inches thick full of rules and regulations to be
studied.  There were all kinds of enormous paperwork burdens.  There was
enough work to keep one person busy at least 4 hours a day for several weeks
... maybe months before the primary -- just in Dallas County.  If Dallas and
Tarrant and Harris and a few other counties had primaries, the 200 other
counties in Texas would have <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>The filing fees for the 1992 LP Texas candidates would have been $80,000
to $100,000.  Most of our offices were uncontested at the convention.  Why
have a primary if only one libertarian applied for the job?  Would you run
for County Commisioner if you had to pay $500 to do so?</p>

<h3>History of Primaries in Texas</h3>

<p>In 1900, there was virtually no Republican Party in Texas.  As the
Republicans began to gain in strength, the Democrats who ran the Texas
Legislature passed a law requiring political parties to have primaries if
that party's candidate for governor got more than 20% of vote.  Between 2%
and 20%, a primary was optional.  For 20 years, the Republicans had the
option to have a primary and they chose to <em>not</em> have one. Then, one
year, they got 19% of the vote for governor and they had one anyway.  In that
year, the Republican candidate for governor got only 15% of the vote.
Having a primary <em>hurt</em> the Republican Party.</p>

<p>The Republicans <em>never</em> had another primary unless they
<em>had</em> to.</p>

<p>The history was obvious - The Republicans gradually gained strength until
they <em>had</em> to have a primary.  Then, when they held the primary they
did worse than the had done in the previous election <em>without</em> a
primary.</p>

<p>The explanation is very clear.  Running a primary is an enormously
expensive burden on a party because of the paperwork and bureaucracy.  It
is an enormously expensive burden on its candidates because of filing fees.</p>

<p>Each time the Republican Party had a primary, its candidates did
<em>worse</em> than
they did in the preceeding election when there was no primary to drain the
party of resources.</p>

<p>This happened repeatedly for 20 to 30 years.  Got more than 20% and they
were <em>forced</em> to have a primary.  The primary drained their resources and
they got less than 20% and chose to <em>not</em> have a primary.  Regained some
resources and got more than 20% again and were <em>forced</em> to have a primary
again.  Lost momentum again.  They did not consistently stay above 20%
until the 1940s.  From the <em>first</em> time they got more than 20%, it was 20
to 30 years before they <em>always</em> got more than 20% for governor.</p>

<p>The Democrats <em>forced</em> the Republicans to have a primary to weaken
it.</p>

<p>In Texas, each party pays for its own primary and the state of Texas
reimburses the party for most of its expenses.  In 1992, the Republicans
and Democrats received $12 Million <em>each</em> from the state of Texas
as <em>partial</em> reimbursement for holding a primary.</p>

<p>If the LP had a primary in 10 counties (leaving the other 200 with nothing),
the LP would probably have to spend over $4 Million and then apply to the
state of Texas for reimbursement.  The Democrats and Republicans have to
authorize a special bill authorizing this reimbursement.  What happens if
they claim we did not fill out the forms correctly.  They might delay payment
and we go broke.</p>

<p>Where is the LP Texas going to get $4 Million?</p>

<p>A primary is an expensive burden on the taxpayers of Texas.</p>


<p>These are the facts for Texas:</p>

<ol>
<li>Primary costs LP Texas over 4 Million dollars.</li>

<li>LP applies to Texas for reimbursement of most of that money.</li>

<li>Primary costs LP candidates $80,000 to $100,000 in filing fees.</li>

<li>Primaries can only be held in largest counties because only they have
   a county organization.  All other counties are ignored.</li>

<li>Each county needs full time person to fill out forms and talk to
   bureaucrats for several weeks/months before primary.</li>

<li>On primary day, each large county like Dallas, needs at <em>least</em> 48
poll workers all day long (14 hours).</li>

<li>LP candidates cannot be poll workers in their own district.</li>

<li>LP activists have no money and little energy left after the costly
primary to campaign and they will get fewer votes in the general election.</li>

<li>Primaries were created by large parties to weaken small parties and
subsidize large parties.  The taxpayer pays in both cases.</li>
</ol>

<title>Selling the LP</title>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Selling the LP</h2>
<p>Last updated 7/16/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here are some answers I give to friends who raise common objections to 
the LP of the "I like you guys, but..." variety.  This is written for 
Republicans, but can be easily modified for Democrats.</p>

<p>I have started keeping a file of "debate" answers so I don't have to 
spend time rewriting them. I just cut and paste and modify. It only 
took me 7 years to figure this out, too! &lt;g&gt;</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  There are some areas of the Libertarian platform that bother me.</p>

<p>A. Nobody agrees with any given platform 100%, but maybe the LP is 
closer to your principles than the Rs or Ds are. I figure that as long 
as the LP train is going in the right direction (reducing the 
size/power/cost of government) I'll ride as far as I can with them on 
those issues that I agree with. At some point, we all get off at 
different stops.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q. Isn't voting Libertarian just throwing your vote away?</p>

<p>A. Well, I think we're throwing our votes away if we don't vote for 
Libertarians. We're only encouraging the other statist parties. We're 
giving them our sanction by voting for them.  A vote for Libertarians, 
on the other hand, sticks out like a sore thumb. No one knows why 
someone votes Republican (because their parents are Republicans?) A 
Libertarian vote says, "Wake up, Republicans. I mean it when we say we 
want free markets and individual liberty."  Besides, Libertarians <em>are</em>
winning at the state and local level. There are four state legislators 
now (and about 120 other office-holders nationwide.) This is more than 
any other minor party. And LP numbers are increasing every year.</p>

<p>Perhaps you were thinking of the presidential race? Of course the LP 
candidate won't win in the foreseeable future, but that's not the 
point. The point of entering the presidential race is to get out there 
and spread the message with a high-level campaign. And we get 
exponentially more coverage each time.</p>

<p>The LP's purpose is two-fold. One is obviously to get people elected, 
and we're having more success every year. I hope that we will reach 
"critical mass" at some point and start a snowball effect, probably 
when we elect our first U.S. Congressman. Until then, the more people 
vote Libertarian, the more the Rs and Ds will have to move in a 
libertarian direction to re-capture those votes. This has already 
happened in the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a> U.S. Senate
race where the Republican candidate 
(Paul Coverdell) promised to enter some Libertarian bills if the 
Georgia LP promised to withdraw their "spoiler" candidate and endorse 
him instead. As you may know, this strategy worked well for Norman 
Thomas' Socialist Party in the '30s and '40s. They never got anyone 
elected to anything besides mayor of Milwaukee, but they quit running 
candidates in 1956 because the Rs and Ds had adopted all of their 
platform planks!</p>

<p>Perhaps the LP can have the same effect in the 
opposite direction. Obviously, we try to pick our battles wisely.  It 
makes no sense to run a Libertarian against a pretty good Republican.  
Libertarians run against crappy moderate Republicans, where the 
Democrat is no worse. Believe me, there are more of these races than 
the former.  We don't want to waste our votes, either, and we support 
good Republicans wherever possible. But where they stink, we'll be 
there as spoiler candidates (at the least) or run hard campaigns to win 
(at the best.)  Either way, the Republican Party learns a lesson and 
puts up better, more "libertarian" candidates next time around. For 
many years, Libertarians have generated some of the best ideas to be 
adopted by the Republicans: privatization, term limits, school choice, 
legalized gold ownership, etc.</p>

<p>The other purpose is to serve as an educational "clearinghouse." LP 
members (candidates, students, etc.) spread the libertarian message via 
advertisements, campus lectures, talk shows, interviews, op-ed columns
or in discussion with friends. Interested people then call up the LP 
and get an info kit that presents them with a complete, consistent, 
principled vision and moral defense of limited government (often for 
the first time in their lives.) They also learn about the wide range of 
libertarian/conservative organizations, thinktanks, magazines, books, 
etc. Whether they end up becoming LP members or not doesn't really 
matter (it's nice, especially if they send $$$ to help out with these 
activities.) But we're happy if they become better Republicans (or even 
better Democrats) and help move their parties in a more libertarian 
direction on those issues that they agree with the LP on, e.g., make 
the Republicans deliver on their free-market rhetoric and make the 
Democrats deliver on their individual liberties rhetoric. Did you know 
that Rep. Dana Rohrbacher (R-CA) was once the chair of the California 
LP? Several other Republicans (particularly at the state legislature 
level) were also LP stalwarts before they decided to run as Republicans.</p>

<p>Bottom line: join the LP.  If you think their train is going in the 
right direction (free markets and limited government), ride it as far 
as you can.  At least they're going in the right direction.  The 
Democrats and Republicans are both heading in the wrong direction 
(socialism and Big Brother), just at different speeds. If you're really 
in favor of free markets, individual liberty & <em>responsibility</em>, and 
limited constitutional government (all of which must mean that you're 
disgusted with the Republicans) call the Libertarian Party for a free 
information kit: 1-800-353-1776.</p>

<h2>Speech: What is the LP?</h2>
<p>Last updated 4/24/95 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here are the notes for my standard speech to <a
href="highschools.html">high school classes</a> and
introductory seminars. The presentation takes about 30 minutes (not
including the Q&A portion, of course.) Maybe you can use it in your
presentations.</p>

<p>I gave this speech yesterday to a local H.S. class and it was very
well-received. The teacher especially liked it (she scored Libertarian,
herself.) So call up your local H.S., ask for the names of civics
teachers, and write them a letter announcing your availability to do a
presentation on the LP.</p>

<p>This speech has evolved over the years, and I'm still trying to improve
it. Send your suggestions directly to <a
href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Bring:</h3>

<ul>
<li>overhead foils: Nolan quiz and chart</li>
<li>handouts: Nolan quizzes, Bill of Rights: Void Where Prohibited By Law</li>
<li>prospect kits for teacher and kids who want more info (include cool
things like <a href="bumperstickers.html">bumperstickers</a>)</li>
<li><cite>Restoring the American Dream</cite> and <cite>Capitalism: The
Unknown Ideal</cite> as
gifts for the teacher's classroom library (also a recent sample issue
of <cite>Reason</cite> and <cite>The Freeman</cite>.)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>The Speech</h3>

<h3>Introduce Myself</h3>

<p>Name, where I work, how long I've been involved with the LP, etc.
Write your name, address, and phone on the index card if you want to be
on the mailing list.</p>

<p>This talk is a quick 30 minute overview, so let's hold Q&A until the end.
I have info packets if you want more info. Pick one up on your way out
after class.</p>

<h3>What is the LP?</h3>

<p>3rd largest US party, 100s in office (state legislators and mayors),
organized in all 50 states;
LP is only a small part of the movement: thinktanks, professors, 
magazines, conferences, etc.;
(Info packet available at the end.)</p>

<h3>What is Libertarianism?</h3>

<p>Probably the same as your personal philosophy: live and let live.
Thou shalt not aggress;
Aggression = theft, violence, fraud, trespass, pollution, breaking
contracts, etc;
Derivation: Self-ownership => property rights => all human rights
=> Free markets, civil liberties, non-intervention in foreign affairs;
This is the philosophy of Founding Fathers and Declaration of Independence;
LP puts these philosophical principles first when taking positions.
Rs and Ds put politics ahead of what's right. But does might make
right? Does majority make right?</p>

<h3>Is the LP Liberal or Conservative or What?</h3>

<p>Was Thomas Jefferson right-wing or left-wing?
Libs combine the best of liberalism and the best of conservatism for a
consistent pro-individual rights platform.
Bogosity of one-dimensional left-right "map": where do you put friend
who things both guns and drugs should be legal? Where do you put a
friend who thinks both guns and drugs should be illegal?</p>

<p>Explain the Nolan chart.
Have everyone take the Nolan quiz.
Go through each question and explain it. Explain how a Libertarian
would answer it.
Show students how to score themselves and ask for show of hands for
each quadrant.
Encourage students to survey their friends & parents later to see if
they're Nazis or what...</p>

<h3>Why the LP?</h3>

<p>No one agrees with any party 100%, but maybe we're closest to what you
believe. Don't waste your vote. Vote libertarian to send a clear message that
people will understand.
Minor parties don't need to win to have a profound impact (e.g., U.S.
Socialists in 1930s.)
Rhetoric aside, Rs and Ds are pretty much the same: big government
power brokers.
Their philosophy is get elected and stay elected, whatever it takes.
Republicans aren't really pro-free-markets (give examples)
Democrats aren't really pro-civil-liberties (give examples)</p>

<h3>Questions and Answers</h3>

<p>First off, if I don't get to <em>your</em> question, these info packets will
probably have the answer so make sure you pick one up on your way out
of you're interested in the LP.
(If no one has a question, start them off with one. For example, say
"Often I get the question, doesn't laissez-faire capitalism result in
oppression?" Pick a tough one and answer it well.)</p>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Spokespersons</h2>
<p>Last updated 7/1/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Here is some Q&A about appointing a spokesperson for your LP group.</p>

<blockquote>
We here are looking at setting up a media committee, especially now that
we got us some candidates.  The idea is to get a group of 3 people (5 max)
who can practice working out replies to media when they call for interviews,
and prep candidates to do likewise.
</blockquote>

<p>Excellent idea! At the very least, all candidates and party officers 
should get this training. Here in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a>,
we do it as part of our annual 
Campaign Management School in May. (We promote this in one of our 
quarterly fundraiser mailings to all our members, encouraging them to 
be candidates or campaign workers or campaign donors for the coming 
elections.) Let me recommend that you order some of David Bergland's 
"Bite Size Answers" tapes from
<a href="/revolution/by_name/A/ASG.html">Advocates for Self Government</a>
(about $10 
and I believe you can make and distribute free copies.) They are 
perfect for this sort of training; I think every Libertarian should own 
one! Call them at 1-800-932-1776 for a complete catalog.</p>

<blockquote>
My question for you:  what is your protocol when the media call?  Do you
assign a spokesperson?
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, we assign a spokesperson.  I am usually that person, due to my 
experience and ability and comfort-level.  I am also the "receptionist" 
who checks our statewide 1-800 voicemail system several times a day, 
so I'm able to meet these needs as soon as they arise.  It's a good 
idea to train your receptionist as well or to at least make sure they 
have an updated list of authorized spokespersons who are available 
during the day and also at night.</p>

<blockquote>
Do you try to get your top-billing candidate to do
the interview (ours has radio experience, which was our main reason for
picking him)?
</blockquote>

<p>That depends. Sometimes reporters ask for the Chair or for a candidate. 
But if either of these are poor speakers, I steer them to our 
"authorized" speakers.</p>

<blockquote>
Do reporters generally give out their questions ahead of time,
or was it amateurish of me to ask?
</blockquote>

<p>It was amateurish of you to ask, but understandable! You should keep a 
list of questions that reporters typically ask so that you can train 
people to answer them.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<title>Supper Clubs</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Supper Clubs</h2>
<p>Last updated 5/17/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>Someone recently posted the criticism that LP meetings have speakers 
who "preach to the converted" as opposed to " talk about effective 
communications, history, etc."  As someone who helps run the Patrick 
Henry Lecture Series here in the Seattle area ("supper club" sounds too 
dowdy to me), I have some ideas on this.</p>

<p>I have nothing against "preaching to the converted" as long as the 
converted are eager to pay the entrance fee and are encouraged to bring 
newcomers as well. This definitely has its place. But variety is the 
spice of life, so we try something different every time.</p>

<p>We ask a $2 donation at the door and we keep track of attendance, so we 
have a sense of what the "market" wants. Our best attended lectures (we 
average 20) have been given by people who are fighting the government 
in high-profile cases (e.g., Dr. Jonathan Wright vs FDA). Also, 
representatives of well-known organizations draw a lot of people. (We 
also try to invite politicians who support our position on a particular 
bill. This is more for them to get to know us than vice versa.)</p>

<p>For activist-oriented topics (e.g., effective communications, 
campaigning, etc.) we hold separate LP workshops, since these topics 
have limited interest.</p>

<p>If people in my area have ideas for topics or speakers, they get in 
touch, and I'm glad they do. So, if you want to improve your local 
supper club, let the organizer know what you want.</p>

<p>Another problem we occasionally face is, how shall I put it, weirdos. 
People who are either kooks or druggies or very unpleasant.  I've been 
to supper clubs that I would feel embarrassed to bring newcomers 
(because of the weirdos.) Frankly, I give weirdos the cold shoulder, 
because they scare off the normal people who contribute time and money. 
If he's really obnoxious, I'll ask him to "find another group that 
would suit your style more." If he's really detrimental, I'll ask him 
to "help our cause by joining the Young Democrats instead." (Hey, it
works.)</p>

<p>By the way, I always dress in suit and jacket at these events, and I go 
out of my way to make newcomers feel welcome. I strongly encourage 
others to do the same. It's really improved our image to both guests 
and speakers, and it's also improved our morale and attendance. A big 
part of that was moving to a nicer restaurant with a private banquet room.</p>

<title>Prospect Survey</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Survey your prospects</h2>
<p>Last updated by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>The Washington State LP surveys our prospects.  When we send database 
updates to our county LP's database managers, we also include printed 
surveys for all new prospects.  Each county LP is responsible for 
surveying those prospects and sending the completed surveys back to the 
state office.</p>

<p>The ideas is that two weeks after we send out a prospect kit, we call 
the prospect. We ask him/her a few questions and put these responses in 
a survey database (so we can do some analysis later.)</p>

<p>Our goals are to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give <em>every</em> prospect some human contact, to "humanize" our 
political party and show them we care.</li>
<li>Discover what makes prospects contact us.</li>
<li>Discover how easy it is for prospects to contact us.</li>
<li>Discover what issues turn people on.</li>
<li>Get their impressions of the LP and answer their questions (<em>not</em>
try to convert them)</li>
<li>Encourage prospects to take the next step (become members, 
volunteers, donors)</li>
<li>Weed out prospects who aren't interested after all. Why keep them on 
the mailing list?</li>
<li>Find out what kind of talents and experience they have (occupation, 
organizations.)</li>
<li>Find out what their donor potential is (occupation, organizations.)</li>
<li>Give our volunteers something to do!</li>
<li>Find out who are volunteers are and what tasks they want to help with.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Survey</h3>

<p>NOTE: Have a cheerful, positive disposition and be extremely polite and 
respectful. Remember, they will get their first (and lasting) 
impression of the Libertarian Party from you! Be very diplomatic. 
Sometimes people will chew your ear off with their own theories and 
gripes. Don't waste time debating with them! Just stick to the 
following questions (in order.) Have a pen ready to mark their answers.</p>

<p>Hello, this is (insert your name) calling for (insert their name). I'm
a volunteer with the Libertarian Party of Washington State. I'm just getting
in touch with people on our mailing list to get your opinion on a few
questions.</p>

<p>Is this a good time to talk?
(IF NO: When should I call back: ___________.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Great! My first question is: Was it easy for you to find the phone 
number of the Libertarian Party when you first contacted us?
	<ol>
	<li>phone book/directory assistance</li>
	<li>Washington Libertarian newsletter</li>
	<li>other literature (specify):</li>
	<li>at an event (specify):</li>
	<li>advertisement (specify):</li>
	<li>other (specify):</li>
	<li>I didn't call.</li>
	</ol>
<li><p>Where did you first hear about the Libertarian Party?
	<ol>
	<li>news story (specify):</li>
	<li>friend</li>
	<li>other literature (specify):</li>
	<li>at an event (specify):</li>
	<li>advertisement (specify):</li>
	<li>other (specify):</li>
	</ol>
<li><p>What made you decide to contact the Libertarian Party?</li>
<li><p>Did you have a chance to look over the materials we sent you?</li>
<li><p>Would you like to become a member of the Libertarian Party? It's 
free and it does not affect your voter registration at all.

<p>IF NO: Would you like us to take you off of our mailing list?
IF YES: We'll do that. Thank you very much for your time! Goodbye!</p>

<p>IF YES: Great! Do you still have the membership card we sent you?
IF YES: Great! Just send put it in the mail as soon as you can!
IF NO: We'll send a new membership card to you at: (insert address)</p>

<li><p>Would you like to volunteer with the Libertarian Party in your area?
IF NO: (Go to question 13.)</li>

<li><p>Have you had any political experience before?</li>

<li><p>What are your interests or talents, for example, what's your
occupation?
	<ol>
	<li>student</li>
	<li>retired</li>
	<li>full-time parent</li>
	<li>attorney</li>
	<li>accountant</li>
	<li>secretary</li>
	<li>advertising</li>
	<li>marketing</li>
	<li>other (specify):</li>
	</ol>
<li><p>OK, I have a list of possible volunteer activities and you just say 
YES or NO if you'd be interested in them. You don't need any 
experience, because we'll train you if you're really interested, so 
just say YES or NO to each of the following choices. Would you like to:
	<ol>
     	<li>attend Libertarian lectures or conferences?</li>
     	<li>work on a campaign?</li>
     	<li>write letters to the editor?</li>
     	<li>call talk shows?</li>
     	<li>collect signatures for initiatives or candidates?</li>
     	<li>help staff a literature table at the local mall?</li>
    	<li>lobby lawmakers or testify at public hearings?</li>
     	<li>speak to <a href="highschools.html">high-school classes</a>
     		or other groups?</li>
     	<li>help organize college groups?</li>
     	<li>help with convention planning?</li>
     	<li>help do telephone surveys like this one?</li>
     	<li>be an officer in the local or state party?</li>
     	<li>be a discussion group participant or leader?</li>
     	<li>put a Libertarian <a href="bumperstickers.html">bumpersticker</a>
     		on your car? (we'll send you one)</li>
     	<li>help with envelope stuffing?</li>
     	<li>write for our <a href="newsletters.html">newsletter</a> (opinion
     		pieces, articles, etc.)?</li>
     	<li>host a get-together to show a Libertarian video to neighbors 
	and friends?</li>
     	<li>participate in daytime rallies and protests?</li>
     	<li>participate in nightime rallies and protests?</li>
     	<li>run for office?</li>
	</ol>
<p>(NOTE: You'll want to use these same letter or number codes in the
"volunteer?" field of your database.)</p>

<li><p>Are you active in any other political organizations? What do you do
there?</li>

<li><p>Are you involved in any other social organizations? What do you do
there?</li>

<li><p>Would you like to make a small financial contribution at 
this time, say $10?</p>

<p>IF YES: We can do it by credit card over the phone, if you like:
(Visa or MC, name on card:, card number:, expiration date:</p>

<p>IF NO: OK, maybe you can help us out later...</p></li>

<li><p>Do you feel closer to conservatives or liberals or neither?</p></li>
<li><p>What political issues are you most interested in?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any questions you have for us at this time?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you very much for your time and maybe I'll get to meet you in 
person at some Libertarian events!</p>

<title>Campaign Training</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1990's -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Campaigning</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a>:</p>

<p>I attended the three-day Campaign Management Seminar at the LP convention in
Salt Lake City and it really opened my eyes and got me motivated. Everyone who
attended raved about it. (And several of us have attended Republican Party
campaign workshops.)</p>

<p>The professional campaign consultant who led the workshop, Sal Guzzetta, 
debunked several misconceptions we Libertarians often have about campaigning.
According to him:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Name recognition is the key to victory. 85% of the voters in non-federal
elections cite this as their main motivation for voting. The rest, only 15%,
care strongly about party affiliation and/or the candidate's actual positions.
The good news, obviously, for Libertarians is that our label and positions are
not liabilities for the vast majority of voters. The bad news is, many
Libertarian  candidates would rather debate their controversial positions
instead of doing the real work of ringing doorbells and handing out name
cards.</p></li>

<li><p>You only need 51% of the voters to win. And then you can educate the 
public as much as you want when the reporters interview you as a lawmaker.
Therefore you must do telephone polls to find out who's for you, who's against
you, and who's undecided. You ignore the folks who are pro and con and target
the undecideds <em>only</em>. (Obviously you target the FOR's for donations and
volunteer work, but you don't bother doorbelling or mailing them.)</p></li>

<li><p>Campaigns are not won so much as they are fumbled even worse by the
other guy. Successfull campaigning is a pretty straight-forward discipline that
few campaigns follow: find out who's undecided and doorbell, mail, doorbell,
mail. The day before the election you call up all the PROs and the undecideds
to "get out the vote."</p></li>

<li><p>Libertarians have a built-in fund-raising advantage over the other 
parties: a network of committed folks across the country. The Rs and Ds target
only about 35 races around the country (typically an important seat that they
won or lost the last time by < 5% of the vote.) That means that 99% of the
candidates are <em>not</em> funded by their party and have to handle their own
fund-raising and volunteering.  They are in the same position as we are.
Fund-raising is easier for Libertarians because we support candidates outside
our districts. The Rs and Ds typically don't.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There's obviously a lot more detail and how-to knowledge involved, so for
that I strongly recommend you spend the $35 to get his campaign manuals (we got
them as part of the seminar, and they are awesome!) To get a catalog, call
1-800-562-6624.  Good luck!</p>

<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/KenGaillot.html">Ken Gaillot</a></p>

<p>A shareware program is available to help manage
political campaigns. <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.digitals.org/digitals/pages/software.html">Precinct
Walker 3.1c</a> has three functions: a personal information manager
to keep track of contacts and the relationships between them; a
precinct manager to aid canvassing; and a "Democratic Toolkit"
containing information about recent politicians and their voting record.</p>

<p>Precinct Walker 3.1c is distributed by Digitals, but I believe
it is the same program that used to be distributed by Profile Software.</p>

<p>Although I haven't heard from anyone with experience using the
program in a campaign, Brent Jass (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:bwjass@cris.com">bwjass@cris.com</a>) downloaded and
tested it. Jass said, "Someone has used version 2.6 of FoxPro to create
the program ... I'm more inclinded to try learning Access. I may
still recommend Precinct Walker to others, especially since it looks
pretty self-explanatory."</p>

<h1>Nurses and Politics</h1>

<p>When running for political office, candidates often find
that nonpolitical interest groups to which they belong are a
great source of contacts and publicity. Sometimes publications
dealing with an industry will do stories on people in that
industry running for political office.</p>

<p>An example is health professionals.
<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/EricGarris.html">Eric Garris</a>,
a libertarian who works for <cite>Nurseweek</cite> and <cite>Nursing and
Allied Healthweek</cite> weekly magazines, says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><cite>Nurseweek</cite> goes to all nurses in California (200,000).
<cite>Nursing and Allied Healthweek</cite> goes to 120,000 nurses and allied
health professionals in Texas. They love to cover stories about nurses and
health professionals running for office, and sometimes who just are heavily
involved in campaigns.  They have done articles on the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
and libertarian candidates in the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A candidate who is a Registered Nurse in California, or
a Registered Nurse, Licensed Vocational Nurse, Occupational Therapist,
Physical Therapist, Physical Therapy Assistant, Pharmicist, Pharmacy
Assistant, Medical Social Worker, Dietitian, Radiologist, Medical Tech, or
other Allied Health field in Texas, should contact Garris for more
information.</p>

<title>Signature collecting</title>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Signature collecting for ballot access</h2>
<p>Last updated 8/23/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>The perfect place to get ballot access signatures is at polling places, 
on primary election day.</p>

<p>In <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania</a>,
Ken Krawchuk is running for a State House seat. He
decided to hit the polling places on primary day with a virtual army of
petitioners -- about 20, if I recall.  He needed approximately 300
signatures to make the ballot.  He got 1000, all on that one day.</p>

<p>Polling places are ideal for many reasons.  You can be sure that every
person coming up to vote is registered to vote in that district.  It gives
you a political presence.  People are getting hit with handouts anyway, so
they expect to be solicited.  The response is much more positive than in
other, more hostile petitioning situations.</p>

<p>You're also very visible to the opposition parties. The people handing out
literature are not generally hostile to other parties. This is just a task
for them.  From what I've seen, those people are not generally interested
in debating the role of government as they are interested in debating what
kind of pullover will best keep the rain away.  And chatting with the
opposition at this very grass-roots level is a good way to find out what
they're doing, and how they've become successful.  Find out what works and
copy it!</p>

<p>Finally, solicitation at polling places is one of the simple tasks that a
successful political party will do anyway, and we should get used to the
idea of recruiting people to do this kind of work.</p>

<p>One other reason for Ken's success -- he used his kids as petitioners.  Who
could resist a young girl asking people to sign for her dad?  And the
youngest kid apparently attracted the press -- she was the one who got the
quote in the local newspaper.</p>

<title>Campaign Activism: Signs</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Campaign Activism: Signs</h1>

<p>In a July 1996 post to the LPUS mailing list, Lance Flores detailed
the Libertarian Party of Dallas' experience with making campaign signs:</p>

<p>First, about the required disclosure. Most states require, although
unconstitutionally, the Candidate's Name, Organization (i.e. Committee to
Re-elect), Treasurer (make sure title is included) address of the
organization or treasurer, and occasionally the phone number. This is so you
may be found by the Code Enforcement people. They must normally give you
notice before removing your signs. (I have a Sec. 1983 suit withdrawn from
last season when I was running for judge concerning all of this) You can see
an example on <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://webusers.anet-dfw.com/~liberty/index.htm">our web page</a>
of what the disclosure looks like. I put it on
Steven May's sign, so look at his page under the "Election '96" section of
our site.</p>

<p>Now here is how the sign making works:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You will need a garage or warehoused space with plenty of area to dry
your signs. Some good dry summer days, and some enthusiasm.</p></li>

<li><p>Now draft the layout of your sign. Although this may seem easy, you can
make big mistakes trying to put too much message on the sign. Keep it simple
with enough open space to make it confortable to read from a
moving vehicle. (We've make all those mistakes already so you won't have to
wait until next season to fix them.) We did one color (blue) last season. We
are going to two colors on white background this year. We used a number of
different graphics last season. One of the mistakes is to use graphics that
are too detailed. This makes it difficult to print because the ink does not
hold seperation well because of some capillary attraction created when the
silk stretches as you squeegee the ink. The Libertarian lady liberty
masthead is ideal and well suited for silk screens. You can get the .tif
file from national for a few bucks. Well worth it.</p></li>

<li><p>Why a graphic? We've experimented with many things in the past. The LP
logo is very powerful, much more so than the stupid pachyderm and ass you
usually see. It says much.</p>

<p>Perception of numbers. One of the comments from last season from the
Republican and Democratic judicial candidates and others, was what an
aggressive race I ran specifically noting that my signs were everywhere.
They weren't. It just seemed that way. We all used similar statute of
liberty logos identifying the libertarian party. I put out 600, Steve May
put out about 75O, and others did similarly. Between all our candidates we
put out about 3000. It realy isn't much for an area like Dallas County which
has about twenty cities and a population of about three million.</p>

<p>What happens is this. Most R's & D's will not put the party logo or
identification on their signs. In Dallas only the Libertarians did this.
Some of the Republicans caught on to this last season and a few started
doing the same. People identify you with the logo. When driving around the
city they will see other libertarian signs. It takes at least three to four
passes for someone to remember your name on a political sign. People will
remember the logo. They will recognize the logo where ever they see it in
the city or county. When candidates all use the same or similar mastheads
all candidates will be preceived to be supported through out a vast area.
Its called synergy.</p></li>

<li><p>Your graphics should not be busy or crowded. Signs are to provide
recognition and the perception of substantial support of the populace. You
can't put the party platform on it! That's what the logo does. (Please look
at the various candidates that I have signs mounted on our web site. e.g.
John Davis, Steven May, Michael Needleman, Randal Morgan, mine isn't ready
yet.) If you're going to use two colors then try to use one common backdrop
like ours, then you will only need one mask and silk screen. We added a
border of stars at the top and bottom. This centers the viewer's focus to
the center of the sign where the message is and gives the sign balance.
Remember, the viewer is moving and you have to focus his eyes immediately on
the message.</p>


<li><p>Now for the nuts and bolts. Lay out your graphics on a good graphics
engine. I suggest Corel, Adobe, or somthing similar. You should try and use
a vector type graphic format or a bitmap with high resolution which will
convert to a vector format without too much distortion. You can save about
half the negative cost if you can give the negative producer the graphic in
the format he uses on his computer. If your supplier uses camera ready art
you will have to provide him a positive and he will shoot it twice to get
another positive.</p>

<p>I'll e-mail a sample of one of ours. We'll give you our background format if
you like. If you use one color you will only need one screen which will
print two images head to head. This will allow you to print both sides of
the sign at one time. You should keep designs proportanate to the size of
one half of the paper size. (14x 22") The paper is available in sheets 28x
22" when folded it makes the standard 14"x 22" sign.</p></li>

<li><p>Here's the materials list:</p>

	<ol>
	<li>22"x28" negative w/head to head image (leave space
	for fold and stake to pass through a hole at the top of sign);
        $48 shoot positive for a negative film, or
        $24 for a negative produced from .eps (encapulated post script) file
	in negative format</li>
  	<li>22"x28" silk screen w/frame coated & processed (aprox 30"x34")
        $23-$40</li>
  	<li>Coated paper 22"x28" ($0.52/sheet for 1-100, $0.45/sheet for
	up to 250, etc.)
  	<li>Ink - NAZ - DAR/Kc $27.35/qt. (1qt/candidate about 6-700 signs),
        $97.30 /gal
  	<li>Screen wash (clean screens & spreader) $19/gal   (1gal/candiate)
  	<li>Retarder $10.98/qt  (1/2 qt/candidate) $31.60/gal
  	<li>Dehazing fluid $25.75/gal (1qt/candidate)
  	<li>Squeeges are about $0.50/in. I'd get two per station. One 4"
	and one 12".
	</ol>

<p>Call your local screen supplier for the materials. This is the most current
pricing in Dallas. Get a NAZ-DAR/KC color chart from your Naz-Dar/KC
dealer. Nos 20(red) & 40(blue) work well but you can vary some.</p></li>

<li><p>Once you've located a place to do your signs, you'll need a table that is
not too wide. It should be about as wide as the screen frame, about 28". An
old door on saw horses is just perfect. Make a couple. Affix two door
hindges to the table and a silk screen frame with the screen mounted flush
on two sides.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Look at all the bill boards and signs on your way to work and back,
and when you go out at night. You will quickly see what
works and doesn't.</p>

<h1>Myths of Television</h1>

<p>From <cite>The 5 Myths of Television Power: Or, Why the Medium Is Not
the Message</cite> by Douglas Davis, 1993 Simon & Schuster, NYC:</p>

<ol>
<li>TV Controls Our Voting
<li>TV Has Destroyed Our Students
<li>TV Is (Our) Reality
<li>TV Pacifies Us (We Are Couch Potatoes)
<li>We Looove TV
</ol>

<p>"You won't see a lot of our ads...  The problems we face are difficult
and complex.  I believe you deserve more than 30 second commercials
with vague promises.  We want you to have a copy of our plan.  Call
us or visit your local library."   --- Lawton Chiles, 1990 TV spot</p>

<p>"Though widely praised, the campaign of Lawton Chiles for governor of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a> in November
1990 - or rather, its radical media strategy -
was kept secret, rather like the furtive romance of a priest or 
philosopher-king.  By contemporary standards, Chiles spent a pauper's
sum for television ($5M)... while... Martinez poured dollars into TV
($10M) with the free-spending abandon that has become routine for 
established American politicians...  He not only called TV power into
question: he proved it wrong... </p>

<p>"Chiles' success certainly discomfited most of all those who profit
from the wholesale commitment to TV power, that is, campaign managers
and TV exchequers across the land, which share a pie approaching $1G
every 4 years.  His victory even threatened those who regularly
denounce the medium's power, among them academics, columnists, and
nearly all politicians who lose hard-fought campaigns...</p>

<p>"Michael Robinson, a prof. of gov't at GWU... isolated 60 bitterly
contested primary campaigns in 1988, half D, half R: The candidate
who spent the most money on media and advertising lost in well
over half the elections (60%).  Among... losers... AlGore...</p>

<p>"...the cost of campaigns [increased] tenfold between 1970 and 1990.
The price for a race for a seat in the House... leaped 482% between
1975 and 1990 alone.  The average cost of a competitive senatorial
campaign climbed to $10M by 1988, 10 times the cost in 1974.  In 1988,
[Rs & Ds] together spent $50M on media.  By 1992, Bush alone began
the campaign with a budget of $40M targeted [at TV]."</p>

<p>"...network TV sees the viewer's mind as something like a tiny container
ventilated with holes - a school child's lunch box...  'The attention 
span of the average viewer is short.', Av Westin, ...ABC producer...</p>

<p>"Not that long ago, both politicians and their managers believed
differently.  Though pre-TV political campaigns were boisterous and
sensational, the candidates believed they had to elaborate positions
at length to be taken seriously by the voters, whether the positions
were directly read or herad at all.  In the 1950s... well into the 1970s
the genre of the 'half hour' film or live speech, when the candidate
laid himself on the line in detail, was assumed to be as critical to
victory as kissing babies.  Even in moments of crisis... compelled
to establish their gravity by unveiling positions patiently before the
microphone, the camera, or crowd, then passing out bulky treatises to
the press..."</p>

<h1><a href="index.html">Tips for Libertarian Activists</a></h1>
<h2>Campaigning: Using allied groups</h2>
<p>Last updated 11/10/94 by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a></p>

<p>[Here's a classic example of grassroots activism in action.
This is why we won.  Congrats to Peter and everyone else
around the country who participated one way or another in
campaigns, even if it was just dragging your friends to
the polls.  Great going Peter and others; this is exactly
how it's done!  -- <a
href="/revolution/by_name/C/JeffChan.html">Jeff C.</a>]</p>

<p>Date: Thu, 10 Nov 94 22:28 EST<br>
From: Peter Nesbitt &lt;0005111312@mcimail.com&gt;<br>
To: California Firearms &lt;ca-firearms@shell.portal.com&gt;<br>
Subject: Northern California Success!<br>
</p>

<p>Friends,

<p>We did it!  We cut 'em, we dried 'em, we rolled 'em, and we smoked a
bunch of anti-gun incumbents and challengers this past Tuesday.  It should
perfectly clear to the rest of the country that Grassroots created the
landslide that cleaned the hillside in D.C. and other State Capitols
throughout the country.</p>

<p>Congratulations to you all for a job well done.</p>

<p>After the June Primary was completed, the Fairfield/Suisun <a
href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a>
Members' Council sat down with four Candidates and members of their campaign
staff.  We discussed their campaign strategy, finances, and needs.  We
offered our membership with the understanding that no monetary donations
would be forthcoming from our group, just a lot of hard-working NRA
members.</p>

<p>Our monthly meetings then turned into strategy sessions; get to know
the candidate; and sign-up to work type of meetings.  We asked various
individuals from the community who had been involved with campaigns in the
past, to come and speak to our group.  The County Coordinators for these
four Candidates also attended.</p>

<p>These campaign leaders and experienced people set out with the
difficult task of bringing us up to speed in assisting their Campaigns.
Granted, we had a pretty active group, but we were clueless in the Campaign
arena, as it was our first time out.</p>

<p>We established a Campaign Point-Man within our group for each of the
four Campaigns.  The Point-Man would be directly responsible for working
with the Campaign and their County Coordinator.  The Point-Man would then
work through the Officers of our NRA Members' Council, and utilize a sign-up
sheet of volunteers, and any other personal contacts that might be
available, to accomplish any objectives that may be established by the
Campaign Staff.</p>

<p>Sign up cards were distributed at meetings, asking our membership
what they would be interested in helping out with.  We wanted to know if
they would: Walk precincts, make phone calls, assist with road-side signs,
place signs in their own yard, hold neighborhood meetings, work in the
Campaign HQ, work in the GOP HQ, assist with GOTV (get out the vote) on
election day, etc.</p>

<p>Clip-boards were passed around the room at each meeting, soliciting
volunteers to work for each Campaign.  The Campaign Coordinator and the
Point-Man each received copies of the sign-in sheet for their use.</p>

<p>At each monthly meeting we had boxes and boxes of candidate
information, flyers, bumper stickers, yard signs, and fence signs.  Each
member was asked to take what he could and distribute the material
throughout the community, and to friends and family.</p>

<p>For those people who could not normally attend the Thursday night
meeting, materials were delivered to their residence by one of our
volunteers.</p>

<p>All three gun stores in the local area were <em>very</em> active
participants, and made these materials available to customers who visited
their place of business.</p>

<p>Other businessmen in the community did the same, and one fellow
engaged in a sign war with the Fairfield office of Congressman Dan Hamburg.
Last I heard, Hamburg had run out of window space.</p>

<p>Each Campaign had a life of their own.  Frank Riggs ran a very
high-profile campaign, with many debates and public forums throughout the
1st Congressional District.  Riggs and Hamburg were constantly taking jabs
at each other in the press.</p>

<p>The LeFever campaign appeared to be low key, but I feel that was due
to the fact that our County only makes up a small portion of the 3rd
Congressional District.  We didn't hear very much from either Fazio or
LeFever here, but Fazio did attack LeFever on his stance on guns, abortion,
and religion.  The hit pieces called LeFever an "extremist".</p>

<p>State Senator Maurice Johannessen was without a doubt, the most
prepared of the Campaigns we worked for.  The County Coordinator, Bob Davis,
has been involved with several campaings in the past.  Bob was the first to
have a campaign office up and running in this county.</p>

<p>The Senator made his way through the newy reapportioned 4th Senate
District, gaining support as he went.  The Johannessen Staff knew in advance
what McGowan was going to hit them with.  A McGowan piece would hit the
mail, and the very next day Johannessen would drop his in your mail box.
They were <em>prepared for everything</em> that McGowan threw their
direction.</p>

<p>Bryant Stocking ran a campaign that was very low-profile, yet very
grassroots oriented.  He never attacked incumbent Assemblyman Tom Hannigan,
instead chosing to campaign on his own merits and beliefs, insisting that he
would be a breath of fress air for the 8th Assembly District.</p>

<p>I received many calls asking, "When will Bryant start slinging the
mud?".  The Stocking strategy was to let the sleeping giant sleep, he didn't
want to force Hannigan to campain, and was hoping to be a stealth win.  It
almost worked, and Hannigan never launched into any heavy campaigning.</p>

<p>We established teams of NRA members to travel throughout the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Solano.html">Solano
County</a> area, and place signs in strategic locations.  In many cases,
permission was granted from the land-owner for sign placement on some very
prime spots.</p>

<p>Copies of City and County ordinances were obtained from the
Registrar of Voters so that we would know where we could legally place our
signs.</p>

<p>During the final six weeks before the election, we began phone
banking for our four candidates.  On at least one night per week, we
assisted with one or more phone banks.  It all depended on how many people
were were able to muster during the prior week.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the campaign, several local Realtors and a credit
bureau came on-board with us.  There were a few nights when we had 18+
phones calling precincts throughout the county!</p>

<p>Several of our members agreed to make calls each week, while others
obtained precinct lists from the Campaign HQ and made the calls on their own
when they had the spare time.</p>

<p>During the final two weeks I obtained a partial copy of an NRA
Membership List from the Sacramento office.  The names were members who
resided in the 3rd Congressional District, and our group called most of the
NRA members in the Solano County area, with Sacramento NRA Members' Councils
calling the others.</p>

<p>We actually found a few people on the list who admitted to being FOR
gun control!  Tanya will be notified, and hopefully a strike team sent out
immediately.</p>


<p>Precinct walking was one of the most successful activities that we
participated in.  The local GOP HQ coordinated most of these, however some
campagns did their own work in this area.</p>

<p>Towards the end, all Campaigns were carrying each others material in
a combined effort to cover the whole county.  This was the first time in
many years that all targeted precincts were walked and phoned.</p>

<p>On the Monday before election day, another campaign sent down a bus
full of precinct walkers to the Johannessen campaign.  Myself and others who
were in possession of large vans, acted as shuttle crew members.  We each
took a van full of these walkers, provided them with a precinct list,
campaign material, and then dropped our payload in the appropriate precinct.
Later that afternoon, the walkers would call for pick-up, or to be
repositioned for another precinct.</p>

<p>Several debates and public forums were held in our area.  The dates
and times were mailed out to our membership, and we were instrumental being
present at these events to cheer, hoot, and holler for our candidate.</p>

<p>On several occaisions we were able to have probing questions asked
of our opponent, which was then printed in the local papers the next day.</p>

<p>Voter registration was an important activity during the early months
of the campaign.  Our Members' Council gained permission from the Solano
Mall to set-up a voter registration booth for a week.</p>

<p>While the number of voters who registered was rather dismal, we did
have a good time discussing the various gun issues with Mall patrons.</p>

<p>At one point, we were asked to help register voters in Yolo County
by a Republican group.  Several of our members assisted during the evening
hours at the Republican booth inside the State Fairgrounds.</p>

<p>All three of our local gun stores assisted various campaigns by
offering drawings for firearms.  While I don't recall the exact type of
weapons that were offered, there were only a limited number of tickets sold,
and they were all good fund-raising projects for our Candidates.</p>

<p>The signs for the Riggs campain were normally shipped to a Napa
address, so we made several trips to Napa and then distributed the signs to
various HQ's and individuals who had previously agreed to assist in placing
signs throughout the district.</p>

<p>Some of the small yard signs need to be stapled onto wooden stakes,
so we did that too.</p>

<p>Charlton Heston was supposed to fly into the Nut Tree airport on
October 30th to offer his support for Frank Riggs, but bailed out on the eve
of his visit.  We had already printed the info in our monthly newsletter,
flyers placed in gun stores and old-folks homes, press releases were mailed
out to local media outlets, and I phone-banked the day before.</p>

<p>It was pretty embarrassing to be there and tell everyone that Moses
wasn't going to make it.</p>

<p>One late night on the week before election day, a Riggs staffer
called me at 1:00 a.m.  He had been clued into a press conference the next
day at noon.  Apparently Congressman Dan Hamburg was going to have a
"Veterans for Hamburg" press conference, and announce an 8.2 million dollar
grant from the Government to build a new Veterans Hospital.  (Riggs laid the
groundwork for this when he was in office previously)</p>

<p>The next morning we were able to must 15 NRA members between 9:00
a.m. and 11:00 a.m.  We met at the GOP HQ, made anti-Hamburg signs, and
printed  original press-releses and news articles about the work of Frank
Riggs in bringing the VA Hospital to this area when he was in office.</p>

<p>We left the GOP HQ and marched through the downtown business section
of Fairfield to the old County Courthouse.  There were slightly more of them
than there were of us, and when we arrived on the scene, we were threatened
with arrest!  After explaining to the Hamburg Staff-puke that we were on
public property and that we were excercising our right to assemble, and the
right of free speech...well...they got real quiet, then called us jerks, and
finally walked away.</p>

<p>Hamburg and Martin Nellis (his Fairfield Field Representative)
walked up the sidewalk.  Hamburg didn't look too happy too see us there, as
we have been a pain in his neck for the last year.  Martin said, "Hey Peter,
don't be too depressed on the day after the election.", to which I snapped
back, "Oh don't worry, I won't.  We'll help you guys move out of your office
if you need the help!"</p>

<p>If looks could kill!  Both he and Hamburg stopped dead in their
tracks, and turned to us.  They were speechless.</p>

<p>Our people mixed in with the Hamburg folks and we had a video camera
there to record the whole thing.</p>

<p>While Hamburg was speaking, three of our people went to the street
corner with Riggs signs and posters.  As the big trucks drove by, they
motioned for them to blast their air horns.  The press conference was
disrupted on several occaisions by horns and people yelling their support
for Frank Riggs.</p>

<p>One last comment on this, one of the Hamburg staff knocked the
American Flag to the ground right after the event.  We offered to turn the
flag over to the local Vets group for ceremonial burning, but they refused.</p>

<p>Election morning we had 10 NRA members with another 10 Riggs
supporters on a street corner in Fairfield at 7:00 a.m.  Armed with a cup of
coffee, "Riggs for Congress" signs, a large banner, and "Honk for Riggs"
signs, we positioned ourselves at a major intersection.</p>

<p>Frank was right there with us too!  It was fantastic!  We split
ourselves into four groups, with one group on each corner.</p>

<p>As the morning traffic began to build, so did our excitement.
People were driving by waving and smiling, honking their horns, and giving
us the thumbs-up-signal.</p>

<p>People who were walking to work would stop and talk to Frank, and a
few people even pulled over to wish him luck in the election.  At 9:00 a.m.,
Frank looked at us and said, "Guys...we're going to win this election."</p>

<p>A local newspaper photographer came by for the photo opportunity,
and everyone lined up on the same corner with their signs and banners.</p>

<p>We then went to Suisun, and ate breakfast at "Bab's Delta Diner"
with Frank and many of his supporters.  As we sat there eating, I noticed my
Mayor and several City Council members a few tables over.  They were all Dan
Hamburg supporters, and would not even look towards the Riggs party.</p>

<p>Finally, Frank got up to say hello and wish them luck.  As I watched
this, I couldn't help but laugh to myself...when Frank wins the election,
these people will have to call him and ask for help at some point.  It will
certainly be a painful phonecall to make!</p>

<p>At 12:00 noon I was back at the GOP HQ.  Myself and other NRA
members were there to act as "poll watchers".  Basically, we were to take
precinct lists, drive to the polling place, then check off those Republicans
who had voted.  We would then return to the GOP HQ, hand the lists over to
other volunteers who would call the people who had not voted, and encrouage
to get out and vote.</p>

<p>Between 12:00 noon and 7:00 p.m., we each took 3-5 precinct sheets,
and made the rounds to the various precincts.  This was very mind numbing
and exhausting work.</p>

<p>On more than one occasion I ran into opposition forces doing the
same thing.  Since there was only one packet I was forced to wait while
several of them would drag their feet and try to go as slow as possible.  I
would just go to the next precinct, then return a short time later to finish
up after they had left the area.</p>

<h1>Libertarian Activism: Strategy and Tactics</h1>

<p>Sometime around 1991, Libertarian activist
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a> began
a series of tips, tactics, strategies, and case studies that became
known as "Tom's Tips" and proved invaluable to activists across
the country trying to learn how to grow their parties and run
campaigns. This web page has grown from that effort and now includes
articles from many people.</p>

<p>The premier resource for Libertarian activists is the outstanding
newsletter <cite>Libertarian Volunteer</cite>, edited by LP Communications
Director <a href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWinter.html">Bill Winter</a>.
It is simply the best newsletter in the libertarian movement. It is
written for LP volunteers, activists, officers, and candidates. If you are
one of those, send your request to Bill Winter to get on that mailing
list.</p>

<body>

<h1>Ernest Hancock</h1>

<p>Ernest Hancock has been Chair of the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a> of
Maricopa County,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a> since
December 1993. Maricopa County contains <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/Phoenix.html">Phoenix</a>.</p>

<p>As Hancock said in a May 12, 1995 posting to Libernet, his motivation stems
from a personal incident:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1989 I was exposed to very  bad corruption in the Arizona Department of
Commerce that extended to
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington D.C.</a> and
every elected position and
bureaucracy I came in  contact with. A young Republican at the age of 28,
married with 4 children, I was scared. I came face to face with some of the
most  powerful people in this country and was told how they knew what was  best
for me and my family. At this point I never even heard of the Libertarian
Party, But, I didn't need a platform or a Constitution to tell me what was
planned for this country was evil.</p>

<p>After presenting very damning evidence of corruption to a powerful  director
of a part of the U.S. Commerce Dept. in Washington, I was told,  "Yea Kid, and
what are you going to do about it?" Well, I told him that I didn't know what
one person could do ... but I was going to find out.</p>

<body>

<h1>Stan Dworkin's "Nolan Chart" Quiz</h1>

<p>From Stan Dworkin's son Matthew I. Dworkin (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:matt.dworkin@launchpad.unc.edu">matt.dworkin@launchpad.unc.edu</a>,

<a href="mailto:prufrock@genie">prufrock@genie</a>, <a
href="mailto:dante@genie">dante@genie</a>), on the results of his father's
"Nolan Test":</p>

<p>The following are the responses my father had, as far as I can recall,
when we discussed this.</p>

<ul>
<li>Military service should be voluntary. (No draft.)
<li>Absolutely.
<p>
<li>Gov't should not control radio, TV or the press.
<li>Yes (agree).
<p>
<li>Repeal regulations on sex by consenting adults.
<li>Maybe (would have to think about it).
<p>
<li>Drug laws do more harm than good. Repeal them.
<li>Maybe. Marijuana no problem, have to think about stronger ones.
<p>
<li>Let people immigrate and emigrate freely.
<li>No problem.
<p>
<li>Businesses and farms should operate without gov't subsidy.
<li>No problem.
<p>
<li>People are better off with free trade than with tarriffs.
<li>I don't recall his reaction to this.
<p>
<li>Minimum wage laws cause unemployment.  Repeal them.
<li>Sure.
<p>
<li>End taxes. Pay for services with user fees.
<li>I do not recall his reaction to this. I believe he was unsure what the
plan would be for this.
<p>
<li><a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe</a> and <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japan</a> should pay for their own
defense.
<li>Absolutely.
</ul>

<p>Stan Dworkin's overall rating is at least 80/60. According to the Nolan
Test,
this makes him a libertarian.</p>

<title>LPMC Formation</title>
<!-- Place: Montgomery County, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: November 1992 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Proposal for forming the Libertarian Party of Montgomery County,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a></h1>

<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/G/KenGaillotJr.html">Ken Gaillot Jr.</a></p>

<p>To achieve success at the national level, the Libertarian Party will need to
prove its competence and viability at handling public policy. Name recognition
and credibility at the state and local levels will help achieve this goal.
Local affiliates of the Libertarian Party, therefore, are valuable not only for
influencing public policy but also for building the case for libertarianism at
the national level.</p>

<p>I propose the formation of the Libertarian Party of Montgomery County
(LPMC), to be affiliated with the state and national LPs, to pursue the goals
of name recognition, credibility and influence over local public policy.</p>

<p>To succeed, the LPMC will need a thorough knowledge of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Media: the address, phone/fax numbers and advertising rates of all
newspapers, magazines, cable companies and TV and radio stations serving the
county.</p>

<li><p>Government: current officeholders, terms of office, geographical area
covered, etc., of all elective offices in the county.</p>

<li><p>Community: list of all charitable, religious, social etc. groups in the
county.</p>

<li><p>The libertarian movement: libertarian magazines and books dealing with
issues of interest in the county, outreach materials available from libertarian
organizations, etc.</p>
</ul>

<p>The usefulness of such information is obvious. The LPMC will need to use the
media for advertising and for coverage of any events sponsored. Knowledge of
government offices will allow the LPMC to run viable campaigns and to identify
officeholders who may be open to libertarian ideas. Voluntary groups in the
community can be targeted by the LPMC for outreach, and may be parts of
coalitions on specific issues. Access to libertarian resources will allow the
LPMC to use strategies that have worked elsewhere and to support positions on
specific issues.</p>

<p>Of course, to be successful the LPMC will also have to take an active role
in promoting libertarianism. Depending on the level of funding and volunteer
activism, the LPMC could, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Speak at local groups: representatives of the LPMC could speak to local
high school civics classes and to the voluntary community groups mentioned
before, either as an introduction to libertarianism or on specific issues.</p>

<li><p>Sponsor events: the LPMC could hold debates, candidate forums, seminars,
parties, protests and so forth.</p>

<li><p>Advertise libertarian ideas: the LPMC could run TV and radio commercials
promoting the Libertarian Party or libertarian viewpoints on specific issues.
This would also include letters-to-the-editor for county newspapers.</p>

<li><p>Run political campaigns: winning elective office should be a major goal
of the LPMC. Well-run campaigns and high-profile officeholders would go a long
way to establishing the LP's credibility.</p>
</ul>

<p>The goals of such actions include name recognition, outreach, fundraising
and press coverage. Speeches and debates will give potential candidates
speaking experience. Successful political campaigns will allow the LPMC to
advance libertarianism directly.</p>

<p>There are many specific events that a newly-founded LPMC, with minimal
funding and volunteerism, could sponsor. An affiliation ceremony (party)
marking the formation of the LPMC could strengthen links between the LPMC and
the Harris County and Texas LPs. LPMCers could write letters to the editor on
various issues. The LPMC could also protest Tax Day, memorialize Tiananmen
Square or speak to a civic group.</p>

<p>I have the experience necessary to get a libertarian organization off the
ground. While attending Louisiana State University, I re-activated the College
Libertarians at LSU, serving as president from 1987 to 1989 and as treasurer in
1990 and 1991. I organized many speeches, debates and outreach efforts for the
College Libertarians. I also collected signatures to get <a
href="/revolution/by_name/P/RonPaul.html">Ron Paul</a> on the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a> ballot
in 1988, and coordinated precinct walking for a Libertarian
campaign for the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/la/">Louisiana</a> State Senate
in 1991. I moved to the Woodlands,
Texas, in January 1992, and look forward to advancing liberty in Texas.</p>

<h1>Freedom of Expression</h1>

<p>One of the most fundamental of our freedoms is that summarized by the First
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: freedom of expression.</p>

<p>Freedom of expression includes everything listed in the First Amendment --
freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, freedom of
petition and freedom of assembly. Unfortunately the founding fathers couldn't
see into the future, and so omitted an equally important aspect of freedom of
expression: freedom of communication in any form, including broadcast and
electronic.</p>

<p>Closely tied to freedom of expression is privacy of communication.</p>

<title>FBI Targeted University President</title>
<!-- Place: Berkeley, California (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1962 - 1968 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>FBI Targeted University President for Political Views</h1>

<p>The FBI targeted supporters of the 1960's Free Speech Movement at
the University of California at
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/Berkeley.html">Berkeley</a>
for their political views, and
even tried to have the university's president fired.</p>

<p>The San Francisco <cite>Examiner</cite> reported that the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ordered the FBI to release documents showing the FBI's
involvement in domestic politics at Berkeley.</p>

<p>Clark Kerr was president of UC-Berkeley from 1962 to 1968, during which
time the Free Speech Movement and Vietman war protests were blooming at the
university. The FBI disapproved of his handling of student exercise of free
speech (J. Edgar Hoover himself called Kerr "no good"), and lobbied the
university's Board of Regents to have him fired.</p>

<p>The FBI also leaked information from the CIA to the Board of Regents
concerning left-wing political activities of university staff.</p>

<h1>U.S. May Sue Foes of Plan for the Homeless</h1>

<p>The First Amendment to the United States Consitution protects freedom

<p>The resident, Alexandra White, along with her husband Joseph Deringer
and neighbor Richard Graham, may be prosecuted under the Federal Fair
Housing Act. If convicted, they could receive a $10,000 fine plus
"restitution."</p>

<p>HUD is using the Fair Housing Act to silence critics of its programs.
The act prohibits housing discrimination on such basis as race, mental
illness or drug abuse. HUD officials claim private citizens' opposition
to housing programs on such grounds is itself housing discrimination.</p>

<p>As the <cite>Times</cite> reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HUD used the Fair Housing Act against an avowed white supremacist who
taunted and threatened a black resident in Vidor, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>.  An administrative
law judge ordered the racist to pay more than $300,000 for emotional distress
as well as $10,000 for discriminatory housing practices.</p>

<p>... Federal investigators asked for every article, flier and letter to the
editor that Ms. White, Mr. Deringer and Mr. Graham had written about the
Bel Air, as  well as minutes from any meeting they have spoken at, said
David Bryden, their lawyer.</p>

<p>Ann Brick, a lawyer with the <a href="/revolution/by_name/A/ACLU.html">
American Civil Liberties Union</a> of Northern 
California, called the HUD investigation disturbing.  "There's a big
difference between the HUD going after a government body denying permits
and going after citizens complaining about a project," Ms. Brick said.
"We may not find their opposition admirable, but it's a fundamental
right of citizens to make their views known."</p>

<title>Copyright</title>
<!-- Place: England (UK), USA -->
<!-- Time: 1600s? - present -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Copyrights</h1>

<p>Copyrights, and the idea of intellectual property in general, are an
interesting issue for libertarians. Does freedom of speech and of the press
include the right to repeat someone else's writings? Or is there a real
property interest in ideas?</p>

<p>Copyrights today are intended to allow the author of a work to gain the
benefits of the work, presumably encouraging the production of more such
works.</p>

<p>That's now how copyrights started. In 17th-century England, copyrights were
introduced as a government-sanctioned monopoly for booksellers in exchange for
the booksellers' acquiesence to restrictions on freedom of the press.
Copyrights were essentially a bribe to reduce opposition to the English
government's encroachment on individual rights.</p>

<p>The fact that copyrights are not permanent, but for a specific duration,
underscores the fact that they are a matter of privilege not right. Even if one
concedes the benefits of having copyrights, the duration of copyrights is still
a matter of debate.</p>

<p>The U.S. Constitution specifically authorizes Congress to set the duration
of copyrights, but says copyrights must be of limited duration. Congress has
somewhat stretched their authority by repeatedly extending copyright durations;
if they continue to do so, they will in effect be making copyrights
permanent.</p>

<p>In the U.S., copyrights lasted 56 years, until a 1976 law extended them to
75 years. As of May 1995, there is a proposal in Congress (H.R. 989 and S. 483)
to lengthen the duration to 95 years.</p>

<p>The "hard-core" libertarian approach to copyrights would be to abolish them
altogether, as a government-imposed monopoly. A more moderate approach would be
to lessen their duration.</p>

<title>Campaign Financing</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: study released September 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Campaign Finance Limits Ineffective</h1>

<p>When all the media and Congress agree on something, it's time to
check your shoes.</p>

<p>Campaign finance reform is not a lofty means of ending special interest
influence but instead is an unconscionable limit on free speech, ineffective
against special interests and a form of protection for incumbents.</p>

<p>In September 1995, the <a href="/revolution/by_name/C/Cato.html">Cato
Institute</a> released its Policy Analysis no. 238, "Campaign Finance
Regulation: Faulty Assumptions and Undemocratic Consequences", by Capital
University law professor Bradley A. Smith.</p>

<h2>Ineffective Against Special Interests</h2>

<p>"Special interests" (meaning everyone favoring government programs we
dislike) have always found ways around campaign finance limits and always
will.</p>

<p>The real problem is not that special interests can persuade Congress to
manipulate the economy, restrict individuals' choices and get the U.S.
entangled in foreign affairs. The problem is that Congress has the power
to do any of those things.</p>

<p>As long as Congress has the ability to give benefits to some people
at others' expense, people will vie to be in the "beneficiary"
category rather than the "benefactor" category.</p>


<h2>Protecting Incumbents</h2>

<p>Money does not close the political process but instead opens it.
Incumbents have name recognition and some identification with ideas;
challengers need to spend money to get the same. As Smith observes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although reform advocates say we spend too much on political campaigns,
total spending for candidates for all offices is less than $10 per eligible
voter every two years.</p>

<p>Because money is of much greater value to challengers than to incumbents,
higher spending opens up the political system to new people and ideas.</p>

<p>While many assume that large contributions are undemocratic, most
challenges to the status quo and most working-class political movements
have been financed by wealthy donors.</p>

<p>... Big spending does not guarantee success. Michael Huffington,
Lewis Lehrman, Mark Dayton, John Connally, and Clayton Williams are
just a few candidates who spent lavishly and lost.</p>

<p>The politicians who designed campaign finance laws rigged the system
to give incumbents an advantage. Even in the 1994 elections, 91.4 percent
of congressional incumbents seeking reelection won.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Restricting Free Speech</h2>

<p>Limits on campaign contributions restrict how and to whom a person may
show political support. Disclosure laws can be used to ban anonymous or
pseudonymous pamphlets, one of the primary means of communication in
the birth of the U.S. Public financing of campaigns forces taxpayers to
subsidize speech with which they disagree.</p>

<p>Campaign finance limits also give certain people's political speech
more weight than others. As Smith says, "campaign finance laws give
media moguls more opportunity than other wealthy people to support the
candidates they prefer."</p>

<h2>True Campaign Finance Reform</h2>

<p>A libertarian version of campaign finance reform would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dismantle the Federal Election Campaign Act and the Federal Election
	Commission bureaucracy</li>
<li>Reject proposals for public financing, which force taxpayers
	to fund campaigns</li>
<li>Return to the campaign "regulation" system found in the
	First Amendment -- "Congress shall make no law ...  abridging the
	freedom of speech."</li>
</ul>

<title>House Passes Free Speech Exception</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: June 28, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Free Speech, Except ..</h1>

<p>Republicans and Democrats have trouble with freedom. A <em>little</em>
freedom is fine, they say, as long as there are exceptions.</p>

<p>On June 28, 1995, the U.S. House approved a proposed constitutional
amendment to ban flag-burning. The measure passed 312-120, well over the
two-thirds majority required.</p>

<p>The Senate must also approve the measure by a two-thirds majority for it
to be sent to the state legislatures, three-fourths of which must approve it
for the amendment to become part of the Constitution.</p>

<p>The amendment would allow Congress and state legislatures to "prohibit
the physical desecration of the flag of the United States."</p>

<p>Libertarians believe in freedom, period, no and's, if's or but's. There's
no such thing as half-way freedom. Either you make your decisions, or someone
else makes your decisions. Congress and state legislatures have no moral
authority to tell individuals what they can do with their own property,
including flags.</p>

<h1>Quotes on Freedom of Expression</h1>

<hr>

<h2>FBI Director on Privacy</h2>

<p>If five years from now we [the FBI] solve the access problem, but what we're
hearing is all encrypted, I'll probably, if I'm still here, be talking about
that in a very different way: the objective is the same. The objective is for
us to get those conversations whether they're by an alligator clip or ones and
zeros.  Whoever they are, whatever they are, I need them.</p>

<p>-- FBI Director <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/LouisFreeh.html">Louis
Freeh</a>, clarifying statements that the FBI may seek
legislation to ban strong encryption, in an October 1994 interview with Steven
Levy.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Internet and Government</h2>

<p>Not just the Chinese government, but all governments, are concerned that
information on the Internet could cause social instability.</p>

<p>-- James Chu, chief executive officer of China Internet Corporation.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Gates on the Internet</h2>

<p>This revolution is more important than what has gone on in the last
twenty years.</p>

<p>-- Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, at Internet World 1995.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Cavett on Violence and Television</h2>

<p>There's so much comedy on television.  Does that cause comedy in 
the streets?</p>
<p>-- Dick Cavett</p>

<title>RAM Copyrights</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: original lawsuit 1992; Supreme court ruling February 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Court Rules RAM Infringes Copyright</h1>

<p>Only the owner of a software program can run it without infringing
the developer's copyright, according to a February 1996 U.S. Supreme
Court ruling. The decision could make independent computer service
companies illegal.</p>

<p>In <cite>Southeastern Express Co. vs. Triad Systems Corp.</cite>, the
Supreme Court rejected without comment an appeal of a federal judge's
decision. The judge had ruled that Southeastern infringed on Triad's
copyrights by servicing Triad computers. To service a computer, Southeastern
would load Triad's operating system software into RAM, thus making an
infringing copy of the software, even though the original was licensed
by the computer's owner and the copy was temporary.</p>

<p>As one friend-of-the-court brief said, "The 9th Circuit's
misinterpretation of copyright law will prevent independent service
companies from competing with manufacturers."</p>

<p>This is another example of technology outpacing the law. While
copyrights and patents may have a place, their extension into
digital media are not obvious.</p>

<hr>

<p>Source: February 26, 1996 Associated Press article, "Computer service
firms at risk in court order," reprinted in the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NandO.html">NandO Times</a>.</p>

<h1>Humor and Religion</h1>

<hr><h2>Particular Athiest</h2>

<p>When I told the people of Northern Ireland that I was an atheist,
a woman in the audience stood up and said, "Yes, but is it the 
God of the Catholics or the God of the Protestants in whom you don't 
believe?"</p>
<p>-- Quentin Crisp</p>

<hr><h2>Something Fishy</h2>

<p>A Catholic priest, Baptist minister and Jewish rabbi are fishing in
a boat. They run out of bait, but left their bait box on the shore.
The priest says, "I'll go get some more," steps out of the boat, and
walks across the water to the shore and back again. The rabbi is amazed
but says nothing.</p>

<p>A little later, they run out of bait again. This time, the minister
says, "I'll get it," steps out of the boat, and walks across the water
to the shore and back again. The rabbi wonders at this.</p>

<p>They run out of bait a third time. Now, the rabbi says, "This time
I'll get it." He steps out of the boat, and splash! falls in over his
head. The minister says to the priest, "Do you think we should have 
told him where the rocks are?"</p>

<hr><h2>Golfing</h2>

<p>A priest goes out golfing with a nun as caddy. On one hole the
priest slices terribly. "Damn! I missed!" he yells. "Father, you
shouldn't say such things," the nun says. "I'm sorry, sister,"
the priest says.</p>

<p>The next hole, the priest hits the ball way to the left. "Damn!
I missed!" he yells. "Father, you really should watch your language,
God doesn't appreciate that," the nun says. "I'm sorry, sister, it
won't happen again," the priest says.</p>

<p>On the next hole, the priest hits the ball into a sandtrap. "Damn!
I missed!" he yells. All of a sudden the sky darkens, thunder sounds,
and a lightning bolt flashes down and fries the nun. A big voice booms,
"Damn! I missed!"</p>

<hr>
<h2>Dangerous</h2>

<p>Q. What goes clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop, BANG!?</p>
<p>A. An Amish drive-by shooting.</p>

<h1>The U.S. Mail Monopoly</h1>

<p>Of all the ridiculous ideas thought up by advocates of big government,
one of the worst has got to be the idea that the U.S. federal government
should deliver all the mail in the entire country. What advantage does
government have in delivering mail? They keep costs down so well? They're
so in tune with the customer? I don't get it. Government is there, essentially,
to kill people or lock them up. That's what it's good at. Delivering the mail
is best left to private companies.</p>

<!-- Place: global -->

<body>

<h1>The Internet</h1>

<p>The Internet will rank with the printing press and the automobile as
innovations that revolutionized society. Science, government, commerce,
recreation and politics are all moving in new directions as the result of
the Internet. Information services are already estimated to comprise 50%
of the U.S. economy.</p>

<p>The encouraging thing is that the Internet is empowering individuals.
Hell, any old yahoo can set up his own web site and reach the world (see,
for example, <a href="/revolution/">Revolution</a>). As should be
expected, governments worldwide are trying to restrict the Internet and
its effects.</p>

<h1>The Telecommunications Act of 1996</h1>

<p>On Black Thursday, February 8, 1996, after a year of controversy, the
U.S. government enacted the <a href="act.html">Telecommunications Act of
1996</a>, censoring the Internet and other telecommunications networks.
The blatantly unconstitutional law prohibited the transmission of "indecent"
material and information about abortions on telecommunications networks
such as the Internet. Speech that would be perfectly legal in conversation
or in print was <a href="banned.html">banned in the U.S.A.</a>.</p>

<p>In June 1996, a panel of federal judges found that the First Amendment
of the United States Constitution applies to the Internet, guaranteeing
free speech and rendering the indecency provisions of the law null and
void.</p>

<h2>The Exon Act</h2>

<p>On February 1, 1995, U.S. Sen. James Exon (D-<a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ne/">Nebraska</a>) introduced
the Communications Decency Act. His proposal broadened existing
law by subjecting individuals to up to a $100,000 fine or two years in prison
for any "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" message transmitted
over a telecommunications network to a minor or with intention to "annoy,
abuse, threaten or harass."</p>

<p>The initial language of the bill additionally made the telecommunications
network provider (such as an Internet provider or telephone company) criminally
liable for such actions of their users. Later amendments removed this
provision, although providers would still be held liable if they are aware
of the transmission or if they do not a "reasonable effort" (defined by the
FCC) to prevent minors from accessing the material.</p>

<p>In March 1995, the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously adopted
a version of the Exon proposal as an amendment to the telecommunications
reform bill. In June 1995, the Senate attached the Exon amendment to the
telecommunications reform bill by a vote of 84-16. On February 1, 1996,
the final bill passed the Senate by a vote of 91-5, and the House of
Representatives by a vote of 414-16. On February 8, 1996, the bill was
signed into law by President Clinton.</p>

<h2>The Internet Reaction</h2>

<p>The Internet community reacted strongly to the threat.
115,000 Internet users signed an online petition to stop the
Exon bill. When the bill passed, thousands of World Wide Web sites protested,
many by participating in a <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.vtw.org/speech/">Web blackout</a>
(setting web pages' backgrounds to black) and displaying images of a
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.eff.org/BlueRibbon/">blue ribbon</a>. Protesters
<a href="winter.html">rallied</a> outside the White House after the
bill passed.</p>

<p>The ACLU challenged the law twice in court, first getting the
Department of Justice to agree not to enforce the law for seven days
while constitutional issues are settled, and then to
<a href="ciec.html">challenge the law</a> in a broad coalition.
An online newspaper <a href="challenge.html">challenged
the law</a> with an indecent commentary on it. Senator Patrick Leahy
offered a <a href="leahy.html">bill to repeal it</a>.</p>

<p>As a result of the challenges, a panel of federal court judges was
convened to decide the issue. On June 12, 1996, the panel unanimously rules
that free speech applies to the Internet, rendering the indecency
provisions unenforceable. The Clinton administration promises to
appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.</p>

<h2>The Meaning of It All</h2>

<p>This asinine affront to American rights exemplefies the approach
of freedom-killers. Today's would-be tyrants always invoke "the children."
The same people who are bankrupting the country; who are ensuring there
will be no <a href="/revolution/community/welfare/ss/">Social Security</a>
remaining when the next generation retires; who are sending American kids
overseas to fight foreign wars; who are diminishing in every respect
U.S. citizens' birthrights of property and freedom; these
are the people who want to protect children! These are the honorable men
and women, trying to protect us. God save us from our protectors.</p>

<p>Note to U.S. voters: this law enjoyed the widespread support of both
Democrats and Republicans. Bob Dole voted for the Exon amendment, as did
supposed "libertarian Republicans" like Phil Gramm, Jon Kyl, Connie Mack and
Paul Coverdell. Democrats were no better, with the Clinton administration
leading the charge. Only Libertarians are worth your vote! The
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
was the <em>only</em> political party that participated in the net-wide
anti-CDA campaign, the <em>only</em> party to participate in the Web
blackout, and the <em>only</em> party to condemn the censorship.</p>

<title>H.R. 185 (Telecommunications Drug Enforcement Act of 1995)</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: March 1995 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>Telecommunications Drug Enforcement Act of 1995</h1>

<p>March 19, 1995, posted by Frank Lofaro (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a href="mailto:ftlofaro@unlv.edu">ftlofaro@unlv.edu</a>) to
<img src="/images/news.gif" alt="[NEWS]"><a
href="news:comp.org.eff.talk">comp.org.eff.talk</a>:</p>

<p> HR 185, the Telecommunications Drug Enforcement Act of 1995 would
mandate that the courts order the disconnection and/or refusal of
mobile phone service to anyone the Federal or a State government can
show <em>probable cause</em> that said person is involved in drug trafficking.</p>

<p> A conviction is not needed, just the same standard used to give a
search warrant. Probable cause is quite easy to prove. One anonymous
tip often does the trick. When the government gets that, they can
<em>compel</em> any public or <em>private</em> carrier to disconnect and/or
refuse service. Basically the government can just order anyone's service
turned off and/or refused. With the probable cause standard it is
quite easy (trivial in fact) for them to at least temporarily get
anyone off the air that the government does not like, or is
communicating anything the government does not want communicated. The
bill says people can still pursue remedies to get service restored or
any government mandated refusals lifted, but that could take a very
long time, up to (possibly even beyond) the length of a trial. During
all this time, an innocent person could be denied mobile service.</p>

<p>Consider that this would also effect mobile Internet sites (they still
need to use mobile communications). Consider that this would open the
door for expansion beyond just mobile services. Consider that this
could very well be the first step to the mandating of an off switch in
every network hookup that the government could flip any time they felt
something was obscene, threatened national security, was used in drug
trafficking, or was something they did not like.</p>

<p>Remember, probable cause does <em>not</em> require due process! Consider
that the government could cut service if they even thought such transmission was
likely to occur in the near future. You could start saying something
controversial and get cut off, courtesy of Big Brother. And anyone refusing to
implement such a cut off mechanism or trying to bypass or prevent such a block
would be prosecuted, probably for a felony (long prison, government
takes half your rights away for life).</p>

<hr>

<p>Side note: a reader noted that "probable cause" means "articulatable 
facts which by themselves would lead an ordinary person of prudence to
believe that a crime has occurred and that a specific person has committed,
or is about to commit a crime."</p>

<p>The main points of the above message are still relevant -- probable
cause is not being used in this case to get a search warrant, but to
cut off a person from telecommunications access in a society where that
is becoming increasingly important. A central concept of our legal
system is that the higher the stakes, the greater the burden of proof
is on the state. Probable cause is enough for a search warrant, but
not for the death penalty. Taking away liberties, such as being able to
communicate freely, should only be done upon conviction of a crime.</p>

<title>Telecom Law</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: February 8, 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Telecom Law Deregulates, Regulates</h1>

<p>On February 8, 1996, the U.S. government enacted a new telecommunications
law. On the good side, the law extensively deregulates significant aspects
of the telecommunications industry, from cable to local phone service. On
the bad side, the law increases regulation of content (<a
href="/revolution/express/techno/exon/">censorship</a>) in
telecommunications including the Internet.</p>

<p>The law is the first major overhaul of U.S. telecommunications policy
since 1934. Since 1984, local and long distance telephone service has been
under control of the consent decree signed at the breakup of the
AT&amp;T monopoly. The new law replaces the consent decree, and amends
the 1934 law.</p>

<p>Positive aspects of the law include:</p>
<dl>

<dt><p>Local phone companies will be allowed to offer long distance
service.</p>
<dd><p>The seven RBOCs (Regional Bell Operating Companies, or Baby Bells)
plan to enter the long-distance market in the next few years.</p></dd>

<dt><p>Local phone service will no longer be a monopoly.</p></dt>

<dt><p>Pricing will simplify.</p></dt>
<dd><p>With repeal of current rules, flat rate per minute long distance calls
may become common.</p></dd>

<dt><p>New areas of competition make "bundles" possible.</p></dt>
<dd><p>With fewer restrictions, many companies will compete to be
a single source of telecommunications services by offering bundles
including local phone, long distance, cellular, entertainment and
Internet services.</p></dd>

<dt><p>Broadcasting will have fewer restrictions.</p><dt>
<dd><p>Broadcasters have been restricted in their market reach by
various arbitrary numbers, like no more than twelve television stations
reaching 25% of the country. The new law's arbitrary limits are fewer
and higher, allowing companies to own any number of TV stations, but
no more than 35% reach.</p></dd>

<dt><p>Cable price regulation will be ameliorated.</p></dt>
<dd><p>After 1999, cable service beyond the "basic tier" will not
be price regulated.</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>The above changes will likely result in a wave of mergers, split-ups,
acquisitions and divestitures as the market realigns itself to natural
boundaries.</p>

<p>Competition will likely result in a lowering of
prices, although increased demand for telecommunications services tends
to counteract this effect. In the short term, local phone rates may rise,
as they have been previously subsidized by long-distance access charges,
and competitors will need time to install completely separate networks.</p>

<p>Negative aspects of the new law include:</p>
<dl>

<dt><p>Big Brother in your TV set.</p></dt>
<dd><p>The new law mandates that all new television sets include the
"V-chip," a computer chip that will block out "violent" programming as
determined by an industry board operating under a government chilling
effect.</p></dd>

<dt><p><a href="/revolution/express/techno/exon/">Big Brother
on the Internet.</a></p></dt>
<dd><p>The unconstitutional Exon amendment censoring the Internet was
included in the final law.</p></dd>

<h1>Cryptography</h1>

<p>Cryptography is the art of making and breaking codes. Crypto is
at the center of electronic privacy, being able to communicate privately
with whom you choose -- and keeping everyone else, including
government agents, from listening in.</p>

<p>The United States considers encryption technology a munition,
putting it under the same export controls used for nuclear weapons.
Ironically, the computer source code for an encryption algorithm can
be exported outside the United States without controls, but an
electronic copy of the same code is restricted.</p>

<title>Clipper Chip</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Clipper Chip</h1>

<p>The "Clipper Chip" is a general name for a proposal originating in the
Bush administration and pushed by the Clinton administration to establish
a federal encryption standard that includes a "back door" for law
enforcement.</p>

<p>Clipper is actually comprised of several parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Skipjack encryption algorithm, which is classified, forms the
basis for the Clipper components.
<li>The Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) is intended to replace the current
Digital Encryption Standard (DES). EES involves components using the Skipjack
algorithm, with skeleton keys held by federal agencies. Law enforcement
officials (with a warrant of course, trust us) could obtain the escrowed
keys to decrypt any EES-encrypted data.
<li>The Clipper chip itself implements EES for telephones.
<li>The Capstone chip implements EES for computers.
<li>The Tessera card is a PC card containing Capstone.
</ul>

<p>When the Clinton White House announced plans to implement EES, the online
community reacted strongly. As a result, plans for Capstone and Tessera were
put on hold. Although the administration initially said they never intended
to ban other means of encryption, FBI director <a
href="/revolution/by_name/F/LouisFreeh.html">Louis Freeh</a> later said he would
seek such a ban if criminals didn't use EES (duh).</p>

<p>EES met strong online opposition, and several Congressman promised to
block appropriations for EES. After the 1995
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a>
<a href="/revolution/multi/war/okc/">Federal Building bombing</a>,
reptilian opportunists like Clinton seized the chance to rush through a
Counter-Terrorism Bill, which included funding for Clipper.</p>

<p>To try to rescue the sinking Clipper Chip, U.S. federal agencies
proposed a variation called Commercial Key Escrow, in which private
companies would hold the skeleton keys and provide them to police
when presented with a warrant.</p>

<p> ... the little-noted launch of a gargantuan satellite from Cape
Canaveral on May 3.</p>

<p> The $1.5 billion satellite is a joint project of the NSA and the
National Reconaissance Office (NRO).  At five tons, it is heavy enough
to have required every bit of thrust its Titan IV launcher could
provide -- and despite the boost, it still did enough damage to the
launch-pad water main to render the facility unusable for two months.</p>

<p> The satellite is variously known as Mentor, Jeroboam and Big Bertha, and
it has an antenna larger than a football field to carry out
"hyper-spectral analysis" -- Reconnaissance buzzwords for real-time
analysis of communications in a very wide swath of the electromagnetic
spectrum ...</p>

<p> Mentor surprised space analysts by moving into a
geostationary orbit.  Geostationary orbit allows the satellite to "park"
over a certain sector of the earth.</p>

<p> This first satellite in a planned series was heading for the Ural
Mountains in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russia</a> at last notice. 
Additional launches planned for
late 1994 will park future Mentors over the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p> According to John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists, those
satellites will likely be controlled from Buckley Field
(<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/co/Aurora.html">Aurora</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/co/">Colorado</a>),
an NSA/Reconnaissance downlink base slated to become this hemisphere's
largest intelligence base in the 1990's.</p>

<p> Multiple Mentors will make it easy for technical intellicence agencies to
perform an unannounced "breakout" from their pledges to refrain from
domestic surveillance.  That is in addition to mandated use of
<a href="/revolution/express/techno/crypto/clipper/">Clipper</a>
and the Digital Signature Standard -- a requirement that will give the NSA
and National Reconaissance Office the capability in theory, if not in
practice -- to monitor all Internet and National Information
Infrastructure traffic anywhere in the world.  Given the ambitions of
the NSA and Reconaissance, Clipper's opponents may have confined their
arguments to too limited a scope.</p>

<title>Urgent Express Mail</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>USPS Claims Monopoly Over Non-Urgent Mail</h1>

<p>Few people realize that sending mail via Federal Express or other private
carrier is illegal unless the mail is "urgent." And guess what, the Post Office
gets to define urgent.</p>

<p>As reported in the December 20, 1993 <cite>Washington Post</cite>
("Enforcing Its Monopoly To the Letter at USPS"), the U.S. Postal Service
fined credit reporting company Equifax Inc. $30,000 for using private shippers
for routine letters and financial statements.</p>

<p>As the <cite>Post</cite> said, "the majority of U.S. companies probably
violate the law routinely out of simple ignorance."

<p>U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Georgia) introduced legislation in 1993 to
prevent penalties for private carrier use. (An interesting aside is that
Coverdell was elected with Libertarian help.)</p>

<p>The <cite>Post</cite> quoted a postal spokesman as given the age-old
"cream-skimming" argument:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The Postal Service was established to give universal service to
everybody at the same rate, whether you're in the bush country of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ak/">Alaska</a>
or the bottom of the Grand Canyon," said spokesman Paul Griffo.
"In order to provide that service you can't have people skimming off
lucrative areas of our revenue."</p>

<p>... Griffo said postal inspectors conducted 12 audits in the past year and
identified $312,000 in potential lost revenue, compared with two
audits the previous year in which $89,000 in lost revenue was identified.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that argument were true, then why not declare "bush country" open to
competition? Because the Post Office would get flattened even in the
areas with the smallest profit margin. They're bloated and inefficient and
they know it.</p>

<title>Hong Kong Shuts Down Internet Providers</title>
<!-- Place: Hong Kong -->

<body>
<h1>Hong Kong Shuts Down Internet Providers</h1>

<p.From a March 8, 1995 press release by Philip Wong, Chairman of Asia Online
Ltd.:</p>

<p> On Friday March 3, 1995 the offices of Asia On-Line were raided by
officers of <a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/HongKong/">Hong Kong's</a>
 Commercial Crime Bureau accompanied by officials
of the Office of the Telecommunications Authority, or OFTA. Our
equipment was seized and our on-line services were shut down. According
to the police at the time of the raid, police statements since and the
wording of the search warrant, the raid was for operating a
telecommunications service without a licence.</p>

<p> This raid occurred while we were in active dialog with OFTA about
obtaining proper licensing. I myself held a meeting with OFTA four days
before the raid. I was told that the licensing issue was still under
investigation and that our services were not in danger. However, to be
on the safe side, we wrote a letter to OFTA and began the process of
applying for a PNETS licence anyway. OFTA has also publicly stated that
the telecommunications ordinance, which was written long before the
Information Super Highway existed, has many grey areas that needed
clearing up before the licensing issue could be resolved. In a letter of
January 19, OFTA said that it would advise us on licensing requirements
and procedures once their investigations were complete.</p>

<p> OFTA now claims that it did not initiate the raids and only took part as
technical advisers. They further said in a statement that the raid was
part of a CCB investigation into computer hacking. The police have never
made any mention of computer hacking.</p>

<p> We believe miscommunication between these two organisations has resulted
in a serious blunder which could affect Hong Kong's worldwide reputation
for freedom of information and fair business practices. About 10,000
people have suddenly been cut off from their worldwide links through the
Internet, some of whom rely on this for their livelihood. Potentially 40
million people on the Intemet have been cut off from Hong Kong. In
short, Hong Kong has been isolated from the world's Information Super
Highway.</p>

<p> Six other companies offering similar services were also raided and shut
down on the same day.</p>

<h1>Malaysia Offended by Internet</h1>

<p>The <a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Malaysia/">Malaysian</a> government
is offended that people are criticizing
Malaysia on the Internet. Information Minister (what an Orwellian title)
Mohamed Rahmat condemned the dissent, saying that Malaysian students abroad
are smearing the country's good name and the government is considering
laws to curb such "abuses." Rahmat suggested that people seeking information
about Malaysia read officially sanctioned sources such as <cite>The Star</cite>
and <cite>Berita Harian</cite> newspapers.</p>

<p>Awww, we're sorry, we never meant to offend any anal bureaucrats in some
country that can't tell its information policy from a hole
in the ground. <b>Revolution</b> extends a hearty welcome to all Malaysians
who have disobeyed their government and read this page!</p>

<h1>Vietnam Prepares to Join the Internet</h1>

<p>In January 1996,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Vietnam/">Vietnam</a>
 installed the equipment for its first
full, commercial link to the Internet. The Vietnamese government
controls the link and set it up to block material they do not want.</p>

<p>Vietnamese dissident Ha Si Phu's 1995 arrest brought no internal
publicity and little international publicity in major media, but the
Internet spread the news to every corner of the globe. As has become
common with repressive regimes across the world, overseas citizens
are using the Internet to criticize the government and call for reform.</p>

<p>The Vietnamese government exercises a high degree of control over
information, selectively monitoring telephone and fax calls, requiring
permission for satellite dishes, and censoring foriegn publications entering
the country. Despite these efforts, banned material thrives in an
underground market. The Internet will prove even more difficult to control.</p>

<p>Only a small fraction of the 70 million Vietnamese have access to
the one of the estimated 60,000 computers in the country. Communications
infrastructure is growing however; Vietnam now has thousands of international
telephone lines, compared to nine in 1987.</p>

<p>Six organizations currently provide email access to the Internet in
Vietnam.</p>

<p><b>Revolution</b> extends a hearty welcome to any Vietnamese citizens
who have thwarted their government in reaching this page.</p>

<title>Arabs Censor Internet</title>
<!-- Place: Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain -->
<!-- Time: Jordan access contract 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Arabs Try to Censor Internet</h1>

<p>Other than speech, the Internet may well be the most successful means
of communication invented by man. It is decentralized, resilient and
easily used by individuals. As such, it is a threat to governments worldwide,
who universally desire to limit the information seen by their subjects.</p>

<p>The Arab world presents one of the most obvious examples. Middle
Eastern dictatorships like Saudi Arabia, Jordon, Kuwait and Bahrain
seek to prevent their subjects from accessing pornography, dissident
views of government and criticism of the Muslim faith. Warming the
hearts of conservatives everywhere, the Arabs "get tough" by torturing,
maiming, imprisoning and fining violators.</p>

<p>In a worldwide trend, the Arab dictatorships are attempting to gain
the economic benefits of Internet access while preventing the Internet
from undermining their tyranny. Of course, they don't have a choice about
either; free-minded citizens find ways around the government to accomplish
both. Many Saudi citizens pay $100 in long distance charges to download
a single pornographic picture from the Internet, risking serious punishments
in addition to the high phone charges.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Jordan/">Jordan</a> contracted with
GlobeNet, a U.S. firm, to provide Internet access
with a screening facility allowing Jordanian censors to preview pictures
before they can be transmitted to subscribers. Carlton Tolsdorf, vice president
of GlobeNet and reprehensible reptile, said "We agreed with the authorities'
request. And, by the way, I think we shouldhave the same thing back home in
the United States."</p>

<p>As is becoming common, exiled dissidents from the dictatorships are
using the Internet to spread news repressed by official media and to
criticize government actions.</p>

<p>An interesting facet unique to the Middle East is that the Internet
may actually serve to lessen the millenia-old hatred between Israelis and
Arabs, by allowing ordinary people to see beyond the official propaganda
of their governments. Although most Arab nations ban contacts with Israel,
Israeli sites including the Jerusalem Post proliferate on the Internet.</p>

<p><b>Revolution</b> extends a hearty welcome to any Arabic freethinkers
who have evaded their government's restrictions to see this page.</p>

<title>China and the Net</title>
<!-- Place: China -->
<!-- Time: February 15, 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>China Gets Wired</h1>

<p>On February 15, 1996, China ordered all Internet users to register
with the police within thirty days.</p>

<p>The Internet is revolutionizing every aspect of society. One of its
effects is empowerment of individuals, which makes totalitarian
governments (and wannabes) wary of connecting to it. At the same time,
economic and military reality dictates that advanced information technology
is essential to survival in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>

<p>The totalitarian Communist dictatorship of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/China/">China</a> is now attempting to
get Chinese universities on the Internet, while at the same time prevent
dissenting opinions, pornography and other unwanted material.
Already, about six thousand computers in China are connected to the
Internet. The state-run Xinhua News Service reported that China had
40,000 Internet accounts as of July 1995. The actual number is likely
much higher.</p>

<p>The Boston <cite>Globe</cite> reported that Chen Tongbao, director of the
new-technology division in China's Bureau of Scientific and Technical
Information, praised the benefits of the Internet for scientific research,
but said, "information coming from the Internet is closely related
to cultural, social and political issues. Some unhealthy information comes in
-- information that is not good for young people." Chen noted that "it is
very difficult to prevent" discussion of disapproved material.</p>

<p>To put it another way, young people armed with information are not good
for Communist dictatorships.</p>

<p>China believes it can limit Internet access to scientific and technical
disciplines without giving hackers and dissenters a chance to express their
version of the Internet society. Among China's ideas is China Internet
Corporation, for commercial Internet use and controlled by the state-run
Xinhua News Agency. Users must access the 'net in Xinhua offices.</p>

<p>Another more chilling idea was the Ministry of Public Security's
February 1996 directive to all users of the Internet and other
international computer networks to register with the police within
thirty days of signing up for service or switching service providers.
Yang Zhihui, a cog in the censorship bureaucracy, was quoted as saying
registration would "promote the healthy development of the country's
information industry."</p>

<p>Another straightjacket on the Internet is China's bottlenecks:
the Ministry of Post Telecommunications is the sole (legal) provider
of connections between Chinese computer users and international networks,
and Xinhua is the censor for foreign news agencies that want to
provide economic news services to Chinese customers.</p>

<p>James Chu, chief executive officer of China Internet, says "not just the
Chinese government, but all governments, are concerned that information on
the Internet could cause social instability."</p>

<p><b>Revolution</b> gives a hearty welcome to all Chinese citizens who have
managed to circumvent their country's controls to view this page!</p>

<title>Singapore Licenses Internet</title>
<!-- Place: Singapore -->

<h1>Singapore Licenses, Restricts Internet Service</h1>

<p>Governments have always tried to restrict the flow of undesirable
information -- undesirable to them anyway. The Internet stomps all over
these plans, routing information in such a way to make censorship practically
impossible. Of course, that doesn't stop governments from trying.</p>

<p>In March 1996, the Singapore government announced that all Internet
service providers <em>and content providers</em> in the country must
be licensed by the Singapore Broadcast Authority. The government
prohibits pornography, hate literature and other information
not in accordance with "local values" (government interests).</p>

<p>Providers like schools, libraries and Internet cafe&eacute;s must not
only censor their users' content, but also supervise use of public
terminals.</p>

<p>An estimated 100,000 Singaporeans use the Internet. Revolution
extends a hearty welcome to Singaporeans who defy their government
to view criticism of it!</p>

<h1>Banned Magazine Goes Online</h1>

<p>Sometimes, even governments can be cool, even if they don't really
want to be.</p>

<p>In March 1996, the
<A href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Indonesia/">Indonesian</a> government
allowed the staff of
<cite>Tempo</cite> magazine to publish an online version, even though
the government banned the print version of the magazine in June 1994,
on the grounds that it threatened national stability.</p>

<p>The Indonesian Information Minister told the parliament that there
was no need to consider the subject, as Indonesia does not yet regulate
the Internet. "They may enter the Internet, everyone may," he said.</p>

<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a

<h1>Internet Protects Financial Privacy</h1>

<p>A little government always leads to more government. As governments
find themselves incapable of eliminating victimless crimes, they instead
turn to broader measures to spy and snoop on everybody. These measures
include wiretapping, banning encryption and examining people's financial
transactions.</p>

<p>Trying to protect your privacy by hiding such information from
the government is known variously as tax evasion and money laundering.</p>

<p>The Internet, with its wanton disregard for national boundaries and
laws, poses a unique threat to governments trying to persecute people
for peaceful actions.</p>

<p>The U.S. government has lately been hinting that the Internet needs
more controls to prevent money laundering. In a March 1996 speech,
a representative of the Treasury Department's financial crimes
enforcement division said that anonymous international cash transfers
made possible by the Internet could make it very difficult for
goverments to invade financial privacy (I mean, stop money laundering).</p>

<title>French ISPs Protest</title>
<!-- Place: France -->
<!-- Time: May 8 - 14, 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>French ISPs Protest Arrests, Shut Down Usenet</h1>

<p>In early May 1996, French police shut down France's two largest
Internet access providers and arrested their top executives after finding
child pornography in Usenet, an Internet service for discussion groups
carried by the providers. The heads of FranceNet and WorldNet face up to
three years in prison and around US$100,000 in fines.</p>

<p>Internet providers across France responded by staging a "strike,"
closing off access to the entire Usenet collection of thousands of
discussion topics beginning May 8. The strike ended May 14 after
French Telecommunications Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon agreed
that providers should not be held liable for their users' actions.</p>

<p>Most Usenet groups are freely accessible, allowing anyone to
read and write messages on any topic. The Internet provider industry
has generally argued that providers should be viewed as similar to
telephone companies with regards to not being liable for their
users' conversations if illegal.</p>

<p>France also restricts speech on other topics, such as racism
and World War II.</p>

<h1>United Arab Emirates Want to License Internet</h1>

<p>The Middle East, with its Muslim dictatorships, is one of the
most censorious areas of the planet. Political, religious and
sexual expression is heavily restricted. The Internet poses a
direct threat to this order, empowering the individual to access
information and resisting all attempts at restriction.</p>

<p>In June 1996, the police chief of Dubai,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/UAE.html">United Arab Emirates</a>
called for the state information ministry and the police to issue
"Internet licenses" rather than the 60% state-owned telecommunications
company. In response to the criticism, the company pulled its
representative from the government board overseeing Internet use.</p>

<p>A local newspaper quoted the police chief,
"In all cases, the information should be filtered, scanned and then made
available to users."</p>

<p>The <b>Revolution</b> issues a hearty welcome to anyone in
the UAE who circumvented their government to read this page!</p>

<h1>Steve Jackson Games Vs. The U.S. Government</h1>

<p>I was forwarded this account by Joe Abernathy of <a
href="/revolution/by_name/J/SteveJackson.html">Steve Jackson</a> Games'
lawsuit against the Secret Service. I am unsure how to get in touch with the
author and whether this is freely distributable or not. I'm assuming it
is ...</p>

<h2>Steve Jackson Games/Secret Service Lawsuit -- Day One</h2>

<p>by Joe Abernathy</p>

<p> AUSTIN -- Plaintiff's attorneys wrested two embarrassing admissions 
from the United States Secret Service on the opening day of a federal 
civil lawsuit designed to establish the bounds of constitutional 
protections for electronic publishing and electronic mail.</p>

<p> In the first, Special Agent Timothy Foley of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>
admitted that 
crucial statements were erroneous in an affidavit he used to conduct 
several search-and-seizure operations in a March 1990 crackdown on 
computer crime.</p>

<p> Foley later conceded that the Secret Service's special training for 
computer crime investigators overlooks any mention of the law that 
regulates the extent of permissible search-and-seizures at publishing 
operations.</p>

<p> The case, brought by Steve Jackson Games, an
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Austin.html">Austin</a>
firm, is being 
tried before United States District Judge Sam Sparks. Carefully 
nurtured over the course of three years by a group of electronic civil 
rights activists -- at a cost of more than $200,000 -- the case has 
been eagerly anticipated as a possible damper on what is seen as 
computer crime hysteria among federal police.</p>

<p> Plaintiffs hope to prove that the printed word exists just as surely on 
the computer screen as it does on a sheet of paper. The complaint also 
seeks to establish the right of computer users to congregate 
electronically on bulletin board systems -- such as one called 
Illuminati that was taken from Steve Jackson Games -- and to exchange 
private electronic mail on such BBSs.</p>

<p> "This lawsuit is just to stand up and say, at the end of the 20th 
Century, that publishing occurs as much on computers as on the printed 
page," said Jim George, of the Austin firm George, Donaldson & Ford, 
Jackson's law firm.</p>

<p> That issue came into sharp focus during George's questioning of Foley 
regarding the seizure of the PC on which Illuminati ran, and another 
computer on which was stored the word processing document containing a 
pending Steve Jackson Games book release, GURPS Cyberpunk.</p>

<p> "At the Secret Service computer crime school, were you, as the agent in 
charge of this investigation, made aware of special rules for searching 
a publishing company?" George asked Foley. He was referring to the 
Privacy Protection Act, which states that police may not seize a work 
in progress from a publisher. It does not specify what physical form 
such a work must take.</p>

<p> "No, sir, I was not," Foley responded.</p>

<p> "Did you just miss class the day that was taught?" George asked.</p>

<p> "No, sir. The United States Secret Service does not teach its agents 
about special rules regarding search and seizure at publishing 
companies," Foley said.</p>

<p> "Let the record clearly show that to be the case," George said.</p>

<p> Earlier, Foley admitted on the witness stand that his original 
affidavit seeking a judge's approval to raid Steve Jackson Games 
contained a fundamental error.</p>

<p> During the March 1990 raid -- one of several dozen staged that day 
around the country in an investigation that the Secret Service called 
Operation Sun Devil at the time -- agents were seeking copies of a 
document taken as a hacker trophy from Bell South. Subsequently 
republished in an electronic magazine called Phrack, thousands of 
copies of the document were stored on bulletin board systems around the nation.</p>

<p> Neither Jackson nor his company were suspected of wrongdoing, and no 
charges have ever been filed against anyone targeted in several Austin 
raids.  The alleged membership of Steve Jackson employee Loyd 
Blankenship in the Legion of Doom hacker's group -- which was believed 
responsible for the break-in -- led agents to raid the Austin game 
publisher at the same time that Blankenship's Austin home was raided.</p>

<p> Yet the only two paragraphs in the 42-paragraph indictment that 
established a connection between Blankenship's alleged illegal 
activities and Steve Jackson Games were shown to have been erroneously 
arrived at, when George produced a statement by Bellcore expert Henry 
Kluepfel disputing statements attributed to him in Foley's affidavit.</p>

<p> "Is it true that Mr. Kluepfel logged onto (Illuminati)?" George questioned.</p>

<p> "No, sir," Foley responded.</p>

<p> "But you state that in your affidavit," George said.</P>

<p> "That was a misattribution," Foley said.</P>

<p> "So you had no knowledge that anything was sent to my client?"</p>

<p> "No sir, not directly," Foley said.</p>

<p> "Indirectly?" George asked.</p>

<p> "No sir."</p>

<p> The Justice Department, in papers filed with the court, contends that 
only traditional journalistic organizations enjoy the protections of 
the Privacy Protection Act. It further contends that users of 
electronic mail have no reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>

<p> The trial was to resume at 8:30 a.m. It is expected to conclude on 
Thursday or Friday.</p>

<h2>Steve Jackson Games/Secret Service Trial -- Day Two</p>

<p>by Joe Abernathy</p>

<p> AUSTIN -- A young woman read aloud a deeply personal friendship letter 
Wednesday in a federal civil lawsuit intended to establish the human 
dimension and constitutional guarantees of electronic assembly and 
communication.</p>

<p> Testimony indicated that the letter read by Elizabeth Cayce-McCoy 
previously had been seized, printed and reviewed by the Secret Service.</p>

<p> Her correspondence was among 162 undelivered personal letters testimony 
indicated were taken by the government in March 1990 during a raid on 
Steve Jackson Games, which ran an electronic bulletin board system as a 
service to its customers.</p>

<p> Attorneys for the Austin game publisher contend that the seizure of the 
bulletin board represents a violation of the Electronic Communications 
Privacy Act, which is based on Fourth Amendment protections against 
unreasonable search and seizure.</p>

<p> "Because you bring such joy to my friend Walter's life, and also 
because I liked you when I met you, though I wish I could have seen 
your lovely face a little more, I'll send you an autographed copy of 
Bestiary," said McCoy, reading in part from a letter penned by Steffan 
O'Sullivan, the author of the GURPS Bestiary, a fantasy treatise on 
mythical creatures large and small.</p>

<p> Although the correspondence entered the public record upon McCoy's 
reading, the Chronicle obtained explicit permission from the principles 
before excerpting from it.</p>

<p> The electronic mail was contained on the game publisher's public 
bulletin board system, Illuminati, which allowed game-players, authors 
and others to exchange public and personal documents. After agents 
seized the BBS during a raid staged as part of a nationwide crackdown 
on computer crime, Secret Service analysts reviewed, printed and 
deleted the 162 pieces of undelivered mail, testimony indicated.</p>

<p> When the BBS computer was returned to its owner several months later, a 
computer expert was able to resurrect many of the deleted 
communications, including McCoy's friendship letter.</p>

<p> "I never thought anyone would read my mail," she testified. "I was very 
shocked and embarrassed.</p>

<p> "When I told my father that the Secret Service had taken the Steve 
Jackson bulletin board for some reason, he became very upset. He 
thought that I had been linked to some computer crime investigation, 
and that now our computers would be taken."</p>

<p> O'Sullivan, who is a free-lance game writer employed by Steve Jackson, 
followed McCoy to the stand, where he testified that agents intercepted 
-- via the Illuminati seizure -- a critical piece of electronic mail 
seeking to establish when a quarterly royalty check would arrive.</p>

<p> "That letter never arrived, and I had to borrow money to pay the rent," 
he said.</p>

<p> No charges were ever filed in connection with the raid on Steve Jackson 
Games or the simultaneous raid of the Austin home of Jackson employee 
Loyd Blankenship, whose reputed membership in the Legion of Doom 
hackers' group triggered the raids.</p>

<p> Plaintiffs contend that the government's search-and-seizure policies 
have cast a chill over a constitutionally protected form of public 
assembly carried out on bulletin boards, which serve as community 
centers often used by hundreds of people. More than 300 people were 
denied use of Jackson's bulletin board, called Illuminati, for several 
months after the raid, and documents filed with the court claim that a 
broader, continuing chill has been cast over the online community at large.</p>

<p> The lawsuit against the Secret Service seeks to establish that the 
Electronic Communications Privacy Act guarantees the privacy of 
electronic mail.  If U.S. District Court Judge Sam Sparks accepts this 
contention, it would become necessary for the government to obtain 
warrants for each caller to a bulletin board before seizing it.</p>

<p> The Justice Department contends that users of electronic mail do not 
have a reasonable expectation to privacy, because they are voluntarily 
"disclosing" their mail to a third party -- the owner of the bulletin 
board system.</p>

<p> "We weren't going to intercept electronic mail. We were going to access 
stored information," said William J. Cook, a former assistant U.S. 
Attorney in Chicago who wrote the affidavit for the search warrant used 
in the Steve Jackson raid.</p>

<p> The Justice Department attorneys did not substantially challenge 
testimony by any of the several witnesses who were denied use of 
Illuminati.  They did, however, seek to prevent those witnesses from 
testifying -- by conceding their interests -- after Cayce's compelling 
appearance led off the series of witnesses.</p>

<p> Most of the Justice Department's energies were directed toward 
countering damage claims made by Steve Jackson, whose testimony opened 
the second day of the trial. Most of the day's testimony was devoted to 
a complex give-and-take on accounting issues. Some $2 million is being 
sought in damages.</p>

<p> Justice sought to counter the widely repeated assertion that Steve 
Jackson Games was nearly put out of business by the raid by showing 
that the company was already struggling financially when the raid was 
conducted.  An accountant called by the plaintiffs countered that all 
of Jackson's financial problems had been corrected by a reorganization 
in late 1989.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Steve Jackson Games - Day 3, Steve Jackson Games/Secret Service Wrapup</h2>

<p>by Joe Abernathy</p>

<p> AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret Service 
closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal District Judge Sam 
Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a proper investigation in a 
notorious computer crime crackdown, and went too far in retaining 
custody of seized equipment.</p>

<p> The judge's formal findings in the complex case, which will likely set 
new legal precedents, won't be returned until later.</p>

<p> A packed courtroom sat on the edge of the seat Thursday morning as 
Sparks subjected the Secret Service agent in charge of the 
investigation to a grueling dressing-down.</p>

<p> The judge's rebuke apparently convinced the Department of Justice to 
close its defense after calling only that one of the several government 
witnesses on hand. Attorney Mark Battan entered subdued testimony 
seeking to limit the award of monetary damages.</p>

<p> Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in 
charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1, 1990, 
that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke over the 
Service's poor investigation and abusive computer seizure policies. 
While the Service has seized dozens of computers since the crackdown 
began in 1990, this is the first case to challenge the practice.</p>

<p> "The Secret Service didn't do a good job in this case. We know no 
investigation took place. Nobody ever gave any concern as to whether 
(legal) statutes were involved. We know there was damage," Sparks said 
in weighing damages.</p>

<p> The lawsuit, brought by Steve Jackson Games of Austin, said that the 
seizure of three computers violated the Privacy Protection Act, which 
provides First Amendment protections against seizing a publisher's 
works in progress. The lawsuit further said that since one of the com 
uters was being used to run a bulletin board system containing private 
electronic mail, the seizure violated the Electronic Communications 
Privacy Act in regards to the 388 callers of the Illuminati BBS.</p>

<p> Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin 
science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never suspected of 
a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal research to establish 
a criminal connection between the firm and the suspected illegal 
activities of an employee, or to determine that the company was a 
publisher. Indeed, agents testified that they were not even trained in 
the Privacy Protection Act at the special Secret Service school on 
computer crime.</p>

<p> "How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what Steve 
Jackson Games did, what it was?" asked Sparks. "An hour?</p>

<p> "Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to Steve 
Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything taken?</p>

<p> "Did you read the article in <cite>Business Week</cite> magazine</p>
where it had a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying
citizen -- saying he was a computer crime suspect?</p>

<p> "Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material could 
harm Steve Jackson economically?"</p>

<p> Foley replied, "No, sir," but the judge offered his own answer.</p>

<p> "You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go out 
and hire a lawyer and sue you."</p>

<p> More than $200,000 has been spent by the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/E/EFF.html">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>
in bringing the case to trial. The EFF was founded by <a
href="/revolution/by_name/K/MitchKapor.html">Mitchell Kapor</a>
amid a civil liberties movement sparked in large part by the Secret 
Service computer crime crackdown.</p>

<p> "The dressing-down of the Secret Service for their behavior is a major 
vindication of what we've been saying all along, which is that there 
were outrageous actions taken against Steve Jackson that hurt his 
business and sent a chilling effect to everyone using bulletin boards, 
and that there were larger principles at stake," said Kapor, contacted 
at his Cambridge, Mass., office.</p>

<p> "We're very happy with the way the case came out," said Shari Steele, 
who attended the case as counsel for the EFF. "That session with the 
judge and Tim Foley is what a lawyer dreams about."</p>

<p> That session seemed triggered by a riveting cross-examination of Foley 
by Pete Kennedy, Jackson's attorney.</p>

<p> Kennedy forced Foley to admit that the search warrant did not meet even 
the Service's own standards for a search-and-seizure, and did not 
establish that Jackson Games was suspected of being involved in any 
illegal activity.</p>

<p> "Agent Foley, it's been almost three years. Has Chris Goggans been 
indicted? Has Loyd Blankenship been indicted? Has Loyd Blankenship's 
computer been returned to him?"</p>

<p> The purported membership of Jackson Games employee Blankenship in the 
Legion of Doom hacker's group triggered the raids that day on Jackson 
Games, Blankenship's home, and that of Goggans, a Houstonian who at the 
time was a University of Texas student. No charges have been filed, 
although the computer seized from Blankenship's home -- containing his 
wife's dissertation -- never has been returned.</p>

<p> After the cross-examination, Sparks questioned Foley on a number of key 
details before and after the raid, focusing on the holes in the search 
warrant, why Jackson was not allowed to copy his work in progress after 
it was seized, and why his computers were not returned after the Secret 
Service analyzed them, a process completed before the end of March.</p>

<p> "The examination took seven days, but you didn't give Steve Jackson's 
computers back for three months. Why?" asked an incredulous Sparks. "So 
here you are, with three computers, 300 floppy disks, an owner who was 
asking for it back, his attorney calling you, and what I want to know 
is why copies of everything couldn't be given back in days. Not months.
Days.</p>

<p> "That's what makes you mad about this case."</p>

<p> The Justice Department contended that Jackson Games is a manufacturer, 
and that only journalistic organizations can call upon the Privacy 
Protection Act. It contended that the ECPA was not violated because 
electronic mail is not "intercepted" when a BBS is seized. This 
argument rests on a narrow definition of interception.</p>

<h1>Steve Jackson and the Libertarian Party</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/JayManifold.html">Jay Manifold</a> of
the Libertarian Party of Texas:</p>

<p>This afternoon I spoke with <a
href="/revolution/by_name/J/SteveJackson.html">Steve Jackson</a>,
proprietor of Steve Jackson
Games in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Austin.html">Austin</a>
and plaintiff of a successful lawsuit against the Secret
Service earlier this year.  Mr Jackson's business was ransacked by
Treasury Department goons during the infamous "Hacker Crackdown" of 
1990.  He was already well-known in the "gaming community" and became
familiar to computer users nationwide after this incident.  The trial
was covered in the mainstream press, and the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation assisted in his defense.  He won $50,000 in damages, and each
employee whose private e-mail was read by the Feds after the raid was
awarded $1,000.  For more information about his case, you may wish to
read Bruce Sterling's <cite>The Hacker Crackdown</cite> or almost any recent
issue of <cite>2600</cite> magazine.</p>

<p>Steve, like most of his employees, is a Libertarian. He identifies with us
strongly. Steve offered to assist us with publications, which is his area of
expertise: the games his company publishes involve lengthy hard-copy texts of
rules and scenarios.  His availability is limited, but for certain
one-time-only efforts his assistance may prove invaluable.</p>

<p>One sobering point: in the e-mail message I sent to Steve on Friday to
let him know I'd be calling, I stated: "I believe that your recent
experiences have entailed some of the most egregious violations of
Consitutional rights ever suffered by Texans."  On the phone today, 
Steve said he doesn't agree --- because he's still alive, and they 
didn't burn the place down.</p>

              conditions of agreements to fulfill the duties described in
              paragraphs (1) through (5) of subsection (b) and this

                `(2) INTERCONNECTION- The duty to provide, for the facilities
              and equipment of any requesting telecommunications carrier,
              interconnection with the local exchange carrier's network--

                  exchange service and exchange access;
                    `(B) at any technically feasible point within the
                  carrier's network;
                    `(C) that is at least equal in quality to that provided

                  carrier provides interconnection; and
                    `(D) on rates, terms, and conditions that are just,

                  terms and conditions of the agreement and the requirements
                  of this section and <A href="#S252">section 252</a>.
                `(3) UNBUNDLED ACCESS- The duty to provide, to any requesting
              telecommunications carrier for the provision of a
              telecommunications service, nondiscriminatory access to network

              point on rates, terms, and conditions that are just,
              reasonable, and nondiscriminatory in accordance with the terms
              and conditions of the agreement and the requirements of this
              section and <A href="#S252">section 252</a>. An incumbent local exchange carrier
              shall provide such unbundled network elements in a manner that
              allows requesting carriers to combine such elements in order to
              provide such telecommunications service.
                `(4) RESALE- The duty--
                    `(A) to offer for resale at wholesale rates any
                  telecommunications service that the carrier provides at
                  retail to subscribers who are not telecommunications
                  carriers; and
                    `(B) not to prohibit, and not to impose unreasonable or
                  discriminatory conditions or limitations on, the resale of
                  such telecommunications service, except that a State
                  commission may, consistent with regulations prescribed by
                  the Commission under this section, prohibit a reseller that
                  obtains at wholesale rates a telecommunications service
                  that is available at retail only to a category of
                  subscribers from offering such service to a different
                  category of subscribers.
                `(5) NOTICE OF CHANGES- The duty to provide reasonable public
              notice of changes in the information necessary for the
              transmission and routing of services using that local exchange
              carrier's facilities or networks, as well as of any other
              changes that would affect the interoperability of those
              facilities and networks.
                `(6) COLLOCATION- The duty to provide, on rates, terms, and
              conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory,

              interconnection or access to unbundled network elements at the
              premises of the local exchange carrier, except that the carrier
              may provide for virtual collocation if the local exchange
              carrier demonstrates to the State commission that physical
              collocation is not practical for technical reasons or because
              of space limitations.
            `(d) IMPLEMENTATION-
                `(1) IN GENERAL- Within 6 months after the date of enactment
              of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Commission shall
              complete all actions necessary to establish regulations to
              implement the requirements of this section.
                `(2) ACCESS STANDARDS- In determining what network elements
              should be made available for purposes of subsection (c)(3), the
              Commission shall consider, at a minimum, whether--
                    `(A) access to such network elements as are proprietary
                  in nature is necessary; and
                    `(B) the failure to provide access to such network
                  elements would impair the ability of the telecommunications
                  carrier seeking access to provide the services that it
                  seeks to offer.
                `(3) PRESERVATION OF STATE ACCESS REGULATIONS- In prescribing
              and enforcing regulations to implement the requirements of this
              section, the Commission shall not preclude the enforcement of
              any regulation, order, or policy of a State commission that--
                    `(A) establishes access and interconnection obligations
                  of local exchange carriers;
                    `(B) is consistent with the requirements of this section;
                  and
                    `(C) does not substantially prevent implementation of the
                  requirements of this section and the purposes of this part.
            `(e) NUMBERING ADMINISTRATION-
                `(1) COMMISSION AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION- The Commission
              shall create or designate one or more impartial entities to
              administer telecommunications numbering and to make such
              numbers available on an equitable basis. The Commission shall
              have exclusive jurisdiction over those portions of the North
              American Numbering Plan that pertain to the United States.
              Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Commission from
              delegating to State commissions or other entities all or any
              portion of such jurisdiction.
                `(2)  COSTS- The cost of establishing telecommunications
              numbering administration arrangements and number portability
              shall be borne by all telecommunications carriers on a
              competitively neutral basis as determined by the Commission.
            `(f) EXEMPTIONS, SUSPENSIONS, AND MODIFICATIONS-
                `(1) EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN RURAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES-
                    `(A) EXEMPTION- Subsection (c) of this section shall not
                  apply to a rural telephone company until (i) such company
                  has received a bona fide request for interconnection,
                  services, or network elements, and (ii) the State
                  commission determines (under subparagraph (B)) that such
                  request is not unduly economically burdensome, is
                  technically feasible, and is consistent with section <a href="#S254">254</a>
                  (other than subsections (b)(7) and (c)(1)(D) thereof).
                    `(B) STATE TERMINATION OF EXEMPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION
                  SCHEDULE- The party making a bona fide request of a rural
                  telephone company for interconnection, services, or network
                  elements shall submit a notice of its request to the State
                  commission. The State commission shall conduct an inquiry
                  for the purpose of determining whether to terminate the
                  exemption under subparagraph (A). Within 120 days after the
                  State commission receives notice of the request, the State
                  commission shall terminate the exemption if the request is
                  not unduly economically burdensome, is technically
                  feasible, and is consistent with section <a href="#S254">254</a> (other than
                  subsections (b)(7) and (c)(1)(D) thereof). Upon termination
                  of the exemption, a State commission shall establish an
                  implementation schedule for compliance with the request
                  that is consistent in time and manner with Commission
                  regulations.
                    `(C) LIMITATION ON EXEMPTION- The exemption provided by
                  this paragraph shall not apply with respect to a request
                  under subsection (c) from a cable operator providing video
                  programming, and seeking to provide any telecommunications
                  service, in the area in which the rural telephone company
                  provides video programming. The limitation contained in
                  this subparagraph shall not apply to a rural telephone
                  company that is providing video programming on the date of
                  enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
                `(2) SUSPENSIONS AND MODIFICATIONS FOR RURAL CARRIERS- A
              local exchange carrier with fewer than 2 percent of the
              Nation's subscriber lines installed in the aggregate nationwide
              may petition a State commission for a suspension or
              modification of the application of a requirement or
              requirements of subsection (b) or (c) to telephone exchange
              service facilities specified in such petition. The State
              commission shall grant such petition to the extent that, and
              for such duration as, the State commission determines that such
              suspension or modification--
                    `(A) is necessary--
                        `(i) to avoid a significant adverse economic impact
                      on users of telecommunications services generally;
                        `(ii) to avoid imposing a requirement that is unduly
                      economically burdensome; or
                        `(iii) to avoid imposing a requirement that is
                      technically infeasible; and
                    `(B)  is consistent with the public interest,
                  convenience, and necessity.
              The State commission shall act upon any petition filed under
              this paragraph within 180 days after receiving such petition.
              Pending such action, the State commission may suspend
              enforcement of the requirement or requirements to which the
              petition applies with respect to the petitioning carrier or
              carriers.
            `(g) CONTINUED ENFORCEMENT OF EXCHANGE ACCESS AND INTERCONNECTION
          REQUIREMENTS- On and after the date of enactment of the
          Telecommunications Act of 1996, each local exchange carrier, to the
          extent that it provides wireline services, shall provide exchange
          access, information access, and exchange services for such access
          to interexchange carriers and information service providers in
          accordance with the same equal access and nondiscriminatory
          interconnection restrictions and obligations (including receipt of
          compensation) that apply to such carrier on the date immediately
          preceding the date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of
          1996 under any court order, consent decree, or regulation, order,
          or policy of the Commission, until such restrictions and
          obligations are explicitly superseded by regulations prescribed by
          the Commission after such date of enactment. During the period
          beginning on such date of enactment and until such restrictions and
          obligations are so superseded, such restrictions and obligations
          shall be enforceable in the same manner as regulations of the
          Commission.
            `(h) DEFINITION OF INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIER-
                `(1) DEFINITION- For purposes of this section, the term
              `incumbent local exchange carrier' means, with respect to an
              area, the local exchange carrier that--
                    `(A) on the date of enactment of the Telecommunications
                  Act of 1996, provided telephone exchange service in such
                  area; and
                    `(B)(i) on such date of enactment, was deemed to be a
                  member of the exchange carrier association pursuant to
                  section 69.601(b) of the Commission's regulations (47
                  C.F.R. 69.601(b)); or
                    `(ii) is a person or entity that, on or after such date
                  of enactment, became a successor or assign of a member
                  described in clause (i).
                `(2) TREATMENT OF COMPARABLE CARRIERS AS INCUMBENTS- The
              Commission may, by rule, provide for the treatment of a local
              exchange carrier (or class or category thereof) as an incumbent
              local exchange carrier for purposes of this section if--
                    `(A) such carrier occupies a position in the market for
                  telephone exchange service within an area that is
                  comparable to the position occupied by a carrier described
                  in paragraph (1);
                    `(B) such carrier has substantially replaced an incumbent
                  local exchange carrier described in paragraph (1); and
                    `(C) such treatment is consistent with the public
                  interest, convenience, and necessity and the purposes of
                  this section.
            `(i) SAVINGS PROVISION- Nothing in this section shall be
          construed to limit or otherwise affect the Commission's authority
          under section <a href="#S201">201</a>.

<h4>`<a name="S252">SEC. 252.</a> PROCEDURES FOR NEGOTIATION,
          	ARBITRATION, AND APPROVAL OF AGREEMENTS.</h4>

<pre>
            `(a) AGREEMENTS ARRIVED AT THROUGH NEGOTIATION-
                `(1) VOLUNTARY NEGOTIATIONS- Upon receiving a request for
              interconnection, services, or network elements pursuant to
              section <a href="#S251">251</a>, an incumbent local exchange carrier may negotiate
              and enter into a binding agreement with the requesting
              telecommunications carrier or carriers without regard to the
              standards set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of section <a href="#S251">251</a>.
              The agreement shall include a detailed schedule of itemized
              charges for interconnection and each service or network element
              included in the agreement. The agreement, including any
              interconnection agreement negotiated before the date of
              enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, shall be
              submitted to the State commission under subsection (e) of this
              section.
                `(2) MEDIATION- Any party negotiating an agreement under this
              section may, at any point in the negotiation, ask a State
              commission to participate in the negotiation and to mediate any
              differences arising in the course of the negotiation.
            `(b) AGREEMENTS ARRIVED AT THROUGH COMPULSORY ARBITRATION-
                `(1) ARBITRATION- During the period from the 135th to the
              160th day (inclusive) after the date on which an incumbent
              local exchange carrier receives a request for negotiation under
              this section, the carrier or any other party to the negotiation
              may petition a State commission to arbitrate any open issues.
                `(2) DUTY OF PETITIONER-
                    `(A) A party that petitions a State commission under
                  paragraph (1) shall, at the same time as it submits the
                  petition, provide the State commission all relevant
                  documentation concerning--
                        `(i) the unresolved issues;
                        `(ii) the position of each of the parties with
                      respect to those issues; and
                        `(iii) any other issue discussed and resolved by the
                      parties.
                    `(B) A party petitioning a State commission under
                  paragraph (1) shall provide a copy of the petition and any
                  documentation to the other party or parties not later than
                  the day on which the State commission receives the petition.
                `(3) OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND- A non-petitioning party to a
              negotiation under this section may respond to the other party's
              petition and provide such additional information as it wishes
              within 25 days after the State commission receives the petition.
                `(4) ACTION BY STATE COMMISSION-
                    `(A) The State commission shall limit its consideration
                  of any petition under paragraph (1) (and any response
                  thereto) to the issues set forth in the petition and in the
                  response, if any, filed under paragraph (3).
                    `(B) The State commission may require the petitioning
                  party and the responding party to provide such information
                  as may be necessary for the State commission to reach a
                  decision on the unresolved issues. If any party refuses or
                  fails unreasonably to respond on a timely basis to any
                  reasonable request from the State commission, then the
                  State commission may proceed on the basis of the best
                  information available to it from whatever source derived.
                    `(C) The State commission shall resolve each issue set
                  forth in the petition and the response, if any, by imposing
                  appropriate conditions as required to implement subsection
                  (c) upon the parties to the agreement, and shall conclude
                  the resolution of any unresolved issues not later than 9
                  months after the date on which the local exchange carrier
                  received the request under this section.
                `(5) REFUSAL TO NEGOTIATE- The refusal of any other party to
              the negotiation to participate further in the negotiations, to
              cooperate with the State commission in carrying out its
              function as an arbitrator, or to continue to negotiate in good
              faith in the presence, or with the assistance, of the State
              commission shall be considered a failure to negotiate in good
              faith.
            `(c) STANDARDS FOR ARBITRATION- In resolving by arbitration under
          subsection (b) any open issues and imposing conditions upon the
          parties to the agreement, a State commission shall--
                `(1) ensure that such resolution and conditions meet the
              requirements of section <a href="#S251">251</a>, including the regulations
              prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section <a href="#S251">251</a>;
                `(2) establish any rates for interconnection, services, or
              network elements according to subsection (d); and
                `(3) provide a schedule for implementation of the terms and
              conditions by the parties to the agreement.
            `(d) PRICING STANDARDS-
                `(1) INTERCONNECTION AND NETWORK ELEMENT CHARGES-
              Determinations by a State commission of the just and reasonable
              rate for the interconnection of facilities and equipment for
              purposes of subsection (c)(2) of section <a href="#S251">251</a>, and the just and
              reasonable rate for network elements for purposes of subsection
              (c)(3) of such section--
                    `(A) shall be--
                        `(i) based on the cost (determined without reference
                      to a rate-of-return or other rate-based proceeding) of
                      providing the interconnection or network element
                      (whichever is applicable), and
                        `(ii) nondiscriminatory, and
                    `(B) may include a reasonable profit.
                `(2) CHARGES FOR TRANSPORT AND TERMINATION OF TRAFFIC-
                    `(A) IN GENERAL- For the purposes of compliance by an
                  incumbent local exchange carrier with section <a href="#S251">251</a>(b)(5), a
                  State commission shall not consider the terms and
                  conditions for reciprocal compensation to be just and
                  reasonable unless--
                        `(i) such terms and conditions provide for the mutual
                      and reciprocal recovery by each carrier of costs
                      associated with the transport and termination on each
                      carrier's network facilities of calls that originate on
                      the network facilities of the other carrier; and
                        `(ii) such terms and conditions determine such costs
                      on the basis of a reasonable approximation of the
                      additional costs of terminating such calls.
                    `(B) RULES OF CONSTRUCTION- This paragraph shall not be
                  construed--
                        `(i) to preclude arrangements that afford the mutual
                      recovery of costs through the offsetting of reciprocal
                      obligations, including arrangements that waive mutual
                      recovery (such as bill-and-keep arrangements); or
                        `(ii) to authorize the Commission or any State
                      commission to engage in any rate regulation proceeding
                      to establish with particularity the additional costs of
                      transporting or terminating calls, or to require
                      carriers to maintain records with respect to the
                      additional costs of such calls.
                `(3) WHOLESALE PRICES FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES- For
              the purposes of section <a href="#S251">251</a>(c)(4), a State commission shall
              determine wholesale rates on the basis of retail rates charged
              to subscribers for the telecommunications service requested,
              excluding the portion thereof attributable to any marketing,
              billing, collection, and other costs that will be avoided by
              the local exchange carrier.
            `(e) APPROVAL BY STATE COMMISSION-
                `(1) APPROVAL REQUIRED- Any interconnection agreement adopted
              by negotiation or arbitration shall be submitted for approval
              to the State commission. A State commission to which an
              agreement is submitted shall approve or reject the agreement,
              with written findings as to any deficiencies.
                `(2) GROUNDS FOR REJECTION- The State commission may only
              reject--
                    `(A) an agreement (or any portion thereof) adopted by
                  negotiation under subsection (a) if it finds that--
                        `(i) the agreement (or portion thereof) discriminates
                      against a telecommunications carrier not a party to the
                      agreement; or
                        `(ii) the implementation of such agreement or portion
                      is not consistent with the public interest,
                      convenience, and necessity; or
                    `(B) an agreement (or any portion thereof) adopted by
                  arbitration under subsection (b) if it finds that the
                  agreement does not meet the requirements of section <a href="#S251">251</a>,
                  including the regulations prescribed by the Commission
                  pursuant to section <a href="#S251">251</a>, or the standards set forth in
                  subsection (d) of this section.
                `(3) PRESERVATION OF AUTHORITY- Notwithstanding paragraph
              (2), but subject to section <a href="#S253">253</a>, nothing in this section shall
              prohibit a State commission from establishing or enforcing
              other requirements of State law in its review of an agreement,
              including requiring compliance with intrastate
              telecommunications service quality standards or requirements.
                `(4) SCHEDULE FOR DECISION- If the State commission does not
              act to approve or reject the agreement within 90 days after
              submission by the parties of an agreement adopted by
              negotiation under subsection (a), or within 30 days after
              submission by the parties of an agreement adopted by
              arbitration under subsection (b), the agreement shall be deemed
              approved.  No State court shall have jurisdiction to review the
              action of a State commission in approving or rejecting an
              agreement under this section.
                `(5) COMMISSION TO ACT IF STATE WILL NOT ACT- If a State
              commission fails to act to carry out its responsibility under
              this section in any proceeding or other matter under this
              section, then the Commission shall issue an order preempting
              the State commission's jurisdiction of that proceeding or
              matter within 90 days after being notified (or taking notice)
              of such failure, and shall assume the responsibility of the
              State commission under this section with respect to the
              proceeding or matter and act for the State commission.
                `(6) REVIEW OF STATE COMMISSION ACTIONS- In a case in which a
              State fails to act as described in paragraph (5), the
              proceeding by the Commission under such paragraph and any
              judicial review of the Commission's actions shall be the
              exclusive remedies for a State commission's failure to act. In
              any case in which a State commission makes a determination
              under this section, any party aggrieved by such determination
              may bring an action in an appropriate Federal district court to
              determine whether the agreement or statement meets the
              requirements of section <a href="#S251">251</a> and this section.
            `(f) STATEMENTS OF GENERALLY AVAILABLE TERMS-
                `(1) IN GENERAL- A Bell operating company may prepare and
              file with a State commission a statement of the terms and
              conditions that such company generally offers within that State
              to comply with the requirements of section <a href="#S251">251</a> and the
              regulations thereunder and the standards applicable under this
              section.
                `(2) STATE COMMISSION REVIEW- A State commission may not
              approve such statement unless such statement complies with
              subsection (d) of this section and section <a href="#S251">251</a> and the
              regulations thereunder. Except as provided in section <a href="#S253">253</a>,
              nothing in this section shall prohibit a State commission from
              establishing or enforcing other requirements of State law in
              its review of such statement, including requiring compliance
              with intrastate telecommunications service quality standards or
              requirements.
                `(3) SCHEDULE FOR REVIEW- The State commission to which a
              statement is submitted shall, not later than 60 days after the
              date of such submission--
                    `(A) complete the review of such statement under
                  paragraph (2) (including any reconsideration thereof),
                  unless the submitting carrier agrees to an extension of the
                  period for such review; or
                    `(B) permit such statement to take effect.
                `(4) AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE REVIEW- Paragraph (3) shall not
              preclude the State commission from continuing to review a
              statement that has been permitted to take effect under
              subparagraph (B) of such paragraph or from approving or
              disapproving such statement under paragraph (2).
                `(5) DUTY TO NEGOTIATE NOT AFFECTED- The submission or
              approval of a statement under this subsection shall not relieve
              a Bell operating company of its duty to negotiate the terms and
              conditions of an agreement under section <a href="#S251">251</a>.
            `(g) CONSOLIDATION OF STATE PROCEEDINGS- Where not inconsistent
          with the requirements of this Act, a State commission may, to the
          extent practical, consolidate proceedings under sections 214(e),
          <a href="#S251">251</a>(f), <a href="#S253">253</a>, and this section in order to reduce administrative
          burdens on telecommunications carriers, other parties to the
          proceedings, and the State commission in carrying out its
          responsibilities under this Act.
            `(h) FILING REQUIRED- A State commission shall make a copy of
          each agreement approved under subsection (e) and each statement
          approved under subsection (f) available for public inspection and
          copying within 10 days after the agreement or statement is
          approved. The State commission may charge a reasonable and
          nondiscriminatory fee to the parties to the agreement or to the
          party filing the statement to cover the costs of approving and
          filing such agreement or statement.
            `(i) AVAILABILITY TO OTHER TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS- A local
          exchange carrier shall make available any interconnection, service,
          or network element provided under an agreement approved under this
          section to which it is a party to any other requesting
          telecommunications carrier upon the same terms and conditions as
          those provided in the agreement.
            `(j) DEFINITION OF INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIER- For purposes
          of this section, the term `incumbent local exchange carrier' has
          the meaning provided in section <a href="#S251">251</a>(h).

<pre>
            `(a) IN GENERAL- No State or local statute or regulation, or
          other State or local legal requirement, may prohibit or have the

          interstate or intrastate telecommunications service.
            `(b) STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITY- Nothing in this section shall
          affect the ability of a State to impose, on a competitively neutral
          basis and consistent with section <a href="#S254">254</a>, requirements necessary to
          preserve and advance universal service, protect the public safety
          and welfare, ensure the continued quality of telecommunications
          services, and safeguard the rights of consumers.

          compensation from telecommunications providers, on a competitively
          neutral and nondiscriminatory basis, for use of public
          rights-of-way on a nondiscriminatory basis, if the compensation
          required is publicly disclosed by such government.
            `(d) PREEMPTION- If, after notice and an opportunity for public
          comment, the Commission determines that a State or local government
          has permitted or imposed any statute, regulation, or legal
          requirement that violates subsection (a) or (b), the Commission
          shall preempt the enforcement of such statute, regulation, or legal
          requirement to the extent necessary to correct such violation or
          inconsistency.
            `(e) COMMERCIAL MOBILE SERVICE PROVIDERS- Nothing in this section
          shall affect the application of section 332(c)(3) to commercial
          mobile service providers.
            `(f) RURAL MARKETS- It shall not be a violation of this section
          for a State to require a telecommunications carrier that seeks to
          provide telephone exchange service or exchange access in a service
          area served by a rural telephone company to meet the requirements
          in section 214(e)(1) for designation as an eligible
          telecommunications carrier for that area before being permitted to
          provide such service. This subsection shall not apply--
                `(1) to a service area served by a rural telephone company
              that has obtained an exemption, suspension, or modification of
              section <a href="#S251">251</a>(c)(4) that effectively prevents a competitor from
              meeting the requirements of section 214(e)(1); and
                `(2) to a provider of commercial mobile services.

<pre>
            `(a) PROCEDURES TO REVIEW UNIVERSAL SERVICE REQUIREMENTS-
                `(1) FEDERAL-STATE JOINT BOARD ON UNIVERSAL SERVICE- Within
              one month after the date of enactment of the Telecommunications
              Act of 1996, the Commission shall institute and refer to a
              Federal-State Joint Board under section 410(c) a proceeding to
              recommend changes to any of its regulations in order to
              implement sections 214(e) and this section, including the
              definition of the services that are supported by Federal
              universal service support mechanisms and a specific timetable
              for completion of such recommendations. In addition to the
              members of the Joint Board required under section 410(c), one
              member of such Joint Board shall be a State-appointed utility
              consumer advocate nominated by a national organization of State
              utility consumer advocates. The Joint Board shall, after notice
              and opportunity for public comment, make its recommendations to
              the Commission 9 months after the date of enactment of the
              Telecommunications Act of 1996.
                `(2) COMMISSION ACTION- The Commission shall initiate a
              single proceeding to implement the recommendations from the
              Joint Board required by paragraph (1) and shall complete such
              proceeding within 15 months after the date of enactment of the
              Telecommunications Act of 1996. The rules established by such
              proceeding shall include a definition of the services that are
              supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms and a
              specific timetable for implementation. Thereafter, the
              Commission shall complete any proceeding to implement
              subsequent recommendations from any Joint Board on universal
              service within one year after receiving such recommendations.
            `(b) UNIVERSAL SERVICE PRINCIPLES- The Joint Board and the
          Commission shall base policies for the preservation and advancement
          of universal service on the following principles:
                `(1) QUALITY AND RATES- Quality services should be available
              at just, reasonable, and affordable rates.
                `(2) ACCESS TO ADVANCED SERVICES- Access to advanced
              telecommunications and information services should be provided
              in all regions of the Nation.
                `(3) ACCESS IN RURAL AND HIGH COST AREAS- Consumers in all
              regions of the Nation, including low-income consumers and those
              in rural, insular, and high cost areas, should have access to
              telecommunications and information services, including
              interexchange services and advanced telecommunications and
              information services, that are reasonably comparable to those
              services provided in urban areas and that are available at
              rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for
              similar services in urban areas.
                `(4) EQUITABLE AND NONDISCRIMINATORY CONTRIBUTIONS- All
              providers of telecommunications services should make an
              equitable and nondiscriminatory contribution to the
              preservation and advancement of universal service.
                `(5) SPECIFIC AND PREDICTABLE SUPPORT MECHANISMS- There
              should be specific, predictable and sufficient Federal and
              State mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.
                `(6) ACCESS TO ADVANCED TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES FOR
              SCHOOLS, HEALTH CARE, AND LIBRARIES- Elementary and secondary
              schools and classrooms, health care providers, and libraries
              should have access to advanced telecommunications services as
              described in subsection (h).
                `(7) ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES- Such other principles as the
              Joint Board and the Commission determine are necessary and
              appropriate for the protection of the public interest,
              convenience, and necessity and are consistent with this Act.
            `(c) DEFINITION-
                `(1) IN GENERAL- Universal service is an evolving level of
              telecommunications services that the Commission shall establish
              periodically under this section, taking into account advances
              in telecommunications and information technologies and
              services. The Joint Board in recommending, and the Commission
              in establishing, the definition of the services that are
              supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms shall
              consider the extent to which such telecommunications services--
                    `(A) are essential to education, public health, or public
                  safety;
                    `(B) have, through the operation of market choices by
                  customers, been subscribed to by a substantial majority of
                  residential customers;
                    `(C) are being deployed in public telecommunications
                  networks by telecommunications carriers; and
                    `(D) are consistent with the public interest,
                  convenience, and necessity.
                `(2) ALTERATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS- The Joint Board may, from
              time to time, recommend to the Commission modifications in the
              definition of the services that are supported by Federal
              universal service support mechanisms.
                `(3) SPECIAL SERVICES- In addition to the services included
              in the definition of universal service under paragraph (1), the
              Commission may designate additional services for such support
              mechanisms for schools, libraries, and health care providers
              for the purposes of subsection (h).
            `(d) TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIER CONTRIBUTION- Every
          telecommunications carrier that provides interstate
          telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and
          nondiscriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, and
          sufficient mechanisms established by the Commission to preserve and
          advance universal service. The Commission may exempt a carrier or
          class of carriers from this requirement if the carrier's
          telecommunications activities are limited to such an extent that
          the level of such carrier's contribution to the preservation and
          advancement of universal service would be de minimis.  Any other
          provider of interstate telecommunications may be required to
          contribute to the preservation and advancement of universal service
          if the public interest so requires.
            `(e) UNIVERSAL SERVICE SUPPORT- After the date on which
          Commission regulations implementing this section take effect, only
          an eligible telecommunications carrier designated under section
          214(e) shall be eligible to receive specific Federal universal
          service support. A carrier that receives such support shall use
          that support only for the provision, maintenance, and upgrading of
          facilities and services for which the support is intended.  Any
          such support should be explicit and sufficient to achieve the
          purposes of this section.
            `(f) STATE AUTHORITY- A State may adopt regulations not
          inconsistent with the Commission's rules to preserve and advance
          universal service. Every telecommunications carrier that provides
          intrastate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an
          equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, in a manner determined by
          the State to the preservation and advancement of universal service
          in that State.  A State may adopt regulations to provide for
          additional definitions and standards to preserve and advance
          universal service within that State only to the extent that such
          regulations adopt additional specific, predictable, and sufficient
          mechanisms to support such definitions or standards that do not
          rely on or burden Federal universal service support mechanisms.
            `(g) INTEREXCHANGE AND INTERSTATE SERVICES- Within 6 months after
          the date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the
          Commission shall adopt rules to require that the rates charged by
          providers of interexchange telecommunications services to
          subscribers in rural and high cost areas shall be no higher than
          the rates charged by each such provider to its subscribers in urban
          areas. Such rules shall also require that a provider of interstate
          interexchange telecommunications services shall provide such
          services to its subscribers in each State at rates no higher than
          the rates charged to its subscribers in any other State.
            `(h) TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES FOR CERTAIN PROVIDERS-
                `(1) IN GENERAL-
                    `(A) HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FOR RURAL AREAS- A
                  telecommunications carrier shall, upon receiving a bona
                  fide request, provide telecommunications services which are
                  necessary for the provision of health care services in a
                  State, including instruction relating to such services, to
                  any public or nonprofit health care provider that serves
                  persons who reside in rural areas in that State at rates
                  that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar
                  services in urban areas in that State. A telecommunications
                  carrier providing service under this paragraph shall be
                  entitled to have an amount equal to the difference, if any,
                  between the rates for services provided to health care
                  providers for rural areas in a State and the rates for
                  similar services provided to other customers in comparable
                  rural areas in that State treated as a service obligation
                  as a part of its obligation to participate in the
                  mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.
                    `(B) EDUCATIONAL PROVIDERS AND LIBRARIES- All
                  telecommunications carriers serving a geographic area
                  shall, upon a bona fide request for any of its services
                  that are within the definition of universal service under
                  subsection (c)(3), provide such services to elementary
                  schools, secondary schools, and libraries for educational
                  purposes at rates less than the amounts charged for similar
                  services to other parties. The discount shall be an amount
                  that the Commission, with respect to interstate services,
                  and the States, with respect to intrastate services,
                  determine is appropriate and necessary to ensure affordable
                  access to and use of such services by such entities. A
                  telecommunications carrier providing service under this
                  paragraph shall--
                        `(i) have an amount equal to the amount of the
                      discount treated as an offset to its obligation to
                      contribute to the mechanisms to preserve and advance
                      universal service, or
                        `(ii) notwithstanding the provisions of subsection
                      (e) of this section, receive reimbursement utilizing
                      the support mechanisms to preserve and advance
                      universal service.
                `(2) ADVANCED SERVICES- The Commission shall establish
              competitively neutral rules--
                    `(A) to enhance, to the extent technically feasible and
                  economically reasonable, access to advanced
                  telecommunications and information services for all public
                  and nonprofit elementary and secondary school classrooms,
                  health care providers, and libraries; and
                    `(B) to define the circumstances under which a
                  telecommunications carrier may be required to connect its
                  network to such public institutional telecommunications
                  users.
                `(3) TERMS AND CONDITIONS- Telecommunications services and
              network capacity provided to a public institutional
              telecommunications user under this subsection may not be sold,
              resold, or otherwise transferred by such user in consideration
              for money or any other thing of value.
                `(4) ELIGIBILITY OF USERS- No entity listed in this
              subsection shall be entitled to preferential rates or treatment
              as required by this subsection, if such entity operates as a
              for-profit business, is a school described in paragraph (5)(A)
              with an endowment of more than $50,000,000, or is a library not
              eligible for participation in State-based plans for funds under
              title III of the Library Services and Construction Act (20
              U.S.C. 335c et seq.).

<h3><a name="S102">SEC. 102.</a> ELIGIBLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS.</h3>

<pre>
            (a) IN GENERAL- Section 214 (47 U.S.C. 214) is amended by adding
          at the end thereof the following new subsection:
            `(e) PROVISION OF UNIVERSAL SERVICE-
                `(1) ELIGIBLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS- A common carrier
              designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier under
              paragraph (2) or (3) shall be eligible to receive universal
              service support in accordance with section <a href="#S254">254</a> and shall,
              throughout the service area for which the designation is
              received--
                    `(A) offer the services that are supported by Federal
                  universal service support mechanisms under section <a href="#S254">254</a>(c),
                  either using its own facilities or a combination of its own
                  facilities and resale of another carrier's services
                  (including the services offered by another eligible
                  telecommunications carrier); and
                    `(B) advertise the availability of such services and the
                  charges therefor using media of general distribution.
                `(2) DESIGNATION OF ELIGIBLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS- A
              State commission shall upon its own motion or upon request
              designate a common carrier that meets the requirements of
              paragraph (1) as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a
              service area designated by the State commission. Upon request
              and consistent with the public interest, convenience, and
              necessity, the State commission may, in the case of an area
              served by a rural telephone company, and shall, in the case of
              all other areas, designate more than one common carrier as an
              eligible telecommunications carrier for a service area
              designated by the State commission, so long as each additional
              requesting carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (1).
              Before designating an additional eligible telecommunications
              carrier for an area served by a rural telephone company, the
              State commission shall find that the designation is in the
              public interest.
                `(3) DESIGNATION OF ELIGIBLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS FOR
              UNSERVED AREAS- If no common carrier will provide the services
              that are supported by Federal universal service support
              mechanisms under section <a href="#S254">254</a>(c) to an unserved community or any
              portion thereof that requests such service, the Commission,
              with respect to interstate services, or a State commission,
              with respect to intrastate services, shall determine which
              common carrier or carriers are best able to provide such
              service to the requesting unserved community or portion thereof
              and shall order such carrier or carriers to provide such
              service for that unserved community or portion thereof. Any
              carrier or carriers ordered to provide such service under this
              paragraph shall meet the requirements of paragraph (1) and
              shall be designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier
              for that community or portion thereof.
                `(4) RELINQUISHMENT OF UNIVERSAL SERVICE- A State commission
              shall permit an eligible telecommunications carrier to
              relinquish its designation as such a carrier in any area served
              by more than one eligible telecommunications carrier. An
              eligible telecommunications carrier that seeks to relinquish
              its eligible telecommunications carrier designation for an area
              served by more than one eligible telecommunications carrier
              shall give advance notice to the State commission of such
              relinquishment. Prior to permitting a telecommunications
              carrier designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier to
              cease providing universal service in an area served by more
              than one eligible telecommunications carrier, the State
              commission shall require the remaining eligible
              telecommunications carrier or carriers to ensure that all
              customers served by the relinquishing carrier will continue to
              be served, and shall require sufficient notice to permit the
              purchase or construction of adequate facilities by any
              remaining eligible telecommunications carrier. The State
              commission shall establish a time, not to exceed one year after
              the State commission approves such relinquishment under this
              paragraph, within which such purchase or construction shall be
              completed.
                `(5) SERVICE AREA DEFINED- The term `service area' means a
              geographic area established by a State commission for the
              purpose of determining universal service obligations and
              support mechanisms. In the case of an area served by a rural
              telephone company, `service area' means such company's `study
              area' unless and until the Commission and the States, after
              taking into account recommendations of a Federal-State Joint
              Board instituted under section 410(c), establish a different
              definition of service area for such company.'.

              operations of an integrated public utility system;
                `(3) the Commission shall have no jurisdiction under this Act

              shall authorize the Commission to withhold the information from
              Congress, or prevent the Commission from complying with a
              request for information from any other Federal or State

              of subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of this paragraph for
              each State for which the authorization is sought.
                    `(A) PRESENCE OF A FACILITIES-BASED COMPETITOR- A Bell
                  operating company meets the requirements of this
                  subparagraph if it has entered into one or more binding
                  agreements that have been approved under <A href="#S252">section 252</a>
                  specifying the terms and conditions under which the Bell
                  operating company is providing access and interconnection
                  to its network facilities for the network facilities of one
                  or more unaffiliated competing providers of telephone
                  exchange service (as defined in section 3(47)(A), but

                  subscribers. For the purpose of this subparagraph, such
                  telephone exchange service may be offered by such competing
                  providers either exclusively over their own telephone

                  Commission's regulations (47 C.F.R. 22.901 et seq.) shall

                    `(B) FAILURE TO REQUEST ACCESS- A Bell operating company

                  Telecommunications Act of 1996, no such provider has
                  requested the access and interconnection described in

                  shall be considered not to have received any request for
                  access and interconnection if the State commission of such

                  such a request have (i) failed to negotiate in good faith
                  as required by <A href="#S252">section 252</a>, or (ii) violated the terms of
                  an agreement approved under <A href="#S252">section 252</a> by the provider's
                  failure to comply, within a reasonable period of time, with
                  the implementation schedule contained in such agreement.
                `(2) SPECIFIC INTERCONNECTION REQUIREMENTS-

                        `(II) such company is generally offering access and
                      interconnection pursuant to a statement described in
                      paragraph (1)(B), and

              any in-region State. The application shall identify each State
              for which the authorization is sought.
                `(2) CONSULTATION-
                    `(A) CONSULTATION WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL- The
                  Commission shall notify the Attorney General promptly of
                  any application under paragraph (1). Before making any
                  determination under this subsection, the Commission shall
                  consult with the Attorney General, and if the Attorney
                  General submits any comments in writing, such comments

                  Commission under this paragraph, the Attorney General shall
                  provide to the Commission an evaluation of the application
                  using any standard the Attorney General considers
                  appropriate. The Commission shall give substantial weight
                  to the Attorney General's evaluation, but such evaluation
                  shall not have any preclusive effect on any Commission

                  requirements of subsection (c).
                `(3) DETERMINATION- Not later than 90 days after receiving an
              application under paragraph (1), the Commission shall issue a
              written determination approving or denying the authorization
              requested in the application for each State. The Commission
              shall not approve the authorization requested in an application
              submitted under paragraph (1) unless it finds that--
                    `(A) the petitioning Bell operating company has met the
                  requirements of subsection (c)(1) and--

                      implemented the competitive checklist in subsection
                      (c)(2)(B); or

                      generally offered pursuant to a statement under
                      subsection (c)(1)(B), such statement offers all of the
                      items included in the competitive checklist in
                      subsection (c)(2)(B);
                    `(B) the requested authorization will be carried out in
                  accordance with the requirements of section <a href="#S272">s272</a>; and
                    `(C) the requested authorization is consistent with the
                  public interest, convenience, and necessity.
              The Commission shall state the basis for its approval or denial
              of the application.
                `(4) LIMITATION ON COMMISSION- The Commission may not, by
              rule or otherwise, limit or extend the terms used in the

                `(6) ENFORCEMENT OF CONDITIONS-
                    `(A) COMMISSION AUTHORITY- If at any time after the
                  approval of an application under paragraph (3), the
                  Commission determines that a Bell operating company has
                  ceased to meet any of the conditions required for such
                  approval, the Commission may, after notice and opportunity
                  for a hearing--
                        `(i) issue an order to such company to correct the
                      deficiency;
                        `(ii) impose a penalty on such company pursuant to
                      title V; or
                        `(iii) suspend or revoke such approval.
                    `(B) RECEIPT AND REVIEW OF COMPLAINTS- The Commission
                  shall establish procedures for the review of complaints
                  concerning failures by Bell operating companies to meet
                  conditions required for approval under paragraph (3).
                  Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Commission shall
                  act on such complaint within 90 days.
            `(e) LIMITATIONS-
                `(1) JOINT MARKETING OF LOCAL AND LONG DISTANCE SERVICES-
              Until a Bell operating company is authorized pursuant to
              subsection (d) to provide interLATA services in an in-region
              State, or until 36 months have passed since the date of
              enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, whichever is
              earlier, a telecommunications carrier that serves greater than
              5 percent of the Nation's presubscribed access lines may not
              jointly market in such State telephone exchange service
              obtained from such company pursuant to section <a href="#S251">251</a>(c)(4) with
              interLATA services offered by that telecommunications carrier.
                `(2) INTRALATA TOLL DIALING PARITY-
                    `(A) PROVISION REQUIRED- A Bell operating company granted
                  authority to provide interLATA services under subsection
                  (d) shall provide intraLATA toll dialing parity throughout
                  that State coincident with its exercise of that authority.
                    `(B) LIMITATION- Except for single-LATA States and States
                  that have issued an order by December 19, 1995, requiring a
                  Bell operating company to implement intraLATA toll dialing
                  parity, a State may not require a Bell operating company to
                  implement intraLATA toll dialing parity in that State
                  before a Bell operating company has been granted authority
                  under this section to provide interLATA services
                  originating in that State or before 3 years after the date
                  of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
                  whichever is earlier. Nothing in this subparagraph
                  precludes a State from issuing an order requiring intraLATA
                  toll dialing parity in that State prior to either such date
                  so long as such order does not take effect until after the
                  earlier of either such dates.
            `(f) EXCEPTION FOR PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES- Neither
          subsection (a) nor section <a href="#S273">273</a> shall prohibit a Bell operating
          company or affiliate from engaging, at any time after the date of
          enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, in any activity to
          the extent authorized by, and subject to the terms and conditions
          contained in, an order entered by the United States District Court
          for the District of Columbia pursuant to section VII or VIII(C) of
          the AT&amp;T Consent Decree if such order was entered on or before such
          date of enactment, to the extent such order is not reversed or
          vacated on appeal. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to
          limit, or to impose terms or conditions on, an activity in which a
          Bell operating company is otherwise authorized to engage under any
          other provision of this section.
            `(g) DEFINITION OF INCIDENTAL INTERLATA SERVICES- For purposes of
          this section, the term `incidental interLATA services' means the
          interLATA provision by a Bell operating company or its affiliate--
                `(1)(A) of audio programming, video programming, or other
              programming services to subscribers to such services of such
              company or affiliate;
                `(B) of the capability for interaction by such subscribers to
              select or respond to such audio programming, video programming,
              or other programming services;
                `(C) to distributors of audio programming or video
              programming that such company or affiliate owns or controls, or
              is licensed by the copyright owner of such programming (or by
              an assignee of such owner) to distribute; or
                `(D) of alarm monitoring services;
                `(2) of two-way interactive video services or Internet
              services over dedicated facilities to or for elementary and
              secondary schools as defined in section <a href="#S254">254</a>(h)(5);
                `(3) of commercial mobile services in accordance with section
              332(c) of this Act and with the regulations prescribed by the
              Commission pursuant to paragraph (8) of such section;
                `(4) of a service that permits a customer that is located in
              one LATA to retrieve stored information from, or file
              information for storage in, information storage facilities of
              such company that are located in another LATA;
                `(5) of signaling information used in connection with the
              provision of telephone exchange services or exchange access by
              a local exchange carrier; or
                `(6) of network control signaling information to, and receipt
              of such signaling information from, common carriers offering
              interLATA services at any location within the area in which
              such Bell operating company provides telephone exchange
              services or exchange access.
            `(h) LIMITATIONS- The provisions of subsection (g) are intended
          to be narrowly construed. The interLATA services provided under
          subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of subsection (g)(1) are limited to
          those interLATA transmissions incidental to the provision by a Bell
          operating company or its affiliate of video, audio, and other
          programming services that the company or its affiliate is engaged
          in providing to the public.  The Commission shall ensure that the
          provision of services authorized under subsection (g) by a Bell
          operating company or its affiliate will not adversely affect
          telephone exchange service ratepayers or competition in any
          telecommunications market.
            `(i) ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS- As used in this section--
                `(1) IN-REGION STATE- The term `in-region State' means a
              State in which a Bell operating company or any of its
              affiliates was authorized to provide wireline telephone
              exchange service pursuant to the reorganization plan approved
              under the AT&amp;T Consent Decree, as in effect on the day before
              the date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
                `(2) AUDIO PROGRAMMING SERVICES- The term `audio programming
              services' means programming provided by, or generally
              considered to be comparable to programming provided by, a radio
              broadcast station.
                `(3) VIDEO PROGRAMMING SERVICES; OTHER PROGRAMMING SERVICES-
              The terms `video programming service' and `other programming
              services' have the same meanings as such terms have under
              section <a href="#S602">602</a> of this Act.
            `(j) CERTAIN SERVICE APPLICATIONS TREATED AS IN-REGION SERVICE
          APPLICATIONS- For purposes of this section, a Bell operating
          company application to provide 800 service, private line service,
          or their equivalents that--
                `(1) terminate in an in-region State of that Bell operating
              company, and
                `(2) allow the called party to determine the interLATA carrier,
          shall be considered an in-region service subject to the
          requirements of subsection (b)(1).

              purpose other than purposes authorized in writing by the owner
              of such information, even after such entity ceases to be so
              engaged.
                `(3) MANUFACTURING SAFEGUARDS- (A) Except as prohibited in
              paragraph (1), and subject to paragraph (6), any entity which

                  affiliate in the establishment of standards, generic
                  requirements, or product certification;
                    `(ii) not disclose to the manufacturing affiliate any
                  proprietary information that has been received at any time

              accredited standards development organization and that
              establishes industry-wide standards for telecommunications
              equipment or customer premises equipment, or industry-wide
              generic network requirements for such equipment, or that
              certifies telecommunications equipment or customer premises
              equipment manufactured by an unaffiliated entity, shall--
                    `(A) establish and publish any industry-wide standard

                  substantial modification of an existing industry-wide
                  standard or industry-wide generic requirement for,
                  telecommunications equipment or customer premises equipment

                        `(i) such entity shall issue a public notice of its

                      interested industry parties to fund and participate in
                      such efforts on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory
                      basis, administered in such a manner as not to
                      unreasonably exclude any interested industry party;
                        `(iii) such entity shall publish a text for comment
                      by such parties as have agreed to participate in the
                      process pursuant to clause (ii), provide such parties a
                      full opportunity to submit comments, and respond to
                      comments from such parties;
                        `(iv) such entity shall publish a final text of the
                      industry-wide standard or industry-wide generic
                      requirement, including the comments in their entirety,
                      of any funding party which requests to have its
                      comments so published; and
                        `(v) such entity shall attempt, prior to publishing a
                      text for comment, to agree with the funding parties as
                      a group on a mutually satisfactory dispute resolution
                      process which such parties shall utilize as their sole
                      recourse in the event of a dispute on technical issues
                      as to which there is disagreement between any funding
                      party and the entity conducting such activities, except
                      that if no dispute resolution process is agreed to by
                      all the parties, a funding party may utilize the
                      dispute resolution procedures established pursuant to
                      paragraph (5) of this subsection;
                    `(B) engage in product certification for
                  telecommunications equipment or customer premises equipment
                  manufactured by unaffiliated entities only if--
                        `(i) such activity is performed pursuant to published
                      criteria;
                        `(ii) such activity is performed pursuant to
                      auditable criteria; and
                        `(iii) such activity is performed pursuant to
                      available industry-accepted testing methods and
                      standards, where applicable, unless otherwise agreed
                      upon by the parties funding and performing such activity;
                    `(C) not undertake any actions to monopolize or attempt
                  to monopolize the market for such services; and
                    `(D) not preferentially treat its own telecommunications
                  equipment or customer premises equipment, or that of its
                  affiliate, over that of any other entity in establishing
                  and publishing industry-wide standards or industry-wide
                  generic requirements for, and in certification of,
                  telecommunications equipment and customer premises equipment.
                `(5) ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION- Within 90 days after the
              date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the
              Commission shall prescribe a dispute resolution process to be
              utilized in the event that a dispute resolution process is not
              agreed upon by all the parties when establishing and publishing
              any industry-wide standard or industry-wide generic requirement
              for telecommunications equipment or customer premises
              equipment, pursuant to paragraph (4)(A)(v). The Commission
              shall not establish itself as a party to the dispute resolution
              process. Such dispute resolution process shall permit any
              funding party to resolve a dispute with the entity conducting
              the activity that significantly affects such funding party's
              interests, in an open, nondiscriminatory, and unbiased fashion,
              within 30 days after the filing of such dispute. Such disputes
              may be filed within 15 days after the date the funding party
              receives a response to its comments from the entity conducting
              the activity. The Commission shall establish penalties to be
              assessed for delays caused by referral of frivolous disputes to
              the dispute resolution process.
                `(6) SUNSET- The requirements of paragraphs (3) and (4) shall
              terminate for the particular relevant activity when the
              Commission determines that there are alternative sources of
              industry-wide standards, industry-wide generic requirements, or
              product certification for a particular class of
              telecommunications equipment or customer premises equipment
              available in the United States. Alternative sources shall be
              deemed to exist when such sources provide commercially viable
              alternatives that are providing such services to customers. The
              Commission shall act on any application for such a
              determination within 90 days after receipt of such application,
              and shall receive public comment on such application.
                `(7) ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY- For the

              other carriers shall not be required as a prerequisite for such
              introduction or deployment.

          respect to any common carrier subject to this Act.
            `(g) ADDITIONAL RULES AND REGULATIONS- The Commission may
          prescribe such additional rules and regulations as the Commission
          determines are necessary to carry out the provisions of this
          section, and otherwise to prevent discrimination and
          cross-subsidization in a Bell operating company's dealings with its
          affiliate and with third parties.
            `(h) DEFINITION- As used in this section, the term

                `(2) PERMISSIBLE JOINT ACTIVITIES-
                    `(A) JOINT TELEMARKETING- A Bell operating company may
                  provide inbound telemarketing or referral services related
                  to the provision of electronic publishing for a separated
                  affiliate, electronic publishing joint venture, affiliate,
                  or unaffiliated electronic publisher:  <i> Provided, </i>

                  a separated affiliate, electronic publishing joint venture,
                  or affiliate, such services shall be made available to all

                    `(B) TEAMING ARRANGEMENTS- A Bell operating company may
                  engage in nondiscriminatory teaming or business
                  arrangements to engage in electronic publishing with any

                  authorized by this section, and (ii) the Bell operating

                    `(C) ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING JOINT VENTURES- A Bell
                  operating company or affiliate may participate on a
                  nonexclusive basis in electronic publishing joint ventures
                  with entities that are not a Bell operating company,
                  affiliate, or separated affiliate to provide electronic
                  publishing services, if the Bell operating company or
                  affiliate has not more than a 50 percent direct or indirect
                  equity interest (or the equivalent thereof) or the right to
                  more than 50 percent of the gross revenues under a revenue
                  sharing or royalty agreement in any electronic publishing
                  joint venture. Officers and employees of a Bell operating

                  electronic publishers, the Commission for good cause shown
                  may authorize the Bell operating company or affiliate to
                  have a larger equity interest, revenue share, or voting
                  control but not to exceed 80 percent. A Bell operating
                  company participating in an electronic publishing joint
                  venture may provide promotion, marketing, sales, or
                  advertising personnel and services to such joint venture.
            `(d) BELL OPERATING COMPANY REQUIREMENT- A Bell operating company
          under common ownership or control with a separated affiliate or
          electronic publishing joint venture shall provide network access
          and interconnections for basic telephone service to electronic
          publishers at just and reasonable rates that are tariffed (so long
          as rates for such services are subject to regulation) and that are
          not higher on a per-unit basis than those charged for such services
          to any other electronic publisher or any separated affiliate
          engaged in electronic publishing.
            `(e) PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION-
                `(1) DAMAGES- Any person claiming that any act or practice of
              any Bell operating company, affiliate, or separated affiliate
              constitutes a violation of this section may file a complaint
              with the Commission or bring suit as provided in section <a href="#S207">207</a> of

              violation that is discovered by a compliance review as required
              by subsection (b)(7) of this section and corrected within 90
              days.
                `(2) CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS- In addition to the provisions
              of paragraph (1), any person claiming that any act or practice
              of any Bell operating company, affiliate, or separated
              affiliate constitutes a violation of this section may make
              application to the Commission for an order to cease and desist
              such violation or may make application in any district court of
              the United States of competent jurisdiction for an order
              enjoining such acts or practices or for an order compelling
              compliance with such requirement.
            `(f) SEPARATED AFFILIATE REPORTING REQUIREMENT- Any separated
          affiliate under this section shall file with the Commission annual

          required by regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

          alarm monitoring service. Such procedures shall ensure that the
          Commission will make a final determination with respect to any such
          complaint within 120 days after receipt of the complaint. If the
          complaint contains an appropriate showing that the alleged
          violation occurred, as determined by the Commission in accordance

          of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
            `(e) DEFINITION OF ALARM MONITORING SERVICE- The term `alarm
          monitoring service' means a service that uses a device located at a

              vandalism, bodily injury, or other emergency, and
                `(2) to transmit a signal regarding such threat by means of
              transmission facilities of a local exchange carrier or one of
              its affiliates to a remote monitoring center to alert a person

                `(2) PUBLIC INTEREST TELEPHONES- In the rulemaking conducted
              pursuant to paragraph (1), the Commission shall determine

<h3><a name="S201">SEC. 201.</a> BROADCAST SPECTRUM FLEXIBILITY.</h3>
<pre>
            Title III is amended by inserting after section 335 (47 U.S.C.
          335) the following new section:
          `SEC. 336. BROADCAST SPECTRUM FLEXIBILITY.
            `(a) COMMISSION ACTION- If the Commission determines to issue
          additional licenses for advanced television services, the
          Commission--
                `(1) should limit the initial eligibility for such licenses
              to persons that, as of the date of such issuance, are licensed
              to operate a television broadcast station or hold a permit to
              construct such a station (or both); and
                `(2) shall adopt regulations that allow the holders of such
              licenses to offer such ancillary or supplementary services on
              designated frequencies as may be consistent with the public
              interest, convenience, and necessity.
            `(b) CONTENTS OF REGULATIONS- In prescribing the regulations
          required by subsection (a), the Commission shall--
                `(1) only permit such licensee or permittee to offer
              ancillary or supplementary services if the use of a designated
              frequency for such services is consistent with the technology
              or method designated by the Commission for the provision of
              advanced television services;
                `(2) limit the broadcasting of ancillary or supplementary
              services on designated frequencies so as to avoid derogation of
              any advanced television services, including high definition
              television broadcasts, that the Commission may require using
              such frequencies;
                `(3) apply to any other ancillary or supplementary service
              such of the Commission's regulations as are applicable to the
              offering of analogous services by any other person, except that
              no ancillary or supplementary service shall have any rights to
              carriage under section 614 or 615 or be deemed a multichannel
              video programming distributor for purposes of section 628;
                `(4) adopt such technical and other requirements as may be
              necessary or appropriate to assure the quality of the signal
              used to provide advanced television services, and may adopt
              regulations that stipulate the minimum number of hours per day
              that such signal must be transmitted; and
                `(5) prescribe such other regulations as may be necessary for
              the protection of the public interest, convenience, and
              necessity.
            `(c) RECOVERY OF LICENSE- If the Commission grants a license for
          advanced television services to a person that, as of the date of
          such issuance, is licensed to operate a television broadcast
          station or holds a permit to construct such a station (or both),
          the Commission shall, as a condition of such license, require that
          either the additional license or the original license held by the
          licensee be surrendered to the Commission for reallocation or
          reassignment (or both) pursuant to Commission regulation.
            `(d) PUBLIC INTEREST REQUIREMENT- Nothing in this section shall
          be construed as relieving a television broadcasting station from
          its obligation to serve the public interest, convenience, and
          necessity. In the Commission's review of any application for
          renewal of a broadcast license for a television station that
          provides ancillary or supplementary services, the television
          licensee shall establish that all of its program services on the
          existing or advanced television spectrum are in the public
          interest. Any violation of the Commission rules applicable to
          ancillary or supplementary services shall reflect upon the
          licensee's qualifications for renewal of its license.
            `(e) FEES-
                `(1) SERVICES TO WHICH FEES APPLY- If the regulations
              prescribed pursuant to subsection (a) permit a licensee to
              offer ancillary or supplementary services on a designated
              frequency--
                    `(A) for which the payment of a subscription fee is
                  required in order to receive such services, or
                    `(B) for which the licensee directly or indirectly
                  receives compensation from a third party in return for
                  transmitting material furnished by such third party (other
                  than commercial advertisements used to support broadcasting
                  for which a subscription fee is not required),
              the Commission shall establish a program to assess and collect
              from the licensee for such designated frequency an annual fee
              or other schedule or method of payment that promotes the
              objectives described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph
              (2).
                `(2) COLLECTION OF FEES- The program required by paragraph
              (1) shall--
                    `(A) be designed (i) to recover for the public a portion
                  of the value of the public spectrum resource made available
                  for such commercial use, and (ii) to avoid unjust
                  enrichment through the method employed to permit such uses
                  of that resource;
                    `(B) recover for the public an amount that, to the extent
                  feasible, equals but does not exceed (over the term of the
                  license) the amount that would have been recovered had such
                  services been licensed pursuant to the provisions of
                  section 309(j) of this Act and the Commission's regulations
                  thereunder; and
                    `(C) be adjusted by the Commission from time to time in
                  order to continue to comply with the requirements of this
                  paragraph.

          enforcement of its one-to-a-market ownership rules under section

            Section 307(c) (47 U.S.C. 307(c)) is amended to read as follows:
            `(c) TERMS OF LICENSES-
                `(1) INITIAL AND RENEWAL LICENSES- Each license granted for
              the operation of a broadcasting station shall be for a term of
              not to exceed 8 years.  Upon application therefor, a renewal of
              such license may be granted from time to time for a term of not
              to exceed 8 years from the date of expiration of the preceding
              license, if the Commission finds that public interest,
              convenience, and necessity would be served thereby.  Consistent
              with the foregoing provisions of this subsection, the
              Commission may by rule prescribe the period or periods for
              which licenses shall be granted and renewed for particular
              classes of stations, but the Commission may not adopt or follow
              any rule which would preclude it, in any case involving a
              station of a particular class, from granting or renewing a
              license for a shorter period than that prescribed for stations
              of such class if, in its judgment, the public interest,
              convenience, or necessity would be served by such action.
                `(2) MATERIALS IN APPLICATION- In order to expedite action on
              applications for renewal of broadcasting station licenses and
              in order to avoid needless expense to applicants for such
              renewals, the Commission shall not require any such applicant
              to file any information which previously has been furnished to
              the Commission or which is not directly material to the
              considerations that affect the granting or denial of such
              application, but the Commission may require any new or
              additional facts it deems necessary to make its findings.
                `(3) CONTINUATION PENDING DECISION- Pending any hearing and
              final decision on such an application and the disposition of
              any petition for rehearing pursuant to section 405, the
              Commission shall continue such license in effect.'.

              adding at the end thereof the following new subsection:
            `(k) BROADCAST STATION RENEWAL PROCEDURES-
                `(1) STANDARDS FOR RENEWAL- If the licensee of a broadcast
              station submits an application to the Commission for renewal of
              such license, the Commission shall grant the application if it
              finds, with respect to that station, during the preceding term
              of its license--
                    `(A) the station has served the public interest,
                  convenience, and necessity;

                  of this Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission
                  which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse.
                `(2) CONSEQUENCE OF FAILURE TO MEET STANDARD- If any licensee
              of a broadcast station fails to meet the requirements of this
              subsection, the Commission may deny the application for renewal
              in accordance with paragraph (3), or grant such application on

              a term less than the maximum otherwise permitted.
                `(3) STANDARDS FOR DENIAL- If the Commission determines,
              after notice and opportunity for a hearing as provided in
              subsection (e), that a licensee has failed to meet the
              requirements specified in paragraph (1) and that no mitigating
              factors justify the imposition of lesser sanctions, the
              Commission shall--
                    `(A) issue an order denying the renewal application filed
                  by such licensee under section 308; and
                    `(B) only thereafter accept and consider such
                  applications for a construction permit as may be filed
                  under section 308 specifying the channel or broadcasting
                  facilities of the former licensee.
                `(4) COMPETITOR CONSIDERATION PROHIBITED- In making the
              determinations specified in paragraph (1) or (2), the
              Commission shall not consider whether the public interest,
              convenience, and necessity might be served by the grant of a
              license to a person other than the renewal applicant.'.
                (2) CONFORMING AMENDMENT- Section 309(d) (47 U.S.C. 309(d))
              is amended by inserting after `with subsection (a)' each place
              it appears the following: `(or subsection (k) in the case of

          subsection:

          commentor as constituting violent programming.'.

              complainant that there are reasonable grounds to believe that
              the discounted price is predatory, the cable system shall have
              the burden of showing that its discounted price is not
              predatory.'.

                  multichannel video programming distributor using the
                  facilities of such carrier or its affiliate) offers video
                  programming services directly to subscribers by any means
                  (other than direct-to-home satellite services) in the
                  franchise area of an unaffiliated cable operator which is
                  providing cable service in that franchise area, but only if
                  the video programming services so offered in that area are
                  comparable to the video programming services provided by
                  the unaffiliated cable operator in that area.'.

                  the varying levels of functionality of the equipment within
                  each such broad category. Such aggregation shall not be
                  permitted with respect to equipment used by subscribers who
                  receive only a rate regulated basic service tier.
                    `(B) REVISION TO COMMISSION RULES; FORMS- Within 120 days

          respect to a cable system that is owned and operated by the
          original franchisee of such system shall not be disallowed, in
          whole or in part, in the determination of whether the rates for any
          tier of service or any type of equipment that is subject to
          regulation under this section are lawful.'.
                (2) EFFECTIVE DATE- The amendment made by paragraph (1) shall
              take effect on the date of enactment of this Act and shall be

                    `(B) in the case of a local exchange carrier, such
                  system, in the aggregate with any other system in which
                  such carrier has an interest, serves less than 10 percent
                  of the households in the telephone service area of such
                  carrier.
                `(2) JOINT USE- Notwithstanding subsection (c), a local
              exchange carrier may obtain, with the concurrence of the cable
              operator on the rates, terms, and conditions, the use of that
              part of the transmission facilities of a cable system extending
              from the last multi-user terminal to the premises of the end
              user, if such use is reasonably limited in scope and duration,
              as determined by the Commission.
                `(3) ACQUISITIONS IN COMPETITIVE MARKETS- Notwithstanding
              subsections (a) and (c), a local exchange carrier may obtain a
              controlling interest in, or form a joint venture or other
              partnership with, or provide financing to, a cable system
              (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as `the subject
              cable system'), if--
                    `(A) the subject cable system operates in a television
                  market that is not in the top 25 markets, and such market
                  has more than 1 cable system operator, and the subject
                  cable system is not the cable system with the most
                  subscribers in such television market;
                    `(B) the subject cable system and the cable system with
                  the most subscribers in such television market held on May
                  1, 1995, cable television franchises from the largest
                  municipality in the television market and the boundaries of
                  such franchises were identical on such date;
                    `(C) the subject cable system is not owned by or under
                  common ownership or control of any one of the 50 cable
                  system operators with the most subscribers as such
                  operators existed on May 1, 1995; and
                    `(D) the system with the most subscribers in the
                  television market is owned by or under common ownership or
                  control of any one of the 10 largest cable system operators
                  as such operators existed on May 1, 1995.
                `(4) EXEMPT CABLE SYSTEMS- Subsection (a) does not apply to
              any cable system if--
                    `(A) the cable system serves no more than 17,000 cable
                  subscribers, of which no less than 8,000 live within an
                  urban area, and no less than 6,000 live within a
                  nonurbanized area as of June 1, 1995;
                    `(B) the cable system is not owned by, or under common
                  ownership or control with, any of the 50 largest cable
                  system operators in existence on June 1, 1995; and
                    `(C) the cable system operates in a television market
                  that was not in the top 100 television markets as of June
                  1, 1995.
                `(5) SMALL CABLE SYSTEMS IN NONURBAN AREAS- Notwithstanding
              subsections (a) and (c), a local exchange carrier with less
              than $100,000,000 in annual operating revenues (or any
              affiliate of such carrier owned by, operated by, controlled by,
              or under common control with such carrier) may purchase or
              otherwise acquire more than a 10 percent financial interest in,
              or any management interest in, or enter into a joint venture or
              partnership with, any cable system within the local exchange
              carrier's telephone service area that serves no more than
              20,000 cable subscribers, if no more than 12,000 of those
              subscribers live within an urbanized area, as defined by the
              Bureau of the Census.
                `(6) WAIVERS- The Commission may waive the restrictions of
              subsections (a), (b), or (c) only if--
                    `(A) the Commission determines that, because of the
                  nature of the market served by the affected cable system or
                  facilities used to provide telephone exchange service--
                        `(i) the affected cable operator or local exchange
                      carrier would be subjected to undue economic distress
                      by the enforcement of such provisions;
                        `(ii) the system or facilities would not be
                      economically viable if such provisions were enforced; or
                        `(iii) the anticompetitive effects of the proposed
                      transaction are clearly outweighed in the public
                      interest by the probable effect of the transaction in
                      meeting the convenience and needs of the community to
                      be served; and
                    `(B) the local franchising authority approves of such
                  waiver.
            `(e) DEFINITION OF TELEPHONE SERVICE AREA- For purposes of this
          section, the term `telephone service area' when used in connection
          with a common carrier subject in whole or in part to title II of
          this Act means the area within which such carrier provided
          telephone exchange service as of January 1, 1993, but if any common
          carrier after such date transfers its telephone exchange service
          facilities to another common carrier, the area to which such
          facilities provide telephone exchange service shall be treated as
          part of the telephone service area of the acquiring common carrier
          and not of the selling common carrier.

<h4>`<a name="S653">SEC. 653.</a> ESTABLISHMENT OF OPEN VIDEO SYSTEMS.</h4>
<pre>
            `(a) OPEN VIDEO SYSTEMS-
                `(1) CERTIFICATES OF COMPLIANCE- A local exchange carrier may
              provide cable service to its cable service subscribers in its
              telephone service area through an open video system that
              complies with this section. To the extent permitted by such
              regulations as the Commission may prescribe consistent with the
              public interest, convenience, and necessity, an operator of a
              cable system or any other person may provide video programming
              through an open video system that complies with this section.
              An operator of an open video system shall qualify for reduced
              regulatory burdens under subsection (c) of this section if the
              operator of such system certifies to the Commission that such
              carrier complies with the Commission's regulations under
              subsection (b) and the Commission approves such certification.
              The Commission shall publish notice of the receipt of any such
              certification and shall act to approve or disapprove any such
              certification within 10 days after receipt of such certification.
                `(2) DISPUTE RESOLUTION- The Commission shall have the
              authority to resolve disputes under this section and the
              regulations prescribed thereunder. Any such dispute shall be
              resolved within 180 days after notice of such dispute is
              submitted to the Commission. At that time or subsequently in a
              separate damages proceeding, the Commission may, in the case of
              any violation of this section, require carriage, award damages
              to any person denied carriage, or any combination of such
              sanctions.  Any aggrieved party may seek any other remedy
              available under this Act.
            `(b) COMMISSION ACTIONS-
                `(1) REGULATIONS REQUIRED- Within 6 months after the date of
              enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Commission
              shall complete all actions necessary (including any
              reconsideration) to prescribe regulations that--
                    `(A) except as required pursuant to section 611, 614, or
                  615, prohibit an operator of an open video system from
                  discriminating among video programming providers with
                  regard to carriage on its open video system, and ensure
                  that the rates, terms, and conditions for such carriage are
                  just and reasonable, and are not unjustly or unreasonably
                  discriminatory;
                    `(B) if demand exceeds the channel capacity of the open
                  video system, prohibit an operator of an open video system
                  and its affiliates from selecting the video programming
                  services for carriage on more than one-third of the
                  activated channel capacity on such system, but nothing in
                  this subparagraph shall be construed to limit the number of
                  channels that the carrier and its affiliates may offer to
                  provide directly to subscribers;
                    `(C) permit an operator of an open video system to carry
                  on only one channel any video programming service that is
                  offered by more than one video programming provider
                  (including the local exchange carrier's video programming
                  affiliate):  <i> Provided,  </i> That
                  subscribers have ready and immediate access to any such
                  video programming service;
                    `(D) extend to the distribution of video programming over
                  open video systems the Commission's regulations concerning
                  sports exclusivity (47 C.F.R. 76.67), network
                  nonduplication (47 C.F.R. 76.92 et seq.), and syndicated
                  exclusivity (47 C.F.R. 76.151 et seq.); and
                    `(E)(i) prohibit an operator of an open video system from
                  unreasonably discriminating in favor of the operator or its
                  affiliates with regard to material or information
                  (including advertising) provided by the operator to
                  subscribers for the purposes of selecting programming on
                  the open video system, or in the way such material or
                  information is presented to subscribers;
                    `(ii) require an operator of an open video system to
                  ensure that video programming providers or copyright
                  holders (or both) are able suitably and uniquely to
                  identify their programming services to subscribers;
                    `(iii) if such identification is transmitted as part of
                  the programming signal, require the carrier to transmit
                  such identification without change or alteration; and
                    `(iv) prohibit an operator of an open video system from
                  omitting television broadcast stations or other
                  unaffiliated video programming services carried on such
                  system from any navigational device, guide, or menu.
                `(2) CONSUMER ACCESS- Subject to the requirements of
              paragraph (1) and the regulations thereunder, nothing in this
              section prohibits a common carrier or its affiliate from
              negotiating mutually agreeable terms and conditions with
              over-the-air broadcast stations and other unaffiliated video
              programming providers to allow consumer access to their signals
              on any level or screen of any gateway, menu, or other program
              guide, whether provided by the carrier or its affiliate.
            `(c) REDUCED REGULATORY BURDENS FOR OPEN VIDEO SYSTEMS-
                `(1) IN GENERAL- Any provision that applies to a cable
              operator under--
                    `(A) sections 613 (other than subsection (a) thereof),
                  616, 623(f), 628, 631, and 634 of this title, shall apply,
                    `(B) sections 611, 614, and 615 of this title, and
                  section 325 of title III, shall apply in accordance with
                  the regulations prescribed under paragraph (2), and
                    `(C) sections 612 and 617, and parts III and IV (other
                  than sections 623(f), 628, 631, and 634), of this title
                  shall not apply,
              to any operator of an open video system for which the
              Commission has approved a certification under this section.
                `(2) IMPLEMENTATION-
                    `(A) COMMISSION ACTION- In the rulemaking proceeding to
                  prescribe the regulations required by subsection (b)(1),
                  the Commission shall, to the extent possible, impose
                  obligations that are no greater or lesser than the
                  obligations contained in the provisions described in
                  paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection. The Commission shall
                  complete all action (including any reconsideration) to
                  prescribe such regulations no later than 6 months after the
                  date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
                    `(B) FEES- An operator of an open video system under this
                  part may be subject to the payment of fees on the gross
                  revenues of the operator for the provision of cable service
                  imposed by a local franchising authority or other
                  governmental entity, in lieu of the franchise fees
                  permitted under section 622. The rate at which such fees
                  are imposed shall not exceed the rate at which franchise
                  fees are imposed on any cable operator transmitting video
                  programming in the franchise area, as determined in
                  accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission.
                  An operator of an open video system may designate that
                  portion of a subscriber's bill attributable to the fee
                  under this subparagraph as a separate item on the bill.
                `(3) REGULATORY STREAMLINING- With respect to the
              establishment and operation of an open video system, the
              requirements of this section shall apply in lieu of, and not in
              addition to, the requirements of title II.
                `(4) TREATMENT AS CABLE OPERATOR- Nothing in this Act
              precludes a video programming provider making use of an open
              video system from being treated as an operator of a cable
              system for purposes of section 111 of title 17, United States
              Code.
            `(d) DEFINITION OF TELEPHONE SERVICE AREA- For purposes of this
          section, the term `telephone service area' when used in connection
          with a common carrier subject in whole or in part to title II of
          this Act means the area within which such carrier is offering
          telephone exchange service.'.

              does not include services providing video programming
              prescheduled by the programming provider;'.
                (3) TERMINATION OF VIDEO-DIALTONE REGULATIONS- The
              Commission's regulations and policies with respect to video

          thereof the following new paragraph:
            `(3)(A) If a cable operator or affiliate thereof is engaged in
          the provision of telecommunications services--

<pre>
            Part III of title VI is amended by inserting after section 628
          (47 U.S.C. 548) the following new section:
</pre>
<h4>`<a name="S629">SEC. 629.</a> COMPETITIVE AVAILABILITY OF NAVIGATION DEVICES.</h4>
<pre>
            `(a) COMMERCIAL CONSUMER AVAILABILITY OF EQUIPMENT USED TO ACCESS
          SERVICES PROVIDED BY MULTICHANNEL VIDEO PROGRAMMING DISTRIBUTORS-
          The Commission shall, in consultation with appropriate industry
          standard-setting organizations, adopt regulations to assure the
          commercial availability, to consumers of multichannel video
          programming and other services offered over multichannel video
          programming systems, of converter boxes, interactive communications
          equipment, and other equipment used by consumers to access
          multichannel video programming and other services offered over
          multichannel video programming systems, from manufacturers,
          retailers, and other vendors not affiliated with any multichannel
          video programming distributor. Such regulations shall not prohibit
          any multichannel video programming distributor from also offering
          converter boxes, interactive communications equipment, and other
          equipment used by consumers to access multichannel video
          programming and other services offered over multichannel video
          programming systems, to consumers, if the system operator's charges
          to consumers for such devices and equipment are separately stated
          and not subsidized by charges for any such service.
            `(b) PROTECTION OF SYSTEM SECURITY- The Commission shall not
          prescribe regulations under subsection (a) which would jeopardize
          security of multichannel video programming and other services
          offered over multichannel video programming systems, or impede the
          legal rights of a provider of such services to prevent theft of
          service.
            `(c) WAIVER- The Commission shall waive a regulation adopted
          under subsection (a) for a limited time upon an appropriate showing
          by a provider of multichannel video programming and other services
          offered over multichannel video programming systems, or an
          equipment provider, that such waiver is necessary to assist the
          development or introduction of a new or improved multichannel video
          programming or other service offered over multichannel video
          programming systems, technology, or products. Upon an appropriate
          showing, the Commission shall grant any such waiver request within
          90 days of any application filed under this subsection, and such
          waiver shall be effective for all service providers and products in
          that category and for all providers of services and products.
            `(d) AVOIDANCE OF REDUNDANT REGULATIONS-
                `(1) COMMERCIAL AVAILABILITY DETERMINATIONS- Determinations
              made or regulations prescribed by the Commission with respect
              to commercial availability to consumers of converter boxes,
              interactive communications equipment, and other equipment used
              by consumers to access multichannel video programming and other
              services offered over multichannel video programming systems,
              before the date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of
              1996 shall fulfill the requirements of this section.
                `(2) REGULATIONS- Nothing in this section affects section
              64.702(e) of the Commission's regulations (47 C.F.R. 64.702(e))
              or other Commission regulations governing interconnection and
              competitive provision of customer premises equipment used in
              connection with basic common carrier communications services.
            `(e) SUNSET- The regulations adopted under this section shall
          cease to apply when the Commission determines that--
                `(1) the market for the multichannel video programming
              distributors is fully competitive;
                `(2) the market for converter boxes, and interactive
              communications equipment, used in conjunction with that service
              is fully competitive; and
                `(3) elimination of the regulations would promote competition
              and the public interest.
            `(f) COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY- Nothing in this section shall be
          construed as expanding or limiting any authority that the
          Commission may have under law in effect before the date of
          enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.'.

<h3><a name="S305">SEC. 305.</a> VIDEO PROGRAMMING ACCESSIBILITY.</h3>
<pre>
            Title VII is amended by inserting after section 712 (47 U.S.C.
          612) the following new section:
</pre>
<h4><a name="S713">`SEC. 713.</a> VIDEO PROGRAMMING ACCESSIBILITY.</h4>
<pre>
            `(a) COMMISSION INQUIRY- Within 180 days after the date of
          enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Federal
          Communications Commission shall complete an inquiry to ascertain
          the level at which video programming is closed captioned. Such
          inquiry shall examine the extent to which existing or previously
          published programming is closed captioned, the size of the video
          programming provider or programming owner providing closed
          captioning, the size of the market served, the relative audience
          shares achieved, or any other related factors. The Commission shall
          submit to the Congress a report on the results of such inquiry.
            `(b) ACCOUNTABILITY CRITERIA- Within 18 months after such date of
          enactment, the Commission shall prescribe such regulations as are
          necessary to implement this section. Such regulations shall ensure
          that--
                `(1) video programming first published or exhibited after the
              effective date of such regulations is fully accessible through
              the provision of closed captions, except as provided in
              subsection (d); and
                `(2) video programming providers or owners maximize the
              accessibility of video programming first published or exhibited
              prior to the effective date of such regulations through the
              provision of closed captions, except as provided in subsection
              (d).
            `(c) DEADLINES FOR CAPTIONING- Such regulations shall include an
          appropriate schedule of deadlines for the provision of closed
          captioning of video programming.
            `(d) EXEMPTIONS- Notwithstanding subsection (b)--
                `(1) the Commission may exempt by regulation programs,
              classes of programs, or services for which the Commission has
              determined that the provision of closed captioning would be
              economically burdensome to the provider or owner of such
              programming;
                `(2) a provider of video programming or the owner of any
              program carried by the provider shall not be obligated to
              supply closed captions if such action would be inconsistent
              with contracts in effect on the date of enactment of the
              Telecommunications Act of 1996, except that nothing in this
              section shall be construed to relieve a video programming
              provider of its obligations to provide services required by
              Federal law; and
                `(3) a provider of video programming or program owner may
              petition the Commission for an exemption from the requirements
              of this section, and the Commission may grant such petition
              upon a showing that the requirements contained in this section
              would result in an undue burden.
            `(e) UNDUE BURDEN- The term `undue burden' means significant
          difficulty or expense. In determining whether the closed captions
          necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph would
          result in an undue economic burden, the factors to be considered
          include--
                `(1) the nature and cost of the closed captions for the
              programming;
                `(2) the impact on the operation of the provider or program
              owner;
                `(3) the financial resources of the provider or program
              owner; and
                `(4) the type of operations of the provider or program owner.
            `(f) VIDEO DESCRIPTIONS INQUIRY- Within 6 months after the date
          of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Commission
          shall commence an inquiry to examine the use of video descriptions
          on video programming in order to ensure the accessibility of video
          programming to persons with visual impairments, and report to
          Congress on its findings.  The Commission's report shall assess
          appropriate methods and schedules for phasing video descriptions
          into the marketplace, technical and quality standards for video
          descriptions, a definition of programming for which video
          descriptions would apply, and other technical and legal issues that
          the Commission deems appropriate.
            `(g) VIDEO DESCRIPTION- For purposes of this section, `video
          description' means the insertion of audio narrated descriptions of
          a television program's key visual elements into natural pauses
          between the program's dialogue.
            `(h) PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTIONS PROHIBITED- Nothing in this
          section shall be construed to authorize any private right of action
          to enforce any requirement of this section or any regulation
          thereunder. The Commission shall have exclusive jurisdiction with
          respect to any complaint under this section.'.

</pre>
<h3><a name="S401">SEC. 401.</a> REGULATORY FORBEARANCE.</h3>
<pre>
            Title I is amended by inserting after section 9 (47 U.S.C. 159)
          the following new section:
</pre>
<h4>`<a name="S10">SEC. 10.</a> COMPETITION IN PROVISION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE.</h4>
<pre>
            `(a) REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY- Notwithstanding section 332(c)(1)(A)
          of this Act, the Commission shall forbear from applying any
          regulation or any provision of this Act to a telecommunications
          carrier or telecommunications service, or class of
          telecommunications carriers or telecommunications services, in any
          or some of its or their geographic markets, if the Commission
          determines that--
                `(1) enforcement of such regulation or provision is not
              necessary to ensure that the charges, practices,
              classifications, or regulations by, for, or in connection with
              that telecommunications carrier or telecommunications service
              are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably
              discriminatory;
                `(2) enforcement of such regulation or provision is not
              necessary for the protection of consumers; and
                `(3) forbearance from applying such provision or regulation
              is consistent with the public interest.
            `(b) COMPETITIVE EFFECT TO BE WEIGHED- In making the
          determination under subsection (a)(3), the Commission shall
          consider whether forbearance from enforcing the provision or
          regulation will promote competitive market conditions, including
          the extent to which such forbearance will enhance competition among
          providers of telecommunications services. If the Commission
          determines that such forbearance will promote competition among
          providers of telecommunications services, that determination may be
          the basis for a Commission finding that forbearance is in the
          public interest.
            `(c) PETITION FOR FORBEARANCE- Any telecommunications carrier, or
          class of telecommunications carriers, may submit a petition to the
          Commission requesting that the Commission exercise the authority
          granted under this section with respect to that carrier or those
          carriers, or any service offered by that carrier or carriers. Any
          such petition shall be deemed granted if the Commission does not
          deny the petition for failure to meet the requirements for
          forbearance under subsection (a) within one year after the
          Commission receives it, unless the one-year period is extended by
          the Commission. The Commission may extend the initial one-year
          period by an additional 90 days if the Commission finds that an
          extension is necessary to meet the requirements of subsection (a).
          The Commission may grant or deny a petition in whole or in part and
          shall explain its decision in writing.
            `(d) LIMITATION- Except as provided in section <a href="#S251">251</a>(f), the
          Commission may not forbear from applying the requirements of
          section <a href="#S251">251</a>(c) or <a href="#S271">271</a> under subsection (a) of this section until it
          determines that those requirements have been fully implemented.
            `(e) STATE ENFORCEMENT AFTER COMMISSION FORBEARANCE- A State
          commission may not continue to apply or enforce any provision of
          this Act that the Commission has determined to forbear from
          applying under subsection (a).'.

              effect at the time of the review that apply to the operations
              or activities of any provider of telecommunications service; and
                `(2) shall determine whether any such regulation is no longer
              necessary in the public interest as the result of meaningful
              economic competition between providers of such service.
            `(b) EFFECT OF DETERMINATION- The Commission shall repeal or
          modify any regulation it determines to be no longer necessary in

              new or revised charge, classification, regulation, or practice
              on a streamlined basis. Any such charge, classification,
              regulation, or practice shall be deemed lawful and shall be
              effective 7 days (in the case of a reduction in rates) or 15
              days (in the case of an increase in rates) after the date on
              which it is filed with the Commission unless the Commission
              takes action under paragraph (1) before the end of that 7-day
              or 15-day period, as is appropriate.'.
                    (B) Section 208(b) (47 U.S.C. 208(b)) is amended--

                (2) EXTENSIONS OF LINES UNDER SECTION 214; ARMIS REPORTS- The
              Commission shall permit any common carrier--
                    (A) to be exempt from the requirements of section 214 of
                  the Communications Act of 1934 for the extension of any
                  line; and
                    (B) to file cost allocation manuals and ARMIS reports
                  annually, to the extent such carrier is required to file
                  such manuals or reports.
                (3) FORBEARANCE AUTHORITY NOT LIMITED- Nothing in this
              subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the

              under any other provision of this Act or other law.

          a permit for construction, except that the Commission may by
          regulation determine that a permit shall not be required for minor
          changes in the facilities of authorized broadcast stations. With
          respect to any other station or class of stations, the Commission

          shall have the equipment and apparatus prescribed therein inspected

          by the Commission. If, after such inspection, the Commission is
          satisfied that all relevant provisions of this Act and the station
          license have been complied with, the fact shall be so certified on
          the station license by the Commission. The Commission  shall make
          such additional inspections at frequent intervals as the Commission
          determines may be necessary to ensure compliance with the
          requirements of this Act. The Commission may, upon a finding that
          the public interest could be served thereby--
                `(1) waive the annual inspection required under this section
              for a period of up to 90 days for the sole purpose of enabling
              a vessel to complete its voyage and proceed to a port in the
              United States where an inspection can be held; or
                `(2) waive the annual inspection required under this section
              for a vessel that is in compliance with the radio provisions of
              the Safety Convention and that is operating solely in waters

              Government contracts, the Commission may enter into contracts
              with any person for the purpose of carrying out such
              inspections and certifying compliance with those requirements,
              and may, as part of any such contract, allow any such person to
              accept reimbursement from the license holder for travel and
              expense costs of any employee conducting an inspection or

                        `(i) makes, creates, or solicits, and
                        `(ii) initiates the transmission of,
                  any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other
                  communication which is obscene or indecent, knowing that
                  the recipient of the communication is under 18 years of
                  age, regardless of whether the maker of such communication
                  placed the call or initiated the communication;
                    `(C) makes a telephone call or utilizes a

          not more than two years, or both.'; and
                (2) by adding at the end the following new subsections:
            `(d) Whoever--
                `(1) in interstate or foreign communications knowingly--
                    `(A) uses an interactive computer service to send to a
                  specific person or persons under 18 years of age, or
                    `(B) uses any interactive computer service to display in
                  a manner available to a person under 18 years of age,
              any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other
              communication that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms
              patently offensive as measured by contemporary community
              standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs, regardless
              of whether the user of such service placed the call or
              initiated the communication; or
                `(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility under
              such person's control to be used for an activity prohibited by
              paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used for such activity,
          shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned
          not more than two years, or both.
            `(e) In addition to any other defenses available by law:
                `(1) No person shall be held to have violated subsection (a)
              or (d) solely for providing access or connection to or from a
              facility, system, or network not under that person's control,
              including transmission, downloading, intermediate storage,
              access software, or other related capabilities that are
              incidental to providing such access or connection that does not
              include the creation of the content of the communication.
                `(2) The defenses provided by paragraph (1) of this
              subsection shall not be applicable to a person who is a
              conspirator with an entity actively involved in the creation or
              knowing distribution of communications that violate this
              section, or who knowingly advertises the availability of such
              communications.
                `(3) The defenses provided in paragraph (1) of this
              subsection shall not be applicable to a person who provides
              access or connection to a facility, system, or network engaged
              in the violation of this section that is owned or controlled by
              such person.
                `(4) No employer shall be held liable under this section for
              the actions of an employee or agent unless the employee's or
              agent's conduct is within the scope of his or her employment or
              agency and the employer (A) having knowledge of such conduct,
              authorizes or ratifies such conduct, or (B) recklessly
              disregards such conduct.
                `(5) It is a defense to a prosecution under subsection
              (a)(1)(B) or (d), or under subsection (a)(2) with respect to
              the use of a facility for an activity under subsection
              (a)(1)(B) that a person--
                    `(A) has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective, and
                  appropriate actions under the circumstances to restrict or
                  prevent access by minors to a communication specified in
                  such subsections, which may involve any appropriate
                  measures to restrict minors from such communications,
                  including any method which is feasible under available
                  technology; or
                    `(B) has restricted access to such communication by
                  requiring use of a verified credit card, debit account,
                  adult access code, or adult personal identification number.
                `(6) The Commission may describe measures which are
              reasonable, effective, and appropriate to restrict access to
              prohibited communications under subsection (d). Nothing in this
              section authorizes the Commission to enforce, or is intended to
              provide the Commission with the authority to approve, sanction,
              or permit, the use of such measures. The Commission shall have
              no enforcement authority over the failure to utilize such
              measures. The Commission shall not endorse specific products
              relating to such measures. The use of such measures shall be
              admitted as evidence of good faith efforts for purposes of
              paragraph (5) in any action arising under subsection (d).
              Nothing in this section shall be construed to treat interactive
              computer services as common carriers or telecommunications
              carriers.
            `(f)(1) No cause of action may be brought in any court or
          administrative agency against any person on account of any activity
          that is not in violation of any law punishable by criminal or civil
          penalty, and that the person has taken in good faith to implement a
          defense authorized under this section or otherwise to restrict or
          prevent the transmission of, or access to, a communication
          specified in this section.
            `(2) No State or local government may impose any liability for
          commercial activities or actions by commercial entities, nonprofit
          libraries, or institutions of higher education in connection with
          an activity or action described in subsection (a)(2) or (d) that is
          inconsistent with the treatment of those activities or actions
          under this section:  <i> Provided, however </i> , That
          nothing herein shall preclude any State or local government from
          enacting and enforcing complementary oversight, liability, and
          regulatory systems, procedures, and requirements, so long as such
          systems, procedures, and requirements govern only intrastate
          services and do not result in the imposition of inconsistent
          rights, duties or obligations on the provision of interstate
          services. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude any State or
          local government from governing conduct not covered by this section.
            `(g) Nothing in subsection (a), (d), (e), or (f) or in the
          defenses to prosecution under subsection (a) or (d) shall be
          construed to affect or limit the application or enforcement of any
          other Federal law.
            `(h) For purposes of this section--
                `(1) The use of the term `telecommunications device' in this
              section--
                    `(A) shall not impose new obligations on broadcasting
                  station licensees and cable operators covered by obscenity
                  and indecency provisions elsewhere in this Act; and
                    `(B) does not include an interactive computer service.
                `(2) The term `interactive computer service' has the meaning
              provided in section <a href="#S230">230</a>(e)(2).
                `(3) The term `access software' means software (including
              client or server software) or enabling tools that do not create
              or provide the content of the communication but that allow a
              user to do any one or more of the following:
                    `(A) filter, screen, allow, or disallow content;
                    `(B) pick, choose, analyze, or digest content; or
                    `(C) transmit, receive, display, forward, cache, search,
                  subset, organize, reorganize, or translate content.
                `(4) The term `institution of higher education' has the
              meaning provided in section 1201 of the Higher Education Act of
              1965 (20 U.S.C. 1141).

          otherwise fully block the video and audio portion of such channel
          so that one not a subscriber to such channel or programming does
          not receive it.
            `(b) IMPLEMENTATION- Until a multichannel video programming
          distributor complies with the requirement set forth in subsection
          (a), the distributor shall limit the access of children to the
          programming referred to in that subsection by not providing such
          programming during the hours of the day (as determined by the
          Commission) when a significant number of children are likely to
          view it.
            `(c) DEFINITION- As used in this section, the term `scramble'
          means to rearrange the content of the signal of the programming so
          that the programming cannot be viewed or heard in an understandable
          manner.'.
            (b) EFFECTIVE DATE- The amendment made by subsection (a) shall
          take effect 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act.

<h4>`<a name="S230">SEC. 230.</a> PROTECTION FOR PRIVATE BLOCKING AND SCREENING OF
                            OFFENSIVE MATERIAL.</h4>
<pre>
            `(a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds the following:
                `(1) The rapidly developing array of Internet and other
              interactive computer services available to individual Americans
              represent an extraordinary advance in the availability of

                `(2) These services offer users a great degree of control
              over the information that they receive, as well as the
              potential for even greater control in the future as technology
              develops.
                `(3) The Internet and other interactive computer services
              offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse,
              unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad
              avenues for intellectual activity.
                `(4) The Internet and other interactive computer services
              have flourished, to the benefit of all Americans, with a

                `(3) to encourage the development of technologies which
              maximize user control over what information is received by
              individuals, families, and schools who use the Internet and
              other interactive computer services;
                `(4) to remove disincentives for the development and
              utilization of blocking and filtering technologies that empower
              parents to restrict their children's access to objectionable or
              inappropriate online material; and
                `(5) to ensure vigorous enforcement of Federal criminal laws

              computer service shall be held liable on account of--
                    `(A) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to
                  restrict access to or availability of material that the
                  provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious,
                  filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise
                  objectionable, whether or not such material is
                  constitutionally protected; or
                    `(B) any action taken to enable or make available to
                  information content providers or others the technical means
                  to restrict access to material described in paragraph (1).

<h3><a name="S551">SEC. 551.</a> PARENTAL CHOICE IN TELEVISION PROGRAMMING.</h3>
<pre>
            (a) FINDINGS- The Congress makes the following findings:
                (1) Television influences children's perception of the values
              and behavior that are common and acceptable in society.
                (2) Television station operators, cable television system
              operators, and video programmers should follow practices in
              connection with video programming that take into consideration
              that television broadcast and cable programming has established
              a uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of American children.
                (3) The average American child is exposed to 25 hours of
              television each week and some children are exposed to as much
              as 11 hours of television a day.
                (4) Studies have shown that children exposed to violent video
              programming at a young age have a higher tendency for violent
              and aggressive behavior later in life than children not so
              exposed, and that children exposed to violent video programming
              are prone to assume that acts of violence are acceptable
              behavior.
                (5) Children in the United States are, on average, exposed to
              an estimated 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of violence on
              television by the time the child completes elementary school.
                (6) Studies indicate that children are affected by the
              pervasiveness and casual treatment of sexual material on
              television, eroding the ability of parents to develop
              responsible attitudes and behavior in their children.
                (7) Parents express grave concern over violent and sexual
              video programming and strongly support technology that would
              give them greater control to block video programming in the
              home that they consider harmful to their children.
                (8) There is a compelling governmental interest in empowering
              parents to limit the negative influences of video programming
              that is harmful to children.
                (9) Providing parents with timely information about the
              nature of upcoming video programming and with the technological
              tools that allow them easily to block violent, sexual, or other
              programming that they believe harmful to their children is a
              nonintrusive and narrowly tailored means of achieving that
              compelling governmental interest.
            (b) ESTABLISHMENT OF TELEVISION RATING CODE-
                (1) AMENDMENT- Section 303 (47 U.S.C. 303) is amended by
              adding at the end the following:
            `(w) Prescribe--
                `(1) on the basis of recommendations from an advisory
              committee established by the Commission in accordance with
              section <a href="#S551">551</a>(b)(2) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
              guidelines and recommended procedures for the identification
              and rating of video programming that contains sexual, violent,
              or other indecent material about which parents should be
              informed before it is displayed to children:  <i>
              Provided,  </i> That nothing in this paragraph shall be
              construed to authorize any rating of video programming on the
              basis of its political or religious content; and
                `(2) with respect to any video programming that has been
              rated, and in consultation with the television industry, rules
              requiring distributors of such video programming to transmit
              such rating to permit parents to block the display of video
              programming that they have determined is inappropriate for
              their children.'.
                (2) ADVISORY COMMITTEE REQUIREMENTS- In establishing an
              advisory committee for purposes of the amendment made by
              paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Commission shall--
                    (A) ensure that such committee is composed of parents,
                  television broadcasters, television programming producers,
                  cable operators, appropriate public interest groups, and
                  other interested individuals from the private sector and is
                  fairly balanced in terms of political affiliation, the
                  points of view represented, and the functions to be
                  performed by the committee;
                    (B) provide to the committee such staff and resources as
                  may be necessary to permit it to perform its functions
                  efficiently and promptly; and
                    (C) require the committee to submit a final report of its
                  recommendations within one year after the date of the
                  appointment of the initial members.
            (c) REQUIREMENT FOR MANUFACTURE OF TELEVISIONS THAT BLOCK
          PROGRAMS- Section 303 (47 U.S.C. 303), as amended by subsection
          (a), is further amended by adding at the end the following:
            `(x) Require, in the case of an apparatus designed to receive
          television signals that are shipped in interstate commerce or
          manufactured in the United States and that have a picture screen 13
          inches or greater in size (measured diagonally), that such
          apparatus be equipped with a feature designed to enable viewers to
          block display of all programs with a common rating, except as
          otherwise permitted by regulations pursuant to section 330(c)(4).'.
            (d) SHIPPING OF TELEVISIONS THAT BLOCK PROGRAMS-
                (1) REGULATIONS- Section 330 (47 U.S.C. 330) is amended--
                    (A) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d); and
                    (B) by adding after subsection (b) the following new
                  subsection (c):
            `(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person shall ship
          in interstate commerce or manufacture in the United States any
          apparatus described in section <a href="#S303">303</a>(x) of this Act except in
          accordance with rules prescribed by the Commission pursuant to the
          authority granted by that section.
            `(2) This subsection shall not apply to carriers transporting
          apparatus referred to in paragraph (1) without trading in it.
            `(3) The rules prescribed by the Commission under this subsection
          shall provide for the oversight by the Commission of the adoption
          of standards by industry for blocking technology. Such rules shall
          require that all such apparatus be able to receive the rating
          signals which have been transmitted by way of line 21 of the
          vertical blanking interval and which conform to the signal and
          blocking specifications established by industry under the
          supervision of the Commission.
            `(4) As new video technology is developed, the Commission shall
          take such action as the Commission determines appropriate to ensure
          that blocking service continues to be available to consumers. If
          the Commission determines that an alternative blocking technology
          exists that--
                `(A) enables parents to block programming based on
              identifying programs without ratings,
                `(B) is available to consumers at a cost which is comparable
              to the cost of technology that allows parents to block
              programming based on common ratings, and
                `(C) will allow parents to block a broad range of programs on
              a multichannel system as effectively and as easily as
              technology that allows parents to block programming based on
              common ratings,
          the Commission shall amend the rules prescribed pursuant to section
          <a href="#S303">303</a>(x) to require that the apparatus described in such section be
          equipped with either the blocking technology described in such
          section or the alternative blocking technology described in this
          paragraph.'.
                (2) CONFORMING AMENDMENT- Section 330(d), as redesignated by
              subsection (d)(1)(A), is amended by striking `section <a href="#S303">303</a>(s),
              and section <a href="#S303">303</a>(u)' and inserting in lieu thereof `and sections
              <a href="#S303">303</a>(s), <a href="#S303">303</a>(u), and <a href="#S303">303</a>(x)'.
            (e) APPLICABILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATES-
                (1) APPLICABILITY OF RATING PROVISION- The amendment made by
              subsection (b) of this section shall take effect 1 year after

                    `(D) asks the caller for the card number;
                    `(E) clearly states that charges for the call begin at
                  the end of the introductory message; and
                    `(F) clearly states that the caller can hang up at or
                  before the end of the introductory message without
                  incurring any charge whatsoever.
                `(10) BYPASS OF INTRODUCTORY DISCLOSURE MESSAGE- The
              requirements of paragraph (9) shall not apply to calls from
              repeat callers using a bypass mechanism to avoid listening to
              the introductory message:  <i> Provided,  </i>
              That information providers shall disable such a bypass
              mechanism after the institution of any price increase and for a
              period of time determined to be sufficient by the Federal Trade
              Commission to give callers adequate and sufficient notice of a
              price increase.
                `(11) DEFINITION OF CALLING CARD- As used in this subsection,
              the term `calling card' means an identifying number or code
              unique to the individual, that is issued to the individual by a
              common carrier and enables the individual to be charged by
              means of a phone bill for charges incurred independent of where
              the call originates.'.
                (2) REGULATIONS- The Federal Communications Commission shall
              revise its regulations to comply with the amendment made by
              paragraph (1) not later than 180 days after the date of
              enactment of this Act.
                (3) EFFECTIVE DATE- The amendments made by paragraph (1)
              shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.
            (b) CLARIFICATION OF `PAY-PER-CALL SERVICES'-
                (1) TELEPHONE DISCLOSURE AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION ACT- Section
              204(1) of the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act
              (15 U.S.C. 5714(1)) is amended to read as follows:
                `(1) The term `pay-per-call services' has the meaning
              provided in section 228(i) of the Communications Act of 1934,
              except that the Commission by rule may, notwithstanding
              subparagraphs (B) and (C) of section 228(i)(1) of such Act,
              extend such definition to other similar services providing
              audio information or audio entertainment if the Commission
              determines that such services are susceptible to the unfair and
              deceptive practices that are prohibited by the rules prescribed
              pursuant to section <a href="#S201">201</a>(a).'.
                (2) COMMUNICATIONS ACT- Section 228(i)(2) (47 U.S.C.

          221) the following new section:
</pre>
<h4>`<a name="S222">SEC. 222.</a> PRIVACY OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION.</h4>
<pre>
            `(a) IN GENERAL- Every telecommunications carrier has a duty to
          protect the confidentiality of proprietary information of, and
          relating to, other telecommunication carriers, equipment
          manufacturers, and customers, including telecommunication carriers
          reselling telecommunications services provided by a
          telecommunications carrier.
            `(b) CONFIDENTIALITY OF CARRIER INFORMATION- A telecommunications
          carrier that receives or obtains proprietary information from
          another carrier for purposes of providing any telecommunications
          service shall use such information only for such purpose, and shall
          not use such information for its own marketing efforts.
            `(c) CONFIDENTIALITY OF CUSTOMER PROPRIETARY NETWORK INFORMATION-
                `(1) PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS-
              Except as required by law or with the approval of the customer,
              a telecommunications carrier that receives or obtains customer
              proprietary network information by virtue of its provision of a
              telecommunications service shall only use, disclose, or permit
              access to individually identifiable customer proprietary
              network information in its provision of (A) the
              telecommunications service from which such information is
              derived, or (B) services necessary to, or used in, the
              provision of such telecommunications service, including the
              publishing of directories.
                `(2) DISCLOSURE ON REQUEST BY CUSTOMERS- A telecommunications
              carrier shall disclose customer proprietary network
              information, upon affirmative written request by the customer,
              to any person designated by the customer.
                `(3) AGGREGATE CUSTOMER INFORMATION- A telecommunications
              carrier that receives or obtains customer proprietary network
              information by virtue of its provision of a telecommunications
              service may use, disclose, or permit access to aggregate
              customer information other than for the purposes described in
              paragraph (1). A local exchange carrier may use, disclose, or
              permit access to aggregate customer information other than for
              purposes described in paragraph (1) only if it provides such
              aggregate information to other carriers or persons on
              reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms and conditions upon
              reasonable request therefor.
            `(d) EXCEPTIONS- Nothing in this section prohibits a
          telecommunications carrier from using, disclosing, or permitting
          access to customer proprietary network information obtained from
          its customers, either directly or indirectly through its agents--
                `(1) to initiate, render, bill, and collect for
              telecommunications services;
                `(2) to protect the rights or property of the carrier, or to
              protect users of those services and other carriers from
              fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to,
              such services; or
                `(3) to provide any inbound telemarketing, referral, or
              administrative services to the customer for the duration of the
              call, if such call was initiated by the customer and the
              customer approves of the use of such information to provide
              such service.
            `(e) SUBSCRIBER LIST INFORMATION- Notwithstanding subsections
          (b), (c), and (d), a telecommunications carrier that provides
          telephone exchange service shall provide subscriber list
          information gathered in its capacity as a provider of such service
          on a timely and unbundled basis, under nondiscriminatory and

                  telecommunications service subscribed to by any customer of
                  a telecommunications carrier, and that is made available to
                  the carrier by the customer solely by virtue of the
                  carrier-customer relationship; and
                    `(B) information contained in the bills pertaining to
                  telephone exchange service or telephone toll service
                  received by a customer of a carrier;

                  classifications are assigned at the time of the
                  establishment of such service), or any combination of such
                  listed names, numbers, addresses, or classifications; and
                    `(B) that the carrier or an affiliate has published,
                  caused to be published, or accepted for publication in any
                  directory format.'.

            Section 224 (47 U.S.C. 224) is amended--
                (1) in subsection (a)(1), by striking the first sentence and
              inserting the following: `The term `utility' means any person
              who is a local exchange carrier or an electric, gas, water,
              steam, or other public utility, and who owns or controls poles,
              ducts, conduits, or rights-of-way used, in whole or in part,
              for any wire communications.';
                (2) in subsection (a)(4), by inserting after `system' the
              following: `or provider of telecommunications service';
                (3) by inserting after subsection (a)(4) the following:
                `(5) For purposes of this section, the term
              `telecommunications carrier' (as defined in section 3 of this
              Act) does not include any incumbent local exchange carrier as
              defined in section <a href="#S251">251</a>(h).';
                (4) by inserting after `conditions' in subsection (c)(1) a
              comma and the following: `or access to poles, ducts, conduits,
              and rights-of-way as provided in subsection (f),';
                (5) in subsection (c)(2)(B), by striking `cable television
              services' and inserting `the services offered via such
              attachments';
                (6) by inserting after subsection (d)(2) the following:
            `(3) This subsection shall apply to the rate for any pole
          attachment used by a cable television system solely to provide
          cable service. Until the effective date of the regulations required
          under subsection (e), this subsection shall also apply to the rate
          for any pole attachment used by a cable system or any
          telecommunications carrier (to the extent such carrier is not a
          party to a pole attachment agreement) to provide any
          telecommunications service.'; and
                (7) by adding at the end thereof the following:
            `(e)(1) The Commission shall, no later than 2 years after the
          date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, prescribe
          regulations in accordance with this subsection to govern the
          charges for pole attachments used by telecommunications carriers to
          provide telecommunications services, when the parties fail to
          resolve a dispute over such charges. Such regulations shall ensure
          that a utility charges just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory
          rates for pole attachments.
            `(2) A utility shall apportion the cost of providing space on a
          pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way other than the usable space
          among entities so that such apportionment equals two-thirds of the
          costs of providing space other than the usable space that would be
          allocated to such entity under an equal apportionment of such costs
          among all attaching entities.
            `(3) A utility shall apportion the cost of providing usable space
          among all entities according to the percentage of usable space
          required for each entity.
            `(4) The regulations required under paragraph (1) shall become
          effective 5 years after the date of enactment of the
          Telecommunications Act of 1996. Any increase in the rates for pole
          attachments that result from the adoption of the regulations
          required by this subsection shall be phased in equal annual
          increments over a period of 5 years beginning on the effective date
          of such regulations.
            `(f)(1) A utility shall provide a cable television system or any
          telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to any
          pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled by it.
            `(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a utility providing electric
          service may deny a cable television system or any
          telecommunications carrier access to its poles, ducts, conduits, or
          rights-of-way, on a non-discriminatory basis where there is
          insufficient capacity and for reasons of safety, reliability and
          generally applicable engineering purposes.
            `(g) A utility that engages in the provision of
          telecommunications services or cable services shall impute to its
          costs of providing such services (and charge any affiliate,
          subsidiary, or associate company engaged in the provision of such
          services) an equal amount to the pole attachment rate for which
          such company would be liable under this section.
            `(h) Whenever the owner of a pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way
          intends to modify or alter such pole, duct, conduit, or
          right-of-way, the owner shall provide written notification of such
          action to any entity that has obtained an attachment to such
          conduit or right-of-way so that such entity may have a reasonable
          opportunity to add to or modify its existing attachment. Any entity
          that adds to or modifies its existing attachment after receiving
          such notification shall bear a proportionate share of the costs
          incurred by the owner in making such pole, duct, conduit, or
          right-of-way accessible.
            `(i) An entity that obtains an attachment to a pole, conduit, or
          right-of-way shall not be required to bear any of the costs of
          rearranging or replacing its attachment, if such rearrangement or
          replacement is required as a result of an additional attachment or
          the modification of an existing attachment sought by any other
          entity (including the owner of such pole, duct, conduit, or
          right-of-way).'.

                    `(C) DEFINITIONS- For purposes of this paragraph--
                        `(i) the term `personal wireless services' means
                      commercial mobile services, unlicensed wireless
                      services, and common carrier wireless exchange access
                      services;
                        `(ii) the term `personal wireless service facilities'
                      means facilities for the provision of personal wireless
                      services; and
                        `(iii) the term `unlicensed wireless service' means
                      the offering of telecommunications services using duly
                      authorized devices which do not require individual
                      licenses, but does not mean the provision of
                      direct-to-home satellite services (as defined in
                      section <a href="#S303">303</a>(v)).'.

          of new telecommunications services that are dependent, in whole or
          in part, upon the utilization of Federal spectrum rights for the
          transmission or reception of such services. These procedures may
          establish a presumption that requests for the use of property,
          rights-of-way, and easements by duly authorized providers should be

            Section 332(c) (47 U.S.C. 332(c)) is amended by adding at the end
          the following new paragraph:
                `(8) MOBILE SERVICES ACCESS- A person engaged in the
              provision of commercial mobile services, insofar as such person
              is so engaged, shall not be required to provide equal access to
              common carriers for the provision of telephone toll services.
              If the Commission determines that subscribers to such services
              are denied access to the provider of telephone toll services of
              the subscribers' choice, and that such denial is contrary to
              the public interest, convenience, and necessity, then the
              Commission shall prescribe regulations to afford subscribers
              unblocked access to the provider of telephone toll services of
              the subscribers' choice through the use of a carrier
              identification code assigned to such provider or other
              mechanism. The requirements for unblocking shall not apply to
              mobile satellite services unless the Commission finds it to be
              in the public interest to apply such requirements to such
              services.'.

          encourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of
          advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans (including,
          in particular, elementary and secondary schools and classrooms) by
          utilizing, in a manner consistent with the public interest,
          convenience, and necessity, price cap regulation, regulatory
          forbearance, measures that promote competition in the local
          telecommunications market, or other regulating methods that remove
          barriers to infrastructure investment.
            (b) INQUIRY- The Commission shall, within 30 months after the

          the inquiry, the Commission shall determine whether advanced
          telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in
          a reasonable and timely fashion. If the Commission's determination
          is negative, it shall take immediate action to accelerate
          deployment of such capability by removing barriers to
          infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the
          telecommunications market.
