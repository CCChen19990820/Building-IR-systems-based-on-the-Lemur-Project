<title>1976 LP Campaign</title>

<h1>1976 Libertarian Presidential Campaign</h1>

<p>The 1975 <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
national convention nominated
<a href="/revolution/by_name/M/RogerMacBride.html">Roger MacBride</a>
for President and
<a href="/revolution/by_name/B/DavidBergland.html">David Bergland</a>
for Vice President. MacBride had become a libertarian celebrity when he
cast an electoral vote for the
<a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/election/1972/">1972 Libertarian
candidates</a> as a Republican presidential elector.
The Libertarian ticket was on 33 ballots, and won 173,011 votes (0.2%).</p>

<h2>The 1975 Convention</h2>

<p>Bergland remembers, "Roger brought political savvy, but a somewhat
limited understanding of the radical libertarian personality of the
delegates. This came to a head with the Vice Presidential nomination.
Two candidates for the position were not what Roger wanted. One, the late
(and great, in my view) John Vernon, was gay. The other, Jim Trotter, was a
gold smuggler. Well, that's all the delegates needed to go into an uproar
(rejecting MacBride's preference) and deadlock the convention because no one
of several candidates could get a majority. I was not then at the convention,
but was telephoned by friends, flew red-eye from L.A. to New York and was
nominated. Perhaps my most important qualification was being over 35. Not
many delegates attending were that old in 1975."</p>

<h2>The Campaign</h2>

<p><Cite>The Atlantic</cite> described MacBride's ideas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Libertarian platform this year swings so quickly from left to right that
it will give you nosebleed. Here's a list of what they propose to abolish:
preventive detention, tariffs, import quotas, no-fault insurance, involuntary
commitment to mental institutions, compulsory drug programs, government-funded
research, the FBI and the CIA, right-to-work laws, minimum wage laws,
government access to personal papers, antigun laws, compulsory arbitration,
antidiscrimination laws, deficit spending, the Federal Reserve, antitrust laws,
farm subsidies, wage and price and rent and profit and production and interest
ceilings, income taxation, regulation of energy resources, federal control of
the Post Office, the Environmental Protection Agency, safety-belt and
crash-helmet requirements, any restrictions at all on the sale or use of any
drugs whatsoever, compulsory education, public schools, taxes on private
schools, busing, child labor laws, the National Labor Relations Act, welfare,
government poverty programs, Medicare and Medicaid and any form of national
health insurance, the Professional Standards Review Board, building codes,
zoning, eminent domain, regional planning, urban renewal programs, the
Occupational Safety and Health Act, Social Security, the Civil Service system,
campaign finance laws, ballot restrictions, foreign aid, the Export-Import
Bank, laws restricting trade with any nation or organization by a private
citizen, national claims to offshore rights, overseas Army bases, our
involvement with NATO and SEATO and other alliances, the Monroe Doctrine,
presidential emergency powers, membership in the United Nations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MacBride wrote a book, <cite>New Dawn for America</cite>, to support his
campaign. (Every Libertarian presidential candidate through 1988 was an
author.)</p>

<p>MacBride campaigned extensively, especially in the West. In the
<cite>Saturday Evening Post</cite>, he wrote, "Early Americans ... struggling
for survival in a hard wilderness ... grasped somehow that they were free, that
no authority controlled them ... That truth released a burst of creative human
energy such as the planet had never known, and created the modern world. The
American libertarian revolution swept away absolutist regimes and beehive
societies of much of the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">European</a> world, teaching freedom."</p>

<p>According to Bergland, "Roger bought a DC-3 (World War II vintage two
engine prop plane for you youngsters) and had it outfitted to fly to
campaign stops. It was dubbed 'No Force One' by Ed Crane, the campaign
manager."</p>

<h2>The Results</h2>

<p>The Libertarian ticket was on 33 ballots, and won 173,011 votes (0.2% of
total), up from 2 ballots and 3,000 votes four years earlier. Voter
turnout was 54.4%. FEC certified $24,264,593.88 for matching funds for fifteen
Republican and Democratic candidates.</p>

<body>

<h1>1972 Libertarian Presidential Campaign</h1>

<p>The Libertarian Party was founded in December 1971 and ran its first
candidates for President in 1972.</p>

<p>Presidential candidate <a href="/revolution/by_name/H/JohnHospers.html">John
Hospers</a> and vice presidential candidate <a
href="/revolution/by_name/N/TonieNathan.html">Theodora "Tonie" Nathan</a>
were on the ballot in two states. They received 1,111 votes in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/co/">Colorado</a>,
1,537 in <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a>, and
43 write-in votes in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ma/">Massachusetts</a>
for a total of 2,691. (I have seen elsewhere the total reported as 3,671.)</p>

<p>Hospers and Nathan made history when Republican presidential elector
<a href="/revolution/by_name/M/RogerMacBride.html">Roger
MacBride</a> refused to cast his electoral vote for Richard Nixon and instead
voted for the Libertarians. This made Libertarian Tonie Nathan the first woman
ever to receive an electoral vote.</p>

<title>Ballot Access in New Hampshire</title>
<!-- Place: New Hampshire (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1992?3?4? -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Ballot Access in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire</a></h1>

<p>Four Libertarians were elected to the New Hampshire State House in 1992, a
record showing for the party. Part of their success was due to New Hampshire's
long-standing tradition of multiple party nominations. A candidate can be
nominated by more than one party, and appears on the ballot under each party's
label.</p>

<p>Three of the Libertarians were cross-nominated by the Republican Party and
one by the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>In response to Libertarian success, the New Hampshire legislature raised the
hurdles for third parties. Instead of listing multiply-nominated candidates
under each party heading, each such candidate appears only under the
candidate's party, with a small-print mention of cross-nominations under that
column.</p>

<title>'96 Libertarian Convention</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: report January 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Moving the Convention to '96</h1>

<h2>1994 Perspective</h2>

<p>January 3, 1994, from
<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/SteveGivot.html">Steve Givot</a>, responding
to criticisms from Bob Hunt,
of the LP-US's decision to move the presidential nominating convention from
1995 to 1996:</p>

<blockquote>
1. Was the "collective judgement" that we would still get our presidential
ticket on the ballot in all 50+DC states?
</blockquote>

<p>The LNC did not take a vote on this matter, so no one can say.  However, it
was the collective judgement of the LNC to move the convention to the summer of
1996, knowing that this posed some additional risk to 50+DC ballot access.  The
LNC also knew that we wouldn't have standing in court to sue the states which
pose a problem until we were under contract to have our convention in 1996.  So
it would be impossible to bring the issue of fair ballot access in these states
to court until we did so.</p>

<blockquote>
2. Was the "collective judgement" that a more "media timely" convention in
June/July 1996 more important than 50+DC ballot?
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the LNC did not vote on this particular issue.  However, media
timeliness and standing to file suit were among the several issues which argued
for the 1996 date.</p>

<blockquote>
3. Was any consideration given to a "media timely" convention compromise, such
as a 1996 convention shortly after the NH primary, ie. late Feb/early March?
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, this was considered both by the Convention Oversight Committee and
the LNC.  Please keep in mind that the LNC discussed this matter at many
meetings over the course of several years.  Dates as early as January,
1996 and as late as August, 1996, were discussed at various times.</p>

<blockquote>
4. Was any consideration given to our ballot status and our legal claims of
being treated unfairly, if there is a miracle and all of the states with a
early deadline agree with us and extend those deadlines to late August?
</blockquote>

<p>I don't understand your question.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of discussion of our ballot status and our legal
claims of being treated unfairly.  That discussion made it clear that we have
no standing to bring suit until we are affected by the law in the clearest of
terms, i.e. we have a convention scheduled which will make it impossible to
comply and gain ballot access.  Thus, gaining such legal standing required is
to pick a summer, 1996 date.</p>

<p>Did the LNC explicitly discuss miracles?  Of course not.  However, if there
is a miracle and every state which poses a problem for us changes its laws so
that we can hold a summer, 1996 convention without any increased ballot access
burden, then scheduling it for summer, 1996, will not pose any problem.  Ipso
facto, such a miracle (given that we are now scheduled for Summer, 1996, in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">DC</a>)
<em>will not</em> cause any incremental hardship to the LP.</p>

<p>Miracles are always welcomed by the LP.  However, we cannot sit idly by
under the burden of onerous ballot access laws which are getting no easier (in
most problem states), and wait for them to change.  We must force the issue,
and that is what the LNC has done.</p>

<blockquote>
Would we have the resources in 1996 to respond with a successful ballot drives
in all of those remaining states during approximately 5 to 6 weeks ending in
August?
</blockquote>

<p>That depends on what happens in court, doesn't it?  If we win in court, then
we might have very little burden at all.  For example, there are precedents
that say that if the petitioning time is shortened by 50%, then the signature
requirement is reduced by 50%.  I'd say that is a very, very positive
development for the LP!</p>

<p>If we lose in court, then we will have done our best to try to force
fairness, and we <em>may</em> miss out on being on the ballot in a few states. 
But this will only happen in 1996, not in 2000.  I personally think it is worth
gambling to bring about <em>major</em> ballot access reform if the downside is
missing a few states <em>once and only once</em>.  If we don't try, we will
<em>never</em> succeed, Bob.</p>

<blockquote>
Never mind that we might be successful in any <em>one</em> of the problem 
states. Would/Could we have the resources to be successful in all of the
problem states in a contracted short period of time simultaneously?
</blockquote>

<p>That depends on the resources available at that time.  If we have done the
other states with mainly volunteer signatures because our members want to save
a hoard of money to deal with possible court losses, then we may be alright. 
If we are not in a good position in the other states and we don't have a pile
of money as a contingency against court losses, then we are in trouble.</p>

<blockquote>
It is bad enough that there are so many serious obstacles in so many "problem
states" At least with a protracted ballot drive period, we can concentrate our
1.) ballot drive organizing experts, 2.) ballot law experts, 3.) lawyers for
ballot challenges, and 4.) signature collection experts; on one or two "problem
states" at a time. We all know of past cases where we had the signatures, but
some state had to be saved because some "form" was not notorized or turned in
on time.
</blockquote>

<p>Well, this changes none of that.  Remember, the purpose of setting the date
<em>now</em>, is that the convention (and most ballot drives) start two years
from now.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the LP planned on filing the first lawsuit
(<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a> State,
I believe) <em>today</em>! Yes, today, because we planned on
signing the convention contract today, which means that we have legal standing
to sue.  This gives us two years to find out where our problems are.  By
January, 1996, (and maybe much sooner) we should know which states we have lost
in court, have appeals heard, and know where we stand.</p>

<p>This allows the "experts" plenty of time to plan for highly accelerated
petition drives in a few places, if need be.  It also gives us time to raise
the money needed to do them, in the event that more money is needed.</p>

<p>As for the screwups of various petition drives in notarization, turning in
signatures, etc., I can only say that this decision should have no effect on
that so far as I can tell.  If anything, if we are left with a few states where
we have very few days to get lots of signatures, then the several months from
January, 1996, through the convention will give us an opportunity to make sure
that we have very competent people in those few places to assure that the
amateurism you referred to does not crop up there.</p>

<blockquote>
And what would be the effect of our future legal standing, if despite state law
changes, we were not able to get on the ballot in 50+DC?
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure I understand this question, but I'll have a go at answering
what I think you are asking.</p>

<p>If the courts force the "bad" states to change their laws and we still fail
to get on the ballot, then I have no idea as to what our "future legal
standing" is.</p>

<p>If the courts say:  "Tough luck, LP.  You knew the law before you schedule
your convention, so you created the problem,"  I would be amazed.  That would
be like telling a black person in the 60's that he/she created the problem by
insisting on sitting in the <em>front</em> of a city bus in the south. I can't
see that happening.</p>

<p>If the courts say:  "We will pro-rate the number of signatures required
based on the percentage of day remaining for petitioning, and guaranteeing a
minimum of (reasonable number of days) in any event," then we should be
ecstatic.  If we still fail to get the job done, the I presume that we would
have to either (1) assess whether or not (knowing the law for 2000) we could do
it the next time, (2) decide to make the convention date a bit earlier in 2000,
or (3) revert to a 1999 convention.  All of these options are open to us. 
Remember, this decision was for 95 vs 96 only.  No determination as been made
regarding any future convention dates.</p>

<blockquote>
I am worried about the effect of this (what I unfortunately think is a
premature) policy change.
</blockquote>

<p>I understand your worry.  I think that most LNC members who supported the
1996 date share some of it.</p>

<p>What concerns me is your use of the word "premature".  Making a commitment
to a date which gives us legal standing is <em>inherently risky</em>. Period.
If there were no risk, we would not have standing and would not have a court
case.  Ipso facto, we must be at risk to force the issue to the courts.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can tell me when it would not be "premature" to make such a
change for the purpose of forcing the issue to the courts.  I suggest that the
real issue is how much risk you (or the LNC) feels should be taken in order to
make a difference.</p>

<p>The LP itself is inherently a risky enterprise.  It, and its candidates,
spend millions for what is essentially very long shots at electing a few
candidates to local office (except in Alaksa and NH).  We spend about $1
million every four years with <em>no</em> chance whatsoever of electing a
president.  This isn't even a long shot - it is a non-shot.  But we do it
anyway.  Why?  Because we need to keep pushing the system to its limits in
order to budge it a bit.</p>

<p>That is all that this is doing.  50+DC is a big deal, but it is only a small
step toward electing a president, or even having a good enough showing to be
really noticed and "included" four years later.</p>

<p>That's why I think it is worth the risk.  I want to work towards winning. 
50+DC is <em>not</em> winning.  Changing the laws so that nearly half of our
resources and efforts don't have to be expended on ballot access <em>is</em>
worth doing, and <em>will</em> make it easier to have 50+DC forever.</p>

<h2>Early 1996 Perspective</h2>

<p>From a February 27, 1996 message to the LPUS mailing list by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/W/RichardWinger.html">Richard Winger</a>:</p>

<p>Having the Libertarian Party national presidential convention in July 
1996 instead of September 1995 is an experiment.  We won't be able to 
evaluate it until this calendar year is almost over.  I was in favor of 
this experiment, but so were plenty of other people.</p>

<p>I was in favor of it mostly because people who pay attention to 
politics will (in theory) think of the Libertarian Party as a "real" 
political party, if the LP imitates the Republicans and Democrats and 
nominates in the summer of the presidential election year, and also if 
the Libertarian Party uses its own presidential primaries to help it 
choose its nominee.</p>

<p>However, I know that the LP isn't yet in the same league with the Dems 
& Reps, and it may very well be that the practical advantages of an 
early convention will turn out to be greater, than the advantages of a 
summer of the election year convention.</p>

<p>But there have already been concrete gains, because of our decision to 
nominate in the summer of 1996.  Specifically, the states of Kentucky, 
Massachusetts, Ohio, Oklahoma, Virginia, Washington state, West 
Virginia, as well as D.C., all changed their laws (administratively or 
legislatively) to permit unqualified parties to petition, BEFORE that 
gorup has chosen its presidential candidate.  Furthermore, there are 
bills pending in the Iowa and New Hampshire legislature to authorize 
this.  Therefore, we can say that the Libertarian Party has contributed 
to political freedom.  These are gains not just for our freedom to 
maneuver, but for all non-established political parties freedom.  And I 
suspect there will be additional legal gains in this area, in the next 
few months.</p>

<p>Also, the summer 1996 convention date makes it possible for anyone 
seeking the Libertarian Party nomination to attempt to qualify for 
primary season matching funds.  Under the old schedule, this was 
literally impossible.  Obviously, the ability to qualify, is distinct 
of the question of whether to accept the money.  The ability to qualify 
is a gain, because it is a concrete marker of success that may come in 
handy later, relative to debates, etc.</p>

<title>Term Limits and Ballot Access</title>
<!-- Place: USA; Arkansas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: decision May 22, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Term Limits Ruling May Affect Ballot Access</h1>

<p>On May 22, 1995 the Supreme Court struck down the "term limits"
amendment to the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ar/">Arkansas</a> state
constitution. The court's justification may
give third parties an opportunity to challenge state ballot access laws, at
least in regards to federal office.</p>

<p>The Arkansas amendment did not actually limit terms, but instead prevented
any candidate who had previously served three terms in the U.S. House or
two terms in the U.S. Senate from being listed on the ballot (they could still
be elected as write-ins). The fact that this is called "term limits" shows
just how powerful ballot access is.</p>

<p>In <cite>U.S. Term Limits Inc. et al. v. Thornton et al.</cite>, Docket
93-1456, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that Section 3 of Amendment 73 to the
Arkansas Constitution violates the Federal Constitution.</p>

<p>The Court held that States are prohibited from imposing additional
qualifications for holding federal office because the offices are inherent
to the Constitution, and thus not in the realm of the Tenth Amendment.</p>

<p>In the majority opinion, Justice Stevens said, "Permitting individual States
to formulate diverse qualifications for their representatives would result in

<title>Jimmy Blake Campaign</title>
<!-- Place: Birmingham, Alabama (USA) -->
<!-- Time: November 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Libertarian Joins Birmingham City Council</h1>

<p>Dr. Jimmy Blake, chair of the Libertarian Party of Alabama, ran a successful
campaign for <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/al/Birmingham.html">Birmingham</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/al/">Alabama</a>, City Council
District 3. Although the race was
nonpartisan, Blake's Libertarian affiliation was brought up both by himself and
by his opponent.</p>

<p>The larger of Birmingham's two newspapers, the <cite>News</cite>
(circulation 170,000), endorsed Blake, while the smaller, the
<cite>Post-Herald</cite>, endorsed his opponent. The <cite>News</cite> praised
Blake for his energy and cautioned him to focus on local issues, a reference to
Libertarian national platform issues brought up by Blake's opponent.</p>

<p>The final (run-off) election votes were Jimmy Blake, 2906 (55.5%), and
Virginia Volker, 2332.</p>

<hr>

<p>Postscript: In 1996, Blake decided to run for U.S. Senate as a
Republican. We will see how receptive the old party is to new ideas.</p>

<title>Ballot Access in Arizona</title>
<!-- Place: Arizona (USA) -->
<!-- Time: law revamped late 1970's;
	lawsuit filed July 3, 1991; -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Ballot Access in Arizona</h1>

<p><A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a> toughened
its ballot access laws after Steve Davis, a Republican
Congressman, switched to the Libertarian Party in the mid-1970's, ran for
Congress as an independent, and came in a close second in a three-way race.</p>

<p>The state totally rewrote its election code, adopting a completely new Title
16 in the late 1970's.</p>

<p>Among the new code's provisions were minutely detailed specifications of a
political party's internal structure, such as who could vote for party
officers, when, where and how meetings were to be held, and so forth.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/H/ErnestHancock.html">Ernest Hancock</a>
mounted a legal challenge to the new code in 1991. He ran for
office as an independent in 1990 in order to gain standing to file the lawsuit,
and filed the federal lawsuit <cite>Hancock v. Symington, et al.</cite> on July
3, 1991.</p>

<p>Hancock's challenge was based on Supreme Court case law, the State
Constitution, and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution
supporting the claim that the State has no authority determining the internal
structure of a political party. Legal cases involved include <cite>Norman v.
Reed</cite>, <cite>Tashijan v. Republican Party of Connecticut</cite> and
<cite>Eu v. Democratic Party of San Francisco</cite>.</p>

<p>The lawsuit succeeded in changing Arizona law, particularly gaining a
statement by the Arizona Attorney General that the State cannot determine
internal party structure.</p>

<title>Arizona LP Turmoil</title>
<!-- Place: Arizona (USA) -->

</head>

<body>

<h1>Turmoil in the Arizona LP</h1>

<p>In early 1995, the Libertarian Party of Arizona was plunged into turmoil
when members of a county affiliate formed their own state party and attempted
to be recognized as such.</p>

<p>Members of the Pima County affiliate of the Libertarian Party of Arizona
took advantage of obscure provisions of the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a> election code.
The code
states that only elected precinct committeemen can run or vote for party
office. This rule is routinely ignored by all parties in Arizona, partly
because similar laws regulating internal party structure have been found
unconstitutional.</p>

<p>The breakaway group elected 13 precinct committeemen, and five of those
drove to
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/Phoenix.html">Phoenix</a>
to hold a "convention" according to state law. Those five
presumed to form a state party, elected officers and adopted bylaws, calling
themselves the Arizona affiliate of the Libertarian Party. Their bylaws gave
the state chair authority to appoint acting county chairs, thus giving their
small group complete control over party leadership.</p>

<p>The "new" Arizona Libertarian Party then told the Arizona Secretary of State
and the bank which held the state party's bank account that they were the
official party. The "existing" Arizona Libertarian Party appealed to the
Libertarian Party National Committee for a decision and reasserted control over
its bank account. The National Committee sided with the existing affiliate and
sent a letter to the "new" party to cease and desist using the Libertarian
Party name.</p>

<p>The letter signed by National Committee Chair <a
href="/revolution/by_name/D/SteveDasbach.html">Steve Dasbach</a> reads in
part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The political entity recognized by the Libertarian National Committee as our
affiliate party in Arizona is the "Arizona Libertarian Party", currently
chaired by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/T/RickTompkins.html">Rick Tompkins</a>.</p>

<p>Also according to our Bylaws, "No person, group or organization may use the
name 'Libertarian Party' or any confusingly similar designation except an
organization to which the [National Libertarian] Party grants affiliate party
status." [Article 8, Section 1.] The Libertarian National Committee remains
fully committed to enforcing this provision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the "new party" officers, Secretary Arthur Kerschen posted a "May
1995 status report" to LiberNet, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On January 28, 1995 new officers were elected to leadership positions in the
Arizona Libertarian party pursuant to Libertarian bylaws and Arizona law.
Elected were Dan Detaranto as Chairman, Arthur Kerschen as Secretary and Robert
Bushkin as Treasurer. The controversy arose when former Chairman Rick Tompkins
and other former state officers refused to acknowledge their removal from
office.</p>

<p>... Tompkins called a "convention" for April 29 and 30 in Phoenix in
conjunction with the Natcom meeting scheduled that same weekend ... The state
officers and John Zajac, a Pima County Libertarian activist, went to Phoenix on
March 21 to discuss the situation with Tompkins ...</p>

<p>... 321 Libertarians in Pima, Maricopa, Cochise and Yavapai Counties
contributed money to the Arizona Libertarian Party (to become Members of Record
under the bylaws) and authorized in writing before two witnesses that John
Zajac was instructed to vote on their behalf at this "convention". Proxy voting
is authorized by the bylaws only for Members of Record.</p>

<p>... the proxies were refused ... Police were called in to forcibly remove
Zajac and other Libertarians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In actuality, the breakaway Libertarians attended the Libertarian convention
apparently to cause such a disturbance. The 321 proxies, each of whom donated
$1 to become a member of record, were refused because the deadline had passed
for becoming a proxy in time for voting at the convention. The breakaways
disrupted the convention with frequent objections and outbursts until they were
ejected.</p>

<p>The May 1995 <cite>Libertarian Party News</cite>, in <img
src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.lp.org/lp/lpn/9505-Tompkins.html">"New Entry for '96?"</a>
reported Rick Tompkins' April 10 announcement to form an exploratory committee
to seek the Libertarian nomination for President. The article introduced
Tompkins as "long-time Libertarian activist and Arizona state party
chairman."</p>

<title>Membership Tips</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>San Diego Libertarians' Membership Success</h1>

<p>February 11, 1995, from <a
href="/revolution/by_name/R/RichardRider.html">Richard Rider</a>:</p>

<p>In response the the recent net query about how to get new members, the
following is a quick list of methods we use to do "outreach" in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/SanDiego.html">San Diego</a> (we
have the largest chapter in the nation):</p>

<ol>
<li>Letters to the editor--maybe the most important tactic we can use.  I
have a media packet available to those interested in learning more about this
invaluable tool.  Best bang for the buck, particularly with a computer fax
setup to broadcast letters (see below).
<li>Do all taxpayer ballot arguments, and stay active in both local and
state initiatives and propositions.
<li>Talk show calls.
<li>Public access TV show produced by local LP.
<li>Speakers bureau  for schools and civic groups.
<li>Testifying before city council and county board of supervisors.
<li>Computer fax broadcast system to deluge media and politicians with
Libertarian propaganda, letters, newspaper articles, libertarian publication
articles, etc.
<li>Local LP newsletter sent to Libertarians, media and potential allies.
<li>Work with other groups on allied issues (<a
href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">NRA</a>, tax groups, etc.)
<li>A manned phone line with quick response to info requests or soundbite
queries from media.
<li>Local BBS participation and a local email network.
<li>Mailings, primarily to old members and registered Libertarians who are
not now members.
<li>Set up batch of Libertarian books in public library and make sure they
are cross referenced under "libertarian".  Check out books occasionally so
that they will not pull books off the shelves.
<li>Provide information on variety of subjects from Libertarian viewpoint by
keeping available a file cabinet full of references organized by subject.
 Especially helpful on the drug issue.  Allow researchers to come to office
and make copies of needed source material (for a copying charge).
<li>Contact friendly letter to editor writers and send them info while
offering to help them distribute their letters via our fax system.
<li>Run candidates for partisan offices to educate the public and offer an
alternative.  Fill as many races as possible.  Big bucks campaigns not cost
effective.  We occasionally pull a candidate to help an exceptionally good
contender from an older party (normally Republican).
<li>April 15 post office tax protest.
<li>County fair outreach booth with political survey board and
questionnaires.
<li>Monthly supper club with guest speakers.  Try to get coverage of event
in local media, or at least an annoucement.
<li>Monthly LP nature hike.
<li>Get prominent members appointed to city and county boards, influencing
the boards' decisions and legitimizing the LP.
</ol>

<p>Probably more items, but that is all that comes to mind at the moment.</p>

<p>Bonnie Flickinger is the perfect example of what Libertarians can and
will do when elected to office. Flickinger won a seat on the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/MorenoValley.html">Moreno
Valley</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>
City Council in November 1992. The race was nonpartisan but
Flickinger is a registered
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian</a> and advocated
Libertarian goals during her campaign.</p>

<p>On December 14, 1993, by a 5-0 vote, the Moreno Valley City Council
appointed Flickinger as Mayor. Her one-year term began that night. Moreno
Valley, with a population of almost 140,000, is the largest city ever to
have a Libertarian mayor. Flickinger was re-elected to the City Council
in November 1994 and made Mayor Pro Tem in 1995.</p>

<p>Flickinger was nearly successful in repealing $7.5 million worth of
city taxes. In 1995, Flickinger tried to convince the city council to
allow residents to vote on the town's Utility Tax and Business Gross
Receipts Tax. She finally convinced enough members to get the measures
on the ballot, in exchange for voting for a unanimous resolution of
support for the taxes. On June 4, 1996, voters rejected both taxes
by a margin of 52% to 48%, and the taxes were scheduled to end
December 31, 1996. However, the taxes were placed on the ballot again
in November 1996, and passed.</p>

<p>After voting for the resolution, Flickinger announced she would not
campaign for or against the taxes but would correct any misinformation
put out by either side. Three other councilmembers denounced Flickinger,
threatening to censure her and remove her from appointed positions
including Mayor Pro Tem. Residents flooded Flickinger's office with
expressions of support.</p>

<title>Stadium Bonds</title>
<!-- Place: San Diego, California (USA) -->
<!-- Time: filed December 1995; tried February 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Libertarians Block Stadium Bonds</h1>

<p>Two Libertarians have filed suit against the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/SanDiego.html">San Diego</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>
City Council, arguing that the city must hold a vote on a proposed
$66 million bond issue for the San Diego Chargers football stadium.
The suit will be heard by a judge in February 1996.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/G/SteveGreen.html">Steve Green</a>, Chair
of the Libertarian Party of San Diego County,
California, and
<a href="/revolution/by_name/R/RichardRider.html">Richard Rider</a>,
1994 Libertarian candidate for governor
of California, say that since general tax funds guarantee the bonds
against default, the bond issue must be approved by a two-thirds vote
according to the state constitution.</p>

<p>The lawsuit is delaying the bond issue and the corresponding improvements
to the stadium. The two Libertarians have attracted a good bit of attention,
including a lengthy profile in the December 24, 1995 San Diego
<cite>Union-Tribune</cite>. Said the newspaper:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was Rider -- dismissed by the political establishment
as Libertarian wacko -- who challenged the 1988 half-cent sales-tax 
increase that would have paid for new jails in San Diego County. The 
California Supreme Court declared the tax illegal in 1991. The result: San 
Diego taxpayers will save an estimated $1.6 billion, while California 
taxpayers may save more than $8 billion on the precedent set by the case, 
which California Lawyer magazine rated a 'blockbuster.'</p>

<p>... It was Green who led the 1993 battle against [a previous] bond 
measure. The result: Voters overwhelmingly rejected the $18 million plan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While many consider the pair to be taxpayer heroes, City Council members
have called them "mean-spirited," "contemptible," and 
opposed "to anything that is really good for this community." Green
responded, "The issue is whether or not the California constitution
ought to be violated by the City Council going ahead without a vote of the 
people."</p>

$66 million San Diego bond issue," from the Libertarian Party.</p>

<h1>Libertarian Appointed to California Constitutional Convention</h1>

<p>In January 1996, longtime Libertarian activist and 1994 candidate
for governor <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/RichardRider.html">Richard
Rider</a> was appointed to the 21-member California Constitution
Revision Commission.</p>

<p>The commission recommends revisions to the California state
constitution. It is currently considering proposals to abolish
California's famous Proposition 13 limitations on property taxes
and the state's two-thirds vote requirement for new taxes.</p>

<p>Republican Curt Pringle, Speaker of the California Assembly, chose
Rider, well known for his opposition to tax and bond increases. Rider,
the only third-party member of the Commission, said, "In 
addition to pursuing my Libertarian desires for less government, I hope to 
represent the views of all third parties in terms of fair ballot access and 
representation in government."</p>

<p>In U.S. House races, there were more candidates on the ballot than usual,
with four- and five- way contests common, and even one six-way race. In 1994,
19 out of 30 Libertarian U.S. House candidates were in three-way races,
while in 1996 only 8 of the 42 candidates were in three-way races. This
resulted in a lower average vote total per candidate.</p>

<p>In the same election, voters approved measures prohibiting
affirmative action by state agencies and universities, and
legalizing marijuana for medical use.</p>

<p>Libertarians also ran in nonpartisan races:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calaveras County, California County Supervisor: Tom Tryon:
	re-elected</strong>
<li><strong>Tahoe City, California Public Utilities District Board, Director:
	Dennis Schlumpf: re-elected</strong>

<title>Bond Defeated</title>
<!-- Place: Atlanta, Georgia (USA) -->
<!-- Time: March 1994 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>Atlanta Bond Referendum Defeated</h1>

<p>From an article by Susan Laccetti in the March 10, 1994 Atlanta
<cite>Constitution</cite>, p. G3:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It may have been
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/Atlanta.html">Atlanta</a>
mayor Bill Campbell who pulled the plug on the city's
$149 million bond referendum, but it probably wouldn't have happened without
the dogged persistance of lawyer Bob Proctor, 35.</p>

<p>"My personal objective is to reduce the role of government in our world,"
said the self described Libertarian.</p>

<p>Not only was he the attorney who filed suit against the special bond
election
scheduled for tuesday, but he ... led the 1991 taxpayer revolt.</p>

<p>Proctor is state chair of the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a>
Association of Taxpayers, a 10,000
member group that filed suit and stopped the tax on private sales of
automobiles. That case resulted in 150,000 refunds to Georgia taxpayers last
fall.</p>

<title>1994 Georgia Governor Race</title>
<!-- Place: Georgia (USA) -->
<!-- Time: concessions offered April 1994 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>Republicans Offer Concessions to Libertarians</h1>

<p>From posts April 17 and 19, 1994, by <a
href="/revolution/by_name/T/MikeTanner.html">Mike Tanner</a>:</p>

<p>An extraordinary meeting took place last week between representatives of the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a> Libertarian
Party and the leading Republican candidates for governor.
The Republicans, who either personally attended or sent their campaign
managers, met with <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/NancyLord.html">Dr. Nancy
Lord</a>, <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/CaroleRand.html">Carole Ann Rand</a>,
and the LP's legal counsel.</p>

<p>The Republicans admitted that they were afraid that the presence of an LP
candidate in the governor's race would cost them the election.  They offered a
variety of consessions, including changes in ballot access laws and a signed
pledge to oppose any tax increase, if the LP would not run a candidate for
governor.  However, the Republicans refused to make any concessions on the drug
war or other social issues. As a result, the LP turned down the deal and
<em>will</em> run a candidate for governor.  Obviously the LP-Georgia is
beginning to become a political force.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The Georgia Republican Party has come back with a further list of
concessions in an effort to reach an agreement whereby the Georgia LP will not
run a candidate for governor.  The latest offer includes an agreement that the
Republicans will not run a candidate for Agriculture commissioner (leaving the
LP one-on-one against the Democrat in a statewide race) and a public statement
that ending drug prohibition is a "legitimate topic for public debate."  These
guys must really be scared of us.  Stay tuned for further developments.  [By
the way, I have been advised that LP State Chair Cosmo Boyd, <cite>Georgia
Libertarian</cite> editor Jack Aiken, and LNC Member <a
href="/revolution/by_name/C/RonCrickenberger.html">Ron Crickenberger</a> also
attended the negotiations.]</p>

<title>Libertarian Elected</title>
<!-- Place: Avondale Estates, Georgia (USA) -->
<!-- Time: November 7, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Libertarian elected to city commission</h1>

<p>On November 7,1995, Libertarian Party of Georgia member Bruce Van Buren
won election to the Avondale Estates City Commission, placing first in a
field of five candidates vying for two open seats in a nonpartisan race.</p>

<p>Avondale Estates is a "planned community." It has the second highest
median income of any <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a> city.</p>

<p>According to campaign manager <a
href="/revolution/by_name/C/RonCrickenberger.html">Ron Crickenberger</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... much was made of Bruces party affiliation by the other candidates,
including 11th hour hit pieces describing all the LP positions people
usually talk about when one of our candidates has them running scared.</p>

<p>... The campaign spent about $2,200.00 to win 428 votes. Turnout was high
at over 55%. We put five pieces of literature into every household.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A pre-walk card that we mailed out in batches just large enough to be
covered by each weeks walk. The card simply had Bruce's picture with a short
note saying "I'm coming by to talk to you about city issues."  It serves as a
great time saver for the candidate, and commits him to a certain number of
doors per week.</p></li>

<li><p>A standard candidate issue card. Bruce knocked on every door in the
1,177 home city to hand deliver this card and chat with everyone who was
home.</p></li>

<li><p>An issue letter. The one issue in the campaign, other than Bruces party
affiliation, was restoring the main Tudor Village Building. One candidate had
proposed for the city to buy the building. We polled the electorate with the
question "would you be more likely to vote for a candidate who wanted the city
to buy the Tudor Village with tax increases, or one who wanted the city to
more aggressively pursue private investors?"  Our guys position was a ten-to-one
favorite, so the letter quite naturally stressed this heavily.</p></li>

<li><p>A "good guy" postcard designed to hit the Saturday before the election.
We also reinforced the message about our position on the Tudor Village.</p></li>

<li><p>A last minute endorsement letter signed by 35 members of the community.
We put this out when we found out about the hit pieces charging Bruce with
wanting vending machines filled with drugs, guns and prostitutes in the
elementary school. We found out about the hit pieces on Sunday afternoon, got
signatures of prominent people for a couple of hours, put the piece together
till 1:00AM, got it printed at Kinkos and distributed to every home in the
city by 5:00PM Monday.</p></li>
</ol>

<P>We also made at least two dialings to  every household in the city, and
identified over two hundred Van Buren supporters for a Monday night GOTV
effort.</p>

<body>

<h1>Libertarian elected to city commission</h1>

On November 7, 1995, Libertarian Party of Georgia member Dewayne Methaney won
a seat on the
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/Auburn.html">Auburn</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ga/">Georgia</a>,
City Commission, placing second in a field
of six candidates vying for two spots. Methaney's campaign in the nonpartisan
race was managed by Libertarian Party campaigner Larry Bolin.</p>

<p>LP State Chair Montague Boyd reported that, "In a last ditch effort, the
Democratic machine sent out an unsigned letter comparing Libertarians to
Howard Stern. This smear campaign failed because Dewayne had a positive
message that resonated with the voters of Auburn."</p>

<title>Givot for Senate 1984</title>

<body>

<h1>Givot for Senate</h1>

<p>In 1984,
<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/SteveGivot.html">Steve Givot</a> ran for
U.S. Senate in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a>. In defending
another campaign's hard efforts against armchair quarterbacks later in 1996,
Givot described his campaign:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My 1984 senate campaign raised $125,000, got five major national
endorsements from conservative/Republican bigwigs (not counting then-sitting
Congressman
<a href="/revolution/by_name/P/RonPaul.html">Ron Paul</a> and the
Chief Economist of Chase Manhattan Bank).</p>

<p>I was hounded by the media for interviews after the endorsements.  I
appeared on virtually every television station in the state -- at their
behest.  I flew more than 50,000 miles to blanket Illinois during the
campaign.  I testified before the Joint Economic Committee of the U. S.
Congress.</p>

<p>I stopped working and campaigned full time -- at least 5 days each week
-- from April 1.</p>

<p>The result:  about 60,000 votes (roughly 1.25%).</p>

<title>Illinois Ballot Access</title>
<!-- Place: Illinois (USA) -->
<!-- Time: February 7, 1996 -->
</head>
<body>

<h1>Court Denies Local Ballot Access</h1>

<p>On February 7, 1996, the federal court in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a> denied ballot
access to the <a href="index.html">Libertarian Party of Illinois</a>
in local races even though the party had won statewide ballot access.</p>

<p>As a result of the November 1994 general election, the LP-Illinois
became an "established party" under the Illinois Election Code. The state
board of elections at first confirmed LP-Illinois could participate in
the primary election for all statewide and local offices, in a December 13,
1994 letter from A. L. Zimmer, General Counsel of the State Board of
Elections to Andrew Spiegel, General Counsel of LP-Illinois.</p>

<p>Shortly after confirming the established party status of LP-Illinois, the
state board changed its mind and determined LP-Illinois could only run
candidates in statewide races. Reversal of their previous confirmation
came in a December 19, 1994 letter from Zimmer to Spiegel.</p>

<p>In <cite>Libertarian Party of Illinois, et al., vs. Wanda L. Rednour,
et al.</cite>, the LP-Illinois argued that certain state ballot access
requirements were unconstitutional. The state argued the restrictions were
necessary to prevent "voter confusion," that the addition of Libertarian
candidates would "clutter" the ballot, and that it was constitutional
to require LP-Illinois candidates to obtain over ten times the number
of signatures required of Republican and Democratic candidates.</p>

<p>In February 1996, the court agreed with the state. Libertarian candidates
may be listed on the ballot for statewide races (President and U.S. Senate
in 1996), but not for local races (including Congressional and state
legislature races in 1996). Candidates for local races must petition to
be on the ballot as if they were candidates of a newly formed party.
LP-Illinois is deciding whether to appeal the decision.</p>

<p>Oh, God forbid the voters have a real choice, that would <em>clutter
the ballot</em>. We can't let voters <em>really</em> decide who gets
elected; they're too easily confused. It's just so embarassing when
a new party overcomes the obstacles placed in front of ballot access;
we didn't really mean we'd let you on the ballot. Sorry, we changed
the rules.</p>

<h1>Phone System Helps Party</h1>

<p>Posted March 20, 1996 to LPUS by James D. Solomon
(<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:solomon@comm.mot.com">solomon@comm.mot.com</a>),
Corresponding Secretary of the
<a href="index.html">Libertarian Party of Illinois</a>:</p>

<p>The Illinois LP installed a new voice-mail system about a month ago
and in my opinion it has been a resounding success.  Many thanks to
Washington State activist,
<A href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a>,
for his <a href="/revolution/politics/strategy/tips/">"tips"</a>,
<a href="/revolution/politics/strategy/tips/phone.html">one of
which</a> provided the idea behind our voice mail system.</p>

<p>By replacing our "rollover line" with Amertech's "Enhanced Voice Mail
for Small Business", we actually are saving money on our phone bills.
In addition, our response time to inquiries has gone from days/weeks
down to minutes/hours, because messages can be retrieved from any
phone at any time, regardless of location.  Our outgoing message also
lists our state chair's pager number for "urgent" messages.  It's
amazing how much more likely you are to get press coverage when you
return reporters' phone calls in short order!</p>

<p>If you would like to see how we've organized our mailbox,
call (847) 776-8090 and select one or more of the options.
Please feel free to Email me for further information.</p>

	(47.6%, winner of one of six slots)</strong>
<li>Sylvan Township Trustee: James L. Hudler: 387 votes (20.8%)
<li>Ypsilanti Township Trustee: Geoffrey Foster: 2,567 votes (24.1%)
</ul>

<p>The two winning candidates won by default. Brian Wisneski was one of
two candidates running for Clinton Township Trustee, in which the top
two get elected (however, he did beat a Republican write-in challenger).
Brett Cashman was one of four candidates running for Superior Township Park
Commissioner, in which the top six get elected.
Regardless of the electoral significance of these positions, having
officeholders of any type increases the party's respect and builds
experience for future higher office.</p>

<p>In the same election, voters approved a ballot initiative to legalize
limited casino gambling in Detroit.</p>

<p>Libertarians also ran in some nonpartisan races:</p>
<ul>
<li>Justice of the Supreme Court: Jerry J. Kaufman: 314,834 votes (6.1%)
<li>Justice of the Supreme Court: David Raaflaub: 85,714 (1.7%)
</ul>

<p>The vote totals for the Libertarian presidential ticket in Michigan
were about 50% more than required to retain ballot status, which the
state party now has through the 1998 elections.</p>

<title>Coon for State House</title>
<!-- Place: -->
<!-- Time: -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Jon Coon for State House</h1>

<p>One of 1996's most promising Libertarian campaigns was
Jon Coon's race for State Representative in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan's</a>
24th District. Building on the contacts and name recognition gained by his
<a href="joncoon/">1994 U.S. Senate campaign</a>, Coon gained the
endorsement of the NRA, ran radio ads for the
<a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/election/1996/browne/">Harry
Browne campaign</a>, out-spent and out-campaigned his opponent, and
sent campaign videos to every registered voter in the district.</p>

<p>Coon came in a distant second, with 4,942 votes (15.4%), ahead of
the Republican but behind the five-term Democractic incumbent.</p>

<h2>NRA Endorses Libertarian</h2>

<p>In September 1996, the <a href="index.html">Libertarian Party of Michigan</a>
announced that the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">National Rifle Association</a>
had endorsed Coon. The NRA sent out "voter alert" postcards
to all its members in the 24th district announcing the endorsement.</p>

<p>This was the first time the NRA endorsed a Libertarian
candidate for state office in Michigan.</p>

<h2>State Party Runs Radio Ads</h2>

<p>The <a href="index.html">Libertarian Party of Michigan</a> Campaign Fund
raised $10,000 to support the Browne for President campaign with radio
commercials. The party purchased one spot per show per day on virtually all
of the talk radio stations in the state in late October and early November.</p>

<p>The party ran three ads, two produced by the Harry Browne campaign
and one specially produced, and narrated by Jon Coon. The Coon ad was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>COON:</b> For far too long now the two older parties have whipsawed us
into voting for "the lesser of two evils" by claiming that casting your ballot
for anyone else was "wasting your vote."  Hi, I'm Jon Coon, here to tell you
that the time has come to put an end to this by voting for Harry Browne, the
Libertarian party candidate for president.  By voting for Harry you do two
things.  First, you send a message that you want less government.  Not
government that doesn't grow as fast.  Less government.  And, second, if
enough people vote for Harry Browne, we will make the Libertarian party a
major party in Michigan and end the two-party stranglehold.  So, ask
yourself.  Do you want Clinton's 20% increase in government?  Dole's 14%
increase in government?  Or do you want what Browne calls his "great trade":</p>

<p><b>BROWNE:</b> "Would you give up your favorite federal programs if it meant
you'd never have to pay income tax again?  I'm Harry Browne, Libertarian
candidate for president."</p>

<p><b>COON:</b> To me, the choice is clear.</p>

<p><b>BOOTH:</b> Paid for by the Libertarian Party of Michigan Campaign
Fund.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Campaign Video</h2>

<p>At a cost of $10,000, the Jon Coon campaign produced a professional
eighteen minute campaign video created mostly from a three-camera shoot
of a speech Jon made at a campaign-sponsored Town Hall meeting in
August 1995. The campaign made 23,000 copies of the video at a cost of
$20,000.</p>

<p>The last weekend in October, in a monumental effort reported in the local
media, the "Coon Platoon" of nearly 100 volunteers delivered a copy of
this video to every registered voter household in the district, except
apartment buildings. The campaign mailed videos to much of the remaining
apartment addresses.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>Of interest is how the campaign was run. From the campaign's advertising
director, Tim O'Brien:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We decided early on that we would not run on "issues." Neither major party
runs on issues ...  Further, Libertarian positions on most issues are,
at least, apparently, very radical.  Our goal was not to spend our time,
effort and money in a (very likely futile) attempt to educate the public
on the efficacy of libertarian ideas but, rather, to get Jon Coon elected.</p>

<p>... Our strategy was to take the high road.  No personal attacks on
Palamara. In fact, we conceded that he was nice guy.  But because he belongs
to one of those two major parties, <em>he</em> is impotent to get anything
done.  It was the simple and easily understood message that the two party
system has become the problem because special interest groups have discovered
they can get whatever they want by simply contributing to both sides. And
that <em>only</em> a third party -- without political debts -- can solve
this problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The national Libertarian Party supported and promoted the Coon
campaign as one of the winnable campaigns of the season. There have been
postmortem criticisms of this strategy, the main ones being concerned
with running against a five-term incumbent in a "safe"
one-party district and avoiding hard-code libertarian issues.</p>

<title>Miriam Luce</title>
<!-- Place: New Hampshire (USA) -->
<!-- Time: appointment announced August 24, 1993 -->

<h1>Governor Appoints Libertarian to Liquor Commission</h1>

<p>From Eric Werme USSG (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:werme@zk3.dec.com">werme@zk3.dec.com</a>):</p>

<p>On August 24th, 1993, Governor Steve Merrill(R) of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire</a> announced
his intent to appoint Libertarian Miriam Luce to the state's liquor commission.
 She will replace a Democrat who was forced to step down for using his
influence
as a member of Manchester, New Hampshire's police commission to get a liquor
broker's arrest for DWI reduced to speeding.</p>

<p>The state liquor board has three commissioners, and state rules mandate
that the board must not be composed of members of a single political
party.  The other two commissioners are Republicans, and all the
speculation on who would be appointed to the spot centered on Democrats.</p>

<p>The early coverage I've seen has been positive from politicians, including
the
Democrats.  This may have something to do with the Democrats saying that
the commission should be privatized (I assume because they've always been
in the minority on the board), and Luce also has supported privatizating
the board in her gubernatorial campaigns in 1992 and 1990.  The head of the
state employee's union and some of the liquor brokers are more concerned
about what Luce's impact may be.</p>

<p>Luce promises to leave her philosophical views are the commission door.
Candidate Luce: "State government has become the supreme vice lord of New
Hampshire, running liquor stores and lotteries.. It is time these industries
were allowed to rise and fall in the private sector."  Nominee Luce: "I am
not a revolutionary. ... I was a candidate then, I have been nominated for
a position now and that position is managerial.  There is no preconceived
notion about what can or should be done and I mean that."</p>

<p>Governor Merrill: "What I would like to do is take a fresh look at how we
can deliver more for less."</p>

<p>As for commissioner Luce, that requires approval of the five member
executive council which will decide in two weeks.  The only councilor
to speak against Luce in public was Raymond Burton(R), who said that the
nominee should have come from the North Country.  Burton's district is
northern New Hampshire.</p>

<p>Luce is a management consultant and a graduate of Dartmouth's Tuck Business
School.  Her management background includes a multimmillion dollar operation in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York
City</a>, which she left to return to the friendlier confines of New
Hampshire.</p>

<h2>Libertarian to Join Liquor Commission</h2>

<p>August 26, 1993, from David Eagle (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:David.Eagle@f174.n132.z1.fidonet.org">David.Eagle@f174.n132.z1.fidonet.org</a>):</p>


<p>Concord, NH - In what has been heralded by state Libertarian leaders as
the biggest single breakthrough for the party thus far, two-time
Libertarian gubernatorial candidate Miriam Luce of Windham has been
picked by New Hampshire Governor Steve Merrill to replace a scandal-tainted
member
of the state's three-person Liquor Commission.  If confirmed, Luce's
nomination would mark the first appointment of a Libertarian to a
statewide office in the United States.</p>

<p>  "I'm choosing a woman of talent and ability," Merrill said at an
August 24th State House new conference, one day before officially
nominating Luce.  The official nomination will take place at the 
August 25th meeting of the state Executive Council, which approves or 
rejects all gubernatorial nominations.  Merrill called attention to
Luce's interest and expertise in marketing, her managerial skills,
her MBA from Dortmouth's Amos Tuck School of Business Administration,
and her "outstanding integrity and outstanding competence."  Merrill
said he got to know Luce during last year's gubernatorial campaign,
when he had "debated her, and on occasion been whupped by her."</p>

<p>  "One of the hardest calls I ever made was the call to Miriam Luce
to ask if she would accept this nomination."  Merrill said he
realized that Luce was "not necessarily the greatest spokesman" for
state bureaucracy.  "And I have an idea that Miriam Luce's high
school yearbook has no caption under her picture which says 'hopes
to grow up to be a liquor commissioner'."</p>

<p>  Luce said she "was genuinely surprised" nearly two weeks earlier
when she got a call from Merrill.  "After due consideration and
consultation I decided to accept the Governor's nomination."  Luce
said she would enter the position, if confimed, "with no preconceived
notions," and would apply herself to learning the job.  She said her
nomination "endorses the notion that we have brought to the
marketplace of ideas some concepts that have merit, and are worth
examining and possibly implementing."  She called New Hampshire
"arguably the most Libertarian state in the country."</p>

<p>  Luce, who ran against Merrill and Democrat Deborah "Arnie"
Arneson in 1992, first won major party status for New Hampshire
Libertarians with her 5% vote showing in the 1990 race for 
Governor.  The fact that during her two campaigns for Governor
Luce said repeatedly that the state should get out of the liquor
business, calling state government, with its liquor and gambling
monopolies, "the biggest vice-lord in the state," led some in the
media and in state government to suppose that her nomination is
intended as a first step toward privatizing state liquor stores.
But state Libertarian Party chair Doug Harrigan said people must
realize that Libertarians have no illusion that their philosophy
can be implemented at once.  "Pragmatically, you have to have
consensus before you can effect change," he said.</p>

<p>  Luce, 44, is a former International Paper Company manager and
commissioned securities dealer.  If confirmed, Luce could begin
serving her 6-year term as Commissioner soon after out-going Roger
Boisvert's planned September 17th departure from office.  The
full-time, business-heavy workload of the $45,088 - $57,824/yr.
post might leave Luce no time for either of her two current weekly
radio talk shows.  Reporters suggested the commission job might also
serve to conveniently keep Luce from mounting another campaign
against Merrill for Governor next year.  But in spite of her growing
and politically valuable radio listenership, Luce had previously
said she would not run again for Governor.</p>

<p>  Although Luce's nomination to a previously Democrat-held office
might understandably have disappointed them, leading House Democrats
gave a ringing endorsement of Merrill's choice.  Assistant Democratic
whip Peter Burling called Luce "extraordinarily competent, intelligent and
introspective -- a really good appointee.  She would fit well into
our look at downsizing the commission."  House Democratic Leader Rick
Trombly called on Merrill to "retain Ms. Luce as the sole liquor commissioner
once [Democratic] legislation becomes law.  We firmly believe that he should
have his appointee in office when the streamlined liquor commission comes into
being."  Trombly also said he "would like to welcome the Libertarian Party
into their new active role in the administration of state government.  They
have proven themselves as legislators.  We look forward to their success in
the administration."</p>

<p>  Not all had good things to say about the Luce appointment, however.  Chris
Henchey, chief negotiator for the NH State Employees Association said that
while Luce is certainly qualified, "our concern is one of privatization.  We
need to get a real close look at this nominee, given the Libertarian
foundations -- their tendency to want to dismantle government.  There's some
real question about balance -- the Tuck MBA versus the strong campaign stands
she took."</p>

<p>State Libertarian Party spokesmen were clearly elated by Luce's nomination.
</p>

<p>"I think the Governor made an absolutely brilliant move in appointing
Miriam,"
said House Libertarian Leader
<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/DonGorman.html">Don Gorman</a> (L-Deerfield).
 "This action is
sending out more damned messages to more major players than you can believe. 
The fact that the Governor recognizes the usefulness of a Libertarian in this
role demonstrates not only his political savvy, but the fact that we have
advanced in stature to the point where a governor would feel comfortable
associating with us in this fashion.  Miriam's appointment should certainly be
the death-knell for the word 'bi-partisan' in this state, and we can thank
Steve Merrill for recognizing that New Hampshire is truly  tri-partisan'!"</p>

<p>  Harrigan said Merrill had "simultaneously shaken up the political
establishment, helped legitimize the Libertarian Party, and put legislators on
notice that he thinks the Libertarian small-government philosophy has a place
in state government.  It's a big day for us -- at least as big as placing an
official Libertarian delegation in the House in last year's election."</p>

<h1>Three New Hampshire Libertarians Elected</h1>

<p>Three Libertarians were elected in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire's</a>
March 12, 1996 local elections. The victories show the
<a href="index.html">Libertarian Party of New Hampshire's</a> commitment
to building the party through grassroots efforts and gaining
candidate experience.</p>

<p>The winning Libertarians were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>John Lamb, Libertarian Party county coordinator for Rockingham County,
was the top vote-getter in the race for the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/Plaistow.html">Plaistow</a>,
New Hampshire Planning Board, winning a one-year term.</p>

<li><p><a href="/revolution/by_name/E/JeffEmery.html">Jeff Emery</a>,
Chair of the Libertarian Party of New Hampshire, was elected to a six-year
term to the nonpartisan office of Supervisor of the Checklist in 
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/Plaistow.html">Wentworth</a>,
New Hampshire.</p>

<p>"One of the reasons why we've been successful in New Hampshire is
... we are willing to start at the bottom, learn the process, and move up
the political ladder," said Emery of the three wins.</p>

<li><p>John Babiarz was elected Cemetery Trustee in 
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/Plaistow.html">Grafton</a>,
New Hampshire.</p>

<title>Gorman Runs For Speaker</title>
<!-- Place: announcement Concord, New Hampshire (USA) -->
<!-- Time: announcement May 1, 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Libertarian Legislator Seeks Speaker Role</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian</a> state
legislator
<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/DonGorman.html">Don Gorman</a> announced
in May 1996 that he is running for Speaker
of the <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire</a>
House. The 400-member House will elect a new speaker in mid-December 1996.</p>

<p>Gorman's strategy is to assemble a coalition of Democrats, who lack
the votes to elect one of their own as Speaker; disaffected Republicans;
and any new Libertarian legislators elected in November. If elected,
Gorman promises to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Give the State & Federal Relations Committee "the new charge of 
ending unconstitutional Federal mandates.
<li>"Create a Sunset Committee to reduce and streamline our cluttered 
and cumbersome RSAs [state laws.]"
<li>"Strengthen the involvement and participation of every member."
</ul>

<p>Gorman has spent eight years as a member of the N.H. House; 1993 to 
1996 as a Libertarian, and 1973 to 1976 as a Republican.</p>

<title>Libertarians End Roadblocks</title>
<!-- Place: New Hampshire -->
<!-- Time: passed by house March 1996;
	passed by senate April 1996;
	in effect June 11, 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Libertarian Helps End Roadblocks</h1>

<p>In June 1996, a
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian</a>-sponsored law
ended random drunk-driving roadblocks in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire</a>.</p>

<p>House Bill 1285, introduced by State Representative
<A href="/revolution/by_name/G/DonGorman.html">Don Gorman</a>
(L-Deerfield), requires police to get permission from a judge before 
setting up drunk-driving roadblocks, and requires the judge to affirm that 
"all constitutional guarantees are met." The bill passed the state house
in March, and the state senate in April. It became law after the governor
neither signed nor vetoed the bill within five days.</p>

<p>"Roadblocks of this type infringe on the right of law-abiding citizens
to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The New Hampshire State
Constitution, as interpreted by the State Supreme Court (<cite>State vs.
Koppel</cite>, 1985) clearly indicates that New Hampshire residents are
entitled to greater protection against these types of 'no-reason' stops
than is provided for in the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution," Gorman
said.</p>

<p>"During a six-month period, the Concord police department conducted 47
checkpoints, making 1,680 stops and 18 arrests for Driving While
Intoxicated. During the same period, routine patrols using traditional
methods arrested 175 for DWI. Clearly, the checkpoints are ineffective as well
as unconstitutional."</p>

<title>1996 New Hampshire Elections</title>
<!-- Place: New Hampshire (USA) -->
<!-- Time: November 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>1996 Elections in New Hampshire</h1>

<p>The <a href="index.html">Libertarian Party of New Hampshire</a> ran
the following candidates for office in November 1996:</p>
<ul>
<li>US Senate: Ken Blevens: final count 21,366 votes (4.4%)
<li>US Representative District 1: Gary Flanders: with incomplete returns,
	7,811 votes (3%)
<li>Governor: Robert Kingsbury: final count 5,584 votes (1.1%)
<li>State Executive Council: Peter Gamble 
<li>State Representative District 14: James K. Wallack: 2,771 votes (16%)
<li>State Representative Rockingham District 8:
	<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/DonGorman.html">Don Gorman</a>
	(incumbent): 1,196 votes (23%)
</ul>

<p>Blevens's Senate bid held the balance of power in that election,
with the Republican getting 49% and the Democrat getting 46%. This
race was closely watched as being one the Democrats might pick up,
and early returns forecasted that they would get it.</p>

<p>The Libertarian Party lost ballot status in New Hampshire. Kingsbury
would have had to win 3% of the vote for the party to retain ballot status.
To get on the 1998 ballot, the party will have to collect 2,000 petition
signatures.</p>

<p>The Libertarian Party lost its only state representative in the nation
when a Democratic challenger unseated incumbent Don Gorman.</p>

<p>Any list of well-known Libertarians must include radio shock-jock <a

generated immense

<p>Stern was not the first Libertarian candidate for Governor of New York to
cause controversy. 1974 candidate <a

<title>It's the Spending</title>
<!-- Place: Pennsylvania (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1993? -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>It's the Spending</h1>

<p>Libertarian Party of Pennsylvania<br>
P.O. Box 4451, Allentown, PA  18105<br>
215-264-1921<br></p>

<p>The federal spending budget for FY 1993 is $1.515 trillion; which means the 
federal government spends more than four billion dollars every day
($4,151,000,000). [That's $172,958,300 per hour, $2,882,638 per minute,
$48,044 per second!]</p>

<p>President Clinton wants to increase taxes $246 billion in the next four 
years, but cut the central government's spending by a net of only
$78 billion. (Proposed spending cuts, $247 billion minus $169 billion,
proposed new spending.)</p>

<p>That's less than $20 billion a year, and $11 billion less than he plans to 
spend for a so-called 'stimulus' package during the next seven months.
$20 billion a year is within the range of statistical error in this 
sort of long-range forecasting - and represents no achievement at all.</p>

<p>He says that by 1997, the annual deficit will drop to $206 billion.</p>

<p>Let's put this into perspective:</p>

<p>A $206 billion deficit is larger than five of the deficits during the 
Reagan years (FY '81: $78.9B, '82: $127.9B, '84: $185.3B, '87: $150.4B,
& '88 $155.1B), and the first deficit during the Bush administration
('89: $152.1B).<a href="#fn1">[1]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the national debt will continue to grow.</p>

<p>Clinton's plan means higher taxes of $965 and spending cuts of $305 for 
every American.</p>

<p>Between 1981 and 1991, federal spending rose from $2,414 to $4,282 per 
person - an increase of $1,868 <a href="#fn2">[2]</a>. What took ten years to
accumulate, Clinton now says can be reduced by only one-sixth over the next
four years.</p>

<p>Democrats were firmly in control of Congress during the Reagan-Bush years.  
Clinton was elected largely by blaming Republicans for the tax, spending
and deficit increases of the past 12 years. Clinton now wants us to believe
that he and his fellow Democrats cannot undo more than one-sixth of the
damage.</p>

<p>To pay for part of his plan, Clinton wants to raise taxes on
corporations.</p>

<p>In 1991, the Fortune 500 Largest U.S. Industrial Corporations worked an 
entire year to earn profits of $55.138 billion on more than $2.2 trillion
in sales - a 2.4% profit margin. <a href="#fn3">[3]</a></p>

<p>At the federal government's current rate of spending ($4.151 billion a day),
all of the profits from the Fortune 500 companies in 1991 would last less
than two weeks (13.28 days).</p>

<p>Perhaps he wants to take more money from <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania's</a>
34 corporations on 
that Fortune 500 list - which lost a combined total of $1.6 billion in
1991.</p>

<p>Clinton also intends to raise taxes on those individuals he defines as 
"wealthy".</p>

<p><cite>Forbes</cite> magazine considers Ross Perot one of America's 400
wealthiest people, at $2.4 billion. <a href="#fn4">[4]</a></p>

<p>If the IRS could have instantly converted every penny of Ross Perot's 
wealth to cash when we got out of bed this morning, the federal government
would spend it all before most of us go to bed this evening.</p>

<p>Even the $6.3 billion that Forbes estimates Bill Gates of Microsoft is 
worth would last the federal government only one and one-half days. <a
href="#fn4">[4]</a></p>

<p>Taxing corporations will not stop the spending. Taking more from individuals
will not stop the spending. Indeed, each of the four most recent so-called
"budget summits" - all designed to cut the annual deficits - have resulted
in increased spending.</p>

<p>"Since 1929, federal expenditures (have grown) seven times as fast (as the 
gross domestic product). In 1929 private investment was five times larger
than the federal budget; in 1991 it was about half as large. Total
expenditures (by all governments) in 1929 were 12 percent of GDP; in 1991,
45 percent." <a href="#fn5">[5]</a></p>

<p>Clinton plans to deliberately increase this year's deficit some $31 billion.
Then, if everything works as he claims, the deficit in 4 years will taper off
to $206 billion a year.</p>

<p>In those four years, with much higher taxes and only minimal cuts in 
spending, the Clinton deficits will add another $1 trillion to the national
debt. That's more than the debt increased during President Reagan's first
five years in office.</p>

<p>Libertarians recognize that Clinton's proposed plan has badly placed 
priorities, grossly increases taxation, does virtually nothing to cut
spending - and will do little except leave all Americans worse off 
and more deeply in debt.  No nation has ever taxed itself into abundance 
and prosperity.</p>

<p>That's why the Libertarian Party is sponsoring the IT'S THE SPENDING! 
project.  We want every person in Pennsylvania to have a chance to suggest
ways to cut government spending.</p>

<p>For the next six weeks, until Income Tax Day, Thursday, April 15th, we want 
to get ideas from everyone. </p>

<p>By Tax Freedom Day - the day in May when every penny we earn no longer is 
taken to support the government, the day we can finally start working for
ourselves - we hope to have at least a preliminary set of suggestions to
pass along to the White House, our Senators, and our members of Congress.</p>

<p>When we're done, we'll be happy to send our list of spending cuts to 
everyone who wants one.  All suggestions should be mailed to:</p>

<p>IT'S THE SPENDING!

<title>1996 Pennsylvania Elections</title>
<!-- Place: Pennsylvania (USA) -->
<!-- Time: November 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>1996 Elections in Pennsylvania</h1>

<p>The <a href="index.html">Libertarian Party of Pennsylvania</a> ran
the following candidates for office in the November 1996 elections:</p>
<ul>
<li>US Representative District 6: Jerry L. Geleff 
<li>US Representative District 8: Richard J. Piotrowski:
	6,928 votes (3.1%)
<li>US Representative District 13: Patrick Burke: 4,942 votes (2.0%)
<li>Attorney General: Timothy William Collins: about 93,000 votes (2.3%)
<li>Auditor General: Sharon Shepps: about 104,000 votes (2.5%)
<li>State Treasurer:
	<a href="/revolution/by_name/F/JohnFamularo.html">John Famularo</a>:
	about 57,000 votes (1.4%)
<li>State Senate District 19: Tom McGrady 
<li>State House District 18: Charles Zatavekas 
<li>State House District 20: Charles Stutler 
<li>State House District 61: Sherry Rizzo 
<li>State House District 142: Matthew Stover 
<li>State House District 144: Don McGeady 
<li>State House District 145: Antoinette Hilmer 
<li>State House District 147: Bob Cassel 
<li>State House District 150: Hugh Braun 
<li>State House District 152: Peter Mergen 
<li>State House District 153: Brian McHugh 
<li>State House District 170: Steven Gilber 
<li>State House District 174: Joseph Sabatina 
<li>State House District 178: Darren Greway
<li>State House District 181: John Featherman 
<li>State House District 194: Joe McCarthy 
<li>State House District 202: Terry Zellers 
</ul>

<p>Burke's 5,000 vote showing for Congress was many times the margin
of victory of ten votes. The Democractic loser called for a recount.</p>

<p>The state party needed 2% in a statewide race to retain "minor party"
status, which it did. Minor party status allows voters to register in
the party, but petitioning is still required to get on the ballot.</p>

<title>TV Ads</title>

<body>

<h1>Television Ads</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a>:</p>

<p>The Washington LP is thinking about doing some TV ads, probably for 
broadcast during Rush Limbaugh's TV show or during "Star Trek:TNG" 
re-runs. I've got an idea that I'd like to bounce off you folks for a 
sanity check. The basic idea is that there will be one 60-second ad 
consisting of two 30-second spots shown back-to-back. Taken together, 
the ad will attract people who respect gun rights and will consider 
drug legalization (i.e., potential libertarians.)</p>

<p>Ideally, we would create customized versions of this ad so other state 
LPs could show their own 1-800 numbers. Interested state LPs would 
share the production costs and then raise money to broadcast it in their
areas.</p>

<pre>
"GUN CONTROL"
Video 1: White text on black
Audio 1: "All those in favor of gun control, raise your hands."
Video 2: Footage of Nazi rally with stiff-armed salute.
Audio 2: "Heil!"
Video 3: White text on black
Audio 3: "All those opposed?"
Video 4: Famous photo of little Jewish boy surrendering (with arms up) 
to SS soldier.
Audio 4: marching sounds
Video 5: White text on black: "Libertarian Party 1-800..."
Audio 5:  "The Libertarian Party says we must learn from history. We 
will never compromise your right to keep and bear arms. For a free 
information kit call 1-800..."

"DRUG PROHIBITION"
 Video 1: Photo of gangsters with tommy-guns
Audio 1: (sad ragtime music) "In the 1920s, alcohol prohibition gave us 
criminal gangs and turf wars, but it didn't stop alcohol use."

Video 2: Photo of repeal poster
Audio 2: (stop music) "We soon re-legalized alcohol to protect our 
children and our neighborhoods from these gangsters."

Video 3: Photo of gangs giving hand signals
Audio 3: (rap music) "Nowadays, drug prohibition has again given us 
criminal gangs and turf wars, but again, it isn't stopping drug use."

Video 5: White text on black: Libertarian Party 1-800...
"The Libertarian Party says we must learn from history. For a free 
information kit call 1-800..."

<title>Libertarian Justice Elected</title>
<!-- Place: Washington (USA) -->
<!-- Time: November 7, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Former Libertarian elected to Washington Supreme Court</h1>

<p>Richard B. Sanders, a former Libertarian Party member, was elected
to the nonpartisan Supreme Court of the state of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a> on November
7, 1995. Washington requires Supreme Court candidates to be nonpartisan,
and Washington voters do not register to vote in any particular party.</p>

<p>Sanders initially joined the Libertarian Party in 1984, is well-known
as an advocate of property rights and civil liberties, and focused
his campaign on a libertarian theme that government is too instrusive in
both personal and economic matters.</p>

<p>Sanders defeated incumbent Roselle Pekelis for the three-year term.</p>

<title>1996 West Virginia Elections</title>
<!-- Place: West Virginia (USA) -->
<!-- Time: November 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>1996 Elections in West Virginia</h1>

<p>The <a href="index.html">Libertarian Party of West Virginia</a> ran the
following candidates in the November 1996 elections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governor: Wallace Johnson: final count 15,958 votes (2.6%)
<li>State Senate District 9: Joseph Whelan: 3,994 votes (16.4%)
</ul>

<h2>Campaign Wins Major Party Status</h2>

<p>West Virginia, although of little electoral significance in the
presidential election, has some of the toughest ballot laws in the
country. The state always consumes tens of thousands of dollars
of L.P. presidential campaign resources to ensure 50-state ballot access,
as well as much of the resources of local and statewide candidates.</p>

<p>Libertarian gubernatorial candidate Dr. Wallace Johnson
ended that through the year 2000. He needed 1% of the vote to win the
Libertarian Party of West Virginia major party status in the
state, allowing the party to nominate candidates for any partisan office in
the state in the 1998 and 2000 elections without petitioning.
In late October, a poll by the Charleston <cite>Gazette</cite> found
2.4% support for Johnson, and he wound up with 2.5%.</p>

<p>Johnson's well-run campaign included a debate with the Democratic
and Republican candidates that was televised nationally on C-SPAN.</p>

a series of tips, tactics, strategies, and case studies that became
known as "Tom's Tips" and proved invaluable to activists across
the country trying to learn how to grow their parties and run
campaigns. This web page has grown from that effort and now includes
articles from many people.</p>

<p>The premier resource for Libertarian activists is the outstanding
newsletter <cite>Libertarian Volunteer</cite>, edited by LP Communications
Director <a href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWinter.html">Bill Winter</a>.
It is simply the best newsletter in the libertarian movement. It is
written for LP volunteers, activists, officers, and candidates. If you are
one of those, send your request to Bill Winter to get on that mailing
list.</p>

<title>Harry Browne for President</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Harry Browne for President</h1>

<p>The 1996 <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
national convention nominated author and investment adviser
<a href="/revolution/by_name/B/HarryBrowne.html">Harry Browne</a>
for President of the United States, and entrepreneur
<a href="/revolution/by_name/J/JoJorgensen.html">Jo Jorgensen</a>
for Vice President.</p>

<p>The campaign broke records for the party, setting several milestones
and heading the ticket for the party's <a href="index.html">1996 election
efforts</a>.</p>

<p>Final returns show the Browne/Jorgensen ticket
received 485,120 votes (0.5% of the total). This is the second-best
Libertarian showing ever, falling short only of our
<a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/election/1980/">1980</a> total.
Browne came in fifth, behind Bill Clinton, Bob Dole,
Ross Perot and Ralph Nader.</p>

<p>Browne did best in Arizona, Nevada and Alaska, getting about 1% of
the vote there.</p>

<hr>

<p>Browne <a href="announce.html">announced his candidacy</a> in 1994,
drawing on his following from his books and newsletters for support.
Browne was successfully able to get support from a broader base than
just current party members, with the party and the campaign raising
a record total $3 million in 1996.</p>

<p>Browne <a href="campaigned95.html">campaigned hard in '95</a> for
the party's nomination, visiting state conventions and giving occasional
speeches. Later that year, <cite>Why Government Doesn't Work</cite>
was published, generating significant interest in the campaign.
One of the year's interesting moments was <a href="cityvote.html">City
Vote</a>, a poll intended to focus the campaign on urban issues. Browne
was one of a couple of third-party candidates to qualify for the
ballot, and polled just under one percent.</p>

<p>Browne continued campaigning for the nomination in early 1996,
winning <a href="nhprimary.html">New Hampshire's Libertarian primary</a>
as well as other such contests. Browne handily won the party's nomination
at the national convention held July 4 - 7, 1996 in Washington, D.C.
Unsuccessful candidates for the nomination included
<a href="/revolution/by_name/O/DouglassOhmen.html">Douglass J.  Ohmen</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_name/S/IrwinSchiff.html">Irwin Schiff</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_name/T/RickTompkins.html">Rick Tompkins</a>.</p>

<p>Browne then continued a rigorous
full-time campaign, appearing on hundreds of radio talk shows. As
the election neared,
<a href="media.html">media coverage</a> intensified, with appearances on
CNN's Larry King Live, C-SPAN, the Lehrer News Hour, and other news
programs.</p>

<p>Libertarians organized on the Internet very effectively, distributing
campaign news via mailing lists and ganging together to dominate
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.coil.com/~ggorka/polls.html">every online poll</a> put on
the web. Net-savvy libertarians also organized
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://home.connectnet.com/qqq/speech/">Stop the Browne-Out</a>,
an independent effort to get Browne included in the debates. While
ultimately unsuccessful, the group did manage to get many journalists,
both online and print, to endorse Browne's inclusion in the debates.
Online political sites <a href="mentions.html">mentioned the party
frequently</a>.</p>

<p>The party achieved 50-state ballot status within a couple of
months of its convention, becoming the first third party ever to accomplish
that feat two presidential elections in a row. Only Clinton, Dole and
Perot were also on all ballots.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Post Mortem</h2>

<p>In December 1996, Browne offered to answer any questions about his
campaign to several online forums. Asking a libertarian for an opinion
is like asking an insurance salesman for a pitch, so he was nearly
inundated with suggestions and questions, most favorable.</p>

<p>Regarding his future plans, Browne said: "I do not know whether I'll
run again in 2000. I can't make that decision until 1999. It will depend
on whether the party is big enough to make a serious run, whether I have
commitments of sufficient funds to be able to begin the campaign with
$1 million in hand and know that it's likely we'll have $30 million or
more for the campaign itself, and whether I still feel young enough to
undertake the task."</p>

<p>In the meantime, he has set up an exploratory committee to start
raising money, has begun a syndicated radio commentary, and is trying
to become part of a lecture bureau to speak on politics at events across
the country.</p>

<title>LP Endorsements</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Endorsements of Libertarian Candidates</h1>

<p>One reason 1996 will be remembered as a breakthrough year for the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
is the increased number of endorsements of Libertarian candidates
by other organizations.</p>

<p>The <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">National Rifle Association</a>
officially endorsed Libertarian Jon Coon for state representative in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan</a>, and
Libertarian Gary Fallon for state senate district 24 in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/Phoenix.html">Phoenix</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a>.</p>

<p>The Illinois State Rifle Association endorsed Libertarian Frank
Stratman for U.S. House 2nd Congressional District in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="browne/">Libertarian presidential ticket</a> of Harry Browne
and Jo Jorgensen was endorsed by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gun rights advocate, author and registered Democrat David Kopel.
<li><cite>Voices of the Florida Taxpayer</cite>, a tax reform group.
<li><cite>OutNOW!</cite>, a San Jose, California gay newspaper
<li><cite>Prison Life</cite>, a prisoners' rights magazine
<li>over a hundred radio talk show hosts
</ul>

<title>Marrou Ads</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: report January 20, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Marrou Ads</h1>

<p>January 20, 1993, from
<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/SteveGivot.html">Steve Givot</a>:</p>

<p>The Clock ad, on the other had, produced 4 people more likely to vote for
Andre and Nancy (as a result of seeing the ad) for each 1 person less likely
to vote for them.  This ratio (4:1) is <em>clearly</em> superior to the ratios
for the two issues ads (4:9).</p>

<p>The Clock ad testing also indicated that it would produce significantly more
calls than any of the other two ads tested.  At least 33% more calls.  
That makes it <em>clearly</em> superior on that measurement.</p>

<p>There were numerous other responses that the testing measured.  Interviewees
were asked to rate the ads using a list of positive adjectives which the
designer of the test provided.  These included:  thought-provoking (1),
warm and human (3), clever(1), entertaining(4), sincere(1), 
informative(3), interesting(tied 2), educational(1), an ad for people 
like me(2), made me angry with typical politicians(3), trustworthy(tied 3),
and better than most political advertising(1).</p>

<p>The numbers in parentheses indicate its ranking among the four ads tested.
(1) is the best result.  The sum of these for the four ads is as follows:</p>

<pre>
	Clock           26.0
	Bad Images      35.5
	Waste           28.0
	Winds           30.5
</pre>

<p>The lowest score was the best score.  The best possible score was 12.  
The Clock ad slightly edged the Waste ad in this tally.</p>

<p>The interviewees were also asked to rate the ads using a list of negative
agjectives.  These were:  offensive(3), made me angry with advertiser
(3), worse than most political advertising (tied 3), untrue(4), confusing
(3), and inappropriate(tied 3).</p>

<p>The numbers in parentheses indicate the ranking of the Clock ad among the
four ads.  (4) is the best result.  The sum of these for the four ads is
as follows:</p>

<pre>
	Clock           20.0
	Bad Images      11.0
	Waste           20.5
	Winds            8.5
</pre>

<p>Here the <em>highest</em> score was the best (i.e. least negative response).
 The best possible score was 24.   Clock was slightly edged by Waste on this
measurement.  Here you can clearly see that the most purely ideological
ad among them -- Winds of Change -- got an almost perfectly <em>bad</em> score.
That is to say that it almost always left a <em>negative</em> impression of the
interviewees.  It was clearly the most "offensive."</p>

<title>The Marrou Campaign</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Andre Marrou's Presidential Campaign</h1>

<p>From John Mcpherson (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]">
<a href="mailto:mcpherso@macvax.ucsd.edu">mcpherso@macvax.ucsd.edu</a>):</p>

<p>Last night <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/AndreMarrou.html">Andre Marrou</a>
gave a speech to my Toastmaster Club, and I offer a summary of it, with his
permission.</p>

<p>He basically covered his post-campaign reflections on his experience 
as the Libertarian Presidential candidate, and offered some advice 
and answered questions from the audience.</p>

<p>Things we did right:</p>

<ol>
<li>Winning in Dixville Notch.  
   Note: he said that he had to fight his own people (campaign 
   management, staff, LP leadership) in order to do this.
<li>Getting 50 state ballot access (1.5 weeks before Perot did).
   Note: some state branches (eg, North Carolina) of the LP fought 
   against this, claiming that it was a national LP matter only.
   Note 2: The media should have reported this, but it was ignored.
<li>Having a woman on the ticket, especially in the "Year of the Woman".
   Neither the Demos, Repubs or Peros had a woman on the ticket.
   Note: the Press ignored all this.
<li>Getting 2 Libertarians elected, and 2 re-elected, in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire</a>.
<li>Using TV.
   Note: he had to fight the LP for that.  Many Libertarians seem
   stuck on print media, which has limited readership.  The electronic
   media is the way of the future.
<li>Having over 1000 Libertarian candidates down-ticket.
   Note: Perot's party had only about 10.
<li>Having a low "dollars per vote" ratio.
   (now only if we had more money ...)
</ol>

<p>Things we did wrong:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not enough money.
   We only had on the order of 10,000 contributors, and the average
   contribution was (only) about $25.
<li>We didn't bring a lawsuit against the Presidential Debate 
   Commission, which barred him from the debates.
   Note: he couldn't convince party leadership to do this.
<li>Not enough TV.
   He said that we should have spent almost every penny on it.
<li>The ongoing internecine war in the LP.
   Such divisiveness only hurts us.  If we have a complaint against
   another person, we should take it up with that person privately.
<li>Lack of a hierarchy.
   Although as Libertarians we often feel that our opinions are just
   as valid as everyone else's, this simply isn't true.  Some of us
   have had more experience and success, and are more capable of
   focussing efforts effectively.
</ol>

<p>The future of the LP:</p>

<ol>
<li>We should do what is necessary (without initiating force or fraud)
   in order to win.
<li>We need people with charisma (winning elections is basically a 
   personality contest), and who know how to explain our philosophy well
   to the "3 Ps": public, press and peers.  We need to make it more palatable;
   it's not necessary to water it down.
<li>We don't need to sell out in order to win elections, and, once in office
   a Libertarian will likely become more libertarian, not less.  As bad
   as you think government is, it is worse than that!
<li>Both Republicans and Democrats are socialists.  Republicans are right-wing
   socialists, and democrats are left-wing socialists.  He defines socialism
   as the transfer of money and power to the government.
   We want to get money and power back into the hands of the individuals,
   and we should emphasize this point.
<li>Both Republicans and Democrats want to mandate what they see as "good",
   and to prohibit what they see as "bad", and on many points they are on
   opposing sides.  Libertarians want neither to mandate nor prohibit, we
   want to put the choice back to the individuals.  In this sense, we
   occupy the _middle_ground_, and we would do well to present ourselves 
   as such.
</ol>

<title>Jon Coon on Bill Thomas</title>
<!-- Place: Michigan (USA) -->
<!-- Time: August 7, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>Jon Coon on the Bill Thomas Show</h1>

<p>From Mike Devour (<img src="/images/mail.gif" alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:mdevour@msen.com">mdevour@msen.com</a>):</p>

<p>Sunday evening, August 7, during envelope stuffing for the post-primary
newsletter, a supporter called Headquarters to alert Jon Coon to an invitation
to call from talk-radio host Bill Thomas (WXYT-AM). Jon called and was soon on
the air ...</p>

<p><b>Thomas:</b> On the line with us we have the Libertarian candidate for
[U.S.] Senate, Mr. Jon Coon. Jon thanks for being on the show.</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> Well thanks for having me on.</p>

<p><b>Thomas:</b> Obviously you heard we were talking about you yesterday.</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> Well we have a <em>whole</em> lot of supporters who listen to
WXYT all the time.</p>

<p><b>Thomas:</b> Well I appreciate it.</p>

<p>Listen, ... people ... were so incensed with the way it turned 
  into that mudslinging the last nine days that they were 
  considering going outside the party. A number of callers 
  called back and said "You're biting off your nose to spite 
  your face. Jon Coon is unelectable because he's outside the 
  two party mainstream."</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> That usually comes from Republicans and I've heard that very 
  same comment quite a bit during the course of this campaign. And 
  the fact of the matter is if we are to have any chance of winning
  this election--and we believe we do--we have to pull just as many
  Democratic votes as we pull Republican votes. And make no mistake
  about it we are in this campaign to win it, and from day one 
  we've targeted Democratic votes.</p>

<p>The Democratic party in the state of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan</a> just did the best 
  thing on earth they could have possibly done for this campaign. 
  They elected the weakest candidate in the field -- they gave us 
  Bob Carr. </p>

<p>And, really, the Republican party did the same thing, quite 
  frankly. I think the people of this state would have been better 
  served with Ronna Romney. That's not what they gave us to choose 
  from, they gave us Spencer Abraham. </p>

<p>And I don't want to get into the mudslinging game with my 
  opponents either, but I think to a lot of the people in this 
  state it's coming down to a race between a beltway politician, 
  a beltway politician, and a Libertarian.</p>

<p><b>Thomas:</b> For the people who don't know, explain the Libertarian
Party.</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> Well, the Libertarian Party believes in freedom -- and that's
  usually where the press quits talking about us. They like to give
  people the impression that that's all we believe in -- is having 
  people running around free to do anything that they want.</p>

<p>Well that's not true. The Libertarian Party understands what 
  freedom is about, what it really means, and <em>that</em> means that 
  we believe in the responsibility that goes along with it.</p>

<p>We want the government to be out of your economic life and out 
  of your personal life. We want you left free, pretty much to run 
  your own affairs. And we want you to accept responsibility for 
  your decisions. That's pretty much what you're going to find 
  written in a little book I carry around with me all the time 
  called the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<p>Thomas: Well it sounds like a whole lot of what the people who call 
  me day in and day out say they're looking for in a candidate. ...
  How about individual rights? One of the things that people throw
  up to the Libertarian party once in a while is "Oh, you're for 
  legalization of drugs."</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> Well, I'll tell you what I want, Bill. I want to see a 
  situation develop in this country where we no longer make it 
  possible for drug dealers to profit by pushing drugs.</p>

<p>  The reason why we have such a drug problem in our schools today
  is because of the fact we've made it extremely profitable to do
  so. The reason we have a drug problem in our schools is because 
  the kid five lockers down from your kid is making a hundred bucks 
  a day selling the stuff, and that's the only reason it's there.</p>

<p>  You know, it's become a situation here where I'm not the only one
  that feels that way. I'm in real good company on this issue -- from
  William F. Buckley Jr., to the Mayor of Baltimore, to Thomas Bray
  right here in
  <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/Detroit.html">Detroit</a>
   -- all the way down the line to sixty federal
  court judges. Theres a whole lot of people out there who 
  understand that our current approach is not working. </p>

<p>  Now, does that mean we have to go out there whole-hog and change 
  everything we're doing overnight? Of course not! And we're not 
  going to do that in a six year Senate term from one Senator 
  either. But, I'll tell you this, I'm going to be looking at 
  solutions that make some sense rather than what we're doing today.</p>

<p><b>Thomas:</b> ...If people wanted to find out more about you and your 
  campaign, where would they get in touch with you?</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> Well, for those who aren't already familiar with us -- and 
  I've got to tell you it's a shrinking number ...</p>

<p><b>Thomas:</b> Yea, I would agree that it is a shrinking number ...</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> They can call 800 J-O-N C-O-O-N. And that'll ring right into 
  my campaign headquarters and we will get you <em>everything</em> you want
  to know.</p>

<p><b>Thomas:</b> Jon, I would like to...have you on the show, talk about 
  the issues with you, have...you take some calls about this. 
  Would you make yourself available?</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> Oh I'd love to do it. That's the only way to do it. Give us 
  an hour to chat and we'll come out real well.</p>

<p><b>Thomas:</b> Jon, thanks for calling.</p>

<p><b>Coon:</b> Thank you.</p>

<title>Jon Coon Editorial</title>
<!-- Place: Detroit, Michigan (USA) -->
<!-- Time: June 19, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Editorial Favorable to Libertarian</h1>

<p>Editorial from the Sunday, June 19, 1994
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/Detroit.html">Detroit</a>
<cite>News and Free Press</cite>, posted by George Weeks, whose comments
appear in brackets:</p>

<p>It's been a struggle for all of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi">Michigan's</a> candidates
for U.S. Senate to get much attention during what has been a yawner of 
a campaign.</p>

<p>Libertarian contender Jon Coon has an added struggle: to avoid 
being ignored by rival candidates, the press and sponsors of 
joint forums.</p>

<p>Coon is waging the best campaign I can recall by a third-party 
state-wide candidate in Michigan. That's not saying much, 
considering the lack of minor party successes.</p>

<p>Nationwide, 116 Libertarians -- including some state legislators --
hold public office. None won in Michigan or on Capitol Hill.</p>

<p>When asked on a June 3 Off the Record public TV show about 
failure of previous Libertarian candidates here, feisty Coon 
snapped: "Ever see one campaign as hard as I have?"</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Coon strikes me as a cross between Ross Perot and Gen. George 
"Blood & Guts" Patton.</p>

<p>Like formula-man Perot, Coon speaks in sound-bite spurts and 
says the two big parties aren't getting the job done: "There is 
no fiscally conservative party left in Washington. ...Help me 
break this country's addiction to big government. ...I can get 
something done. ...We're freedom and responsibility-driven."</p>

<p>Like Patton, the former Michigan National Guard platoon leader 
has blazing eyes and takes no guff.</p>

<p>Asked about the new ban on assault weapons, this hard-charging 
disciple of the <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NRA.html">National Rifle
Association</a> insists they are "defense weapons."</p>

<p>He's sorry he voted for John Engler for governor and calls his 
school-reform Proposal A "a bad joke on the people of this state."</p>

<p>Concluding a Memorial Day appearance on WJR's Kevin Joyce Show, 
Coon said of the two Republicans and six Democrats seeking 
gubernatorial [Weeks probably means senatorial] nominations: 
"We'll be waiting -- guns lowered -- for them to come out of this 
(Aug. 2) primary."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Coon, who has raised about $50,000 [That was then!],
is running some campaign commercials. A TV spot that ends with 
Coon's anti-big government pitch begins with dollars being 
flushed down a toilet.</p>

<p>As evidenced by his WJR and public TV appearances, Coon is 
getting some exposure. But he gets shut out of such traditional 
forums as the Greater Detroit Chamber of Commerce's recent 
Mackinac Island conference, to which all major party candidates 
were invited.</p>

<p>The chamber rejected an appeal by Comerica Bank Vice-President
David Littman, who said Coon has qualified for the Nov. 8 ballot 
and "is staunchly pro-business and pro-market. He is a defender 
of private property rights and speaks eloquently on behalf of a 
better business climate."</p>

<p>Although I occasionally cover Libertarians and other minor party 
candidates, they certainly don't get equal treatment here. They 
get note, but not top billing.</p>

<p>This is not a space of record, but of opinion.</p>

<p>In a June 14 column on women running for Congress, I said: "It's
conceivable that on Nov. 8, there will be a faceoff between two
women in the U.S. Senate race" -- Democrat Lana Pollack and 
Republican Ronna Romney.</p>

<p>That day, I got a fax from Coon aide Bill Shotey: "Correction...
(it) will NOT be a faceoff between two women. It will be a THREE-
WAY race with Jon Coon & the two survivors."</p>

<p>And Coon will finish third. Still, his agressive, guns-lowered
campaign merits note. Today, it's top billing.</p>

<title>Jon Coon Debate</title>
<!-- Place: Michigan (USA) -->
<!-- Time: reported June 13, 1994 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>Jon Coon Senate Debate</h1>

<p>From the June 13, 1994 <cite>Inside Michigan Politics</cite>, a bi-monthly
newsletter widely read by <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan</a> media and
political operatives, and edited
by Bill Ballenger, an often consulted expert on state politics:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"How about I take the first half-hour, and you take the second 
half-hour." -- A whey-faced E. Spencer Abraham, one of two 
Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate, to Libertarian nominee 
Jon Coon in the studios of WJR-AM on Memorial Day. Abraham was 
displaying how a candidate with what his campaign describes as 
"guts" reacts when he finds that his schedulers have boxed him 
into a debate with a Libertarian for an hour on live radio -- 
his voice goes up about two octaves, he demands a private 
audience with moderator Kevin Joyce, and he offers to split the

<h1><a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a> of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire</a></h1>

<p>The Libertarian Party of New Hampshire, a state whose motto is
"Live Free or Die," is arguably the most successful Libertarian state
affiliate. The party has racked up an impressive number of wins
to local offices, as well as state legislators. Its influence
is greater than its numbers, resulting in statewide appointments
and successful legislation.</p>

<title>Stern Announces Candidacy</title>
<!-- Place: Buffalo, New York (USA) -->
<!-- Time: March 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Howard Stern Announces Candidacy for Governor</h1>

<p>In March 1993, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York</a>
 "shock jock" Howard Stern announced he would
run for the Libertarian Party nomination for Governor of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New
York</a>.</p>

<p>Libertarians split over whether to accept or reject Stern as a candidate.
Supporters believed Stern could attract large numbers to the party and
help gain permanent ballot access. Opponents distrusted Stern's sincerity
and adherence to party ideas, and think Stern's image embarassed the
party.</p>

<p>Stern is the first celebrity to run for a Libertarian nomination. His radio
show is heard by an estimated 20 million listeners nationwide, in
several <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/">New York</a> cities,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/LosAngeles.html">Los
Angeles</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Dallas.html">Dallas</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/la/NewOrleans.html">New Orleans</a>,
Cleveland,
Boston and El Paso.</p>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission, which Libertarians advocate
abolishing, fined Stern's show $1.67 million for indecency. Stern's employer,
Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, is fighting the fines in court.</p>

<p>Stern's announcement has attracted significant attention to the Libertarian
Party. Geraldo Rivera did a show on the party, and the BBC called for
background, said
<a href="/revolution/by_name/C/TamaraClark.html">Tamara Clark</a>, the
party's national marketing director.</p>

<p>Stern's beliefs more or less fit with the libertarian philosophy. Stern
supports freedom of expression, individuality and drug relegalization. Stern
also supports the death penalty, an issue libertarians are divided on.</p>

<p>Among Stern's detractors is the former front runner for the nomination,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/Buffalo.html">Buffalo</a>
 lawyer James Ostrowski.</p>

<p>"He makes a living offending people with lowbrow, sophomoric humor. Is that
the type of guy who's going to accurately portray our ideas to the people of
New York?" Ostrowski said.</p>

<p>"For people who don't like Howard Stern's brand of entertainment, there's a
thing on the radio that changes the station or turns it off," said <a
href="/revolution/by_name/D/SteveDasbach.html">Steve Dasbach</a>, the party's
national chairman. "That's the idea of freedom of
individual choice that the Libertarian Party stands for."</p>

<title>Stan Dworkin</title>
<!-- Place: New York (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Lieutenant Governor Candidate Stan Dworkin</h1>

<p>June 1994, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/JohnFamularo.html">John
Famularo</a>:</p>

<p>Many people have asked, "Who is Stan Dworkin"? Well, I would like to
provide a little information for this net.</p>

<p>I met Stan briefly at the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/Albany.html">Albany</a>
 convention, but did not get to speak to
him until a month later. He had already met with Dottie-Lou Brokaw where
they reviewed the LP Platform and libertarian philosophy. He took the
World's Smallest Quiz at the convention and scored 80/75. He also signed a
five sentence pledge required for membership in the NYLP.</p>

<p>He is taking this election very seriously and is devoting a lot of time and
energy in preparing for the upcoming campaign season.  His son Matt, a
student at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, seems to
be a pretty good libertarian too.</p>

<p>On Monday, June 20th Stan Dworkin addressed an assembly of Libertarians in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York
City</a> who had originally expected to hear Michael Moriority.  He
acquitted himself beautifully, and was warmly applauded by an audience that
was largely hostile just a few weeks before. The Statewide ticket of Stern,
Dworkin, Siegel, and Guyer will rely heavily on Dworkin in the coming
months, if as I expect, Stern will refrain from conducting a standard
campaign and refer the media to Dworkin.</p>

<p>Mr. Dworkin makes a good appearance and is well spoken.  He will be a
credible spokesman for the LP of New York. If you met him, you would like
him.</p>

<p>Mr Dworkin's curriculum vitae are as follows:</p>

<p>STANLEY H. DWORKIN<br>
8 EAGLE VIEW COURT<br>
MONSEY, NY 10952-4401</p>

items for the hat and fraternal regalia industry since 1980.</p>

<p>Age 45, married, wife Cathie and two sons, Matthew, 18, and Daniel, 14.</p>

<p>Prior to entering the business world he taught Social Studies, American
History, and Anthropology in Junior High School and High School.</p>

<p>Worked as researcher for Dr. Margaret Mead at the Museum of National
History.</p>

<p>MA in Anthropology from New York University.</p>

<p>His disagreement with the Democrat Party leadership was over his refusal to
accept the patronage system and his insistence on the merit system.</p>

<p>If we are to become a majority at any time in the near future (25 years),
we need community leaders like Stan Dworkin to join our ranks and publicly
proclaim themselves as Libertarians.</p>

<title>Stan Dworkin's Quiz Results</title>
<!-- Place: New York (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 1993 -->

<h1>Stan Dworkin's "Nolan Chart" Quiz</h1>

<p>From Stan Dworkin's son Matthew I. Dworkin (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a
href="mailto:matt.dworkin@launchpad.unc.edu">matt.dworkin@launchpad.unc.edu</a>,

<a href="mailto:prufrock@genie">prufrock@genie</a>, <a
href="mailto:dante@genie">dante@genie</a>), on the results of his father's
"Nolan Test":</p>

<p>The following are the responses my father had, as far as I can recall,
when we discussed this.</p>

<ul>
<li>Military service should be voluntary. (No draft.)
<li>Absolutely.
<p>
<li>Gov't should not control radio, TV or the press.
<li>Yes (agree).
<p>
<li>Repeal regulations on sex by consenting adults.
<li>Maybe (would have to think about it).
<p>
<li>Drug laws do more harm than good. Repeal them.
<li>Maybe. Marijuana no problem, have to think about stronger ones.
<p>
<li>Let people immigrate and emigrate freely.
<li>No problem.
<p>
<li>Businesses and farms should operate without gov't subsidy.
<li>No problem.
<p>
<li>People are better off with free trade than with tarriffs.
<li>I don't recall his reaction to this.
<p>
<li>Minimum wage laws cause unemployment.  Repeal them.
<li>Sure.
<p>
<li>End taxes. Pay for services with user fees.
<li>I do not recall his reaction to this. I believe he was unsure what the
plan would be for this.
<p>
<li><a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe</a> and <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japan</a> should pay for their own
defense.
<li>Absolutely.
</ul>

<p>Stan Dworkin's overall rating is at least 80/60. According to the Nolan
Test,
this makes him a libertarian.</p>

<title>LPMC Formation</title>
<!-- Place: Montgomery County, Texas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: November 1992 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Proposal for forming the Libertarian Party of Montgomery County,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a></h1>

<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/G/KenGaillotJr.html">Ken Gaillot Jr.</a></p>

<p>To achieve success at the national level, the Libertarian Party will need to
prove its competence and viability at handling public policy. Name recognition
and credibility at the state and local levels will help achieve this goal.
Local affiliates of the Libertarian Party, therefore, are valuable not only for
influencing public policy but also for building the case for libertarianism at
the national level.</p>

<p>I propose the formation of the Libertarian Party of Montgomery County
(LPMC), to be affiliated with the state and national LPs, to pursue the goals
of name recognition, credibility and influence over local public policy.</p>

<p>To succeed, the LPMC will need a thorough knowledge of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Media: the address, phone/fax numbers and advertising rates of all
newspapers, magazines, cable companies and TV and radio stations serving the
county.</p>

<li><p>Government: current officeholders, terms of office, geographical area
covered, etc., of all elective offices in the county.</p>

<li><p>Community: list of all charitable, religious, social etc. groups in the
county.</p>

<li><p>The libertarian movement: libertarian magazines and books dealing with
issues of interest in the county, outreach materials available from libertarian
organizations, etc.</p>
</ul>

<p>The usefulness of such information is obvious. The LPMC will need to use the
media for advertising and for coverage of any events sponsored. Knowledge of
government offices will allow the LPMC to run viable campaigns and to identify
officeholders who may be open to libertarian ideas. Voluntary groups in the
community can be targeted by the LPMC for outreach, and may be parts of
coalitions on specific issues. Access to libertarian resources will allow the
LPMC to use strategies that have worked elsewhere and to support positions on
specific issues.</p>

<p>Of course, to be successful the LPMC will also have to take an active role
in promoting libertarianism. Depending on the level of funding and volunteer
activism, the LPMC could, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Speak at local groups: representatives of the LPMC could speak to local
high school civics classes and to the voluntary community groups mentioned
before, either as an introduction to libertarianism or on specific issues.</p>

<li><p>Sponsor events: the LPMC could hold debates, candidate forums, seminars,
parties, protests and so forth.</p>

<li><p>Advertise libertarian ideas: the LPMC could run TV and radio commercials
promoting the Libertarian Party or libertarian viewpoints on specific issues.
This would also include letters-to-the-editor for county newspapers.</p>

<li><p>Run political campaigns: winning elective office should be a major goal
of the LPMC. Well-run campaigns and high-profile officeholders would go a long
way to establishing the LP's credibility.</p>
</ul>

<p>The goals of such actions include name recognition, outreach, fundraising
and press coverage. Speeches and debates will give potential candidates
speaking experience. Successful political campaigns will allow the LPMC to
advance libertarianism directly.</p>

<p>There are many specific events that a newly-founded LPMC, with minimal
funding and volunteerism, could sponsor. An affiliation ceremony (party)
marking the formation of the LPMC could strengthen links between the LPMC and
the Harris County and Texas LPs. LPMCers could write letters to the editor on
various issues. The LPMC could also protest Tax Day, memorialize Tiananmen
Square or speak to a civic group.</p>

<p>I have the experience necessary to get a libertarian organization off the
ground. While attending Louisiana State University, I re-activated the College
Libertarians at LSU, serving as president from 1987 to 1989 and as treasurer in
1990 and 1991. I organized many speeches, debates and outreach efforts for the
College Libertarians. I also collected signatures to get <a
href="/revolution/by_name/P/RonPaul.html">Ron Paul</a> on the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/fl/">Florida</a> ballot
in 1988, and coordinated precinct walking for a Libertarian
campaign for the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/la/">Louisiana</a> State Senate
in 1991. I moved to the Woodlands,
Texas, in January 1992, and look forward to advancing liberty in Texas.</p>

<title>Harry Browne for President</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Harry Browne for President</h1>

<p>The 1996 <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
national convention nominated author and investment adviser
<a href="/revolution/by_name/B/HarryBrowne.html">Harry Browne</a>
for President of the United States, and entrepreneur
<a href="/revolution/by_name/J/JoJorgensen.html">Jo Jorgensen</a>
for Vice President.</p>

<p>The campaign broke records for the party, setting several milestones
and heading the ticket for the party's <a href="index.html">1996 election
efforts</a>.</p>

<p>Final returns show the Browne/Jorgensen ticket
received 485,120 votes (0.5% of the total). This is the second-best
Libertarian showing ever, falling short only of our
<a href="/revolution/politics/lpus/election/1980/">1980</a> total.
Browne came in fifth, behind Bill Clinton, Bob Dole,
Ross Perot and Ralph Nader.</p>

<p>Browne did best in Arizona, Nevada and Alaska, getting about 1% of
the vote there.</p>

<hr>

<p>Browne <a href="announce.html">announced his candidacy</a> in 1994,
drawing on his following from his books and newsletters for support.
Browne was successfully able to get support from a broader base than
just current party members, with the party and the campaign raising
a record total $3 million in 1996.</p>

<p>Browne <a href="campaigned95.html">campaigned hard in '95</a> for
the party's nomination, visiting state conventions and giving occasional
speeches. Later that year, <cite>Why Government Doesn't Work</cite>
was published, generating significant interest in the campaign.
One of the year's interesting moments was <a href="cityvote.html">City
Vote</a>, a poll intended to focus the campaign on urban issues. Browne
was one of a couple of third-party candidates to qualify for the
ballot, and polled just under one percent.</p>

<p>Browne continued campaigning for the nomination in early 1996,
winning <a href="nhprimary.html">New Hampshire's Libertarian primary</a>
as well as other such contests. Browne handily won the party's nomination
at the national convention held July 4 - 7, 1996 in Washington, D.C.
Unsuccessful candidates for the nomination included
<a href="/revolution/by_name/O/DouglassOhmen.html">Douglass J.  Ohmen</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_name/S/IrwinSchiff.html">Irwin Schiff</a> and
<a href="/revolution/by_name/T/RickTompkins.html">Rick Tompkins</a>.</p>

<p>Browne then continued a rigorous
full-time campaign, appearing on hundreds of radio talk shows. As
the election neared,
<a href="media.html">media coverage</a> intensified, with appearances on
CNN's Larry King Live, C-SPAN, the Lehrer News Hour, and other news
programs.</p>

<p>Libertarians organized on the Internet very effectively, distributing
campaign news via mailing lists and ganging together to dominate
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.coil.com/~ggorka/polls.html">every online poll</a> put on
the web. Net-savvy libertarians also organized
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://home.connectnet.com/qqq/speech/">Stop the Browne-Out</a>,
an independent effort to get Browne included in the debates. While
ultimately unsuccessful, the group did manage to get many journalists,
both online and print, to endorse Browne's inclusion in the debates.
Online political sites <a href="mentions.html">mentioned the party
frequently</a>.</p>

<p>The party achieved 50-state ballot status within a couple of
months of its convention, becoming the first third party ever to accomplish
that feat two presidential elections in a row. Only Clinton, Dole and
Perot were also on all ballots.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Post Mortem</h2>

<p>In December 1996, Browne offered to answer any questions about his
campaign to several online forums. Asking a libertarian for an opinion
is like asking an insurance salesman for a pitch, so he was nearly
inundated with suggestions and questions, most favorable.</p>

<p>Regarding his future plans, Browne said: "I do not know whether I'll
run again in 2000. I can't make that decision until 1999. It will depend
on whether the party is big enough to make a serious run, whether I have
commitments of sufficient funds to be able to begin the campaign with
$1 million in hand and know that it's likely we'll have $30 million or
more for the campaign itself, and whether I still feel young enough to
undertake the task."</p>

<p>In the meantime, he has set up an exploratory committee to start
raising money, has begun a syndicated radio commentary, and is trying
to become part of a lecture bureau to speak on politics at events across
the country.</p>

<h2>Election Trivia</h2>

other than Clinton and Dole (no Perot, no Nader, etc.).</p>

<title>Harry Browne for President</title>
<!-- Place: ??? (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Investment Author Announces Libertarian Bid</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/B/HarryBrowne.html">Harry Browne</a>,
best-selling author of nine books over the last two decades
and well-known investment adviser, announced in 1994 his intention to
campaign for the 1996 Libertarian Party presidential nomination.</p>

<p>In telephone conversations with national party officials, Browne outlined
his goal to "make the Libertarian Party a permanent, substantial force in
American politics." His intentions was to recruit new members for the
party and one campaign goal was to double the membership of the party by
1996.</p>

<p>One of Browne's advantages, he said, was that he could garner significant
support, including campaign financing, from outside the present membership
of the Libertarian Party. In fact, the Party and the Browne campaign
together raised over $3 million in 1996, a record for the party.</p>

<p>Winning the election is a long-shot, he admitted, but he does not concede
that it outside the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>Browne, a
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a> resident,
has not run for public office before and in fact previously advocated
staying out of politics.  He has not previously been a member of the
Libertarian Party or any other political party. However, his writings have
been influential in the Libertarian movement.</p>

<p>His books include <cite>You Can Profit from the Coming Monetary
Crisis</cite> and <cite>How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World</cite>.
Following libertarian tradition, Browne wrote a campaign book,
titling his <cite>Why Government Doesn't Work</cite>. The book was the
first libertarian campaign book to be distributed to the mass market.</p>

<p>Brown pledged to begin campaigning full-time in January 1995.
Campaign supporters include investment newsletter publishers and authors
Mark Skousen and Douglas Casey, and 1984 Libertarian Presidential candidate
<a href="/revolution/by_name/B/DavidBergland.html">David Bergland</a>.</p>

<title>CityVote Results</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: November 7, 1995 -->
</head>

<h1>CityVote</h1>

<p><img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.cityvote.org/cityvote/home.htm">CityVote</a> was
a presidential preference primary held November 7, 1995
in seventeen cities across the United States. As a preference primary, CityVote
was nonbinding, that is, more a poll than anything else. However, as
actual 1995 voters were likely 1996 voters, it was an interesting poll.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most spectacular thing about CityVote was its abject
failure. Intended to focus the 1996 presidential campaigns on "urban
issues" such as poverty and crime, CityVote was almost completely
ignored by the major presidential candidates. Several of the cities that
participated were fairly small towns, including Fayette,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mo/">Missouri</a> and
Greenburgh,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/">New York</a>.
None of the major metropolises participated --
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/NewYorkCity.html">New York
City</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/LosAngeles.html">Los
Angeles</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>,
<A href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/SanFrancisco.html">San
Francisco</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/Houston.html">Houston</a>
etc. were all absent.</p>

<p>From a Libertarian point of view, the most significant aspect of
CityVote was that Libertarian Harry Browne qualified for it. CityVote
candidates were required to meet stringent criteria before being allowed
on the ballot and into the debates.</p>

<p>Browne won 0.94% of the total vote, placing eleventh in a field of
21. Browne did noticeably better in cities where he campaigned personally,
getting 5.1% in Fayette,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mo/">Missouri</a>;
2.2% in Boulder,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/co/">Colorado</a>; and 1.6% in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/Tucson.html">Tucson</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/az/">Arizona</a>.</p>

<p>In almost every city, the top three vote-getters were Bill Clinton,
Colin Powell and Bob Dole in that order, with Clinton usually having a
sizable lead over his next competitor. Burlington,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/vt/">Vermont</a>, the city
that elected a Socialist mayor and then sent him to Congress, gave
Jesse Jackson the third highest rank. Fayette, Missouri, for some reason,
gave transcendental meditator John Hagelin of the Natural Law Party
the third spot. Tucson, Arizona gave capitalist tool Steve Forbes third
ranking.</p>

<p><a href="cv_results.html">Complete voting results</a> are
available.</p>

<title>1996 New Hampshire Primary</title>
<!-- Place: New Hampshire (USA) -->
<!-- Time: February 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>1996 New Hampshire Presidential Primaries</h1>

<p>In February 1996,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire</a> held
its first-in-the-nation presidential primaries. The
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a> held its
second ever New Hampshire presidential primary, and the first one to be
contested, although the primary was a preference primary with no bearing
on delegate selection. Of 304,904 ballots cast in the primaries,
1,642 (0.5%) were cast in the Libertarian primary, a voter turnout of about
47% of registered Libertarians. The final results were:</p>

<table border>
<tr><th>Candidate</th>		<th>#Votes</th>	<th>%Votes</th></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/revolution/by_name/B/HarryBrowne.html">Harry Browne</a></td>
	<td>661</td>	<td>40.3%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Other</td>		<td>359</td>	<td>21.8%</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="/revolution/by_name/S/IrwinSchiff.html">Irwin Schiff</a></td>
	<td>343</td>	<td>20.9%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pat Buchanan</td>	<td>176</td>	<td>10.7%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Steve Forbes</td>	<td>103</td>	<td>6.3%</td></tr>
<tr><th>Total</th>		<th>1,642</th>	<th>100%</th></tr>
</table>

<p>Browne and Schiff were the only candidates to register for the
Libertarian primary. Buchanan, Forbes and "Other" were write-ins.
Write-ins are counted separately only if running in another party's
primary.</p>

<p>In other parties' primaries, populist Pat Buchanan won the Republican
Party primary, and incumbent Bill Clinton overwhelmingly won the Democratic
Party primary.</p>

<title>Ernsberger on the Howard Stern Convention</title>
<!-- Place: Albany, New York (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 23, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>LPNY 1993 Nominating Convention</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/E/DonErnsberger.html">Don
Ernsberger</a>:</p>

<p>This morning (Saturday April 23rd) I drove 4.5 hours to
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/Albany.html">Albany</a> to
attend the
New York Free Libertarian Party convention. I had been asked to serve as
Parliamentarian by State chair Vogel as well as
<a href="/revolution/by_name/C/TamaraClark.html">Tamara Clark</a>. By 8:00 AM
several hundred LP members as well as many "Howard Stern fans" had gathered at
the convention location.</p>

<p>The New York LPers had arranged an efficient registration system requiring a
letter for admission to the Hall as well as traditional registration process.
By 9:30 when Howard Stern and his staff arrived over 250 certified delegates
had been registered and had taken their place in the hall. Over 130 members
of the media were also present. Tamara Clark and the local LP group had
arranged a press room and a well organized media/press effort occured. Stern's 
arrival generated a "pep rally" atmosphere outside the hall and the
convention kicked off at 10:00 AM. In addition to the efforts of the New
York LP activists, volunteers from
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/">Pennsylvania</a>
(<a href="/revolution/by_name/F/JohnFamularo.html">John Famularo</a>, Tom
Brennen, Rick Schwartz and Jay Russell) helped keep the sessions orderly.
National Director and Communications Director: <a
href="/revolution/by_name/W/PerryWillis.html">Willis</a> and <a
href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWinter.html">Winter</a> were also
there to work with the media.</p>

<p>At 10:00 the credentials committee reported 372 eligible delegates with
<em>no</em> contested delegate slots. The credentals committee report was
accepted
by the body and the report of secretary concerning the six announced
candidates for governor was accepted. Nominations and seconds for the six
candidates were made and the convention heard a 12 minute presentation by
each candidate.</p>

<p>Inside the hall were about 130 press, 372 delegates, and about 50 staff and
observers. Outside the hall were another 200 or so Stern Fans.</p>

<p>The Stern supporters ranged from many "small l" libertarians to many who
were
only interested in book autographs and being fans. The convention plans were
to have all votes by paper ballot. At the opening of the vote a motion from
the floor was made to have a standing counted vote. This motion passed but
the protests of various delegates and candidates resulted in a substitution
of voting in alphabetic order by paper ballot.</p>

<p>The result of the first ballot was Howard Stern with 287 (253 needed to
nominate). The other candidate vote totals ranged from about 35 for Jim
Ostrowski to about 25 for Norma Segel to about 10 for Joe Brennen and
Dottie Lou Brokaw.</p>

<p>No clear favorite had emerged from long time LP activists. In his acceptance
speech, Howard Stern urged party unity and asked the delegates to pick his
choice for Lt. Gov. Stan Dworkin. Amid protests from a number of long time
LP activists regarding this choice, the body selected Stern's suggestion.</p>

<p>Dworkin is a former Democratic County offical who is pro-choice on abortion;
pledged to the death penalty, legalized gambling, and lower taxes. He voiced 
support for "studying the case for legalized marijuana". He appears to favor
"Jack Kemp like" economic reforms. Many LP activists do not regard him as a
"libertarian" however.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how the media covers this convention and the effect of
the Stern selections on the long term LP activists. Some saw the convention
as a "Stern takeover" ... a takeover by non-libertarians. Others saw it as a
chance to gain ballot status and massive publicity.</p>

<p>I personally found the typical "Stern supporter" to be both more libertarian
<em>and</em> more well behaved then I had expected. Howard Stern also impressed
many as being more serious and concerned with LP growth then expected.</p>

<title>Horwitz on the Howard Stern Convention</title>
<!-- Place: Albany, New York (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 23, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>LPNY 1993 Nominating Convention</h1>

<p>From Nathan Horwitz:</p>

<p>I've just read my mail and it seems that I am the only person on
Libernet who actually attended the NYLP convention. I'll try to clear up
some errors I've read in previous posts and give a short description of
what it was like.</p>

<p>First of all, there were a number of mentions of someone named "Flanner"
or "Flanz". In actuality, they were referring to Dr. Robert Flanzer who is a
longtime party activist and was our candidate for controller as part of the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/T/JeromeTuccille.html">Tuccille</a> for Governor
ticket in 1971. He never said (as has been reported)
that he would leave the party if Stern were selected, although he did make
mention of others who did say that. (Although he may have said that to some
reporter privately, I don't think that Dr. Flanzer is capable of leaving the
party.)</p>

<p>It's also been reported that Stern won 297-34. This is not an accurate
account. It's true that the #2 candidate only recieved 34 votes, but a few
other candidates were very close to this figure as well. (Ostrowski got 34;
Dottie-Lou Brokaw & Norma "108K" Segal both scored in the 20's) Stern himself
recieved 287. Combined, Howards opponents got about 100 votes.</p>

<p>Every article I have seen makes mention of "scantily clad women." There
was one woman who wore a shirt and a thong bikini all day. Another woman
stripped down to a thong bikini for about five minutes after it was announced
that Stern had won. Most of the women there were not dressed professionally
but they did keep thier clothes on.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got to the Italian American center (in Colonie NY, a suburb
of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/Albany.html">Albany</a>)
a little before 7am. There were a few other local Libertarians
there and about thirty people who seemed to be Stern fans. I passed out copys
of the world's smallest political quiz to everyone who would take them.</p>

<p>Things started to get going around 8am. The doors opened and we set up
inside. People and press started to arrive. People were asked at the door if
they were members. If they said yes, they were allowed inside where a more
thorough check was made. Every one was given a packet as they went in. It
had a nametag in it, but mostly was full of ads for various Libertarian
groups; <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LaissezFaire.html">Laissez-Faire
books</a>, <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/Reason.html"><cite>Reason</cite></a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_name/F/FFF.html"><cite>Freedom Daily</cite></a>,
etc.</p>

<p>Howard Stern came in at about 10 AM with his gang. I'm not familiar
with who these people are, but I got the impression that all of his usual
sidekicks were with him. The only ones I recognized were David Peel and Tiny
Tim. The place went temporarily crazy and got very noisy, but it quieted
down soon enough. (Except for a couple of idiots who continued to shout out
bizare things like "Howard is God.")</p>

<p>Local resident and main convention organizer Jeff Russel started off
speaking with a bunch of Thank yous to us local people. Rebecca Wilber (the
only elected Libertarian in NY) gave the Keynote adress. Both of these were
difficult to hear as it was still noisy in the place and the press had
swarmed around Howard Stern in the back of the room.</p>

<p>Then State Chair Ludwig Vogel spoke. This was followed by the nominating
speeches for the candidates. Part of this I missed because I went outside
to hand out literature to the people who couldn't get in. Sandy Feld gave
a nice speech before nominating Norma Segal. The nominating speech for Stern
was given by someone named "Elephant boy".</p>

<p>Norma Segal gave a great talk about gun rights. Dottie Lou Brokaw gave
an excellent speech welcoming in the new members, and the dropped out of the
race. Howard Stern was surprisingly polite and seemed truly sincere. People
screamed like crazy every time he spoke. He was followed by Jim Ostrowski
who mostly talked about drug legalization and how much he hates Mario Cuomo.
This got him some cheers but he also got some boos. I think his sense of
humor was too low key and subtle for the Stern crowd.</p>

<p>Then there was a big fight about voting. Vogel favored a voice vote.
Others wanted a head count. What we finally did was a paper ballot, but it
was handled so badly that I'm not sure if it was any better than the first
two choices. At first, they had eight of us sitting by voting booths (mine
was for the letters A & B) and we were supposed to check off people's names
as they voted.</p>

<p>Then <a href="/revolution/by_name/E/DonErnsberger.html">Don Ernsberger</a>
(from the national LP-whose main job was to stand
around and seem self important as far as I could tell) took away the lists.
Instead of voting row by row, it was decided that they would call peoples names
out to let them vote! No one monitored if people were voting only once or not.
I could have voted many times if I wanted to. Eventually, this system broke
down to "EVERYBODY WHO'S NAME BEGINS WITH "L" SHOULD NOW VOTE."</p>

<p>This took quite a while. Throughout this time I was pleased to note how
respectful (!surprise!) Howard Stern had been. He spoke when it was his turn
and didn't make fun of the small size of the party. (and that would have been
very easy-the reason the days events had to end at four was because there was a
wedding later that night at the Italian American center. Can you imagine that
happening to the republicans?) I was also impressed with most of Stern's fans.
True, many were rude and obnoxious, but most listened attentively to the other
speeches and cheered in the right spots....the press though, what a rude,
unruly, disrespectful and badly behaved bunch they were! (there were a lot of
them-about one third of the attendees were in the press corps.)</p>

<p>Of course, Stern won. Things were OK up to this point, but got ugly when
it came time to pick Liuetenant Governor. We ended up picking Stern's hand
picked running mate, Stan Dworkin. It was done by voice vote and it definately
had that railroaded through feeling. There were some bad moments, like when
Vogel and Flanzer were fighting via microphone. Another bad moment came when
Dottie Lou Brokaw stepped aside as nomineee for lg. She endorsed Dworkin and
some older LPers seemed to see this as a sell out.</p>

<p>Things only got worse when Dworkin spoke. He only spoke briefly, but he
certainly did not seem like a Libertarian. He sounded like your typical
opportunist-no values politician whose only goal is personal political
advancement.</p>

<p>A few hours later we reconvened at The Ramada hotel for our banquet. I
won't go into that much, but in a poll that went around asking people at
the banquet who they voted for Ostrowski came in first, followed by Stern,
Segal, Brokaw, and Brennan. Stern was not at the banquet. The people at the
banquet were mostly the "old" LPers. As far as I could tell there were only
four "new" LPers there.</p>

<p>The next day (today, Sunday) the business meeting started out by removing
Vogel from presiding over the meeting.I guess the members must have been pretty
upset with him about everything. This was borne out when he later lost
reelection (to Gail Bova) by about a three to one margin. (for State Chair)
I won't bore you with all the details, but there was a movement to end the
convention on the grounds that we no longer had a quorum.</p>

<p>We chose Norma Segal to run for senate against Moynihan. James Conti was
probably the candidate who sounded the best-he was our choice for attorney
general, and Ed Geyer (who was not there!) is our candidate for controller.</p>

<p>Joe Brennan and Dottie Lou Brokaw won as the two vice chairs.</p>

<p>I can't remember who all the at-large comittee members are (Rich Moroney
and Fred Cookinham are two of them) but I thought it was interesting that
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/Buffalo.html">Buffalo</a>
 resident and non-Stern fan Ostrowski as well as new party member,
Buffalo resident and strong Stern supporter (with the unlikely name of) Jerry
Lewis both were elected at large.(The two had been arguing for a while during
the banquet.)</p>

<p>Well, thats all for now. I'll write back if there are new developments.</p>

<title>Chuck Wills on the Howard Stern Convention</title>
<!-- Place: Albany, New York (USA) -->
<!-- Time: April 23, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>LPNY 1993 Nominating Convention</h1>

<p>April 1994, From Chuck Wills (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a href="mailto:cwills@phantom.com">cwills@phantom.com</a>):</p>

<p>I was at the convention this weekend, and even though a lot of disturbing
things happened, I concur with M. Simkin in supporting Stern. (FYI, I've been
a paid-up member of the national LP for three years, the LPNY for two years,
and a Libertarian in spirit and in the voting booth since 1987. This was my
second LPNY convention. The opinions and reportage that follow are purely my
own.)</p>

<p>All of the news coverage played up the "invasion of the barbarians" aspect
of the convention, i.e. hordes of unwashed Stern fans rape and pillage tiny,
staid fringe political party.  In one story, Howard's assistant, Gary
Dell'Abate (AKA "Bababooie") was quoted as saying, "We disrupted their
chess-club meeting." When I read that, I felt annoyed. On reflection, though,
there's a lot of truth even in this snide statement.</a>

<p>Let's face it, most of us committed Libertarians spend too much time
debating the finer points of <a
href="/revolution/by_name/M/LudwigvonMises.html">Von Mises</a> and
relentlessly holding ourselves and
our candidates to inflexible standards of ideological purity. I believe that
if we're serious about advancing our cause and halting the erosion of freedom
of this country, we've got to (1) actually elect candidates, or at least rack
up vote totals that will force the press, public, and RepoCrat regulars to
pay some attention to us and our ideas; (2) focus on specific issues and
real-world solutions to the problems ordinary voters care about, instead of
just repeating the same old cliches to the same old clique of LP loyalists;
and (3) start acting like a real political party and not a little gang of
fellow-travelers. </p>

<p>Furthermore, I'm enough of an optimist to believe that most Americans (or
at least those not totally brainwashed by the left-centrist media) are
fundamentally Libertarian-they just don't realize it. We have to get our
ideas and policies out in the open and spread them to the widest possible
audience. If we can reach these people and explain what we stand for, we
might just get the groundswell of public support we need to become a viable
third party. The Stern candidacy, flawed as it is, could be a decisive
step-maybe even <em>the</em> decisive step-in this direction.</p>

<p>I say "could be" because, based on what I saw and heard in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/Albany.html">Albany</a>, a lot
depends on Stern's sincerity. I have to admit that Howard went out of his way
to reassure the LP loyalists that he wasn't just hijacking the party to get
the nod. While he was far from specific, he repeatedly said that he was not
just serious about running for governor, but that he was serious about
running as a Libertarian; that in his administration "the Libertarian
viewpoint would be heard"; and that he would appoint Libertarians to office
when elected. (I have to say that Howard actually appears to believe he can
win!) He also told the LP regulars that he was depending on their support.
Finally, Stern called for the regulars to work with the newly-minted Sternite
Libertarians, because, in his words, "these people are disenfranchised,
too."</p>

<p>Again, this is a statement that appears gratuitous at first but contains a
lot of truth. Most of the Sternites spent Saturday swilling beer, heckling
the LP regulars when they spoke, and ogling the "bikini babes" Howard brought
with him. But why are these people so obnoxious and nihilistic? Because, I
think, they realize in their guts that the present system in this state and
in this country is set up to screw them. They ARE disenfranchised; they know
the current political duopoly exists only to preserve and dispense power and
patronage. But they worship Stern and will follow where he leads. They would
support Howard if was running on the Socialist Workers Party ticket, but at
least Stern has brought these people into the political process even in a
peripheral way.</p>

<p>That said, I have no illusions that the vast majority of the Sternites
couldn't care less about the LP now that Stern has the nod. During the
convention, I heard the Sternites around me scoffing (to put it mildly) at
our support for second-amendment rights and even our anti-tax stance. (There
was a more positive response, as you might expect, when drug re-legalization
was mentioned.) But the fact is that Stern got around 400 people to plunk
down $15 and join the party-a rise in LPNY membership of between 50% and
100%, depending on whose figures you go by. We're fools if we don't at least
<em>try</em> to exploit this new resource. We probably can't hope to bring more
than a tiny percentage of the Sternites into the LP for the long haul, but for
a
party as small as ours, that's still a significant gain-and they say there's
no fanatic like the convert. </p>

<p>If I was the new state chair, I would get the membership list, analyze it
to separate the members who joined before March 31 (i.e. the Sternites) from
the LP loyalists, and "assign" ten of the former to each of the latter, with
a request that the loyalists call the new members, explain Libertarianism to
them, send them literature, and do whatever they can to get them on board for
real. Let's stop preaching to the choir and go out in streets among the
sinners.</p>

<p>Still, Howard's actions over the next seven months will do the most to
determine how the LPNY weathers this publicity hurricane. I heard party
loyalists voice the suspicion that Howard really is just exploiting the LP as
a vehicle to get publicity for himself and his show. Now that he's got the
nomination, the argument goes, he sees us as nothing more than useful dweebs
who will do the paperwork and legwork of the campaign. After all, he wasted
no time bundling himself and his entourage onto the bus after the nominating
process ended. "If he's so serious," said a prominent LP loyalist at the
Sunday business meeting "then why isn't here now?" Another pointed out that
Howard could at least have let real Libertarians put his name in nomination,
instead of two "wack pack" members, one of whom capped his incoherent
nominating speech by waving a plastic dildo from the dais. </p>

<p>These are valid points. Stern may come out on his radio show tomorrow and
slam the LP to his 20 million viewers. Or he may do the opposite. We'll just
have to see. Howard certainly gave a good impression of sincerity on
Saturday. But we all know how volatile and egocentric he is (and I say this
as longtime fan). </p>

<p>Of course, most of the LP regulars were at least resigned to Stern's
nomination. That was a foregone conclusion the minute Howard instructed his
radio audience to join up and come to Albany. The <em>real</em> drama of the
convention centered on the lieutenant-governor nomination.</p>

<p>The loyalists would have felt a lot better about Stern if he had allowed a
"real" major-league Libertarian (i.e., Segal, Brennan, Ostrowski, Brokaw) to
get the number 2 spot-especially as Howard is stating he'll resign as soon as
he gets his three-issue agenda through the legislature. But from the minute
he got on the dais, Howard relentlessly pushed his "hand-picked" running
mate, Stan Dworkin. And who is this guy? An obscure former Rockland County
legislator (a Democrat, I believe) who only joined the party on the day of
the convention.</p>

<p>From what I understand, Stern latched onto Dworkin (or vice-versa) because
the LP just couldn't shake Stern's belief that he had to have a "real"
politician on the ticket for his candidacy to be taken seriously. Dworkin
certainly doesn't know anything about us or what we stand for. Some hardcore
LP'ers demanded he speak a couple of times so we could at least get a sense
of where he stands. He talked about cutting waste and fraud, getting
government and "private industry" to work together, and so on-the standard
stump speech given by every politician from Clinton on down to your local
candidate for dog catcher. </p>

<p>Most of the loyalists were steady through the balloting for Stern, but when
Stern asked the convention to nominate Dworkin by acclamation so he could
leave the convention "in triumph" (his phrase), things got tense and ugly.
The word "putsch" was spoken. But in the end, Stern had more than enough
followers in the hall to get Dworkin onto the ticket in a voice vote. </p>

<p>In an obvious attempt at damage control-I think several hard-core LP'ers
were on the point of walking out-Dottie-Lou Brokaw said that Dworkin had
agreed to meet with her and learn more about Libertarianism. Unfortunately,
this was just before he made some particularly lame statements to the floor.
At the banquet that night, addressing and audience of (mostly) LP loyalists,
she expressed some regrets over throwing her support to Dworkin.</p>

<p>As with Stern, we'll just have to adopt a wait-and-see,
benefit-of-the-doubt attitude with regard to Dworkin. In a conversation with
me, one LP'er noted that Dworkin must have <em>something</em> motivating him to
leave his party and throw in with Stern and the LP. Maybe it's a
dissatisfaction
with mainstream politics that will translate into real Libertarianism. Or he
could simply be hoping for a ride past the press on Howard's coattails. </p>

<p>Finally, I think we NY LP'ers ought to remember Jefferson's comment on the
necessity of a little rebellion now and then. This is the biggest thing ever
to hit our poky little party. We may come out of it discredited publicly, we
run the risk of being torn apart internally, but the Sternite "rebellion" has
put the L-word in the public's eye, and I believe that in the long term this
will be to our benefit. </p>

<p>And at least things are interesting! It's as if the LPNY has been struck by
a bolt of lightning . I was at the 1993 convention, when all the delegates
fit into a conference room at the White Plains Hotel with room to spare.  If
anyone had said to me then that a thousand people would show up the next
convention, and that I'd see Lu Vogel and Joe Brennan sharing a dais with
Robin Quivers and Stuttering John Melendez, and that Howard Stern would be
nominated for governor, I would have said they were nuts. But it happened.</p>

<p>"I had a blast," said an LP regular to me on Saturday night. "I've been to
a lot of conventions, and this is the first time I've been to an LP
convention that felt like a <em>real</em> political convention." Amen.</p>

<h1>Libertarian Activism: Strategy and Tactics</h1>

<p>Sometime around 1991, Libertarian activist
<a href="/revolution/by_name/I/TomIsenberg.html">Tom Isenberg</a> began
a series of tips, tactics, strategies, and case studies that became
known as "Tom's Tips" and proved invaluable to activists across
the country trying to learn how to grow their parties and run
campaigns. This web page has grown from that effort and now includes
articles from many people.</p>

<p>The premier resource for Libertarian activists is the outstanding
newsletter <cite>Libertarian Volunteer</cite>, edited by LP Communications
Director <a href="/revolution/by_name/W/BillWinter.html">Bill Winter</a>.
It is simply the best newsletter in the libertarian movement. It is
written for LP volunteers, activists, officers, and candidates. If you are
one of those, send your request to Bill Winter to get on that mailing
list.</p>

<title>Hong Kong's Economic Policies</title>
<!-- Place: Hong Kong -->
<!-- Time: report 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Hong Kong's Economic Policies</h1>

<p>1993, from Daniel Lam of Melbourne, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Oceania/Australia/">Australia</a>:</p>

<p>Well, I was born in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/HongKong/">Hong Kong</a> and visited there
last month.</p>

<p>I know of no convenient reference for finding out about HK economic
policies, but you can always try the HK government, I guess.  Here I
will just present some facts which I discovered while there.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Free Trade. There are no protective tariffs. There are import duties on a
few items for revenue purposes, alcohol and cigarettes, I think. Duties on
cosmetics was abolished on April 1, when the new budget came into effect.</p>

<li><p>Personal Income Tax. There is tax-free allowance of HK$56000 (about
US$7000). For income above that there is a single rate (I think) of about
15%.</p>

<li><p>Welfare. There is no social security scheme, and no unemployment benefits.
The only form of direct welfare I can think of which exists is old-age
pensions.</p>

<li><p>Economy. Unemployment is less than 2%. The "world-wide economic recession"
which mysteriously hit the world despite the best efforts of governments to
protect their peoples seems to have missed Hong Kong, whose government was
grossly negligent and didn't do a thing.</p>

<li><p>Labour laws. There are no minimum-wage laws like in the U.S., or, worse
still, the kind of centralized arbitration we have in Australia. There are
some laws and regulations governing safety and the like.</p>

<li><p>Health. There are public hospitals where very cheap subsidized health
care is available. There is no state health insurance scheme, nothing like
Medicaid or Medicare. If you want to get (almost) free health care, you go to
a public hospital and join the queue. If you go to a private doctor, you pay.
I should also say that the HK Medical Association, like the AMA, controls the
registration of doctors.</p>

<li><p>Education. There is compulsory education up until an age which I don't
remember. There are public schools and private schools but most schools are
privately run religious schools subsidized by the government.</p>

<li><p>Guns. HK has draconian gun-control laws. It is a British colony, after
all.</p>

<li><p>ID cards. All HK residents are required to have and carry with them a HK
identity card. Visitors are "advised" to carry identification with them. This
measure is intended to catch illegal immigrants from <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/China/">China</a>, who are sent back
immediately, unless they claim asylum or refugee status and succeed.</p>

<li><p>Housing. A lot of people (something like 25%) live in government housing,
although the government is trying to move them to private housing. This doesn't
stop the private real estate market from boiling constantly. Real estate is
extremely expensive, and is rising constantly. Almost everybody in HK lives in
a flat. Houses are only for the fabulously rich. I had great difficulty in
comprehending the notion of a "suburb" when I first came to Australia.</p>

<li><p>Shopping. This is the most important thing. There are no restrictions on
hours of trading. Shops are open on weekends and late into the night.</p>

</ol>

<p>As you can see from this list, HK has a very high degree of economic freedom,
and quite good personal freedom, excellent compared with its neighbours. Four
more years to go ...</p>

<title>Transition to Free Market</title>
<!-- Place: ? (USA) -->
<!-- Time: October 15, 1993 or 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Czech Transition from Communism to the Free Market</h1>

<p>Of the former Soviet bloc nations, the Czech Republic has made
the most progress towards tranforming its economy into a free market,
and became the only nation in the world whose Prime Minister was
an Austrian school economist. "Coincidentally" it is also the most
prosperous of formerly communist nations as well as the one with
the most vibrant culture.</p>

<h2>How to Move Boldly Towards Freedom</h2>

<p>The following remarks were made by
<A href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/CzechRepublic/">Czech</a> Prime Minister
<a href="/revolution/by_name/K/VaclavKlaus.html">Vaclav Klaus</a> on
October 15th, 1993 or 1994 in a speech at the Heritage Foundation.</p>

<p>I believe that the Czech Republic has already crossed the 
Rubicon dividing the old and the new regime. We may become 
the proof that the transformation from communism to a free 
society can be realized.</p>

<p>The systemic transformation is not an exercise in applied 
economics or in applied political science; it is a process 
which involves human beings, which affects their day-to-day 
life, which creates new groups of gainers and losers, which 
changes the relative political and economic strength and 
standing of different socio-economic groups and which, 
therefore, destroys the original political, social and 
economic equilibrium.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To be successful, the political leaders must formulate and 
sell to the citizens of the country a positive vision of a 
future society. The first task is its formulation; the vision 
must be positive (not just a negative one); it must be 
straight-forward; it must motivate; it must speak to the 
hearts of the men and women who spent most of their lives in 
the spiritually empty communist regime. The second task, to 
sell the vision, is much more complicated. It requires to 
address the people, to argue, to explain, to defend; it 
requires permanent campaigning. It requires more than a good 
communication system, more than sophisticated information 
technology, more than free and independent mass media. It 
requires the formation of standard political parties because 
without them the politicians have no real power base. </p>

<li><p>The necessary set of reform steps includes both changes of 
institutions and changes of behavioral and regulatory rules. 
Institutional changes take time, changes of rules, however, 
can and must be done very fast. Much of the disagreement 
about the speed of transformation (shock-therapy or 
gradualism) can be dispelled if a proper distinction is made 
between the speed of those two conceptually different 
transformation tasks. </p>

<li><p>Such a fundamental change of an entire society cannot be 
dictated by a priori, prearranged procedures. Reform 
blueprints must be loose, unpretentious and flexible. The 
dreams of social engineers of all ideological colors to 
organize or to mastermind the whole process of a systemic 
transformation in a rigid way are false, misleading, and 
dangerous. It must be accepted - as an important 
transformation theorem - that it is impossible to centrally 
plan the origin and rise of a free society and of a market economy. </p>

<li><p>The reforms must be bold, courageous, determined, and, 
therefore, painful, because </p>
	<ul>
	<li>Economic activities based on subsidized prices, on 
	artificially created and now nonexistent demands, and on 
	sheltered markets must cease to exist;
	<li>Once-and-for-all price jump after price deregulation is unavoidable;
	<li>Drastic devaluation, inevitable to be introduced before 
	liberalization of foreign trade, shifts the exchange rate 
	very far below the purchasing power parity;
	<li>Income and property disparities grow to an unprecedented level, etc.
	</ul>
</ol>

<p>The costs the people have to bear must be widely shared, 
otherwise the fragile political support is lost. Telling the 
truth, not promising things which cannot be realized, and 
guarding credibility of reform programs and of politicians 
who realize them, are absolute imperatives.</p>

<h2>The Reality of Compromise</h2>

<p>In June 1996 elections, Klaus' free-market Civic Democratic Party (ODS)
fell two seats short of a majority in the Czech parliament. The
second-place Social Democrats, a traditional European welfare state
party, will slow down the liberalization of the Czech economy.</p>

<p>The four major Czech parties accepted an agreement in which the
Social Democrats lead parliament in return for support of a minority
government of the center-right coalition of the other parties. Klaus
will remain prime minister.</p>

<p>The Social Democrats oppose privatization of state-owned utility
and transportation networks, and want more government involvement
in pensions, health care and education.</p>

<title>Russia Rejects Democracy</title>
<!-- Place: Russia -->
<!-- Time: 1990s; commission resigns February 5, 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Russia Returns to Communism</h1>

<h2>The Fall of Communism</h2>

<p>Communism destroyed the Soviet Empire. The parasite of socialism
finally drained the last blood from the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Russia/">Russian</a> nation in the late
1980's and 1990's, resulting in a spectacular break-up of Soviet
control.</p>

<p>But freedom did not take hold in Russia. Instead of forging ahead
with property rights and free markets, Russians devolved into a
collection of turf wars, with ethnic groups, former rulers, entrepreneurs,
organized crime and various other groups competing to survive.</p>

<p>Out of the former Soviet-controlled states, the one that proceeded
fastest and furthest with free-market reform -- the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/CzechRepublic/">Czech Republic</a> --
has done the best economically by far. The ones that at least moved
closer to free markets, including Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Poland,
are doing alright.</p>

<p>Russia, who moved least to free markets, whose economy continued to be
based on payoffs, bribes and tribute, has (surprise) done the worst
economically and culturally. Yet this catastrophe is often blamed on moving
<em>too fast</em> with economic reforms! The blindness, willful or
otherwise, of international commentators continues to astound me.</p>

<h2>The Rise of Communism</h2>

<p>In the mid-1990's, Russia began a decided move back towards
nationalism and communism. President Boris Yeltsin abandoned democratic
allies to appease former hardliners, and imposed numerous crackdowns
on civil liberties.</p>

<p>On February 5, 1996, four members of Russia's presidential human
rights commission resigned, releasing what is likely the commission's
final report. The head of the commission resigned in January and another
member announced plans to resign, leaving only three members on the
commission.</p>

<p>The report said that human rights violations are common is Russia,
that Russia is moving from democracy back to totalitarianism, that
Russia is becoming increasingly militarized, and
that Yeltsin is tolerating the abuses. Examples of human rights abuses
included ethnic hatred, anti-Semitism, xenophobia,
mistreatment of servicemen and prison inmates, free speech restrictions,
government disinformation, war abuses in
<a href="/revolution/multi/war/chechnya.html">Chechnya</a>,
and the renewal of the Soviet practice of issuing residence permits
restricting free movement.</p>

commission reports gross violations, practically disbands," reprinted

<title>Market Process Theory</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Market Process Theory</h1>

<p>This overview of the Austrian school of economics' theory of
entrepreneurship was originally a college paper by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/KenGaillotJr.html">Ken Gaillot</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>The study of economics is based on the premise that there exists
a regularity in economic phenomena, laws as inescapable as the law
of gravity. Economic theory seeks to establish these laws. One
essential aspect of economic theory, the theory of the market, tries
to explain the relationships observed under a system of private
property. Although most economists today follow an equilibrium approach
to market theory, the body of market theory associated with the Austrian
school provides a better understanding of market processes, being
able to explain events that equilibrium analysis cannot.</p>

<p>The Austrian theory of the market is one of market process, of
action, change and uncertainty. Exponents of Austrian economics,
also called subjectivist economics, explain economic activity in
terms of its ultimate cause, purposeful human action. Austrians
believe an economic theory is valid for situations in which its
assumptions are present, if the theory is logically consistent.</p>

<p>Conventional neoclassical equilibrium analysis takes a fundamentally
different approach. Reality is to be modeled, as it is in the natural
sciences, tested against empirical data, and refined if necessary.
Models make assumptions to simplify reality and focus on areas of
interest. An economic theory is valid for reality if the results it
predicts are present in the situation and the theory is logically
consistent.</p>

<title>Air Control Dangers</title>
<!-- Time: September 1994 - August 1995 -->
<!-- Place: USA -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Government-run Air Control Dangerous</h1>

<p>The deregulated, private, competitive U.S. airlines are the envy of the
world when it comes to safety, state-of-the-art technology and affordability.
But the government-run U.S. air traffic control system is in a shambles,
relying on quarter-century old computer equipment and suffering major
personnel problems.</p>

<p>Air traffic control computers are long overdue for replacement, some being
more than twenty-five years old. Some are so old that replacement parts are
unavailable. Despite this, the Federal Aviation
Administration is cutting back on its maintenance budget, eliminating
training and cutting back on hiring.</p>

<p>In some centers, half the technicians are eligible to retire. Because of
planned reductions in benefits, many will retire in the next year or two.</p>

<p>Air traffic control centers have experienced major trouble relating to
their computer and personnel problems. Although the problems have not yet
caused a crash, they have caused delays costing millions of dollars.
The FAA counted eleven failures between September 1994 and
August 1995.</p>

<p>On-board collision-avoidance systems were the only savior of two
American Airlines passenger planes led by faulty controller information
towards a head-on collision.</p>

<p>Other problems have included "ghost targets" (planes that exist only on
air traffic control screens), real planes that don't show up on screen and
frequent flickers.</p>

<p>Government is simply not an efficient producer of consumer products,
whether food, health care or air traffic control. U.S. air traffic control
will be the envy of the world when it is run by U.S. businesses and not the
U.S. government.</p>

<title>Sky's the Limit</title>
<!-- Place: Montana (USA) -->
<!-- Time: December 1995 -->

<body>

<h1>Montana Ends Speed Limit</h1>

<p>Before 1973, highway speed limits were properly the realm of individual
states. The states owned the roads, the Constitution did not say anything
about speed limits, so the states set the speed limits.</p>

<p>In 1973, as part of the creeping slime-mold-like growth of the
federal government, the U.S. Congress mandated a national 55 mile per hour
speed limit in response to a supposed oil crisis. When the oil "crisis"
went away with deregulation of oil prices, the speed limit stayed, with
the new rationale of "saving lives." (Of course, zero miles per hour would
save even more lives.)</p>

<p>In 1995, Congress finally repealed the national speed limit, once
again leaving the matter up to the states. In December 1995,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mt/">Montana</a>
became the first state to repeal the daytime speed limit on major
highways altogether.</p>

<p>Montana law currently sets a nighttime speed limit of 65 mph, and
a daytime speed limit of "reasonable and proper" (as defined by patrolmen,
subject to judges' and juries' review). Trucks are still limited to 65 mph
during the day and 55 at night. As to what is reasonable and proper,
one patrolman said, "Anything in triple digits is probably a ticket."
Probably.</p>

<p>Critics are worried that tires and engines will wear out more quickly,
and of course that the death rate will skyrocket as deer go flying through
windshields at 100mph. My advice to the critics: take the bus.</p>

<hr>

"With speed limits untied by Washington, drivers' eyes are on Montana,"

<h1>Planes, Trains and Automobiles: Humor</h1>

<hr>

<h2>O'Rourke on Car Safety</h2>

<p>A car used to be a simple piece of machinery, something like a very fast
rider mower but better because you couldn't mow the lawn with it. You started
this up, drove off at pretty much any speed you desired, and then exercised
a variety of constitutionally guaranteed liberties, usually by having sex and
accidents.</p>

<p>No more -- nowadays if a car cannot survive a fall from the Gateway Arch
and emits any vapors more noxious than Evening in Paris, the federal
government won't let you own it, and what they will let you own you can't
really drive, because fifty-five miles an hour is the speed at which a
spirited person parallel-parks, not motors to

<h2>Barry on Speed Limits</h2>

<p>I'd also like to see speed limits that take into account what song
you're listening to on the radio. Ideally, if a police officer pulled
you over for doing, say, 95 mph in a 75 zone, and you could prove
to him that you were listening to the Isley Brothers' version of
"Twist and Shout," he would not only have to let you off, but he would
also be required, by law, to sing along with you.</p>

<title>Butter Color Battle</title>

<h1>Butter Color Battle</h1>

<p>Three inevitabilities of government regulations:</p>
<ol>
<li>They will be used by established industries to restrict
    competition from newer industries and products.
<li>They attempt to micromanage the economy, delving into the
    simplest details of business operation.
<li>They are harder to kill than fleas in a dog pound.
</ol>

<p>In 1996, margarine makers lobbied the U.S. Congress to
repeal regulations nearly half a century old. The 1950 Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act requires margarine to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a tint or shade containing more than one and six-tenths degrees
of yellow, or yellow and red collectively, but with an excess of yellow
over red, measured in terms of Lovibond tintometer scale</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to color requirements, the federal government restricts
the size of margarine tubs and requires margarine-serving
restaurants to post signs warning their customers of the fact.
Before 1950, some states had even more ridiculous regulations. Dairy states,
wanting to restrict butter's competition, required margarine to be pink
or white.</p>

<p>"We want the same options that the butter people have, the cream cheese
people have and the jelly people have," said the executive
director of the National Margarine Manufacturers Association,
pushing for the Margarine Equity Act. Some margarine makers want
to lighten their color a bit.</p>

<h1>Quotes on Regulation</h1>

<hr>

<h2>The Simplicity of the Americans With Disabilities Act</h2>

<p>In 1996, John Stossel, journalist for the television news program "20/20",
interviewed Gilbert Casellas, the chairman of the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission on the topic of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
At one point their exchange went like this:</p>

<p><b>Casellas:</b> "The law's fairly clear, it's fairly simple."</p>

<p><b>Stossel:</b> "If you come to me applying for a job, and your
arm's in a sling, can I ask you why your arm is in a sling?"</p>

<p><b>Casellas:</b> "You can ask -- you know what? I'm going to
ask you to stop the tape ... we're getting into a complicated area ..."</p>

<p><b>Stossel:</b> "You run the EEOC, and you don't even understand
[the rules]? How's some employer in Iowa supposed to know them?"</p>

<title>Tax Resisteer Wins</title>
<!-- Place: Chattanooga, Tennessee (USA) -->
<!-- Time: case filed October 15, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Tax Resister Beats IRS</h1>

<p>Lloyd L. Long believes that the income tax is voluntary and refuses
to pay it. The IRS took him to court and lost.</p>

<p>As reported by Bill Keller in January 1994 in the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tn/Chattanooga.html">Chattanooga</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tn/">Tennessee</a>
<cite>Independence News Opinion</cite>, and by Lamarr Hardy in the Boise,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/id/">Idaho</a>-based
<cite>Alert</cite>, Long was defended by attorneys Lowell Becraft of Huntsville, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/al/">Alabama</a> and Russell J.
Leonard of Sewanee, Tennesee.</p>

<p>Long testified that, based on his study of the Internal Revenue Code
(Title 26), he believes the income tax is an excise tax applicable only
to certain persons, and not the majority of citizens (including himself).
Long says Internal Revenue Code Sections 1441-1443 applies the income tax
only to nonresident aliens and U.S. citizens living abroad in a country where
a tax treaty exists with the United States.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney Curtis Collier, representing the Internal Revenue Service,
took a different view. The IRS prosecuted Long for willfully failing to file
tax returns for 1989 and 1990 as "required by law."</p>

<p>Long admitted he had income in excess of $49,000 in each of those years and
that he did not file a return. <cite>Alert</cite> described the defense's
evidence that he was not required to do so:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Defense testimony showed a case titled <cite>Brushaber v. Union Pacific
Railroad</cite> wherein it was the unanimous decision of the U.S. Supreme
Court that the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution did not give Congress
any new power to tax any new subjects; it merely tried to simplify the
way in which the tax was imposed.  The ruling also showed that the income tax
was, in fact, an excise tax on corporate privileges and privileged
occupations.</p>

<p>The defense then brought out a case entitled <cite>Flint v.  Stone Tracy
Co.</cite> wherein an excise tax was defined as being a tax laid upon the
manufacture, sale and consumption of commodities within the country; upon
licenses to pursue certain occupations; and upon corporate privileges.</p>

<p>Long's attorneys also brought out a case entitled <cite>Simins v.
Arehns</cite> wherein the court ruled that the income tax was neither a
property tax nor a tax upon occupations of common right, but was an excise
tax.</p>

<p>Next the defense turned to the case of <cite>Redfield v.  Fisher</cite>.
In this instance, the court ruled that an individual, unlike the corporation,
cannot be taxed for the mere privilege of existing, but that the individual's
right to live and own property was a natural right upon which an excise
cannot be imposed.  Defense also pointed to several studies done by the
Congressional Research Service showing the income tax is an excise.</p>

<p>A Tennessee Supreme Court case, <cite>Jack Cole v.  Commissioner</cite>,
provided the fifth defense argument. Here, the court ruled that citizens are
entitled by right to income or earnings and that right could not be taxes as
a privilege.</p>

<p>Finally, Long's legal team pointed to another Tennessee Supreme Court
case, <cite>Corn v. Fort</cite>, in which the court ruled that individuals
have a right to combine their activities as partnerships; and that this is
a natural right, independent and antecedent of government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The defense presented additional arguments that the IRS knew no one
was liable for the income tax. Other IRS-administered taxes, such as the
alcohol tax, are very clearly worded as to who is liable. The IRS' Mission
Statement states that the income tax relies on "voluntary compliance."</p>

<p>Long had built a paper trail in his defense before the trial. He had
written letters asking the IRS direct questions such as, "Am I required to
file federal income tax returns?" and "Am I liable for federal income
taxes?" The IRS never directly answered Long's questions, at which point
Long stopped filing tax returns.</p>

<p>The jury found Long not guilty on all counts.</p>

<p>The Research Foundation provides information to individuals who want to
challenge the IRS. Write to Lamarr Hardy, Executive Director, The
Research Foundation, POB 29265, Honolulu, HI 96720.</p>

<p> This was Case Number CR-1-03-91, <cite>U.S. v. Lloyd Long</cite>, filed in
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Tennessee, October 15, 1993.

<title>Posse Comitatus Organization</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1930's - present -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Posse Comitatus</h1>

<p>February 19, 1995, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/G/IanGeldard.html">Ian
Geldard</a>:</p>

<p>There have been several recent references to the Posse Comitatus. In 
order to enlighten libernet readers a little further about them, I have 
drafted this little backgrounder. I have more information and would be 
happy to prepare a more detailed paper if there is sufficient interest 
(along with any corrections and additions that may come my way). Please 
note that I don't read libernet-d, and so any comments should be sent to 
me directly.</p>

<h2>The Posse Comitatus</h2>

<p>Posse Comitatus is (or was) an organisation composed of loosely
affiliated bands which have been around since 1969. The name Posse
Comitatus is Latin for "power of the county", and the Posse believes
that all government power is rooted at the county level.</p>

<p>Their ideology is largely based on the Posse Comitatus Act passed in
the wake of the Civil War specifically to bar the federal military
from interfering in local police matters. In response to President
Grant's post Civil War efforts to use troops to guard ballot boxes
and prevent election fraud, Congress had ordered that such police
powers rest only at the county level. Federal troops were barred from
enforcing domestic laws.</p>

<p>Modern Posse adherents assert that the Posse Comitatus principle means
that no citizen is bound to obey any authority higher than that of the
county sheriff. Paying income tax, making social security payments,
using license plates and driving licenses violate this principle.
Many, but not all Posse members also believe that the Posse doectrine
was divinely revealed by God and therefore to pay taxes is not only
illegal but sinful. Some of these "religious" Posse members are
associated with the "Identity" churches which believe, among other
things, that Jews are the spawn of Satan and that blacks are not
humans at all, but animals in disguise.</p>

<p>The formation of the Posse Comitatus "movement" has been traced to
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/or/Portland.html">Portland</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/or/">Oregon</a>, when a
retired dry-cleaning executive named Henry
Lamont "Mike" Beach formed the first Posse chapter, called the
Sherriff's Posse Comitatus (SPC) or Citizen's Law Enforcement Research
Committee (CLERC). Beach had been a controversial Pacific Northwest
right-winger ever since the early 1930s when he was a leader of a
group of American Hitler-worshippers who called themselves the Silver
Shirts <a href="#note">[1]</a>. At about the same time as the formation of the
SPC, retired Army Colonel William Potter Gale founded the US Christian
Posse Association in Glendale, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ca/">California</a>.</p>

<p>According to a 1986 report by analysts for the IRS, in the first
manual for the Posse, Beach wrote: [O]fficials of government who
commit criminal acts or who violate their oath of office ... shall be
removed by the posse to the most populated intersection of streets in
the township and, at high noon, be hung by the neck, the body
remaining until sundown as an example to those who would subvert the
law." The advisory went on to claim that "members associated with some
of the Posse groups wear tiny gold hangmen's nooses on their lapels."</p>

<p>Beginning in 1983, the Posse Comitatus became the focus of widespread
media attention when Gordon W. Kahl, a longtime Posse member allegedly
shot and killed two US marshals and wounded three other law
enforcement officers in a shootout near Medina,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nd/">North Dakota</a>. The two
marshals had been trying to arrest Kahl in an income tax case when the
shooting occured. Kahl became a fugitive, until he himself was shot
and killed by an
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ar/">Arkansas</a> sheriff.
In that shootout, when Kahl was
killed, the house in which he was hiding went up in flames as the
shots were said to have ignited "thousands of rounds of ammunition,"
and the sheriff was also killed.</p>

<h2><a name=note>Note</a></h2>

<p>[1] The Silver shirts were founded in Asheville,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nc/">North Carolina</a>, by
William Dudley Pelley, a New Englander of "uncontaminated English
Stock", in 1933, the day after Hitler came to power. His followers
dressed themselves in silver shirts, blue corduroy knickers and gold
stockings. I wonder what the Gestapo would have thought of them had
they turned up at a Nazi rally in Germany!</p>

<title>IRS Incompentence</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: report April 15, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>IRS Often Wrong</h1>

<p>April 15, 1995, from the <a href="/revolution/by_name/C/Cato.html">Cato
Institute</a>:</p>

<p>This year some 40 million Americans will clash with the Internal Revenue
Service.  In a new Cato Institute study, "Why You Can't Trust the IRS,"
author Daniel J. Pilla says in a rising number of these confrontations, the
taxpayer is right, and the $7.6 billion IRS is wrong.</p>

<p>In the study (Policy Analysis no. 222) Pilla finds that despite a doubling
of its budget over the past 10 years and a nearly 20 percent increase in
enforcement personnel, the IRS is increasingly incapable of administering
and enforcing the nation's tax law.</p>

<p>Pilla cites the following as among the reasons the IRS can no longer be 
trusted.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The IRS telephone taxpayer assistance program provides about 8.5
million Americans the wrong answer to even the most basic inquiries
about tax laws.</p>

<li><p>This year roughly 10 million Americans will receive correction
notices from the IRS assessing about $4 billion.  About half of
those notices will be erroneous.</p>

<li><p>About 40 percent of the revenues the IRS collects through penalty
assessments are abated when citizens challenge the penalties.  In 1993
taxpayers were overcharged $5 billion.</p>

<li><p>A General Accounting Office audit of the IRS in 1993 found
widespread evidence of financial malfeasance and gross negligence.
The IRS could not account for 64 percent of its congressional appropriation.</p>

</ul>

<p>Pilla says the IRS fails to meet the standards of financial accountability
and diligence that it imposes on the citizenry.  Since the IRS can no longer
adequately police itself, it can no longer be trusted with the authority to
police individual American businesses and taxpayers.</p>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>

<p>The time has come to abolish our complicated, intrusive and ineffective
income tax system.  Never before has the political will and popular mandate
converged in support for structural overhaul of our tax system.  Both
politicians and the public are now calling for a simplified, fair and
effective tax collection system.  Pilla says policymakers should act
now -- abolish the IRS and replace it with a national sales tax.</p>

<p>The study can be ordered for $4.00 from Cato Institute Books at
1-800-767-1241.</p>

<title>Austrian Economics</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Market Process</a></h1>
<h2>Austrian Economics</h2>

<p>Austrian economics is defined largely by its epistemology, that is,
what the Austrian economist considers to be valid knowledge and
valid methods of gaining knowledge. All the salient characteristics
of Austrian economics -- its subjectivism, its individualism, its
emphasis on purposeful action, its logical as opposed to mathematical
analysis -- follow from its epistemology.</p>

<p>Humans experience two worlds, the external world of natural phenomena,
and the internal world of thought, feeling and value. Purposeful human
action is the link between these two worlds: action directs means
in the external world in response to ends chosen by the mind in the
internal world. 'Purposeful human action' includes all action that is
chosen. Its opposite is involuntary reaction.</p>

<p>Corresponding to the two worlds are two types of knowledge.
Observation, or experimental knowledge, is valid if it accurately
describes the external world. The validity of experimentation depends
on repeatability of the experiment and ability to observe data in
the external world. Logic, or aprioristic knowledge, is valid if its
reasoning from assumptions to conclusions is correct and its
assumptions are true. Logical knowledge is not dependent on external
facts. For example, the Pythagorean theorem of geometry cannot be
proved or disproved by measuring triangles in the external world.
The theorem is inherently true from its assumptions.</p>

<p>To the Austrian economist, economics is part of a broader science
of purposeful human action. In particular, economics is the
study of what is universal about human action, of what will happen
whenever a given set of assumptions is present. History, by contrast,
is the study of what is specific about human action, of what happened
at a particular place and time. The methodology of Austrian economics
follows from this emphasis.</p>

<p>Because Austrian economics deals with human choice, Austrian economists
define economic concepts by the subjective intentions and beliefs of
acting individuals. An object has no value expect to an acting individual;
no object is a means unless considered such by an acting individual.
This methodological dualism or subjectivism leads to a skepticism of
mathematical approaches to economics, which assume economic quantities
can be directly measured in the external world. Collecting economic
statistics is, to Austrians, history and not economics:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If a statistician determines that a rise of 10 per cent in the
supply of potatoes in Atlantis at a definite time was followed by
a fall of 8 per cent in price, he does not establish anything about
what happened or may happen with a change in the supply of potatoes
in another country or at another time. He has not "measured" the
"elasticity of demand" of potatoes. He has established a unique
and individual historical fact. (<a
href="biblio.html#Mises">Mises</a>, pp. 55 - 56)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Austrian economist also assumes a methodological apriorism,
the gaining of knowledge by deductive reasoning from first principles,
and not experimental methods. Aprioristic knowledge is true when its
assumptions are true, so conclusions of economic theories can "never
be verified or falsified by reference to facts. All that we can and
must verify is the presence of our assumptions in the particular
case" (<a href="biblio.html#Hayek">Hayek</a>, p. 73). In economics,
knowledge gained by logic
accurately represents reality because the assumption of economic logic
-- human choice -- exists in reality.</p>

<p>Austrians reject the gaining of knowledge by experiment. Experimental
knowledge assumes repeatability, that is, the same set of initial
circumstances will always produce the same results. Economic events,
however, are not repeatable. Different people placed in the same
situation may behave differently, because each has the capacity to
choose. Even the same person placed in the same situation twice may
behave differently each time.</p>

<p>Austrians also reject experimental knowledge because experimental
knowledge assumes that data are directly observable. Austrians, however,
believe that economic concepts cannot be measured, because they are
subjectively present in the minds of acting individuals. Further,
'facts' about collective social entities such as markets are not single,
observable things but a collection of related events. The events must
be related by a pre-existing theory. For instance, what transactions
constitute the market for automobiles, what time span is short run, and
so forth, are facts that must be related according to prior knowledge
of what a market is. Economic theories are not about social facts,
but comprise them, and so can never be disproved by another social
fact (theory).</p>

<p>Another important component of Austrian methodology is a methodological
individualism. All action is taken by individuals, even when the
individuals are acting on behalf of a group. Thus Austrians trace economic
events back to their source in individual action.</p>

<p>The Austrian economist sees his task as deducing the implications of
human choice under conditions observed in the real world. The assumptions
of economic theory are the point at which the theory is empirically
verifiable. This approach allows qualitative prediction of economic
events, explanation of observed patterns, and evaluation of government
policy.</p>

<title>Equilibrium Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Market Process</a></h1>
<h2>Equilibrium Analysis</h2>

<p>Neoclassical economists use a fundamentally different methodology.
"The economist must first ascertain and gather the facts which are
relevant to the consideration of a specific economic problem ...
The economist then puts this collection of facts in order and summarizes
them by 'distilling out' a principle"
(<a href="biblio.html#McConnell">McConnell</a>, p. 3). Economics, like
natural sciences, starts by gathering empirical data. "All sciences are
empirical. All sciences are based upon ... observable and verifiable
behavior of certain data" (<a href="biblio.html#McConnell">McConnell</a>,
p. 4). Theories make assumptions to simplify reality, and are verified
by comparing their predictions (conclusions) with empirical data.</p>

<p>Individual behavior is described by constrained maximization.
Consumers maximize utility given perfectly known means and ends.
In a similar manner, firms maximize profits faced with perfectly
known cost and revenue curves. Uncertainty can be introduced by
assigning probabilities to possible outcomes, but the range of
possible outcomes is known. (See, for example,
<a href="biblio.html#Pindyck">Pindyck and Rubinfeld</a>,
pp. 58-59,73,246-247.)</p>

<p>Neoclassical economists use several equilibrium models to describe
various "market structures." These generally include one of perfect
competition, one of pure monopoly, and others of imperfect competition.
All of the models have certain assumptions in common -- most importantly
the assumption of perfect information. They differ in other respects,
such as the number of buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>Market participants make plans, many of which anticipate other
participants' actions (for example, a plan to buy anticipates an
offer to sell). Equilibrium occurs when all participants are aware
of all market opportunities (so that their plans take full advantage
of all possibilities, and that their plans are compatible, that is,
can all be carried out.) Perfect knowledge of market data is not merely
a precondition of equilibrium, but its defining characteristic.</p>

<p>Neoclassical economists measure the efficiency of market structures
and government policies with producer and consumer surplus, benefits
received from the quantity of a good that is bought or sold. Producer
or consumer surplus within the market structure, or after the
imposition of a government policy, are compared with the surplus
within the 'perfectly competetive' market structure. (See, for example,
<a href="biblio.html#Pindyck">Pindyck and Rubinfeld</a>, pp. 289-325,
and <a href="biblio.html#McConnell">McConnell</a>, p. 546.)</p>

<p>The assumptions of the perfect competition model are generally
recognized to include product homogeneity, many buyers and sellers
with no effect on price, free entry into and exit from the industry,
and perfect knowledge of relevant data on behalf of all market
participants. Any deviation from these assumptions, such as product
differentiation, leads to a market structure of imperfect competition.
Perfectly competitive firms face horizontal demand curves and
receive zero economic profit. (See, for example,
<a href="biblio.html#Pindyck">Pindyck and Rubinfeld</a>, pp. 246,270,
and <a href="biblio.html#McConnell">McConnell</a>, p. 545.)</p>

<p>Imperfectly or monopolistically competitive market structures assume
highly substitutable but differentiated products and relatively
easy entry and exit (as well as perfect knowledge). Firms face
downward-sloping demand curves and have some monopoly power. Firms
are able to achieve this deviation from perfect competition through
competition: "Combination, conspiracy and cutthroat competition are
all means of reducing competition"
(<a href="biblio.html#McConnell">McConnell</a>, p. 81). Advertising
also reduces competition, changing demand rather than the product.
"Advertising expenditures as such are relatively unproductive,
they add little or nothing to the well-being of society"
(<a href="biblio.html#McConnell">McConnell</a>, p. 605).</p>

<p>The market structure of pure monopoly assumes a single seller of
a product with no close substitutes and restricted entry. Monopolies
face downward-sloping demand, set price above and output below that
of perfect competition, leading to losses for society. Barriers to
entry include economies of scale, patents, monopolized resource
ownership, and unfair competition.</p>

<title>Criticism of Equilibrium Analysis</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Market Process</a></h1>
<h2>Austrian Criticism of Equilibrium Analysis</h2>

<p>As might be expected, Austrians reject the mathematical equilibrium
approach of neoclassical economics. The assumptions of the equilibrium
models are intended to simplify rather than represent reality.
Neoclassical economists claim that their models' predictions rather
than assumptions are the point at which the models are empirically
verifiable. The restrictive assumptions of equilibrium models, Austrians
claim, lead to incorrect interpretations of events that lie outside
those assumptions.</p>

<p>The source of Austrian disagreement with equilibrium models is
the methodology of neoclassical economists. Neoclassical economists
believe that economics, and indeed "all sciences," are empirical
and dependent upon observation. Austrians point out the
existence of purely logical sciences, including all of mathematics,
whose conclusions (theories) are inherently valid given that their
assumptions are valid. The statement that "2 + 2 = 4" is true
whether two of anything are observed in the real world or not.</p>

<p>Austrians argue that economics is also a logical, not empirical,
science. Economic data cannot be observed, because they are not
present in the external world, but solely in the minds of acting
individuals. Logic is valid for economics because and when the
assumptions of economics are valid. That is, if a theory assumes
that leisure is preferred to labor, then the theory is true only
when that assumption is true. (A theory is true <em>when</em> its
assumptions are true, even though its assumptions may not be
directly observable.)</p>

<p>Economists cannot begin by collecting facts, and then constructing
theories, because economic facts can only be collected if a theory
of what is relevant is first made. Empirical observation can
stimulate economists' interest in particular areas, or cause
economists to re-evaluate their assumptions and logic, but can
never lead to or verify a theory.</p>

<p>Austrians also disagree with the neoclassical interpretation of
individual behavior as maximization. Maximizing assumes that
consumers apply known means to known ends, and that firms face
known cost and revenue curves. In this situation of perfect knowledge,
the optimal course of action is implied by the data.</p>

<p>Austrian such as Ludwig von Mises, however, use a broader view
of human behavior. The maximizing individual is a mere calculator.
"Mises' <i>homo agens</i>, on the other hand, is endowed not only
with the propensity to pursue goals efficiently, once ends and means
are clearly identified, but also with the drive and alertness needed
to identify which ends to strive for and which means are available"
(<a href="biblio.html#Kirzner">Kirzner</a>, p. 34). Any theory that
assumes maximizing behavior cannot accurately assess behavior intended
to actively search for and learn new data.</p>

<p>The Austrian criticism of maximization points to the fundamental
criticism Austrians have of equilibrium analysis. Austrians believe
assumptions should correspond to, not simplify, reality, and the
assumption of equilibrium models that most violates this principle
is the assumption of perfect knowledge. With imperfect knowledge,
individuals must be alert to opportunities available on the market,
including related information such as prices, qualities, costs and
revenues. Austrians believe that such data "cannot properly be
regarded as given facts but ought to be regarded as problems to
be solved by the process of competition" (<a
href="biblio.html#Hayek">Hayek</a>, p. 96). Theories that assume
perfect information cannot correctly interpret activities that aim
at gaining or spreading knowledge.</p>

<p>Some economists have tried to incorporate imperfect knowledge
into equilibrium models, a logically inconsistent approach. For
example, treating information as a good within an equilibrium
framework must assume that consumers have perfect knowledge about
the prices and quality of information, contradicting the hypothesis
of imperfect information.</p>

<p>Austrians criticiez other aspects of equilibrium analysis as well.
Neoclassical economists use output (in the form of consumer and
producer surplus) as a measure of efficiency and the model of
perfect competition as a standard. However, consumers also value
quality, which "offers compensations which, while not entering
any output index, yet contribute to what the output index is in
the last resort intended to measure" (<a
href="biblio.html#Schumpeter">Schumpeter</a>, p. 82). Also, a model
that makes assumptions that can never be met by reality should not
be used as a standard against which to compare reality. Only
possible situations should be compared to determine which best meets
a certain goal.</p>

<p>Austrians have further criticisms of specific equilibrium models.
Austrians argue that the model of perfect competition defines
competition misleadingly, that models of imperfect competition view
product differentiation and "selling costs" incorrectly, and
that the model of pure monopoly misinterprets the nature of
competition and its restriction.</p>

<p>In ordinary usage, 'competition' means a rivalrous process of
trying to outdo one's competitors. But to neoclassical economists,
'perfect competition' is</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>the situation in which every market participant does
	exactly what everyone else is doing, in which it is
	utterly pointless to try to achieve something in any
	way better than what is already being done by others,
	and in which, in fact, it is not necessary to keep
	one's eyes open to what the others are doing at all.
	(<a href="biblio.html#Kirzner">Kirzner</a>, p. 90)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only relation the neoclassical concept of competition has
with the concept of competition as a process is that perfect
competition could possibly be seen as the result of the
competitive process.</p>

<p>Some economists have incorrectly criticized the perfect
competition model as not being able to account for innovation.
In truth, innovation is incompatible with equilibrium models
in general. Equilibrium models assume perfect information of
all possible products and production methods, so that there is
no scope for innovation. If the possibility of innovation exists,
the market is not in equilibrium.</p>

<p>Models of imperfect competition claim that product differentiation
leads to monopoly power. Austrians believe that the grouping of
products as the same good is basically an arbitrary classification.
Reality is at least as close to the opposite situation, in which no
product is exactly like another, and products form a range of
substitutes. Product differentiation may result from the nature of
a particular good (such as most personal services) and have nothing
to do with the presence or absence of competition. Or product differences
may exist, as price differences may exist, at one time because
equilibrium has not been reached.</p>

<p>The disparity between the neoclassical and ordinary definitions
of competition leads to such paradoxical statements as "cutthroat"
or "unfair" competition indicates an absence (or imperfection) of
competition. In fact, all activities normally associated with
competing economically, including cutting prices, improving quality,
or trying to make consumers aware of a specific product, are considered
by neoclassical economists to move markets away from 'perfect'
competition. This confusion is primarily the result of the
assumption of perfect information.</p>

<p>The assumption of perfect information leads neoclassical economists
to misinterpret "selling costs" such as advertising expenditures.
Selling costs are defined as costs designed to change consumer demand,
and are distinguished from production costs which are designed to
change the product (supply). Such a distinction requires a normative
judgment on the part of the economist that a product has or has not
"objectively" changed after some expenditure.</p>

<p>Some economists have misguidedly defended advertising as a means of
spreading information. This allows orthodox economists to respond
that "the basic objective of advertising is to persuade, not to inform"
(<a href="biblio.html#McConnell">McConnell</a>, p. 605). In actuality,
the role of advertising is to alert the consumer to the availibility
and desirability of a product. With perfect information, such a role
would indeed be unnecessary and unproductive. In reality, consumers
do not have knowledge of all means available to them or of all ends
they might find worthwhile. Advertising does not need to convey
knowledge about goods as much as about the availability and desirability
of goods.</p>

<p>The claim that advertising does not add to society's well-being
also ignores the fact that consumers value advertising, as evidenced
by the purchase of catalogs and cable-television "shopping channels."</p>

<p>The model of pure monopoly suffers from the same inadequate notion
of competition as the other equilibrium models. Because competition
is viewed as a situation, rather than a process, monopoly (the
supposed complete absence of competition) can exist even when
competitive activities exist. Monopoly is defined as a single seller,
who is faced with downward-sloping demand, and thus produces results
different from (and worse than) perfect competition.</p>

<p>In reality, a seller with no legal protection or monopolized access
to resources is still under competitive pressure to make the
best opportunities available to consumers. The neoclassical definition
of competition again leads to a paradox, that the absence of competition
("pure monopoly") can be sustained by competition ("unfair" competition
such as "aggressive" price cutting).</p>

<p>All in all, Austrians criticize equilibrium analysis, not because
it is incorrect, but because it is irrelevant. Theories that make
assumptions that can never be met in reality are useful only as
a mental tool. Such theories can help economists isolate the
effects of a given condition, such as imperfect knowledge, by showing
what would happen if the condition were not present. They can help
economists learn complex processes by focusing on one part at a
time. But they cannot explain reality, and they cannot be used to
judge reality.</p>

<title>Market Process Theory</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Market Process</a></h1>
<h2>The Theory of Market Process</h2>

<p>As an alternative to equilibrium, Austrians offer the model of
market process. Individuals, within the institutions of a market
economy, trade and otherwise cooperate to achieve their own chosen
goals. Through trading, individuals learn new information, causing
them to revise their plans. The market process is this "series of
systematic changes in the interconnected network of market
decisions" (<a href="biblio.html#Kirzner">Kirzner</a>, p. 10).</p>

<p>The theory of the market process makes assumptions that, in
the Austrian view, delineate the situations in which the theory
is valid. The underlying assumption of all Austrian theories is
that humans choose. Market theory also assumes the existence of
markets, that is, an institutional framework of private property
and contracts where force and fraud are absent. Market theory assumes
that knowledge is imperfect. Specific areas of market theory may
use other assumptions, such as the existence of money or of
production.</p>

<p>The assumption of human choice allows for many economic concepts
to be defined. For example, choice always involves alternatives;
one alternative is defined as having greater value than another if
the individual would choose that alternative over the other. Value
is thus always relative, never objective. An end is the result
sought by an action; a means is anything used to achieve an end;
a good is anything desired by an individual. Many other useful
definitions and laws can be derived solely from the assumption of
choice.</p>

<p>Market process theory assumes that there is no force and fraud.
Force includes force by individuals in the form of theft and so forth,
and force by the government in the form of taxation, regulation,
and so forth. Austrians recognize that force by both individuals
and governments exists, and that market theory does not completely
explain reality. Instead, market theory allow economists to understand
the processes at work in a market society and to isolate the effects
of force. Attempts to analyze real-world markets must account for
government and individual force. Austrian analysis of government policies
thus includes not only the direct effects of the policies, but also
the effect of the policy on the functioning of the market process.</p>

<p>Austrian market theory assumes imperfect knowledge. Individual
market participants have limited knowledge of resources, products,
technology, prices and other participants' actions. A related
assumption is that individuals can learn, that they are alert to
the possibility of new information.</p>

<p>Specific aspects of market theory may require other assumptions.
Theories dealing with production, for instance, assume that resources
can be combined into products. The assumption of production allows
other definitions to be used, for example, those of consumer, producer
and resource owner. As another example, many theories deal with prices
and so assume the use of money.</p>

<p>The objective of market process theory must be to help economists
understand market processes that actually exist. Market theory must
explain how widely diffuse knowledge is coordinated and put to use,
how market participation helps individuals achieve their own goals,
how prices are determined, and how resources are allocated.</p>

<p>The problem that cooperation (including markets) is intended to
solve is how to best achieve goals. The knowledge necessary for
the solution of this problem includes scientific knowledge of
production processes and so forth, but also includes local knowledge,
"knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place"
(<a href="biblio.html#Hayek">Hayek</a>, p. 80). This knowledge is
not concentrated in one mind, and truly cannot be, because such
local knowledge changes faster than any one human mind can gather it.
Instead, this knowledge is spread out among many individuals. Part of
the problem is how to communicate the necessary knowledge to different
people, and how to encourage those that have the knowledge to use it.</p>

<p>Prices convey information about resources to market participants.
Buyers and sellers each have knowledge of affairs within their
limited horizons, but to make the best use of their resources they must
also have information from other areas. Prices convey the minimum
information they need: how scarce each resource is relative to other
resources, and changes in this relative scarcity. "Prices can act
to co-ordinate the separate actions of different people in the
same way as subjective values help the individual to co-ordinate the
parts of his own plan" (<a href="biblio.html#Hayek">Hayek</a>, p. 85).</p>

<P>With imperfect knowledge, opportunities for beneficial exchange will
go unexploited. A good (or bundle of inputs) can be bought at a lower
price than at which it (or its product) can be sold. These opportunities
exist because sellers are unaware that they can receive a higher price
and because buyers are unaware that there are sellers who will accept
a lower price. Such price differences are opportunities for arbitrage
profit.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurship in the Austrian model is alertness to such
opportunities. When a resource becomes more scarce in one area, it is
the entrepreneur who notices and responds to the price differences
between that area and other areas, in the process affecting prices
so that they convey the correct information. It is the entrepreneur
who utilizes knowledge of new products and new production methods.</p>

<p>Profits provide the incentive for people to use the knowledge they
have. If an individual has knowledge of how to produce a new good,
or of a less costly way to produce an existing good, he can achieve
benefits for himself by utilizing this knowledge. A person will use
his knowledge if he believes it will make him better off (allow
him to achieve more of his goals).</p>

<p>Profits greater than 'normal,' then, can serve to improve the
quality or quantity of goods. This conclusion is the opposite of
that of equilibrium models, that profits are a sign of inefficiency.
The difference in conclusions results from equilibrium models'
assumption of perfect knowledge, whereas in the Austrian model (as
in reality) knowledge is spread among many individuals, who must
be convinced to use it.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurial profit is the difference between the price the
entrepreneur pays for the good (or input bundle) and the price
he receives for it (or its product). Entrepreneurship is not a factor
of production; the input bundle contains everything needed for
production. What the entrepreneur does is decide to commit those
inputs to the production of one good rather than another.</p>

<p>There is a fundamental difference between the entrepreneur and
the resource owner. A resource owner who sells or rents his resource
receives profit as the difference between what he gives up and
what he receives, but the entrepreneur gives up nothing. A resource
owner has sole control over the supply of the resource, but the
opportunities noticed by the entrepreneur can be noticed (and
exploited) by anyone with similar alertness.</p>

<p>Offers to buy and sell are available in the market. Each market
participant (buyer or seller) accepts the offer he feels is the
best available to him, and at the same time recognizes that others
will accept his offer only if they believe it is the best available
to them. Each participant therefore must try to make his offer the
best available.</p>

<p>Competition in the Austrian model is this attempt to make an offer
the best available. Competition is inherently entrepreneurial because
it requires that competitors be alert to other offers available.
Entrepreneurship is inherently competitive because no resources are
needed to notice profit opportunities.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs, through competition with each other, eliminate
profit opportunities. When an opportunity is noticed, an
entrepreneur makes an offer just enough to outdo current offers.
Competing entrepreneurs strive to outdo each other until there
is no more opportunity for profit.</p>

<p>The entrepreneur, then, is the driving force of the market process,
allocating resources to the production of goods most desired by
consumers. When consumer values change, or resources become more
or less scarce, entrepreneurs notice and eliminate the resulting
profit opportunity.</p>

<p>The market process, the co-ordinated adjustment of economic plans,
is inherently competitive. Any restriction of competition restricts
the adjustment process. However, many actions that neoclassical economists
consider to be restrictions of competition Austrians consider to be
competition. Cutting prices, building excess capacity, improving
quality, and advertising are all ways to make one seller's offer better
than others' offers. Such actions could have equally been taken by the
seller's competitors, who either did not notice the opportunity or
felt it was not worthwhile.</p>

<p>The only possible restrictions on competition possible in the
Austrian view are monopolized access to some resource or the use of
force to prevent others from making better offers available. If a
resource necessary for production is not available to potential
competitors, a producer limits the ability of others to make
better offers to consumers.</p>

<p>Monopoly in the Austrian view is monopoly over the use of a
resource, not over the production of a good. Production can not
be monopolized except by the use of force. If force is absent
and resources are equally available to all, a producer who happens
to be the only seller of a particular product is still under
competitive pressure to make the best offer available to buyers.
If the single seller raises prices such that profit opportunities
are created, entrepreneurs will notice and exploit the opportunities.</p>

<p>Monopoly can have several sources. Monopoly can result from economic
institutions; for example, property rights convey a monopoly over the
property. Monopoly can also result from entrepreneurial effort; an
entrepreneur may competitively buy the complete stock of a resource.
The profits and disadvantages are attributed to the institutions in
the first case, and to entrepreneurship in the second case.</p>

<p>Austrians analyze markets using these basic concepts of competition,
entrepreneurship, market process and prices. Different institutional
arrangements and government policies are compared by examining their
effects on the market process.</p>

<title>Market Process: Conclusion </title>
</head>

<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">Market Process</a></h1>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Austrian theory of the market explains how knowledge is
communicated to different individuals, how innovation is encouraged,
how entrepreneurs satisfy consumer demand, and how change arises
from within the market. The neoclassical equilibrium models of
market structure cannot explain these phenomena. By assuming that
market participants have perfect knowledge of market data, and by
using output as the sole measure of efficiency, equilibrium models
misinterpret communicating and innovating behavior.</p>

<p>The market is an evolutionary process, and not a static equilibrium.
Change is inherent in the market, because people learn from their
participation in the market. This change tends to allocate resources
to the uses most desired by consumers. Entrepreneurs are the agents
of this change. Competition is a rivalrous process of trying to do
better than one's competitors, not a static situation in which
everyone does the same as everyone else.</p>

<title>Human Action</title>
<!-- Place: universal -->

<h1>Ludwig von Mises' <cite>Human Action</cite></h1>

<p>These are my notes on <a href="/revolution/by_name/M/LudwigvonMises.html">
Ludwig von Mises'</a> <cite>Human Action</cite> taken as part of an economics
project in college. These are by no means scholarly, just a way for me to
enhance my understanding of the book's theories.</p>

<h2>Notes on Part I (pp. 1 - 142)</h2>

<h3>The Sciences</h3>

<p>The natural sciences are the experimental sciences: biology, chemistry,
physics etc. They depend on observation and constant relations (repeatability
of experiments) for gaining knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Praxeology</i> is the study of human action, and includes economics and
history. Economics is the study of what is universal about action, history is
the study of what is specific.</p>

<p>History in itself is objective. The history of a subject is the study of all
facts, actions etc. that are relevant to the subject. The historian must use
his understanding to determine which facts are relevant to his subject, and so
introduces his subjective beliefs and errors.</p>

<p>Praxeology studies human action as a given, without regard to its causes or
motives, which are studied by psychology. Praxeology studies only purposeful
(chosen) action. Medicine and physiology study involuntary action.</p>

<p>Epistemology is the basis of all other sciences. It is the study of
knowledge itself, of what we are capable of knowing, of the validity of our
knowledge.</p>

<h3>Epistemology</h3>

<p>There are two sources of knowledge: observation (experimental knowledge) and
logic (<i>aprioristic</i> knowledge).</p>

<p>Experimental science is based on the assumption of constant relations; when
the same conditions occur, the same results occur. Experimental knowledge is
valid if it accurately describes events in the natural realm.</p>

<p>Aprioristic knowledge is inherently true for its assumptions. For example,
the laws of geometry are implied in the basic axioms of geometry. Aprioristic
knowledge is valid if its reasoning from premises to conclusions is logically
correct. Aprioristic theories cannot be validated or invalidated by experience.
For example, the Pythagorean theorem cannot be proved or disproved by measuring
real-life triangles; it is inherently true for its assumptions.</p>

<p>Many theories attack economics at the point of epistemology. Historicism
claims that only experience is valid (that logic is invalid). Irrationalism
claims that the human mind is incapable of any knowledge of the world, which is
irrational. Polylogism (including racism and multiculturalism) claims that
different group of humans have different types of logic, and that knowledge
valid for one group is invalid for others. Positivism, panphysicalism and
behaviorism also attack the validity of logic.</p>

<p>The attacks on the validity of logic are insufficient. The critics of logic
never point out just what logical relation is valid for the bourgeois but not
the proletariat, or for the Jew and not the Aryan. They cannot explain
disagreement among members of the same class, and they do not hesitate to make
use of the scientific discoveries of other classes.</p>

<h3>Methodology of Economics</h3>

<p>Humans experience two worlds, the external world of natural phenomenon and
the internal world of thought, feeling and value. Human action deals with both,
causing change in the natural world in response to chosen goals. Economists
must assume a <i>methodological dualism</i>, describing economics in terms of
subjective intentions. Change has two causes: <i>causality</i> is the laws of
nature, <i>teleology</i> is purposeful action.</p>

<p>Human action does not exhibit constant relations. Different people placed in
the same situation, or the same person placed in the same situation twice,
behave differently. They choose how to act. Therefore economists must assume a
<i>methodological apriorism</i>, the gaining of knowledge by deductive
reasoning from first principles, and not experimental methods. Experience can
neither prove nor disprove any economic theory, but only direct economists'
curiosity towards certain topics.</p>

<p>Human action, the underlying assumption of all economic conclusions, is an
external fact, not a creation of the human mind (as other aprioristic knowledge
is). Therefore the conclusions of economics accurately describe reality when
logically derived from human action and when its other assumptions are present
in reality.</p>

<p>All purposeful action is performed by individuals, even when the individuals
are acting on behalf of a group, and even when the individual's existence
depends on the existence of a group. Therefore economists must assume a
<i>methodological individualism</i>, tracing all economic events back to the
actions of individuals.</p>

<p>Economics is the study of human action, and must be concerned with actual,
concrete action. Economists must adopt a <i>methodological singularism</i>,
studying what is necessary and universal about actual actions performed by
actual human beings.</p>

<h3>Purposeful Action</h3>

<p><i>Human action</i> is purposeful behavior, action taken to achieve a goal
desired by the individual. Humans choose; it makes no difference to today's
economist whether they in some metaphysical sense "really" choose or whether
they are propelled to choose by some other cause, "destiny" or the arrangement
of molecules in their brains. With today's knowledge, human action cannot be
reduced, that is, broken down into further causes. It is an <i>ultimate
given</i> -- something which can not be further analyzed by contemporary
science.</p>

<p>All action is necessarily rational from the point of view of economics,
since it cannot be further analyzed than to accept it as a given. The opposite
of action is not irrational action but involuntary action, the response of the
human body to stimuli.</p>

<p>Humans act because they believe their action will result in a state of
affairs more desirable to them. Humans act purposefully to achieve chosen goals
- this is all economists mean by saying that humans act "in their
self-interst," or "to increase their happiness," or "to maximize their
utility." Economics is not concerned only with the "economic side" of life, or
only with "the profit motive," or only with material things. Economics is the
study of all that men aim at and the means they use to achieve their aims.</p>

<p>The <i>end</i>, <i>goal</i> or <i>aim</i> of an action is the result sought
by it. The end of every action can be said to be the removal of a felt
uneasiness, that is, the exchange of a better state of affairs for the current
state. One end may be a step towards another end, in which case it can be
called an "intermediate" end.</p>

<p>A <i>means</i> is what an acting individual uses to attain his end. A thing
has no identity as a means, or as any other economic concept, except when an
individual considers it such.</p>

<p>A <i>good</i> is any means or end, anything an individual desires. Goods may
be material or nonmaterial (services). Goods may be arbitrarily classed
according to whether they satisfy human wants directly or indirectly. A
<i>consumer good</i> or <i>good of the first order</i> is one that satisfies in
itself. A <i>producer good</i> or <i>good of a higher order</i> is one that
must be combined with other goods to produce a consumer good. This
classification is only a mental tool.</p>

<p><i>Value</i> or <i>utility</i> is the perceived usefulness of a good for the
attainment of an end. Economic value is subjective, existing solely within the
mind of the acting individual, and differs from technological utility, the
objective capability of an object to produce an effect. Value is an ordering, a
ranking of alternatives. Thus man may be considered to have a <i>scale of
value</i>, ranking every possible choice ordinally. This scale is a mental tool
with no existence outside of concrete actions.</p>

<p>Value is attached only to <i>economic</i> or <i>scarce</i> goods, those
which have limited effects and availability. That is, value is attached only to
alternatives, mutually exclusive choices. <i>Free goods</i> are those which
produce unlimited effects at no cost. For example, a known recipe can be used
repeatedly without losing any effect.</p>

<p>The "paradox of value" seen by early economists was a fallacious viewpoint.
They could not explain why gold was more valuable than iron, when iron was more
useful. In reality, man does not choose between "gold" and "iron," but between
definite quantities of gold and iron at a definite time and place. He chooses
the quantity that best furthers his aims.</p>

<p>Value (utility) cannot be measured, calculated or even communicated. The
value of one quantity of a good need not depend on the value of other
quantities of the same good. The value of seven cows need not be seven times
the value of one cow. Thus the concepts of "total value" and "total utility"
are meaningless when the individual is not faced with a choice involving the
complete stock of a good.</p>

<p><i>Marginal value</i> or <i>marginal utility</i> is the smallest value
derived from one unit of a supply of a homogeneous good. A unit in this case is
the smallesy quantity usable for a purpose. The <i>law of marginal utility</i>
states that the utility of one unit of a supply is the marginal value of the
supply, since if an individual is to give up a unit, he will give up the one
that renders him the least utility. Similarly, any additional unit will be less
valuable than the least valuable existing unit, since if an existing unit could
be applied to a more valuable use it would.</p>

<p>The <i>law of returns</i>, popularly called the law of diminishing returns,
states that for the combination of producer goods there exists an optimum.
Holding the quantity of one of the goods constant, there is a quantity of the
other good which will yield the highest value per unit of the constant good.
This law is implied in the fact that goods produce limited effects. It does not
apply to free goods, only economic goods.</p>

<p>There is no need for a distinction in economics between needs and wants. Men
choose their ends; what those ends "should" be are irrelevant to the study of
the world as it is.</p>

<p>The <i>price</i> of any action (which is an exchange of states) is that
which is abandoned. <i>Cost</i> is the value of the price paid to the
individual paying it. The <i>gain</i>, <i>profit</i>, <i>loss</i> or <i>net
yield</i> of an action is the difference between the costs of an action and the
value of the state attained to the acting individual.</p>

<p><i>Labor</i> is the use of the "manifestations of human life" as a means.
Labor is economized because it is scarce (produces limited effects), but also
because leisure (refraining from labor) is a good. The disutility of labor (the
value of leisure) is an observed feature of human life; it is not implied in
the category of human action. The use of the human faculties is labor if it is
a means to an end, and simply life and leisure otherwise.</p>

<p>Labor is relatively nonspecific; it can be applied to a wider range of uses
than most natural resources. Labor is required for every act of production.
Becauser of these facts, labor is the most scarce of all producer goods.</p>

<p>Complementary producer goods can be utilized only to the extent allowed by
the most scarce of them. Technological advancement cannot make any labor
useless as long as there are other ways to increase human well-being.</p>

<p><i>Production</i> is the use of human reason to direct (transform, not
create) resources for the attainment of human ends. There is no fundamental
difference between producing material goods and producing services, or between
using labor and using other factors of production.</p>

<h3>Time</h3>

<p>Action implies time, the sequence of events. The <i>present</i> is a span of
time during which a given set of alternatives are still available to an acting
individual.</p>

<p>Time, being scarce to mortal and aging humans, must be economized as any
other scarce resource, but is unique in that it is irreversible. Time applied
for one purpose cannot be reallocated for another purpose, and two actions of
an individual can never be synchronous.</p>

<p>Humans choose, and their values may change, with every action. Therefore
sequential actions of an individual may not be compared to determine if they
are "consistent" or "rational."</p>

<h3>Uncertainty</h3>

<p>Action implies uncertainty. If the future were known, humans could not
choose; their actions would be predetermined.</p>

<p>A statement is <i>probable</i> if some knowledge about it is known but not
enough to determine exactly its truth. With <i>class probability</i>, we know
nothing about a singular event except that it is a member of a larger class
that we know exactly. This involves repeatable instances of natural phenomena,
the rolling of dice, the survival rate of disease. With <i>case
probability</i>, we know some but not all the factors determining the outcome
of a singular event. This includes nonrepeatable events involving human action.
Past outcomes of similar events have no direct bearing on a unique event.</p>

<p><i>Betting</i> is risking something against another person on the results of
a unique event. <i>Gambling</i> is risking something against another person on
the result of an event that is a member of a class.</p>

<p>Case probability is not open to numerical evaluation. The correctly reasoned
conclusions of economics are certain and true, and so can predict the outcome
of action. However, economics cannot numerically predict outcomes because there
are no constant relations in the field of human action.</p>

<h2>Notes on Part II (pp. 143 - 199)</h2>

<h3>Society</h3>

<p><i>Society</i> is the concerted action, or cooperation, of individuals. Only
individuals act; only individuals have interests (ends, goals, aims). Society
does not have interests because it does not act.</p>

<p>Holistic theories of society (collectivism) view society as an entity
separate from the individuals acting in it. In this view, society acts
independently of individuals, and thus individual interests may conflict with
society's interests. Society must therefore be forced upon individuals, who are
unwilling and would not cooperate in the absence of force.</p>

<p>Individualism maintains that individuals make up society entirely.
Indivuduals cooperate with others because this cooperation allows them to
achieve their own desires better than solitary action.</p>

<p>Varieties of collectivism differ on what constitutes society's interests.
The justification of their view of society's interests relies on transcendental
beliefs, and thus they cannot convince men by reason alone. They rely on faith
for believers and violent suppression of nonbelievers. Collectivism thus
inevitably leads to warfare and antagonism, the opposite of societal
relations.</p>

<h3>Liberalism</h3>

<p><i>Liberalism</i> (now called classical liberalism or libertarianism) is a
political doctrine, not a praxeological or economic study. It is an application
of economic theory, and has definite values and judgments. It assumes that
people prefer abundance to poverty, and tries to teach man how to live in
accordance with such values. It is not materialistic in the sense of putting
material values above others, but merely states that men prefer material
abundance to material security.</p>

<p>Liberalism favors democracy to allow for the peaceful transition of
government, in the belief that a man is better fit to rule if he can persuade
voters than if he can successfully fight the current government militarily.
Liberalism does not believe in the infallibility of majorities, and supports
consitutions that safeguard peace and avoid violent conflict.</p>

<p>Liberalism relies on rational economics, and not on transcendent, mystical
or superhuman phenomenon. It is not antireligious or antitheistic, but neutral
with regard to religious beliefs that do not disturb the peace required for the
conduct of social and economic affairs. Liberalism is opposed to theocracy,
states which claim supernatural legitimacy for their laws.</p>

<p>Liberalism "maintains that it is possible to convince the immense majority
that peaceful cooperation within the framework of society better serves their
rightly understood interests than mutual battling and social
disintegration."</p>

<h3>Division of Labor</h3>

<p>Individuals cooperate in society because "work performed under the division
of labor is more productive than isolated work" and because "man's reason is
capable of recognizing this truth."</p>

<p>Division of labor is more productive than isolated labor because men are
unequal in their ability to perform various kinds of labor, because the
nonhuman factors of production are unequally distributed about the earth, and
because there are undertakings which exceed the capacity of one man.</p>

<p>The <i>law of association</i>, developed by Ricardo and commonly called the
law of comparative advantage when applied to international trade, demonstrates
the preferability of division of labor to all participants, even when one
participant is more productive in every respect than another.</p>

<p>The Ricardian law of association assumes two countries producing two goods,
where the goods are mobile but labor and capital (factors of production) are
not. Under these conditions, both countries will benefit if the more efficient
area produces the commodity for which its superiority is greatest. To
generalize the law of association requires economic calculation, that is,
market prices.</p>

<p>The division of labor enhances natural differentiation, as different
geographic areas take on different tasks. It enchances the inequality of men,
as men develop some abilities and ignore others. It splits production of good
into discrete steps, which allows for mechanization and production.</p>

<h3>World View and Ideology</h3>

<p>Action requires thinking. To act man must have an idea (theory) of a causal
relation, that is, that his action will produce a desired effect.</p>

<p>A <i>world view</i> is all theories guiding an individual's actions, taken
as a comprehensive system of knowledge. A world view is an interpretation of
all things and an opinion concerning the best means for removing uneasiness as
much as possible.</p>

<p>An <i>ideology</i> is a subset of a world view, all theories of an
individual concerning individual conduct and social relations.</p>

<p><i>Asceticism</i> as a world view and ideology recommends complete
withdrawal from material concerns. However, complete ascetics would die fairly
quickly, so even most ascetics hav some concern for material well-being, such
as nourishment.</p>

<p>For everyone but complete ascetics, the higher productivity of division of
labor makes society the foremost means of attaining ends. Since most ideologies
have a common end, material abundance, ideological disputes are mainly over
means.</p>

<p>Popular ideologies are usually logically inconsistent, eclectic mixtures of
ideas. Logically fallacious ideologies cannot "work" but instead merely obscure
the true causes of problems and delay their resolution. One of the tasks of
praxeology is to substitute correct ideologies for contradictory
eclecticism.</p>

<p>Society is the product of ideologies, because every action that makes up
society assumes an ideology (a belief that the action will produce a
result.)</p>

<h3>Might</h3>

<p><i>Government</i>, the state, is the monopoly of violence in society. It
maintains peace so that people can cooperate and enjoy the benefits of
cooperation. In order for a government to survive, the mass of its citizens
must feel that to be loyal to it better serves their own interests than
overthrowing it.</p>

<p>Not all interhuman relations are societal relations. Human actions directed
at mutual detriment are not social. Only actions directed at peaceful
cooperation are social relations.</p>

<p>Some theorists attack society as an unnatural rejection of animal instincts
towards aggression, or as anti-evolutionary because it allows the physically
weak to survive. However, reason is as part of man's nature as instinct, and
evolution tends merely towards survival. Man survives better in society. Man
chooses, and must choose between the satisfaction of the lust for violence and
the benefits brought about by peaceful cooperation.</p>

<p><i>Might</i> is the power or ability to direct action. <i>Rule</i> is the
exercise of might in the political body.</p>

<p>Might is derived from ideology, beause people must accept and ideology to
obey the directions of the mighty. Even if the directions are imposed by force,
those who do the imposing must accept the ideology.</p>

<p>"A durable system of government must rest upon an ideology acknowledged by
the majority."</p>

<h3>Progress</h3>

<p>Without reference to actions and goals, progress and retrogression have no
meaning. Change does not imply improvement, and evolution does not imply
evolution to a higher form of life. Change and evolution merely signify the
process which led from one point in time to a later one.</p>

<p>Progress towards social perfection is not inevitable because man chooses and
because man is not infallible. Man may choose barbarism to society.</p>

<p>Progress can be a shorthand term for progress towards the common goals of
the immense majority of men, especially the preference of material abundance to
material scarcity.</p>

<h3>Exchange</h3>

<p>Action is always an exchange of states. If an action is performed by an
individual without any reference to cooperation with other individuals, it is
<i>autistic exchange</i>, otherwise it is <i>interpersonal exchange</i>.</p>

<p>Autistics exchange may be beneficial or harmful to other individuals, or
have no effect on them. Aggression is autistic action.</p>

<h3>Cooperation</h3>

<p>If social cooperation is voluntary exchange, it is <i>contractual</i>; if it
is based on command and subordination, it is <i>hegemonic</i>. With contractual
bonds, all parties choose and act. With hegemonic bonds, only the director
chooses and acts; subordinates choose only whether to be subordinates.</p>

<p>Social cooperation whether contractual or hegemonic is an order of peace and
peaceful settlement of disputes. As far as there are violent conflicts, there
is not society.</p>

<p>Hegemonic societies must either forego the advantages of the division of
labor with societies that do not accept the hegemony, or attempt a worldwide
hegemony.</p>

<p>In contractual societies rights and law determine the scope of action. In
hegemonic societies the director determines all action. Hegemonic societies use
violence and threats of violence to affect the decisions of those who choose
not to obey.</p>

<h3>The Laws of Economics</h3>

<p>The categories of praxeology are universally valid because they reflect the
structure of the human mind and the natural world. Conclusions derived solely
from the axioms of economics are also universally valid. However, some economic
laws assume certain conditions, and are valid solely for those conditions. For
example, the economics of the free market depend on the existence of a free
market.</p>

<title>Hayek's Individualism</title>

<h1>Notes on Hayek's <cite>Individualism and Economic Order</cite></h1>

<p>These are my notes on <a href="/revolution/by_name/H/FriedrichHayek.html">
Friedrich Hayek's</a> <cite>Individualism and Economic Order</cite> for an
economics project in college.</p>

<hr>

<p>Equilibrium refers to actions. "All propositions of equilibrium analysis,
such as the proposition that relative values will correspond to relative costs,
or tha a person will equalize the marginal returns of any one factor in its
different uses, are propositions about the relations between actions." (p. 36)
Thus equilibrium assumes a span of time "since the actions of one person must
take place successively in time." (p. 37)</p>

<p>Only actions can be in equilibrium, not a person or thing such as a market.
A single person's actions can be said to be in equilibrium as far as they are
part of a single plan. Such actions must be based on the same expectations
(expected values of the data). The data are as known by the acting individual,
not objective facts as the observing economist knows them.</p>

<p>For the actions of many individuals to be in equilibrium, all individuals
must have the same knowledge and expectations of the data (else their plans
will conflict and at least some will require changes), and the individuals'
plans must be compatible (that is, because one's actions are another's data,
each person's plans must be known and expected by others).</p>

<p>Change or constancy in data refers to the subjective knowledge of acting
individuals, not to objective change or constancy. For example, if the sun
stopped moving across the sky, objectively there is an absence of change but
there is obviously change in economic data requiring revision of plans.</p>

<p>The equivalence of every individual's subjective interpretation of the data
and the correspondence of this interpretation to objective reality (that is,
expectations proving correct) are not preconditions to equilibrium but its
defining characteristics.</p>

<p>Economists study equilibrium because they believe a tendency towards
equilibrium exists in reality. This can only mean that there exists a tendency
for the knowledge of different individuals to become both uniform and correct,
which is an empirically testable proposition. Study of equilibrium cannot
however determine the conditions necessary for this tendency or the process by
which it occurs.</p>

<p>Most economic anlaysis consists of tautological, logical deduction from
assumptions. The conclusions of such analysis are valid only when the
assumptions are present. The existence of the assumptions is the point at which
economics is verifiable. The analysis itself can be tested only for logical
consistency.</p>

<p>One of the conditions often considered necessary for the tendency towards
equilibrium is 'constancy of the data.' This can not mean that nothing that can
affect economic decisions ever changes objectively, which would imply that the
sun never moves and so forth. What is usually meant is that "there must be some
discernible regularity in the world which makes it possible to predict events
correctly." (p. 49)

<p>Individuals need not possess perfect knowledge of everything for their
actions to be in equilibrium. The only knowledge that must be correct is
knowledge which "will necessarily be confirmed or corrected in the course of
the execution of the plan." (p. 53) Knowledge may exist which would affect an
individual's plans, but be unknown to the individual, and still the
individual's plans can be compatible with everyone else's. Equilibrium in the
simplest view is not necessarily an optimum position.</p>

<p>Things defined by the social sciences "refer not to some objective
properties possessed by the things, but to views which some other person holds
about the things." Such definitions are independent of physical properties.
They can be defined only in reference to a person, a goal of the person, and a
thing the person believes to be a means to the end. Money can not be defined in
terms of shape or substance, but only in terms of the beliefs of some person or
people.</p>

<p>Facts of the social sciences are either such definitions or human action
itself. Actions are grouped together as the same thing not because of their
physical properties but because of the actors' intentions.</p>

<p>Such definitions imply attitudes or intentions on the part of people, and
can be understood by the scientist only "on the analogy of our own mind." (p.
63) The action is what it is, and not simply physical motion, because we
believe the actor has a specific intention. Because action can be known only
through analogy with our own mind, our mind can construct through pure logical
deduction "an (at least in principle) <em>exhaustive</em> classification of all
the possible forms of intelligible behavior." (p. 68) Economics does not
explain action (the realm of psychology) but classifies and orders it.</p>

<p>Economic actions are "all acts of choice which are made necessary by the
scarcity of means available for our ends." (p. 68)</p>

<p>Facts about social collectives can not be observed. A historical fact is not
a single entity, but a composite of many parts selected on the basis of a prior
understanding (theory) of what such a fact is. For example, the American
Revolution is not a single observable fact but a selection of specific actions,
places and times, all selected according to a theory of what constitutes a
revolution. The historian uses theory to determine the relevant parts of the
whole. Theories of social collectives are not about the collectives but
constitute them. They "provide schemes of structural relationships ... [that]
fit together into a meaningful whole the elements which he [the historian]
actually finds." (p. 72) Social theories therefore can "never be verified or
falsified by reference to facts. All that we can and must verify is the
presence of our assumptoins in the particular case." (p. 73)</p>

<p>The 'economic problem' is how to make the best use of available means.
"<em>If</em> we possess all the relevant information, <em>if</em> we can start
out from a given system of preferences, and <em>if</em> we command complete
knowledge of available means, the problem which remains is purely one of logic
... This, however, is emphatically <em>not</em> the economic problem which
society faces." (p. 77)</p>

<p>The knowledge necessary for the solution of the economic problem is never
concentrated in a single mind, and part of the problem is how to utilize
knowledge which is scattered among many individuals. Much of the knowledge
needed is not scientific knowledge but "knowledge of the particular
circumstances of time and place." (p. 80)</p>

<p>Each individual possesses some of this local knowledge, but needs knowledge
from other areas beyond his scope to make decisions. Prices convey the
necessary information -- how scare each means is relative to other means, and
changes in this relative scarcity. "Prices can act to co-ordinate the separate
actions of different people in the same way as subjective values help the
individual to co-ordinate the parts of his own plan." (p. 85)</p>

<p>The theory of perfect competition assumes conditions that true competition
brings about. The theory generally assumes the following conditions:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>A homogeneous commodity offered and demanded by a large number of
relatively small buyers and sellers, none of whom expects to exercise by his
action a perceptible influence on price.</li>
<li>Free entry into the market and absence of other restraints on the movement
of prices and resources.</li>
<li>Complete knowledge of the relevant factors on the part of all participants
in the market.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>(p. 95)</p>

<p>With the last assumption, producers "are assumed to know the lowest cost at
which the commodity can be produced." (p. 95) Producers are also assumed to
know consumer demand already. "These cannot properly be regarded as given facts
but ought to be regarded as problems to be solved by the process of
competition." (p. 96)</p>

<p>Some goods and especially services are inherently different from each other,
which in equilibrium models represents 'imperfect' competition. Product
differentiation can be the result of the nature of the good itself, and have
nothing to do with competition. Further, considering homogeneousness always
superior to differentiation implies that variety has no value.</p>

<p>The grouping of commodities into classes as the 'same' product is an
arbitrary construction. Reality is closer to the case in which no product is
exactly like another. In such a case competition would still "bring about a set
of prices at which each commodity sold jsut cheap enough to outbid its
potential close substitutes." (p. 100) Competition should not be compared to
some ideal but to "the situation as it would exist if competition were
prevented from operating." (p. 100)</p>

<p>Knowledge is diffused among individuals, and those who possess relevant
knowledge must be persuaded to do so. Profits provide the incentive and
competition the means to use knowledge.</p>

<p>In markets which approximate the conditions of 'perfect' competition (that
is, where product and production are standardized), competition is absent
because it is not needed. When the data changes, it is competition which
distributes the new knowledge and returns the market to its 'stable' state.
"Competition is more important the more complex or 'imperfect' are the
objective conditions in which it has to operate." (p. 103)</p>

<p>"There is no sense ... in discussing what somebody with perfect knowledge
would do if our task must be to make the best use of the knowledge the existing
people have." (p. 104)</p>

<p>Competition produces the best use of available resources when not restricted
by government. A government-enforced monopoly is inefficient not because price
is higher than cost but because costs are probably higher than necessary. A
monopoly based on efficiency is as beneficial as a more obviously competitive
market, because the market position can and will be taken away by firms with
knowledge of more efficient production.</p>

<p>An implicit assumption of all models of the market is the existence of a
legal framework. "That a functioning market presupposes not only prevention of
violence and fraud but the protection of certain rights, such as property, and
the enforcement of contracts, is always taken for granted." (p. 111)</p>

<title>Kirzner's Competition and Entrepreneurship</title>
<!-- Place: global -->
<!-- Time: eternal -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Notes on Kirzner's <cite>Competition and Entrepreneurship</cite></h1>

<p>These are my notes on <a href="/revolution/by_name/K/IsraelKirzner.html">
Israel Kirzner's</a> <cite>Competition and Entrepreneurship</cite> for an
economics project in college.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Market Process</h2>

<p>Market theory (also called price theory or microeconomic theory) tries to
explain relationships among observed market phenomena. Two alternative
approaches to market theory are the orthodox neoclassical theory (developed
mainly by Marshall, Robinson, Chamberlin and Walras) and the Austrian market
process theory (developed by <a
href="/revolution/by_name/M/LudwigvonMises.html">Mises</a>, <a
href="/revolution/by_name/H/FriedrichHayek.html">Hayek</a> and Kirzner).</p>

<p>The objective of orthodox theory is to determine market equilibrium,
generating numerical values for prices and quantities at which transactions are
made. Orthodox theory analyzes the effects of exogenous change and policies in
terms of their effects on equilibrium. Equilibrium is the "one set of planned
activities" that allows all planned transactions to be carried out. (p. 4)</p>

<p>The objective of market process theory is to "understand how the decisions
of individual participants in the market interact to generate the market forces
which compel <em>changes</em> in prices, in outputs and in methods of
production and the allocation of resources." (p. 6)</p>

<p>Market participants make decisions (plans), many of which anticipate other
participants' actions. With imperfect knowledge, at the end of a given period,
many individuals will find that their plans could not be carried out (too
optimistic) or were carried out but failed to take advantage of more beneficial
opportunities (too pessimistic). Through market participation, individuals see
others' actual decisions (often in the form of prices), gaining knowledge that
causes them to revise their plans. This market process ("series of systematic
changes in the interconnected network of market decisions" p. 10) occurs even
without change in the "data" or underlying conditions of trade.</p>

<p>With perfect knowledge, individual plans will be made so that none fail
(from being too optimistic or pessimistic). The market process ceases (no
adjustments occur), and equilibrium exists.</p>

<p>Opportunuties (offers) to buy and sell are available in the market. An
individual (buyer or seller) accepts the offer he believes is the best
available, and at the same time realizes that others will accept his offer only
if they believe it is the best available to them. The market process in
inherently competitive, as individuals try to make their offers better than
everyone else's. This competition forces individuals "to gravitate closer and
closer to the limits of their ability to participate gainfully in the market."
(p. 12)

<p>With perfect knowledge, everyone knows which offer is best, so that
competition ceases, and equilibrium exists.</p>

<p>With imperfect knowledge, profit opportunities exist in the market. All such
opportunities consist of price differentials; a good (or bundle of inputs) can
be bought at a lower price than it (or its product) can be sold.
Entrepreneurship is alertness to unnoticed price opportunities. Entrepreneurs
exploit these opportunities, and through competition with each other, eliminate
them. The market process is inherently entrepreneurial because individuals
learn from their participation in the market.</p>

<p>With perfect knowledge, there is no scope for competition or
entrepreneurship. The theory of perfect competition, which assumes perfect
information, has no relation to competition (the process), except possibly as
the result of competition, after the process has completed its course.</p>

<h2>Production</h2>

<p>Production is the conversion of resources (inputs, factors, producer goods)
into products (outputs, consumer goods). In a market with production,
individuals can be grouped into resource owners, producers and consumers.
Producers are entrepreneurs who buy resources from resource owners and sell
them (in the form of a product) to consumers. Even if a producer owns one of
the resources himself, he must 'buy' that resource from himself in the form of
opportunity cost (what he could sell it for in the market). Production is
arbitrage (entrepreneurship), the exploitation of price differences.</p>

<p>Production is inherently entrepreneurial and competitive, and cannot be
monopolized. The situation of a single seller then must be analyzed taking into
account whether the position is the result of offering the best opportunities
to the market or the result of monopolized resource ownership. Monopolized
resource ownership can be the result of competitive entrepreneurial
activity.</p>

<h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>

<p>Entrepreneurship requires no resources to be initially owned, and 'pure'
entrepreneurship (a mental tool) is exercised only in the absence of resource
ownership.</p>

<p>Orthodox theory interprets human behavior as economizing (maximizing,
allocative, "Robbinsian"). Individuals apply given means to given ends, and the
best course of action is implied in these data. Changes in the means and ends
are exogenous.</p>

<p>Market process theory interprets human behavior as human action, a wider
view which includes the perception of means and ends. The orthodox individual
is a mere calculator. "Mises' <i>homo agens</i>, on the other hand, is endowed
not only with the propensity to pursue goals efficiently, once ends and means
are clearly identified, but also with the drive and alertness needed to
identify which ends to strive for and which means are available." (p. 34)</p>

<p>The entrepreneurial element of every human action is "alertness to possibly
newly worthwhile goals and to possibly newly available resources." (p. 35) With
perfect knowledge, the entrepreneurial element would be unnecessary, but in the
real world, knowledge is imperfect.</p>

<p>Economic analysis can be simplified by separating decisions into
entrepreneurial and economizing elements. 'Consumers' and 'resource owners'
economize, and 'entrepreneurs' display alertness (in real life, of course, an
infividual will fall into all the categories).</p>

<p>'Producers' are both entrepreneurs and economizers at different stages of
production. If the producer contributes an input (for example, managerial
skills), he is economizing. In deciding which inputs to hire and which outputs
to produce, he is an entrepreneur. As entrepreneur the producer decides what he
believes to be cost and revenue functions; as economizer the producer uses
those judgments to select a production process. The initial decision to
purchase inputs is entrepreneurial; once the inputs are acquiredm the decision
to actually produce (or to change the initial plan instead) is the decision of
a resource owner.</p>

<p>Profits result from resource ownership or from entrepreneurship. Owners'
profit results from an exchange, and is the difference between the value of
what is received and the value of what is given up. Entrepreneurial profit is
the difference between the price paid and the price received; nothing is given
up. Profit is usually the result of more than one decision, and so can be
viewed as either owners' or entrepreneurial depending on which decision is
being analyzed.</p>

<p>Capitalists are resource owners. A production process that takes time
requires capital, that is, resources advanced by owners who agree to receive
payment (with interest) at a later date.</p>

<p>Orthodox theory concentrates on the "firm" as the decision-maker in
production, and firm's behavior maximizes profit. In market process theory, the
firm is the result of a partially-completed entrepreneurial decision, being
basically an entrepreneur who has already acquired some resources.
"Profit-maximization" is not used to interpret firms' behavior. The producer as
resource owner maximizes the value of his resources, but as entrepreneur is
alert to new uses for his resources.</p>

<p>The corporation poses a problem for orthodox theory because 'control'
(managers) is separated from 'ownership' (capitalists or stockholders), so that
profit may not be maximized. In market process theory, there is no problem. If
the managers receive only their wages, they are hired resources; if they in
addition extract other (possibly nonmonetary) benefits from their position,
they are acting also as entrepreneurs; if instead, they steal benefits, then
revenue will not cover costs and they will be fired.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurship is not merely the possession of knowledge of price
differences; such knowledge can be hired, in which case the one who does the
hiring is the entrepreneur. Hiring itself can be hired (a personnel manager),
in which case the one who hires the hirer is the entrepreneur. The enterpreneur
is the one with the ultimate knowledge, the one who does the ultimate hiring,
the one who decides to bring all the inputs together to produce an output.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurship is the ability of individuals to learn from market
participation. This alertness to opportunities sets the market process in
action, generating changes in individual plans, eliminating price
differentials.</p>

<h2>Other Theories of Entrepreneurship</h2>

<p>"Naive profit theory" associates entrepreneurship with risk-bearing. It is
simply an input, and profits are its wages, resulting from having no
contractual claim to income. This definition leaves alertness (learning,
deciding to produce) unexplained.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/S/JosephSchumpeter.html">Schumpeter's</a>
 theory sees the entrepreneur as an innovator. The innovator
acts in equilibrium, disturbing it with innovations and creating opportunities.
Schumpeter recognizes that entrepreneurship is not an input and that profits
are not wages.</p>

<p>In market process theory, the market is already in disequilibrium, so that
the opportunities already exist, and the entrepreneur notices (not creates)
them. To Schumpeter, 'imitators' restore equilibrium (through price
competition) after the innovator's disturbance (through quality competition).
In market process theory, both imitators and innovators are equally
entrepreneurial, and both push a disequilibrium world closer to equilibrium.
Schumpeter's main mistake is to believe that opportunities for innovation could
exist in an equilibrium world, with perfect knowledge of products and
production processes.</p>

<p>Knight's theory is that profit is compensation for uncertainty-bearing.
"Profit is the residual, if any, left for the entrepreneur after he pays out
the contractual incomes agreed upon for the factors he hires." (p. 82) Knight's
view neglects the fact that every entrepreneurial venture is believed to be
profitable by the entrepreneur who starts it. Knight's theory ignores "the
active, alert, searching role" of the entrepreneur. (p. 83)</p>

<p>Market process theory is derived mainly from Mises' concept of
entrepreneurship. Mises (in <cite>Human Action</cite>, pp. 253-5, 288) sees all
profit as arbitrage. "Profit opportunities arise when the prices of products on
the product markets are not adjusted to the prices of resource services on the
factor markets. ... The entrepreneur notices this price discrepancy before
others do." (p. 85)</p>

<h2>Competition</h2>

<p>In orthodox theory, competition and monopoly are situations; the theory
models various market structures in equilibrium, labeling them 'competitive' or
'monopolistic.' The model of perfect competition is "the situation in which
every market participant does exactly what everyone else is doing, in which it
is utterly pointless to try to achieve something in any way better than what is
already being done by others, and in which, in fact, it is not necessary to
keep one's eyes open to what the others are doing at all." (p. 90) An obstacle
to competition is any deviance from the assumptions of the perfect competition
model.</p>

<p>The layman's definition of competition is the opposite, a rivalrous process
of trying to do better than one's competitors. The market process theory's
definition of competition is closer to the layman's; competition is "the active
process of offering the market opportunities which one believes are better than
those others are able or willing to offer." (p. 96)<p>

<p>In market process theory, an obstacle to competition is anything that
prevents participants from offering opportunities to the market (restricted
entry). The only possible barriers to entry are the use of force (including
government restrictions) and monopolized access to some resource. Pure
entrepreneurship is always competitive because it requires no resources.</p>

<p>In orthodox theory, monopoly is a firm's monopoly over a product. The
concepts of the firm and the industry are essential, and substitutability of
products raises problems. Monopoly is present whenever a firm faces a
downward-sloping demand curve. Monopoly is inefficient because it causes a
smaller output to be produced than perfect competition would. Welfare appraisal
requires looking at immediate allocation of resources.</p>

<p>In market process theory, monopoly is a resource owner's monopoly over a
resource. The mere fact that a producer is the sole producer of a given
product, or that a producer faces downward-sloping demand, does not imply
monopoly. A sole producer without sole access to a resource is under as much
competitive pressure as anyone else. A monopolist could even face horizontal
demand (for example, if he does not realize that the product produced with his
monopolized resource is a superior one). At the entrepreneurial level, the
demand curve is not a given, and so its shape is irrelevant. The industry and
the firm are irrelevnt to competition and monopoly, and competition and
monopoly are irrelevant to the firm (which is an economizer).</p>

<p>Monopoly is inefficient in market process theory is it causes a resource to
be underutilized. Welfare appraisal must consider the long-term effects of the
monopoly on the market process. Monopoly does not capture profits, but rents.
The monopolist need not product using his resource; he could instead hire out
to the market (receiving a higher price than if he were not a monopolist).</p>

<p>Quality is an economic variable as much as price and quantity. Product
differentiation may exist at any point simply because the market is not in
equilibrium (just as more than one price may exist at one time), and not
because of any lack of competition (as is claimed by orthodox models of
imperfect competition). The orthodox model of monopolistic competition is
inherently flawed because it assumes both product differentiation (leading to
profits) and free entry (which should eliminate profits).</p>

<p>The results of assessing monopoly often depend on whether the short- or
long- run is examined. Monopoly can result from initial endowments created by
the institutional setting (for example, in nonslave societies each individual
has a monopoly over his labor), in which case profits and disadvantages should
be attributed to the institutions. Monopoly can be the result of
entrepreneurial effort, in which case profits can be attributed either to the
monopoly position (short-run view) or to the entrepreneurial effort (long-run
view). A quasi-monopoly can be the result of an entrepreneur being the first to
exploit an opportunity when entry takes time; in this case the entrepreneur has
a temporary monopoly while others begin to assemble the resources to compete,
and this monopoly can be viewed the same way as the entrepreneurially-gained
monopoly.</p>

<title>Schumpeter's Capitalism</title>
<!-- Place: global -->
<!-- Time: 1900's -->

<h1>Notes on Schumpeter's <cite>Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</cite></h1>

<p>These are my notes on <a href="/revolution/by_name/S/JosephSchumpeter.html">
Joseph Schumpeter's</a> <cite>Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</cite> for
an economics project in college.</p>

<hr>

<p>Equilibrium models of market structure lead to the conclusion that the
smaller the number of firms in an industry, and the more influence those firms
have over price, the less efficient they will be in terms of output. U.S.
history from roughly 1900 to 1950 leads to the opposite conclusion. Industries
grew more concentrated yet "we cannot fail to be struck by the rate of advance
which, considering the spectacular improvement in qualities, seems to have been
greater and not smaller than it ever was before. If we economists were given
less to wishful thinking and more to observation of facts, doubts would
immediately arise as to the realistic virtues of a theory that would have led
us to expect a very different result. Nor is this all. As soon as we go into
the details and inquire into the individual itemsin which progress has been
most conspicuous, the trail leads not to the doors of those firms that work
under conditions of comparatively free competition but precisely to the doors
of the large concerns." (pp. 81-2)</p>

<p>Equilibrium models focus on price and quantity, and evaluate 'efficiency' in
terms of output, using output as a measure of social value. This leads to
incorrect interpretations of cases in which 'imperfect' competition "offers
compensations which, while not entering any output index, yet contribute to
what the output index is in the last resort intended to measure." (p. 82)</p>

<p>Market process is by its nature evolutionary not static. "And this
evolutionary character of the capitalist proces is not merely due to the fact
that economic life goes on in a social and natural environment which changes
and by its change alters the data of economic action ... The fundamental
impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new
consumers' goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new
markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise
creates." (pp. 82-3)</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs are the individuals who discover and implement those
innovations. Entrepreneurship "incessantly revolutionizes the economic
structure <em>from within</em>, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly
creating a new one," a process of 'creative destruction.' (p. 83 or 84)</p>

<p>Equilibrium models assume firms act solely with respect to the data, but in
the 'perennial gale of creative destruction' firms must constantly prepare for
changes in the data, for innovations. For equilibrium models, "the problem that
is usually being visualized is how capitalism administers existing structures,
whereas the relevant problem is how it creates and destroys them." (p. 84)</p>

<p>Equilibrium models cannot account for innovations; they assume that quality
cannot vary (a main target of innovation), they assume production technology is
fixed (another source of innovation).</p>

<p>A theory including innovation leads to different conclusions from those of
equilibrium models. Conditions of imperfect competition can sometimes be
necessary and more efficient than perfect competition, especially in the long
run.</p>

<p>First, output-restricting policies of firms are less important, because
innovation will render them obsolete, and they acquire a stabilizing role.
Restricting output (which leads to economic profit) can be a way of providing
for uninsurable risk. Insurance is normally included in costs, but allowances
for uninsurable risk are not, making price appear to be above costs. Some firms
will fail to avoid the uninsurable risk, and achieve losses, while others
achieve profits.</p>

<p>Second, some industries require conditions of imperfect competition in order
to exist at all, so that perfect competition leads to zero output. High startup
costs (no free entry) may require profits to justify investment. Variable sales
may require profit in one short-term period to cover losses in another
short-term period (perfectly competitive firms would not survive the losses).
Also, the possibility of profits is the incentive for innovation, which leads
to the greatest output expansion in the long run. Removing all profits would be
efficient from an equilibrium point of view, but would reduce innovation, and
so would be less efficient in the long run. Innovation has transition costs,
and restrictive policies of firms with the old product or technology may ease
the transition and spread the costs (retraining, unemployment etc.) over
time.</p>

<p>Third, price rigidity has the same new role as output restriction. Price
rigidity is prices being less sensitive to changes than they would be under
perfect competition. A product's price may remain constant, and thus seem
rigid, altough a new product offered at a lower price has superseded it.
Innovations may thus provide a form of price flexibility that is not seen when
focusing on one good. Quality may vary instead of price, as often happens with
the introduction of new products as they are tested and refined, so that again
price appears rigid but is not (price relative to quality falls). Price
rigidity may serve as a stablizing force, if the intention of the pricing
policy "is to avoid seasonal, random and cyclical fluctuations in prices and to
move only in response to the more fundamental changes in the conditions that
underlie those fluctuations." (p. 93)</p>

<p>Fourth, some conventional economists claim that imperfectly competitive
firms will stall technological progres in an attempt to preserve their existing
capital stock. This is contradicted by empirical evidence, because the vast
majority of large firms have well-funded research and development departments.
Also, innovations have transition costs, and the increase in productivity they
bring about may not cover these costs, especially considering that today's
innovation will be obsoleted by tomorrow's. Thus firms may appear to be
stalling progress when in fact they are simply minimizing costs.</p>

<p>Fifth, monopoly is not necessarily less efficient than other modes of
organization. Monopoly literally means "single seller," so most firms are
monopolies (because of product differentiation). Equilibrium models usually
redefine monopoly to mean single sellers whose markets are not open to other
firms, and whose products have no close substitutes. Monopoly will be less
important when considering innovation, which can provide a substitute. Such
cases are rare, and where innovation is possible, the few remaining cases will
have to behave as if competition is present (to discourage would-be
innovators). As is acknowledged by many equilibrium economists, monopoly can be
more efficient than perfect competition where economies of scale exist.
Further, profits (which in the equilibrium models arise solely from monopoly
power) are the incentive to innovate, and so can lead to more output in the
long run.</p>

<p>Last, static equilibrium models do not account for past or expected future
values of economic quantities, and can not account for unexpected change
(innovation included). Dynamic equilibrium models are an improvement, because
they take into account past and expected values, but still cannot account for
innovation, which is the prime mover of capitalism.</p>

<h1>Notes on Orthodox Economic Textbooks</h1>

<p>Notes on <cite>Microeconomics</cite> by Pindyck and Rubinfeld and
<cite>Economics</cite> by McConnell.</p>

<p>On methodology: "The economist must first ascertain and gather the facts
which are relevant to the consideration of a specific economic problem ... The
economist then puts this collection of facts in order and summarizes them by
'distilling out' a principle." (M., p. 3) "All sciences are empirical. All
sciences are based upon ... observable and verifiable behavior of certain
data." (M., p. 4)</p>

<p>Behavior: Consumers value given goods (P&R, pp. 58-9); consumers "maximize
the satisfaction they can achieve, given the limited budget available to them."
(P&R, p. 73) Firms maximize profits (P&R, pp. 246-7); "In larger firms,
managers have very little contact with the owners ... and can deviate from
profit-maximizing" although this effect is eliminated by competition in the
long run (P&R, p. 247).</p>

<p>Uncertainty is handled by assigning a probability (known = risk, unknown =
uncertainty) to each possible outcome; the range of possible outcomes is known.
(P&R, p. 134)</p>

<p>Entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurs decide to combine resources into products,
make business-policy decisions, innovate and bear risk, receiving profits as
wages. (M, pp. 20-1)</p>

<p>Market efficiency is measured using producer and consumer surplus, i.e.
benefits from quantity of a good bought or sold (P&R, pp. 289-325). "The
operation of a purely competitive economy provides us with a standard, or norm,
against which the efficiency of the real-world economy can be compared and
evaluated." (M, p. 546)</p>

<p>Competition: "Combination, conspiracy and cutthroat competition are all
means of reducing competition and escaping its regulatory powers." (M, p.
81)</p>

<p>"Advertising adapts consumer demand to the product ... the basic objective
of advertising is to persuade, not to inform ... Advertising expenditures as
such are relatively unproductive, they add little or nothing to the well-being
of society." (M, pp. 604-6)</P>

<p>Perfect (pure) competition: "all firms produce the identical product, and
each firm is so small in relation to the industry that its production decisions
have no effect on market price. New firms can easily enter the industry." (P&R,
p. 246) Firms face horizontal demand and "profit tends toward zero." (P&R, p.
270) Characteristics are "large number of independently acting sellers ... a
standardized or virtually standardized product ... no significant control over
price ... free entry." (M, p. 545)</p>

<p>Pure monopoly: "A monopoly is a market that has only one seller, but many
buyers." (P&R, p. 333) Characteristics are "single seller ... no close
substitutes ... price maker ... blocked entry." (M, p. 570) Barriers to entry
can include economies of scale, natural monopolies, monopolized resource
ownership, patents and research, and "unfair competition" such as "product
disparagement, pressure on resource suppliers and banks to withhold materials
and credit, the hiring away of strategic personnel, and aggressive price
cutting." (M, pp. 577-80).</p>

<p>Monopolistic competition: highly substitutable but differentiated products,
free entry and exit (P&R, pp. 422-3). Characteristics are "relatively large
number of small producers ... product differentiation ... nonprice competition
... relatively easy" entry (M, pp. 599-600).</p>

<p>Oligopoly: barriers to entry (P&R, p. 427). Characteristics are "a
relatively small number of firms ... homogeneous or differentiated products."
(M, p. 611)</p>

<title>Market Process Theory</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Market Process Theory</h1>

<p>This overview of the Austrian school of economics' theory of
entrepreneurship was originally a college paper by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/KenGaillotJr.html">Ken Gaillot</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>The study of economics is based on the premise that there exists
a regularity in economic phenomena, laws as inescapable as the law
of gravity. Economic theory seeks to establish these laws. One
essential aspect of economic theory, the theory of the market, tries
to explain the relationships observed under a system of private
property. Although most economists today follow an equilibrium approach
to market theory, the body of market theory associated with the Austrian
school provides a better understanding of market processes, being
able to explain events that equilibrium analysis cannot.</p>

<p>The Austrian theory of the market is one of market process, of
action, change and uncertainty. Exponents of Austrian economics,
also called subjectivist economics, explain economic activity in
terms of its ultimate cause, purposeful human action. Austrians
believe an economic theory is valid for situations in which its
assumptions are present, if the theory is logically consistent.</p>

<p>Conventional neoclassical equilibrium analysis takes a fundamentally
different approach. Reality is to be modeled, as it is in the natural
sciences, tested against empirical data, and refined if necessary.
Models make assumptions to simplify reality and focus on areas of
interest. An economic theory is valid for reality if the results it
predicts are present in the situation and the theory is logically
consistent.</p>

<h1>Community and Social Issues</h1>

<p>Functional, satisfying communities are built by the efforts of
everyone in them to achieve common goals. The trend in the 20th century
to nationalize all social issues takes responsibility away from
local groups, puts control in the hands of people far removed from
the actual problems, and results in a one-size-fits-all approach
that is inappropriate to the great diversity of human community.</p>

<p>Libertarians support having private organizations rather than
government trying to solve social problems.</p>

<title>Education and the Industrial Revolution</title>
<!-- Place: England (UK) -->
<!-- Time: 1800's -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Education and the Industrial Revolution</h1>

<p>May 1993, from <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/DavidFriedman.html">David
Friedman</a>:</p>

<p> I have just been reading a fascinating book: <cite>Education and the Industrial
Revolution</cite> by E. G. West. It is a history of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a> education through
the 19th century, and is interesting for three reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It provides strong evidence that a fully private system of education can
do a reasonable job of providing for the working class of (by modern
standards) a poor society. England around 1830, before the first government
subsidies of education, spent about 1 % of GNP on schooling. Fifty years
later, with a large government run sector rapidly replacing the private
sector, the figure was about 1.1%. And this was a period when incomes were
rising sharply, so one would expect relative spending on schooling to rise
(given that education seems to be a superior good) anyway.</p>

<p> West provides comparisons to a variety of other countries, including
Germany and the U.S., which had compulsory government run systems earlier
than Britain. So far as one can tell (the data, of course, are not very
good) both input and output measures (average number of years of
schooling--there do not seem to be any measures of quality of output that
are really comparable across countries) suggest that the British private
system in the early part of the century was doing as well as or better than
the other systems then and later.</p>

<li><p>It is an interesting account of how historical myths get created and
propagated. Numbers purporting to show the failure of the British system
were generated as part of the political process, then used uncritically by
later historians--who ignored other numbers, sometimes with much solider
evidence, that pointed the other direction. The most popular trick was to
compare the number of children in school by the number of children in a
specified age range, such as 3-13, and imply that the difference
represented children who never saw the inside of a school. Where detailed
studies were done, it typically turned out that almost everyone was going
to school, but for an average of less than ten years (I think about six).
The Prussian compulsory system, to which British reformers pointed, claimed
to have everyone in school--but for seven years, not the ten which the
reformers were using to calculate the gap in the British system.</p>

<p> Also, the reformers made much of Scotland's supposedly superior national
system of schools. It turns out that by the early 19th century, only a
third of the Scottish students were at (government run and subsidized)
Parish schools, with two thirds at private ("adventure") schools. And even
the Parish schools seem to have received the majority of their income from
school fees.</p>

<li><p>It is also an interesting account of the dark side of Benthamite
utilitarianism. There was a definite tendency for utilitarians to be in
favor of individual freedom in theory but centralized state direction (run
by them) in practice. On education, the division was between Bentham and
his disciples as the bad guys and Godwin as the good guy (arguing, among
other things, that the state was the last place in the world you would want
to go for moral instruction of the young), with John Stuart Mill caught in
the middle and straddling the fence. It appears, incidentally, that
vouchers were invented, at least in the 19th century, by <a
href="/revolution/by_name/P/ThomasPaine.html">Tom Paine</a>.</p>

</ol>

<p>In any case, I recommend the book highly. </p>

<title>Separation of School and State</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Separation of School and State</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/C/ChrisCardiff.html">Chris Cardiff</a>
posted a FAQ for the <a href="/revolution/by_name/S/SSSA.html">Separation
of School and State Alliance</a> to Libernet which is excerpted below.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why should school and state be separated?</h2>

<p>We should remove schools from government operation and influence for three
reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>One-size-fits-all doesn't work in a pluralistic society, especially for
character values.
<li>Government take-over of parents' duties is often met with parental
abdication of their responsibilities. Reduced parental responsibility hurts
children.
<li>Politically-run schooling can't escape the age-graded time-based model
imported from Prussia in the 1840s. Those offering glimpses of better
paradigms (e.g., John Holt, Maria Montessori) are all but scorned.
</ul>

<p>Our goal is the end of federal, state, and local involvement with
schooling. We believe government has no role in financing, operating, or
defining schooling, or even compelling attendance.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What's wrong with the common school concept?</h2>

<p>We don't have a common pizza, a common magazine or a common church. They
make no common sense. The way out of the "School Wars" is to drop the
1840s' notion of a "common school." Government has no business forcing kids
from different backgrounds into a one-size-fits-all tablet of values. The
Common School wasn't so bad for 100 years; they imparted the Protestant
majority's values to mostly Protestant kids. Some groups escaped (e.g.,
Christian Reformed, Seventh Day Adventist, and Catholics); others were
small and took their lumps (e.g., Jews, atheists, and Jehovah's Witnesses).</p>

<p>The flaw of the common school only became clear to traditionalists when the
tables were turned on them. Over the last 50 years, the modernists have won
control and now they use schools to impart their idea of "The Good." But
the traditionalists are not a tiny minority that can be abused with
impunity. They're escalating the school wars to try to "take back their
schools." Parent support for teachers is plummeting. Compromise is not
possible: Some want prayer in school, some want condoms. Printing prayers
on condoms satisfies nobody. Communities are split. Some even have to use
police to maintain order at school board meetings.</p>

<p>The way to get parents to support schools is for schools to support
parents, especially their tablet of virtues and values. Cultural and
religious pluralism in parents means we need the same pluralism in schools.
Kids are now being injured in the psychological equivalent of a vicious
custody battle.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What about irresponsible parents?</h2>

<p>The 1840s' municipal takeover of schools told parents they weren't
responsible for their children's education. It's the government's job. The
1890s' compulsory attendance legislation relieved parents of the awesome
burden of convincing children to attend school. It's the government's job.
The 1930s' Social Security told children they weren't responsible for their
elderly parents. It's the government's job.</p>

<p>The last three decades brought us government breakfast, lunch, health care
and after-school care. When governments usurp, many parents abdicate their
responsibility. Family life is weakened and children are harmed. This
usurpation/abdication two-step has been ratcheting downward for 150 years
and has been accelerating in the last 40 years. Government attempts to
rescue children from poor parenting are the great enabler of irresponsible
parenting.</P>

<hr>

<h2>What's wrong with the Prussian approach?</h2>

<p>The factory-model school was designed when children were more obedient and
the restless ones were allowed to learn by apprenticeship. Today's system
is a dysfunctional pressure cooker. Educators know better ways but politics
forces them to keep re-formulating the age-segregated, competition-driven,
time-based system designed by Prussians after their defeat by Napoleon.
Getting government out of schooling will allow the market to test
potentially good ideas invented by creative educators.</p>

<title>The Weak Case for Public Schooling</title>
<!-- Author: David Friedman, July 7, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1 align=center>The Weak Case for Public
Schooling<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></h1>
<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/DavidFriedman.html">David Friedman</a></p>

<p>It is often said that Adam Smith, despite his general belief in
Laissez-faire, made an exception for education. That is not entirely true.
In the course of a lengthy and interesting discussion, Smith argues both
that education is a legitimate government function, at least in some societies,
and that it is a function which governments perform very badly. His conclusion
is that while it is legitimate for government to subsidize education,
it may be more prudent to leave education entirely
private.<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

<p>My purpose in this essay is to argue that Smith's conjecture was correct
While government schooling,<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> free and compulsory, is at present
nearly universal in developed societies, the case for it is unconvincing.
There are arguments for government provision of schooling, as there are
arguments for government provision of any good or service, but the arguments
in favor are weaker, and the arguments against stronger, than the
corresponding arguments for other goods and services that we routinely
leave to the private market.</p>

<hr>
<h2>The Arguments In Favor of Government Schooling</h2>

<p>The arguments in favor of government involvement in schooling can be
roughly divided into four groups: Externality arguments, information
arguments, capital market failure arguments, and egalitarian arguments.
I will deal with them in that order.</p>

<ul>
<li><A href="externality.html">Externality Arguments</a></li>
<li><A href="information.html">Information Arguments</a></li>
<li><a href="capital.html">Capital Market Failure</a></li>
<li><a href="egalitarian.html">The Egalitarian Argument</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a href="history.html">History</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><i>In many areas of human activity there are two histories -- the
popular history, mostly mythological, and the real history ...</i></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2><a href="voucher.html">The Voucher Alternative</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><i>I have been considering two alternatives -- government and private
schooling. Another alternative, in some ways intermediate between the two,
is for the state to provide a fixed amount per pupil per year ...</i></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2><a href="conclusion.html">Conclusion</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><i>... Whether or not it is proper to have a
government system of schooling, it is prudent not to.</i></p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<p><a name="fn1">1.</a> This article is dedicated to E. G. West, to whom,
allowing for the usual timelag between ideas and policy, our grandchildren
will owe a large debt. Most of my historical discussion is based on
E. G. West,
<a href="/revolution/community/educate/books/west.html"><cite>Education and
the Industrial Revolution</cite></a>,
P.T. Batesford & Co., London 1975.</p>

<p><a name="fn2">2.</a> "The expence of the institutions for education
and religious instruction, is likewise, no doubt, beneficial to the whole
society, and may, therefore, without injustice, be defrayed by the general
contribution of the whole society. This expence, however, might perhaps
with equal propriety, and even with some advantage, be defrayed altogether
by those who receive the immediate benefit of such education and instruction,
or by the voluntary contribution of those who think they have occasion for
either the one or the other." (Adam Smith, <cite>An Inquiry into the Nature and
Causes of the Wealth of Nations</cite>, 1789 edition, E. Cannan ed., 1904
U of Chicago Press,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>:
1976, Bk V, Ch 1, Conclusion, p. ii 340).</p>

<p><a name="fn3">3.</a> I have chosen to refer to "government" rather
than "public" schools and schooling, because I find the latter terminology
misleading. A privately run school may be "public" in the sense that
differentiates a public hotel or restaurant from a private club -- it may
choose to accept all customers willing to pay its price. In this sense, most
government run schools are private, since they accept only students who meet
certain criteria, most commonly geographical. To describe government schools
as "public" on the grounds that they are run by the public is to identify the
public with the state, which I think is a mistake. Avoiding the term
"public school" also avoids confusion between the British and American
usages; a British "public school" is what Americans call a "private school."
I use "government" rather than "state" in the context of schooling in order
to avoid confusion with "state" in the sense of a political subdivision
of a federal system, such as the state of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a>.</p>

<h1>Social Insecurity</h1>

<p>Somewhere along the line, someone decided that since having a nice old
age requires long-term planning, efficient management of limited resources, and
a compassionate sense of community, we should turn retirement planning over
to the government.</p>

<p>Say what?</p>

<title>Welfare in New York</title>
<!-- Place: New York (USA) -->
<!-- Time: report August 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Real Price of New York's Generous Welfare Benefits</h1>

<p>August 1994, from Tom Carroll, President of CHANGE-NY (1-800-851-8881):</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ny/">New York</a> state's
welfare benefits are so high that a welfare recipient
would have to work at a job paying nearly $45,000 to break-even, according to
a study released today by CHANGE-NY, a statewide taxpayers organization with
over 100,000 members.</p>

<p>"It is often said that New York provides a Cadillac-style welfare program.
Rolls Royce is more like it," explained Tom Carroll, CHANGE-NY's president.</p>

<p>The CHANGE-NY study documents that the typical welfare recipient (a woman
with two children) is able to receive a tax-free welfare-benefit package
costing taxpayers $32,571 annually.   This figure encompasses the most common
and broadly used welfare programs in New York, including the AFDC basic cash
grant, Medicaid health coverage, and subsidies for food, housing, and energy
cost.</p>

<p>To have after-tax take-home pay of $32,571 from a regular job, a welfare
recipient would have to earn a salary of $44,900 annually, according to
CHANGE-NY.  By comparison, the starting salary for nuclear engineers with
college degrees is $32,200.  The $44,900 figure also is higher than the
statewide median household income, alomst four times the poverty level, and
almost three times the annual unemployment-insurance benefits.</p>

<p>The CHANGE-NY study also noted that sending the welfare recipient to
Harvard University would be cheaper than the current approach.  The cost of
tuition, family housing, meals, <em>and</em> campus health services at Harvard
is $31,692 per year-- less than what New York shells out annually for a welfare
recipient.</p>

<p>Carroll explained that while not everyone makes this much on welfare, many
do.  The example provided -- a woman with two children -- is the typical
recipient, contrary to the common stereotype of a single able-bodied male on
welfare.</p>

<p>"The impulse to be generous to those who fall on hard times is natural --
and commendable.  But the state's taxpayers simply cannot afford <em>this</em>
level of
generosity.  And, this so-called compassion is not in the interests of the
welfare recipient either, who would be better served by self-sufficiency
instead of long-term dependency," Carroll added.</p>

<p>Since 1982, New York has spent more than $180 <em>billion</em> waging the
"War on Poverty."  The result: the state's poverty rate went up, not down.</p>

<p>In 1982, New York had fewer than 1.3 million welfare recipients (AFDC and
Home Relief).  Today, New York has more than 1.6 Million welfare recipients --
a 25 percent increase.</p>

<p>CHANGE-NY today recommended setting a ceiling on the combined amount that
welfare recipients can recieve from all welfare programs, imposing a time
limit on the duration of welfare benefits, and providing welfare recipients
with a universal voucher or debit card in place of the existing web of
complicated, bureau cratic, and expensive individual programs.</p>

<p>ASSISTANCE PROGRAM and ANNUAL AMOUNT: AFDC basic cash grant, $2,856;
Medicaid, $13,664; Housing Assistance, $9,828; Food Assistance, $4,507;
Energy Assistance, $1,716. TOTAL $32,571. Pre-Tax Equivalent of Welfare
Benefit Level $44,900.</p>

<title>Canadians Tiring of Benefits</title>
<!-- Place: Canada -->
<!-- Time: 1990's -->
</head>

<h1>Canadians Reconsidering 'Benefits'</h1>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canada</a> in recent
decades began practicing the Santa Claus form of
government, giving its citizens an extensive package of welfare benefits,
from a comprehensive national health care system to generous welfare
allowances.</p>

<p>The predictable outcome of this has been huge increases in government
spending and debt, the steepest tax hikes in any industrialized nation,
income stagnation and rationing of "public" goods.</p>

<P>Federal and provincial Canadian governments are finally seeking to
cut spending in an effort to reduce taxes and debt. Prime minister Jean
Chretian expects significant cuts in health spending, welfare, pensions,
child care, homeless shelters and other entitlement programs.</p>

<p>The libertarian-leaning Reform Party made huge gains in the 1993 elections,
becoming the third-largest party in the lower house of Parliament, after
the Liberal Party and the Bloc Quebecois. The Conservative Party is also
doing well.</p>

<title>National Service</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1993-1996; report released March 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Clinton Puts "Service" in National Service</h1>

<p>When Bill Clinton was elected President in 1992, one of his pet
projects was AmeriCorps, a pie-in-the-sky program administered by
the newly created Corporation for National Service. AmeriCorps was
going to help students pay their way through college by volunteering
for good causes.</p>

<p>Typical of modern day boondoggles, the National Service program was
not presented as yet another massive bureaucracy handing out the dole,
but as an "investment" in the future of the country, funded by a
"public-private partnership".</p>

<p>In March 1996, less than four years after the program's inception,
the corporation's own inspector general announced that the program's
financial books were in such sorry state that they could not even
be audited. The corporation had incomplete and inaccurate records,
did not maintain adequate security over financial data, and ignored
some of the most basic rules of money management.</p>

<p>Not coincidentally, the cost per participant, orginally estimated
at $18,000, turned out to be $27,000.</p>

<p>In 1995, the corporation received nearly half a billion dollars in
government funding. That wild-eyed radical Republican-controlled Senate
recommended slashing that to only a measly four hundred million or so.
This fits in with the Republican motto: "We want a slightly smaller
government than we have today, but bigger than the one we had yesterday."</p>

<p>Libertarians oppose national service programs because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As evidenced above, they needlessly waste enormous sums of
taxpayer money. Whether they waste $400 million or $500 million is
not a useful distinction.</p>

<li><p>In the U.S., national service is not one of the duties assigned
to the federal government by the Constitution. One does not "phase out"
unconstitutional activity, one stops it.</p>

<li><p>"Voluntary" national service programs eventually lead to
a mandatory draft. When proponents see segments of society they don't
like (the rich for example) being underrepresented by volunteers,
they propose a draft to make sure everyone does their "fair share."</p>

<li><p>Government is unsuited to charity and compassion.
Government is force, government is prison, government is the barrel of
a gun. Any government-run attempt at providing charity is doomed to
failure, creating only dependency and undesired incentives.</p>

</ul>

<h1>Quotes on Welfare</h1>

<hr>

<h2>O'Rourke on Poverty</h2>

<p>In comparative terms, there's no poverty in America by a long shot.
Heritage Foundation political scientist Robert Rector has worked up figures
showing that when the official U.S. measure of poverty was developed in 1963,
a poor American family had an income twenty-nine times greater than the
average per capita income in the rest of the world. An individual American
could make more money than 93 percent of the other people on the planet and
still be considered poor.</p>

<h2>Jimmy Carter on the Great Society</h2>

<p>I would say of the Great Society programs of the Johnson years, all of
the federal programs that have concentrated on low-income areas, what
I tried to do ... what has been done by other leaders coming after me,
in general the failures have been abject and almost unanimous.</p>

<p>Former President Jimmy Carter, 1995.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Welfare State</h2>

<p>We ask that the government undertake the obligation above all of providing
citizens with adequate opportunity for employment and earning a living.
The activities of the individual must not be allowed to clash with the
interests of the community, but must take place within its confines and be
for the good of all. Therefore, we demand: ... an end to the power of the
financial interests. We demand profit sharing in big business. We demand a
broad extension of care for the aged. We demand ... the greatest possible
consideration of small business in the purchases of national, state, and
municipal governments. In order to make possible to every capable and
industrious [citizen] the attainment of higher education and thus the
achievement of a post of leadership, the government must provide an all-around
enlargement of our entire system of public education ... We demand the
education at government expense of gifted children of poor parents ... The 
government must undertake the improvement of public health - by protecting
mother and child, by prohibiting child labor ...  by the greatest possible
support for all clubs concerned with the physical education of youth. We
combat the  ...  materialistic spirit within and without us, and are
convinced that a permanent recovery of our people can only proceed from
within on the foundation of the common good before the individual good.</p>

<title>1996 Church Burnings</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: press conference March 1996, radio address June 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>1996 Church Burnings</h1>

<p>In the summer of 1996, the U.S. media widely reported a surge
in white racist burnings of black churches in the American South.</p>

<p>The church burning scare is the perfect example of how a crisis
can be fabricated and promoted with little basis in reality. American
politics and American media have become crisis-driven, and if no
crisis readily presents itself, activists will not let the truth
get in their way.</p>

<hr>
<h2>The Scare</h2>
<p>In a March 1996 press conference, the Center for Democratic Renewal (CDR)
and the National Council of Churches (NCC) announce a huge increase in
arsons against black churches by "a well-organized white-supremacist
movement." Their preliminary report showed an increase in such arsons
every year since 1990 and that all suspects were white.</p>

<p>Who were these organizations? The CDR is a left-wing political organization
whose main tenet is that white-against-black terrorism is on the rise.
In 1989, the Washington <cite>Post</cite> reported the CDR's findings that
racial violence and other hate crimes were sharply increasing, a conclusion
unaccepted by most. In 1994, the CDR reported that white supremacy was a
dominant force in U.S. politics and society, and that violent hate crimes
were increasing.</p>

<p>In 1995, the NCC hired a CDR board member who suggested investigating
church arsons. The NCC wanted to counteract the influence of the
religious right in politics, holding a meeting to address the
issue. Whites burning black churches provided the perfect vehicle.
"There's only a slippery slope between conservative religious persons and
those that are really doing the burning," said CDR chair C.T. Vivian.</p>

<p>Like many activist organizations, the CDR takes a core truth -- in
this case that racism is a problem in American society -- and sensationalizes
it beyond reality in order to gain funding for its ideology.</p>

<hr>
<h2>The Hype</h2>

<p>President Bill Clinton was running for re-election
and needed to shore up his support among the black community, where
prominent leaders were criticizing his record and even suggesting
third-party competition. In a June 1996 radio address, Clinton proposed
a federal task force to investigate church fires, and condemned the "racial
hostility" that was "the driving force" behind the arsons.</p>

<p>The federal government jumped in wholeheartedly. Clinton held a White
House summit on the issue with Southern governors, and assigned the head
of the Federal Emergency Management Association to lead a multi-agency
investigation. The BATF and FBI (experts in the field of
<a href="/revolution/firearms/enforce/waco/">church burning</a>)
assigned 200 agents to the project.</p>

<p>In July, the Church Fire Prevention Act of 1996 added church arson
to the growing list of federal crimes. No matter that the Constitution
does not authorize the federal government to deal with arson, thus leaving
it as a state issue. Another law, August's spending bill, authorized
$12 million to combat arsons of black churches.</p>

<p>The press dutifully responded. By June 8, 1996, over 2,200 newspaper
articles on the topic had been printed, most in a sensationalistic style
("Madmen Setting Fires of Hatred in South," a typical headline read).
Virtually every article accepted as fact that arsons of Southern black
churches were rising dramatically, that white racists were to blame,
and that the conservative political movement in general was
responsible for encouraging racial hatred.</p>

<p>The hype was successful in meeting the objectives of all involved:
the CDR raised around $9 million for its efforts, Clinton was re-elected,
and the press got its ratings for the crisis du jour. The NCC earmarked
at least $3.5 million of the funds it raised for rebuilding churches
to use for program advocacy -- left-wing politics.</p>

<hr>
<h2>The Reality</h2>

<p>President Clinton in his emotional radio address recalled "vivid and
painful memories of black churches being burned in my own state when I
was a child." As the Arkansas <cite>Democract-Gazette</cite> reported
the next day, no church burnings occurred in Arkansas during Clinton's
childhood.</p>

<p>At the August Democratic national convention, Clinton
condemned the painting of swastikas at Ft. Bragg as symptomatic
of widespread racism that leads to church burnings. In September, the Army
confirmed that the swastikas had been painted by a black soldier,
a fact reported as early as June.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/F/MichaelFumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
in the July 8 <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite> exposed the CDR's
faulty research. The CDR's report "regularly ignored fires set by
blacks and those that occurred in the early part of the decade, and labeled
fires as arson that were not." <cite>USA Today's</cite> statistics
showing a rise in black church arsons largely resulted from states
first starting to reporting data on the crime. No increase is evident
when looking only at states that reported data for the whole period
of 1990 to 1995.</p>

<p>Fires most definitely did increase after the press hype due to
"copycat" crimes. The new federal church burning army quickly found that
there was no widespread conspiracy. Those arrested varied widely from a
13-year-old Satanist girl to a black man generating business for his
brother's construction company. 16 of 44 individuals arrested for black
church arsons were black, and nearly half of all suspects were minors.</p>

<p>The bottom line: white racists burn less than ten Southern black churches
every year, a number that has not changed much in the 1990's.</p>

<h1>Quotes on Ethnicity and Race</h1>

<hr><h2>Jefferson on Native Americans</h2>

<p>The aboriginal inhabitants of these countries I have regarded with
the commiseration their history inspires. Endowed with the faculties
and rights of men, breathing an ardent love of liberty and independence,
and occupying a country which left them no desire but to be undisturbed,
the stream of overflowing population from other regions directed itself
on these shores; without power to divert or habits to contend against it,
they have been overwhelmed by the current or driven before it.</p>

the reputation, and the best interests of our country have long been
eager to proscribe. Although no law you may pass can take prohibitory
effect till the first day of the year 1808, yet the intervening period
is not too long to prevent by timely notice expeditions which can not
be completed before that day.</p>

<h1>Generic Ethnic Jokes</h1>

<p>Ethnic conflict and persecution is a longstanding human tradition.
Ethnic humor serves as a way for people to deal with it, and as such, is not
always to be condemned.</p>

<p>Insert your favorite ethnic group in the place of the ones I have
used in any of the jokes below. They also go well with residents of
particular geographic areas, graduates of certain universities
and various religious true believers.</p>

<hr>
<h2>The Toilet Seat</h2>

<p>Everybody criticizes dagoes, but you know they invented the toilet
seat. Of course the Germans had to come by later and cut a hole in
the seat.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Unwanted Miracle</h2>

<p>Three guys, one from Florida, one from Alabama and one from Mississippi,
are out in a boat fishing. All of a sudden, they see someone walking on
the water towards them! As he approaches, they realize it is Jesus.</p>

<p>The Lord approaches them and says, "Hello my sons, is there anything
I can do for you?"</p>

<p>The Floridian says, "I was a quarterback in high school, and I ruined
my arm throwing the ball, so I can't cast my fishing rod very well." Jesus
lifted his staff and touches the man's arm. It feels better at once, and
right then he casts further than he ever has before.</p>

<p>The Alabaman says, "I was a runner in high school, and I ruined the
muscles in my legs, so I can't take my wife out dancing." Jesus lifts
his staff and touches the man's legs. They feel better at once, and the
man gets up and dances a jig right there in the boat.</p>

<p>Jesus turns to the Mississippian, who is cowering in the opposite side
of the boat. "And you, my son?"</p>

<p>The Mississippian yells, "Don't touch me with that thing, I'm on
workman's comp!"</p>

<title>The Weak Case for Public Schooling: The Externality Argument</title>
<!-- Author: David Friedman, July 7, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">The Weak Case for Public Schooling</a></h1>
<h2>Externality Arguments</h2>
<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/DavidFriedman.html">David Friedman</a></p>

<p>The most common arguments for government schooling involve the claim
that it produces large positive externalities, that by schooling my
children I greatly benefit society as a whole, and that it is therefore
inappropriate to leave either the decision of how to school them or the
cost of doing so entirely to me. On further analysis, this claim divides
into three variants, one wrong and two dubious.</p>

<p>The simplest version is the one that is wrong. It is said that since
education increases human productivity, by educating my child I increase
the wealth of the whole society, making all of us better off. One obvious
problem with this argument is that, if correct, it applies to a lot of
things other than education. Physical capital also increases productivity;
does it follow that all investments ought to be subsidized? Better
transportation allows workers to spend more time working and less time
commuting; should we subsidize the production of cars? The argument
suggests that everything worth doing ought to be subsidized -- leaving us
with the puzzle of what we are to tax in order to raise the money for the
subsidies.</p>

<p>What is wrong with this argument is that it misses is the way in which
the price system already allocates "social benefits" to those who produce
them.  Building a factory may increase the wealth of my society -- but most
(in the limit of perfect competition, all) of the increase goes to the
investors whose capital paid for the factory. If I use a car instead of a
bus to commute, the savings in time is added either to my leisure or my
income. If education makes me a more productive worker, my income will be
higher as a result. That is why top law schools are able to sell schooling
to willing customers at a price of about twenty thousand dollars a year.</p>

<p>Schooling -- like a new car -- produces non-market benefits as well. But
these too go mostly to the student, enabled by education to appreciate more
of the riches of the culture he lives in. There may be effects on other
people as well, but they are typically small compared to the benefits to
the student, and their sign is not always clear. When my child becomes
an expert in Shakespeare and quantum mechanics one result may be to
enlighten and entertain her friends, but another may be to make them feel
stupid. In just the same way, the beauty of my new car may produce the
pleasures of aesthetic appreciation or the pains of envy in those who
watch me drive it down the street. To base the design of our institutions
for schooling on the uncertain effect on such third parties rather than
the direct effect on the schooled makes no more sense than to base the
design of cars on their value to everyone except the owner.</p>

<p>There is, however, at least one important respect in which my investment
in education -- or a factory -- does produce substantial external benefits.
Even if my income fully reflects my productivity, as it will tend to do
in a market economy, not all of my income goes to me. Some of it goes to
the tax collector. It follows that some investments, in factories or in
people, may not get made even though they are worth making, because the
share of the benefit that goes to the investor is not enough to pay the
cost of the investment. This inefficient failure to make some worthwhile
investments is one form of what economists call "excess burden" -- the
cost of taxation above and beyond the amount collected.</p>

<p>There is a problem in trying to solve this particular inefficiency by
subsidizing investments. In order to pay a subsidy one must collect a
tax -- and the additional tax increases excess burden at the same time
that the subsidy reduces it. Excess burden is an argument against
taxation, not for subsidy.</p>

<p>Another version of the externality arguments locates the externality not
in the increased economic productivity of educated people but in their
increased virtue.  Both religious and utilitarian variants of this
justification for government schooling were popular in the nineteenth
century. Conservatives wanted to use publicly controlled education to
teach the masses religious virtue. Many utilitarians, including Bentham
himself, believed that while freedom was a good thing in most contexts,
it was necessary first to teach people how to use their freedom -- which is
to say, to teach them utilitarianism. A form of this argument which still
remains popular holds that uneducated people are particularly likely to
become criminals, justifying government schooling as a form of crime
control. While I have not yet heard anyone argue that government
schooling is needed to make the public ecologically responsible, to
properly train the crew of spaceship earth, it seems the obvious next
step in the evolution of the argument -- considering what is actually
being taught to elementary school students in the more up to date government
schools.</p>

<p>The thesis has two versions -- education and indoctrination. The first
assumes that crime and sin are the result of ignorance rather than rational
choice. The evidence for this thesis is far from clear. As a general rule,
criminals seem to exhibit rational behavior in their crimes -- little old
ladies, for example, get mugged a lot more often than football players.
Criminals who have been caught and imprisoned frequently return to a life
of crime -- although that experience surely teaches them more about the
consequences of their actions than they are likely to learn in any school.
And, of course, even if ignorance is one source of crime, the argument
depends on the assumption that government schools are better at dissipating
ignorance than private ones. As we will see, both theory and history
provide reasons to doubt that.</p>

<p>The indoctrination version of the argument may make somewhat more sense.
In a private system, children will be taught what their parents want them
to know. In a government system, children will be taught what the state
wants them to know. So the government system provides an opportunity for
the state to indoctrinate children in beliefs that it is not in their
interest, or their parents interest, for them to hold. Insofar as some
virtues require one to act against ones own interest -- for instance
by not stealing something even when nobody is watching -- that is an
opportunity to indoctrinate children in
virtue.<a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>One good reply to this argument was made by William Godwin, who,
in 1796, expressed his hope "that mankind will never have to learn so
important a lesson through so corrupt a channel." To put the argument in
more modern language, government schooling does indeed provide the state
with an opportunity to indoctrinate children -- but there is no good reason
to believe that it will be in the interest of the state to indoctrinate
them in beliefs that it is in the interest of the rest of us for them to
hold. Many modern societies have strong legal rules designed to keep the
state from controlling what people believe -- the first amendment to the
U.S. constitution being a notable example. It seems odd to combine them
with a set of institutions justified as doing the precise opposite.</p>

<p>In an interesting recent article,<a href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> John Lott
explores the question of why schooling is controlled by the state in modern
societies. His conclusion is that government schooling is a mechanism by
which the state lowers the cost of controlling the population. Part of his
evidence is the organization of modern government school systems -- in
particular the almost complete absence of systems where parents choose the
school and funding is proportional to number of students, an arrangement
which would put pressure on the school to teach what the parents, rather
than the state, wanted. Part is a statistical analysis of data for a
large number of nations, designed to explore the relation between government
schooling and other characteristics of government.</p>

<p>One final version of the externality argument is the claim that my
education provides benefits to others because it makes me a more
rational voter.<a href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> While the argument is
logically correct, its implications are limited. It is perhaps best
understood as an argument for subsidy, not control. It is in my private
interest to have a correct understanding of the world around me, and such an
understanding will make me more able to evaluate government policy as well
as more able to make private decisions. The only argument for government
control is that it can force me to learn more about issues relevant to
voting, instead of issues relevant to private choice. The problem with this
is that the agency that does the controlling has its own interest with
regard to how I vote -- which brings us back to the indoctrination
argument.</p>

<p>A second problem with the argument is that it implicitly assumes that
different voters have the same interest, so that my rational voting
benefits you as well as me. For some issues this is no doubt true. But
other issues -- many of them in a modern state, unfortunately -- involve
attempts by one group to benefit itself at the expense of others. In such
situations, your rational voting may well make me worse off. Subsidizing
education in how to use the political system in ones own interest become
 the political equivalent of subsidizing an arms race, and equally
unproductive.</p>

<p>A final problem is that the argument works only if government run or
government subsidized schools actually educate better than private
schools. If the costs of government control more than cancel the
benefits of government subsidy, the advantages of educating students well
provide no argument for having the state educate them badly.</p>

<p>Externality arguments, not only for government schooling but for many
other issues as well, often make the mistake of adding up only
externalities with one sign -- positive in the case of schooling,
negative in discussions of population or global warming -- while ignoring
externalities with the opposite sign. The result may be misleading,
since it is the net externality that provides an argument for government
involvement. If my action benefits one person by a dollar and injures
someone else by two dollars, that is an argument against subsidy, not
for it.</p>

<p>What negative externalities might result from schooling? One I have
just mentioned -- you may use your improved education to more effectively
pressure the government to benefit you at my expense. A similar possibility
exists for private transfers. Ignorance may perhaps produce crime
-- but education produces more competent criminals.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that schooling may produce negative externalities
because it is used in the competitive pursuit of
status.<a href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> Consumption bundles of physical
goods and services are not the only thing that individuals care about.
If one reason I wish more schooling for myself or my children is so that
I or they will have more income or more degrees than my neighbor or his
children, and if my neighbor has similar tastes, then the gains of each
come at the othersexpense.</p>

<p>I conclude that externality arguments provide little independent support
for government schooling. At most they suggest that private schooling ought
to receive some subsidy -- and even that conclusion is an uncertain one,
given both the weaknesses of the arguments for the existence of net
positive externalities and the difficulty of separating subsidy from
control.</p>

the long run interest of the individual who possesses them, since they

<title>The Weak Case for Public Schooling: Information Arguments</title>
<!-- Author: David Friedman, July 7, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">The Weak Case for Public Schooling</a></h1>
<h2>Information Arguments</h2>

<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/DavidFriedman.html">David Friedman</a></p>

<p>Another argument is that government schooling is necessary because
parents, being themselves inadequately educated, are incompetent to
choose schooling for their children. As John Stuart Mill put it,
"The uncultivated cannot be competent judges of cultivation." This argument
concedes that government schools will teach what the state wants children
to learn instead of what their parents want them to learn, but views that
as an advantage of the government system.</p>

<p>This argument seems to justify at most one generation of government
schooling. Once we educate the first generation, they should then be
competent to choose an education for their children. The U.S.and Britain
have now had universal government schooling for at least five or six
generations. If it has done a good job of educating students it should
now be unnecessary, and if it has done a bad job perhaps we should try
something else.</p>

<p>A further problem with the argument is that most of what the government
schools actually teach -- or, too often, fail to teach -- is well within
the comprehension of virtually all parents. Insofar as the main business
of the schools is to teach children the basic skills needed to function in our
society, the childrens parents are usually competent to judge how good
a job is being done.  Even a parent who cannot read can still tell whether
his child can. And, while a few educational issues may go beyond the parents
competence to judge, parents <i>qua</i> parents, like parents <i>qua</i>
taxpayers, have the option of making use of other peoples expert opinion.
The crucial difference between the two roles is that a parent deciding
what school his child shall go to has a far stronger incentive to form
as accurate an opinion as possible than does a parent deciding how to vote.</p>

<p>Parents have one other advantage over educational administrators -- a flood of detailed free
information. By observing their children, and by listening to them, parents can learn a great deal
about how well they are being schooled. As West put it, describing the situation in England in
the 19th century, "Parents were their own inspectors and, compared with official ones, they were
not only much more numerous but exercised continuous rather than periodic check."<a href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Parental preferences have often clashed with  expert educational opinion -- but it has not always
been the parents who turned out to be in the wrong. Thus in Scotland, around 1800, parents
"Increasingly resisted traditional parochial school emphasis on classical languages and Religion
... . Parents complained that their children did not get their due in the school  By not having been
teached writing. <a href="#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a> Modern examples might include the controversies associated with the shift
away from phonics and towards the look-see approach to teaching literacy and the introduction
of the "new math" somewhat later -- both arguably among the causes of the massive decline in
the output of the American school system from 1960 to 1980. Parents have to live with the
results of educational experiments; the educators can always go on to a new generation of
experimental subjects. As Adam Smith put it:</p>

<p>"Were there no public institutions for education, no system, no science would be taught for
which there was not some demand; or which the circumstances of the times did not render it
either necessary, or convenient, or at least fashionable, to learn. A private teacher could never
find his account in teaching, either an exploded and antiquated system of a science
acknowledged to be useful, or a science universally believed to be a mere useless and pedantic
heap of sophistry and nonsense. Such systems, such sciences, can subsist no where, but in those
incorporated societies for education whose prosperity and revenue are in a great measure
independent of their reputation, and altogether independent of their industry."<a href="#fn10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>In a striking passage, E.G. West hints that much of the support for teaching children what they
ought to know instead of what their parents want them to know, in the past and presumably
today,depends on each expert assuming that it is his version of what children ought to know that
will win out:</p>

<p>"The French Physiocrats wanted a national system of education because they could use it to
propagate their new found knowledge of the  secrets of the workings of the economy. ...For the
nineteenth century cleric, the  ignorance which led to crime was primarily the ignorance of the
teaching of his particular church. For the utilitarian the crucial issue was ignorance of the laws of
the state or in other words the want of knowledge and effective warning of the pain that would
inevitably follow from certain actions. For Malthus it was the ignorance of his population
principle which mattered most. Public education for him was needed to suppress the
 sophistries of persons such as Condorcet.The latter happened to be the successful instigator of
French state education, and undoubtedly intended it to instruct according to his conception of
truth." West (1975) p. 123.</p>

<h1><a href="index.html">The Weak Case for Public Schooling</a></h1>
<h2>Capital Market Failure</h2>
<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/DavidFriedman.html">David Friedman</a></p>

<p>The special problems of investing in human capital are sometimes offered as an argument for
government intervention in schooling. If I wish to borrow money to pay for a profitable
investment inbuilding a factory, I can offer the factory as collateral. If I wish to make a
profitable investment in my own education, I have no similar option. Under the present legal
rules of the U.S. and most advanced countries, I can acquire the education and then wipe out the
debt by declaring bankruptcy. So profitable investments in human capital may fail to be made if
the human in question cannot finance them himself.</p>

<p>How important this argument is depends on whether the unit of analysis is the individual or the
family. If it is the family, then the argument applies to only a small fraction of the population.
Most families can pay the cost of schooling their children out of current income. Indeed, most
families do pay the cost of schooling their children out of current income -- in the form of taxes
to support government schools. Such expenditures might be harder for those with large families
and low incomes than they are now, and easier for those with small families and high incomes.
On the other hand, there is evidence that private schools provide a given level of education at a
considerably lower cost than government schools. If so, most parents would face a lower burden
under a completely private system. The market failure argument would then apply only to a
small fraction of families at the bottom of the income distribution.</p>

<p>So far as that part of the population is concerned, several points are worth noting. The first is
that it makes very little sense to construct a government school system for everyone in order to
subsidize investments in human capital for a few percent of the population. The second is that
the present system does a very bad job of educating just those people who would have the
hardest time educating themselves, which casts some doubt on the idea that it is, for them, an
improvement on a purely private system.The third is that the evidence of the nineteenth century
suggests that even quite poor people are able to provide their children at least a minimal
education. British workers of the early nineteenth century were very much poorer than the
inhabitants of Americas inner cities at present. Yet the evidence suggests that most were able,
without government help, to buy enough education for their children to provide at least minimal
literacy -- more than many inner city children get now.</p>

<p>Additional issues arise if we consider the problem from the standpoint of the child rather than
the family. Most families can afford to pay for schooling their children, but very few children
can afford to pay for schooling themselves. A private system depends, for almost all children, on
parents caring enough about the welfare of their children to be willing to pay the cost of their
education.</p>

<p>Most parents, in most societies, do care for the welfare of their children. In part this may be
explained by altruism, itself explainable on evolutionary grounds, and in part by the desire of
parents to have children capable of supporting them in their old age.These incentives are not
perfect -- there are parents who sacrifice the welfare of their children to their own welfare. But
the alternative to allowing parents to make decisions for their children is not, as a general rule,
having the decisions made by the children -- five year olds lack not only income, but information
and political power as well. The alternative to having a childs parents make decisions for him is
having other adults -- school administrators, politicians, voters -- make those decisions. Parents
may not always be altruistic towards their children, but a childs parents are, of all adults, the
ones most likely to be. The argument against letting the parents make the decision is an even
stronger argument against letting anyone else make it instead.</p>

<p>Here again, the empirical evidence is striking. Under circumstances of poverty difficult for most
of us to imagine, British parents of the early 19th century managed to send almost all of their
children to school -- not for as long as our children go to school, but for long enough to acquire
at least minimal skills. In this country a century later, immigrant parents routinely sacrificed
themselves to promote the education of their children. We have yet to see any similar level of
altruism on the part of those who control the government schools -- say a teacher strike aimed at
lowering teacher wages in order to leave more money to pay for books.</p>

<title>The Weak Case for Public Schooling: Egalitarian Arguments</title>
<!-- Author: David Friedman, July 7, 1993 -->

<h1><a href="index.html">The Weak Case for Public Schooling</a></h1>
<h2>The Egalitarian Argument</h2>
<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/DavidFriedman.html">David Friedman</a></p>

<p>A final, and powerful, argument against an entirely private system of schooling is that it
promotes and perpetuates inequality. Wealthier parents will spend more on their children,
making those children in turn better educated, more successful, and wealthier.This effect is
increased by the fact that family background is itself a strong predictor of school performance,
even with equal levels of expenditure. In order to give a child from a poor and badly educated
family as a good an education as a child from a rich and well educated family, it would, on
average, be necessary to spend substantially more on the former.<a href="#fn11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p>There are at least two possible replies to that argument. One is that our objective ought to be
education, not equality. If shifting to an entirely private system improves the education of  the
bottom half of the income distribution a little and the education of the top half a lot, both groups
are better off. Pursuing that line of argument would take me farther afield than I intend to go in
this essay.</p>

<p>A second reply is that while a completely private system would indeed result in unequal
educational accomplishment, so does our present government system -- and it is far from
obvious which leads to more inequality. At present, the quality of government schools varies
enormously and non-randomly from place to place. One reason is that high income suburbs, on
average, can and do spend more on their schools than low income inner cities, although in the
U.S. this difference has probably decreased in recent years as a result of legal pressures. A
second reason is that the children of affluent and well educated parents are, on the whole, easier
to educate and to be educated with than the children of the inner city poor. A third may well be
that affluent suburbanites are better than the inner city poor at getting political institutions to act
in their interest.</p>

<p>The first two effects would still exist in an entirely private system, but several factors might
reduce the inequality they now produce. A private system would be less rigidly geographical
than the present government system. Poor parents with bright children who were willing to
sacrifice for them, as many have been in the past, would have the option of sending them to
better schools instead of being limited to the school district where they happened to live. Such
arrangements are technically possible in a government system as well, and occasionally
permitted, but not often -- perhaps because they transfer power from the schooling bureaucracy
to parents.</p>

<p>Another advantage of the private system, from the standpoint of poor parents, is that parents
could control what they got without having to acquire political power -- which poor people, as a
rule, have very little of. Subject to the limits of their income, poor people have the same
economic power as anyone else -- the ability to choose whom they buy from.</p>

<p>A final advantage is that a private system might actually provide poor children with some
education. Under our present system, the largest determinant of educational output is family
background.One explanation of that is that parents are a major part of their childrens
environment and thus a major source of their education. But a second explanation may be that
our schools do not do a very good job of teaching, making children more dependent than they
need be on the education they get from those around them. If so, poor children, who are in more
need than rich children of things they cannot get from their parents, might well benefit more
from a general improvement in the schools.</p>

<h1><a href="index.html">The Weak Case for Public Schooling</a></h1>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/DavidFriedman.html">David Friedman</a></p>

<p>In many areas of human activity there are two histories -- the popular history, mostly
mythological, and the real history. In education, quite a lot of the real history has been
providedby E. G. West.<a href="#fn12"><sup>12</sup></a> In examining the history of the rise of government schooling in
Britain and the U.S., he has established several important points which go far to refute the
popular idea that mass education can exist only through the intervention of the state. They are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Schooling expenditure in Britain represented about the same fraction of national income prior
to government intervention and compulsory schooling laws as it did after both were introduced.</p>

<li><p>Prior to government involvement, almost all children were going to school. The opposite
claim, widely made in Britain by the supporters of government involvement, was based on fairly
simple statistical errors. The most common was to calculate how many children should be in
school by picking an arbitrary and unrealistic number of years of schooling and using it to
calculate how many children would be in school if all children went to school for that number of
years. The ratio of the number of children actually in school to the calculated number was then
treated as if it was the fraction of children who went to school. In practice, as West shows, more
direct evidence suggests that almost all children in the period just before the beginning of
government involvement (c. 1830) went to school for at least a few years. The discrepancy
between actual and calculated attendance mainly reflected actual school attendance for fewer
years than assumed in the calculation. </p>

<p>A particularly striking example of this fallacy was an unfavorable comparison of the British
private system to the Prussian state system, made by the Manchester Statistical Society in 1834.
The authors assumed that British students attended school for ten years, used that assumption to
calculate that just under two thirds of the children in Manchester attended school, and contrasted
that to the (claimed) hundred percent attendance rate of the Prussian system. The Prussian
system, however, provided for only seven years of schooling -- so even if the claim that every
child got the full seven years was true, the average years of schooling per child were about the
same in the two systems (7 in Prussia, about 6.5 in Manchester). The Statistical Society offered
no evidence that the British number represented two thirds of the students attending school for
ten years each, and later evidence made it clear that it did not. The actual number who never
attended school seems, from slightly later studies, to have been between one and three percent.</p>

<li><p>Attempts to measure educational output in the form of literacy, using both a variety of studies
at particular times and a crude measure (percentage of grooms who signed their names when
they got married) that is available over a long time period, show no significant effect of
government intervention. So far as one can tell by the (very imperfect) evidence, literacy was
already rising rapidly prior to the beginning of government subsidy. Most of the measured
increase in literacy had already occurred by the time a nationwide system of government schools
and compulsory attendance was established.</p>

<li><p>The eventual expansion of the government school system was in large part the result of efforts
by  the people running it, plausibly explained by their own self-interest. Its main effect was to
replace, not to supplement, the pre-existing private system.</p>

<title>The Weak Case for Public Schooling: The Voucher Alternative</title>
<!-- Author: David Friedman, July 7, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">The Weak Case for Public Schooling</a></h1>
<h2>The Voucher Alternative</h2>
<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/DavidFriedman.html">David Friedman</a></p>

<p>I have been considering two alternatives -- government and private schooling. Another
alternative, in some ways intermediate between the two, is for the state to provide a fixed
amount per pupil per year, which may be used to buy schooling from any of a variety of private
providers.<a href="#fn13"><sup>13</sup></a> How well does such a system deal with the problems we have discussed?</p>

<p>A voucher system solves some of the problems associated with market failure on the human
capital market. Families that are too poor to pay to send their children to school will be able to
use the voucher to pay for schooling. Parents who do not care enough for their children to be
willing to pay for their schooling will be able to use vouchers to provide schooling for their
children at no cost to themselves. A voucher system might also reduce educational inequality,
relative to both government and private systems. It would not, however, eliminate inequality,
both because parents would be free to supplement the voucher<a href="#fn14"><sup>14</sup></a> and because the parents
themselves are a major input to the childs education.</p>

<p>It is not clear whether a voucher system solves any of the other problems raised by a purely
private system. It is, for example, a poor tool for solving inefficiencies associated with positive
externalities -- supposing that one believes such externalities exist and are substantial. With a
voucher, the cost to the parents of an additional dollar of schooling is zero up to the amount of
the voucher and one dollar above it. That means that parents who would in any case spend more
than the voucher will buy the same amount of schooling with a voucher as with private
schooling.<a href="#fn15"><sup>15</sup></a> If there are substantial net positive externalities, that amount will be inefficiently
low. Parents who would have spent less than the amount of the voucher will now spend the full
amount -- which might buy more or less than the efficient amount of schooling. A better way of
dealing with such externalities would be for the state to pay a percentage of school expenses
corresponding to the percentage of net benefits that went to people other than the student and his
family. A voucher makes sense, from this standpoint, only if the optimal educational expenditure
is known and is about the same for all families  which seems implausible.</p>

<p>While vouchers give the wrong pattern of incentives for solving the externality problem,
government schools do still worse. A parent who wishes to give his child a thousand dollar
education when the government schools are spending only nine hundred dollars per pupil must
pay the full cost of sending his child to a private school: a thousand dollar cost for a hundred
dollars of additional schooling.<a href="#fn16"><sup>16</sup></a> If the additional schooling is worth less than the additional
cost, the parent leaves his child in the public school, where he gets less schooling than his parent
would have bought for him in an entirely private system. So a government system might result in
less expenditure on schooling than a completely private system -- making the inefficiency
associated with the failure to allow for positive externalities worse rather than better.</p>

<p>Whether a voucher answers the arguments of those who believe that parents are incompetent to
control their childrens schooling, either because they have the wrong objectives or because they
have the right objectives but not enough knowledge to achieve them, depends on how much
control the state exercises over schools that accept vouchers. This suggests an important
disadvantage of vouchers. If the government is paying the piper, it may well choose to call the
tune. If it is giving vouchers to pay for education, it will probably want to determine what counts
as education. Thus a voucher system, like a government school system, has the potential to be
used either to encourage indoctrination or to redirect "educational expenditure" to benefit
politically well organized groups such as school teachers and administrators. While one could
design a voucher system to minimize such problems, perhaps by permitting schools to qualify if
the mean performance of their students on objective exams matched the mean performance of
students at government run schools, it is far from clear that such a system could be either passed
or maintained.</p>

<p>A second argument against vouchers is that they may encourage wasteful expenditure on
schooling. During the two decades when the performance of U.S. schools, measured by objective
exams, plumetted, real expenditure per pupil roughly doubled. Under a voucher system, interest
groups selling inputs to schooling -- textbook publishers, teachers unions, and the like -- have
an incentive to lobby to raise the amount of the voucher above the optimal level of school
expenditure. While their ability to divert such expenditures to themselves will be limited by
quality competition among the schools, an increase in demand for their product will still tend to
raise its price. </p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<p><a name="fn13">13.</a> Some variants include the option of voucher
supported public schools. In others,the amount is different for
different sorts of pupils, or is payed out on the basis of performance
measures rather than years in school. For the purposes of this essay I
shall ignore such finepoints, and consider a simple version of the voucher
proposal.</p>

<p><a name="fn14">14.</a> Even if schools were not permitted to charge
more than the voucher, parents still could and would supplement their
children's education in other ways.</p>

<p><a name="fn15">15.</a> This conclusion ignores income effects due to
redistribution. Families with many children and low income will be net
gainers by a voucher; families with few children and high income will be
net losers. The former will tend to buy more schooling for their children
than without a voucher, the latter less.</p>

<p><a name="fn16">16.</a> If the only relevant dimension of schooling is
number of hours, this is not true; a parent can provide the extra hundred
dollars as privately provided after school tutoring. But if the relevant
dimension is quality rather than quantity of schooling, simply supplementing
what the government provides is not a satisfactory option.</p>

<title>The Weak Case for Public Schooling: Conclusion</title>
<!-- Author: David Friedman, July 7, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1><a href="index.html">The Weak Case for Public Schooling</a></h1>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/DavidFriedman.html">David Friedman</a></p>

<p>There are arguments in favor of having government pay for and produce schooling, as there are
arguments in favor of having government pay for and produce practically any good or service. I
have tried to show that the arguments in the case of schooling are not very strong. There are also
arguments against having government produce and pay for any good -- the arguments for
political failure combined with the general economic argument that private markets tend, at least
in some approximation, to produce the optimal output at the minimal cost. In the case of
schooling, there are additional and very powerful arguments against government control. One of
the most important is its potential use to indoctrinate the population in views that the
government, or the schooling bureaucracy, or powerful lobbying groups, wish people to hold.</p>

<p>In this regard, one of the great disadvantages of government schooling is its uniformity. Any
education can be viewed as indoctrination from the standpoint of those who do not believe what
is being taught. Under a private system, however, there is no single orthodoxy. Different children
are taught different things, reflecting the differing preferences of their parents and, to a lesser
degree, the beliefs of teachers, textbook authors, and other contributersto the educational
process. As adults, the graduates of such schools have the opportunity to correct the deficiencies
in their education by interacting with the graduates of other schools who have been taught very
different things. Under a government system, there is a serious risk that one official orthodoxy
will be taught to all.</p>

<p>A further disadvantage to state education, especially in a diverse society, is that it inevitably
involves a state religion. One cannot educate children without talking about issues on which
religions differ. The pretence of a religiously neutral education,at least in the U.S., is maintained
mainly by the tendency of teachers, like other people, to regard what they believe in as fact and
only what other people believe in as religion.  A government school system in a diverse society
is thus deeply divisive, since it means that some peoples children are being indoctrinated with
other peoples religion.</p>

<p>Many of the disadvantages of government schooling could be eliminated,or at least reduced, by a
voucher system. While such a system would be a great improvement over government schooling,
there seems little reason to believe that it would be superior to an entirely private system. The
great argument against it is that a voucher system must include some definition of what is or is
not schooling, in order to determine what can be paid for with the voucher. Imposing such a
definition on private schools implies the same sorts of problems of government control that
would arise with a government school system, although possibly to a much reduced degree.</p>

<p>I conclude that Adam Smith was correct in his suggestion. Whether or not it is proper to have a
government system of schooling, it is prudent not to.</p>

<p>Here is the list of books:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><cite>The Little Red Hen</cite>
(The tale is retold by many authors and illustrators)
R (B).  Read (several versions).  Read to 3-6.  
The hen benefits from the result of her labor.  This was recommended to me
more times than any other book.  Glance at the back of the book:  Children
like it when the hen shares with her chicks.  Some authors put in special
twists at the end, but I have not seen any I would warn against.  </p>

<li><p><cite>Things People Do</cite> by Anne Civardi (Illustrated by Stephen
Cartwright) Usborne, 1985, 38pp T, B, (FA, I).  Examined.  Read to 4-9.
Reader 8-11.  Describes the work people do in a wide range of jobs.  Set on
an imaginary island.  No hype; lots of fun.  </p>

<li><p><cite>The Araboolies of Liberty Street</cite> by Sam Swope (Illustrated
by Barry Root) Clarson N. Potter, Inc. & Crown, 1985, 28 pp
T, I, G. Read.  Read to 3-9.  Reader 8-9.  
The six-star general and his nasty wife make sure there is no fun on Liberty
Street by threatening to "call in the army".  The arrival of the Araboolies
changes everything.  The style of this book includes progression and
repitition making it great to read to small children (I do have to throw in a
couple asides, though).  The author creates an association between
intolerance and governmental force.  </p>

<li><p><cite>The Three Little Pigs</cite>,
<cite>The Ant and the Grasshopper</cite>,
<cite>The Emperor's New Clothes</cite>, and
<cite>Robin Hood</cite> (be sure it specifies that he's returning the

the poor)</p>

I (T).  Read.  Read to 3-10.  Reader 8 up.  The Caldecott Medal.  
In the middle of a cold night a little girl and her father walk silently
through the snow to search for owls.  The ritual of owling for this one
family binds the two in a lesson of hope.  </p>

<li><p><cite>Gino Badino</cite> by Diana Engel
Morrow, 1991, 32 pp
I, B.  Read.  Read to 5-9.  Reader 8-9.  
Gino, a mouse, works in the family pasta factory.  His creativity gets him in
trouble but eventually helps the family business shift to a special market
needed for the factory to survive.  </p>

Doubleday, 1980, 48pp
T. Examined.  Read to 5-8.  Reader 8-11.  Non-Fiction.

<title>Social Security Imploding</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1990's - 2025 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Social Security Crisis</h1>

<p>The U.S. Social Security program, formally known as Old Age Supplemental
and Disability Income (OASDI), and the Medicare program, formally known as
Hospital Insurance (HI), is in crisis, like a car careening off the edge of
a cliff.</p>

<p>"Crisis? What crisis?" say the Democrats.</p>

<p>"Maybe if we drive off the cliff a little slower," suggest the
Republicans.</p>

<p>Without major changes, Medicare will be bankrupt before the end of the
decade, and Social Security will be bankrupt within a few decades.</p>

<p>Many people have suggested raising the eligibility age for Social Security
and Medicare benefits. The argument is that health and life expectancy have
increased since the programs' founding. Some U.S. Senators have proposed
raising the eligibility age from the current 65 to 70.</p>

<p>In fact, the eligibility age is already scheduled to go up to 67 gradually
from the year 2003 to the year 2025.</p>

<p>This minor tinkering will delay the collapse of the government-run
pyramid scheme, but will not affect the underlying forces pushing the
programs to bankruptcy.</p>

<title>The Weak Case for Public Schooling</title>
<!-- Author: David Friedman, July 7, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1 align=center>The Weak Case for Public
Schooling<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></h1>
<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/DavidFriedman.html">David Friedman</a></p>

<p>It is often said that Adam Smith, despite his general belief in
Laissez-faire, made an exception for education. That is not entirely true.
In the course of a lengthy and interesting discussion, Smith argues both
that education is a legitimate government function, at least in some societies,
and that it is a function which governments perform very badly. His conclusion
is that while it is legitimate for government to subsidize education,
it may be more prudent to leave education entirely
private.<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

<p>My purpose in this essay is to argue that Smith's conjecture was correct
While government schooling,<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> free and compulsory, is at present
nearly universal in developed societies, the case for it is unconvincing.
There are arguments for government provision of schooling, as there are
arguments for government provision of any good or service, but the arguments
in favor are weaker, and the arguments against stronger, than the
corresponding arguments for other goods and services that we routinely
leave to the private market.</p>

<hr>
<h2>The Arguments In Favor of Government Schooling</h2>

<p>The arguments in favor of government involvement in schooling can be
roughly divided into four groups: Externality arguments, information
arguments, capital market failure arguments, and egalitarian arguments.
I will deal with them in that order.</p>

<ul>
<li><A href="externality.html">Externality Arguments</a></li>
<li><A href="information.html">Information Arguments</a></li>
<li><a href="capital.html">Capital Market Failure</a></li>
<li><a href="egalitarian.html">The Egalitarian Argument</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a href="history.html">History</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><i>In many areas of human activity there are two histories -- the
popular history, mostly mythological, and the real history ...</i></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2><a href="voucher.html">The Voucher Alternative</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><i>I have been considering two alternatives -- government and private
schooling. Another alternative, in some ways intermediate between the two,
is for the state to provide a fixed amount per pupil per year ...</i></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2><a href="conclusion.html">Conclusion</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><i>... Whether or not it is proper to have a
government system of schooling, it is prudent not to.</i></p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<p><a name="fn1">1.</a> This article is dedicated to E. G. West, to whom,
allowing for the usual timelag between ideas and policy, our grandchildren
will owe a large debt. Most of my historical discussion is based on
E. G. West,
<a href="/revolution/community/educate/books/west.html"><cite>Education and
the Industrial Revolution</cite></a>,
P.T. Batesford & Co., London 1975.</p>

<p><a name="fn2">2.</a> "The expence of the institutions for education
and religious instruction, is likewise, no doubt, beneficial to the whole
society, and may, therefore, without injustice, be defrayed by the general
contribution of the whole society. This expence, however, might perhaps
with equal propriety, and even with some advantage, be defrayed altogether
by those who receive the immediate benefit of such education and instruction,
or by the voluntary contribution of those who think they have occasion for
either the one or the other." (Adam Smith, <cite>An Inquiry into the Nature and
Causes of the Wealth of Nations</cite>, 1789 edition, E. Cannan ed., 1904
U of Chicago Press,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>:
1976, Bk V, Ch 1, Conclusion, p. ii 340).</p>

<p><a name="fn3">3.</a> I have chosen to refer to "government" rather
than "public" schools and schooling, because I find the latter terminology
misleading. A privately run school may be "public" in the sense that
differentiates a public hotel or restaurant from a private club -- it may
choose to accept all customers willing to pay its price. In this sense, most
government run schools are private, since they accept only students who meet
certain criteria, most commonly geographical. To describe government schools
as "public" on the grounds that they are run by the public is to identify the
public with the state, which I think is a mistake. Avoiding the term
"public school" also avoids confusion between the British and American
usages; a British "public school" is what Americans call a "private school."
I use "government" rather than "state" in the context of schooling in order
to avoid confusion with "state" in the sense of a political subdivision
of a federal system, such as the state of
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/">Illinois</a>.</p>

<h1>The Telecommunications Act of 1996</h1>

<p>On Black Thursday, February 8, 1996, after a year of controversy, the
U.S. government enacted the <a href="act.html">Telecommunications Act of
1996</a>, censoring the Internet and other telecommunications networks.
The blatantly unconstitutional law prohibited the transmission of "indecent"
material and information about abortions on telecommunications networks
such as the Internet. Speech that would be perfectly legal in conversation
or in print was <a href="banned.html">banned in the U.S.A.</a>.</p>

<p>In June 1996, a panel of federal judges found that the First Amendment
of the United States Constitution applies to the Internet, guaranteeing
free speech and rendering the indecency provisions of the law null and
void.</p>

<h2>The Exon Act</h2>

<p>On February 1, 1995, U.S. Sen. James Exon (D-<a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ne/">Nebraska</a>) introduced
the Communications Decency Act. His proposal broadened existing
law by subjecting individuals to up to a $100,000 fine or two years in prison
for any "obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" message transmitted
over a telecommunications network to a minor or with intention to "annoy,
abuse, threaten or harass."</p>

<p>The initial language of the bill additionally made the telecommunications
network provider (such as an Internet provider or telephone company) criminally
liable for such actions of their users. Later amendments removed this
provision, although providers would still be held liable if they are aware
of the transmission or if they do not a "reasonable effort" (defined by the
FCC) to prevent minors from accessing the material.</p>

<p>In March 1995, the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously adopted
a version of the Exon proposal as an amendment to the telecommunications
reform bill. In June 1995, the Senate attached the Exon amendment to the
telecommunications reform bill by a vote of 84-16. On February 1, 1996,
the final bill passed the Senate by a vote of 91-5, and the House of
Representatives by a vote of 414-16. On February 8, 1996, the bill was
signed into law by President Clinton.</p>

<h2>The Internet Reaction</h2>

<p>The Internet community reacted strongly to the threat.
115,000 Internet users signed an online petition to stop the
Exon bill. When the bill passed, thousands of World Wide Web sites protested,
many by participating in a <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.vtw.org/speech/">Web blackout</a>
(setting web pages' backgrounds to black) and displaying images of a
<img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.eff.org/BlueRibbon/">blue ribbon</a>. Protesters
<a href="winter.html">rallied</a> outside the White House after the
bill passed.</p>

<p>The ACLU challenged the law twice in court, first getting the
Department of Justice to agree not to enforce the law for seven days
while constitutional issues are settled, and then to
<a href="ciec.html">challenge the law</a> in a broad coalition.
An online newspaper <a href="challenge.html">challenged
the law</a> with an indecent commentary on it. Senator Patrick Leahy
offered a <a href="leahy.html">bill to repeal it</a>.</p>

<p>As a result of the challenges, a panel of federal court judges was
convened to decide the issue. On June 12, 1996, the panel unanimously rules
that free speech applies to the Internet, rendering the indecency
provisions unenforceable. The Clinton administration promises to
appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.</p>

<h2>The Meaning of It All</h2>

<p>This asinine affront to American rights exemplefies the approach
of freedom-killers. Today's would-be tyrants always invoke "the children."
The same people who are bankrupting the country; who are ensuring there
will be no <a href="/revolution/community/welfare/ss/">Social Security</a>
remaining when the next generation retires; who are sending American kids
overseas to fight foreign wars; who are diminishing in every respect
U.S. citizens' birthrights of property and freedom; these
are the people who want to protect children! These are the honorable men
and women, trying to protect us. God save us from our protectors.</p>

<p>Note to U.S. voters: this law enjoyed the widespread support of both
Democrats and Republicans. Bob Dole voted for the Exon amendment, as did
supposed "libertarian Republicans" like Phil Gramm, Jon Kyl, Connie Mack and
Paul Coverdell. Democrats were no better, with the Clinton administration
leading the charge. Only Libertarians are worth your vote! The
<a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LPUS.html">Libertarian Party</a>
was the <em>only</em> political party that participated in the net-wide
anti-CDA campaign, the <em>only</em> party to participate in the Web
blackout, and the <em>only</em> party to condemn the censorship.</p>

<title>Word 'Libertarian'</title>
<!-- Place: -->
<!-- Time: article published May 1955 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Good and Honorable Word 'Libertarian'</h1>

<p>What's in a name? Apparently a lot, as one of the favorite dead horses
beat by libertarians is what to call the freedom philosophy.</p>

<p>Those who share the philosophy of liberty mainly call themselves
libertarians, but some favor another term such as classical liberal,
Jeffersonian democrat, the Old Right or some such.</p>

<p>So where did the name come from? Kevin Carlin in a December 1995
message to Libernet gave this summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Oxford English Dictionary gives the first known usage in 1789 as
Belsham's <cite>Essays</cite>, in which he appears to coin the term in
opposition to <i>necessitarian</i>, which appears to have been a minor
and now certainly long deceased school of thought.</p>

<p>Our definition, "one who advocates liberty," does not appear until 1878,
probably long after the original use had faded, and appears to have really
caught on in the first decade of the twentieth century.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The modern libertarian philosophy coalesced
in the 1940's and 1950's from a rejuvenated economic defense of the
free market. The libertarian movement of this time is perhaps best represented
by the <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/FEE.html">Foundation for Economic
Education</a>, still active today.</p>

<p>In the May 1955 issue of <cite>Ideas on Liberty</cite>, FEE senior staff
member Dean Russell wrote, "Who is a Libertarian?," advocating the use of
the word libertarian.</p>

<h2>Who is a Libertarian?</h2>

<p>by Dean Russell</p>

<p>Those of us who favor individual freedom with personal responsibility
have been unable to agree upon a generally acceptable name for ourselves
and our philosophy of liberty. This would be relatively unimportant except
for the fact that the opposition will call us by some name, even though we
might not desire to be identified by any name at all. Since this is so, we
might better select a name with some logic instead of permitting the opposition
to saddle us with an epithet.</p>

<p>Some of us call ourselves "individualists," but others point out that the
opposition often uses that word to describe a heartless person who doesn't care
about the problems and aspirations of other people.</p>

<p>Some of us call ourselves "conservatives," but that term describes many
persons who base their approval of an institution more on its age than on its
inherent worth.</p>

<p>Many of us call ourselves "liberals," And it is true that the word
"liberal" once described persons who respected the individual and feared the
use of mass compulsions. But the leftists have now corrupted that once-proud
term to identify themselves and their program of more government ownership
of property and more controls over persons. As a result, those of use who
believe in freedom must explain that when we call ourselves liberals, we mean
liberals in the uncorrupted classical sense. At best, this is awkard, subject
to misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Here is a suggestion: Let those of us who love liberty trademark and reserve
for our own use the good and honorable word "libertarian."</p>

<p><cite>Webster's New International Dictionary</cite> defines a libertarian as
"One who holds to the doctrine of free will; also, one who upholds the
principles of liberty, esp. individual liberty of thought and action."</p>

<p>In popular terminology, a libertarian is the opposite of an authoritarian.
Strictly speaking, a libertarian is one who rejects the idea of using violence
or the threat of violence -- legal or illegal -- to impose his will or
viewpoint upon any peaceful person. Generally speaking, a libertarian is one
who wants to be governed far less than he is today.</p>

<p>...</p>

<hr>

<p>The word 'libertarian' enjoyed a renaissance in 1950's science fiction
as well, appearing in Robert Heinlein's 1953 <cite>Revolt in 2100</cite>
and Poul Anderson's <cite>Shield</cite>. Anderson even had a
fictional Libertarian Party represented in his novel and three short
stories.</p>

<h1>Criticisms of Libertarianism</h1>

<p>Libertarians rely on private property rights to prevent pollution. Critics
point out that nothing in libertarian philosophy prevents a waste firm from
buying a lake in order to pollute it.</p>

<p>Libertarians rely on the courts to settle grievances such as pollution,
child abuse, worker safety and nuclear accidents. Critics argue that this would
lead to unpredictability as different judges and juries would rule differently
on similar matters. Michael Nelson argued in the <cite>Saturday Review</cite>
that "it seems that almost everything in a Libertarian society would end up
being fought out by lawyers." Libertarians are also faulted for not specifying
how judges would be chosen and what standards they would use.</p>

<title>Libertarian Philosophy Books</title>

<h1>Books on Libertarian Philosophy</h1>

<p>From <a href="/revolution/by_name/H/TFranklinHarrisJr.html">T. Franklin
Harris Jr.</a>, Critic-at-Large, <cite>The Exchange: Culture,
Reason, Style</cite>:</p>

<p>The following is a list of books on libertarian philosophy -- or, more 
properly, philosophical defenses of libertarianism. It is not meant to be 
exhaustive, but, rather, is meant to reflect the best examples of 
philosophical libertarianism as defended by various philosophical 
standpoints: Aristotelianism, contractarianism, intuitionism, 
utilitarianism, etc. It is also limited (of course) by my own knowledge 
of the libertarian canon. For instance, I am largely unfamiliar with 
various Kantian defences of libertarianism, apart from the works of 
Hans-Hermann Hoppe included below.</p>

<p>I hope this list will help libertarians -- and, by extension, 
non-libertarians -- become more familiar with the moral basis for their 
beliefs and where that basis may or may not be lacking or in need of 
further thought. As Bastiat said, the worst thing that can happen to a 
good idea is, not to be skillfully attacked, but ineptly defended.</p>

<dl>

<dt><a href="/revolution/by_name/N/JanNarveson.html">Narveson, Jan</a>,
	<cite>The Libertarian Idea</cite> (<a
	href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/pa/Philadelphia.html">Philadelphia</a>:
	Temple University Press, 1988)</dt>
<dd><p>Narveson's book is one of the overlooked treasures of the libertarian 
canon. In this critic's opinion, his contractarian defense of liberty -- 
based largely on Hobbesian philosophy -- is the best defense of 
libertarianism currently available. Narveson utilizes game theory and 
value subjectivism to breath new life into the social contract.</p>

<p>The one major flaw in the book is Narveson's section on health care in
which Narveson seems to claim that it is possible to defend a national
health care system with the confines of libertarian moral theory. 
(Narveson, it should be noted, no longer holds this view.) But,
nevertheless, ignore this one unfortunate section, and you will find
Narveson's account inspiring.</p>

<dt><a href="/revolution/by_name/N/RobertNozick.html">Nozick, Robert</a>,
	<cite>Anarchy, State, and Utopia</cite> (New York: Basic Books,
	1974)</dt>
<dd><p>In professional philosophical circles, Nozick's work is regarded as
<em>the</em> definitive defense of libertarianism. Other libertarians --
myself included -- find his intuitionist defense of liberty lacking to say the
least. Still, because of the book's reputation, it is important for
libertarians to be familiar with <cite>Anarchy, State, and Utopia</cite>.</p>

<dt>Hoppe, Hans-Hermann, <cite>A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism</cite>
	(Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1989) and <cite>The Economics
	and Ethics of Private Property</cite> (Boston: Kluwer Academic
	Publishers, 1993)</dt>
<dd><p>Hoppe's Kantian defense of liberty rests upon the argument that it is 
illogical for one to argue against liberty as doing so places one with a 
logical contradiction. Hoppe argues that the ability to argue presupposes 
self-ownership, which presupposes an absolute right to private property.</p>

<p>So far, only Murray Rothbard has announced that he agrees with Hoppe. 
I remain unconvinced. Still, his work is useful and (depending upon your 
view) instructive in either how or how not to do logic.</p>

<dt><a href="/revolution/by_name/R/MurrayRothbard.html">Rothbard, Murray
	N.</a>, <cite>For a New Liberty: The Libertarian
	Manifesto</cite> (New York: Libertarian Review Foundation, 1978) and
	<cite>Power and Market: Government and the Economy</cite> (Kansas City:
	Sheed Andrews and McMeel, Inc., 1977)</dt>
<dd><p>Half the time Rothbard sounds like <a
href="/revolution/by_name/R/AynRand.html">Ayn Rand</a> (and other Aristotelians 
listed below), while the rest of the time he sounds like Hoppe. The mix 
of Aristotelian and Kantian philosophy seems incoherent to me but not, it 
seems, to most other libertarians. Apart from Ayn Rand, Rothbard is the 
most infuential libertarian theorist, thus, his works are essential reading.</p>

<dt>Merrill, Ronald E., <cite>The Ideas of Ayn Rand</cite> (La Salle, Ill.:
	Open Court, 1991)</dt>
<dd><p>Merrill provides the best critical introduction currently available to 
the philosophy of <a href="/revolution/by_name/R/AynRand.html">Ayn Rand</a>.
For my purpose here, his book is better than 
Rand's own, as Merrill provides a detailed discussion of how Rand's 
"Objectivist" philosophy relates to the modern libertarian movement.</p>

<dt>Tannehill, Morris and Linda, <cite>The Market for Liberty</cite> (New York:
	Libertarian Review Foundation, 1984)</dt>
<dd><p>The Tannehills' near-classic book is the best introduction to the 
anarcho-Randian viewpoint -- that is, anarcho-capitalism as defended by 
the philosophy of Ayn Rand. Rand, however, disagreed violently with the 
anarcho-capitalist view.</p>

<dt><a href="/revolution/by_name/F/DavidFriedman.html">Friedman, David</a>,
	<cite>The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical 
	Capitalism</cite> (La Salle, Ill.: Open Court, 1989)</dt>
<dd><p>David Friedman, son of economist Milton Friedman, presents the best 
defense of the anarcho-capitalist version of libertarianism available. 
(Although his discussions of moral theory are, I think, simplistic and 
self-defeating.) Friedman never shys away from the hard questions -- 
including the one with which anarcho-capitalists always have trouble: 
national defense.</p>

<dt>Machan, Tibor R., <cite>Individuals and Their Rights</cite> (La Salle,
	Ill.: Open Court, 1989) and <cite>The Virtue of Liberty</cite>
	(Irvington-on-Hudson, NY: Foundation for Economic Education, Inc.,
	1994) and <cite>Human Rights and Human Liberties: A Radical
	Reconsideration of the American Political Tradition</cite>
(<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>:
	Nelson Hall, 1975)</dt>
<dd><p>Machan presents the most scholarly and coherent case for the Randian
defense of liberty available. <cite>The Virtue of Liberty</cite>, in
particular, is a very good introduction to libertarianism. Machan, however,
typically casts Hobbesian libertarianism in an unjustified bad light --
usually with straw man arguments that, while they may apply to Hobbes's own
philophophy, don't necessarily apply to the philosophy of present-day Hobbesian
libertarians.</p>

<dt>Rasmussen, Douglas B. and Douglas J. Den Uyl, <cite>Liberty and Nature: An 
	Aristotelian Defense of Liberal Order</cite> (La Salle, Ill.: Open
	Court, 1991)</dt>
<dd><p>This book seems to have replaced (if only in libertarian circles) 
Nozick's as <em>the</em> book of libertarian philosophy. It is, perhaps, the 
most technical of all the book's I've listed -- sometimes, I think, 
overly so. And while I don't agree that Aristotelianism is either right 
or of use in defending liberty, the book is still full of insight.</p.

<p>Of particular note is the discussion of rights as "meta-normative" 
concepts -- a discussion that, I think, actually leads one to the 
conclusion that <em>any</em> teleological moral system (not just 
Aristotelianism) presupposes libertarian rights to life, liberty, and 
property.</p>

<H2>Tips</H2>

<p><b>Revolution</b> uses Excite for Web Servers, a concept-based
searching engine.</p>

<p>A query is simply a description of what you are looking for. If
you do a keyword search, Excite will return documents that have those
words in them. If you do a concept search, Excite does a more intelligent
search, returning documents that contain those words and related words.</p>

<DL>
<p>
<DT><B>Only use words that are relevant to your query</B></dt>
<DD>If you're looking for documents about the Widget2000, don't enter a
query like "<CODE>Find me all documents about the Widget2000</CODE>".
Excite for Web Servers considers <I>all</I> the words in your query to be
part of your information need, so queries like the previous example will
find all documents about <I>finding all documents about</I> the Widget2000,
which may not be exactly what you want.</dd>
<P>
<DT><B>Specify multiple forms of the same phrases</B>
<DD>Excite for Web Servers distinguishes between hyphenated and
un-hyphenated words. So, sometimes it might be necessary to explicitly say
that you want both versions, for example "<CODE>CDROM CD-ROM</CODE>". Excite
for Web Servers will try to figure out that <CODE>CDROM</CODE> and
<CODE>CD-ROM</CODE> are the same, but it never hurts to explicitly specify
multiple forms.</dd>
<P>
<DT><B>Common words are ignored</B>
<DD>Excite for Web Servers doesn't index common words like <I>a</I>,
<I>and</I>, or <I>the</I>.  Consequently, those words in your query will
be ignored. Excite for Web Servers also ignores numbers; however, it can
find strings that happen to contain a number, for example <I>3Com</I>.

<title>Courtroom Bloopers</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: books published 1977/1994? -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Courtroom Bloopers</h1>

<p>All of us make mistakes. But when lawyers and people testifying make
mistakes, they get recorded by the court reporter. Mary Louise Gilman, editor
of <cite>National Shorthand Reporter</cite>, collected courtroom bloopers in
two books, <cite>Humor in the Court</cite> (1977) and <cite>More Humor in the
Court</cite> (1994). Following are a few samples from those books.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  What is your brother-in-law's name?</p>

<p>A.  Borofkin.</p>

<p>Q.  What's his first name?</p>

<p>A.  I can't remember.</p>

<p>Q.  He's been your brother-in-law for years, and you can't remember his
first name?</p>

<p>A.  No.  I tell you I'm too excited. (Rising from the witness chair and
pointing to Mr. Borofkin.) Nathan, for God's sake, tell them your first
name!</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Did you ever stay all night with this man in New York?</p>

<p>A.  I refuse to answer that question.</p>

<p>Q.  Did you ever stay all night with this man in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>?</p>

<p>A.  I refuse to answer that question.</p>

<p>Q.  Did you ever stay all night with this man in Miami?</p>

<p>A.  No.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Doctor, did you say he was shot in the woods?</p>

<p>A.  No, I said he was shot in the lumbar region.</p>

<hr>

<P>Q.  What is your name?</p>

<p>A.  Ernestine McDowell.</p>

<p>Q.  And what is your marital status?</p>

<p>A.  Fair.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Are you married?</p>

<p>A.  No, I'm divorced.</p>

<p>Q.  And what did your husband do before you divorced him?</p>

<p>A.  A lot of things I didn't know about.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Doctor, how many autopsies have you peformed on dead people?</p>

<p>A.  All my autopsies have been performed on dead people.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Were you aquainted with the deceased?</p>

<p>A.  Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Q.  Before or after he died?</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Mrs. Jones, is your appearance this morning pursuant to a deposition
notice which I sent to your attorney?</p>

<p>A.  No.  This is how I dress when I go to work.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Did he pick the dog up by the ears?</p>

<p>A.  No.</p>

<p>Q.  What was he doing with the dog's ears?</p>

<p>A.  Picking them up in the air.</p>

<p>Q.  Where was the dog at this time?</p>

<p>A.  Attached to the ears.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  When he went, had you gone and had she, if she wanted to and were able,
for the time being excluding all the restraints on her not to go, gone also,
would he have brought you, meaning you and she, with him to the station?</p>

<p>MR. BROOKS: Objection.  That question should be taken out and shot.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Now, you have investigated other murders, have you not, where there was
a victim?</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  ... and what did he do then?</p>

<p>A.  He came home, and next morning he was dead.</p>

<p>Q.  So when he woke up the next morning he was dead?</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Did you tell your lawyer that your husband had offered you
indignities?</p>

<p>A.  He didn't offer me nothing; he just said I could have the furniture.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  So, after the anesthesia, when you came out of it, what did you observe
with respect to your scalp?</p>

<p>A.  I didn't see my scalp the whole time I was in the hospital.</p>

<p>Q.  It was covered?</p>

<p>A.  Yes, bandaged.</p>

<p>Q.  Then, later on ... what did you see?</p>

<p>A.  I had a skin graft. My whole buttocks and leg were removed and put on
top of my head.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Could you see him from where you were standing?</p>

<p>A.  I could see his head.</p>

<p>Q.  And where was his head?</p>

<p>A.  Just above his shoulders.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Do you drink when you're on duty?</p>

<p>A.  I don't drink when I'm on duty, unless I come on duty drunk.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Are you sexually active?</p>

<p>A.  No, I just lie there.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  Are you qualified to give a urine sample?</p>

<p>A.  Yes, I have been since early childhood.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  The truth of the matter is that you were not an unbiased, objective
witness, isn't it. You too were shot in the fracas?</p>

<p>A.  No, sir. I was shot midway between the fracas and the navel.</p>

<hr>

<p>Q.  What is the meaning of sperm being present?</p>

<p>A.  It indicates intercourse.</p>

<p>Q.  Male sperm?</p>

<p>A.  That is the only kind I know.</p>

<p>Two private security organizations plus a federal police agency patrol
the site. Eight-foot high barbed-wire-topped chain-link fence surrounds the

<title>False Environmental Pessimism</title>
<!-- Place: Global -->
<!-- Time: c.1960's-c.1990's -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>False Pessimism</h1>

<p>Excerpts from an article by Paul Geddes, originally published in
<cite>The West Coast Libertarian</cite>, 922 Cloverley  Street,
North Vancouver, B.C., V7L 1N3 Canada, Subscription: $15/yr.</p>

<p> For the past year, the Vancouver <cite>Sun</cite> has published a
daily "Voices" column to carry guest columns written by their readers.
Voices can offer glimpses of life from angles different than those usually
seen in newspapers but often it only reflects dreary conventional thinking.
A June 22nd column written by a too-old 19-year-old 'cynic' scarily shows
how mistaken beliefs about the environment have caught on with the public.
The student informs us that his "environmental geography (classes) in high
school and university" have led him to give up hope "for the forests, the
ozone layer and everything else precious and dying." He labelled himself
an "environmental defeatist" and has already decided not to bring any
children into this world.</p>

<p> You can't really blame a 19-year-old for parroting false chicken-little-ism.
That blame belongs to the pseudo-academics who filled
his head with pseudo-facts.  Now that he is a university student though, he
should be capable of verifying the claims of his chosen authorities.  And if
he is honest, in time, he should be able to obtain a more balanced and
optimistic view of man's achievements on this planet. To obtain a more
realistic appraisal of the current state of our environment, let me recommend a
couple books from my bookshelf.</p>

<p> Start with economist Julian Simon's <cite>The Ultimate Resource</cite>.
Written 15 years ago in response to another wave of false pessimism brought by
the publication of the now thoroughly discredited Club of Rome's <cite>Limits
to Growth</cite>, Simon examines the evidence for the future economic viability
of mankind.  He finds that natural resources and energy are getting less scarce
over time, that the world's food supply is <em>improving</em>, that pollution
in the richer countries is <em>decreasing</em> and that population growth is
evidence of economic success not human failure. In October 1980, putting his
money where his mouth was, Simon challenged famous environmental doomster Paul
Ehrlich and colleagues to a $1,000 bet that in ten years the price of any raw
material they selected would fall (measured in constant 1980 dollars).  In
October 1991, Ehrlich was forced to pay up, since the the prices of the five
minerals chosen (copper, chrome, nickel, tin and tungsten) had dropped
substantially. Simon wanted to renew his bet, upping the ante to $20,000, but
unsuprisingly, the ecologists were no longer interested.</p>

<p> Another more recent book (1992) is Patrick Michaels' <cite>Sound and Fury: The
Science and Politics of Global Warming</cite> who painstakingly reviews the
data about environmental apocalypse and finds the evidence wanting.  Michaels,
a professor of environmental sciences, mentions his consternation about being
attacked - not for any misstatements of facts - but rather his motives were
questioned for even daring to question supposed environmental truths.</p>

<p> The <a href="/revolution/by_name/L/LaissezFaire.html">Laissez-Faire
Books</a> catalogue carries a few other titles that should be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Kenneth Frederick and Roger Sedjo's <cite>America's Renewable
Resources</cite> in which the authors show, among other things, that U.S.
forests are expanding, that topsoil conditions are improving, that supplies of
good water aren't the problem but rather the weird government regulations that
under price and subsidize water misuse are.</p>

<li><p>Ronald Bailey's <cite>Ecoscam; The False Prophets of Environmental
Doom</cite> in which the author shows among other things that many of the same
pseudo-scientists who are proposed grand schemes of global economic
dislocation to "solve" the problem of global warming, proposed the same
regulations and higher taxes that were supposed to cure global cooling that
was the big scare back in the 1970s.</p>
</ul>

<p> Still pessimistic?  Take out your calculator.  Divide the world's
population by the area of Prince Edward Island, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/Canada/">Canada's</a> smallest
province
containing 0.1% of Canada's land area.  6 billion divided by 2,184 square
miles equals 2.75 million per square mile, about the population density of
the downtown areas of some of the world's most famous cities. Sure, not
everyone wants to live in a crowded urban centre, but life there need  not be
intolerable. In other words, there is room on this planet for many, many
more people. And I haven't even mentioned the huge technological changes that
are occurring all around us, right at this instant, daily making
communications, transportation and computing much cheaper and better.</p>

<title>Attack of the Wetlands Enforcers</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: July 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Attack of the Wetlands Enforcers</h1>

<p>By <a href="/revolution/by_name/T/JonathanTolman.html">Jonathan Tolman</a>,
environmental policy analyst with the <a
href="/revolution/by_name/C/CEI.html">Competitive Enterprise Institute</a>
(originally published in the July 18, 1994 <cite>Wall Street
Journal</cite>):</p>

<p> Last week the government released a massive five-year study showing
that the U.S. is losing only 66,000 acres of wetlands a year.  This may
come as a surprise to EPA Administrator Carol Browner, who claimed before
Congress in May that the figure was 300,000 acres.  The EPA and its
enforcers have been treating wetland regulation as an environmental
crisis.  Maybe someone should tell them the crisis is over -- before they
do any more damage. </p>

<p> To many property owners and entrepreneurs, the most troublesome
government agency is the Army Corps of Engineers, which compels the
observance of wetland regulations.  "The IRS is a walk in the park
compared to the corps," says John Piazza, president of Piazza Construction
Co.  In 1991, Mr. Piazza obtained a local government permit to build a
ministorage facility on a seven-acre tract of land in Mount Vernon, Wash. 
But before he could begin construction, "wetlands" were discovered on the
site. </p>

<p> Wetlands are technically defined as swamps, bogs, marshes or "similar
areas."  Mr. Piazza's wetlands supposedly fit into the last category. 
They were in three small sections and totaled less than an acre.  In any
case, Mr. Piazza designed his facility so that its construction would
affect only 0.18 of an acre of wetlands, small enough for him to apply for
one of the corps' exemptions, known as a "nationwide permit." </P>

<p> The corps had other ideas, however.  After several delays,
bureaucrats from the corps visited the site and decided that the wetlands
were adjacent to a "water of the U.S.," and thus not "isolated," as the
nationwide permit demands.  The corps determined that Mr. Piazza would
have to apply for an individual permit.  This would require an extensive
analysis of alternatives, an updated site plan, a mitigation plan, and
consultation with two other federal agencies, not to mention public notice
and comment. </p>

<p> As Mr. Piazza waited for his permit, the corps adopted a different
manual for identifying wetlands.  (The "similar area" category required
150 pages of explanation.) Under the new definition, his wetlands added up
to a mere 0.089 of an acre.  But even this did not release Mr. Piazza from
the corps' regulatory grip.  To date he has spent more than $25,000
responding to the government's efforts to preserve his wetlands.  At an
average cost of nearly $300,000 a wetland-acre, this is costly
conservation by any calculation. </p>

<p> The current regulations, as interpreted by the Army Corps of
Engineers, tend to treat every wetland as if it were a national treasure. 
During his three-year wait for a permit, Mr. Piazza gave one of his U.S.
senators a tour of his property in an attempt to explain his problem.  At
one point during the tour the senator asked how long it would take them to
get to the wetland.  Mr. Piazza replied, "You're standing in it." </p>

<p> The biggest tragedy of Mr. Piazza's situation is that draconian
command-and-control wetland regulations are no longer necessary.  In the
past 10 years the federal government has made dramatic changes in its
wetland policy.  The result is that the U.S. is currently RESTORING more
wetlands every year than it is converting to other uses.  (It does this,
for example, by buying fallow land from farmers and flooding it.) The U.S.
has effectively achieved what former President Bush repeatedly called for:
"no-net-loss" of wetlands. </p>

<p> In 1994, the government's top three wetland restoration programs will
restore a combined total of 157,000 acres of wetlands.  At the same time,
data from the government's National Resource Inventory conclude that the
U.S. will convert only 66,000 acres of wetlands to other uses.  In other
words, by the end of 1994 there should be tens of thousands more acres of
wetlands than there were at the beginning. </p>

<p> What is more, government agencies have developed cost- effective ways
to restore large tracts of wetlands without trampling on the rights of
property owners.  For example, the Agriculture Department's Wetland
Reserve Program will restore 75,000 acres of wetlands for less than $1,000
an acre.  This figure includes the cost of purchasing a permanent easement
on the land to ensure that it remains a wetland. </p>

<p> It would have cost the Agriculture Department $89 to restore wetland
acreage equivalent to what would be lost to Mr. Piazza's development.  In
contrast, Mr. Piazza and thousands of developers, home-builders and
property owners across the country are wasting millions of dollars hiring
experts, filling out permit applications, and paying loans and taxes while
they wait for the corps to reach a decision. </p>

<p> Unfortunately, after three years of waiting, Mr. Piazza still does
not have a permit.  Unless Congress acts to change the broad wording of
the 1972 Clean Water Act, the American people may have to wait even longer
for rational wetland regulation. </p>

<title>The Politicization of Science</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1992-1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>The Politicization of Science</h1>


<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/A/JonathanAdler.html">Jonathan Adler</a>,
Director of Enviornmental Studies for the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/C/CEI.html">Competitive Enterprise Institute</a>
(originally printed in the July 27, 1994 Washington <cite>Times</cite>):</p>

<p>Most who live inside the Beltway may not be enchanted with this 
summer's sweltering heat, but to Vice President Al Gore it must come as a 
relief.  After a frigid winter, the D.C. heat gives the vice president an 
excuse to talk about one of his favorite subjects, global warming, and 
how the world must mobilize to address it.</p>

<p> Mr. Gore is unwavering in his belief that industrial emissions of 
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases pose "the world's most 
important environmental threat."  Since 1986 he has claimed that "there 
is no longer any significant disagreement within the scientific 
community" about the menace of global warming.  More recently, he has 
compared global warming skeptics with Tobacco Institute flacks who deny 
that smoking causes lung cancer.  His greenhouse predictions are accepted 
by "the vast preponderance of serious scientists who have studied the 
evidence," Mr. Gore cries.</p>

<p> If there is such unanimity within the scientific community, it 
should be relatively easy to demonstrate.  Yet neither recent polls by 
Gallup nor Greenpeace could find the unanimous belief in a greenhouse 
apocalypse of which Mr. Gore speaks.  In 1992, the Science and 
Environmental Policy Project asked atmospheric scientists to sign a 
statement saying the type of policies advocated by Mr. Gore "are based on 
the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming follows from 
the burning of fossil fuels and requires immediate action."  It was 
signed by scientists from many prestigious institutions, including the 
National Center for Atmospheric Research, Woods Hole Oceanographic 
Institute, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, among 
others.  Presumably, Mr. Gore would argue that none of the signatories 
were "serious" scientists.</p>

<p> Mr. Gore would have a harder time trying to discredit the late Roger 
Revelle, whom Mr. Gore credits with alerting him to the possibility of a 
human-induced warming.  Revelle believed in a cautious approach to global 
warming policy and was not an advocate of extreme political measures.  
Shortly before he died he co-authored an article in <cite>Cosmos</cite> that
made this  view clear; the scientific evidence for greenhouse warming is "too
uncertain to justify drastic action at this time."</p>

<p> When this article was cited by Mr. Gore's opponents, he was 
understandably upset.  The response of Gore partisans and staffers was to 
engage in a hasty campaign to discredit the article and with it Mr. 
Revelle's co-authors, Fred Singer and Chauncey Starr.  At the suggestion 
of Mr. Gore's staff, one of Mr. Revelle's former associates, Justin 
Lancaster, attempted to have Mr. Revelle's name removed from the article 
when it was to be republished.  Moreover, Mr. Lancaster publicly charged 
that "Revelle was not an author" of the article and that his name had 
been listed under duress.  Mr. Lancaster even went so far as to suggest 
that Mr. Singer's purpose in listing Mr. Revelle as a co-author was "to 
undermine the pro-Revelle stance of [then] Sen. Gore."</p>

<p> These claims prompted a libel suit by Mr. Singer against Mr. 
Lancaster, in which Mr. Singer was represented by the Center for
Individual Rights, a public-interest legal group in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/dc/">Washington</a>.  The suit
was settled recently and Mr. Lancaster issued a statement in which he 
"fully and unequivocally" retracted his claims against Mr. Singer.</p>

<p> Concurrent with Mr. Lancaster's attack on Mr. Singer, Mr. Gore 
himself led a similar effort to discredit the respected scientist.  Mr. 
Gore reportedly contacted "60 Minutes" and "Nightline" to do stories on 
Mr. Singer and other opponents of Mr. Gore's environmental policies.  The 
stories were designed to undermine the opposition by suggesting that only 
raving ideologues and corporate mouthpieces could challenge Mr. Gore's 
green gospel.  The strategy backfired.  When "Nightline" did the story, 
it exposed the vice president's machinations and compared his activities 
to Lysenkoism: the Stalinist politicization of science in the former 
Soviet Union.</p>

<p> Mr. Gore's strong language and heavy-handed tactics in the global 
warming debate fit into a larger pattern of attempts by Mr. Gore and his 
minions to manipulate the scientific process through political force.  
Unsatisfied with challenging opponents in open debate, Mr. Gore and his 
staffers have resorted to sullying reputations and destroying careers.  
Gore loyalists were reportedly responsible for removing scientists from 
both the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation because 
they failed to toe Mr. Gore's party line.  Former FDA official Henry 
Miller claims similar events occurred at his agency shortly after Mr. 
Gore took office.  Lysenkoism indeed.</p>

<p> If there is an emerging scientific consensus in support of Mr. 
Gore's views, it is only because scientists are increasingly afraid of 
open opposition.  If science is truly in Mr. Gore's court, strong arm 
tactics and extreme rhetoric would not be necessary.  The scientific 
community would line up behind the vice president's pronouncements.  The 
reality is that Mr. Gore does not speak for science, and his views of an 
imminent and "devastating" global warming are overblown.  Climate change 
is an important issue, and that is ever more reason to leave it to 
science, and not the vice president's politics.</p>

<title>Environmental Overkill in the Gila National Forest</title>
<!-- Place: Catron County, New Mexico (USA) -->
<!-- Time: June 1994 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Feds Want to Poison Gila National Forest</h1>

<p>In June 1994, the federal government proposed poisoning 100,000 white trout
in streams in the Gila National Forest in southwestern <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nm/">New Mexico</a>, in order to
restock the creeks with 100 endangered Gila trout.</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_name/T/OrenTranbarger.html">Oren Tranbarger</a>,
a caver and backpacker who frequents Gila National Forest, reported in June
1994 that locals believe the real issue is control, not fish. By putting an
endangered species in the National Forest, the feds have much more control
over land use in the area.</p>

<p>Tranbarger reports that a recent public hearing, federal officials were
unable to answer questions about water flow in Mineral Creek or about the
size of their budget. Apparently they know little about either the area they
are trying to preserve or their own plan for doing so.</p>

<p>"The drug to be used to poison the streams is Antimycin A," said Tranbarger.
"Two creeks have been targeted: (1) Mineral Creek; and (2) Willow Creek. This
stuff would get into the underground water supply. At a public hearing May 17,
1994 at Reserve, New Mexico, the Feds (after being pressed) said they would not
drink the poisoned water."</p>

<p> Once the National Forest Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stock
the endangered species, they can regulate use of the surrounding area
indefinitely. They would likely prohibit or strictly limit such activities as
cattle grazing, hunting and fishing.</p>

<title>Catron County Movement</title>
<!-- Place: Catron County, New Mexico (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>New Mexico County Fights Feds Over Environmental Control</h1>

<p>The West has always been the symbol of individualism, and has often been
the site of anti-federal government sentiment. The latest trend here is
the "county movement," which rejects federal control of public lands.</p>

<p>As reported by Charles McCoy in the January 3, 1994 <cite>Wall Street
Journal</cite>, cattle ranchers reacted quite negatively when the Clinton
administration proposed restricting grazing on federal lands.</p>

<p>The center of the controversy is
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nm/Catron.html">Catron County</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nm/">New Mexico</a>. Like many
Western counties, most of Catron County is public lands -- 80% in fact. Now
some might wonder what a supposedly capitalist country is doing owning 80%
of the land, but that's not what the hoopla is about.</p>

<p>The argument made by county movement activists is that the federal
government illegally gained control of public lands in the 1800's, so
they have no right to regulate their use today. More than a hundred counties,
Catron County being the first, have passed ordinances prohibiting the Forest
Service from enforcing land use regulations. Catron also passed laws requiring
heads of households to own firearms and requiring environmentalists to register
with the county.</p>

<p>Sixteen of <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nv/">Nevada's</a>
seventeen counties have passed county-movement laws.
The phenonena has even arisen in counties in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/mi/">Michigan</a>
and <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nc/">North Carolina</a>.</p>

<p>A county-movement ordinance in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/id/">Idaho>/a> was declared
unconsitutional by an
Idaho state court, to date the only such law to be tested in court.</p>

<p>What county movementeers are really after is continued federal subsidies
for cattle grazing. Like rice farming in the desert, cattle ranching in Nevada
is only possible with taxpayer subsidies. Environmentalists, with more influence
in the current administration, have been seeking to end grazing, partly by
eliminating the subsidies.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the county movement is one of many substrains of antigovernment
sentiment that threatens to ignite into violence. Ranchers and other proponents
have threatened environmentalists and federal agents, are armed and are
prepared to defend what they consider their way of life.</p>

<p>Such battles can only be expected from political control of economic
resources. Only by privatizing public lands, and letting the market decide
what use will be made of them, will hostility be defused.</p>

<title>Bad News for Moses</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Bad News for Moses</h1>

<p>It seems that Moses is sitting in the Egyptian ghetto, things are going
terrible: the Pharoah won't even talk to him, the rest of the Hebrews are mad
at him for making the overseers even more irritable than usual, etc.  He's
about ready to give up.</p>

<p>Suddenly a booming, sonorous voice speaks from above: <strong>"You, Moses, heed
me. I have good news, and bad news."</strong></p>

<p> Moses is staggered. The voice continues:</p>

<p> <strong>"You, Moses, will lead the people of Israel from bondage. If the
Pharoah refuses to release your bonds I will smite Egypt with a rain of
frogs.</p>

<p> "You, Moses will lead the people of Israel to the Promised Land. If the Pharoah
blocks your way I will smite Egypt with a plague of locusts.</p>

<p> "You, Moses, will lead the people to freedom and safety. If the Pharoah's army
pursues you, I will part the waters of the Red Sea to open your path to the
Promised Land."</strong></p>

<p> Moses is stunned.  "That's, that's fantastic, I can't believe it!" he stammers,
"but what's the bad news?"</p>

<p> <strong>"You, Moses, must write the environmental impact
statement."</strong></p>

</head>

<body>

<h1>New and Improved World's Greatest Political Quiz</a></h1>

<p>I've lost the author and date of this piece:</p>

<p>Fed up with small, slanted political quizzes? I present a new unbiased 
political quiz which will enlighten you to your actual political views.
Just calculate your rating for each political category and see which one
is greatest.</p>

<pre>
I.   Your Conservative Rating                              1  0
- My moral views are superior to those of others.......... Y  N
- My prosperity is a result of God's favor................ Y  N
- Rush Limbaugh is the greatest hope for our nation....... Y  N
- A woman's place is in the home.......................... Y  N

II.  Your Liberal Rating                                   1  0
- All economic problems can be solved by taxing the rich.. Y  N
- Criminals are not responsible for crime, society is..... Y  N
- Values are a dangerous and evil concept, abolish them... Y  N

- Nothing bad can possibly happen in a free market........ Y  N
- The law of gravity is coercive, repeal it............... Y  N
</pre>

<p>And now that you have learned of your own political leanings, it is time
to test your knowledge of the other philosophies. Just match the phrase
with the political group it represents.</p>

<p>Our country would be so much better if we could just eliminate
<ol>
<li>atheists.
<li>the rich.
<li>the government.
</ol></p>

<p>All I want is for other people to
<ol>
<li>live like I do.
<li>let me spend their money.
<li>fuck off.
</ol></p>

<p>If I had $1 million, I would
<ol>
<li>give it to Pat Robertson.
<li>create a new bureaucracy.
<li>buy more land and fence it in.
</ol></p>

<p>All my opponents are just like
<ol>
<li>Adolph Hitler
<li>Adolph Hitler
<li>Adolph Hitler
</ol></p>

<title>Letters to IEEE</title>
<!-- Place: global? or USA -->
<!-- Time: magazine issue May 1993 -->
</head>

<body>
<h1>IEEE Letters Opposing Government Intervention</h1>

<p>From the Letters to the Editor in the May 1993 <cite>Computer
Magazine</cite> of the IEEE:</p>

<p>... In contrast, Boeing leads the world in jetliners despite (not because
of) DoD funding of R&D for a multi-engine jet tanker. DoD funded R&D for
other aerospace firms, but somehow, that never translated into market-leading
commercial products.  Indeed, many of those firms are no longer in (the
aerospace) business.</p>

<p>So it must take something other than abundant federal
R&D funding to enable a business to capture and sustain
market leadership in high-tech products.  And it is
that "something" that federal buereaucrats cannot
identify, let alone nurture.  Would an activist
industrial policy "help" the world-leading US computer
industry?  Hardly!  Would federal subsidies and regulations increase market
share for Intel or Microsoft? You must be kidding!</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>However, there is no such thing as the absence of
industrial policy.  So, if an activist policy can only
do harm, then the US should explicitly adopt a passive
industrial policy...</p>

<p>David A. Nelson, Information Engineering, Bellevue,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/wa/">Washington</a></p>

<hr>

<p>... On the issue of industrial policy and the government's role,
there are some examples of successful industry-government collaboration.  The
one cited in the magazine appears to be a success.  However, one
just has to look at government funding of supersonic
transport to find real failures.  Failure would probably be much more frequent
than success.  The problem is that money is generally cheap to government;  it
is
just taxes.  There is no one to call a halt to developments that are not
promising.</p>

<p>Stig Nilsson, Cupertino, CA</p>

<hr>

<p>As a native Taiwanese, I appreciate your high regard
for our "miracle" economy.  But I'd like to point out
that even a "successful" industrial policy is not
without its drawbacks.</p>

<p>Among the three most vibrant <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/">Asian</a> economies -- <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japan</a>,
Taiwan, and South Korea -- Taiwan has, in my opinion,
the best industrial policy.  Not because its policy
was better planned, better coordinated, or better
executed, but because Taiwan generally offers the most
"hands off" policy.  The strength of Taiwan's economy
has always been its small and medium size businesses.
Those small but highly nimble, totally market-oriented
companies and factories are the true heroes of the
"Taiwan Miracle."</p>

<p>... Japan's mighty Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) ... was, after all, the agency that
told Honda to stay out of the automobile business and
Sony to stay out of electronics.  Unfortunately for
their American competitors, Honda and Sony did not
listen.  It is striking to note that the majority of
Japan's most competitive companies are the ones who
received little or no help from their government.</p>

<p>... For the past 40 years countries like Japan and
Taiwan have been trying to catch up with us.  The path
of development was clear-cut for them.  It is obviously
easier to make decisions when you know exactly where
you are heading.  On the other hand, America has been
and always will be at the technology frontier.  It is
much more difficult to forecast your direction when
there is no one ahead of you;  just ask IBM.</p>

<h1>Lawyer Jokes</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Difference Between Catfish and Lawyers</h2>

<p>The difference between a catfish and a lawyer is that one is a
scumsucking bottom feeder, and the other is just a fish.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Lawyers and Lab Rats</h2>

<p>Scientists are considering using lawyers in place of rats in lab
experiments. Researchers get less attached to them and there are some
things rats just won't do.</p>

<hr>

<h2>That's Not Funny</h2>

<P>The problem with lawyer jokes is that lawyers don't think
they're funny, and no one else thinks they're jokes.</p>

<h1>Japanese Atrocities in World War II</h1>

<p>Everyone is familiar with Nazi Germany's heinous crimes against humanities.
Many are familiar with the Soviet Union's like atrocities and genocides, and
some are aware of fascism's grip on other European countries. But people are
just now beginning to realize the extent of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japan's</a> butchery during World War
II.</p>

<hr>

<h2>POWs</h2>

<p>As reported in the San Francisco <cite>Examiner</cite>, Japanese prisoners
of war were kept in inhuman conditions:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In August 1945, Melvin Routt was slaving on a Japanese work farm,
surrounded by sick and starving comrades, when he heard an American plane fly
over, a B-29. Suddenly, he heard an enormous blast and looked up to see a
mushroom-shaped cloud 17 miles away: the radioactive ashes of Nagasaki.</p>

<p>"It was time we did come up with a bomb to burn these people down. ... If
the people in this country realized what was done (by the Japanese) to our
soldiers, and to civilians, they just wouldn't stand for it," said Routt, 73,
of Tracy, national commander of the American Defenders of Bataan and
Corregidor.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>What happened to Routt and his buddies in a Japanese POW camp was so bad
that  "it took me about 10 years before I could even talk about it,"  he
recalls.  "(I feared) we'd be labeled the biggest bull slingers in town.</p>

<p>"We got no medical care. ... We'd eat lizards, worms, snakes,
grasshoppers. ... Most of our people starved to death. ... (The Japanese
guards) told us we wouldn't survive it, but would survive longer depending
on how we behaved. ... I went down to 83 pounds from 163."</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>The Nanjing Massacre</h2>

<p>In December 1937, the Japanese army invaded Nanking, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/China/">China</a>. In the following
six weeks, Japanese soldiers killed over 300,000 civilians and POWs. The
brutal murders included mass rapes, using Chinese civilians for bayonet
practice, and other atrocities.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]">
<a href="http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/NanjingMassacre/NM.html">Nanjing Massacre
memorial</a> and <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.cnd.org/njmassacre/">China News Digest's Nanjing Massacre
information</a>. The sites contain much information relating to the
massacre, Japanese denial of atrocities and related subjects.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Imprisonment and Torture</h2>

<p>The Japanese military imprisoned, enslaved and tortured prisoners of
war. Thousands of prisoners died. One prisoner, <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a> soldier Eric Lomax,
wrote a book about his experience.  Lomax was brutally tortured after his
captors found a radio receiver he helped make out of spare parts. Lomax was
beaten, his arms were broken and water was poured into his nose and mouth.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Sex Slaves</h2>

<p>The Japanese government only recently apologized to the thousands of
Korean and Chinese women enslaved as "comfort women" for Japanese troops.
For more information, see the <img src="/images/www.gif" alt="[WWW]"><a
href="http://www.ccnet.com/~suntzu75/comfort.htm">Viking Phoenix page on
Comfort Women</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Coverup of Crimes</h2>

<p>After the war ended, the U.S. government engaged in a concerted coverup of
Japan's war crimes. Only recently has the extent of Japan's crimes come to
light, and the U.S. government's coverup has been the result of scholarly
research in recent years.</p>

<p>Some researchers blame the coverup on the U.S.'s desire to turn Japan into
an ally against the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Other researchers believe the coverup was in exchange for the results of
Japanese human experiments relating to biological warfare.</p>

<title>PC Little Red Riding Hood</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Politically-Correct Little Red Riding Hood</h1>

<p>Posted November 15, 1994 by Tim Starr (<img src="/images/mail.gif"
alt="[EMAIL]"><a href="mailto:timstarr@netcom.com">timstarr@netcom.com</a>) to
LiberNet:</p>

<p>There once was a young person named Little Red Riding Hood who lived 
on the edge of a large forest full of endangered owls and rare plants 
that would probably provide a cure for cancer if only someone took the 
time to study them. </p>

<p>Red Riding Hood lived with a nurture giver whom she sometimes 
referred to as "mother", although she didn't mean to imply by this term 
that she would have  thought less of the person if a close biological 
link did not in fact exist.</p>

<p>Nor did she intend to denigrate the equal value of nontraditional 
households, although she was sorry if this was the impression conveyed.</p>

<p>One day her mother asked her to take a basket of organically grown 
fruit and  mineral water to her grandmother's house.</p>

<p>"But mother, won't this be stealing work from the unionized people 
who have struggled for years to earn the right to carry all packages 
between various people in the woods?"</p>

<p>Red Riding Hood's mother assured her that she had called the union 
boss and gotten a special compassionate mission exemption form.</p>

<p>"But mother, aren't you oppressing me by ordering me to do this?"</p>

<p>Red Riding Hood's mother pointed out that it was impossible for 
womyn to oppress each other, since all womyn were equally oppressed until 
all womyn were free.</p>

<p>"But mother, then shouldn't you have my brother carry the basket, 
since he's an oppressor, and should learn what it's like to be oppressed?"</p>

<p>And Red Riding Hood's mother explained that her brother was 
attending a special rally for animal rights, and besides, this wasn't 
stereotypical womyn's work, but an empowering deed that would help 
engender a feeling of community.</p>

<p>"But won't I be oppressing Grandma, by implying that she's sick and 
hence unable to independently further her own selfhood?"</p>

<p>But Red Riding Hood's mother explained that her grandmother wasn't 
actually sick or incapacitated or mentally handicapped in any way, 
although that was not to imply that any of these conditions were inferior 
to what some people called "health".</p>

<p>Thus Red Riding Hood felt that she could get behind the idea of 
delivering the basket to her grandmother, and so she set off.</p>

<p>Many people believed that the forest was a foreboding and dangerous  
place, but Red Riding Hood knew that this was an irrational fear based on 
cultural paradigms instilled by a patriarchal society that regarded the 
natural world as an exploitable resource, and hence believed that natural 
predators were in fact intolerable competitors.</p>

<p>Other people avoided the woods for fear of thieves and deviants, but 
Red Riding Hood felt that in a truly classless society all marginalized 
peoples would be able to "come out" of the woods and be accepted as valid 
lifestyle role models.</p>

<p>On her way to Grandma's house, Red Riding Hood passed a woodchopper, 
and wandered off the path, in order to examine some flowers.</p>

<p>She was startled to find herself standing before a Wolf, who asked 
her what  was in her basket.</p>

<p>Red Riding Hood's teacher had warned her never to talk to strangers, 
but she was confident in taking control of her own budding sexuality, and 
chose to dialogue with the Wolf.</p>

<p>She replied, "I am taking my Grandmother some healthful snacks in a 
gesture of solidarity."</p>

<p>The Wolf said, "You know, my dear, it isn't safe for a little girl 
to walk  through these woods alone."</p>

<p>Red Riding Hood said, "I find your sexist remark offensive in the 
extreme, but  I will ignore it because of your traditional status as an 
outcast from society,  the stress of which has caused you to develop an 
alternative and yet entirely valid worldview.  Now, if you'll excuse me, 
I would prefer to be on my way."</p>

<p>Red Riding Hood returned to the main path, and proceeded towards her 
grandmother's house.</p>

<p>But because his status outside society had freed him from slavish 
adherence to linear, Western-style thought, the Wolf knew of a quicker 
route to Grandma's house.</p>

<p>He burst into the house and ate Grandma, a course of action 
affirmative of his nature as a predator.</p>

<p>Then, unhampered by rigid, traditionalist gender role notions, he 
put on  Grandma's nightclothes, crawled under the bedclothes, and awaited 
developments.</p>

<p>Red Riding Hood entered the cottage and said, </p>

<p>"Grandma, I have brought you some cruelty free snacks to salute you 
in your role of wise and nurturing matriarch."</p>

<p>The Wolf said softly "Come closer, child, so that I might see you."</p>

<p>Red Riding Hood said, "Goddess!  Grandma, what big eyes you have!"</p>

<p>"You forget that I am optically challenged."</p>

<p>"And Grandma, what an enormous, what a fine nose you have."</p>

<p>"Naturally, I could have had it fixed to help my acting career, but 
I didn't give in to such societal pressures, my child."</p>

<p>"And Grandma, what very big, sharp teeth you have!"</p>

<p>The Wolf could not take any more of these specist slurs, and, in a 
reaction appropriate for his accustomed milieu, he leaped out of bed, 
grabbed Little Red Riding Hood, and opened his jaws so wide that she 
could see her poor Grandmother cowering in his belly.</p>

<p>"Aren't you forgetting something?" Red Riding Hood bravely shouted.  
"You must request my permission before proceeding to a new level of 
intimacy!"</p>

<p>The Wolf was so startled by this statement that he loosened his 
grasp on her.</p>

<p>At the same time, the woodchopper burst into the cottage, brandishing an
ax.</p>

<p>"Hands off!" cried the woodchopper.</p>

<p> "And what do you think you're doing?" cried Little Red Riding Hood.  
"If I let  you help me now, I would be expressing a lack of confidence in 
my own abilities, which would lead to poor self esteem and lower 
achievement scores on college entrance exams."</p>

<p>"Last chance, sister!  Get your hands off that endangered species!  
This is an FBI sting!" screamed the woodchopper, and when Little Red 
Riding Hood nonetheless made a sudden motion, he sliced off her head. </p>

<p>"Thank goodness you got here in time," said the Wolf.  "The brat and 
her grandmother lured me in here.  I thought I was a goner."</p>

<p>"No, I think I'm the real victim, here," said the woodchopper.  
"I've been dealing with my anger ever since I saw her picking those 
protected flowers earlier.  And now I'm going to have such a trauma.  Do 
you have any aspirin?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said the Wolf.</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>"I feel your pain," said the Wolf, and he patted the woodchopper on 
his firm, well padded back, gave a little belch, and said "Do you have 
any Maalox?"</p>

<title>Teaching About Politics</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Teach Your Child About Politics</h1>

<p>by Joseph Sobran</p>

<p>Because I write about politics, people are forever asking me the best
way to teach children how our system of government works. I tell them
that they can give their own children a basic civics course right in
their own homes.</p>

<p>In my own experience as a father, I have discovered several simple
devices that can illustrate to a child's mind the principles on which
the modern state deals with its citizens. You may find them helpful,
too.</p>

<p>For example, I used to play the simple card game WAR with my son.
After a while, when he thoroughly understood that the higher
ranking cards beat the lower ranking ones, I created a new game I called
GOVERNMENT. In this game, I was Government, and I won
every trick, regardless of who had the better card. My boy soon
lost interest in my new game, but I like to think it taught him
a valuable lesson for later in life.</p>

<p>When your child is a little older, you can teach him about our
tax system in a way that is easy to grasp. Offer him, say, $10 to mow the
lawn. When he has mowed it and asks to be paid, withhold $5 and explain
that this is income tax. Give $1 to his younger brother, and tell him
that this is "fair". Also, explain that you need the other $4 yourself
to cover the administrative costs of dividing the money. When he cries,
tell him he is being "selfish" and "greedy". Later in life he will thank
you.</p>

<p>Make as many rules as possible. Leave the reasons for them
obscure. Enforce them arbitrarily. Accuse your child of
breaking rules you have never told him about. Keep him anxious
that he may be violating commands you haven't yet issued. Instill in him the
feeling that rules are utterly irrational. This will prepare him for living
under
democratic government.</p>

<p>When your child has matured sufficiently to understand how the
judicial system works, set a bedtime for him and then send him
to bed an hour early. When he tearfully accuses you of breaking
the rules, explain that you made the rules and you can interpret
them in any way that seems appropriate to you, according to
changing conditions. This will prepare him for the Supreme
Court's concept of the U.S. Constitution as a "living document".</p>

<p>Promise often to take him to the movies or the zoo, and then,
at the appointed hour, recline in an easy chair with a newspaper
and tell him you have changed your plans. When he screams, "But
you promised!", explain to him that it was a campaign promise.</p>

<p>Every now and then, without warning, slap your child. Then
explain that this is defense. Tell him that you must be vigilant
at all times to stop any potential enemy before he gets big enough to hurt you.
This, too, your child will appreciate, not right at that moment, maybe, but
later in life.</p>

<p>At times your child will naturally express discontent with your
methods. He may even give voice to a petulant wish that he
lived with another family. To forestall and minimize this
reaction, tell him how lucky he is to be with you the most
loving and indulgent parent in the world, and recount lurid
stories of the cruelties of other parents. This will make him loyal to you and,
later, receptive to schoolroom claims that the America of the postmodern
welfare state is still the best and freest country on Earth.</p>

<p>This brings me to the most important child-rearing technique
of all: lying. Lie to your child constantly. Teach him that words mean nothing
- or rather that the meanings of words are continually "evolving", and
may be tomorrow the opposite of what they are today.</p>

<p>Some readers may object that this is a poor way to raise a
child. A few may even call it child abuse. But that's the whole point: Child
abuse is the best preparation for adult life under our form of GOVERNMENT.</p>

<title>The War Inevitable</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>The War Inevitable, March 1775, by Patrick Henry</h1>

<p>They tell us, Sir, that we are weak---unable to cope with so
formidable an adversary.  But when shall we be stronger?  Will
it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are
totally disarmed, and when a <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/UK/">British</a> guard shall be stationed
in every house?  Shall we gather strength by irresolution and
inaction?  Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance
by lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the delusive phantom
of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and
foot? Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper use of
those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power.</p>

<p> Three millions of People, armed in the holy cause of
liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess,
are invincible by any force which our enemy can send
against us. Beside, Sir, we shall not fight our battles alone.
There is a just God who presides over the destinies of
Nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles
for us.  The battle, Sir, is not to the strong alone. It is to
the vigilant, the active, the brave.  Besides, Sir, we have
no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now
too late to retire from the contest.  There is no retreat but
in submission and slavery!  Our chains are forged! Their
clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war
is inevitable. and let it come! I repeat, Sir, let it come!</p>

<p>      It is in vain, Sir, to extenuate the matter.  Gentlemen
may cry, Peace, Peace!---but there is no peace. The war
is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the
North will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms!
Our breathren are already in the field! Why stand we here
idle? What is it that Gentlemen wish? What would they
have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased
at the price of chains and slavery! Forbid it, Almighty
God! I know not what course others may take; but as for
me, give me liberty or give me death!</p>

<title>Market Process Theory</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Market Process Theory</h1>

<p>This overview of the Austrian school of economics' theory of
entrepreneurship was originally a college paper by
<a href="/revolution/by_name/G/KenGaillotJr.html">Ken Gaillot</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>The study of economics is based on the premise that there exists
a regularity in economic phenomena, laws as inescapable as the law
of gravity. Economic theory seeks to establish these laws. One
essential aspect of economic theory, the theory of the market, tries
to explain the relationships observed under a system of private
property. Although most economists today follow an equilibrium approach
to market theory, the body of market theory associated with the Austrian
school provides a better understanding of market processes, being
able to explain events that equilibrium analysis cannot.</p>

<p>The Austrian theory of the market is one of market process, of
action, change and uncertainty. Exponents of Austrian economics,
also called subjectivist economics, explain economic activity in
terms of its ultimate cause, purposeful human action. Austrians
believe an economic theory is valid for situations in which its
assumptions are present, if the theory is logically consistent.</p>

<p>Conventional neoclassical equilibrium analysis takes a fundamentally
different approach. Reality is to be modeled, as it is in the natural
sciences, tested against empirical data, and refined if necessary.
Models make assumptions to simplify reality and focus on areas of
interest. An economic theory is valid for reality if the results it
predicts are present in the situation and the theory is logically
consistent.</p>

<title>Militias React to Bombing</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: April 19, 1995 - May 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Militias React to Bombing</h1>

<p>Ambrose Evans-Pritchard's "Inside the underground world of America's secret
militias" in the May 1, 1995 <cite>Electronic Telegraph</cite> reported some
militia members' reactions to the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a> <A
href="index.html">federal building bombing</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Some units are semi-clandestine; others are totally secret, adopting the
cell structure of a proto-resistance force. ... I was given a glimpse of this
hidden world last week in
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ar/">Arkansas</a>
when a source offered to take me "inside"
the local underground. My guide - a former police officer - took elaborate
precautions.</p>
   
<p>... A man in a grey business suit invited me into his office. He explained
that he had once held top security clearance, working for the US military in
electronic countermeasures at Nato installations in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe</a>. ... Four members of
his group are serving officers in the US Air Force, he said, and another two
are deputy sheriffs in county law enforcement. He claimed that his group has
access to the secrets of the US government's security apparatus.</p>
   
<p>There are plenty of other militia units in the state ... The most visible
group is the Central Arkansas Regional Militia, commanded by a retired Marine
Corps major named Drew Raines.</p>
   
<p>... Ross Hullett, commander of the Oklahoma brigade, is part Cherokee Indian
and a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured
People. In Oklahoma, he claims, there are 20 militia members underground for
every one in the open.</p>
   
<p>"He's right," said a member of a clandestine unit that covers north <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a>
and southern Oklahoma. "There are four or five different groups in the shadows
around here and we're talking about dangerous people. I mean savage, vicious
people. I am one of them."</p>
   
<p>Behind it all, he says, is immense bitterness and pent-up anger over the
Vietnam war: "Who are the people running this government? Aren't they the ones
who dodged the draft and hid out in graduate school? Aren't they the ones who
sent out the poor white trash to do their dirty work - and then pissed on
them?"</p>
   
<p>... "Our government has been lying to us for too long, and Waco was the last
damned straw," said the Texan, a veteran of US Special Forces. "Now we're
telling them that they'd better straighten out this government and they had
better straighten out Waco because, if they don't, it is going to get ugly ...
You think you've seen terror? You haven't seen shit yet."</p>

<h1>John Gilmore</h1>

<p>John Gilmore, co-founder of the
<a href="/revolution/by_name/E/EFF.html">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>,
is an activist for online freedoms.</p>

<p>He has an extensive technical background in Internet technologies.
He was one of the first employees at Sun Microsystems and has worked
on many fundamental hardware and software technologies. In addition
to EFF, he co-founded the "alt" hierarchy of Usenet news, a successful
Internet service provider, the cypherpunks cryptography group, and
a company that made money supporting free software.</p>

<p>Through EFF, he has worked for freedom of online expression, fighting
cryptography restrictions and censorship. In 1996, while seeking nomination
as a trustee of the Internet Society, he said, "EFF's policy on cryptography
is pretty much solely my doing. Our stance on censorship and on using
market mechanisms rather than regulation is also something I'm proud of."</p>

<title>Oklahoma City -- Two Bombs?</title>

<h1>How Many Bombs in Oklahoma City?</h1>

<p>After a <a href="index.html">bomb</a> destroyed the Alfred Murrah Federal
Building in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ok/OklahomaCity.html">Oklahoma
City</a>,
many people speculated on who "really" was responsible.</p>

<p>Among the postulates pointing to alleged government involvement was one that
there were actually two bombs, not one, and that the second bomb was located
inside the Federal Building. Evidence to support this view includes a
seismogram recorded by the University of Oklahoma, and the pattern of the
bomb's effects.</p>

<title>Clinton on Being Libertarian</title>
<!-- Place: unknown -->
<!-- Time: unknown -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Bill Clinton: "Almost a Libertarian?"</h1>

<p><b>Q.</b> Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and lesbian
representatives came
out of a meeting with you and expressed  in the most ringing terms, their
confidence in your understanding of  them and their political aspirations, and
their belief that you would  fulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that
you will be able to meet their now enhanced expectations?</p>

<p><b>THE PRESIDENT:</b>  ... I believe that this country's policies should
be heavily
biased in favor of nondiscrimination. I believe when you tell people they can't
do certain things in this country that other people can do, there ought to be
an overwhelming and compelling reason for it. ...</p>

<p>... When I was Governor, I was attacked from the other direction for
sticking up for the rights of religious fundamentalists to run their child care
centers and to practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards. I just
have always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect the
rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest of their
capacities, and I'm going to stick right with that.</p>

<title>Dual-Use Investments</title>
<!-- Place: USA -->
<!-- Time: 1900's -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Dual-Use Investments</h1>

<p>From Greg Aharonian of the Internet Patent News Service:</p>

<p>There is a lot of talk in government and industry circles about dual-use
investments by various government agencies, direct investments/subsidies by
government agencies, and in general having the government act as a venture
capitalist.  In particular, much attention is focused on the Department of
Defense, which has been involved in such activities for decades.</p>

<p>Missing from all of these discussions is any critical analysis of the
ability of our government, or any government, to outperform the marketplace
(venture capitalists, stock markets, etc) in investing in profitable and
sustainable technologies.  Unfortunately there is little comprehensive data
to analyze these activities, and few intimately familiar both with government
activities and the operations of the marketplace (and independent of both).</p>

<p>Two studies I have come across conclude that much dual-use investment has
little effect on the general US economy, and suggest that maybe it would be
better for the government to influence such activities through lower tax rates
(or specialized tax incentives), instead of taxing and then redistributing the
money.</p>

<p>The first study appeared in the journal <cite>Scientometrics</cite> in an
article titled "The Impact of Warfare on the Rate of Invention: A Time Series
Analysis of United States Patent Activity" (Vol 3, No. 6, 437-455, 1981),
with the following abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The outbreak of war is generally thought to shift the fields
in which research is conducted.  As a result, military conflict
has historically been credited with being the catalyst which has
caused decisive technological advances.  It is also generally
suggested that warfare has a systematic impact on the intensity
of inventive activity.  Most scholars have claimed that wars
increase inventiveness, although a few argue that conflict is a
hindrance to research.  This question has not received extensive
empirical examination.</p>

<p>Using United States data, we show that a basic pattern is
repeatedly observed.  Immediately after the outbreak of a war,
there is a significant decline in inventiveness, which is followed
by a marked surge.  The average net result is a virtual negation
of the two trends.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second study appeared in the journal <cite>IEEE Transactions on
Engineering Management</cite>, Volume 40, Number 2, May 1993, in an article
titled "Defense R&D, Technology and Economic Performance: A Longitudinal
Analysis of the U.S.  Experience", with the following abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This paper examines the issue of the impact of defense expenditure
from a different perspective, i.e., in terms of the direct
relationships between defense R&D and economic performace as well
as the indirect relationships via the development of (1) technical
and scientific skills and (2) new technology.  The model was
estimated for the period 1955-1988 on a time-series set measured
as elasticities.  The effect of defense R&D is observed particularly
through technological change as measured by the number of patents
granted to U.S. organizations and individuals.  There is no
statistically significant evidence of resource diversion or
"crowding effect" on the civilian economy due to defense R&D.</p>

<p>Similarly, there does not seem to be any statistically visible
evidence of direct effect from defense R&D to the economy. 
Interestingly, the non-R&D aspect of defense spending appears to
have no statistically significant effect on the major components
of civilian economic performance, technical skills formation or
technological change.  From a policy point of view, this suggests
that technical spillovers may be limited to a specific kind of
defense spending and not to defense spending in general.  Another
interesting implication is the rivalry between R&D and non-R&D
defense spending in favor of the latter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These articles suggest that at the gross macroeconomic level, explicit
government effects on business formation through technology investment, as
measured by invention rates reflected in patent data, are marginal at best.
Not to say that the research and development funds that the government tries
to invest don't lead to significant new discoveries (I'm thinking of the many
academic discoveries done by people on NSF funding for example), or that
government purchases don't help new technologies (the microprocessor for
example), but rather that explicit efforts (such as those war related as
above) to achieve such results probably have little effect.</p>

<title>Rodgers' Testimony</title>
<!-- Place: Washington, DC (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1994? -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>T.J. Rodgers' Congressional Testimony</h1>

<p>T.J. Rodgers, President and CEO of Cypress Semiconductor, testified
against Bill Clinton's high-technology policy before the U.S. House
House Committee on Science, Space and Technology.</p>

As reported by <cite>First!</cite>, Rodgers challenged government intervention
on behalf of science and wanted to dispel the myth that high-technology
leaders stand uniformly behind Clinton's policies.</p>

<p>Rodgers told the Subcommittee:  "The administration
would have us believe that the business leaders of Silicon Valley stand
unanimously behind its program.  The image of John Scully, CEO of Apple
Computer, sitting beside the First Lady and applauding the State of the
Union address has been beamed far and wide by White House political
operatives.</p>

<p>"I am here today in strong opposition to the administration's economic
program in general and its technology agenda in particular.  I am not
alone."</p>

<p>Rodgers' own company is the highly successful Cypress Semiconductor,
maker of the SPARC microchip series. Rodgers testified that Cypress
generated more than $1 billion in cumulative revenue, $160 million in
profits (of which $60 million was paid in taxes), 1,500 jobs, and paid
cumulative salaries of nearly $500 million (of which employees paid taxes of
nearly $150 million).</p>

<p>"If that is an `excess of the 1980s' let's have more," Rodgers said.  "As
an entrepreneur, I should not have to apologize for my success and that of
the company.  I am offended by the administration's divisive rhetoric.</p>

<p>"As we debate the virtues of raising taxes on individuals and
corporations, let's not debate abstractions.  Let's debate the realities of
who pays and the impact of raising taxes on those people and companies."</p>

<p>Rodgers also presented written comments from other technology leaders:<p>

<ul>
<li><p>Joe Zemke, chief executive officer, Amdahl Corp. -- "Whether it is
sugar subsidies or `investments' in high performance computing, the Clinton
program represents the same logic:  siphoning dollars from individuals and
corporations and allocating them through a process that is terribly
inefficient -- a process that is responsive not to market requirements, but
to bureaucratic empires and political payoffs."</p></li>

<li><p>Don Valentine, founding venture capitalist and director, Apple
Computer; director, Cisco Systems -- "Don't assume that the Pepsi-Cola kid
(John Scully) speaks for Silicon Valley.  We do not need pretenders who
speak for us.  We have visionaries who are rare, important and doers."</p></li>

<li><p>Finis Conner, founder and chief executive officer, Conner Peripherals -
- "The development of all technologies and products involves risks and
rewards.  The government should not be in the business of speculating with
taxpayers' money on which of those risks will be winners and which will be
losers."</p></li>

<li><p>Scott McNealy, chief executive officer, Sun Microsystems -- "In the
current economic climate, the proposed increase in the corporate tax rate
does not encourage job growth, business investment, or global
competitiveness.  Rather, it penalizes profits and will result in further
loss of jobs."</p></li>

</ul>

<p><cite>First!</cite> reported that Ridgers also cited Gil Amelio, chief
executive officer, National Semiconductor; Wilf Corrigan,
chief executive officer, LSI Logic; Pierre Lamond, founder, National
Semiconductor; L.J. Sevin, chairman, Cyrix; John Adler, chief executive
officer, Adaptec; and Roger Emerick, chief executive officer, Lam Research.</p>

<p>Rodgers criticized Clinton's belief that government would do a good job
picking winners in the marketplace: "Essentially, the administration is
arguing that by taking my money in the form of higher taxes and `investing'
it in subsidies, it can make better investments -- create more jobs and
wealth -- than the venture-capital firms with which I invest -- firms that
are the envy of <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/Japan/">Japan</a> and <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Europe/">Europe</a>. That logic
defies common sense."</p>

<p>Rodgers said that what government needs to do is get out of the way:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"The regional Bell operating companies would gladly hook fiber optics
from the long-haul network to the home.  But they are prevented from doing
so by regulations that make the huge capital investments
uneconomical."</p></li>

<li><p>"Cable operators are already hooked into 60 percent of American homes.
They too could make the connection with existing long-haul data
superhighways, but they are prevented by regulations that declare them a
`natural monopoly' and restrict them to television and movie
business."</p></li>

<li><p>"The long-haul superhighway could be hooked into the home through
wireless circuits.  But the frequencies required are currently being held up
by the Federal Communications Commission."</p></li>

<li><p>"The opportunities for [budget] cuts go way beyond headcount," Rodgers
said. "We could spend hours listing wasteful and unnecessary programs --
programs that made sense 30 or 40 years ago, when they were created, but
that make no sense today."</p></li>

</ul>

<p>A copy of T.J. Rodgers' testimony is available from Ben Gibson (call
408/287-1700).</p>

<h1>Linda Thompson</h1>

<p>Dr. Linda Thompson is an Internet character who has been prominent in the
militia and Waco movements.</p>

<p>Thompson issued the "Thompson Ultimatum" demanding that Congress repeal the
twentieth century, and parts of the nineteenth, and calling for militia
enforcement of the ultimatum. She later claimed that the ultimatum was simply
to stir controversy and get people to offer better alternatives.</p>

<p>Thompson's theory about the Waco fire is that it was started by a
flamethrower tank. This idea was discredited, and now government apologists
use it as a straw man to avoid discussing real evidence of government
wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Thompson is sarcasm-impaired, and has threatened to sue me for libel
based on the above "defamatory and false" paragraphs. She also believes
federal agents have planned to assassinate her.</p>

<title>Ballot Access in New Hampshire</title>
<!-- Place: New Hampshire (USA) -->
<!-- Time: 1992?3?4? -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Ballot Access in <a
href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/nh/">New Hampshire</a></h1>

<p>Four Libertarians were elected to the New Hampshire State House in 1992, a
record showing for the party. Part of their success was due to New Hampshire's
long-standing tradition of multiple party nominations. A candidate can be
nominated by more than one party, and appears on the ballot under each party's
label.</p>

<p>Three of the Libertarians were cross-nominated by the Republican Party and
one by the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>In response to Libertarian success, the New Hampshire legislature raised the
hurdles for third parties. Instead of listing multiply-nominated candidates
under each party heading, each such candidate appears only under the
candidate's party, with a small-print mention of cross-nominations under that
column.</p>

<title>The Weak Case for Public Schooling</title>
<!-- Author: David Friedman, July 7, 1993 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1 align=center>The Weak Case for Public
Schooling<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></h1>
<p>by <a href="/revolution/by_name/F/DavidFriedman.html">David Friedman</a></p>

<p>It is often said that Adam Smith, despite his general belief in
Laissez-faire, made an exception for education. That is not entirely true.
In the course of a lengthy and interesting discussion, Smith argues both
that education is a legitimate government function, at least in some societies,
and that it is a function which governments perform very badly. His conclusion
is that while it is legitimate for government to subsidize education,
it may be more prudent to leave education entirely
private.<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

<p>My purpose in this essay is to argue that Smith's conjecture was correct
While government schooling,<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> free and compulsory, is at present
nearly universal in developed societies, the case for it is unconvincing.
There are arguments for government provision of schooling, as there are
arguments for government provision of any good or service, but the arguments
in favor are weaker, and the arguments against stronger, than the
corresponding arguments for other goods and services that we routinely
leave to the private market.</p>

<hr>
<h2>The Arguments In Favor of Government Schooling</h2>

<p>The arguments in favor of government involvement in schooling can be
roughly divided into four groups: Externality arguments, information
arguments, capital market failure arguments, and egalitarian arguments.
I will deal with them in that order.</p>

<ul>
<li><A href="externality.html">Externality Arguments</a></li>
<li><A href="information.html">Information Arguments</a></li>

<p><a name="fn1">1.</a> This article is dedicated to E. G. West, to whom,
allowing for the usual timelag between ideas and policy, our grandchildren
will owe a large debt. Most of my historical discussion is based on
E. G. West,
<a href="/revolution/community/educate/books/west.html"><cite>Education and
the Industrial Revolution</cite></a>,
P.T. Batesford & Co., London 1975.</p>

<p><a name="fn2">2.</a> "The expence of the institutions for education
and religious instruction, is likewise, no doubt, beneficial to the whole
society, and may, therefore, without injustice, be defrayed by the general
contribution of the whole society. This expence, however, might perhaps
with equal propriety, and even with some advantage, be defrayed altogether
by those who receive the immediate benefit of such education and instruction,
or by the voluntary contribution of those who think they have occasion for
either the one or the other." (Adam Smith, <cite>An Inquiry into the Nature and
Causes of the Wealth of Nations</cite>, 1789 edition, E. Cannan ed., 1904
U of Chicago Press,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/il/Chicago.html">Chicago</a>:
1976, Bk V, Ch 1, Conclusion, p. ii 340).</p>

<p><a name="fn3">3.</a> I have chosen to refer to "government" rather
than "public" schools and schooling, because I find the latter terminology
misleading. A privately run school may be "public" in the sense that
differentiates a public hotel or restaurant from a private club -- it may
choose to accept all customers willing to pay its price. In this sense, most
government run schools are private, since they accept only students who meet
certain criteria, most commonly geographical. To describe government schools
as "public" on the grounds that they are run by the public is to identify the
public with the state, which I think is a mistake. Avoiding the term
"public school" also avoids confusion between the British and American
usages; a British "public school" is what Americans call a "private school."
I use "government" rather than "state" in the context of schooling in order
to avoid confusion with "state" in the sense of a political subdivision
of a federal system, such as the state of

<h1>Quotes on Freedom</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Liberty vs. Safety</h2>

<p>They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety,
deserve neither liberty nor safety.</p>

<p>- Benjamin Franklin, 1759.</p>

<hr>

<h2>U.N. View of Rights</h2>

<p>These rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the
purposes and principles of the United Nations.</p>

<p>- UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 29(3).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Churchill on Fighting for Rights</h2>

<p>Still if you will not fight for the right when you can easily win without
bloodshed, if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and not so
costly, you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the
odds against you and only a precarious chance for survival. There may be a
worse case. You may have to fight when there is no chance of victory,
because it is better to perish than to live as slaves.</p>

<p> - Winston Churchill.</p>

<h1>Clinton Administration E-mail Directory</h1>

<p>The following Clinton Administration e-mail addresses were obtained from a
November 2, 1994 memorandum distributed on the Libernet mailing list. This list
is not guaranteed to be correct. In fact I suspect the system administrator
would have changed most or all of these addresses after they became
publicized.</p>

<p>Of particular interest are Ira Magaziner (<img src="/images/mail.gif"

<title>Bad News for Moses</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Bad News for Moses</h1>

<p>It seems that Moses is sitting in the Egyptian ghetto, things are going
terrible: the Pharoah won't even talk to him, the rest of the Hebrews are mad
at him for making the overseers even more irritable than usual, etc.  He's
about ready to give up.</p>

<p>Suddenly a booming, sonorous voice speaks from above: <strong>"You, Moses, heed
me. I have good news, and bad news."</strong></p>

<p> Moses is staggered. The voice continues:</p>

<p> <strong>"You, Moses, will lead the people of Israel from bondage. If the
Pharoah refuses to release your bonds I will smite Egypt with a rain of
frogs.</p>

<p> "You, Moses will lead the people of Israel to the Promised Land. If the Pharoah
blocks your way I will smite Egypt with a plague of locusts.</p>

<p> "You, Moses, will lead the people to freedom and safety. If the Pharoah's army
pursues you, I will part the waters of the Red Sea to open your path to the
Promised Land."</strong></p>

<p> Moses is stunned.  "That's, that's fantastic, I can't believe it!" he stammers,
"but what's the bad news?"</p>

<p> <strong>"You, Moses, must write the environmental impact
statement."</strong></p>

<title>Bill Clinton on Freedom</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2>Bill Clinton on Why We Don't Really Want Freedom</h2>

<p>... a lot of the <a
href="/revolution/by_place/Asia/">Asian</a> societies that are doing very
well now have low
crime rates and high economic growth rates, partly because they have very
coherent societies with strong units where the unit is more important than
the individual, whether it's the family unit or the work unit or the
community unit.</p>

<p>My own view is that you can go to the extreme in either direction. And when
we got organized as a country and we wrote a fairly radical Constitution
with a radical Bill of Rights, giving a radical amount of individual
freedom to Americans, it was assumed that the Americans who had that
freedom would used it responsibly. That is, when we set up this country,
abuse of people by government was a big problem. So if you read the
Constitution, it's rooted in the desire to limit the ability of government's
ability to mess with you, because that was a huge problem. It can still be
a huge problem. But it assumed that people would basically be raised in
coherent families, in coherent communities, and they would work for the
common good, as well as for the individual welfare.</p>

<p>What's happened in America today is, too many people live in areas where
there's no family structure, no community structure, and no work structure.
And so there's a lot of irresponsibility. And so a lot of people say
there's too much personal freedom. When personal freedom's being abused,
you have to move to limit it. That's what we did in the announcement I
made last weekend on the public housing projects, about how we're going to
have weapon sweeps and more things like that to try to make people safer
in their communities. So that's my answer to you. We can have -- the
more personal freedom a society has, the more personal responsibility a
society needs, and the more strength you need out of your institutions --
family, community and work.</p>

<p>-- Bill Clinton, President of the United States, on MTV's "Enough Is
Enough."</p>

<title>Motherfuckers in Congress</title>
<!-- Place: USA/cyberspace -->
<!-- Time: February 8, 1996 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>American Reporter's Challenge to Censorship</h1>

<p>The following is the full text of the article written by
the American Reporter to challenge the censorship provisions of
the U.S. Telecommunications Act.</p>

<hr>

<h2>THE X-ON CONGRESS:  INDECENT COMMENT ON AN INDECENT SUBJECT</h2>

<p>by  Steve Russell<br>
American Reporter Correspondent</p>

<p><a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/SanAntonio.html">SAN
ANTONIO</a>,
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/tx/">Texas</a> -- You
motherfuckers in Congress have dropped over the edge of the earth this
time.  I understand that very few of the swarm of
 high dollar lobbyists around the Telecommunications Bill had any interest
 in content regulation -- they were just trying to get their clients an
 opportunity to dip their buckets in the money stream that cyberspace may
 become -- but the public interest sometimes needs a little attention.
 Keeping your eyes on what big money wants, you have sold out the First
 Amendment.</p>

<p> First, some basics.  If your children walked by a public park and heard
 some angry sumbitches referring to Congress as "the sorriest bunch of
 cocksuckers ever to sell out the First Amendment" or suggesting that
 "the only reason to run for Congress these days is to suck the lobbyists'
 dicks and fuck the people who sent you there," no law would be violated
 (assuming no violation of noise ordinances or incitement to breach the
 peace).  If your children did not wish to hear that language, they could
 only walk away.  Thanks to your heads-up-your-ass dereliction of duty,
 if they read the same words in cyberspace, they could call the FBI!</p>

 <p>Cyberspace is the village green for the whole world. It is the same as the
 village green our Founders knew as the place to rouse the rabble who became
 Americans, but it is also different.  Your blind acceptance of the dubious --
 make that dogass dumb -- idea that children are harmed by hearing so-called
 dirty words has created some pretty stupid regulations without shutting down
 public debate, but those stupid regulations will not import to cyberspace
 without consequences that even the public relations whores in Congress
 should find unacceptable.</p>

 <p>In cyberspace, there is no time.  A posted message stays posted until it is
 wiped.  Therefore, there is no way to indulge the fiction that children do
 not stay up late or cannot program a VCR.  In cyberspace, there is no place.
 The "community standards" are those of the whole world.  An upload from
 Amsterdam can become a download in Idaho.  By trying to regulate obscenity
 and indecency on the Internet, you have reduced the level of expression
 allowed consenting adults to that of the most anal retentive blueballed
 fuckhead U.S. attorney in the country. The Internet is everywhere you can
 plug in a modem.  Call Senator Exon an "ignorant motherfucker" in Lincoln,
 <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ne/">Nebraska</a> and find
 yourself prosecuted in Bibleburg,
 <a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ms/">Mississippi</a>.</p>

 <p>In cyberspace, you cannot require the convenience store to sell Hustler in
 a white sleeve.  The functional equivalent is gatekeeper software, to which
 no civil libertarian has voiced any objection. Gatekeeper software cannot be
 made foolproof, but can you pandering pissants not see that any kid smart
 enough to hack into a Website is also smart enough to get his hands on a
 hard copy of Hustler if he really wants one?</p>

 <p>In cyberspace, there is the illusion of anonymity but no real privacy.
 It is theoretically possible for any Internet server to seine through all
 messages for key words (although it seems likely the resulting slowdown
 would be noticeable).  Perhaps some of you read about America On Line's
 attempt to keep children from reading the word "breast?"  An apparently
 unforeseen consequence was the shutdown of a discussion group of breast
 cancer survivors.  Don't you think more kids are aware of "teat"
 (pronounced "tit") than of "breast?"  Can skirts on piano legs, er, limbs
 be far behind?</p>

 <p>But silly shit like this is just a pimple on the ass of the long-term
 consequences for politics, art and education.  You have passed a law that
 will get less respect than the 55 m.p.h. speed limit dead bang in the middle
 of the First Amendment.  Indecency is nothing but a matter of fashion;
 obscenity is the same but on a longer timeline.  This generation freely
 reads James Joyce and Henry Miller and the Republic still stands.
 The home of the late alleged pornographer D. H. Lawrence is now a beautiful
 writers' retreat in the mountains above Taos, managed by the University of
 New Mexico.</p>

 <p>Universities all have Internet servers, and every English Department has at
 least one scholar who can read Chaucer's English -- but not on the Internet
 anymore.  Comparative literature classes might read Boccaccio -- but not on
 the Internet anymore.  What if some U. S. Attorney  hears about Othello and
 Desdemona "making the beast with two backs" -- is interracial sex no longer
 indecent anywhere in the country, or is Shakespeare off the Internet?</p>

 <p>Did you know you can download video and sound from the Internet?
 Yes, that means you can watch other people having sex if that is interesting
 to you, live or on tape.  Technology can make such things hard to retrieve,
 but probably not impossible.  And since you have swept right past obscenity
 and into indecency, the baby boomers had better keep their old rock 'n roll
 tapes off the Internet.</p>

 <p>When the Jefferson Airplane sang "her heels rise for me," they were not
 referring to a dance step.  And if some Brit explains the line about
 "finger pie" in Penny Lane, the Beatles will be gone.  All of those school
 boards that used to ban "The Catcher in the Rye" over cussing and spreading
 the foul lie that kids masturbate can now go to federal court and get that
 nasty book kept out of cyberspace.</p>

 <p>But enough about the past.  What about rap music?  No, I do not care much
 for it either -- any more than I care for the language you shitheads have
 forced me to use in this essay -- but can you not see the immediate
 differential impact of this law by class and race?  What is your defense -
 -that there are no African-Americans on the Internet, since they are too
 busy pimping and dealing crack?  If our educational establishment has any
 sense at all, they will be trying to see more teens of all colors on the
 Internet, because there is a lot to be learned in cyberspace that has
 nothing to do with sex.</p>

 <p>There are plenty of young people in this country who have legitimate
 political complaints.  When you dickheads get done with
 <a href="/revolution/community/welfare/ss/">Social Security</a>,
 they will be lucky if the retirement age is still in double digits.
 But thanks to the wonderful job the public schools have done keeping sex
 and violence out, we have a lot of intelligent kids who cannot express
 themselves without indecent language. I have watched lawyers in open court
 digging their young clients in the ribs every time the word "fuck" slipped
 out.</p>

 <p>Let's talk about this fucking indecent language bullshit.  Joe Shea, my
 editor, does not want it in his newspaper, and I respect that position.
 He might even be almost as upset about publishing this as I am about
 writing it. I do use salty language in my writing, but sparingly, only
 as a big hammer.  Use the fucking shit too fucking much and it loses its
 fucking impact --see what I mean?  Fiction follows different rules, and if
 you confine your fiction writing to how the swell people want to see
 themselves using language, you not only preclude literary depiction of
 most people but you are probably false to the people you purport to depict.</p>

 <p>Do you remember how real language used by real people got on the air and in
 the newspapers?  Richard Nixon, while he was president, speaking in the
 White House about official matters.  A law professor and a nominee for
 Supreme Court Justice arguing about pubic hairs and porno movies during
 Senate hearings. Are these matters now too indecent for the Internet?
 How much cleansing will be required of the online news services?
 Answer: Enough cleansing to meet the standard of what is appropriate
 for a child in the most restrictive federal judicial district.</p>

 <p>This is bullshit -- unconstitutional bullshit and also bad policy bullshit.
 To violate your ban on indecency, I have been forced to use and overuse
 so-called indecent language.  But if I called you a bunch of goddam
 motherfucking cocksucking cunt-eating blue-balled bastards with the morals
 of muggers and the intelligence of pond scum, that would be nothing compared
 to this indictment, to wit: you have sold the First Amendment,
 your birthright and that of your children.  The Founders turn in their
 graves.  You have spit on the grave of every warrior who fought under the
 Stars and Stripes.</p>

 <p>And what mess of pottage have you acquired in exchange for the rights of a
 free people?  Have you cleansed the Internet of even the rawest pornography?
 No, because it is a worldwide system.  You have, however, handed the
 government a powerful new tool to harass its critics: a prosecution for
 indecent commentary in any district in the country.</p>

 <p>Have you protected one child from reading dirty words?  Probably not, if you
 understand what the economists call "substitution" -- but you have leveled
 the standards of political debate to a point where a history buff would not
 dare to upload some of the Federalist v. Anti-Federalist election rhetoric
 to a Website.</p>

 <p>Since the lobby reporting requirements were not law when the censorship
 discussion was happening, I hope you got some substantial reward for what
 you gave up.  Thirty pieces of silver doesn't go far these days.</p>

<title>Tobacco, The Feds and You</title>

<h1>Tobacco, The Feds and You</h1>

<p>Smoking is bad for you. We all know that. Few things are as ingrained
in our collective mind as the idea that smoking is a deadly addiction
which ought to be discouraged and punished with extra taxes, age
restrictions, public bans and other such regulations. Life neatly divides
into good guys and bad guys, the good guys being the Surgeon General and his
government cohorts, and the bad guys being those nasty tobacco companies
who sneak up behind people and shove lit cigarettes into their mouths.</p>

<p>Is the real world ever so clearcut? Smoking is a personal habit with
some health risks and some pleasurable benefits. The last thing we need is
more government involvement in our personal choices.</p>

<hr>

<p>"If I cannot smoke cigars in Heaven, I shall not go." So said
Mark Twain, acknowledging that smoking just might be bad for you.</p>

<p>Numerous medical studies over the past century have conclusively shown
the link between tobacco smoking and various diseases, particularly lung
cancer.  Overall, a cigarette smoker has about ten times the risk of
lung cancer as a nonsmoker. Cigar and pipe smokers have only three times
the risk.  And moderate cigar and pipe smokers -- those who smoke no more
than two cigars or pipe bowls per day -- have no significant difference in
risk from nonsmokers.</p>

<p>Smoking a premium cigar is less hazardous than smoking cigarettes for several
reasons. Premium cigars are made with no additives, unlike cigarettes
with hundreds, and cigars' fermentation process results in lower tar
and nicotine. Most cigar and pipe smokers don't inhale the smoke deeply,
while cigarette smokers typically do. Cigar smokers often start smoking
later in life.</p>

<p>Does this mean that cigar and pipe smoking is harmless? Of course not. Heavy
smoking of tobacco in any form raises your risk of several diseases
tremendously. Alcohol and even caffeine use compound the risk. But
smoking is not an inevitable killer, and the stress from worrying
about moderate smoking is more dangerous than the smoking itself.</p>

<hr>

<p>"E = mc2", Albert Einstein said, but he also said, "Pipe smoking contributes
to a somewhat calm and objective judgment in all human affairs." Old
Albert was referring to something the surgeon general shudders to
think of -- the benefits of smoking.</p>

<p>Contrary to government warning labels, smoking is not all danger
and no benefit. Smokers report various pleasurable
aspects of smoking -- mental alertness, general ease, reduced stress.</p>

<p>Very little in life is pure cost or pure benefit. Virtually every
choice we make is a trade-off between what we gain and what we give up.
Who other than yourself is qualified to decide for you whether the benefits
outweigh the costs?</p>

<hr>

<p>Al Haig used to say when he smoked a Cuban cigar, "I'm not violating
the embargo, I'm destroying communist resources."</p>

<p>The American spirit can be summed up as "Don't Tread on Me."
Today, various busybodies are treading on us in countless ways. Our
liberties have suffered the death of a thousand cuts -- we lose a little
bit here, a little bit there. Health Puritans have played their role
in this, with regulations, limitations, strangulations, trying desperately
to condemn us to a long life of no fun.</p>

<p>We have sin taxes on tobacco products. We have an embargo against Cuba
including its world-renowned cigars. We have age restrictions, advertising
bans and countless other pages of federal, state and local regulations
of tobacco use.</p>

<p>It's time for all of us to say to the government, "Butt out!" We support
free trade -- end the pointless embargo against Cuba. We don't want
the likes of Bill Clinton or Bob Dole determining our values --
families and communities can do a much better job of dealing with
teenage smoking. Our right to free speech is absolute and intertwined
with everyone else's -- repeal restrictions against advertising.</p>

<p>Smoking is now more than just a habit. It is an act of rebellion against
the trend towards nanny-government. When you sit out on the porch, savor
the smoke of a fine cigar, and discuss life with some friends,
you're saying to the world, America's still a free country.
Give me your advice, but keep your hands to yourself. I will choose
whether my house and my business are smoke-free or smoke-friendly.</p>

<hr>

<p>Smoking is smelly and unhealthy. We should be considerate of others in
all that we do, keeping in mind our company and our surroundings. At the
same time, moderate smoking is not harmful, can be quite pleasant,
and is a great way to annoy busybodies. We don't have to sig heil
to the health nazis. Government makes a terrible nanny. Whatever your
choice may be regarding smoking, let's make sure it remains just
that -- your choice.</p>

<title>Term Limits and Ballot Access</title>
<!-- Place: USA; Arkansas (USA) -->
<!-- Time: decision May 22, 1995 -->
</head>

<body>

<h1>Term Limits Ruling May Affect Ballot Access</h1>

<p>On May 22, 1995 the Supreme Court struck down the "term limits"
amendment to the
<a href="/revolution/by_place/NorthAmerica/USA/ar/">Arkansas</a> state
constitution. The court's justification may
give third parties an opportunity to challenge state ballot access laws, at
least in regards to federal office.</p>

<p>The Arkansas amendment did not actually limit terms, but instead prevented
any candidate who had previously served three terms in the U.S. House or
two terms in the U.S. Senate from being listed on the ballot (they could still
be elected as write-ins). The fact that this is called "term limits" shows
just how powerful ballot access is.</p>

<p>In <cite>U.S. Term Limits Inc. et al. v. Thornton et al.</cite>, Docket
93-1456, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that Section 3 of Amendment 73 to the
Arkansas Constitution violates the Federal Constitution.</p>

<p>The Court held that States are prohibited from imposing additional
qualifications for holding federal office because the offices are inherent
to the Constitution, and thus not in the realm of the Tenth Amendment.</p>

<p>In the majority opinion, Justice Stevens said, "Permitting individual States
to formulate diverse qualifications for their representatives would result in
a patchwork of state qualifications, undermining the uniformity and the
national character that the Framers envisioned and sought to ensure."</p>

<p>This clearly targets the "patchwork" of state ballot access laws for
challenge on similar grounds.</p>

<p>The full text of this and other Supreme Court decisions is available at

<title>Benefits of Nicotine</title>
<!-- Place: -->

</head>

<body>

<h1>Benefits of Nicotine</h1>

<p>Tobacco has been thoroughly demonized by the health nazis who
supply the press and policy makers with doped information. Prohibitionists
have a unique color blindness to shades of gray -- every drug is
either absolutely "good" or "bad." Nicotine, of course, is bad.</p>

<p>In tobacco's case, prohibitionists and restrictionists have latched
onto scientific evidence that tobacco is addictive and cancer-causing.
They seize anything that might disparage the drug, and ignore anything
that suggests that some use may be harmless or even beneficial.</p>

<p>For years, scientists have been doing research that has found that
cigarette smokers have a <em>reduced</em> risk of certain diseases.
Nicotine may one day be studied to help find treatments for major
health problems like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, attention
deficit disorders, ulcerative colitis and Tourette's syndrome.</p>

<p>Nicotine attaches to certain receptors found on many types of cells,
and stimulates cell activity including the release of neurotransmitters,
including dopamine, acetylcholine and glutamate. This stimulation
reduces the risk of certain neurological diseases such as Parkinson's
by half. Research continues to find beneficial effects of nicotine,
such as interfering with plaque deposits that lead to Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<h2>The Legacy of Prohibitionism</h2>

<p>The prohibitionist mindset, which marks drugs as "good" or "bad,"
blinds people to the reality that all drugs have beneficial and
harmful uses. Dosage, frequency, genetics and numerous other factors
affect what effects a drug will have on a given individual.</p>

<p>The New York Times remarked that nicotine research "sounds a little
like scientific blasphemy" and that "efforts to stop smoking have
discouraged research into the possible benefits of nicotine."</p>

<hr>

<p>Source: January 14, 1997 New York Times News Service article "Can it be?
Researchers investigating possible benefits of nicotine," reprinted
in the <a href="/revolution/by_name/N/NandO.html">NandO Times</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="site">Site-specific Research</a></h3>
Coasts and land-margins in the Eastern North Pacific ocean
and worldwide have provided fertile ground for field 
laboratories, pilot projects, and duplication sites. Field laboratories 
are sites where research is conducted with a long-term  
(typically 5 or more years) integrated perspective, even if through a string 
of independently-funded projects:  
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="LCR">Lower Columbia River, OR-WA, USA</a><br>
<li><a href="slough/">Columbia Slough, OR, USA</a><br>
<li><!--a href="CSZ"-->Cascadia Subduction Zone<!--/a>-->
<li>Eastern North Pacific<br>
<li><a href="tillamook/publications/pba96.html">Tillamook Bay, OR, USA</a>
<li><a href="tejo">Tejo estuary, Portugal</a><br>
</ul>
<p>
Pilot project sites are those where research is conducted for a limited 
period of time, typically 1-3 years, often with the specific objective of
developing, enhancing, or assessing a particular approach or methodology:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Siletz Bay, OR, USA<br>
<li>
<a href="/benchmarks/friday-harbor/problem4/">Sea of Japan</a><br>
<li><a href="sfb">S. Francisco Bay, CA, USA</a><br>
</ul>
<p>
Duplication sites are those where research is conducted for a short 
period of time, using methodologies pioneered elesewhere, typically
with the objective of assessing the generality of such methodology:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Newport Bay, OR<br>
<li>Seaside, OR
</ul>

The Education Mission of the Center for 
Coastal and Land-Margin Research (CCALMR)
 is to transfer scientific knowledge on 
coasts and land-margins, in ways that 
support society's need to interact with these 
complex ecosystems.

<h3>Education Review</h3>
<p>
The Center for Coastal and Land-Margin Research (CCALMR) blends traditional 
and innovative approaches to education:<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#pms">PhD and MSc degrees</a><br>
<li><a href="#cow">Courses on the Web</a><br>
<li><a href="#sof">Software</a><br>
<li><a href="#sfs">Science for Society</a><br>
<li><a href="#merts">Marine and Environmental Research and Training 
Station</a><br>
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="pms">PhD and MSc Programs</a></h3>
Through the <a href="http://www.ese.ogi.edu/">Department of 
Environmental Science and Engineering</a>, CCALMR seamlessly
contributes to the PhD and MSc degrees in Environmental Science and 
Engineering offered by the Oregon Graduate Institute.  
<p>
CCALMR <a href="/students/">students</a> follow degree programs  that are 
intrinsically inter-disciplinnary, in both 
course contents and research opportunities. For further information,
refer to the departmental and institutional guidelines. For 
applications, refer to the institutional forms. You are welcome to
contact any of our faculty directly, for additional information.
However, decisions on admission require prior completion of 
the formal application process.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="cow">Courses on the Web</a></h3>
We expect that an increasingly large number of our courses will merge
traditional in-class teaching with off-class use of the World Wide Web.
<a href="/courses/ese500/ese500.html">ESE500</a> and
<a href="/courses/ese532/ese532.html">ESE532</a>
are experiments in this direction.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h3><a name="sof">Software</a></h3>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h3><a name="sfs">Science for Society</a></h3>
We advocate the need to transfer scientific knowledge to society, in ways that
enhance the role of science in sound decision-making on coasts and land-
margin resources. Non-traditional vehicles include popular press, agency and
community involvement in research projects, and popular World Wide Web pages. 
Experiments in these three areas are in progress.

<a name="obj"><h4>OBJECTIVES</h4>
<strong>Long-term:</strong> To enhance interdisciplinary, integrated understanding of 
oceanographic and 
environmental processes in estuaries and coastal regions, and to incorporate such understanding 
into diagnostic and predictive models, towards operational nowcast-forecast systems.
<p>
<strong>Short-term:</strong> (a) To enhance the observation and representation of 
selected hydrodynamic processes, 
with emphasis on density-driven turbulent flow and transport in tidal inlets, tidal propagation 
at coupled spatial scales, and longwave inundation. (b) To enhance the representation of geochemical 
and biogeochemical processes at sediment-water interfaces, under moderate shear. (c) To investigate 
software integration of field observations, laboratory experiments, and computer models.
<p>
<hr>
<h4>APPROACH</h4>
This will be an interdisciplinary effort, involving balanced components of numerical modeling, 
field observations, laboratory experiments, and software integration. While predictive capability 
is an ultimate goal, numerical modeling will at this time be viewed primarily as a powerful 
integrator and testing vehicle for conceptual understanding. Field observations will be focused on 
hydrodynamic processes, and will be based on both moored and roving instrumentation 
systematically deployed in the Columbia River estuary. Deployment design will be guided by a 
combination of forward and inverse modeling. Laboratory experiments will be conducted primarily in 
a 1-1.5m diameter rotating flume, with sediments and water column subject to controlled shear and 
ultimately controlled density structure. Telemetry and a network of conventional and innovative 
probes will be designed to maximize the amount of continuous (rather than time-sporadic) data on 
physical, geochemical, and biogeochemical properties. Emphasis will be placed on the measurement 
of concentrations of redox-active elements, and of net redox potential. Data interpretation 
and experimental and sampling design will be assisted by a combination of hydrodynamic and 
geochemical and biogeochemical transport models, conceived for application at both laboratory 
and field scales. Models results and field and laboratory data will be integrated through a 
coherent system of software and networking tools, partly based on the experience of the 
Agile/Harvest and REINAS projects.

<h2><em>Science for Society:</em></h2>
<h2>Impact of tsunamis on Oregon coastal communities</h2>
<br clear=right>
<hr>
Dedicated to John Paul van Son, an inquisitive young mind from Ilwaco, WA
<hr>
<DL>  
  <dt><strong>Background</strong></dt>
  <p>
<dd>Scientific findings of the last several years have shown that the Oregon coast is vulnerable to great (M 8-9) earthquakes that can occur on the offshore <a href="images/CSZ">Cascadia sudbuction zone (CSZ) fault system</a>.
CSZ earthquakes are rare events: the last has occurred about 300 years ago, and they are believed to occur every 200 to 600 years.
While rare, these events can be highly destructive. A major manifestation of CSZ earthquakes are tsunamis, large water waves generated by the seismic deformation of the sea floor. As these waves reach the coast, severe flooding can occur, resulting in loss of life and property.
<p>
Predicting the impact of tsunamis anywhere in the world is a process fraught with uncertainty. The rarety of CSZ tsunamis compounds the uncertainties, and has forced <a href="people">scientists</a> to blend computers, fundamental laws of physics, and information from prehistoric earthquakes and tsunamis in a fairly unique way. 
<p>
One of the outcomes are computer models that simulate the propagation of CSZ tsunamis. These models provide insight into what happened in the past and what might happen in the future, should a great subduction zone earthquake and tsunami strike the Pacific Northwest coast.  To partially account for uncertainties, several <a href="images/scenarios">scenarios of sea floor deformation</a> have been investigated.                            <p>

     </p>
</DL>
<hr>
<dt><strong>Current understanding and uncertainties</strong></dt>
<DL>
<dd>The characteristics of the tsunami wave, both offshore and along the coast, 
will depend primarily on the sea floor deformation. Predicting the exact 
characteristics of that deformation is beyond current scientific capabilities. 
<a href="images/scenarios/">Scenarios</a> of sea floor deformation that have been used in our 
research are based on and generally consistent with both geological information 
from prehistoric tsunamis and known seismic and geological caractheristics of 
the CSZ fault
system. However, it is unlikely that any of the scenarios will mimic 
exactly the characteristics of future events.
<p>
<dd> Most scenarios that can reasonably be constructed show the generation of two waves, one propagating towards the coast, 
and the other towards the deep ocean. The latter will cross the Pacific basin, 
and will eventually impact distant  coasts: Hawaii, Japan, etc. The former will 
reach in a matter of <a href="images/minutes">minutes</a> the  
coasts of Oregon, Washington, southern British Columbia, and northern 
California. 
<p>
<dd> <a href="images/maxwh">Maximum wave run-up heights</a> may reach close to 12m (~36ft) for some scenarios. Local impact will be stronger in certain regions of the coast than in 
others. For a given event, the offshore and nearshore coastal topography 
determine the regions where energy will concentrate. High waves will have 
only a serious impact, however, if the shoreline is low enough to be
susceptible of flooding.  
Communities that are particularly exposed in the Oregon coast include <a href="
anim">Seaside</a>, a city
built near sea level in a region where, possibly because of Tillamook Head,
there is a tendency for strong concentration of energy. <a href="anim">Long Beach, WA </a> and <a href="anim">Crescent City, CA </a> are examples of high-risk communities in neighboring states.

<h3><a name="es">Executive Summary</a></h3>
A numerical model of the tidal circulation of Tillamook Bay was developed, with 
the purpose of providing background support for management-oriented 
decisions and studies on water-quality and ecosystem dynamics. The model provides
a quantitative representation of spacial and temporal varions of tidal
circulation  (water levels and currents) in the estuary and near-shore 
vicinity, including tidal flat dynamics. The model does not currently but can 
be extend to represent the effects on the base tidal circulation of such forcings
as river discharges, wind, and ocean currents.<p>
Applied to bathymetric conditions characteristic of 1956 and 1995, respectively,
the model reveals significantly different patterns of bay circulation. 
The bay's apparent tendency to shallow in the tidal flats and to deepen in the
channels exacerbates a tendency for complex spacial and temporal patterns of 
circulation and transport. These patterns suggest that concepts such
as tidal prisms and residence times should not be applied simplistically as
a basis of management decisions.<p>
Three management issues on which the circulation model can be mostly useful 
used to support the CCMP process for Tillamook Bay are:
<ul>
<li>Differentiation of the impact of various fecal contamination sources.
<li>Re-definition of zoning and criteria for bay closure for the purpose of
shellfish harvesting.
<li>Characterization of the primary mode and frequency of change of the bay bathymetry.
</ul>
In parallel with the application of the model to this or other management 
issues, a sustained level of effort should be dedicated to further increase 
the reliability of the model, in particular through acquisition of field data.
In addition to acquisition of application-specific data, TBNEP should 
consider:  
<ul>
<li>Re-survey the bathymetry of the bay, to evaluate the impact of the 
extreme flood of 1996.
<li>Install two fixed tidal stations for the remaining duration of the project.
<li>Collect current and transport data, for detailed model validation.
</ul>

<h3><a name="in">1. Introduction</a></h3>
The Tillamook Bay estuary, the third largest in Oregon, covers an area of about 35km2,
of which 50-60% are tidal flats.
The estuary drains from a watershed that is more than 40 times as big (1484km2). 
The watershed is subject to strong precipitation, in the range of 
<a href="http://www.ocs.orst.edu/prism/or_precip.GIF">80-150 in/y</a>. 
Five main rivers (Miami, Kilchis, 
<a href="http://h2o.usgs.gov/swr/OR/data.modules/hist.cgi?statnum=14301500&bdate_month=08&bdate_day=01&bdate_year=1990&eday_month=09&edate_day=20&edate_year=1993&state=graph&graphsize=1.0">
Wilson,</a>
 Trask, and Tillamook) convey most of the strongly seasonal freshwater input to the estuary. 
The estuary is very shallow, with extensive mud flats partially carved out by three main 
channels (Bay City, Main, and South).

<br>

<br>Conflicting uses of the estuary and watershed has led EPA to create 
in 1994 the 
<a href="http://www.oes.orst.edu/estuary/nephome.html">
Tillamook Bay National Estuary Project (TBNEP)</a>.
 The objective of the TBNEP is to 
facilitate the creation of a scientifically-based management plan for the system, through 
a broad involvement of the relevant communities, agencies, and researchers. Early on in 
the process, TBNEP defined three priority problems:

<ul>

<li>Fecal contamination

<li>Bay sedimentation

<li>Salmon recovery 

</ul>

Subjacent to the first two and perhaps also the third of these priority problems is the 
need to understand the bay circulation. The present report describes the results of a 
project centered on the development and exploratory application of a bay-wide numerical 
circulation model. 

<p>

The target audience for this report are the various TBNEP committees, and the 
managers and users of the bay and associated watershed. Consistently, rather than on 
the details of the numerical modeling, we concentrate here on the description of the 
conceptual model of the bay circulation that emerged from the simulations. The reader 
interested in the details is invited to browse at the TBNEP office the electronic 
repository of data and model results generated as a part of this project. 

<h3><a name="cm">2. A conceptual model of the Bay and its circulation</a></h3>

<h4>2.1. Bathymetry</h4> 
The bottom topography (bathymetry) of the estuary has evolved significantly over 
the last century. 
<a href="http://www.ccalmr.ogi.edu/~ppearson/IMG/sub.gif">By one account,</a>
the total volume of the estuary has decreased 67.1% 
(from 1867 to 1984) to 26,375 Kyd3. While the comparative accuracy of the data bases, 
assumptions and methods used in determining these changes is unknown, 
these numbers suggest that the estuary is "filling up"
at a fast rate. Intense anthropogenic activity 
both in the bay and in the watershed, combined with natural precipitation cycles, offer a 
rational explanation for this trend.

<br>

<br>A 
<a href="http://www.ccalmr.ogi.edu/~ppearson/tillamook/diff.html">comparison</a>
 of bathymetric data from 
<a href="http://www.ccalmr.ogi.edu/~ppearson/tillamook/bay56.html">1956</a>
and
<a href="http://www.ccalmr.ogi.edu/~ppearson/tillamook/bay95.html">1995</a>
provides a somewhat
different picture. 
Indeed, this comparison suggests that while the intertidal volume is indeed 
decreasing, the sub-tidal volume is actually increasing. Whether the whole-bay volume 
has increased or decreased since 1956 depends on the reference level used for volume 
evaluation. Also of interest is the fact that the channels have substantially shifted in 
position.

<br>

<br>It is however incontrovertible, based on either analysis, that the bay is in active 
bathymetric evolution. We hypothesize, based on qualitative observations and on the 
1956/1995 bathymetric comparison, that:

<dl>

<em>
<dd>Hypothesis 1: At present, bathymetric changes in Tillamook Bay are primarily 
due to episodic river floods, and only secondarily due to deposition/erosion 
associated with more characteristic circulation conditions. </em>   

</dl>

It is important to recognize that available data are insufficient to satisfactorily 
evaluate this hypothesis. However, the combination of an existing bathymetric survey in mid-
1995 with the occurrence of 
<a href="http://www.ocs.orst.edu/Flood2.html">extreme flooding</a>
 in early 1996, suggests that a comparable bathymetric survey in 1996 would go a long way 
 towards clarifying the importance of episodic floods in the bathymetry changes in Tillamook Bay.

<dl> 

<dd>Recommendation 1: We recommend that TBNEP conducts a bathymetric survey 
of equivalent coverage and accuracy of the survey conducted in 1995, to 
characterize the effects of the 1996 flood.

</dl>

<h4>2.2. Tides</h4>

Under non-flooding conditions, tides are the most dominant forcing in Tillamook. 
<a href="http://www.ccalmr.ogi.edu/~ppearson/IMG/sea_level.gif">
Tides are semi-diurnal, with significant diurnal asymmetries.</a> 
The entrance channel and 
the extensive mud flats are both key controlling elements of the tidal propagation in the 
bay. Mud flats, in particular, induce significant non-linear generation of shallow water 
tides, leading to distortion of the tides. relative to their open-coast shape. The importance 
of mud flats on tidal propagation suggests that:

<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../../~ppearson/tillamook/hypo2.html">Hypothesis 2:</a>
 Tidal propagation has changed from 1956 to 1995 in ways that 
can be directly related to changes in bathymetry, and, in particular, to mud flat shifts. 
</dl>

This hypothesis is difficult to prove based on tidal data, as tidal gauges have, both in 
this and in past studies, been typically installed away from mud flats. However, numerical 
simulations provide strong and convincing evidence. This is illustrated by the 
<a href="http://www.ccalmr.ogi.edu/~ppearson/tillamook/amp_pha.html">
comparison 
of the amplitudes and phases of individual tidal constituents</a>,
 for simulations performed 
respectively with the 1956 and 1995 bathymetries.

<br>

<h4>2.3. Tidal circulation</h4>

From a tidal circulation viewpoint, the bay consists of three very distinct regions: 

<ul>

	<li><a href="../../../../~ppearson/tillamook/ent_chan.html">the entrance channel</a>, 
	where velocities have a clearly defined principal axis, 
	have very elongated tidal ellipses, and can reach magnitudes of 2 m/s;

	<li><a href="../../../../~ppearson/tillamook/int_chan.html">the internal bay channels</a>, 
	where velocities are lower but
	still often have rather elongated tidal ellipses and well defined principal axis; and

	<li><a href="../../../../~ppearson/tillamook/mud_flts.html">the mud flats</a>,
	where velocities are much reduced and principal axis tend to 
	be poorly defined.

</ul>

Consistently with the previous section, we suggest that:

<ul>

	<li><a href="../../../../~ppearson/tillamook/hypo3.html">Hypothesis 3:</a>
	 Changes in tidal circulation between 1956 and 1995 are 
	significant, and can be directly related to changes in bathymetry, 
	in particular, to changes in 
	channel location and geometry. 

</dl>

No direct current measurements exist to support this hypothesis. However, 
numerical simulations performed with, respectively, the 1956 and 1995 
bathymetries, provide 
convincing evidence. This evidence can be best observed through 
<a href="http://www.ccalmr.ogi.edu/~ppearson/tillamook/anim.html">
animations 
of instantaneous flows.</a>

<br>

<p>
<h3><a name="me">3. Methods</a></h3>
Central to this research was the use of a domain-wide numerical circulation model. 
The model is   based on the unstructured finite-element algorithm of Luettich and
Westerink 1995. This algorithm uses a time-domain continuity-wave equation 
formulation 
(Luettich et al. 1991), modified to account for wetting and drying. 
Three other algorithms 
were considered but not retained: one (Mader 1988) did not meet 
computational efficiency
targets, other (Walter 1988) did not address wetting and drying, and a third 
(Beck and Baptista 9915) 
was insufficiently mature at the time of the choice of the model.

<br>

<br>
<a href="../../../../~ppearson/tillamook/WQ.html">
Field data</a>
 used to topologically define, to force, and to calibrate/validate the model 
was largely pre-existing (Pearson et al. 1995). Exceptions were 
<a href="../../../../~ppearson/tillamook/tgage.html">
tidal gauge</a>
 data collected
by the authors as a part of the project in four stations across the estuary, 

<a href="http://www.ccalmr.ogi.edu/~ppearson/tillamook/wilson.html">
Wilson River discharge data</a>
data collected by the USGS under TBNEP contract, and 

<a href="http://www.ccalmr.ogi.edu/~ppearson/IMG/bay95.gif">
bathymetric data</a> 
collected by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

under TBNEP contract. Pre-existing 
and new data are documented in the "electronic laboratory" (ELAB) installed by the 
authors at TBNEP. 

<br>

<br>The calibration/validation of the circulation model was fundamentally based on 
contrasting the model against tidal data at available gauges. 
Results are documented in the 
ELAB installed at TBNEP, and show a 
<a href="http://www.ccalmr.ogi.edu/~ppearson/IMG/cal1.gif">
reasonable but not perfect agreement</a>. 
Differences appear
to reflect to a large extent the insufficiency of bathymetric 
information in the 
upstream end of the estuary, where the Kilchis, Wilson, Trask, and 
Tillamook converge in 
deltaic formations.

<rb>

<h3><a name="fc">4. Final considerations</a></h3>

Our research portrays a system in active evolution. At the root of this evolution are 
changes in bathymetry, which we hypothesize to occur abruptly and to be primarily 
induced by episodic river floods. Once the bathymetry changes, tidal 
propagation and bay 
circulation and transport follow suite, in ways that are markedly influenced by the new 
bathymetry. Resulting erosional/depositional patterns will tend to re-establish a dynamic
equilibrium, likely distinct from that prior to the flood.

<br>

<br>Under this scenario, the frequency of abrupt bathymetric changes is of clear 
significance to both the management of the bay and the supporting methods of study. This 
frequency is, unfortunately, poorly understood. Empirical personal observations (e.g., by 
fishermen and shellfish growers) is useful but qualitative and insufficient.

<br>

<br>The extreme flood of 1996, coupled with a detailed bathymetric survey in 1995, 
offers an outstanding opportunity to characterize the response of the bay bathymetry to 
floods. If this characterization can further identify (e.g., via numerical modeling) "trigger 
flood levels" beyond which significant bathymetry changes occur, then the potential 
exists to identify through historical records of precipitation and river flow data the 
frequency of the changes.

<br>

<br>Frequent changes would, in particular, suggest that a priority management decision 
is whether or to what extent should floods be actively controlled. If no active control is 
exerted, then management practices such as criteria for determining shellfish harvesting 
closures should account for a frequently changing environment; this may, in extreme, 
mean the need to revise closure regions and criteria after each trigger flood. If active 
control is considered, environmental bay-wide impacts need to be understood and 
accepted.

<br>

<br>Infrequent changes would pose a simpler management problem, and would more 
justifiably distance bay sediment dynamics from the other two TBNEP priority problems: 
fecal contamination and salmon restoration. 

<br>

<br>Under the scenario of frequent changes, bay modeling should probably evolve 
towards real or quasi-real time nowcast-forecast systems. TBNEP has coincidentally 
taken some of the required steps, by deploying continually-monitoring discharge gauges 
in each of the three main rivers draining to the bay. This effort can be extended in a
relatively straightforward manner to include strategically located tidal gauges and wind 
meter(s). However, the scientific challenge of coupling these external forcings and 
internal controls with reliable real or quasi-real time integrated numerical models 
(of bay circulation,
 sediment transport, and water quality) remains significant.

<br>

<br>Part of the challenge is to address the limitations of the present study of circulation. 
The study provides a credible representation and interpretation of tidal propagation, circulation, and transport, but does not address other external forcings. 
Conspicuously 
absent is in particular the effect of river discharges, whose introduction in the circulation 
model depends upon the availability of bathymetry (a) in the deltaic region of the upper 
estuary and (b) in the tidal-influenced part of the five main rivers. While (a) is being 
addressed by an aerial photo survey to be conducted this Summer by the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers, (b) is yet to be defined as a priority by TBNEP.

<br>

<br>Another, more complex, part of the challenge is the development of a reliable 
sediment transport model, to couple with the existing circulation model and its extensions. 
This requires a characterization of the sediments of the bay that may realistically be 
beyond the two remaining years of the life of the TBNEP project.

<p>
As a part of our research on Cascadia Subduction Zone tsunamis, we are
investigating tsunamis elsewhere, to obtain insights on
the mechanisms of generation, propagation, and inundation, and to
assess modeling methodologies.  The 1993 Hokkaido Nansei-Oki tsunami 
has been particularly interesting, because of the relative 
abundance of field data.<p>
A post-tsunami survey (Baptista et al.1993) was followed
by a diagnostic inversion of both the tsunami run-ups (Myers et al. 1993)
and by forward numerical modeling of the tsunami propagation (Myers and
Baptista 1995). More recently (Myers and Baptista 1996),
numerical solutions were developed for the 
Hokkaido Nansei-Oki benchmark (problem #4) of the International Workshop on 
Long-Wave Run-up Modeling.<p>
The use of locally-refined unstructured grids in association with inundation 
algorithms (Luettich and Westerink 1995) has substantially improved modeling results 
from Myers and Baptista (1995) to Myers and Baptista (1996). In the latter, observed trends
of propagation and run-up are reallistically represented.
Significant uncertainties remain, however, regarding the characteristics of the 
source mechanism.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
The <a href=//www.mbl.edu/html/ECOSYSTEMS/lmer/columbia/columbia.html/>
Columbia River Estuarine Turbidity Maxima (CRETM)</a> project focuses 
on the estuarine turbidity maximum, which is the heart of the
estuarine ecosystem. Long-term funding (1990-2000) allows analysis of 
seasonal and interannual
variability in estuarine processes and evaluation of the impacts of 
flow regulation on the system. The
extensive data sets collected by this program provide a basis for 
studies of estuarine circulation,
hydraulic control processes at the estuary mouth, nonstationary 
tidal processes, suspended sediment
transport, turbulence and mixing, and biological processes.

<h3>Brief Description</strong></h3>
<p>
The traditional coordinate system (sigma coordinates) used to discretize the
vertical direction in most three-dimensional shallow water models
is overly restrictive relative to the vertical nodal placement: nodes
must be located at the intersection of vertical lines with planes of constant
sigma. In particular, this restriction implies that the number of nodes per
vertical must be constant throughout the domain. This restriction may be highly
undesirable, specially in domains including both shallow and deep waters, or
when local stratification is present.
<p>
Localized sigma coordinates combine the main advantages, as well as
disadvantages of the traditional sigma coordinates with a higher flexibility
to discretize the vertical direction: the nodal placement is independent for
each vertical, thus local refinements do not carry over to the rest of the
domain.
<p>
Criteria for vertical nodal placement, as well as for the horizontal
distribution of the total number of nodes, were developed and validated
for barotropic tidal flows. With these criteria, localized sigma coordinates
can reduce maximum velocity errors relative to an comparable sigma coordinate
grid by a factor of two.

<a name="des"><h3>CATALOGUE DESCRIPTION</i></h3></a>
Introduction to numerical methods for environmental fluid dynamics. 
Theory and application 
of the solution of intial-value, boundary-value, and mixed 
initial-boundary value problems 
by finite differences, weighted residuals, numerical integration, 
and finite elements.
<p><hr>
<a name="goa"><h3>GOALS</h3></a>
By the end of the quarter, students should be able to solve common partial 
differential equations by conventional numerical methods, and to understand 
the potential and limitations of their chosen method. Students should also 
be able to understand and use selected advanced methods for the transport 
equation.
<p><hr>
<a name="top"><h3>TOPICS</h3></a>
<ul>
<strong><li>Introduction and context</strong><br>
Motivation and overview of course. 
 [lecture <a href="lectures/lect1.html">1</a>] 
<strong><li> Boundary-value problems (1D)</strong><br>
Finite-differences (FD): concept, construction of FD approximations, 
matrix assemblage, introduction of boundary conditions, brief error analysis. 
Systems of linear equations: a brief review of matrices, and a glance at
matrix solvers. 
The method of weighted residuals: concept, choice of interpolation functions, choice of 
weighting functions, strong versus weak formulations, treatment of boundary 
conditions. 
The finite element method (weighted residual approach): concept, weighted residual 
statement in a discrete context, shape functions and elemental mappings, differentiation 
and integration (Newton-Cotes, Gauss, and Lobatto), matrix assemblage, strong and weak 
formulations, Galerkin and Collocation FE, treatment of boundary conditions.

]
<li> <strong>Initial-value problems (1D)</strong><br>
Time integration techniques: alfa-methods, Runge-Kutta, Predictor-corrector, 
Richardson's extrapolation, finite elements. Concepts, formulations, the notion and 
implications of explicit vs. implicit techniques, brief error analysis [lectures 11, 12]
<li> <strong>Mixed initial-boundary value problems (1D)</strong><br>
Extended introduction to methods for formal error analysis, with emphasis on 
Von Neuman/Fourier analysis. Conventional FE solution techniques for selected 
equations: diffusion equation, advection-diffusion equation, shallow water equations. 
Emphasis on time-domain methods, based on Galerkin FE methods
Special techniques (upwind, Eulerian-Lagrangian and particle methods) for the 
advection-diffusion equation. [lectures  13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]
<li> <strong>Multi-dimensional initial-boundary value problems</strong><br>
An overview of fundamental and practical differences with regard to the 
one-dimensional case. Shape functions and elemental mappings for 2D and 3D 
elements. Grid generation issues. 
Treatment of boundary conditions.

<h3>SOFTWARE</h3>
Students are not expected to code extensively during the course. 
However, they are expected to use a mix of existing 
in-house and external (commercial and public domain) software,
if required by homework sets and exams.  A list of this 
<!--a href="scores/software.html"-->software and instructions for use</a>
 will be posted as the course evolves.

<h3>
Introduction
</h3>

We provide solutions to benchmark problems 2 through 4, using two
different finite element models. Both models (Luettich and Westerink
1995 and Beck and Baptista 1995) solve the 2D shallow water equations,
but differ significantly on the solution strategy for both wet
propagation and for inundation. 
<p>

The model of <a href="#beck-baptista-1995">Beck and Baptista
(1995)</a> (WET2) is in the development stage, and we expect it to
represent the core of a new generation of 2D and 3D CCALMR models for
coastal circulation and coastal hazards. The model of <a
href="#luettich-westerink-1995">Luettich and Westerink (1995)</a>
(ADCIRC) is a more mature model, which adds inundation capability to
the original algorithm of <a href="#luettich-et-al-1991">Luettich et
al. (1991)</a>. Earlier versions of ADCIRC, without inundation
capabilities but modified to include bottom excitation and
transmissive boundary conditions, have been used at CCALMR for tsunami
simulations (<a href="#myers-1994">Myers 1994</a>, <a
href="#myers-baptista-1995">Myers and Baptista 1995</a>, and <a
href="#baptista-et-al-1995">Baptista et al. 1995</a>).
<p>


In this document, WET2 is used on problems 2 and 3, and ADCIRC on
problem 4. We expect to generate WET2 solutions for problem 4 before
the workshop in September. We also plan to make updates of our results
and of this document available through the World Wide Web (WWW). 

<p>

The emphasis of our analysis has been on the robustness of the
numerical algorithms. However, we remain unconvinced that the
hydrodynamics of the problem, particularly regarding inundation, is
properly described by traditional forms of the shallow water equation
and simplifications thereof, and we expect to have to re-visit this
issue in the future.  


<h3>
Background
</h3>

Our interest in the simulation of long-wave propagation, runup and
inundation stems from three types of coastal issues. The first is the
intrinsic hydrodynamics of estuaries. Many estuaries have extensive
tidal flats. The quasi-periodic wetting and drying of tidal flats
throughout the tidal cycle, in combination with river floods, has a
range of scientific, engineering and management implications on the
basis of water levels and water currents alone. The second and
associated issue is the transport and fate of natural and
anthropogenic tracers in estuaries and its impact on ecosystem
dynamics and on land-ocean exchange. The third issue is coastal hazard
assessment and emergency planning associated mainly with tsunamis and
storm surges. 
<p>


In all cases, the computational challenge lies primarily on a "robust"
representation of water levels and velocity fields in the very shallow
and transitionally dry regions. In theory, "robust" implies a stable,
mass and momentum preserving solution, a goal that (taken strictly)
remains elusive for many problems. 

<p>

Several other researchers, driven by the same or associated types of
issues, have investigated the numerical modeling of coastal
circulation and coastal inundation. Models for coastal circulation
(exclusive of inundation) have been available since the mid
50s. Finite differences and finite elements are the more popular
solution methods, but finite volumes are also becoming of
interest. Both models considered here use finite elements. 

<p>

Reported methods for inundation vary widely, but can be divided in two
very broad groups: moving grids and fixed grid methods. While
conceptually more elegant, moving grid methods have significant
practical limitations. Fixed grid methods have therefore been more
broadly used, and are also retained in both models used here. 


<h3>
Models
</h3>

<h5>
WET2
</h5>

WET2 was initially based on TELEMAC (<a
href="#galland-et-al-1991">Galland et al. 1991</a>) but has been
developed separately. It is a 2D finite element model, based on the
primitive equation form of the shallow water equations, which uses an
Eulerian-Lagrangian approach for dealing with advection. The version
WET2 used for this workshop is based on the shallow water equations
cast in total depth form:
<p align=center>
<img src="ccalmr-eq1.gif">
<p align=center>
<img src="ccalmr-eq2.gif">
<p align=center>
<img src="ccalmr-eq3.gif">
<p align=center>
<img src="ccalmr-eq4.gif">
<p>
A solution step in WET2 is split into two stages, 1) tracking through
the velocity field to obtain estimations of the physical variables at
the next time level <img src="ccalmr-inline1.gif">, 2) correcting
these estimates, using the remaining physical processes, to obtain the
final physical variables at the next time level <img
src="ccalmr-inline2.gif">. Stage 1 uses the backwards tracking of
velocity-based characteristic lines to solve for the following set of
equations:
<p align=center>
<img src="ccalmr-eq5.gif">
<p align=center>
<img src="ccalmr-eq6.gif">
<p align=center>
<img src="ccalmr-eq7.gif">
<p>
Stage 2 uses a linear Galerkin finite element approach to solve the
following set of equations which are the shallow water equations minus
the advective processes: 
<p align=center>
<img src="ccalmr-eq8.gif">
<p align=center>
<img src="ccalmr-eq9.gif">
<p align=center>
<img src="ccalmr-eq10.gif">
<p>
An alpha method is used in the finite difference time discretization
of the above equations resulting in the following set. 
<p align=center>
<img src="ccalmr-eq11.gif">
<p align=center>
<img src="ccalmr-eq12.gif">
<p align=center>
<img src="ccalmr-eq13.gif">
<p>


The continuity and momentum equations are coupled so that <img
src="ccalmr-inline2.gif"> are obtained simultaneously. WET2 employs an
element-by-element method (<a href="#hervouet-1992">Hervouet
1992</a>), for sparse representation of the mass matrix, coupled with
a conjugate gradient method for solving the system of equations
resulting from the application of the finite element method in stage
2. A detailed description of WET2 will be published separately (<a
href="#beck-baptista-1995">Beck and Baptista 1995</a>).

<p>

The current scheme for handling inundation in WET2 follows <a
href="#leclerc-et-al-1990">Leclerc et al. (1990)</a>. The basic
premise of this scheme is to remove the gravity forcing term in
partially wet elements based upon a minimum total depth
(Hmin). Viscosity is also increased by an order of magnitude in these
elements.

<p>

WET1, the 1D equivalent to WET2, uses the same solution approach as
WET2 except that it does not currently use the <a
href="#leclerc-et-al-1990">Leclerc et al. (1990)</a> scheme for
dealing with inundation. WET1 was used for the solution of problems
3A-C in which inundation does not occur.

<h5>
ADCIRC
</h5>

ADCIRC-2DDI is the two-dimensional, depth-integrated option of a
series of finite element hydrodynamic codes called ADCIRC (<a
href="#luettich-et-al-1991>Luettich et. al. 1991</a>). This model
solves the shallow water equations, with the momentum equations
written in non-conservative form, and the continuity equation written
in a generalized wave form. The use of wave continuity rather than
primitive continuity equations was introduced by <a
href="#lynch-gray-1979">Lynch and Gray (1979)</a> and later generalized by
<a href="#kinnmark-gray-1984">Kinnmark and Gray (1984)</a>; the
approach is effective at eliminating spurious 2<img
src="ccalmr-Delta.gif">x oscillations which have been known to plague
some primitive formulations.

<p>

The most recent version of ADCIRC-2DDI (<a
href="#luettich-westerink-1995">Luettich and Westerink 1995</a>) has
extended to the last version the ability to accommodate wetting and
flooding. This is accomplished by turning elements on and off based on
whether they are wet or dry, respectively. At each time step, nodes in
the finite element grid are classified as being either "dry",
"interface", or "wet" nodes. Dry nodes are connected only to elements
considered to be dry, and are therefore constrained to have zero
velocities and constant water levels. Interface nodes are connected to
both wet and dry elements and are treated as traditional land boundary
nodes where a no-slip condition prevails and the water level is
allowed to move up and down. Wet nodes are connected only to wet
elements and are thus not subject to any special constraints.

<p>

Drying of nodes may occur in one of two ways. First, if the water
level at a node falls below a critical minimum depth, the node is
subsequently classified as a dry node. However, as a node begins to
wet, the minimum depth is ramped from a value of zero to the specified
critical depth over a certain number of time steps. This helps to
maintain numerical stability, and the node is permitted to dry after
the ramping has been enforced. Second, the situation may arise where a
node has a water level above the minimum depth yet is surrounded by
elements considered to be dry. In this case, the node is allowed to
dry. The wetting of nodes requires a decision box which determines
whether or not the node, if wetted, will witness increased water
levels in the following time steps. Therefore, a node is considered to
be wet if the water level gradient and the vector sum of the water
level gradient and the wind stress both indicate water motion in the
direction of all the dry nodes connected to the interface node in
question. Due to the fact that inherent numerical dispersion can
accelerate the flooding process, a critical amount of water must
accumulate in a wet element before the front advances. 

<p>

The solution procedure in ADCIRC consists of solving for elevations
from the generalized wave continuity equation (GWCE) and
depth-integrated velocities from the primitive momentum
equations. Numerical discretization of these equations requires
formulating weak weighted residual statements, discretizing in time
all appropriate variables, and implementing the finite element
method. The user has the option of specifying a fully consistent or a
lumped formulation of the linear time derivative terms in the
GWCE. The inundation algorithm requires that the GWCE be reset at each
time step that wetting or drying is transpiring. Various matrix
solvers are available for solution of the GWCE, including a direct
matrix solver, conjugate gradient methods, and a simple diagonal
solver for a fully implicit, lumped formulation. Mass lumping is
enforced in the momentum equations to allow for a diagonal matrix and
a trivial solution. 

<h3>
Set-up and results for individual problems
</h3>

<h4>
Problem 2 - Runup of solitary waves on a circular island
</h4>

<h5>
Set-up
</h5>

The specifications of the benchmark problem were followed strictly
with regard to the geometry of the domain (basin and circular
island). However, simplifications were made on the description of the
excitation and on the treatment of the absorbing walls: 

<ul>
<li> Excitation: rather than representing the paddle motion as a
moving wall, we forced water velocities at the wall to match those of
the paddle; paddle trajectories (provided by H. Yeh) were
differentiated with respect to time and fit with a gaussian curve. The
derived velocities are shown in <a href="#figure2.1a">Figures
2.1a-c</a> for the three cases specified by the organizers.

<li>	Absorbing walls: absorption at the walls was neglected;
     rather, zero normal fluxes were specified. This will have
     implications for results late in the simulation, but should not
     be significant during the first approach of the wave to the
     island. 
</ul>

The domain was discretized with 3-node triangles. The flat basin was
discretized with uniform right triangles (<img
src="ccalmr-Delta.gif">x=0.25m, <img src="ccalmr-Delta.gif">y=0.30m)
and the cone was discretized using concentric circular bands of
triangles: 10 for the coarse grid (<a href="#figure2.2a">Figure
2.2a</a>) and 40 for the refined grid (<a href="#figure2.2b">Figure
2.2b</a>). All the results shown were obtained using a time step of
0.05 seconds. The coarse grid was used to solve all cases
A-C. Viscosity and friction coefficients were varied for these
simulations in order to determine the sensitivity of the solution to
these parameters. The following parameters characterize our baseline
simulation:

<ul>
<li> Numerical Grids: Coarse (<a href="#figure2.2a">Figure 2.2a</a>,
20094 elements, 10277 nodes), Fine (<a href="#figure2.2b">Figure
2.2b</a>, 38715 elements, 19677 nodes)

<li>	Time Step: <img src="ccalmr-Delta.gif">t=0.05s (maximum courant # ~0.35)

<li>	Forcing: normal velocity imposed at x=0 according to <a
     href="#figure2.1a">Figures 2.1a-c</a> 

<li>	Minimum depth used for the inundation algorithm, Hmin=1.0e-4m

<li>	All non-linear terms, include advection, were included in the
simulations 

<li>	Time-weight: <img src="ccalmr-alpha.gif">=0.5

<li>	Friction: Manning formulation <img src="ccalmr-feq1.gif"> with n=0.02

<li>	Viscosity: <img src="ccalmr-nu.gif">=1.0e-3m^2/s
</ul>

The refined grid shown in <a href="#figure2.2b">Figure 2.2b</a> was
used for cases B and C in an attempt to capture more of the small
scale flow features near the cone. There are approximately 4 times as
many elements defining the cone in the refined grid than in the
coarser grid.

<h5>

<h5>
Discussion
</h5>

This benchmark is based on laboratory and numerical experiments
partially reported by <a href="#yeh-et-al-1994">Yeh et al. (1994)</a>. Those experiments suggest
that aspects of the tsunami runup and inundation observed at the
islands of Bali (1992 Flores tsunami) and perhaps Okushiri (1993
Hokkaido tsunami) may be associated with the formation of trapped
waves. In particular, <a href="#yeh-et-al-1994">Yeh et al. (1994)</a> conclude that, for islands
with size of the same order of magnitude of the wavelength of an
incident wave, trapped waves are formed in each side of the island,
and their collision behind the island leads to substantial
magnification of the wave amplitude near shore and to significant flow
runup onto the beach. 

<p>

Our numerical simulations are generally consistent with the
qualitative behavior described above. However, actual magnification of
the wave amplitude and of the flow runup depend both on the problem
and on the choice of the physical parameters. In particular, using the
reference run as the basis for discussion, we note that: 

<ul>
<li>	The ratio of the maximum wave height in the back and in the
front of the island decreases as we progress from case A to case C
(<a href="#figure2.5a">Figures 2.5a-c</a>), i.e., suggesting decreasing magnification as the
period of the incident wave decreases. 

<li> Velocities behind the island clearly suggest the potential for
     concentrated inundation, but do not exhibit the magnification
     factors (relative to velocities in the front of the island,
     Figures <a href="#figure2.4a">2.4a-c</a> and <a
href="#figure2.6a">2.6a-c</a>) reported by <a
href="#yeh-et-al-1994">Yeh et al. (1994)</a>.

<li> Friction parametrization impacts negligibly the wave heights in
front of the island, but affects significantly wave propagation around
and behind the island. In particular, friction parametrization has a
major effect on the extent of the wave amplification behind the
island, because both the left and right trapped waves are exposed to
significant frictional damping as they travel in the very shallow
nearshore water.

<li>	Most of our runs use stronger friction than that likely
present in the laboratory experiments. This might explain why our
velocity magnification and extent of inundation behind the island are
weaker than reported by <a href="#yeh-et-al-1994">Yeh et al. (1994)</a>. 

<li>	Results are quite sensitive to viscosity. High viscosities
damp the wave very substantially, and mask some of the interesting
physics of the problem (e.g., the wave magnification behind the
island). 
</ul>

Simulations with no or weaker friction and with no or weaker viscosity
are in progress, and are expected to be physically closer to the
conditions present in the laboratory experiments. In particular, we
expect more substantial inundation to occur, and we expect a larger
magnification of wave heights and velocities behind the island. The
plot of maximum elevations for the refined grid and no friction shown
in <a href="#figure2.5b">Figure 2.5b</a> gives us some indication that
this may in fact be the case. 

<p>

Numerically, the model appears robust in the range of parameters
tested. However, the plots of maximum wave heights and maximum
velocity magnitudes (Figures <a href="#figure2.5a">2.5a-c</a> and <a
href="#figure2.6a">2.6a-c</a>) show, for the reference grid, wiggly
patterns that we attribute to coarse spacial representation of the
land-water interface. Results with the refined grid for case C
(Figures <a href="#figure2.5c">2.5c</a> and <a
href="#figure2.6c">2.6c</a>) ameliorate this behavior dramatically,
but also lead to a decrease of the wave heights at Station 4 (<a
href="#figure2.3l">Figure 2.3l</a>) and an overall decrease in maximum
elevations around the entire perimeter of the cone (<a
href="#figure2.5c">Figure 2.5c</a>). The reason for this decrease is
being investigated in further detail. Results with the refined grid
and no friction for case B also smooth the shape of the maximum
elevation and velocity plots (Figures <a href="#figure2.5b">2.5b</a>
and <a href="#figure2.6b">2.6b</a>), but they also show a substantial
increase in the maximum elevation at the front and rear of the cone.

<h4>
Problem 3 - Runup of solitary waves on a vertical wall
</h4>

<h5>
Set-up
</h5>

Due to the essentially 1D nature of this problem, WET1 was used in
place of WET2. These models differ only in the inundation scheme
used. Otherwise the specifications of the benchmark problem were
followed strictly with regard to the geometry of the domain.  

<p>

As in problem 2, rather than representing the paddle motion as a
moving wall, we forced water velocities at the wall. These derived
velocities are shown in Figure 3.1 for the three cases specified by
the organizers. 

<p>

The domain was discretized with a uniform finite element grid,
composed of linear 1D elements 1cm in length. The same spacial and
temporal discretization was adopted for the three cases
specified. Characteristics of our baseline simulations are shown
below: 

<ul>
<li>	Numerical Grid Spacing: <img src="ccalmr-Delta.gif">x=1cm (2324 nodes, 2323 elements)

<li>	Time step:<img src="ccalmr-Delta.gif">t=0.1s (maximum courant # ~14.6)

<li>	Forcing: normal velocity imposed according to <a
     href="#figure3.1a">Figures 3.1a-c</a> 

<li>	All non-linear terms, including advection, were used in all
simulations 

<li>	Time-weight: <img src="ccalmr-alpha.gif">=0.5

<li>	Friction: Manning formulation <img src="ccalmr-feq1.gif"> with n=0.02

<li>	Viscosity: <img src="ccalmr-nu.gif">=1.0e-3m^2/s
</ul>

<h5>
Results
</h5>

<a href="#figure3.2a">Figures 3.2a-f</a> show time histories of
elevation as requested. Each of these plots shows the baseline
simulation along with two additional simulations with increased
viscosity. These additional simulations were used to determine the
sensitivity of the results to viscosity.

<p>

Also as requested, Table 1 provides normalized maximum vertical runup
heights at the vertical wall. The runup heights were normalized using
the maximum amplitude of elevation at the end where the wave was
generated.

<h5>
Discussion
</h5>

The numerical simulations appear robust, even for the very large
Courant number adopted. The trailing wave train generated when
viscosity is low might result from the fact that the shallow water
equations cannot sustain the form of a solitary wave. Solutions are
very sensitive to viscosity, but the range of viscosity coefficients
that we adopted extends beyond the range expected in a laboratory
experiment. 

<p>

A more detailed analysis of the results is in progress.


<h4>
Problem 4
</h4>

<h5>
Set-up
</h5>

The Hokkaido Nansei-Oki tsunami of July 12, 1993 is simulated using
the specified bathymetric and initial condition data. Due to the large
number of bathymetric data (309,056 points), grids with less-than-full
discretization are being tested for this benchmark problem. Two finite
element grids have been created: 1) the first grid is composed of
every fifth bathymetric point from Region A of the benchmark
specifications for all of the region except in the vicinity of
Okushiri Island, where every point was utilized (see <a href="#figure4.1">Figure 4.1</a>), 2)
the second grid is the same as the first, with added refinement closer
to the island of Okushiri (see <a href="#figure4.1">Figure 4.2</a>). Unfortunately, the
coarseness of the first grid (<img src="ccalmr-Delta.gif">x is 1800 m
throughout the region, and 450 m around Okushiri) does not allow for
much inundation due to the large topographic slopes between grid
points, and the second grid does not overcome this problem to an
adequate degree. Grids that make use of the localized topographic data
available from the other data sets (regions B1, B2, B3, C1, C2) are in
preparation and will soon be updated to this forum.



Initial conditions are provided at the same nodes as the bathymetric
data points. The bottom deformation is displayed in <a
href="#image4.1">Image 4.1</a> and consists of a longer
northern source and a shorter southern source. The deformation is
imposed in the continuity equation (GWCE in ADCIRC) linearly over
three time steps. Rather conventionally, the revised continuity
equation is formulated by incorporating the bottom deformation into
the kinematic boundary condition, thus leading to the following:

<p align=center>
<img src="ccalmr-eq14.gif">
<p>

where h is the free surface elevation, <img src="ccalmr-gamma.gif"> is
the bottom deformation, u and v are the depth-integrated velocities,
and H is the total water column.

<p>

The set-up of this benchmark problem is adequate to allow comparison
with other modeling studies of this tsunami event, in particular <a
href="#myers-baptista-1995">Myers and Baptista (1995)</a>. Myers and
Baptista compare observed tide gauge responses with modeling results
for a variety of ADCIRC simulations. Each of the simulations is
designed to be representative of the different seismic source
scenarios proposed by various agencies. Results from this benchmark
problem should yield valuable insight as to the effect of the
following aspects on numerical simulations: 1) the difference between
seismic scenarios (Myers and Baptista did not simulate DCRC-17a), 2)
regional bathymetric differences, and 3) the effect of inundation and
the lack of a minimum depth requirement (Myers and Baptista did not
consider inundation and needed to specify an artificial minimum depth
to guarantee stability during non-linear simulations).

<h5>
Results
</h5>

Results are provided in the form of maximum elevations and wave
propagation patterns. Animations <a href="#animation4.1">4.1</a> and
<a href="#animation4.2">4.2</a> show the temporal nature of the
elevations throughout the region and around Okushiri, respectively. <a
href="#animation4.2">Animation 4.2</a> shows inundation occurring
(although in a limited manner) at various places including Aonae,
(near) Monai, and the northern tip of the island. The wrap-around
effect of the wave around Aonae (first being subjected to the wave
from the west, followed by the same wave "wrapping around" and
seemingly approaching from an easterly direction) can also be clearly
seen. <a href="#animation4.1">Animation 4.1</a> displays regional
tsunami propagation, and also reveals a caution flag due to the
performance of the transmissive boundaries imposed at all non-land
boundaries. Thus, the waves do not successfully travel through the
boundaries and end up reversing their direction toward the Japan
islands. This is a temporary limitation, and updated simulations will
be posted in a later version of this text.

<p>

Isolines of maximum elevation are displayed in the <a
href="#image4.2">Image 4.2</a>. The southwest coast of Okushiri, the
southeast corner of Aonae, and the northern tip of the island appear
to sustain the largest wave elevations. <a href="#figure4.3">Figure
4.3</a> displays the coastal maximum wave heights for Okushiri. These
results compare favorably with field survey data as displayed in <a
href="#figure4.4">Figure 4.4</a>. Although the amplitudes are
under-represented, the patterns are very similar.

<h5>
Discussion
</h5>

The spatial distribution of maximum coastal wave heights obtained with
the coarse grid is encouraging. It is expected that more refined
grids, with better representation of the bathymetry/topography near
the coastline, will ameliorate the fact that magnitudes are
underestimated by allowing inundation to occur more significantly. 

<p>

Since comparisons are being made with field survey data, we are in the
process of obtaining the fault parameters necessary to compute the
energy of the tsunami as compared to other fault scenarios. Whether
the seismic source is realistic or not can in part be determined from
comparisons of computed and observed elevation time histories at
Esashi and Iwanai. <a href="#figure4.5">Figure 4.5</a> shows that
while the amplitudes of the waves are reasonably close, the periods
are not reproduced well. The phases of the preliminary waves are also
offset by several minutes.

<p>

The northern coastline of Hokkaido (above the latitude of the northern
tip of Okushiri) is impacted primarily by the generated wave of the
northern source, and the southern Hokkaido coastline (below the
latitude of Aonae) is impacted primarily by the wave generated from
the southern source. The two waves "wrap around" the island of
Okushiri, one from the north and the other from the south, and meet at
the center of the eastern coast of the island. This appears consistent
with the analysis of <a href="#yeh-et-al-1994">Yeh et al. (1994)</a>
regarding the formation of trapped waves around islands.

<h3><a name="des">CATALOGUE DESCRIPTION</a></i></h3>
Introduction to long wave flow and transport in estuaries and
coasts. Selected case studies are used to define a range of
coastal and land-margin issues, for which understanding a 
quantitative representation of specific physical, chemical, or
biological processes is required. Formal representation of these
processes is systematically presented. For some of the
processes, numerical modeling and field data analysis are also 
discussed. Topics include: tsunamis, tides and tidal circulation, 
water quality, sediment transport.
<p><hr>
<h3><a name="goa">GOALS</a></h3>
To provide students with a mix of descriptive and quantitative 
understanding of key estuarine and coastal processes, and their 
relationship with broad coastal and land-margin issues. Emphasis 
will be placed on physical processes, although connections will 
be made whenever appropriate to chemical and biological processes.

<h3><a name="ro">Research Overview</a></h3>
My research projects are diversified in scope and objectives,
and are often cast in a collaborative and interdisciplinary context. The
unifying theme is the understanding and modeling of processes that affect
the dynamics and management of coasts and land-margins.<p>
Two representative projects are introduced below.  For further details,
additional projects and a broader conceptual framework, see my 
<a href="/baptista/baptista_res.html">extended research overview</a>.
<dl>
<li>Cascadia Subduction Zone tsunamis<br>
Large tsunamis are believed to be locally generated in the Cascadia Subduction
Zone (CSZ) every 200 to 600 years, based on geological records. The last
large tsunami dates back about 300 years, raising concerns about the protection
of coastal communities in Oregon, Washington, California, and British Columbia.
The coastal impact of potential CSZ tsunamis is being investigated through
numerical modeling. The need to use geological evidence on paleotsunamis
as the sole, loose reference for model validation makes this an unusually
interesting and challenging problem.<p>
<li>Columbia River Research<br>
The Columbia River is a dominant oceanographic feature of the west coast
of the United States, and the locus of controversial ecosystem issues. Modeling
and field observations of the baroclinic circulation in the lower estuary
and mouth of the Columbia River are in progress, in a multi-year research
effort. Scientific goals include (a) enhanced understanding of turbulence
parametrization under dynamic stratification, (b) enhanced understanding
of the role of inter-tidal flats on the main estuarine circulation, and
(c) development of criteria for optimization of numerical grids. An expected
future development is a nowcast/forecast circulation model for the Lower
Columbia River.<p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
My research concentrates on modeling of long waves.
I am currently working on the following long wave projects:
1) modeling of Cascadia Subduction Zone tsunamis in 
the Pacific Northwest, 2) modeling of the July 12, 1993 
Hokkaido Nansei-oki tsunami in the Sea of Japan, 3) 
modeling of the 1964 Alaska tsunami, 4) regional tide 
model for the Eastern North Pacific Ocean.  Grid 
optimization techniques are being designed to enhance 
the ability of long-wave models to reproduce the 
physics in these systems.
<hr>
<p>
<h3><em>Tsunamis</em></h3>
Tsunami propagation is dealt with using a 2-dimensional 
finite element model (ADCIRC) which incorporates all 
hydrodynamic non-linearities.  The results depend upon how
numerically sound the grids are and how much
information is available about the bathymetry and
coastlines.  Research in tsunami generation
faces many barriers.  For example, many agencies
report different seismic parameters for the
same earthquake.  Also, the models which use
those parameters to paint an image of the deformation
in the sea floor are not exact when applied to
actual scenarios. Once the sea floor deformation 
for a particular earthquake is determined, the 
hydrodynamic finite element model is used to 
simulate propagation of the wave.
<h3><a href="oregonian">Impact of Tsunamis on Oregon Coastal Communities</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>
<h3><em>Tides</em></h3>
Tidal propagation in the Eastern Northern Pacific Ocean 
is evaluated through the use of a two-dimensional finite 
element model. The region of interest extends from the 
Aleutian islands to southern California and includes 
deep ocean, continental shelf, and shallow water features. 
Boundary conditions are determined from non-linear 
inversion of harmonic data from both shallow water and 
deep ocean pelagic tide gauges. Comparisons between model 
results and the original harmonic data reveal the sensitivity 
of the model to factors such as bathymetry, map projections, 
friction, and the choice of transfer functions/tide gauges 
used in the inversion. Root mean square errors in the final 
model results are generally contained to within 10.0 cm at 
both pelagic and coastal gauges. Model performance is also 
examined in the following respects: (1) comparison with a 
simulation for which the boundary conditions are extracted 
from a global inverse model, (2) the ability of the regional 
model results to provide boundary conditions for a more 
localized Columbia River tide model, and (3) the efficiency 
of mass and energy preservation.
<p>
Current global tide models face the dubious task of 
accurately discretizing very large domains. This translates 
into weaker depiction of continental slope and littoral 
zone processes due to errors in representing the bathymetry 
and coastline. Since much of the energy redistribution 
between various frequencies is occurring as the tides are 
propagating from the deeper water into coastal environments 
via the continental slope, global tide models are not the 
most appropriate tools to portray tidal processes in these 
zones. Further, since most local modeling studies are 
generally constrained to littoral regions, an effective tool 
is needed to link processes occurring in the open ocean and 
those occuring in more local environments. Regional tide 
models such as Baptista et. al. (1989) and Westerink et. al. 
(1992) have proven effective at bridging this gap between 
pelagic and littoral regions. A similar regional model is 
developed here for the Eastern North Pacific Ocean.

<h4>Oceanographic and Environmental Characterization of Coastal Regions</h4>
A.M. Baptista, P.G. Tratnyek, D.A. Jay, C. Pu, D.R. Boone, and C.D. Peterson<br>
<i>Proc. ONR Harbor Processes Workshop, May 1996 (Abstracts only)</i>
<hr>
<a name="obj"><h4>OBJECTIVES</h4>
<strong>Long-term:</strong> To enhance interdisciplinary, integrated understanding of oceanographic and 
environmental processes in estuaries and coastal regions, and to incorporate such understanding 
into diagnostic and predictive models, towards operational nowcast-forecast systems.
<p>
<strong>Short-term:</strong> (a) To enhance the observation and representation of selected hydrodynamic processes, 
with emphasis on density-driven turbulent flow and transport in tidal inlets, tidal propagation 
at coupled spatial scales, and longwave inundation. (b) To enhance the representation of geochemical 
and biogeochemical processes at sediment-water interfaces, under moderate shear. (c) To investigate 
software integration of field observations, laboratory experiments, and computer models.
<h4>APPROACH</h4>
This will be an interdisciplinary effort, involving balanced components of numerical modeling, 
field observations, laboratory experiments, and software integration. While predictive capability 
is an ultimate goal, numerical modeling will at this time be viewed primarily as a powerful 
integrator and testing vehicle for conceptual understanding. Field observations will be focused on 
hydrodynamic processes, and will be based on both moored and roving instrumentation 
systematically deployed in the Columbia River estuary. Deployment design will be guided by a 
combination of forward and inverse modeling. Laboratory experiments will be conducted primarily in 
a 1-1.5m diameter rotating flume, with sediments and water column subject to controlled shear and 
ultimately controlled density structure. Telemetry and a network of conventional and innovative 
probes will be designed to maximize the amount of continuous (rather than time-sporadic) data on 
physical, geochemical, and biogeochemical properties. Emphasis will be placed on the measurement 
of concentrations of redox-active elements, and of net redox potential. Data interpretation 
and experimental and sampling design will be assisted by a combination of hydrodynamic and 
geochemical and biogeochemical transport models, conceived for application at both laboratory 
and field scales. Models results and field and laboratory data will be integrated through a 
coherent system of software and networking tools, partly based on the experience of the 
Agile/Harvest and REINAS projects.
<a name="rel"><h4>RELEVANCE TO THE ONR HARBOR PROCESSES PROGRAM</h4></a>
In close alignment with the goals of the ONR Harbor Processes Program, this project will 
increase the integrated interdisciplinary science base available to understand contaminant  fate 
and effects in harbors and their surrounding estuarine and coastal environments. We will address 
two (water column and water/sea floor interfaces) of the three media targets of the 
Program, and will systematically investigate priority topics, with emphasis on the coupling of 
chemistry and biology with physical processes towards an integrated understanding of 
contaminant fate andof  improved monitoring strategies and risk-assessment.
