<h1>Managing Nematodes on Chile</H1>
<H2>Guide H-241</H2>
<H3>Stephen Thomas, Plant Pathologist/Nematologist</H3>

Several plant-parasitic nematodes are common chile pests in New Mexico, but only the southern root-knot nematode <I>(Meloidogyne incognita)</I> consistently inflicts significant damage to the crop. Root-knot nematodes reduce tonnage in both red and green chile and affect the quality of fresh market pods. Field survey results in 1991 indicated that in a typical year about half (more in Dona Ana and less in Eddy counties) of the state's chile acreage was infested with this pest (table 1).<P>

<H2>ABOUT THE PEST</H2>

Root-knot nematodes, and all other plant-parasitic nematodes for that matter, are microscopic round-worms that live in the water that plants use in the soil, and feed on or in the roots of these plants. Nematodes can't move about from one field to another easily because of their tiny size and aquatic nature, and they usually don't survive movement in blowing dust. Nematodes are spread mainly by agriculture and related activities that inadvertently move soil around on equipment, transplants, the feet of humans and other animals, or in irrigation water. Root-knot nematodes become active as soil warms up each spring, and quickly invade the roots of new chile seedlings. Once inside the root, each nematode swells and becomes pear-shaped, disrupting the developing root tissue. The nematode's life cycle is completed in about a month. The 200 to 500 eggs produced by females hatch rapidly, and the new juveniles invade other roots. At least four generations of nematodes can be produced on a chile crop in any season. Under ideal circumstances, each nematode that invades a chile root in early May can produce 250,000 offspring, which will damage the same or nearby plants while fruit is developing in late July. <P>


<H2>SYMPTOMS AND DAMAGE</H2>

Symptoms of root-knot nematode injury to chile vary with plant age and the severity of the nematode infestation. Because nematodes are sensitive to soil type, damage usually appears "patchy" rather than uniform across a field. Above-ground symptoms are not unique, and in fact are similar to symptoms produced by many other pathogens and abiotic disorders. Root-knot nematodes may reduce yield as much as 20% with no visible above-ground symptoms.<P>

Early-season damage may appear as seedling death or severe stunting in sandier portions of a field where nematode numbers can be higher. A single developing root-knot nematode inside the tap root of a chile seedling will completely block water transport, collapsing the stem at the soil line. This type of seedling damage may be confused with similar collapse due to salt, wind, or insect injury.<P>

Older plants that are heavily damaged by root-knot nematodes will be stunted and yellow or "chlorotic." Carefully digging (not pulling!) these plants and gently removing soil from the roots will expose galls or "knots" on the branch roots--and sometimes a distorted, forked or "doglegged" tap root. The galls can vary in size from smaller than a pinhead to larger than a pea, depending on age and number of nematodes.<P> 

Less severely injured plants appear somewhat chlorotic (particularly toward the end of the season) and may wilt more quickly than healthy plants. Closer examination of the roots of wilted plants should indicate whether or not nematodes are present. If the soil below the surface has sufficient moisture and the roots appear healthy (no signs of discoloration, rotting, or mechanical injury), root-knot nematodes may be the culprits--especially if some root galling is also visible. Failure to recognize root damage by nematodes could result in unnecessary irrigation, which would favor development and spread of Phytophthora root rot. <P>


<H2>DETECTION</H2>

The best method for detecting damaging root-knot nematode populations, and the only method for detecting damage from other plant-parasitic nematodes, is collecting soil samples to be analyzed for the type and number of nematodes present. Nematode populations almost never disappear: once they are detected in a field they will always be present at some level. Because root-knot nematodes produce galls, there is a tendency to simply dig or pull up plants and examine the roots for galls. Though sometimes reliable, this method frequently fails to detect root-knot nematode problems because  1) galled roots tend to break off and remain in the soil, 2) many excellent nematode hosts such as grain crops don't form galls, and 3) the amount of galling varies with crop cultivar, and isn't always a good indication of the severity of the root-knot problem. Always take soil samples when nematodes are suspected.<P>

<H3>How to Sample for Nematodes</H3>

Collect soil samples from the area where roots are growing, and to a depth of 6-10". Use a soil probe or a shovel and bucket. Because nematode numbers vary from one plant to the next, it is important to collect samples from around several different plants, mix the soil in the bucket, and put about a quart of the mixture in a plastic bag to submit for analysis.<P> 

Nematode samples must be treated differently than samples submitted for fertility analysis. The soil should remain close to the temperature and moisture level in the field; plastic bags are usually better than paper bags for transporting samples. If the soil dries out or gets too cold (don't put them in a refrigerator or on ice in a cooler) or too hot, the nematodes are killed and cannot be recovered from the sample. The best way to transport samples during the summer or fall is in a cooler without ice, but which is kept out of direct sunlight. Treat the sample like you would a Hershey Bar: any place that would melt the chocolate is likely to kill nematodes.<P>


Identifying nematode damage to an established chile crop is best done by comparing two soil samples--one from the problem area and another from areas in the same or nearby fields, which are growing normally. Such samples can be collected at any time during the season when symptoms appear. Samples to be used for making nematode management decisions should ideally be collected and submitted for analysis during September or October while a crop is still growing in the field where chile will be planted. Root-knot nematode numbers are at their highest at this time, and they are therefore easier to detect. Chile is highly susceptible to these nematodes, and samples collected in the spring following plowing sometimes don't detect damaging levels. The nematodes won't go away over the winter; they just become harder to find. If you live in one of the top 5 chile-producing counties, table 1 indicates the likelihood of finding root-knot nematodes in your chile crop, and lets you compare results with those from other fields in your county.<P>

<H3>Where to Send Samples</H3>

Nematode analysis is offered by different private soil testing laboratories and by the New Mexico Department of Agriculture. The time required to process and identify nematodes in a sample and report the results is generally 10 working days. NMDA analysis currently costs $25.00 per sample. <P>

<H2>NEMATODE MANAGEMENT</H2>

Many nematode management options that are useful in other crops are not practical in chile because of its high value and susceptibility to damage by small numbers of the pest. The following are points to consider in determining how to best manage nematodes on a field-by-field basis.<P>

<H3>Cultural Control</H3> 

Management practices such as crop rotation, fallowing, and cultivation can help reduce the numbers of some nematodes, therefore reducing crop damage. Unfortunately, all the commonly grown crops that are likely to precede chile (alfalfa, barley, corn, cotton, lettuce, onions, sorghum, and wheat) are sufficiently good hosts of the southern root-knot nematode in New Mexico to make them useless as rotation crops for reducing this pest. In research at NMSU, chile grown after any of these crops was damaged severely (yields reduced at least 40%). Older literature, which suggests rotating with small grains as a method for reducing root-knot nematode damage to chile, is not reliable for New Mexico, because these deductions about host suitability were usually based on the amount of galling observed on roots of the rotation crop. We now know that some grains can be excellent hosts for root-knot nematodes <I>without </I>forming noticeable galls.<P>

Fallowing, or keeping a field bare (of both a crop and weeds) during the growing season, works well to reduce root-knot nematodes. Results from other regions of the country indicate that fallowing may be as effective as pesticides for lowering numbers of some nematodes. Beside the obvious disadvantage of no income from the field under these conditions, it is still necessary to cultivate the field on a monthly basis to suppress weed growth. Research at NMSU has demonstrated that most weeds common to chile fields are good hosts for root-knot nematodes and allow them to build up, even if no crop is present. A partial list of weed hosts for the southern root-knot nematode in New Mexico includes both yellow and purple nutsedge <I>(Cyperus esculentus and C. rotundus)</I>, Wright groundcherry <I>(Physalis wrightii)</I>, Palmer amaranth or "pigweed" <I>(Amaranthus palmeri)</I>, and spurred anoda or "cotton weed"  <I>(Anoda cristata)</I>. Frequent disk-ing of soil and crop residue in nematode-infested fields during the late fall and early winter also helps reduce root-knot nematodes by exposing them to the environment, and may prove useful either by itself or with fallowing.<P>

<H3>Resistant Varieties</H3>

No root-knot nematode resistant chile cultivars are commercially available at this time.<P>

<H3>Chemical Control</H3>

The use of pesticides called "nematicides" has been the primary management tool for controlling root-knot nematodes in chile. As with many other crops, the number of nematicides registered for use on chile has declined significantly since the early 1980s. Most of the remaining chile nema-ticides can be broadly categorized as "fumigants."  These materials are liquids that are applied to the soil, where they vaporize and per- colate, killing nematodes. Fumigants must be applied long enough before planting to permit the pesticide to spread through the soil, kill the nematodes and dissipate, because these materials are harmful to most plants. Fumigant effectiveness is affected by soil factors such as texture and organic matter content, and by physical characteristics such as temperature and moisture present in the soil. When applied at recommended rates and under favorable conditions, fumigants normally provide better root-knot nematode control than their nonfumigant counterparts.<P>

<h1>Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus</h1>
<h2>Guide H-242</h2>
<h3>Natalie P. Goldberg, Extension Plant Pathologist</h3>
Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) is an important disease of many different crops grown in temperate and subtropical regions of the world. TSWV is a unique virus in a virus class by itself. The virus has a wide host range, but some of the more common hosts are tomatoes, peppers, celery, lettuce, eggplant, peanuts, pineapple, many legumes, many ornamentals, and many weeds such as field bindweed and curly dock (table 1). This disease is especially damaging in the ornamental and vegetable greenhouse industry.<p>

Symptoms of TSWV are numerous and varied. However, there are two fairly common symptoms for which this disease was named. First, the young leaves turn bronze and subsequently develop numerous small, dark spots. Second, the leaves often droop on the plant, creating a wilt-like appearance. Other symptoms include die-back of the growing tips and dark streaking of the terminal stems. Affected plants may develop a one-sided growth habit or may be stunted completely. Plants that are affected early in the growing season often do not produce any fruit, while those infected after fruit-set produce diseased fruit with striking symptoms, including chlorotic ringspots, raised bumps, uneven ripening, and deformation. Infected plants produce poor quality fruit and reduced yield.<p>
TSWV is transmitted from infected plants to healthy plants by at least nine species of thrips. Thrips are tiny (approximately 1/16th of an inch) winged insects that feed on plants through sucking mouthparts. Thrips transmit the virus in a persistent manner, which means that once the insect has picked up the virus, it is able to transmit the virus for the remainder of its life. The virus is not passed on from adult to egg; however, progeny that develop on infected plants will quickly pick up the virus and be effective disease vectors.<p>
Controlling this disease is difficult. The wide host range, which includes many perennial ornamentals and weeds, enables the virus to successfully overseason from one crop to the next. Additionally, efforts to control the insect vectors in agricultural fields has had little effect on TSWV. This is likely due to the fact that large populations of thrips may fly or be blown into treated fields from non-treated areas nearby.<p>
Controlling thrips is somewhat more effective in greenhouse situations. In greenhouses, however, growers should take care to avoid repeated sprays of similar insecticides, as thrips are able to build up resistance to commonly used insecticides in a relatively short time. Rotating the insecticide class is the best approach to insect control. Control of thrips may be obtained with pyrethroids, carbamates, chlorinated hydrocarbons, organophosphates, and soaps. Insecticides are most effective when applied in the morning, when the thrips are most active and the chance for plant damage is reduced. Pesticide regulations change frequently, so check with your local county extension service for information on available insecticides.<p>
While elimination of disease may not be possible, the incidence and severity of the disease may be reduced by using cultural practices such as starting with virus-free plant material, removing all infected plants (once virused, there is no cure for the diseased plant), controlling weeds, and rotating crops. Some studies also have shown that the use of reflective mulches under plants may help to reduce infection. In greenhouses, it may be possible to greatly reduce the number of thrips entering the greenhouse by covering doors and air intakes with a fine mesh (400 mesh) cloth. Efforts are underway to breed cultivars with good horticultural charasteristics that also exhibit tolerance to the virus.<p>

<h1>Disease Control in Stone Fruits</h1>
<h2>Guide H-302</h2>
<h3>Emroy L. Shannon, Extension Pathologist</h3>

Stone fruits are susceptible to many diseases. Peaches, in particular, are considered to be short-lived in New Mexico. Plums are better adapted and have fewer diseases than other stone fruits. The most common diseases are listed in this guide.<p>

<h4>WINTER INJURY</h4>
	Sharp drops in temperature can freeze trees and cause severe injury. Severely injured trees may die the first year. Others may have chlorotic (yellow) leaves and slowly decline for a few years. In less severe cases, a few twigs may die back.<p>
	Split bark and sunken areas on the southwest side of the trunk indicate "southwest injury." "Southwest injury" is frequently a problem when sap starts to flow during warm winter days followed by sudden drops in temperature.<p>
	Healthy trees in a proper dormant condition can withstand low temperatures. However, if a tree makes excessive vegetative growth late into the fall, proper hardening of tissues does not take place.<p>
	Plants overfed with nitrogen fertilizer and those receiving heavy early-fall irrigations are most likely to be injured.<p>
	A fungus (Cytospora sp.) frequently invades the bark tissue following winter injury. The disease condition is called Cytospora canker. Small, black, pinhead-size fruiting structures of the fungus often appear within cankers on the trunk and branches. Control this fungus by preventing winter injury.<p>
<b>Control:</b><br>
	Prevent winter injury by painting the southwest side of trunks and larger limbs with light-colored latex paint or whitewash.  Other protective measures include wrapping trunks with burlap strips, aluminum foil, or commercial materials. Newly planted trees especially need protection. Prune badly damaged limbs. Fertilize and water to stimulate additional growth, but withhold nitrogen fertilizers after July 1 to prevent vigorous growth late in the fall. Soil applications of fertilizer, especially nitrogen, should be made in the winter or early spring.  During September, reduce or halt irrigations. After the trees become dormant, a heavy irrigation can then be applied to provide a favorable condition for the roots during the winter.<p>
	Prune weak and dying branches as they appear.<p>
<h4>"DIE-BACK"</h4>
	Limbs may die back as the result of poor growing conditions, winter injury, crown gall, nematodes, bacterial canker, or other diseases.<p>
<b>Control:</b><br>
	Growers should correct fertilization and watering, if necessary. Prune weak and dying branches.<p>
<h4>BACTERIAL CANKER</h4>
	This bacterial disease (Pseudomonas syringae) is chiefly a disease of young trees. The most noticeable symptom is the occurrence of swollen, puffy areas that often exude gum on the trunk and branches. Leaf blight occurs when branches are girdled.  Cankers develop in the winter and early spring. As the tree begins growth in the spring the bacteria die out, and a callus layer is formed around the edge of the canker. Gumming should not be considered a diagnostic characteristic of this disease, because stone-fruit trees exude gum from many other causes. Diseased limbs should be pruned when discovered. A Bordeaux spray (5-5-50) is reported to reduce infection, if applied in the fall when leaves begin to drop and again in early spring before leaves appear.<p>
<h4>"GUMMING"</h4>
	Disease organisms such as the one causing bacterial canker can cause gumming. Large masses of gum frequently exude from buds, twigs, branches, trunks and even fruit.  Other causes include: mechanical injury, winter injury, insect damage, crown gall, and improper growing conditions.<p>
<b>Control:</b><br>
	No special controls may be needed; however, growers should examine their cultural practices and  correct them when needed. Prune any weak or dying branches.<p>
<h4>NEMATODES</h4>
	Nematodes are microscopic, non-segmented worms that often cause damage by feeding on roots. Several species of nematodes are known to be parasitic on stone fruit tree roots. Above-ground symptoms include stunting and wilting. Roots infected with root-knot nematodes have obvious swelling or galls as small as a pinhead to large as a thumb.  Root-knot nematodes are more troublesome in sandy soils. Roots infected with other species of nematodes turn brown or black and are decayed or have dark lesions.<p>
<b>Control:</b><br>
	Before planting, treat soil with a nematicide such as Telone. If nematodes are a problem after planting an orchard, treat with Nemacur 15% Granular using label directions. Do not apply within 15 days of harvest.  Home gardeners can treat the soil (before planting) with SMDC (Vapam, Busan 1020) which also controls soil-borne fungi and weed seeds.<p>
	Purchase trees that have been grafted to nematode-resistant rootstock.<p>
<h4>CROWN GALL</h4>
	You can recognize this disease mostly by the rough-surfaced galls formed on the roots or at the base of the tree.  Above-ground symptoms of diseased trees include gradual decline and general unthriftiness. Most diseased trees will eventually die, but some will live for several years. Some trees may produce excessive amounts of gum on the trunk and branches.<p>
<b>Control:</b><br>
	Inspect all nursery stock on arrival for knots at the crown area.  Destroy infected plants. <p>
	Remove and burn stumps and roots of old infected trees and leave soil idle for two or three years before replanting.<p>
	Use care in planting trees, avoiding injury to the bark around the crown because bacteria in the soil can enter such injuries.<p>
	Nurserymen can reduce spread of disease by dipping grafting and pruning tools regularly in a 10-percent household chlorine bleach solution.<p>

<h4>LEAF SCORCH</h4>
	Several things can cause the margins of leaves to turn brown and die—late frost, hot dry winds, soils high in calcium and sodium salts, excessive fertilizer, lack of water, misuse of herbicides, and various diseases.<p>
<b>Control:</b><br>
	Severe leaf scorch can usually be avoided with good management practices. Make sure trees get enough water during hot, dry periods.<p>
<h4>LEAF SPOT DISEASES</h4>
	Causes of leaf spot and "shot-holes" in leaves are many. They include nitrogen deficiency, spray burn, virus, bacterial disease, and fungus diseases.<p>
<b>Bacterial Leaf Spot </b><i>(Xanthomonas pruni)</i><p>
	Small dead spots on leaves that fall out may be the result of bacterial leaf spot.  Small scabby areas may also appear on fruit.  The disease organism overwinters in cankers produced in twigs or branches. High rainfall and high humidity is needed for severe infection. Special control practices are usually not needed because the disease is rarely seen. Prune out weak branches and fertilize and water properly to produce a vigorous growing tree.<p>
<b>Coryneum Blight </b><i>(Coryneum beijerinckii)</i><p>
	This fungus disease, also known as "shot-hole", occurs only after periods of high rainfall and high humidity. The fungus attacks buds, leaves and fruit. Growers first notice it as small red or purple spots with white centers on leaves and fruit. These spots may enlarge from the size of a pin head up to 0.5 inch in diameter. Peach, apricot, and sweet cherries are susceptible. The fungus overwinters in cankers on twigs and branches.<p>
<b>Control:</b><br>
	Special controls are usually not needed. Prune diseased branches as they appear. Various copper compounds (Bordeaux mixture, Kocide 101, etc.) have been reported to be helpful in controlling the disease when applied as a dormant spray. Captan and chlorothalonil (Bravo) will also help control the disease if applied just after blossom drop (shuck fall) and as a post harvest spray.<p>
<b>Ring Spot Virus</b><p>
	Small ring-like spots or chlorotic spots are commonly found on leaves of stone fruits. The tissue within these spots usually dies and falls out giving the leaf a shot-hole appearance. Growers frequently blame insects or various disease organisms for the shot-like appearance. Losses from this virus in New Mexico have never been evaluated. It causes no obvious losses, especially in home gardens. Commercial growers and home gardeners should select virus-free trees if available. Viruses cannot be eradicated from a tree after infection.<p>
<h4>VIRUS DISEASES</h4>
	Stone fruits are susceptible to many virus diseases. In fact, there are over 50 virus diseases reported on stone fruits in North America. Symptoms of virus diseases vary with the variety or species of tree, differences in root stock, and the particular virus or strain involved. Foliage symptoms may include green and yellow mottling, mosaic ringspots, and severe yellowing. Leaves are sometimes small and often rolled or twisted. Fruit is often sparse, off-color, and flavorless. Trees are often stunted, lack vigor, and may die quite rapidly. Some diseased trees live for years. Some trees may become infected but show no symptoms; however, they can become a source of infection for other trees.<p>
	Where possible, destroy all wild cherries, plums, peaches, and other wild Prunus spp. within a half mile or further. Plant only certified, virus-free trees from a reputable nursery. Control insects, especially leafhoppers, that transmit the viruses.<p>
	Peach mosaic has caused considerable damage to peach crops in previous years. Its importance now is less because of eradication programs. This disease is spread to healthy peach trees by buds or grafts from infected trees and by a microscopic Eriophyid mite. Symptoms include mottling that crosses the veins, rough, bumpy fruit; retarded development of foliage; and shortened internodes (spaces between stems). Flowers are often streaked and spotted. Some symptoms of peach mosaic are much like those described for zinc deficiency. Zinc-deficient trees grow normally when treated with zinc, but peach mosaic-infected trees do not recover. The only practical means of controlling peach mosaic is to remove diseased trees as symptoms appear.<p>
<h4>NUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES</h4>
	The most common deficiency diseases in the state are those caused by a lack of nitrogen, iron, and zinc. Trees fail to grow properly when these nutrients are deficient or are in forms the plants cannot use.<p>
<b>Nitrogen Deficiency</b><p>
	The leaves of nitrogen-deficient trees are smaller than normal and pale green. The shoots are frequently shorter and the bark may have a reddish tinge. On peach, severe deficiency causes reddish leaves. Dead spots may appear on peach leaves and fall out, causing a "shot hole" condition. Growth is restricted, fruit size is reduced, and production is poor. Fruit color, however, is enhanced.<p>
	Correct nitrogen deficiency by applying 0.25 pound of actual nitrogen per inch of trunk diameter. Another rule of thumb is to apply 1 pound of ammonium sulfate (21 percent nitrogen) per inch of trunk diameter. Apply one half of the recommended rate before or at bud break and the other half in late May or June. Do not fertilize after July 1 to avoid possible freeze injury as a result of stimulated growth.<p>
<b>Iron Deficiency (Chlorosis)</b><p>
	The most pronounced symptom of iron deficiency is the lack of chlorophyll in leaves. Very often, the veins are white or yellow. Newly formed leaves are generally more chlorotic than older ones.<p>
	Iron deficiency occurs in trees growing on alkaline soils and is usually more severe when too much water has been applied or when soil aeration is poor because of a high water table or a tight subsoil.<p>
	Correct iron deficiency symptoms by spraying trees with iron chelates using label directions. Apply early in the season because older leaves will not absorb iron compounds. Do not apply severe amounts of iron to the foliage, as it will cause severe leaf drop. Iron chelates can also be applied to the soil early in the season, as the label directs.<p>
<b>Zinc Deficiency</b><p>
	Zinc deficiency is frequently a problem where soils are alkaline and in sandy areas. Heavy applications of manure can also encourage zinc-deficiency symptoms. Small, bunched leaves that form at the ends of branches are a typical symptom of zinc deficiency. Yellowing of the leaves is also a sign of zinc deficiency. On slightly deficient trees, leaves may be partly yellow but normal in size. On very deficient trees, leaves are completely yellow, dwarfed and narrower than normal.  Fruit is sometimes misshapen.<p>
	Zinc deficiency can be corrected by spraying trees two to three times early in the year with zinc chelates or NZN. Soil treatments with zinc chelates sometimes are not successful because of highly alkaline soils.<p>
<h4>FRUIT ROTS</h4>
	Various fungi (molds) can cause fruit to rot on the tree and during shipping and storage. Brown rot caused by the fungus Monilinia fructicola and Rhizopus rot caused by Rhizopus nigricans have caused losses during some years. Brown rot is recognized by the ash-gray tufts of fungus growth on the fruit and is encouraged by wet, humid conditions when the fruit is almost mature.<p>
	Fruit rots can be reduced by spraying with sulfur (not on apricot), Benlate or Captan using lable directions. An application just before fruit maturity would be especially helpful. They can be applied up to the day of harvest. <p>
<b>Control:</b><br>
	Fruit rots can be kept at a minimum if the fruit is harvested at optimum maturity, and if it is handled carefully to prevent bruises and other injuries. Fruit should be placed in cold storage as soon as possible after harvest.<p>
	Fruit rots can be reduced by spraying with sulfur (Not on apricot) Benlate, or Captan using label directions. An application just before fruit maturity would be especially helpful. They can be applied up to the day of harvest.<p>
	Captan can be used as a post-harvest dip on apricots, cherries, nectarines, and peaches. Packing boxes can also be sprayed with a solution of Captan as an added precaution.<p>
	Benlate can be used as a spray or dip after harvest. Benlate does not control Rhizopus rot. Follow label directions for rates of application and safety precautions.<p>
<h4>POWDERY MILDEW</h4>
	Powdery mildew is frequently found on sweet cherries following periods of rainfall and high humidity. This fungus is recognized by the white mold it produces on the surface of leaves and, in severe cases, on the fruit.<p>
<b>Control:</b><br>
	Control practices are usually not needed, but when the disease continues to spread spray foliage with Benlate or sulfur during periods of high humidity.<p>
<h4>COLLAR ROT</h4>
	This soil-borne fungus disease can become important in heavy clay soils and in areas with a high water table. Affected trees wilt and appear to be suffering from a lack of water. Leaves are sparse and lighter colored than normal.  The trunk area at or just below the ground level becomes rotted.  The tree dies when sufficient water and nutrients cannot pass through the rotted area. Prevent the disease by planting trees in a well-drained site. One-half of the top growth should be pruned when the disease is first observed. Use of Ridomil 2E will aid in the control of crown, collar and root rot caused by Phytophthora spp. when used in conjunction with good cultural practices and rootstocks that are most tolerant to the disease. Ridomil 2E applications should be made before symptoms appear, especially in areas favorable for disease development. Ridomil 2E will not revitalize trees showing moderate to severe disease symptoms.<p>
On new plantings, make the first application of Ridomil 2E two weeks after planting. Additional applications should be made at 2-3 month intervals or during periods most favorable for root, crown or collar rot development.<p>
For established plantings, the application should be made in the spring before the plants start growth. Additional applications should be made at 2-3 month intervals or to coincide with periods most favorable for root, crown or collar rot development. Be sure to check the label for other recommendations.<p>
<h4>INCOMPATIBILITY</h4>
	This disorder appears to be restricted to the Van variety when it is grafted to Maheleb rootstock.  The most common symptom of this abnormality is sparse foliage that severely wilts about harvest time. Losses are especially apparent during years of heavy fruit production.  Trees usually die the second or third year after symptoms of wilting and sparse foliage are observed. Close examination of the trunk just below the ground level reveals decayed bark tissue that resembles the collar rot disease previously described. Roots are also decayed.<p>
<b>Control:</b><br>
	When purchasing the Van variety, make  sure it is grafted to Mazzard rootstock (Not Maheleb).<p>
<h4>ROOT ROT</h4>
	A soil-borne fungus disease called cotton root rot, Texas root rot, Phymatotrichum root rot, or simply root rot is a problem in a few orchards in southern New Mexico at elevations below 5,000 feet. It is not a problem in the northern part of the state. Sudden wilting and drying of foliage are usually the first signs of the disease. Examination reveals rotted roots.<p>
<b>Control:</b><br>
	Control of this disease is very difficult in established orchards. Avoid planting trees on virgin land or where cotton, alfalfa, or other plants have shown symptoms of this disease.<p>
<i>Treatment of Diseased Trees.</i> Trees can often be saved if one-half or more of the top growth is pruned when symptoms first appear. Then treat the soil with sulfur, ammonium sulfate, and manure, as follows: 
1) Loosen soil around affected trees out to the drip line of the branches. 2) Cover ground to a depth of two inches with manure. Other forms of organic matter, such as moldy hay, may be substituted for manure. 3) On the surface of that, scatter ammonium sulfate or equivalent, at the rate of 1 pound to 10 square feet. Add the same amount of soil sulfur on top of the ammonium sulfate. A circle 12 feet in diameter (suitable for a tree 6 or 8 inches in diameter) would require 11 pounds of ammonium sulfate and 11 pounds of soil sulfur. Nitrate fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate should not be used where root rot is a problem. Make sure that trees get adequate water. This treatment must be started as soon as symptoms are first noticed. Some trees may not recover even though this treatment is used.<p>
<i>Treatment at Planting Time.</i> Disease incidence can be minimized in an orchard by treating each planting hole with manure, soil sulfur, and ammonium sulfate. Treat as follows: 1) Dig a broad and comparatively shallow hole. 2) Distribute a generous amount of manure (up to one-fifth by volume). 3) Apply soil sulfur at the rate of 0.25 pound per cubic foot of tree holes. 4) Apply ammonium sulfate (21 percent nitrogen) or equivalent, at the rate of one ounce per cubic foot. A round planting hole 4 feet in diameter and 2.5 feet deep has 30 cubic feet. (It should be treated with 6 cubic feet of manure, 7.5 pounds of sulfur, and 1.75 pounds of ammonium sulfate.)<p>
	For good distribution of the materials without the extra labor of mixing them, place them in thin layers alternating with layers of soil as follows: First, place about 2 inches of manure or organic matter in the hole.  On this, scatter two handfuls of sulfur and one of ammonium sulfate. Cover with 3 inches of soil and repeat layers until hole is filled to 6 inches from the top. Flood the hole to settle the soil.  Plant when soil is no longer muddy. If time permits, prepare tree holes 30 to 60 days before planting time.  In planting bare-rooted trees, be sure no manure or fertilizer is in contact with the roots. Use plain soil (there will be a surplus pile by each hole) for 2 or 3 inches where you are going to set the new trees and cover roots with the same untreated soil. Manure can be used in finishing the refilling and in the basin as long as it does not come in direct contact with roots.<p>
	Water after planting, then water frequently and lightly until trees are well established.<p>
<i>Treatment of Sites Where Trees Have Died.</i> Where trees have died from the fungus, treat replant sites with SMDC (Vapam, Busan 1010)<p>
<b>Caution:</b><br>
	Do not apply SMDC within 3 feet of the drip line of living plants, shrubs, or trees. Do not apply to dry soil, as it will be ineffective. Material should not be allowed to contact skin or eyes. Do not breathe fumes. Contaminated clothing should be removed and laundered. Follow label directions.<p>

<h4>FOUR KEYS TO PESTICIDE SAFETY</h4>

Read the label on each pesticide container before each use.  Follow instructions:  heed all cautions and warnings.  The chemical nature of pesticides and their uses vary greatly.  refresh your mind each time on the material's specific uses.<p>

Store pesticides in their original, labeled containers.  They cannot be properly identified unless they are in original labeled containers.  Lock pesticides in a shed away from feed, seed, and other farm supplies.  Keep them out of the reach of children and irresponsible people.<p>

Apply pesticides only as directed.  Apply them to the crops specified, in amounts specified, and at times specified in label instruction, or by your agricultural authorities.<p>

Dispose of empty containers safely.  It is almost impossible to remove all material from a container.  "Empty" containers contain small amounts of pesticides which could harm children or animals who might get into them.  It is best to dispose of empty containers by burying them at least 18 inches deep in an isolated area provided for this purpose away from water supplies.<p>

<i>Use Pesticides Safely</i>--Follow the label.<br>

<h1>Pruning Grapes to the Four-Arm Kniffin System</h1>
<h2>Guide H-303</h2>
<h3>Reviewed by ã Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</h3>


Pruning is the systematic removal of wood in a manner that will result in a strong vine of convenient shape and good crops of large clusters. No operation influences grape production more than pruning. Excessive pruning produces vigorous vegetative growth and low yield, however clusters and berries will be large. Too little pruning produces weak growth and an excessive set of fruit resulting in small clusters, small berries, and poor quality. The grower must maintain his vines between an under-vegetative and over-vegetative condition so as to obtain the maximum in both yield and quality.<p>
To prune grapes properly, you must know certain facts about their fruiting habits. Grape clusters are borne on shoots which arise from one-year old canes. These fruiting shoots are developed from the first four to ten buds on the basal section of last year's canes. Remove all canes that produced last year. Select four to six strong, well located one-year old fruiting branches. Cut these back so as to leave a total of 30 to 50 buds, depending upon the vigor of the plant. Leave three or four two-bud spurs near the trunk to produce branches that will become next year's fruiting wood. Remove all other branches. All pruning should be done during the dormant season, preferably in late winter, but before the buds begin to swell. Canes pruned in late winter or early spring may "bleed" some, but this is not harmful.<p>
At the time of planting, cut the vine back to two buds. Immediately prior to the second growing season, tie the best cane to a stake. This cane will become the trunk; remove all others at the crown. The four-arm Kniffin system of training is most generally used in French-hybrid varieties planted in northern New Mexico. Tie the central cane to the wire with cloth strips or "plant ties." During the second and third dormant seasons, select four branch canes to serve as arms, one each direction on both wires. You have completed the development of the framework and future pruning will be solely to control plant size, production, and quality.<p>

<TITLE>Why Fruit Trees Fail to Bear</TITLE>
</head>
<body BGCOLOR="#ffffff" text="#000000" link="#0000c0" vlink="#000090"><img src="/cahe/images/pr.gif" height=100 width=129 align=right alt="NMSU College of Agriculture & Home Economics">
<h1>Why Fruit Trees Fail to Bear</H1>
<H2>Guide H-308</H2>

<H3>Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist <BR>
Darrell Sullivan, Professor of Horticulture</H3>

This publication is scheduled to be updated and reissued 8/99.<P>

Fruit trees normally begin to bear fruit soon after they are old enough to flower. Nevertheless, the health of the tree, its environment, its fruiting habits, and the cultural practices you use influence its ability to produce fruit. Adequate pollination is essential to fruit yield.<P>

One unfavorable condition may reduce yields or prevent the bearing of any fruit. You can control some of the factors contributing to fruit production.<P>


<H3>Bearing Age</H3>

Most fruit trees are propagated by grafting or budding the variety on a root stock. When you purchase nursery-grown trees, their tops will be one to two years old while the roots may be one or two years older. The age (from planting) when trees can be expected to bear fruit depends on the type of fruit you are growing: apple, apricot and sour cherry (three to five years), peach (two to four), pear and plum (four to six), quince and sweet cherry (five to seven). Dwarf fruit trees may begin to bear one to two years earlier than standard sized trees.<P>

<H3>Tree Health</H3>

Trees must be healthy to produce good quality fruit. Weak or diseased trees produce either poor quality fruit or no fruit at all. The first step is to keep trees free from insects and diseases.<P>

<H3>Climate and Weather</H3>

Flowers and young fruits of trees in New Mexico frequently are injured by late spring frosts. Injured flowers may appear to be normal, but if the pistils (center parts of the flower) are killed no fruit will be produced.<P>

Time of bloom varies with species. The earliest to bloom is the almond, followed by Japanese plums and apricots. Peaches are next, followed by sweet cherries, pears, European plums, sour cherries, and apples. Varieties also vary in time of flowering. Make your selections from varieties that are late blooming and that are recommended for New Mexico.<P>

In some areas, although the tree may grow, fruit may not mature because the frost-free season is not long enough. Most commercial pecan varieties can only be grown in southern New Mexico. Pecan varieties grown in the northern part of the U.S., such as 'Major' and 'Peruque', may be better adapted to northern New Mexico.<P>

<H3>Pollination</H3>

Flowers of fruit trees must be pollinated to produce fruit. Without sufficient pollination, they may blossom abundantly but will not bear fruit.<P>
Varieties that bear fruit from pollination among their own flowers are said to be "self fruitful." However, many varieties cannot produce fruit from their own pollen. Those requiring pollen from another variety are called "self unfruitful."  Some trees. like pecans, have separate male and female flowers on the same tree. If the male pollen is shed before the female flower is receptive, fruit-set becomes a problem.<P>

Some species of fruit trees do not fit conveniently into either category. Pistachios have male trees that produce pollen and female trees that produce fruit. To grow them successfully, it is necessary to plant at least one male tree for every eight female pistachio trees.<P>

Most apple trees are self unfruitful. Plant at least two varieties near one another. 'Golden Delicious', a self fruitful variety, and 'Jonathan' are the most common pollinators used.<P>

In general, a pollinator should be considered for all pear varieties, even though 'Kieffer' and 'Duchess' set good crops without pollinators. Most pear varieties, especially 'Bartlett', are susceptible to fireblight disease; 'Moon Glow' and 'Kieffer Starking Delicious' are resistant.<P>

Most peach varieties are self fruitful. However, if you are planting 'J. H. Hale', 'Stark Honeydew Hale', or 'Stark Hale Berta Giant', you need to plant another variety to assure adequate pollination.<P>

The lack of fuzz on the fruit is the main difference between a nectarine and a peach. Nectarines are usually smaller and have a distinctive sub-acid flavor. Nectarines do not need pollinators. Nectarine flowers are more susceptible to frost injury than peaches and the fruit is frequently scarred from injury by insects.<P>

Leading varieties of apricot trees are self fruitful. However,  a  pollinator  will increase production. 'Goldrich' and 'Perfection' varieties must be pollinated to bear fruit.
Japanese plums bloom earlier than European plums, and for this reason they will not usually pollinate each other. 'Stanley', the number one European type, is self fruitful. 'Bluefre' and 'Stanley' are the most common pollinizers for European plums. 'Redheart' is one of the best pollinators for Japanese plums. 'Santa Rosa', one of the most widely planted Japanese plum, and 'Methley' are self fruitful.<P>

With the exception of 'Stella' and 'Compact Stella', all sweet cherries need a pollinator to bear well. As a general rule of thumb, dark colored varieties will pollinate dark varieties, and light colored varieties are recommended to pollinate other light ones.<P>

Most sour (pie) cherries bear heavily without a pollinator. They are hardier and bloom later than the sweet cherries.<P>

Occasionally, fruit trees bear heavily one year and sparsely the next. This is called "biennial bearing."  The spring-flowering buds of most hardy fruit trees are formed during the previous spring or summer. Therefore, an especially heavy crop one year may prevent adequate bud formation for the following year or may seriously weaken the tree.<P>

Biennial bearing of apples is difficult to alter or correct. Sometimes by chemical or hand thinning, when fruit-set is extra heavy, you can induce a return to normal yearly fruit production. Thinning should be done early, soon after fruit-set, before flower buds for next season are initiated. Thin fruits to approximately three to five inches apart.<P>

<H3>Cultural Practices</H3>

Fruit trees need good cultural practices during the season to maintain an adequate number of good leaves for quality fruit production. About 30 to 40 good-sized, healthy leaves are needed to produce one good-quality apple.<P>

Trees need full sunlight for best production. Inadequate sunlight delays the beginning of fruit bearing and may reduce the amount of fruit. Avoid placing fruit trees where they will be shaded by buildings or by other trees.<P>

Your trees will grow more vigorously and bear better if they have adequate space to develop their root systems. Do not plant them where roots of forest or shade trees will compete with them. To reduce competition from weeds or grass, cultivate, mulch, or apply weed killer.<P>

Prune young trees to train them to systems suitable for the species. Strong branches are needed to support the weight of a heavy crop. Severe pruning may stimulate excessive upright growth, which delays flower production and reduces yields.<P>

<TITLE>Grape Cultivars for North-Central New Mexico</title>

<h1>Grape Cultivars for North-Central New Mexico</h1>
<h2>Guide H-309</h2>
<h3>Frank B. Matta, Assistant Professor of Horticulture<br>
Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist<br>
Darrell Sullivan, Professor of Horticulture</h3>

Grapes are widely grown in home gardens for fruit and landscape purposes or commercially for wine, raisins, or fresh consumption. Grapes, on a commercial  scale,  are the world's most widely grown deciduous fruit crop. Selection of cultivars adapted  to  prevailing  climatic  conditions  in  a particular area is an important step.<p>


<h3>TYPES OF GRAPES</h3>

Four types of grapes may be grown in New Mexico.<p>

<b>European Grapes</b><br>
<i>Vitis vinifera</i>, developed mostly in France, are excellent for wine or table use. These grapes require long, warm, dry summers and moderate winter temperatures. Grow them only in southern New Mexico.<p>

<b>American Grapes</b><br>
<i>Vitis labrusca </i>are used mainly for juice. These grapes are more cold hardy and more resistant to some disease and insect pests than European grapes. They may show some leaf chlorosis (yellowing).<p>

<b>American Hybrids</b><br>
These hybrids are produced by crosses between the American  and  European  types.  American  and American hybrids are better adapted to acid soils; therefore, many tend to suffer from iron deficiency (yellowing of leaves) when grown on alkaline soils.<p>

<b>French Hybrids</b><br>
Crosses between the European and wild-American grape. Some cultivars produce good wine while others are acceptable as table grapes. Hybrid types, in general, are intermediate in winter hardiness between American and European species.<p>
Most European varieties are not winter hardy. Varieties such as 'Black Monukka', 'Cabernet Sauvignon',  'Emerald  Riesling',  'Pinot Chardonnay', 'Thompson Seedless', and 'White Riesling' failed to survive winter conditions or had poor plant vigor in northern New Mexico.<p>
American varieties are usually sensitive to high pH, which is shown by iron deficiency (leaf yellowing). 'Concord'  being  the  most  sensitive  'Fredonia', 'Niagara,' and 'Westfield' cultivars have performed better in northern New Mexico.<p>


<h3>CULTIVAR DESCRIPTIONS</h3>

American  and  French  hybrids  appear  better adapted to the northern New Mexico climate than European or American species. Following are descriptions of some American and French hybrid cultivars that have performed acceptably in north-central New Mexico.<p>

<h1>Fruit Species and Varieties for Home Orchards</H1>
<H2>Guide H-310</H2>
<H3>Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</H3>


Many fruit species are not adapted to New Mexico's climate and soil conditions. Late spring frosts occur frequently in all areas of the state, injuring flowers and young fruits of early flowering species. In the north and at high altitudes minimum winter temperatures limit the species that can be successfully planted. Low relative humidity and drying winds may desiccate plants. The life expectancy of many trees is limited by exposure to high light intensity. Soils, in general, are alkaline, resulting in mineral element deficiencies. Both soil and irrigation water may be high in soluble salts.<P>

The following discussion covers some problems likely to be encountered with various species, areas of adaptation, and a number of recommended varieties. Others may perform equally as well, and the performance of a given variety may be better in protected areas around homes than in commercial plantings.<P>

<H3>Almonds</H3>

Almonds are the first fruit species to flower in the spring and consequently produce crops infrequently. They should be planted only in the south. Recommended varieties are 'Mission' (Texas), 'Titan,' and 'All-in-One,' a semi-dwarf variety. In the southern areas these trees are usually long-lived and are attractive small shade trees.<P>

<H3>Apricots</H3>

These trees are adapted to alkaline soils, and usually mineral element deficiencies are not a problem. Trees are relatively long-lived. They have attractive leaves and are useful as small shade trees. Apricots flower after almonds but early enough to be injured frequently by late spring frosts. Young fruits seem to be more susceptible to frost injury than almonds, plums or peaches. Full crops occur in southern areas about one in five years and less frequently in colder areas. 'Tilton' and 'Sun Glo' flower slightly later than many other varieties.<P>

<H3>Plums</H3>

Japanese plums flower about the same time as apricots, but young fruits are a little more cold tolerant, and production is more reliable in all areas of the state. Most varieties need cross pollination (two different varieties need to be planted). 'Methley' is self-fruitful and more frost tolerant than most varieties. Other tolerant varieties are 'Santa Rosa' and 'Satsuma'. Two hybrids that are reliable are 'Gold' and 'Sepa'. Japanese plums are short-lived and frequently chlorotic (iron deficient) in New Mexico.<P>

European plums flower later than Japanese type and frequently escape frost injury. They are recommended for northern and high altitudes. In general, performance has been poor in the south. Recommended varieties are 'Italian' and 'Stanley' (prune plums), 'Damson' and 'Edwards'.<P>

<H3>Peaches</H3>

Peach trees are short-lived in all areas of New Mexico with an average life of 10 years. Painting the trunks with exterior white latex paint to reflect the winter sun reduces sun scald and prolongs life. Annual pruning, to promote compact trees, protects the main branches from burning. Zinc deficiency may be a problem, especially on sandy soils. Peaches flower about two weeks before apples. Full crops should be expected one year in four or five. Three late blooming varieties are: 'Redhaven', 'Dixie Red' and 'Raritan Rose' (white fleshed). 'Rio-Oso-Gem', 'Glohaven' and 'Sullivans Elberta' are recommended. 'Regular Elberta' is very susceptible to frost injury.<P>

<H3>Cherries</H3>
Both sweet and sour cherry trees are short-lived and perform poorly in hot southern areas. They are recommended only for cooler areas. Sweet cherries flower early and may be injured by frosts. 'Bing', 'Black Tartarian' and 'Lambert' are suggested for trial. 'Bing' and 'Lambert' require cross pollination.<P>

Sour cherries flower late and frequently escape spring frosts. 'Montmorency' is the main variety. In southern areas try 'Meteor' (semi-dwarf) and 'North Star' (dwarf). Most varieties need no pollinators.<P>

<H3>Apples and Pears</H3>

Both species require numerous scheduled sprayings to control worms and other pests. Pears flower after peaches and before apples. Pears are adapted to all areas, but production is better in the south. 'Bartlett' is the leading variety. 'Duchess' and 'Eldorado' are also good. 'Kieffer Starking Delicious' and 'Moonglow' are fire blight resistant. Pear varieties on dwarfing rootstocks are recommended over standard trees.<P>

Although apple trees flower later than most fruit species, late spring frost injury occurs frequently in all areas except in the south. 'Rome' is late flowering. 'Golden Delicious' flowers and fruits are slightly more frost tolerant than other varieties. 'Rome' is not recommended for warmer areas of the state. 'Arkansas Black' (a late maturing variety), 'Jonathan' and 'Winesap' develop good red color in the southern area. Most commercial varieties are adapted to higher altitudes. Semidwarf and dwarf trees bear sooner and are easier to manage than standard trees. Plant only improved earlier-coloring strains of these varieties.<P>

<H3>Grapes</H3>

There are three main species or types of grapes that will grow in New Mexico. European (California) varieties are not entirely winter-hardy in New Mexico and should be planted only in southern areas, unless winter protection is given. American varieties are cold tolerant, but some, such as 'Concord', are chlorotic in alkaline soil. French hybrids, in general, are intermediate in winter hardiness. Varieties suggested are:<P>

<I>European Table Varieties</I> - 'Thompson Seedless' and 'Black Monukka' (seedless). Others that may produce well are 'White Malaga', 'Red Malaga', 'Cardinal', 'Gold', 'Thomascat' (seedless) and 'Queen'.<P>

<I>Wine Varieties</I> - 'Zinfandel', 'Grenache', 'Emerald Riesling', ' French Colombard' and 'Palomino'.<P>

<I>American Varieties</I> - 'Golden Muscat', 'Niagara', 'Fredonia' and 'Westfield'.<P>

<I>French Hybrids</I> - 'Vidal Blanc', 'Rougeon', 'Chancellor', 'Cascade' and 'Baco Noir'.<P>

<H3>Berries</H3>

Bramble fruits (blackberries and raspberries) and strawberries are difficult to grow in the warmer areas of New Mexico. Production is poor, and it is difficult to maintain fruiting wood on bramble. Everbearing strawberries may be grown on raised beds in partial shade with mulch and with frequent irrigations. The 'Boysenberry' is the best of the brambles. Black currents, grown with protection from afternoon sun, are sometimes profitable. Growing berries is usually more successful at higher altitudes.<P>

<H3>Figs</H3>

The fig continues growth late in the fall and frequently the entire aboveground parts winter kill. It is recommended only for the southern areas. Irrigate less frequently in late summer so the plants will attain hardiness before cold weather. Varieties include 'Celeste', 'Mission', and 'Brown Turkey'.<P>

<H3>Pecans and Walnuts</H3>

For the southern area of the state, western pecan varieties such as 'Western Schley', 'Wichita' and 'Burkett' are recommended. In other areas early maturing varieties should be planted. In the middle Rio Grande Valley and from Roswell north to Tucumcari 'Stuart' and 'San Saba' may succeed. For areas with shorter seasons only northern varieties such as 'Peruque', 'Major' and 'Posey' should be planted.<P>

English walnut trees are less winter hardy than pecans. Trees of hardier strains, called Carpathian walnuts, may survive temperatures as low as -40 degrees F. However, they flower earlier than pecans and may be damaged by spring frosts. Walnut leaves are more susceptible to salt injury. 'Mesa' variety has produced consistently, and the tree has survived -20 degrees F in the Mesilla Valley. Named varieties, such as 'Colby' and 'Lake', rather than seedling trees, should be planted.<P>

<h1>Apple Disease Control</h1>
<h2>Guide H-317</h2>
<h3>Natalie P. Goldberg, Extension Plant Pathologist</h3>

Several infectious disease agents (biotic pathogens such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, nematodes, and mycoplasmas) and non-infectious factors (abiotic factors such as temperature, moisture, nutrients, soil conditions, and chemicals) can cause diseases on apple trees. The climate in New Mexico tends to limit the common types of diseases; however, the diseases that do occur can be serious.<P>

Disease severity is dependent on the susceptibility of the host, the aggressiveness of the pathogen, and the environment. Cultural management of the host also plays an important role in the severity of disease. Factors influencing the susceptibility of the apple trees include genetic tolerance, tree maturity, vigor (degree of stress), and planting density. Most infectious microorganisms go through a life cycle that includes a period of dormancy. During this period, the organism cannot cause disease. When the pathogen is not dormant, other factors such as its natural state of virulence (aggressiveness) and population density will influence disease severity. Environmental conditions play a key role in disease outbreaks. Disease is most severe when the environment is ideal for infection and disease development.<P>

Diseased trees will produce a variety of symptoms, depending on which part of the tree is attacked (table 1).<P>

<h3>Table 1. Symptom expression in diseased apple trees.</h3>

</pre>

Growers should monitor trees frequently for symptoms of disease. Watch for indications of stress such as poor growth, branch or twig dieback, yellowing, and discolored or sunken areas on roots, trunk, branches, leaves, or fruit. This type of monitoring may require scraping bark, digging feeder roots, or removing soil around the crown or lateral roots. Keep good records on all phases of orchard management, including routine monitoring for diseases. Record the date of inspection; disease symptoms and signs; environmental conditions; information on recent irrigation, fertilization and chemical applications; and the presence of pests. Sometimes positive diagnosis of diseased trees is not possible at first inspection. Draw a map of the orchard to keep track of suspect trees, which will allow for easy follow-up inspection of suspect trees.<P>

Seasonal and environmental influences on apple tree diseases is great. Some pathogens are only active at certain times of the year. Diseases caused by these organisms are highly dependent on the environment and somewhat less dependent on the degree of host stress. For example, most diseases that affect the flowers, fruit, and leaves are triggered by excess moisture, so the diseases cause problems in the spring during periods of rain, fog, and heavy dew. Some pathogens attack tree roots in the fall; however, symptoms are not visible until the spring when the actively growing tree is unable to take up sufficient water and nutrients. Some pathogens weaken plants year round. These diseases are less dependent on the environment and more dependent on degree of host stress.<P>

The primary goals of a disease management program are to prevent disease outbreaks and to reduce the impact of plant diseases. Often the best approach is to attack the problem by manipulating the plant and its environment. Many pathogens establish themselves slowly over years. Once disease symptoms appear, management options become limited; therefore, the key to effective disease management is prevention. Disease management strategies also must be cost effective.<P>

Disease management begins before the trees are planted. Selecting proper rootstock and cultivars is important in the overall success of the orchard. In selecting trees, make decisions based on market and cultural considerations, but also take into account soil conditions, climate, and the most likely disease problems.<P>

Soil preparation prior to planting will impact tree health and vigor. Apples require deep, level soil with good drainage. Cultivation and amendment of the soil may be necessary to reduce the impact of compacted soil, hardpans, and poor drainage.<P>

Tree establishment and cultural management of the orchard will also affect the overall health and performance of the trees. Careful water and fertilization management are critical in maintaining healthy, vigorous trees. Other important management considerations include sanitation practices, pruning, thinning, harvesting, and pest control. For more information on orchard management, see New Mexico State University Cooperative Extension Guide H-321.<P>

Controlling diseases in apple orchards is difficult once trees are infected. There are no chemical controls available for many diseases, particularly root and crown rots and cankers. Control of these diseases can only be obtained by careful water management and good sanitation practices. Chemical controls are directed at fungal and bacterial diseases of fruit and foliage. The current climate for pesticide registration makes it difficult to maintain a current listing of available materials. Check current chemical references for registration of available fungicides.<P>

Avoid injuring trees, fruit, and beneficial organisms when using pesticides. Copper compounds used to control fungal diseases may cause russeting on developing fruit. Likewise, sulfur compounds used incorrectly may disrupt the natural control of mite pests by destroying predaceous mites. Always read and follow the product label carefully.<P>

<h2>Common Apple Diseases In New Mexico Orchards</h2>

<h3>Powdery Mildew</h3>

One of the most common diseases in New Mexico apple orchards is powdery mildew, which is caused by the fungus, <I>Podosphaera leucotricha</i>. The disease occurs during periods of high humidity (above 70%) and warm temperatures. Infected trees develop a white, powdery appearance on the underside of the leaves. This powdery growth is mycelium and spores (conidia) of the fungus. As the infection develops, the disease spreads to twigs, flowers, and fruit. Infected leaves curl upward, and infected fruit develops a net-like russeting on the surface. Late in the season tiny black fruiting bodies (cleistothecia) of the fungus may appear on infected leaves and twigs. Severe infection causes stunted trees with reduced vigor, yield, and fruit quality.<P>

Powdery mildew overwinters as fungal strands (mycelium) in buds infected the previous year. The infected terminals may be silvery-gray in color, stunted, and misshapen. When the buds break dormancy, the new leaves and flowers are infected by the fungus. The powdery fungal growth produced on infected tissue consists of thousands of tiny spores, called <I>conidia</i>, which are responsible for secondary spread and infection. Conidia are disseminated throughout the orchard in wind currents and water splashes. High humidity (greater than 70%) and relatively warm temperatures are required for the conidia to germinate. Although spore germination depends on high humidity, they will not germinate in free water. Thus, while the leaf surface is wet, the fungus is not active. When the water evaporates from the plant surface, the humidity in the plant canopy increases and the fungus becomes active. A new batch of conidia are produced 5 days after infection. In favorable conditions, the disease spreads rapidly.<P>

Conidia are the fungus's short-term survival spore. However, they can withstand hot, dry periods for many weeks. Once the disease begins, it is a potential threat throughout the season. This fungus may also produce fruiting bodies, called <i>cleistothecia</i>, which contain ascospores. These spores are protected from the winter climate. Thus, if produced, the fungus has two mechanisms for overwintering, as dormant mycelium in buds and as ascospores. The disease cycle of apple powdery mildew is illustrated in fig. 1 (Not Available).<P>

Management of powdery mildew on apple begins before the orchard is planted by selecting cultivars with some degree of tolerance to the disease. Highly susceptible cultivars include 'Jonathan', 'Rome Beauty', 'Gravenstein', and 'Mutsu' (Crispin). 'Golden Delicious' and 'Granny Smith' are moderately susceptible. Avoid these cultivars in areas with a history of severe powdery mildew problems. No cultivars are completely resistant to infection. Check with tree producers for information regarding the tolerance of individual cultivars.<P>

Additional management practices include good sanitation practices and protective fungicide spray programs. Sanitation programs should include removing fallen leaves and pruning shoots suspected of infection during dormancy or in early spring. This will help to reduce the primary infection and limit the amount of fungus present in the environment. Routine pruning and thinning are also helpful in allowing good air circulation around the trees, reducing humidity and chances for severe disease development.<P>

In orchards where powdery mildew is known to be a problem, a preventative fungicide spray program can be helpful in controlling the disease. Fungicides are most effective when applied at 7- to 10-day intervals from prepink stage through petal fall. In some areas continued sprays may be necessary until terminal growth stops. A number of registered fungicides control powdery mildew on apple. However, pesticide registrations are constantly changing, making it difficult to compile pesticide lists that will stand up over time. Check with your local county extension service or chemical representative for product availability. Always be sure to read the current label before using any pesticide.<P>

<h3>Phytophthora Crown, Collar, and Root Rot</h3>

One of the most serious diseases that infects apples is Phytophthora crown, collar, or root rot. This disease is caused by several species of <i>Phytophthora</i>. Crown rot is a disease of the rootstock, affecting bark at the crown (the point where the roots join the stem). When the scion portion of the trunk is affected, the disease is called collar rot. Root rot occurs when the fungus attacks roots away from the crown area. These diseases may occur simultaneously, in any combination, or singly depending on the portion of the tree that is attacked.<P>

General foliar symptoms result from infection by <i>Phytophthora</i> spp. Infected trees exhibit varying degrees of decline:<P>
<ul>
<li>Trees will have poor terminal growth.
<li>Trees become stunted in comparison to non-infected trees.
<li>The foliage will generally be sparse and yellow.
<li>Early fall color may occur on infected trees. 
<li>The fruit will be small and color prematurely.
</ul>
Trees infected with <i>Phytophthora</i> typically decline slowly over many years; however, if infected during an excessively wet spring or fall, the tree may die in the first year.<P>

To see symptoms produced at the collar or crown, the bark must be removed. The underlying tissue is discolored orange-red to brown. Older infections are dark brown to almost black. A distinct margin separates healthy and diseased tissue. Initial infection sites on roots are difficult to see; however, as the disease progresses, the roots decay and become discolored, firm, and brittle. When secondary organisms invade decaying roots, they may become soft.<P>

The speed with which infected trees decline is dependent on several factors, such as the particular <i>Phytophthora</i> species, the tree's age, the type of rootstock and scion, water management, and climatic conditions. In general, younger trees, trees under stress, and trees attacked at the crown are more likely to collapse and die more quickly than older, stronger trees.<P>

<i>Phytophthora</i> spp. are soil-borne fungi that are favored by heavy, wet, poorly drained soils. In the absence of a host plant, the fungus persists in soil for long periods. Severe disease problems occur with heavy rains in late fall through spring, when the soil remains flooded or saturated for a long time. The fungus is most active during relatively cool temperatures. Because disease development is dependent on cool temperatures and high soil moisture, the activity of the fungus is limited during unfavorable conditions. Trees suffering from root rot alone may be able to regenerate roots and recover from infection when the environment is unfavorable for the fungus. In contrast, trees infected with crown or collar rot will not recover once infected, and the tree will eventually die.<P>

Water management is the key to controlling diseases caused by <i>Phytophthora</i> spp. Do not allow water to accumulate around trees crowns! Provide adequate drainage, and avoid planting in heavy soils, low spots, and areas that flood frequently. Once <i>Phytophthora</i> is established in an orchard, it is impossible to eradicate. Therefore, replanting where trees have died from this disease is risky. If trees are replanted in diseased areas, plant them on raised mounds or on broad ridges so that the upper roots are near the soil surface. Always plant with the graft union well above the soil line.<P>

Another important aspect of control is the use of disease-resistant rootstock and scion. This is particularly important in choosing cultivars to replant orchards where <i>Phytophthora</i> has been a problem. Rootstock and scion cultivars will vary in their sensitivity to different <i>Phytophthora</i> spp., therefore every effort should be made to identify the species present in the orchard before replanting.<P>

<h3>Fire Blight</h3>

Fire blight is a bacterial disease caused by <i>Erwinia amylovora</i>, a bacterium that causes a distinct fire-like appearance on infected plant parts. New shoots are highly susceptible to infection; however, all above-ground plant parts are susceptible to disease.<P>

The bacterium overwinters in cankers and invisible infections on twigs and in buds. In the spring, the bacteria multiplies in infected tissue and begins to ooze from natural openings in the plant. The bacterial cells spread to healthy tissue by water, insects, and pruning tools. Rain, sprinkle irrigation, or high humidity and temperatures between 75 and 85 degrees  F provide ideal conditions for infection and disease development. Symptoms develop in spring and summer; hot, dry summer weather generally stops spread and development of the disease.<P>

Apple cultivars vary in their susceptibility to fire blight. Highly susceptible cultivars such as 'Jonathan', 'Gala', 'Fuji', 'Mutsu' (Crispin), and 'Granny Smith' should be avoided in areas known to have a history of the disease.<P>

Cultural practices are important in managing this disease. Removing and destroying infected tissue from trees can go a long way in reducing the severity of the disease. When pruning, cut the branches several inches below visible symptoms, as the bacterium advance through the tissue ahead of symptom development. Clean pruning tools between pruning cuts to avoid inadvertent spread of the bacterium throughout the tree or orchard. Clean tools by dipping them in 70-95% alcohol solution or a 10-50% bleach solution between each pruning cut.<P>

Rapidly growing, young, succulent twigs resulting from excessive tree vigor are particularly susceptible to fire blight. Avoid practices that promote excessive vigor, such as excessive nitrogen fertilization, to reduce the incidence of disease. Proper orchard management practices, including irrigation, fertilization, pruning, thinning, and pest control, will help to maintain moderately vigorous, strong trees that will be less susceptible to bacterium attack.<P>

Antibiotics and copper compounds can be used to control fire blight in orchards with a history of disease. Timing of sprays is critical. Make applications from first bloom to petal fall, but beware of overuse, as copper can damage fruit and bacteria readily develop resistance to antibiotics.<P>

<h3>Crown Gall</h3>

Crown gall, caused by the soil-borne bacterium <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</I>, is an important disease of many plant species and is found in all types of soils worldwide. The bacterium is somewhat unique in its behavior. It stimulates plant tissue to grow and divide abnormally, causing tumor-like galls at infection sites. Gall development impedes the flow of water and nutrients in the plant, resulting in above-ground symptoms of decline and reduced growth.<P>

The bacterium enters the roots, crowns, and branches through wounds created by cultivation, pruning, insects, frost injury, and growth cracks. Once inside the tree, a tumor-inducing plasmid in the bacterium stimulates plant cells to grow abnormally. The resulting tumors, made of plant tissue, are rough in texture and appearance. This disease is sometimes confused with galls produced by woolly apple aphid. However, the woolly apple aphid generally produces more numerous, smaller galls. Additionally, the red-purple insects hidden in a white cottony wax will appear on the trunk of infected trees from spring through fall.<P>

Once a tree is diseased by crown gall, it will eventually die, though the progress of disease development may be slow, causing the tree to linger in a weak state. Decline of infected trees may be slowed by painting above-ground galls with paint containing antibiotics. When treating trees in this manner, it is important not to paint more than 50% of the tree circumference at one time. When trees die, remove and burn the stumps and roots. Wait 2-3 years before replanting.<P>

The best control for crown gall is preventing infection. Plant certified disease-free rootstock, and when planting, take care to avoid injuring the roots and crown. When cultivating around trees be careful to avoid injuring the crown and surface roots. In some cases, the crown and roots may be protected by dipping them in a biological control agent, <i>Agrobacterium radiobacter</i>, prior to planting. A. <i>radiobacter</i> is the same bacterium as A. t<i>umefaciens</i>, but it lacks the tumor-inducing plasmid, thus it is unable to cause disease. A. <i>radiobacter</i> protects the roots and crown by occupying infection sites and thereby excluding the disease-causing bacterium. Unfortunately, A. <i>radiobacter</i> is not effective against all strains of crown gall. Thus, this control practice is not 100% effective.<P>

<h3>Alternaria Rot</h3>

<i>Alternaria alternata</i> is a common saprophyte ( an organism capable of growth and survival without the aid of another living organism) which can become somewhat infectious to apple fruit that is predisposed to infection because of an injury. Common injuries that can lead to Alternaria rot include mechanical or chemical injury, sunscald, or chilling injury. Infection can occur before or after harvest, although it is more commonly a post-harvest problem.<P>

Alternaria rot is managed by avoiding injury during harvest and packing. Additionally, post-harvest fruit dips in chlorine can help to prevent post-harvest disease problems. Cold storage is another good practice that will reduce disease problems.<P>

<h3>Moldy Core</h3>

Moldy core is caused by many different species of fungi. This disease is characterized by infection within the locules (the cavity of the ovary or seed cavity), without penetration into the fruit flesh. External symptoms on the fruit are quite subtle, and typically the disease goes unnoticed until the fruit is cut open. External symptoms may include premature ripening, and infected fruit may drop from the tree.<P>

The fungi responsible for this disease colonize the flower parts as soon as the blossoms open. The fungi then enter the developing fruit through an opening in the calyx. Moldy core is primarily a problem during years with light fruit set or in years when dry weather in early summer is followed by heavy rains in late summer. In addition, wet weather during bloom may cause conditions favorable for the fungi to produce spores.<P>

Apple cultivars vary in their susceptibility to moldy core. This difference is primarily related to the presence of the sinus opening at the calyx end of the fruit. 'Delicious', 'Gravenstein', and 'Idared' are susceptible cultivars and should be avoided in areas prone to moldy core problems. In some studies, fungicides used during bloom have been successful in controlling moldy core, but the results are erratic and fungicides are rarely recommended. Cultural practices, such as tree training and pruning (which open up the tree canopy and allow good airflow and light penetration), will help to promote fast drying of plant surfaces, reducing the potential for spore development. These practices should help to reduce the incidence of moldy core.<P>

<h3>Nutrient Deficiencies</h3>

Nutrient deficiencies result either from a lack of available nutrients (low fertility) or from soil pH that inhibits the uptake of nutrients from the soil. Additionally, an imbalance of nutrients may impair a tree's ability to absorb certain nutrients. Symptoms of nutrient deficiencies vary depending on the deficient element. However, general symptoms include abnormal or reduced growth, discoloration of the foliage and fruit, loss of flowers, reduced yields, and poor fruit quality.<P>

In New Mexico the nutrients most commonly deficient are iron, manganese, and zinc. These elements are relatively unavailable in soils that have a high pH, which is typical of our high-alkaline, low-organic-matter soils.<P>

Iron deficiency, also called iron chlorosis, is identifiable by interveinal chlorosis, where the veins of the leaves remain green while the interveinal areas turn yellow. Severe deficiency may cause white spots or leaf scorch on affected foliage. The symptoms first appear on new growth, but the whole tree may be affected in severe situations. Leaf size is not affected by lack of iron, as happens with zinc deficiency. When iron chlorosis is the result of alkaline soil conditions, as in New Mexican orchards, it is best corrected by acidifying the soil with soil sulfur. As soil pH decreases, the iron in the soil will become available for plant use.<P>

Manganese deficiency symptoms may be similar to those of iron deficiency. The intervienal areas of the leaves become yellow or golden (but will not turn white). As with iron deficiency, a lack of manganese will not affect leaf size. Using acid-forming nitrogen fertilizers usually helps to reduce problems associated with manganese deficiency. Additionally, a foliar spray of manganese sulfate in April can help to alleviate the problem.<P>

Zinc deficiency symptoms develop on the tips of new growth. Leaves are small, stiff, and more narrow than normal--a symptom often called "little leaf." Other symptoms include yellow mottling of the foliage, reduced fruit size and quality, and slow development of lateral branches. In orchards with a history of zinc deficiency, yearly applications of zinc are necessary to control the situation. Zinc is best applied in the spring as the trees are leafing out. Foliar applications are usually more efficient than soil treatments.<P>

<h3>Bitter Pit</h3>

Bitter pit is a common disorder in apples grown in New Mexico. This physiological disorder is associated with an insufficient amount of calcium in the developing fruit. Bitter pit is not an infectious disease and does not spread from fruit to fruit.<P>

The disorder first appears as small, water-soaked lesions on the surface of the fruit. Gradually, the spots will turn brown and look like bruises. Spots vary in size from 2 to 10 mm, depending on the variety. With time, the spot will become sunken and the underlying tissue spongy. Spots most frequently occur at the calyx end of the fruit, though the entire fruit is susceptible. Fruit is predisposed to bitter pit while on the tree, but while symptoms can develop before harvest, the disorder often does not appear until after harvest. Maximum symptom development usually occurs within 1-2 months in storage. Affected fruit tastes bitter.<P>

Any condition that causes calcium to concentrate in the leaves at the expense of the fruit can cause bitter pit. The disorder is more likely to occur on vigorous upright branches with lots of leafy growth because calcium is diverted away from developing fruit to the rapidly growing leaves. Other factors contributing to bitter pit include variety susceptibility, poor fruit set, excessive nitrogen or potassium fertilization, and a hot, dry growing season. In New Mexico, climate plays an important role in the development of bitter pit. The hot, dry climate typical in many locations causes high rates of evapotranspiration (movement of water through the plant). High evapotranspiration rates cause a diversion of calcium to the leaves at the expense of the fruit. Once calcium gets into the leaves, it is not easily redistributed to the fruit. Additionally, trees that have lost their crop the previous year to frost are more likely to develop bitter pit the following year.<P>

Cultivars vary in their susceptibility to bitter pit. Selection of cultivars may be an important consideration in areas likely to have serious problems associated with the disorder. Apple varieties that are highly susceptible to bitter pit include 'Golden Delicious', 'Jonathan', and 'Granny Smith'. 'Red Delicious' is moderately susceptible. 'McIntosh' and 'Rome Beauty' are fairly resistant to bitter pit.<P>

There is no control for bitter pit once fruit develop symptoms. The best management for this disorder is to use cultural practices that reduce excessive vegetative growth and increase the fruit-to-foliage ratio. Take soil and leaf tissue samples for analysis of nutrient levels and develop a fertilization program according to the orchard's needs. Avoid excessive applications of nitrogen and potassium fertilizer. Avoid heavy dormant pruning, as it results in excessive growth and light fruit set. Summer pruning of vigorous young trees may help lower the incidence of bitter pit. In hot, dry climates, growers should evaluate the potential damage from bitter pit and sunscald and prune accordingly. For example, if sunscald will cause greater losses than bitter pit, prune the trees to encourage moderately vigorous growth.<P>

Other recommended management practices for avoiding heavy losses include avoiding early thinning and overthinning; avoiding early harvest; and storing apples in a cool, climate-controlled environment. In some areas, summer calcium sprays using calcium nitrate or calcium chloride may be effective in managing bitter pit. Apply at least three sprays at one-month intervals beginning mid-June. Take care when applying these materials, as they may cause fruit russeting or leaf burn. Additionally, post-harvest dips in calcium chloride may reduce the amount of bitter pit that develops after harvest.<P>

<h3>Watercore</h3>

Watercore is similar to bitter pit in that it is an abiotic disorder that does not spread between fruit. This disorder, which causes water-soaked, translucent, glassy cores, is caused by rapid translocation of sugar into the fruit. The disorder is not usually noticeable from the outside of the fruit.<P>

Watercore is most likely to develop on fruit exposed to high levels of heat and sunlight. Additionally, the conditions that favor bitter pit, such as excessive vigor and poor fruit set, also increase the incidence of watercore. Cultural practices that reduce the incidence and severity of bitter pit are also recommended for managing watercore.<P>

The high sugar content of the fruit makes mildly affected fruit good eating quality. Mild watercore symptoms usually disappear after a few weeks in storage. Thus, timely storage of affected fruit can help avoid losses associated with the disorder. Affected fruit should not be stored over six months, as the fruit may begin to develop internal browning.<P>

<h3>Salt Injury</h3>

Too much soluble salt, such as sodium and chlorine, in the soil or water can adversely affect apple trees by causing burning or scorching on the leaf tips or margins (edges). Water deeply so that accumulated salts leach down to the root zone.<P>

<h3>Frost Injury</h3>

At maximum dormancy, apple trees can tolerate temperatures well below freezing. However, in early spring as temperatures increase, the plant begins to grow and the young succulent growth is susceptible to frost injury. Mild frost during early development may injure fruit (causing corky ring), twigs, and branches (causing dieback and cankers). Frost later in fruit development can cause internal necrosis. Hard freezes can cause canker damage to larger branches and the trunk. Sap may ooze from cracks caused by low temperatures, a condition called "gummosis."<P>

In areas were freezing temperatures are a serious threat, the likelihood of frost injury may be reduced by conserving heat in the orchard. Keep cover crops or weeds mowed or tilled under. This will help keep the soil surface firm and moist. Experience shows that recently disked orchards or orchards with knee-high ground cover can be considerably colder than an orchard with clean-cultivated, firm, moist floor. In some locations n New Mexico, it may be more important to try to prolong dormancy, thus avoiding injury due to  premature bud break. In these areas, ground cover may help by keeping the temperatures a little cooler. Sprinklers or wind machines also may be beneficial in areas with high frost damage.<P>

<h3>Sunburn Injury</h3>
Sunburn, also referred to as sunscald, affects fruit that are exposed to direct sunlight. the first symptoms of sunburn is the development of yellow or flushed areas on the skin. The discolored areas eventually turn dark while the fruit is still on the tree. This symptom is easy to see, so damage fruit can be avoided at harvest. Another symptom, small yellow spots, are less easy to see and may be overlooked at harvest. The injury is noticed in storage when the spots turn brown. <P>

Sunburn is managed by proper tree training an pruning. In some areas, overhead sprinklers may help to reduce the heat load on developing fruit. However, overhead irrigation can cause other disease problems, so its value in preventing sunburn is probably limited.<P>

<h1>Commercial Everbearing Red Raspberry Production for New Mexico</h1>
<h2>Guide H-318</h2>
<h3>George W. Dickerson, Extension Horitculture Specilalist</h3>

The raspberry belongs to a group of small-fruit crops called brambles. Brambles have perennial root systems and biennial canes. Canes produced during spring and summer (primocanes) will produce fruit on the same canes the following summer (floricanes). The canes will then die back to ground level during winter. The canes of most cultivated brambles are prickly. Thornless blackberries and thornless boysenberries are two exceptions. <p>
The raspberry is an aggregate fruit composed of 75 to 125 drupelets. The drupelets are held together by microscopic, interlacing hairs. The raspberry fruit is different than the blackberry in that the core of the raspberry fruit remains on the plant when it's picked. The blackberry core becomes part of the edible fruit when it's harvested. Raspberry fruit can be red, yellow, purple or black. <p>
<h4>CLIMATIC ADAPTATION </h4>
The red raspberry is the hardiest or most cold tolerant of the bramble or cane berries. 'Latham' has been known to survive temperatures of -40 degrees F. Black raspberries, or blackcaps, are adapted to more moderate winter climates. Both can be grown in northern New Mexico, but must be protected from late spring freezes after plants break winter dormancy. <p>
Most traditional or standard raspberries (biennial canes) have a chill unit requirement of about 800+ hours below 33 degrees  F. This chill unit requirement is normally met sometime in January or February in northern New Mexico. Canes subjected to temperatures above 40 degrees F after the chill unit requirement is met rapidly break dormancy. As a result, buds rapidly lose their cold hardiness. <p>
Canes that have broken dormancy are susceptible to freeze damage. The amount of freeze damage depends on several factors, including the duration and intensity of the cold period and the levels of carbohydrates or food in the canes. Temperatures that fluctuate above and below freezing can cause the greatest amount of damage. The damage is intensified during dry, windy weather. <p>
New foliage on freeze damaged canes in the early spring may appear to be normal. However, as temperatures warm up in June, increased water loss from leaves causes new foliage to be stunted and berries to shrivel. Hot, dry, windy weather will result in soft, seedy berries. Berries will often turn white and leaves will often be scorched. <p>
Gardeners can often overcome these problems by using microclimates in the garden. Walls or trees can protect raspberries from spring winds. Raspberries planted on the north side of a house will break dormancy later in the spring, and berries will mature under cooler conditions. Commercial growers, however, can rarely take advantage of such microclimates. <p>
<h4>EVERBEARING RED RASPBERRIES </h4>
The New York Agricultural Experiment Station released an everbearing raspberry called 'Heritage' in 1969. Everbearing raspberries differ from standard raspberries in that they send up new canes during spring and summer, and produce berries on the terminal ends of these canes during fall of the same year. After frost, canes can be mowed down to 4-6 inches with a brush hog or sickle mower during winter. New canes are produced the following spring, and this eliminates the problem of freeze damage on overwintering canes that occurs with standard raspberries. This also solves the problem of selectively thinning canes that have fruited from those that haven't. Mowing also reduces insect and disease problems the following year. Labor needed to prune standard raspberries is also eliminated. <p>
Everbearing raspberries also produce fruit of superior quality when grown as a fall crop. Cool weather seems to increase sweetness of the berries and red color. Fruit scalding is eliminated and field heat is reduced, resulting in firmer berries with longer shelf life. <p>
Everbearing raspberries left unmowed during winter will act like standard raspberries the following summer. Canes that produced berries during the previous fall (terminal ends) will produce berries again on the lower portions of the canes the following summer. This, however, defeats the purpose of growing everbearing raspberries. Freeze damaged canes would still be a problem. The fall crop also generally produces higher yields. Yields in New Mexico will vary from 4,500-7,000 pounds per acre, or 8,000-12,000 half pints of berries per acre. <p>
 New canes are produced each year from basal cane buds. Suckers are also produced from an extensive, spreading root system. Flower bud induction on these primocanes takes place during summer (under long days) and is correlated with age of the terminal meristems. Flower bud initiation generally takes place when the canes have reached 35-45 nodes in height. Thus, the sooner vegetative growth starts in spring, the sooner flowering will take place. Early vegetative growth can, however, be injured by late spring frosts. <p>
<h4>SITE SELECTION </h4>
Everbearing red raspberries grow best during relatively cool, dry summers. Dry weather reduces the incidence of cane and foliar diseases. Hot, dry, windy weather will, however, retard cane growth. The harvest period during fall should be relatively free of rainfall. Rainy weather increases fungal infection of the berries. <p>
The raspberry site should have good air drainage, preferably on a hillside. This prevents an accumulation of cold air. Sloping sites will also provide good surface water drainage during periods of excessive rainfall. South-facing slopes warm earlier in spring, resulting in earlier cane growth. <p>
Raspberries grow best in New Mexico in loam or sandy loam soils with a pH of 6.5-7.5. Such soils should be 2-4 feet deep, well-drained and relatively free of salt. Raspberries have little tolerance for soils high in either calcium or sodium salts. Soils should also be free of perennial noxious weeds and nematodes. Perennial weeds and nematodes should be eliminated the year before raspberries are established. <p>
Soil improvement programs should be started the year before raspberries are established. Green manure crops of winter wheat, barley or rye should be planted in fall and turned under the following spring. Barnyard manures can be applied at a rate of 8-12 tons per acre during fall. Poultry manure can be applied at the rate of 5-6 tons per acre. All manures should be free of weed seeds and low in salts. <p>
<h4>PLANT ESTABLISHMENT </h4>
Most new plantings are established from dormant, bareroot plants. Certified, virus-free planting stock is recommended. This minimizes the chance of introducing new disease and insect pests into your field. <p>
Establishing everbearing red raspberries is generally more difficult than establishing standard types. Wind and salt in either the soil, water or both severely reduces the survival of everbearing raspberries. The use of high-quality irrigation water, and windbreaks on the west and south sides of the planting, greatly increases plant survival. <p>
If possible, plants should be shipped in by plane or truck directly from the nursery. They should be unpacked immediately and the roots soaked in water before being planted. Dipping the roots in a liquid gel treatment that attracts water, and a root stimulator solution, just before planting also improves survival. Plants arriving during bad weather can be stored in moist burlap at 32-38 degrees  F in the dark, until the weather improves, or by heeling them in until you're ready to plant. Plants to be heeled in should be laid out in a single layer of plants in a shaded, shallow trench deep enough to accommodate the roots. Roots should then be covered with soil, firmed for good soil contact, and watered. Plants can generally be held quite safely under these conditions for 1-2 weeks. <p>
Dormant plants should be planted in early spring. Root development occurs faster at cooler soil temperatures (50 degrees  F). Planting sprouted plants later in the season generally results in a poor stand. <p>
The soil should be thoroughly prepared before planting begins. Rows should be 8-10 feet apart. The distance between rows depends on cultivation equipment. Growers should take into account that the eventual hedgerow of raspberries will be 2-3 feet wide. Enough room should be left at the end of the rows to turn tractors around. Space should also be left for access roads. <p>
Plants should be spaced 18-24 inches apart within the row. Holes are normally dug with a shovel or post-hole digger. Plants can also be placed in a plowed furrow and covered. Plants should be planted 1-3 inches deeper than they were dug from the nursery. Roots should be spread out in the hole, then covered with soil. Firming the soil up around the cane removes any excess air pockets. Tops are generally cut off 4-6 inches above ground level. All plants should be watered immediately. <p>
Plants that do not survive the first year can be replaced with new bareroot plants the following spring. Holes in the hedgerow can also be filled in by digging rooted suckers for transplants from the alleys between rows. This can be done during the early fall or early spring. In both cases, a soil ball should accompany the roots to minimize shock to the sucker. Sucker tops should be cut back to balance the root and cane growth. <p>
Raspberries can also be established from tissue cultured plants. Tissue cultured plants are generally actively growing green plants, 3-6 inches high, and growing in individual plugs or cells. Tissue cultured plants are vegetatively propagated in labs and/or greenhouses from cells of virus-indexed mother plants (certified to be free of viruses).  <p>
Tissue cultured plants shipped to growers have well developed roots and are hardened off outside before shipment. Plants should not be transplanted to the field until after all danger of frost has passed. They may be planted throughout the summer (except in very hot areas) up until one month before frost. <p>
Transplanting should occur late in the day, early in the evening or during cloudy weather to reduce transplant shock. Transplant into moist soil planting plugs one inch below ground level firming soil up around the plant. Be sure to keep the soil moist but not soaked. <p>
Although the cost of using tissue cultured plants is much higher than bareroot stock, tissue cultured plants generally exhibit greater vigor, are more uniform in size, and have greater growth rates and field survival. Most tissue cultured plants are also adapted for mechanical transplanting. <p>
<h4>FERTILIZATION </h4>
During the latter phases of land preparation, preplant phosphorous fertilizer should be broadcast and rototilled or banded into the centers of potential hedgerows at a rate of 50 -80 pounds of P2O5 per acre. Potassium should be applied only if a soil analysis indicates there is a potassium deficiency. <p>
As new plants start to develop the first year, nitrogen fertilizers should be applied at a rate of 10-20 pounds of elemental nitrogen per acre. Nitrogen fertilizers should only be applied after the plants have had sufficient time to establish themselves (4-6 weeks). Earlier or heavier applications of nitrogen may burn young developing roots. Nitrogen should be applied at a rate of 40-100 pounds per acre in following years. All nitrogen should be applied in split applications--half in late March or early April and half in late June. Phosphorous should be applied in spring at a rate of 40 to 80 pounds of P2O5 per acre.  <p>
Growers using furrow or sprinkler irrigation should band all fertilizers 2-4 inches away from the outside edges of the hedgerow, and 2-4 inches deep. Soluble formulations of nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizers can also be applied through surface or underground drip systems. Nitrogen fertilizers can also be broadcast across the hedgerow and watered in. <p>
Plants that show symptoms of iron or zinc chlorosis should be treated with foliar applications of iron or zinc sulfates. Plants can also be treated with foliar or soil applications of iron or zinc chelates. Foliar applications of these materials should not be applied during flowering because flowers may be burned. Growers should follow the label rates for best results. <p>
<h4>IRRIGATION TECHNIQUES </h4>
Raspberries can be irrigated with furrow, sprinkler or drip systems. Furrow irrigation is generally the cheapest way to irrigate but is not appropriate for fields that are not level. <p>
Sprinklers can be used on land that is not level. Sprinklers can also be used for protection from freeze damage during fall. Sprinklers, however, can be quite expensive. Growers may also find that foliar and fruit diseases increase. Both furrow and sprinkler irrigation increase weed populations within the alleys, in contrast to trickle irrigation.  <p>
Although drip irrigation is somewhat expensive, it's the most efficient way of applying water in terms of water use. Because water is generally confined to the root area, weeds are not as prolific in the alleys. Drip irrigation systems apply water more uniformly and require less labor, but can be damaged by rodents and cultivation. <p>
Raspberries should never be severely stressed for moisture. Plants should be irrigated anytime the available moisture in the top 2-3 feet of soil drops below 50% available moisture. Irrigation is particularly critical during bloom and when the berries are sizing. <p>
<h4>TRAINING AND PEST CONTROL </h4>
Unlike 'Latham' and other standard raspberries, 'Heritage' and other everbearing raspberries do not have to be trained to a trellis. The primocanes are erect, sturdy and rarely require support. 'Heritage' suckers prolifically and will form a mature hedge in about 3 years. Hedges should be contained by cultivation, discing or rototilling. Hedges are generally maintained at 2-3 feet wide. Wider hedges yield smaller berries and are harder to pick.  <p>
Cultivation will control most weeds within the alleys. Because raspberries have relatively shallow roots, cultivate no deeper than 2 inches. Annual weeds within the hedgerow can be controlled with preemergent herbicides. Information on registered herbicides for use on raspberries can be obtained from your county Extension agent. Perennial weeds should be eliminated before the planting is established. <p>
Few insect pests have been noted on raspberries in New Mexico. Growers should, however, keep a watchful eye on their plants. New insect infestations should be reported to the local county Extension agent, who can help with insect control. <p>
Raspberries are susceptible to numerous virus diseases. Once infected, plants can't be cured. Viruses are commonly spread by aphids, nematodes or infected pollen. <p>
The most effective way to control viruses is to plant virus-free planting stock. Wild raspberries in the area should also be destroyed. Diseased plants in the field should be removed and destroyed. Aphids should also be controlled. <p>
Verticillium wilt is a soil-borne fungus that can be a problem in some areas of New Mexico. Leaves on infected plants turn yellow and eventually die. Canes often turn blue as the disease proceeds up the canes. Vascular tissues generally exhibit red discolorations.  <p>
Certified, disease-free plants planted in a verticillium wilt-free soil is the best method of control. Raspberries should not be planted in soils that have been planted to potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, strawberries, or other cane berries that have been infected with wilt in previous years. Infected plants should be  removed from the field and burned. <p>
All fields should be tested for nematode problems before planting. Typically, nematodes are a greater problem on sandy soils than on heavier soils. The root lesion and dagger nematodes will cause weak cane growth, small leaves and will reduce fruit size. The foliage may also turn yellow and drop in hot weather. Soil fumigation the summer before is the most effective means of control. <p>
<h4>POLLINATION </h4>
The raspberry is self-fruitful. Pollen transfer generally takes place within the same flowers by wind and insects. Honeybees are responsible for 90-95% of pollination. There should be at least two hives per acre. On cold, windy days, pollination is normally done by bumble bees and wild bees. <p>
Lack of bee activity may result in a condition known as crumbly berry. Normally, raspberry flowers have 100-125 pistils. Typically, 75-85 drupelets will develop. When pollination is incomplete and fewer drupelets develop, the berry will often crumble when it's picked. Crumbly berry can also be caused by drought, low soil fertility, viruses, winter damage, variations in male and female sterility, deep cultivation and nematode infestations. <p>
<h4>HARVESTING </h4>
All pickers should be trained before harvesting begins. Mature fruit should be gently removed from the plant with the thumb and two fingers, and a slight twisting of the wrist rather that a pull-and-jerk technique. Berries should not be squeezed, and only a few should be held in the palms at one time before being transferred to the picking containers. Small picking containers can be fastened to the waist or hung around the neck. Care should be used in transferring berries from the picking containers to bulk trays. All moldy or insect-damaged berries should be discarded in the field.  <p>
At no time should berries or bulk trays be allowed to come in contact with the soil. All containers should be kept as clean as possible.  <p>
Picking should always be done in the morning to reduce the amount of field heat in the berries. The berries are also firmer and easier to pick at this time. Bulk trays should be shaded at all times. Trays should be transferred to walk-in coolers as soon as possible. <p>
Fruit should be graded as soon as possible. Only firm, blemish-free, mature fruit should be selected. Fruit are generally packed two to three berries deep in shallow, half-pint baskets and covered with perforated cellophane. Berries should be transported to market as soon as possible. Graded berries can, if necessary, be held at 31-32 degrees  F and 90-95% humidity for 1-2 days.  <p>
<h4>EVERBEARING VARIETIES </h4>
<b>'Heritage'</b>--canes very vigorous, hardy, erect, sturdy and sucker prolifically; medium-sized berry with conic shape, firm flesh, good flavor and excellent quality; rated number one everbearing red raspberry in nation. <p>
<b>'Redwing'</b>--canes vigorous, moderately dense, green with light red overlay; berries slightly larger than 'Heritage' at beginning of season but somewhat softer; more heat resistant than 'Heritage' and earlier. <p>
<b>'Autumn Bliss'</b>--canes moderately numerous, fairly erect, green with pink tinge; berries larger, slightly firm and better tasting than 'Heritage' and earlier ripening.  <p>
Other varieties of everbearing raspberries that might be considered include 'Amity' and 'Summit'. Both tend to ripen earlier than 'Heritage'. Fruit of 'Amity' tend to adhere to the receptacle (core of fruit attached to plant) more tightly making them somewhat more difficult to pick.<p>

<h1>Fertilization Programs for Apple Orchards</h1>
<h2>Guide H-319</h2>
<h3>Esteban A. Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</h3>

Many factors, including climate, soil, irrigation, varieties, pruning, insects, and tree nutrition influence the growth and production of fruit trees. Some of these factors can be controlled by growers; others cannot. Tree nutrition is probably the most important factor for a successful orchard operation, and it can be controlled through a proper fertilization program.<p>
Sixteen mineral elements are essential for plant growth. Three (oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon) are obtained by the tree from water and air. The thirteen remaining elements are divided into two groups:<p>
<ol>
<li>Major essential elements: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sulfur (S).<p> 
<li>Minor (trace) elements: iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), boron (B), molybdenum (Mo), and chloride (Cl).<p>
</ol>
Major elements are needed in much larger quantities than minor ones; all are found in the soil. However, it is not enough for these elements to be present in the soil--they must also be in a form available to trees so that trees can take them up and use them. Among other factors, soil pH (acidity or alkalinity) and balance between elements will affect the availability of nutrient elements in the soil.<p>
Nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, iron, and zinc appear to be the nutrients mainly needed in New Mexico apple orchards.<p>
<h4>NITROGEN (N)</h4>
Nitrogen is the nutrient most used in fruit trees and is usually the first element to be considered in an orchard fertilization program, as shoot growth depends highly on nitrogen content. Nitrogen fertilizer rates for young trees are based on tree age and growth rate of shoots; fertilization of mature, heavy-bearing trees may be based in part on terminal growth. Nitrogen deficiencies can reduce fruiting and make fruit small and highly colored; leaves will be small and pale green, dropping early. Low or older leaves turn light green first; individual limbs may die and entire trees are stunted. <p>
Excess nitrogen delays fruit maturity and negatively affects red color on apples. It also delays flowering and can promote late-season vegetative growth, increasing chances of freeze injury, especially in young trees. Excessive tree vigor resulting from too much N can be partially compensated for by late summer pruning. This has two main effects: it improves fruit color by improving light distribution and tends to limit root growth.<p>
Recommendations for time of nitrogen application to apple orchards are often confusing and vary considerably among apple-growing regions in the country. However, a nitrogen fertilization program can be better understood if it is based on the root uptake period, nitrogen storage pattern in trees, and on time of the season or tree physiological stage.<p>
The entire tree root system is capable of nutrient absorption; however, the absorption rate is greatest in new root growth (root tips), which usually are white in color. The period of greatest nutrient uptake coincides with the period of maximum root growth. Depending on the year, this would be from about March through October in New Mexico, but this period always will be shorter in northern New Mexico than in the southern area. Nitrate uptake increases with shoot elongation and remains high until leaf fall; it then decreases sharply from leaf fall to the initiation of root growth.<p>
Annual nitrogen applications are necessary to maintain sufficient nitrogen reserves in the tree. About 80% of the annual nitrogen use is from tree reserves, while only 20% is from the immediate nitrogen application. The later nitrogen is applied during the growing season, the less it is used the year of application, and the greater its contribution the next year. Therefore, nitrogen applied late in the year is stored, mainly in the root system, for use the following year. Nitrogen used during bloom is drawn from nitrogen the tree has stored from the previous year's application. Shoot growth in late spring or early summer then becomes dependent on external nitrogen supply. In some cases, all stored nitrogen is exhausted by the end of June. In nitrogen-deficient orchards, nitrogen from fertilizers applied during the current season can be absorbed immediately.<p>
Based on these findings, half the recommended nitrogen should be applied during the post-harvest period, to be stored and used early in the following season. The other half should be applied after bloom. (Coarse textured (sandy) soils are an exception to this recommendation because nitrogen fertilizer applied in the fall is subject to leaching.) Foliar application of nitrogen during the season also helps trees. Fall season applications will be absorbed by roots while trees have foliage, and whenever temperatures are above 45°.<p>
Nitrogen rates should be adjusted so young, non-bearing trees grow 24-36 in. per year. The recommended rate is 1/20 lb of pure nitrogen per year of age of tree. To calculate the amount of a given nitrogen fertilizer needed, use the following equation:<p>

<pre>	Age of tree (years) x 5 	= lb fertilizer/tree
	________________________
	% of N fertilizer</pre>

<i>Example:</i> Fertilizing 30-year-old trees with ammonium sulfate (AS) which has 21% N --
<pre>		30 x 5 	   = 7.1 lb AS/tree
		______
		  21</pre>

Other formulas recommend 1/5 lb N (or 1 lb of ammonium sulfate) per inch of trunk diameter.<p>
Nitrogen fertilization rates for mature, heavy-bearing trees fluctuate from 150 to 200 lb of nitrogen per acre, or 750-1,000 lb of ammonium sulfate per acre. Annual shoot (terminal) growth should be around 6-10 in. per year. If growth patterns are higher or lower, nitrogen rates should be adjusted accordingly. A general recommendation for apple trees is listed in table 1.<p>
Ammonium sulfate is the nitrogen formulation most recommended for orchards in New Mexico because it acidifies the soil somewhat. Although temporary, this action can make available some minor elements for use by apple trees.<p>

<b>Table 1. Amount of N recommended for apple trees.</b>
_________________________________________________________________________________
<pre>	Age (years)		N per tree or per acre
_________________________________________________________________________________
	1			None*
	2			1/4 lb/tree if growth is poor
	3-5			1/4-1/3 lb/tree
	6-7			1/2 lb/tree
	over 7			150-200 lb/acre
__________________________________________________________________________________</pre>

* When leaves have appeared and young trees are growing vigorously, broadcast monthly applications of N at the rate of 0.05 lb N per tree (0.25 lb ammonium sulfate).<p>

Any formulation of nitrogen fertilizer is converted to ammonium, then to nitrate, before it is absorbed by the tree's root system. Nitrates are water soluble and can be easily leached out in irrigation water. Generally, tree utilization of surface broadcast nitrogen fertilizer is low; thus, good fertilization practices are needed to prevent nitrogen losses through leaching. The best way to apply nitrogen and other fertilizers is through drip irrigation, where nutrients are carried close to the root system and recommended rates can be evenly distributed throughout the season. Another good way to incorporate nitrogen into the soil is by injecting liquid fertilizers into the soil; several applications are needed during the year to take full advantage of this system. Surface broadcast application of nitrogen and other nutrients, with subsequent soil incorporation by discing, will always have some losses, first through volatilization, then through leaching. Splitting fertilization rates throughout the year may prevent most leaching losses, but may not be practical.<p>
<h4>POTASSIUM (K)</h4>
Potassium deficiency is not common in New Mexico or in the southwestern states, mainly because the clay contained in soils releases enough potassium for tree use. In many cases, apple trees' perennial root system permits absorption of enough nutrients from soil that would be deficient for annual or seed crops. Apple trees growing in sandy soils, however, usually require potassium applications. Leaf analysis will help determine if potassium fertilizer applications are needed. Potassium sulfate (44% K ) is preferred over potassium chloride (muriate of potash) to avoid chlorine toxicity that can occur in low-rainfall areas. Mild potassium deficiency is similar to nitrogen deficiency, causing yellowish-green leaves. A severe deficiency will cause foliage necrosis, especially with scorched leaf margins, similar to soil salt build-up symptoms. Apply 150-200 lb of potassium per acre every other year if a deficiency occurs. <p>
Although no specific research has been conducted, it is believed potassium and phosphorus fertilizers can be soil-incorporated before planting at a rate of about 200 lb per acre. These nutrients will be spread throughout the soil and be available for root uptake for several years. Higher amounts are needed when a cover crop or sod is present.
<h4>PHOSPHORUS (P)</h4>
Fruit trees, including apples, have not responded to phosphorus fertilization, regardless of soil or leaf analysis results; therefore, no phosphorus fertilization has been recommended in the past. Furthermore, the high pH in New Mexico soils makes soil-applied phosphorus fertilizer immobile, and it will not move down the soil profile more than 1 in. per year. As with potassium, the extensive and perennial root system of apple trees tends to absorb enough soil phosphorus to fulfill tree requirements. Whenever phosphorus deficiencies occur, they appear on the shoots, petioles, and leaves. The shoot growth appears slender, petioles of the leaves are somewhat upright, the leaves may be smaller than normal, and they tend to be dark green with reddish or purplish tinting of the midrib and larger veins.<p>
Sources of phosphorus fertilizer for apple orchard use have always been superphosphate or the formulation 18-46-0 (N-P-K). Unfortunately, phosphorus fertilizer will not travel down the soil profile in basic (calcareous) soils. However, research in Washington state with monoammonium phosphate (MAP) fertilizer has shown excellent responses in apple orchards, especially in low-vigor trees. This fertilizer is highly soluble and travels down to the root system, making it available for uptake by the trees. Applying 200 lb of MAP about every 2 years will improve apple trees' growth and production.<p>
<h4>IRON AND ZINC (Fe, Zn)</h4>
For the most part, iron and zinc are found in sufficient amounts for tree needs in New Mexico soils; however, calcareous soils (pH > 7.5) render iron and zinc nutrients unavailable for tree uptake. Bright or pale yellow foliage (iron chlorosis) with a network of green veins identifies iron deficiency. Zinc deficiency is characterized by small leaves and short internodes, making all the foliage in a shoot clump together, appearing like a rosette or lion's tail. In acute deficiencies some necrotic (dead) spots between leaf veins also can be seen. Symptoms of iron chlorosis usually appear with flushes of new growth; zinc deficiency appears in the middle of the season. In some instances, twigs die back after the first year.<p>
Foliar sprays are recommended to correct this problem. Chelated forms of iron and zinc have been successful. Although such sprays are expensive, they are less likely to cause leaf burning. Zinc and iron sulfate also work when combined with foliarly formulated urea (uran 42%). Sometimes it is necessary to include a water buffer in the solution, which neutralizes the water and helps the chemical be absorbed better by foliage. Usually two sprays are required to correct iron deficiency. Apply the first about 4 weeks after bloom and the second about 3 weeks later. <p>
Zinc may be applied in the fall as a post-harvest application, but the most effective time for application is in the spring before buds open. Higher rates can be used at this stage than later in the season. Spray at or before green tip. Fall applications may be needed where deficiencies are difficult to correct; both applications, post-harvest and spring, may even be needed.<p>
Chelated forms of zinc and iron must be used for soil applications. These formulations dissolve slowly in the soil and can be used by trees before being tied up by soil particles. In high-pH soils, iron and zinc sulfate are quickly transformed to unavailable forms and cannot be taken up by roots. Though chelated formulations of iron and zinc are more expensive than sulfates, they are more effective. Chelates usually help overcome zinc and iron deficiency problems for more than one season, but tree response is slower. Sequestrene 330 Fe has been the best chelated source for iron.<p>
<h4>GENERAL GUIDELINES</h4>
Annual soil tests are recommended for apple orchards to monitor salt build-up and nutrient (N, P, K) accumulation throughout the soil profile. Minor elements need not be tested. Topsoil (1 1/2 ft) and subsoil (1 1/2-3 ft) should be tested separately. Leaf (tissue) analysis is recommended once or twice a year, if possible, to indicate nutrient uptake by the trees. Several years of tissue analysis will show the trend followed after a given fertilization program. For accurate results, sample 60-100 leaves from the current year's shoot growth in July. Collect leaves from shoulder height at the tree's periphery, using leaves from the middle of the current season's shoot. Sample the same orchard area and the same variety every year. Select only healthy leaves with no spray, insect, or disease damage; sample problem trees separately.<p>
Incorporating manure into orchard soil can also add needed N, P, K. One ton of manure contains around 10 lb N, 5 lb P, and 10 lb K. Manure also increases the soil's organic matter content. Organic matter is a transitory part of the soil that is continually decomposing and must be replaced regularly. When organic matter is lacking, clay (heavy) soils become physically difficult to manage, as water intake and aeration is reduced because of soil compaction. Sandy soils without organic matter lack body and the capacity to hold water and nutrients.<p>
Cover (green) crops can also be used to increase soil organic matter. Legumes (beans, clover) also incorporate some nitrogen into the soil. When a non-legume cover crop is plowed under as a green manure crop, it is recommended that 30 lb N be applied for each ton of material to speed up decomposition.<p>

<h1>Raspberries for the Home Garden</h1>
<h2>Guide H-320</h2>
<h3>George W. Dickerson, Extension Horticulture Specialist</h3>

Raspberries are one of the most delicate and delicious small fruits grown in New Mexico. Although red raspberries prefer cooler areas, everbearing varieties have successfully produced fall crops in warmer areas. Black raspberries (blackcaps) prefer moderate winters and may need to be protected in colder areas of the state.<p>
<h3>TYPES OF RASPBERRIES</h3>
The raspberry is an aggregate fruit composed of 75 to 125 drupelets. The fruit differ from the blackberry in that the core of the raspberry fruit remains on the plant when picked while the blackberry core becomes part of the edible fruit when harvested.<p>
Raspberries may be classified by color and/or fruiting habit. Raspberries may be red, black, purple, or yellow in color. Red raspberries tend to be more cold hardy than black raspberries; have larger berries and more erect canes; and sucker prolifically. Black raspberries are less cold hardy; have smaller, seedier and more aromatic berries and arching canes; and tend to form clumps of canes. Purple raspberries are hybrids of red and black raspberries and tend to respond in growth habit similar to a black raspberry, although canes may be more vigorous with larger berries. Most yellow raspberries are similar to red raspberries in growth habit.<p>
Red raspberries may also be classified as "standard" (traditional, summer-bearing) or "everbearing" (fall-bearing) in fruiting habit. Standard varieties produce biennial canes on perennial root systems. Canes produced by standard raspberries in the first growing season will produce fruit during the following summer. The canes will then die back to ground level during the winter. Dead canes must be removed selectively to leave more space for one year old canes that will produce fruit the next summer. Standard raspberry canes must also be trained to a trellis or supported in some manner.<p>
Fruiting canes of standard raspberry varieties tend to break dormancy early in the spring and may be damaged by late spring freezes. Fruit produced on such canes in the summer will often shrivel and die. Standard varieties may need to be protected with straw in the early spring or planted on the north side of a house to keep plants dormant longer in the spring. Partial shade during the summer in hotter areas of the state will help reduce sunburn on the berries and increase sweetness.<p>
Everbearing red raspberries differ from standard red raspberries in that they send up new canes during the spring and summer and produce berries during the fall of the same year. After frost, all canes can be pruned back 1-2" from ground level. New canes will emerge the following spring, eliminating the problem of freeze damage on overwintering canes that occurs with standard raspberry varieties. Berries produced on everbearing varieties in the fall are free of sunburn and are sweeter and redder than berries produced in the summer on standard varieties. Canes of everbearing raspberry varieties do not have to be trained to a trellis like standard varieties.<p>
<h3>SOIL PREPARATION</h3>
Raspberries grow best in a loam or sandy loam soil with a pH of 6.5-7.5. Adding ample quantities of compost and peat moss will help buffer alkalinity, increase the water-holding capacity of the soil, and improve soil aeration. Turn the soil over to a depth of two or more feet for good drainage.<p>
<h3>PLANT ESTABLISHMENT</h3>
Raspberries are normally propagated from dormant, bareroot plants (suckers). Certified, virus-free planting stock is recommended to minimize the introduction of disease and insect pests.<p>
Plant dormant plants in the early spring before new growth begins. Upon receipt, soak plants in water with a root stimulator for 15 minutes to improve survival.<p>
Raspberries are normally planted in rows and trained to form a hedge. Dig planting holes with a shovel, spreading raspberry roots evenly throughout the hole. Cover the roots with soil: be sure to firm the soil around plants for good contact between soil and roots. Water plants immediately after planting. Row width, plant spacing (in row), depth of planting, and clipping height (height of canes left in garden after planting) usually depend on the type of raspberry planted (table 1).<p>

<b>Table 1.  Row width, planting spacing, depth of planting and clipping height for new raspberry plants.</b>
________________________________________________________________________________
<pre>Raspberry	Row	   Plant	Planting	Clipping
Type		Width	  Spacing	Depth		Height
_________________________________________________________________________________
		 ft	    "		  "		  "
red		6-8	   2-2 1/2	 1-2		 2-4
black		8-10	   3-4		 0		 0
_________________________________________________________________________________</pre>
*Depth planted below soil surface as compared to its original depth when grown in the nursery. A change in coloration on cane will indicate soil line from nursery.<p>

Plants that do not survive the first year can be replaced with new bareroot plants the following spring. Holes in a red raspberry hedgerow can also be filled in using rooted suckers for transplants from areas between rows during the early fall or spring. In both cases, a soil ball should accompany the roots to minimize transplant shock to the sucker. If transplanted in the fall, suckers should be cut back to balance root and cane growth.<p>
Because black raspberries don't sucker as prolifically as red raspberries, they are usually propagated using a technique called "tip layering."  Tips of new black raspberry canes produced in the summer can be buried in the soil (3-5" deep) in the fall. Firm soil around the tips and water. Rooted tips can be severed from the mother canes (leave 4-6" of the original cane with the roots) the following spring and transplanted to their new locations.<p>
<h3>FERTILIZER</h3>
Preplant phosphorous fertilizer should be broadcast and rototilled into the centers of potential hedgerows at a rate of 0.1-0.2 lb of P2O5 (0.2-0.4 lb of 0-46-0) per 100 sq. ft. Compost incorporated during soil preparation should contain enough organic nitrogen to get new plants off to a good start. Apply potassium only if a soil analysis indicates a potassium deficiency.<p>
Apply nitrogen fertilizer at a rate of 0.05 lb of elemental nitrogen (0.24 lb 21-0-0) per 100 sq. ft. 4-6 weeks after planting as a side dressing (6-8" away from plants, incorporated). Apply nitrogen in following years at rates of 0.1-0.23 lb elemental nitrogen (0.45-1.1 lb 21-0-0) per 100 sq. ft. All nitrogen should be applied in split applications (broadcast or side dressing) -- half in late March and half in early May.<p>
Apply phosphorous to establish planting in the spring at a rate of 0.1-0.2 lb of P2O5 per 100 sq. ft. As phosphorous does not move down through the soil profile with irrigation water, it should be incorporated as a banded application off to the side of the hedge (4-6" from hedgeline) 4-6" deep. Phosphorous can also be applied using a garden fork to punch holes in the soil between canes. Pour the fertilizer into the holes.<p>
Plants that show symptoms of iron or zinc chlorosis should be treated with foliar applications of iron or zinc sulfate. Plants can also be treated with foliar or soil applications of iron or zinc chelates. Only chelated materials should be used for soil applications. Foliar applications of these materials should NOT be applied during flowering because flowers may be burned. Follow label rates for best results.<p>
<h3>WATERING</h3>
Raspberries should never be stressed for moisture as irrigation is particularly critical during bloom and when the berries are sizing. Although sprinklers or furrow irrigation techniques can be used, drip irrigation tends to be more efficient. Because water is generally confined to the root area, weeds are not as prolific in the alleys. Using organic mulches will also help conserve moisture. Organic mulches also tend to cool the soil, as well as reduce soil crusting and weed competition.<p>
<h3>PRUNING AND TRAINING</h3>
Everbearing raspberries tend to be more erect than standard raspberries and rarely need to be trained to a trellis. As berries are produced in the fall on terminal ends of canes produced in the summer of the same year, all canes can be pruned 2-4" from the soil level any time during the winter. No selective pruning is necessary.<p>
Standard raspberries may require some support. Stretching a wire on both sides of the hedge about 3 ft. above the ground will confine canes to the hedge. Place wood or metal posts with supporting crossbars for the wires strategically in the hedge to keep the wires taut. Canes may be attached to the wires with twine.<p>
Canes of standard raspberries can be cut off at ground level after they have fruited in the summer or during the following winter. During the early spring, weaker and smaller canes can also be removed, leaving stronger fruiting canes 6" apart in the hedgerow. Winter-damaged canes can also be removed. Do not top red raspberries during the summer. Hedges of both standard and everbearing types of raspberries should be no wider than 2-3 ft. as wider hedges result in smaller berries and are harder to pick.<p>
Top black and purple raspberries during the summer to encourage the development of lateral branches and to increase cane strength. Canes should be topped when they reach a height of 24-36" by removing 3-4" of growth.<p>
All dead, damaged, or weak black raspberry canes should be removed at ground level during the dormant season. Lateral branches should also be headed back at this time (4-8").<p>
<h3>HARVEST</h3>
Raspberries can be picked every 2-3 days when fruit are well colored and can be pulled off the receptacle or plug quite easily. Collect fruit in a shallow tray to prevent damage. To extend the shelf life of the berries, pick when dry and refrigerate immediately.<p>
<h3>DISEASES</h3>
Raspberries are susceptible to numerous virus diseases. Once they are infected, plants can't be cured. Viruses are commonly spread by aphids, nematodes or infected pollen. To prevent the spread of viruses, destroy all infected plants.<p>
Verticillium wilt is a soil-borne fungus that can be a problem in some areas of New Mexico. When a plant is infected, its leaves turn yellow and eventually die. Canes often turn blue as the disease proceeds up the canes, while vascular tissues generally exhibit red discolorations.<p>
The most effective way to control viruses and Verticillium wilt is to plant certified virus- and Verticillium wilt-free planting stock. Soils should also be free of Verticillium wilt. Raspberries should not be planted in soils that have been planted to potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, strawberries, or other cane berries that have been previously infected with wilt.<p>
Test the soil for nematodes before planting. The root lesion, rootknot, and dagger nematodes will cause weak cane growth and small leaves, and will reduce fruit size. Foliage may also turn yellow and drop in hot weather.<p>
<h3>INSECTS</h3>
Few insect pests have been noted on raspberries in New Mexico, but stinkbugs have been noted in some areas of the state. Gardeners should keep a watch on their raspberries for insect damage. Report new insect infestations to your local county Extension agent for identification and suggested control techniques.<p>
<h3>VARIETIES</h3>
Everbearing raspberry varieties have proved to be the most successful raspberries grown in New Mexico. Because the canes can be damaged by frost in the spring, standard red and black raspberry varieties have only a limited place in the home garden.<p>
<h4>Everbearing Red Raspberries</h4>
'Heritage'--Canes very vigorous, hardy, erect, sturdy; sucker prolifically; medium-sized berry with conic shape, firm flesh, good flavor, and excellent quality; rated number one everbearing red raspberry in nation.<p>
'Redwing'--Canes vigorous, moderately dense, green with light red overlay; berries slightly larger than 'Heritage' at beginning of season but somewhat softer; more heat resistant than 'Heritage' and earlier.<p>
'Autumn Bliss'--Canes moderately numerous, fairly erect, green with pink tinge; berries larger, slightly firm and better tasting than 'Heritage'; earlier ripening.<p>
<h4>Standard Red Raspberries</h4>
'Boyne'--Canes vigorous, erect, sturdy, and very hardy; berries medium-sized, deep red, tender, juicy, aromatic, and medium sweet; good for processing and freezing.<p>
'Nordic'--Canes are less thorny than canes of 'Boyne' and are very hardy; produces fruit both in the summer (last year's canes) and in the fall (this year's canes); fruit similar to 'Boyne' but lighter color with superior firmness, skin strength, and flavor.<p>
'Killarney'--Medium-sized hardy canes; deep red, firm, sweet fruit with excellent quality; slightly larger than 'Boyne', ripens 4-5 days later.<p>
<h4>Black Raspberries</h4>
'Black Hawk'--Plants vigorous, resistant to anthracnose and hardy; fruit medium to large, firm, nearly round, and of good quality and flavor.<p>
'Cumberland'--Canes with many stickers and susceptible to anthracnose; berries large, firm, high quality, and good flavor.<p>
'Jewel'--Canes vigorous, erect, consistently productive; berries large, glossy skin, firm, superior quality and flavor; resistant to anthracnose.<p>
<h4>Purple Raspberries</h4>
'Royalty'--Vigorous canes; large-fruited, sweet berry can be picked in full red to purple stage; very productive.<p>

<h1>Apple Orchard Management in New Mexico</h1>
<h2>Guide H-321</h2>
<h3>Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</h3>

New Mexico apple producers can grow excellent apples. Apple quality depends greatly on good cultural practices--pruning, pollination, fertilization, thinning, irrigation, insect and disease control, and harvesting--as described below. For detailed information on pruning, spraying, fertilizing, and other practices, ask your county Extension agent.<p>
<h3>PRUNING</h3>
Pruning is one of the first steps toward producing high-quality fruit, and pruning ability improves with experience. A good pruner anticipates the response the tree will make to pruning cuts, observing the effects of past treatments on tree growth.<p>
Moderate pruning is usually best. Heavy pruning dwarfs trees delays bearing, and is especially undesirable for young trees.<p>
Proper pruning shapes the tree's structure for life. Prune young trees to establish a strong scaffold system with wide-angled, well-spaced branches that will not split from high winds or heavy crops. A well-trained young tree bears heavy crops early and continues to bear efficiently. <p>
Prune mature trees to: maintain vigorous fruiting wood; allow thorough penetration of insect- and disease-control sprays; permit light penetration for improved fruit color and size; and keep trees at a desirable height for easy picking.<p>
The dormant season is the best time to prune fruit trees, although watersprouts and dead or diseased branches may be removed any time. Prune bearing apple trees regularly, preferably every year; it is a mistake to neglect trees for years and then prune them severely. Old trees, however, can sometimes be rejuvenated with heavier pruning than younger trees require.<p>
<h3>POLLINATING AND FRUIT SET</h3>
New Mexico consumers like 'Red Delicious' apples, a variety that produces only small crops in many areas of New Mexico. Several factors, generally related to poor pollination and fruit set, may be responsible. 'Red Delicious' is also more susceptible to damage from low temperatures just before and during bloom than most other apple varieties.<p>
Because 'Red Delicious' is self-sterile, it must be cross-pollinated with another variety to set fruit. There are several ways to cross-pollinate 'Red Delicious':<p>
<li>Plant a pollinizer; 'Jonathan' is a good variety, and 'Golden Delicious' can also be used. Because one pollinizer may fail to bloom at the right time in some years, planting more than one will ensure pollination.<p>
<li>In solid plantings of 'Red Delicious', graft a pollinator variety onto some trees to increase fruit set. Place bouquets of a pollinizer variety in the orchard until the grafts come into flower.<p>
<li>Place at least one strong hive of honeybees per acre of apples. Pollen inserts may also be used in orchards lacking pollinating varieties.<p>
Fruit set is affected by sunlight, temperature, tree vigor, pollination, and some spray materials used in orchards. The following will help ensure fruit set:<p>
<li>Keep trees growing vigorously; weak trees do not set fruit well.<p>
<li>Apply nitrogen early in the spring so trees absorb it before they bloom; nitrogen applications aid fruit setting.<p>
<h3>FERTILIZING</h3>
Like over-pruning, over-fertilizing may cause fruit to be too large, poorly colored, and susceptible to bitter pit, a disease of stored apples. To produce firm, medium to large apples, prune and fertilize trees consistently from year to year.<p>
<h4>Nitrogen</h4>
Nitrogen is the element most frequently deficient in New Mexico apple orchards. The best indicators of nitrogen deficiency are tree growth and performance: vigorous trees grow 6-10 inches per year and bear good crops regularly. Soil tests alone are not adequate to determine nitrogen needs, but they are useful in determining salt accumulation and mineral toxicities, and may reveal excessive fertilizer applications. Leaf analysis also provides a fairly reliable indication of the nutrient condition of an apple tree.<p>
Fruit trees respond to any form of nitrogen. Do <i>not </i>fertilize apple trees the first year. As a general rule of thumb for young trees, apply 1/4 lb of actual nitrogen per inch of trunk diameter. Do not apply nitrogen to young trees after the middle of June because late applications may prolong growth into the fall, increasing susceptibility to winter injury. <p>
In mature trees, fertilizers may be applied to the soil any time after harvest to help replenish carbohydrates lost to fruit development. For mature, established orchards, apply 150 lb of actual nitrogen per acre (or 750 lb/a ammonium sulfate), half the amount after harvest and the other half before July. <p>
Split applications may provide better results, especially in sandy soils. Adjust application levels up or down, depending upon crop size, amount of annual terminal growth, pruning and cultural practices, and the color, maturity, and quality of the fruit. <p>
Foliage sprays containing nitrogen may increase fruit set, but they do not supply trees with all the nitrogen they require. <p>
<h4>Phosphorous</h4>
Because it is more soluble than other forms, the only form of phosphorus that provides good results for apple orchards is monoammonium sulfate (MAP). Apply about 200 lb/a every other year.<p>
<h4>Minor Elements</h4>
<i>Iron</i>. Due to high pH in New Mexico soils, iron deficiency is the most common nutritional problem in apple orchards. Iron-deficient orchards will show interveinal chlorosis, or yellowed leaves with green veins. Affected trees may be treated with foliar applications of iron chelates, iron sulfate plus uran (foliar urea), or similar compounds; however, this is a temporary measure and does not correct the basic cause. Two application are usually necessary to correct an iron deficiency. Apply the first spray about four weeks after bloom and the second about three weeks later. <b>Note</b>: These sprays may injure pears.<p>
<i>Zinc</I>. The visual symptom of zinc deficiency is small, thin leaves. With acute deficiencies, leaves also appear chlorotic (pale yellow), and new growth is limited to a short rosette. The first symptoms of zinc deficiency in spur-type 'Red Delicious' apples may be limited numbers of small leaves on spurs, poor fruit set, and small fruit. <p>
Because our soil pH is high, zinc deficiency is common in New Mexico and spray applications of zinc are necessary in New Mexico apple orchards. Where zinc levels are known to be low, make annual spray applications at low rates, either after harvest while leaves are still green and active, or early in the spring. Higher rates of zinc can be applied in spring than in fall. With an acute deficiency, both fall and spring applications may be necessary.<p>
If zinc deficiency symptoms appear during the growing season, avoid the use of zinc sulfate because of potential injury to fruit and foliage. Various zinc chelates and organic complexes that reduce the potential for injury are available.<p>
<i>Copper</i>. Copper deficiency will cause terminal leaves on part or most of the tree to turn yellow, wither, and fall. Applying as little as 4 lb copper sulfate (or its equivalent) per acre should correct the symptoms. NOTE: Copper treatments may cause fruit russeting on pear trees.<p>
<h3>THINNING</h3>
Thinning is the process of removing excess fruit from the tree early in the season. Most varieties of apples need thinning, which reduces the tendency toward biennial bearing and helps increase fruit size, color, and quality. Thinning regulates tree load and increases tree "repeat" bloom, or bloom in the next year. Trees that bear average loads year after year produce high quality fruit, while overloaded trees produce poorly colored, small fruit and are weakened by the large crop.<p>
Fruit can be thinned by hand, but labor for hand-thinning is expensive and often unavailable; therefore, chemical thinning is essential for commercial apple growers. Several chemicals have been used successfully for thinning apples, including Ethrel, Sevin, and NAA (naphthalene acetic acid).<p>
Thinning is most necessary in the peripheral areas of a tree and less so on the inside of the tree. One way to thin selectively is through hand sprayers to treat only areas of the tree that require thinning. If a speed sprayer is used, block the lower jets on the air carrier equipment so the spray is directed upward and outward.<p>
<h3>IRRIGATING</h3>
An orchard's water requirements vary from season to season, depending on weather conditions, cover crop, soil type, and fruit load. The best way to determine the need for irrigation is to examine the soil at a depth of 2-3 feet. <p>
Wet orchard soils to a depth of about 3 feet at each irrigation. The time required for water to penetrate to this depth varies with individual orchards and soils. Use a steel rod or soil auger to check the depth of water penetration; in most soils, a rod can be easily pushed into the soil as far as the water has penetrated. Water should penetrate the soil at least 2 1/2 feet.<p>
In young orchards, avoid late and heavy irrigations that may delay maturity and make trees susceptible to winter injury. One or two irrigations are highly recommended during the winter. Avoid wide fluctuations in soil moisture and do not keep soil excessively moist for more than a few hours. <p>
<h3>CONTROLLING PESTS</h3>
A sound pest-control program increases production and improves fruit quality. A practical program consists of good cultural practices plus pest control by appropriate chemicals applied thoroughly at the right time.<p>
Spray failures are often due to improper application (usually too little and too late), rather than the material in the spray tank. Every part of the tree, leaves, and fruit must be covered completely for satisfactory control.<p>
Although chemicals are one of the most effective weapons for combating orchard pests quickly, they should be used only as a supplement to good orchard management-- keeping the orchard clean and healthy. Chemicals are not substitutes for good cultural practices.<p>
Codling moth is by far the most common pest in New Mexico apple orchards. To determine the best time to spray for these moths, use pheromone traps to monitor populations. A computer program based on determining heat unit accumulation can be used to calculate the best time to spray. Contact your county Extension agent for more information about this program.<p>
Powdery mildew is the most common disease in New Mexico apple orchards, and 'Golden Delicious' apples are most susceptible. Apply appropriate control methods early.<p>
<h3>CONTROLLING WEEDS</h3>
The need to control weeds around the base of both young and mature fruit trees has long been recognized, especially as weeds near young trees reduce growth by competing for moisture and nutrients. Weeds also harbor insects, diseases, and rodents and create a nuisance during harvest.<p>
Weeds around trees can be controlled by hand, by mechanical tree hoes, and by chemicals. Chemical herbicides are safe, effective, easy, economical, and a proven method of controlling weeds under trees. Like chemicals for insect control, herbicides must be used at recommended rates and applied according to directions on the label.<p>
Cover crops help control weeds in orchards, as well as improve early color and fruit ripening by reducing the amount of nitrogen available late in the growing season, especially in deep, heavy soils.<p>
Perennial grasses and annual small grain crops are recommended cover crops; however, alfalfa is <i>not </i>recommended. Dwarf grasses such as dwarf orchard-grass are promising cover crops because they need less mowing than other grasses. Because temperatures beneath trees will be lower in orchards with cover crops than in barren orchards, late freeze damage may be higher in orchards with cover crops.<p>
<h3>DETERMINING MATURITY</h3>
Apple quality is largely determined by fruit maturity at harvest. If apples are picked prematurely, fruit is likely to be too small, poorly colored, and off-flavor. Immature fruit is subject to diseases such as bitter pit and soft scald when stored for an extended period. Overmature apples, in addition to having a shorter storage life, have poor storage quality and develop mealy fruit that is susceptible to internal breakdown.<p>
Although the terms <i>maturity </i>and <i>ripeness </i>are often used interchangeably, they are two distinct phases in fruit development. Apples need to complete the maturity stage before they begin ripening, as harvesting immature fruit impedes its progression toward an edible fruit or a good processing condition. Ripeness is related to internal changes in the mature apple leading to better quality development (mainly an increase in sugar content) and improved flavor and aroma. <p>
Deciding when to harvest fruit depends on its final use. If apples are to be sold in a fresh fruit market shortly after harvest, fruit may be allowed to ripen almost entirely on the tree. If fruit is to be held in storage for an extended period, it should be picked earlier.<p>
<h4>Sampling</h4>
For best results, begin sampling to determine fruit maturity five weeks before the earliest expected harvest date. Sample at regular intervals--at least weekly--and on the same day each week if possible. Randomly select at least five trees to represent the current crop; sample four apples from each tree picked at shoulder height, or from each side of the tree.<p>
<h4>Indices of Fruit Maturity</h4>
There are several indices of fruit maturity. Because fruit measurements vary among cultivars, from one tree to another in the same cultivar, among orchards, and from one crop year to the next, no single index provides a consistently dependable guide for harvest maturity year after year. Use a combination of indices to determine maturity. <p>
<i>Ground Color</i>. Ground color in the skin of red apples is the fruit's underlying green or yellow color coming from the amount of chlorophyll showing. Ground color is one of the most useful indices of maturity. In general, fruit advances to maturity as its ground color changes from green to yellow--the exact shade depends on the variety. The following ratings are generally used: dark green, medium green, light green, yellowish green, greenish yellow.<p>
<i>Ease of Separation from the Spur</i>. In most apple varieties, fruit is ready to be harvested when it separates from the spur easily, without breaking the stem, when lifted either with or without a slight rotating movement. <p>
Some varieties like 'McIntosh' and 'Red Delicious' tend to separate from the spur early, thereby dropping to the ground. This fruit drop may increase as a result of early frost or excess nitrogen. Other varieties such as 'Jonathan', 'Stayman', and 'Winesap' retain their fruit until it is overmature. Plant regulators such as Ethrel (Ethephon) and NAA-related chemicals sprayed at the end of the season can alter this maturity index, as Ethrel advances fruit ripening while stop-drop chemicals prevent fruit drop.<p>
<i>Firmness</i>. Fruit flesh becomes softer as apples mature on the tree. Determine firmness by cutting a thin slice of skin and flesh from the apple and using a hand-operated pressure tester to measure the pressure necessary for a 7/16-inch plunger to penetrate the slice. Repeat this process several times with randomly selected apples.<p>
Depending on variety, apples for commercial use are harvested at different firmnesses. If fruit will be in long-term storage, harvest when it is in the higher firmness range. If fruit is for immediate shipping or use (such as for roadside operations), harvest when it is in the lower firmness range. Harvest 'Red Delicious' apples at 15-18 lb of pressure for optimum storage; harvest 'Golden Delicious' apples at 14-17 lb. Apples with a firmness greater than 18 lb are usually immature.<p>
Factors other than maturity such as location of fruit on the tree can affect firmness; use at least one other index in addition to firmness to determine apple maturity.<p>
<i>Soluble Solids Content</i>. As apples mature, juice sugar content increases. Apple soluble solids content, a factor highly correlated with sugar content, is measured with a hand refractometer. Optimum percentage of soluble solids for commercial harvest depends on variety. Harvest 'Red Delicious' apples at about 10%. If fruit will be used immediately, harvest when soluble solids content is around 12%. In general, harvest apples in a 10-12% range for optimum cold-storage quality.<p>
<i>Starch Content</i>. Starch content gradually decreases as the apple matures. Determine starch content by dipping slices of apples in a 75-ml solution of iodine crystals (2.5 gm) plus potassium iodide (10 gm) for one minute. Drain off excess solution and let dry for a few minutes. Starch will react with the iodine and appear as a blue-black pattern. This index is not widely used because it is not very practical and must be performed on apples that have not been stored.<p>
<i>Days from Full Bloom</i>. The period from full bloom to actual harvest is fairly constant for any given variety. The average number of days from full bloom to maturity in five varieties are: 'Jonathan', 135-145; 'Red Delicious,' 145-155; 'Golden Delicious', 150-160; 'Winesap', 160-175; and 'Rome Beauty', 165-175.<p>
<i>Color Development</i>. To use this index, growers must be experienced with the apple variety or strain. Some varieties may be fully colored several weeks before optimum harvest time. Some cultural practices may either hasten or delay fruit color. Excess nitrogen, as well as an iron deficiency, may cause poor fruit color. Potassium applications can improve fruit color when potassium is deficient. Additional color variations may be caused by climatic conditions and soil type, as well as irrigation and various cultural practices.<p>
Grading for 'Red Delicious' apples in the United States is primarily based on percentage of red skin color. Extra-fancy grade apples must have 70% surface area with good color, while fancy grade must be 40%. With a little practice, ratings for individual apples can be made to the nearest 5-10%.<p>
Charts that show coloring for stages of apple maturity are available for yellow apples such as 'Golden Delicious'. 'Golden Delicious' apples progress from dark green to yellow; five ratings are generally used--dark green, green, light green, yellowish green, and greenish yellow. Compare apples in the field against colors on the chart to determine apple maturity<p>
<i>Seed Color</i>. Seeds turn brown or black as they mature inside the fruit. Make ratings for seed color as follows: seed all white, brown color beginning to show on sharp end of seed, 1/4 of seed brown, 1/2 of seed brown, 3/4 of seed brown, and all of seed brown.
<h3>HARVESTING</h3>
Deciding when to harvest is not simple. Experience gained in following fruit development, recorded measurements, and notes on climatic conditions will make this decision easier.<p>
Harvesting is a critical operation in fruit production: an excellent crop can be ruined by careless or inexperienced harvesters and handlers. Provide pickers with proper equipment, as improper picking containers can bruise and cut fruit. Supervise pickers closely to ensure harvested fruit is not bruised and retains its good quality. Harvesting requires a grower's close attention, as it requires more labor than any other operation and high picking costs can absorb the profits from an orchard.<p>

<h1>Vineyard Propagation from Cuttings</H1>
<H2>Guide H-322</H2>
<H3>Estaban Herrera, Extension Horticulture Specialist<BR>
Paul La Vine, Emeritus Viticulturist, Universiy of California</H3>

Growers often would like to increase the number of vines in their vineyards by using their own cuttings. In this way, they can select healthy vines for making cuttings, also saving them money.<P>

In areas like the eastern states where there is an abundance of rainfall and high humidity, many growers start new vineyards by planting cuttings in place. In New Mexico where we do not enjoy that luxury, it is best to grow the cuttings for one year in a nursery and then put them in the permanent location the following year.<P>

<H2>SELECTING THE VINES</H2>
 
The best time for selecting the vines to be used for cuttings is at harvest or just prior to it. Select vines that are well cropped but do not appear to be over-cropped, as overcropping will prevent the wood from being fully matured; the cuttings may take poorly as a result. Mark the vines from which you will be making cuttings.<P>

<H2>TIME FOR CUTTINGS</H2>

While cuttings can be made any time after vines are completely dormant, the best time is when the vineyard is being pruned. Plant cuttings in a nursery so they will form roots for one year before planting them in a permanent site. The cuttings are known as rootings after they develop roots.<P>

<H2>MAKING THE CUTTINGS</H2>

The cutting should be five or six buds long. Do not use cane tips and do not make more than two cuttings from a cane. Wood at the tip of the cane is often less mature and more prone to winter injury, resulting in poor or no root development. On the other hand, old wood has more stored nutrients and will produce more vigorous rootings.<P>

Slant cut at the top; make the one on the bottom straight across, because after cuttings are stored, it is sometimes difficult to tell the top of a cutting from the bottom. If you are making only a few cuttings, it is best to make only mallet cuttings.<P>

The same process is used for making grafting sticks if you plan to do some top-working, but grafting cuttings should be made slightly longer.<P>

<H2>STORING THE CUTTINGS</H2> 

Tie the cuttings in the size bundles that are convenient for your operation. If you are making cuttings from more than one variety, make sure all the bundles are well tagged. Store cuttings in a cold place at temperatures slightly above freezing.<P>

Use moist shavings or peat moss to keep cuttings moist. First wet them well, then drain them enough to remove excess moisture. Generally, moisture is adequate when squeezing a handful of peat moss or shavings leaves your hand moist, not wet.<P>

Lay a piece of plastic on a flat surface, spread a thin layer of shavings, place the cuttings on the shavings, then add another layer of shavings. Roll the package up, folding the sides toward the middle. When the bundle is complete, tie the package.<P>

The packages can be stored in a refrigerator or buried on the north side of a building where water from storm drains does not collect.<P>

If you prefer, cuttings can be buried upside down either in bundles or the wrapped packages. If there is good drainage, you can bury them on the north side of a building--the coldest side. As the soil warms closer to the surface, it aids in callusing the bottoms of cuttings, which will be located near the surface.<P>

If there are a number of cuttings to be stored and you do not have access to a walk-in box or a large refrigerator, cutting pits in the soil work well. Use the procedure mentioned above, but take some extra precautions because of the extreme cold often encountered in New Mexico and cover the cuttings with several inches of soil. As an extra precaution against freezing, loose straw can be placed over the pit to further insulate cuttings against the cold. Remove the straw when the possibility of severe cold weather has passed.<P>
 
If you have access to a walk-in box, cuttings can be stored in a deep box, packing them well in the drained shavings. Often large bundles are made using plastic and moist shavings instead of bins or boxes.<P>

For grafting, it is better to pack the bundles in shavings rather than soil, because the soil particles that stick to the cuttings can quickly dull a knife when the buds are being removed.<P>

<H2>REMOVING THE CUTTINGS FROM STORAGE</H2>

In the spring after the soil shows signs of warming, cuttings can be placed in the nursery. If they are to be used for grafting, continue storing them until you are ready to do the grafting. At no time should they be allowed to dry out.<P>

<H2>LOCATING THE NURSERY</H2>

The nursery should be in a location with accessible water. The soil should be well drained and not receive a lot of runoff water from buildings. If possible, work compost or well-rotted manure into the soil. Some shade is acceptable, but the site should have plenty of sunlight.<P>

If possible the soil should be sterilized by solar heating the soil with a black plastic covering--a process called "solarization." Cultivate the site well and water it well. When the soil is drained, cover the area with 4 mil black plastic if possible. Wet the soil before laying the plastic, as moist heat is much more effective for sterilizating the soil. Seal the cover around the edges with soil; this will help retain the heat, but more importantly the cover will remain through the New Mexico winds. The minimum time for a good solarization is two weeks, but if time allows, leave it for a month or more. The heat generated under the plastic will be sufficient to kill most of the weed seeds in the soil, as well as common pathogenic organisms.<P>

<H2>PLANTING IN THE NURSERY</H2>

Cuttings should be soaked in water for a short time before putting them in the nursery. It is not necessary to use any type of root promoting substance; in fact, these materials may actually reduce grape rooting.<P>

Place the vines in rows in the nursery. The rows should be spaced far enough apart so they can be easily tilled. Place individual cuttings about 4" apart in the row, making sure the cuttings have the slanted cut up.<P>

Use whichever irrigation method is easiest. Sprinklers, furrow, flood, or drip--all work well. The important thing is to give cuttings adequate moisture so they will produce good rootings.<P>

<H2>PURCHASED CUTTINGS OR ROOTINGS</H2>

When dealing with purchased cuttings or rootings, check them as soon as you receive them to make sure they have not suffered from drying out. If necessary re-wet the sawdust or peat moss if you are not yet ready to plant.<P>

Cuttings or rootings can be stored either by placing the bundles in a cold room or by burying them on the north side of a building in a place that is well drained.<P>

Bitter pit is a common disorder in apples grown in New Mexico. This physiological disorder is associated with insufficient calcium in the developing fruit. Bitter pit is not an infectious disease and does not spread from fruit to fruit.<P>

The disorder first appears as small, water-soaked lesions on the surface of the fruit. The spots will gradually turn brown and look like bruises. Spots vary in size (from 2 to 10 mm) depending on the variety. With time, the spot will become sunken and the underlying tissue will become spongy. Spots most frequently occur at the calyx end of the fruit, though the entire fruit is susceptible. Though conditions that lead to bitter pit occur while fruit is on the tree and symptoms can develop on fruit before harvest, the disorder often does not appear until after the fruit has been harvested. Maximum symptom development usually occur within 1-2 months in storage. Affected fruit is bitter.<P>

Any condition that causes calcium to concentrate in the leaves at the expense of the fruit can cause bitter pit. The disorder is more likely to occur on vigorous upright branches with abundant leafy growth because calcium is diverted from developing fruit to the rapidly growing leaves. Other factors contributing to the development of bitter pit include variety susceptibility, poor fruit set, excessive nitrogen or potassium fertilization, and hot, dry growing conditions. In New Mexico, climate plays a major role in the development of bitter pit. The hot, dry climate typical in many locations causes high evapotranspiration rates (movement of water through the plant). That causes calcium to be diverted to the leaves at the expense of the fruit. Once calcium gets into the leaves, it is not easily redistributed to the fruit. Trees that have lost their crop the previous year to frost are also more likely to develop bitter pit the following year.<P>

Cultivars vary in their susceptibility to bitter pit and cultivar selection may be an important consideration in areas likely to have serious bitter pit problems. Apple varieties highly susceptible to bitter pit include Golden Delicious, Jonathan, and Granny Smith. Red Delicious is moderately susceptible. McIntosh and Rome Beauty are two varieties that are fairly resistant to bitter pit.<P>

There is no control for bitter pit once fruit develop symptoms. The best management for this disorder is to use cultural practices that reduce excessive vegetative growth and increase the fruit-to-foliage ratio. Growers should take soil and leaf tissue samples and analyze them for nutrient levels, then develop a fertilization program according to the needs of the trees. It is important to avoid excessive applications of nitrogen and potassium fertilizer. Heavy dormant pruning also should be avoided as it causes excessive growth and light fruit set. In hot, dry climates, potential damage associated with bitter pit and sunscald must be weighed, and trees should be pruned accordingly. For example, if sunscald is of greater concern, trees should be pruned to encourage moderately vigorous growth.<P>

Other management practices recommended to avoid heavy losses due to bitter pit include avoiding early thinning, overthinning, or early harvest. Apples should be stored in a cool, climate-controlled environment. In some areas, summer calcium sprays using calcium nitrate or calcium chloride may be effective in managing bitter pit. Apply at least 3 sprays at one-month intervals beginning mid-June. Take care when applying these materials, as they may cause fruit russeting or leaf burn. Additionally, post-harvest dips in calcium chloride may reduce the amount of bitter pit that develops after harvest.<P>

Strawberries are one of the easiest and most popular small fruit grown in the home garden. Attractive and flavorful, the strawberry is also nutritious. A cup of strawberries will supply more than the recommended human daily requirement of vitamin C with only 55 calories. A bed of 25-50 strawberry plants will produce enough berries for an average-sized family.<p>
<br>
<h2>Botany</h2>
The strawberry (<i>Fragaria ananassa</i>) is an aggregate fruit with seeds or achenes embedded on the surface of a swollen receptacle. The number of cells in a strawberry is determined at the time of flower-bud initiation (previous fall for June-bearers). Size of the berry, however, is mostly influenced by irrigation, which affects the enlargement of the cells.<p>

The perennial, herbaceous, low-growing strawberry plant is composed of leaves, a crown (a compressed, modified stem), and roots. Roots tend to be either semi-permanent (lasting more than one season) or temporary (lasting only days or weeks). Most occur in the upper 3-6 inches of soil, but can reach depths of 12 inches or more in lighter soils. As roots and leaves tend to develop at a higher level on the crown each year, root contact with the soil tends to decrease with time. The elevated plant tends to push itself out of the ground.<p>

Inflorescences (flowers) develop from terminal buds on the plant. Plants with branched crowns (induced by short-days) may form multiple inflorescences. Lower temperatures (below 60&#176;F) will also induce flower bud formation. Flower bud formation is generally inhibited when day/night temperatures exceed 72&#176;/70&#176;F.<p>

Strawberries generally propagate vegetatively by producing runners (stolons). Runners arise from buds at the base (axils) of the leaves, in response to longer-days (more than 12 hours of sunlight) in June-bearing strawberries. Longer days occur from June through August. Day-neutral varieties generally produce fewer runners, so they should be planted closer together in the bed.<p>
<br>
<h2>Strawberry Types and Cultivars</h2>
There are basically three types of strawberries: June-bearers, everbearers, and day-neutrals. They differ primarily in their response to day length, which affects both berry and runner production.<p>

<h3>June-bearers</h3>
June-bearers develop flowers in the early spring from buds initiated the previous fall under short-day conditions (less than 10 hours of light per day). It is essential during the fall (September-November) that the plants have a full, well-developed leaf canopy to produce sufficient energy for flowers to bud. June-bearers tend to outproduce other types of strawberries, but the crops are often lost due to late frosts in the spring. June-bearers are better adapted to warmer growing areas of the state.<p>

<i><b>Cultivars</b></i>

<dt>'Tufts'
<dd>large, long, wedged-shaped fruit; high yields; fair dessert but good freezing quality; susceptible to red stele.<p>
</dl>
<br>
<h3>Everbearers</h3>
Everbearers initiate flower buds under long-day conditions (more than 12 hours of sunlight). They will generally produce two main crops (spring and fall), but yield less than a single spring crop from a June-bearer. Everbearers, however, that lose a spring crop to frost will still produce a fall crop. Everbearers produce fewer runners and tend to form multiple crowns. Everbearers do not tolerate heat well, so they should be grown in the northern part of the state.<p>

<i><b>Cultivars</b></i>

</dl>
<br>
<h3>Day-neutrals</h3>
Day-neutral strawberries have the unique ability to flower and fruit under any day-length conditions. They will produce fruit from spring through fall with several peaks throughout the season. Temperatures above 70&#176;F, however, will inhibit flower bud formation. Day-neutrals produce fruit and runners simultaneously, although runner production is generally less than that of June-bearers. Day-neutral runners often flower before initiating roots, which makes them excellent container plants, especially as hanging house plants in the winter.<p>

<i><b>Cultivars</b></i>

<h2>Site Selection</h2>

Strawberry blossoms are susceptible to late spring frosts, which can kill early flowers. Since early blossoms produce the largest berries, this can be a serious problem. Locating strawberry beds on elevated areas of the garden with gentle slopes will allow heavy cold air to drain away from the bed, helping to reduce frost damage. A northern exposure may help delay bloom in the spring if late frosts are a problem. Earlier production can be achieved by selecting a southern exposure that warms earlier in the spring. Plants may have to be covered with a straw mulch or blanket at night to protect them if frost becomes a problem. Locations next to a house are often warmer due to heat generated from the home.
Strawberries prefer full sun, although afternoon shade may be needed in warmer areas of the state. However, shady locations can cause more vegetative plants with fewer berries and cause more disease problems.<p>

Avoid planting strawberries after peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, or okra, all of which are susceptible to Verticillium wilt. Sites planted to strawberries following sod may have to be treated to control white grub. Sites should also be free of noxious weeds.<p>
<br>
<h2>Soil Preparation</h2>

Strawberries prefer well-drained, sandy loam soils high in organic matter and fertility. Soils should be neutral to slightly acidic (pH 6.5) in nature. Plants established on more alkaline soils (pH of 7.5 or greater) tend to exhibit signs of iron deficiency (interveinal chlorosis of younger leaves). In severe cases, pale leaves become white, turn brown around the edges, and then die. Strawberry plants are also highly sensitive to salt. High total salt levels will cause stunting, marginal leaf scorch, and severe yield reduction. Enough water should be applied to ensure that salts are leached below the root zone.<p>

The soil should be prepared well in advance of planting. Incorporate organic matter (2-3 inches of garden compost) in the bed to a depth of at least 12 inches. Organic matter will help improve nutrient availability as well as the structure and water-holding capacity of the soil.<p>

Soil drainage can be improved by planting on raised beds (36 inches wide and 3-4 inches high). Raised beds will warm sooner in the spring than flat ground. However, planting on flat ground may be preferred where salts are a problem, making it necessary to flood the beds occasionally to move salts down through the soil profile.<p>
<br>
<h2>Fertilization</h2>

Before planting, approximately 1.0 lb/100 sq ft of 12-24-12 fertilizer should be incorporated into the planting bed to a depth of 6-8 inches. The rate will depend on the results of a soil analysis. Additional nitrogen may be necessary once new growth begins in the spring and again 3-4 months later at a rate of 1/2 lb/100 sq ft of ammonium sulfate (21-0-0) per application. Scatter the fertilizer evenly across the bed and work it into the soil. Wash fertilizer off plant leaves to prevent leaf burn. Irrigate the bed after application. Fertilization is important the first year to encourage good growth.<p>

During the second and following growing seasons, plants should not be fertilized until after harvest in the spring. A balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) can then be applied at a rate of 1-1/2 lb/100 sq ft. Applying nitrogen fertilizers before harvest can result in soft, tasteless berries that easily rot. Plants can also become too leafy, more susceptible to disease, and tend to shed blossoms. Additional fertilizer probably will not be necessary if plants remain dark green. Applying too much nitrogen in the fall to established beds can make plants more susceptible to winter kill problems.<p>

Iron chlorosis problems can be corrected with a foliar application of either iron sulfate or an iron chelate. Foliar applications should be made in the spring before flowering or between flowering periods (everbearing and day-neutral types). Foliar applications during flowering can damage flowers. For longer lasting results, use soil applications of iron chelates. Follow label directions for best results.<p>
<br>
<h2>Planting</h2>

Plants should be ordered early in the winter before spring planting to ensure the availability of appropriate cultivars. Buy only certified virus-free plants that have been inspected for pests and bred for disease resistance. Beds should be prepared well in advance of your scheduled planting date.<p>

Planting in the spring (after danger of hard frost) ensures greater plant survival because the weather is cool. Plants should be dormant and healthy upon arrival. Crowns should be solid with light-colored roots. If new plants arrive early, plants can be stored at 29-30&#176;F and 85-90 percent relative humidity (wrapped in moist packing materials). This should prevent the growth of mold. Plants can also be "healed-in" in the garden for temporary storage. To heal in the plants, place them in a shallow trench, cover the roots with soil, then water them.<p>

Do not allow the plant roots to dry out during planting operations. Roots can be placed in water for up to 1/2 hour before planting. Keeping plants in the shade will also reduce stress.<p>

Trim roots to 4-6 inches long. Prune off older damaged leaves, leaving one or two good leaves. Spread the remaining roots evenly in the planting hole. The crown (where leaves are attached) should be level with the surface of the soil. If planted too shallow, the roots will dry out. When planted too deep, the plants will rot. Firm the soil over the roots and around the base of the crown so no air pockets occur. Water plants immediately. One pint of fertilizer starter solution around each plant will help promote early growth. A starter solution can be made of one cup of 12-12-12 or 12-24-0 per 10 gallons of water.<p>
<br>
<h2>Training</h2>

Strawberries can be trained to either a matted row system or a hill system. Choice of training system is generally dependent upon the type of strawberry and personal preference.<p>

In a matted row system, plants are generally spaced 18-24 inches apart in rows with 36- to 42-inch centers. Runners are allowed to develop to fill the empty spaces between plants until the rows are 12-18 inches wide. The middles between rows are kept free of plants. Four to six runners per plant are allowed to develop. The runners are arranged along the row and spaced 8-10 inches apart. Runners are placed in the desired location and gently pressed into the soil (1/2 inch deep) where daughter plants form. Runners can also be held in place by placing a carpenter's staple over the runner near the base of the daughter plant. Do not sever the daughter plant from the mother plant. After sufficient runner plants have formed, pinch off any new runners that develop. During the following growing season, all new runners should be removed.<p>

The matted row system is generally used for June-bearers. During the first growing season, remove (pinch out) flower stalks before the blossoms appear. Allowing blossoms and fruit to form will reduce the vigor of the new plants. Blossoms and fruit can be allowed to form the following spring. The biggest problem with the matted row system is that too many plants can form, which can result in smaller berries and poor yields.<p>

The hill system is generally used for both everbearing and day-neutral types of strawberries. Plants are generally spaced 12-15 inches apart in the row. The runners are removed as they form and the plants remain distinct units. With age, plants are allowed to form runners that can be selectively placed in an alternate fashion to replace older plants. Rows are generally spaced 2 feet apart. During the first growing season, the flowers are generally removed in the spring but can be allowed to set berries in the fall. Hill-trained strawberries generally produce larger berries than the matted row system.<p>
<br>
<h2>Management</h2>

Mulches are often used in strawberry production to reduce soil moisture evaporation, reduce weed growth, prevent mud from splashing on berries, reduce fruit rots, protect plants from freezing, and to control soil temperatures. Choice of mulch depends on the type of strawberry you're growing, growing season characteristics, and management objectives.<p>

Organic mulches are often used with June-bearing strawberries (matted row system) in warmer areas of the state to help cool the soil. Clean straw (free of weed seed) and pine needles tend to keep berries clean and dry. Do not use lawn clippings, which tend to mat and attract pests such as snails, slugs, and sowbugs. Runners can be easily manipulated to root down through the mulch.<p>

White plastic (non-translucent) mulches can be used with everbearing and day-neutral varieties that form fewer runners and are planted closer together. White plastic, like organic mulches, tends to cool the soil in warmer areas of the state.<p>

Black plastic or black woven plastic fabric (weed barriers) can be used in colder areas of the state to help warm the soil (for earlier harvest) and to keep plants from freezing. Woven fabrics are preferred, as they allow the soil to "breath" and water to penetrate. Drip irrigation can be used under either plastic or fabric for optimum irrigation efficiency.<p>

When using plastic or fabrics, a hill system planted with everbearing and day-neutral cultivars is preferable because runners are discouraged.<p>

Straw mulch can also be used in northern New Mexico to protect plants from freezing in the winter. A 3-4 inch straw mulch should be applied after frost in early winter and should not be removed until after new growth (2 inches) begins in the spring. The new growth will be yellow-green. Removing the mulch earlier than this could result in frost damage to the blossoms. Approximately half the mulch can be pulled down along the sides of the beds, allowing the plants to grow up through the remaining mulch.<p>

Strawberries grown in warmer areas of the state will require some shade in the afternoon during the summer. This will reduce heat and water stress to both plants and fruit. Erect a shade cloth (65 percent shade) over the bed, or plant on the east side of a fence or wall.
Due to the shallow root system of the strawberry plant, irrigation should be relatively frequent. Irrigation water containing over 640 ppm total salts can cause salt burn on the leaves if it is allowed to accumulate in the soil. This can be a problem when drip irrigation is used. Flooding the bed occasionally will help move salts down through the soil profile below feeder roots. Whatever irrigation technique is used, enough water should be applied with each irrigation to wet the soil to a depth of at least 12 inches.<p>

Strawberries require bees for pollination. No insecticides should be applied during bloom because they can kill bees. Catfacing or irregularly shaped fruit is often the result of poor pollination from either poor bee populations or damage from cold weather.<p>

After harvest in the spring, June-bearing strawberry beds should be renovated. The main objectives of renovation are to replace old leaves with new foliage, improve sunlight penetration, fertilize for berry enlargement, control weeds, and to topdress with soil over crowns for improved root production.<p>

Renovation of strawberry beds can be accomplished with a rotary mower, removing old foliage just above the crowns. Be careful not to damage crowns. Do not renovate after July 15, as there may not be enough time for new leaf production. Older, less productive plants can be replaced with new runners. Row width should be maintained at 12-18 inches, with an optimum plant density of 5-6 plants/sq ft. Topdress beds with 1/2-1 inch of soil and a balanced fertilizer (refer to fertilizer section). Most plantings will last 3-4 years using this technique.<p>
<br>
<h2>Harvest and Storage</h2>

Pick berries in the morning when it's cool to prolong shelf life. The surface of the berry should be dry to prevent fruit rot. As berries will not continue to ripen after harvest, pick them when fully ripe (dark red). Be sure to remove any overripe, diseased, or insect-damaged fruit to keep plants producing. The time from bloom to harvest will vary from 18-45 days depending on variety, temperature, and exposure to sunlight.<p>

Berries should be harvested every other day to maintain quality. Most June-bearers will yield berries for 10-15 days. Harvest by cupping the berry between your fingers and snapping both the berry and hull cleanly off the plant. Keep berries out of the sun, and refrigerate unwashed until needed. Strawberries can be stored 2-6 days at 33-34&#176;F (high humidity). Berries can be hulled and cleaned when ready to eat, freeze, or process.<p>
<br>
<h2>Pests</h2>

White grubs, spider mites, slugs, snails, and sowbugs can be major problems on strawberries. White grubs (June beetle larva) are 3/4-inch long, with brown heads and white, c-shaped bodies. They generally feed on roots of weaker plants. Grubs are generally a bigger problem when strawberries follow a sod crop.<p>

Spider mites are very tiny, light-colored bugs that can build up on the leaves, making them dirty and gritty. Spraying the plants with a strong jet of water tends to discourage them.<p>

Slugs, snails, and sowbugs tend to build up in beds with organic mulches. Using synthetic plastic mulches and baits that attract these pests away from the bed can be effective controls.<p>

Plant diseases are generally the biggest problems most home gardeners encounter in growing strawberries. Major diseases include nematodes, Verticillium wilt, Botrytis gray mold, black root rot, red stele, and various viruses.<p>

Generally more abundant in sandy soils, nematodes, particularly the dagger nematode (<i>Xiphinema americanum</i>), can cause stunted plants. As the roots do not swell (a typical symptom of rootknot nematode), they are generally hard to detect. Chemical fumigation of the soil is the most effective means of control. Placing clear plastic over a damp, well-rototilled bed in the summer before planting will help to solarize the soil and reduce nematode populations. Adding organic matter (compost) during bed preparation also tends to discourage these microscopic worms.<p>

Verticillium wilt can be a problem in some soils. This soil-borne fungus causes outer leaves of the strawberry plant to dry up, first around the margins and then between the veins. New leaves are often greatly retarded, making the plants look flattened and stunted. Shoots will often have blackened tips. Severe infection will cause collapse of the entire plant. Symptoms generally occur in the mother plant, not in the runners. Plant in noninfected soil, fumigate soils, and use resistant cultivars.<p>

Botrytis gray mold can be a very destructive disease on strawberry fruit, particularly when the humidity is high or air movement around plants is restricted. Mold will generally cover the blossoms on developing green fruit, especially when they touch the ground, another berry, or a dead leaf. The dusty gray mold will eventually cover the entire fruit. Avoid heavy foliage cover that impedes air flow around the plants. Nitrogen should only be applied after harvest in the spring. Light mulches (straw, pine needles, plastic) will help keep the berries off the soil and decaying vegetation.<p>

Black root rot is a name for several root and crown rot diseases, the most common being <i>Pythium</i> spp. These soil-borne fungi cause plants to decline in vigor and productivity, with often poorly developed, black root systems. Cutting vertically through the crown will often reveal discolored (dark) tissue. Control involves crop rotation and a balanced fertilizer program for good growth.<p>

Red stele (<i>Phytophthora</i>) is generally more prevalent in heavy, poorly drained soils. Inner cores of infected roots are generally red. Leaves may be off-color. Infected plants will wilt and die quickly during the hot summer. Well-drained soils and planting resistant cultivars are the best controls.<p>

Viruses can reduce plant vigor without any notable symptoms, although some plants can become small and spindly, or produce a multiple number of crowns with small leaves. Aster yellows, spread by leafhoppers, will result in symptoms similar to 2,4-D damage with yellow, cupped leaves. Controls include planting virus-free plants, roguing sick plants, and controlling insects.<p>

Other pests include weeds and birds. Weeds can be controlled with various mulches or pulling by hand. Birds are best controlled with netting spread across the beds.<p>

<h1>The Culture of Lilacs</h1>
<h2>Guide H-401</h2>
<h3>M. Douglas Bryant, Extension Horticulturist Emeritus</h3>
Lilacs are well adapted to New Mexico conditions. They prefer neutral to slightly alkaline soil. They are tolerant to cold and have survived 60ö below zero. They are long-lived, and their culture presents no special difficulties. A favorable site and timely care, however, enhance the attractiveness of the plants.<p>

<h4>Sites</h4>
Select a well-drained soil in a sunny location. Lilacs are adapted to many garden uses: in sunny borders with smaller shrubs; as specimen plants--alone or against a background of taller growth; as screen plantings; and in groups or singly near corners of buildings. Common lilac and Persian lilac make excellent informal hedges. Modern varieties are particularly well suited for prominent locations in large gardens and public parks.<p>

<h4>Soil</h4>
Lilacs grow best in loam, but they also do well in other soils. They are gross feeders and respond favorably to applications of barnyard manure and commercial fertilizers.
Fertilize young plants regularly until they produce a good root system and begin to flower. On sandy soils, apply fertilizer each spring to aid flower production. Where soil is fertile enough to produce strong growth, additional plant food may not be necessary. If the soil is too rich, plants grow luxuriantly but may not produce a corresponding display of flowers.<p>

<h4>Planting</h4>
Lilacs grown on their own roots are usually superior to grafted ones. Strong nursery-grown plants two to four feet tall are good sizes to buy. Bare-root plants of this size can be transplanted. Much larger, wide-spreading plants can be moved with balls of soil held by burlap. Young, rooted sprouts around bushes can also be transplanted. It is best to grow them in a nursery or garden for two or three years before transplanting them to a permanent location.<p>
Transplant lilacs after the leaves fall in autumn until the ground freezes, and in spring before the buds start to unfold. Autumn transplanting is best in that new roots start growth before buds become active, but spring planting may be best where winters are severe.<p>
Space plants six or seven feet apart. Holes should be large enough to accommodate all the roots without bending or breaking. Set the plant two or three inches deeper than it grew before and work fresh topsoil around the roots. Allow it to soak in water, then add more rich loam to fill the hole. A mulch of leaves or straw three to four inches in depth during the first year is helpful in conserving moisture.<p>

<h4>Maintenance</h4>
Lilacs require only moderate moisture and endure dry weather better than most shrubs. Do not overwater. They do not tolerate excessively wet or poorly drained soil. Shallow cultivation keeps down weeds and unwanted root sprouts.<p>
Multiple branching from the base permits removal of older stems that get too tall or are damaged by borers. Little pruning is needed the first three or four years. When branches begin to crowd, thin weak, interior growth moderately. Prune after flowers have fallen. Winter pruning destroys flower buds. When cutting flowers, take long stems to keep plants from growing too tall. Remove sprouts not wanted for renewal stems. Old, neglected bushes require more severe pruning. Prevent severe loss of flowering wood by removing one-third of the old stems at ground level each year for three years.<p>
Remove seed heads soon after flowering for more profuse flowering the succeeding year.<p>

<h4>Propagation</h4>
Lilacs are propagated by seed, cuttings, grafts, buds, layers, and root sprouts. Seed of different varieties will not reproduce true to the parent. Seed of good named varieties produce seedlings with attractive flowers but rarely equal to those of the parents.<p>
Plant seed in early fall outdoors in a protected bed where the seedlings are to grow or in pots which are wintered in a cold-frame. Cover the seed about one-half inch deep. They germinate a few weeks after the soil becomes warm in spring. The first summer, seedlings may grow six or eight inches and be strong enough to be set in the open nursery. They normally develop to flowering size in four to six years.<p>
Nurserymen use cuttings and grafts to increase named varieties. Cuttings of soft wood require much care. They develop slower than buds or grafts, but the plants are better. Cuttings are rooted in sand in a greenhouse or glass-covered frames where air can be kept moist. Cuttings must be taken while growth is most active, soon after flowering and before new terminal buds have formed. Make cuttings three or four inches long and remove all leaves except at the tip. After planting, water them well. Restrict later watering to light, daily sprinkling. Air is kept humid. A canopy for shade is necessary to prevent over-heating. Cuttings should be rooted by midsummer and can be potted and set in the nursery the following spring. These plants normally flower in three to four years.<p>
Most commercially propagated varieties are grafted. For stocks, fast-growing varieties of privet, such as Ibota and California, are used. They are only for nurse roots, since lilacs do better on their own roots. Grafted plants do not produce suckers as profusely as plants from cuttings or seed.<p>
Whipgraft four- to five-inch scions close to the stock roots, so the unions are a few inches below the surface. This produces scion roots within a year or two. On some varieties, scion rooting may not occur for a long time, resulting in dwarfed plants.<p>
Graft lilacs in late winter, while stocks and scions are dormant. Completed grafts are packed in moist sand, moss, or sawdust, and stored in a cool place until planting in early spring.<p>
For forcing, growing in pots, or dwarfs, lilacs are budded on privet. Budding is done in August and September, with the shield bud method. The inserted buds remain dormant until the following spring when privet stocks are cut off just above the bud. Growth is rapid, often two or three feet the first season. Flower buds usually develop in the second season.<p>
The lilac, like many other shrubs, can be propagated by layering. This is a good method for the home gardener but too slow and cumbersome for mass production. Branches are brought down to the ground in spring and covered with soil, leaving only the tips above ground. Well-rooted plants may be obtained by this means in two seasons. They are then cut and grown in the garden for two or three years to develop into sturdy, blooming-size shrubs.<p>
Some varieties produce suckers freely after they are established on their own roots. These root-sprouts may be dug up in fall and transferred to the garden or nursery where they will make satisfactory plants in a few years. This is the usual way of propagating the common line.<p>

<h4>Varieties</h4>
The first lilac to bloom in the spring is a large-leaved species, <i>Syringa oblata</i>, from which several early-blooming hybrids with <i>S. vulgaris</i> have been developed. Among the most noteworthy of these are Claude Bernard, double mauve; Descartes, single lilac; Lamartine, single mauve; Mirabeau, single rosy lilac; Louvois, single purplish. They bloom a week or two earlier than most lilacs.
Most of the well-known varieties are derived from the common lilac, <i>Syringa vulgaris</i>, which has been a favorite for centuries in Europe and America. It is still worthy of a place in the garden, even with the best of its progeny. Modern varieties extend the color range, size, petalage, and growth characteristics. There are many varieties, and many are quite similar. Choice is largely a matter of personal preference. Varieties offered in nursery catalogs are selections of the best.<p>
Following are some of the better varieties of lilacs:<p>

Violet: <b>Single,</b>, Cavour de Mirribel. <b>Double</b>, Marechal Lannes.<p>

Blue or Bluish: <b>Single</b>, Jacques Callot, William C. Barry. <b>Double</b>, President Fallieres, Leon Gambetta.<p>

Pink: <b>Single</b>, Lucie Baltet (lamed for the hint of salmon on first opening but quickly lost in hot sun), Macrostachya. <b>Double</b>, Katherine Havemeyer (the most double of all and the largest inflourescence, considered handsome by some, grotesque by others), Mme. Antoine Buchner, Waldeck-Rousseau.<p>

Magenta: <b>Single</b>, Marechal Foch, Mme. F. Morel, Congo, Ruhm von Horstenstein. <b>Double</b>, Paul Thirion, Paul Deschanel, Charles Joly, President Poincare.<p>

Purple: <b>Single</b>, Monge (best grower in this group), Mrs. W. E. Marshall, Ludwig Spaeth, Volcan, Toussaint-Louvertune (possibly the darkest of all), Vesuve, Turene. <b>Double</b>, Adelaide Dunbar, Paul Harlot.<p>

Lutece, from <i>Syringa henryi</i>, is quite distinct from the preceding sorts, notable for late flowers and robust, symmetrical growth. It is large, round-headed and requires at least 20 feet to develop properly.<p>
The Chinese lilac, <i>Syringa chinensis</i>, is rather tall with smaller foliage than the common lilac and profuse flowers which give a lace-like effect in mass.<p>
The Persian lilac, <i>Syringa persica</i>, is smaller than the Chinese, with leaves often divided. Its relatively compact branching habit commends it for hedges.<p>
The littleleaf lilac, <i>Syringa microphylla</i>, is distinctive with small leaves; round, low-bush form; and late flowers.<p>
The tree lilacs, <i>Syringa amurensis </i>and <i>S. amurensis japonica</i>, become small trees, sometimes 25 feet tall, with huge panicles of white, privet-like flowers blooming in early summer. They are speculator in bloom and the foliage is pleasing all season.<p>

<h4>Pests</h4>
Several insects and diseases attack lilacs but only a few inflict severe injury. The most common pests are oyster-shell scale and San Jose scale. Heavy infestations weaken the flower-bearing stems. They are easily controlled by spraying, during dormancy, with miscible oil or lime-sulfur.<p>
Borers usually attack weakened, older stems but may cause trouble on normal, healthy plants. They can be dug from the stems or killed by probing the burrows with a wire. If burrowing is extensive, cut and destroy the infested stems. Mildew may appear on leaves in August and September. Although its appearance is unsightly it does little harm and can be controlled by spraying with Bordeaux mixture, wettable sulfur, dusting sulfur or Karathane.<p>

<h1>Poinsettias: Year After Year</h1>
<h2>Guide H-406</h2>
<h3>Reviewed by Lynn Ellen Doxon</h3>

Poinsettias <i>(Euphorbia pulcherrima) </i>can be kept year after year, and they will bloom each year if you give them proper care.<p>
When the leaves begin to yellow or when the plant is no longer desired as an ornamental, gradually withhold water. The leaves will pale and fall, and the bracts will be the last to go. (Figure 1 shows the parts of the plant.) After all the leaves have fallen, store the plant, in its pot, in a cool (50ö to 60ö F, which is 10ö to 15ö C), dry, dark area. Keep the plant on the dry side. Water only to keep the stems from withering.<p>
In April or May, bring the plant out of storage. Cut the main stems six inches above soil level. Remove the pot and the old soil from the roots. Repot the plant in fresh medium having good drainage, such as equal parts of good garden loam, peat moss, and perlite. Poinsettias are susceptible to stem and root diseases if the soil is heavy and retains excess moisture. Soak the soil well, then allow all excess water to drain away. Place the plant in a warm, sunny spot for renewed growth. Keep the humidity high to encourage rapid new growth. Once the plant is growing actively, apply a weak fertilizer solution (one tablespoon of a soluble fertilizer, such as 20-20-20 or its equivalent, per gallon of water) at monthly intervals.<p>
After frost danger is past, sink the pot into a protected and sunny bed. Light shade is ideal during the hottest part of the day. Lift the pot occasionally to prevent root growth into surrounding soil. If the plant becomes root bound, repot it into a larger pot. Watch for insects and control them promptly.<p>
Keep the poinsettia actively growing all summer by watering and fertilizing regularly. When the top soil feels dry, liberally apply water, and allow the excess to drain away. Add no more water until the top of the soil is dry again.<p>
To obtain a bushy plant, pinch new shoots back so that at least two nodes remain on each. (See figure 2.) Continue pinching new shoots until late August. Remove weak stems completely, so only a few of the stronger ones develop.<p>
If more plants are desired, try propagating poinsettias from stem cuttings taken in place of pinchings When the new growth is 8 to 12 inches high, cut off 4 to 6 inches for rooting. (See figure 3.) Leave at least two leaves on both the cuttings and the parent stem for production of food. Cut in the morning, and place the cut stem in tepid water for one hour to stop the "bleeding." Place the cuttings in a well-drained, moist rooting medium, such as half perlite and half peat moss. Keep humidity high for rapid rooting. Place cuttings in bright, but not direct, light. Pot into a well-drained soil when the new roots are about 1/2 inch long. Care of these plants is the same as care for the parent plant.<p>
The parent plant and all rooted cuttings will bloom at the same time. The thicker cuttings will produce larger blooms. Make as many cuttings as desired until late August, but remember, only strong stems produce strong plants.<p>
As cool. fall weather begins, take the plant inside to a south window with full sun. Poinsettias do best in full fall sun and the bracts (apparent "petals") obtain their deepest color in good light. Ventilation is important, but keep the plant away from drafts. Drafts, as well as low temperatures, waterlogged soil, and drought, can cause the lower leaves of the poinsettia to yellow and fall. Night temperatures of 60ö to 65ö F and day temperatures up to 75ö F are recommended. If the night temperature is too high or too low, the plant is likely to flower later.<p>
The poinsettia is known as a true short-day (or long-night) plant. This means that the plant must be in total darkness for about 14 hours out of every day for a four-week period to form flower buds. Beginning late September or early October, make certain the poinsettia receives no artificial light after nightfall. Even brief periods of light from a single light bulb for one night may be enough to delay or interfere with flowering. If possible, keep the plant in a room without lights, in a dark closet, or under a fully lightproof cover from about 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., every day for four weeks.<p>
Remember to put the plant in a sunny window in the daytime, and drench the soil when the surface is dry. It will probably need watering less often now. Continue fertilizing it monthly until mid-December. The opened flowers last longest at about 65ö F.<p>

<TITLE>Fertilizers, Weed Management and Pest Control in Growing Christmas Trees</title>
</head>

<h1>Fertilizers, Weed Management and Pest Control in Growing Christmas Trees</h1>
<h2>Guide H-411</h2>
<h3>Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist<br>
Richard Lee, Extension Weed Specialist<br>
Robert Cain, Extension Forest Entomologist</h3>

Successful Christmas tree growers apply herbicides, insecticides and fertilizers as needed for optimum tree growth. However, these agricultural chemicals should be used carefully; follow label directions exactly to avoid damage to trees and the environment.<p>

<h3>Fertilization</h3>

Tree-growing operations use fertilizers to increase growth, and to improve the trees' vigor, color and needle density. If any of these factors is not adequate, or if trees are spindly and off-green, fertilization is needed. Most New Mexico soils do not contain enough nitrogen, and adding this element usually corrects the problem.<p>
Studies show fertilizer applied to new plantings can burn tree roots and cause other injury. Fertilization should begin the second year after planting, and should be done in spring before buds begin to swell. Spread 3 to 4 heaping tablespoons of ammonium sulfate per tree in early spring. Scatter the fertilizer evenly under the drip line, but never in direct contact with the tree's root system. Be careful not to concentrate large amounts of fertilizer near the stem. Split the application in sandy soils, applying half in spring and the other half in late June.<p>
Fertilization benefits are carried over into the next season's growth, so fertilizer is needed only every other year. Double the rate for the second and third applications (fourth and sixth years), and use double the rate (6 to 8 heaping tablespoons) in July of the harvest year to improve color and marketability.<p>
Large-scale applications should not be made throughout the tree plantation until enough small trials have proven how effective nitrogen fertilizers will be under local conditions. Observation of the trees' response to fertilizers should tell the grower how to gauge application rates. Rates recommended here are low and may need to be increased on some sites; however, no more than 4 heaping tablespoons per tree should be applied the second year to avoid damage to young trees.<p>
In established trees, good results have been obtained with about 50 g/tree of nitrogen on a semiannual basis. At a stocking rate of 3,000 trees/ha, this would require 150 kg/ha (750 kg of ammonium sulfate). Split the rate, applying half in March and the other half in June.<p>
Fertilizers that increase tree growth will also stimulate growth of grass and weeds. Use of fertilizers should be coupled with a weed control program and timely applications of irrigation water.<p>

<h3>Weed Management</h3>

Controlling weeds in Christmas tree plantations can be done either with herbicides or by cultivation. Each approach has its own problems.<p>
When using a herbicide for the first time, pick an area in the plantation for a small-scale test. Herbicides work differently under different conditions, and different tree species respond differently to a given herbicide. It's important to read, understand and follow herbicide label directions. The label will identify the different tree species that can be grown safely while using that herbicide.<p>
Cultivation to control weeds near the trees can injure the roots or the young trees themselves. Cultivation also creates favorable conditions for weeds to germinate near the soil surface, and can bring new weed seeds up from deeper in the soil profile. Cultivation can also spread perennial weeds by breaking up and scattering parts of the weed plant's structure that can reproduce. Finally, cultivation offers no residual control, and soil can be compacted by repeated equipment passes through the plantation.<p>
Herbicides require less physical effort to get an acceptable level of control, but application rates will vary with the soil type, the spectrum of weeds growing in the plantation, growth stage of the trees and timing of the application. Timing defines whether the herbicide is applied before or after weeds emerge. Again, label information is important. The herbicide label will identify weeds that can be controlled, and will list the tree species where that herbicide can be used safely.<p>
Figure 1 categorizes the different herbicide options for weed control in plantations, in relation to the different stages of Christmas tree production.<p>

<h3>Controlling Insects</h3>

Serious insect problems can be avoided by combining mechanical, biological and chemical controls. Native conifers planted at elevations lower than where they normally grow can suffer from too much or too little moisture, soil compaction, alkalinity, and exposure to sun and wind. Trees that become stressed or weakened by any of these conditions are attractive hosts for many insects. Watching for and correcting environmental stresses can prevent or reduce many insect problems.<p>
Minor pest infestations can be mechanically removed by spraying with a strong stream of water or by pruning, or the insects can simply be tolerated. However, when plantation monitoring indicates a serious pest problem, direct control with pesticides should be considered. Whether using chemical or microbial insecticides, always check the pesticide label to make sure it is registered for use under conditions that exist on that site. Also, check state and local regulations before applying any pesticide because regulations  are constantly being reviewed  and changed.<p>
The poisonous nature of pesticides requires strict adherence to recommended dosages and to precautions for handling and use. County Extension agents, state Extension specialists, or state and federal pest management specialists can be consulted for up-to-date information on insecticides. Trade names in this publication are used only to give specific information, and mention of a trade name does not constitute a recommendation, guarantee or warranty of the product by the Cooperative Extension Service, NMSU.<p>

<b>Scales</b>   Overwintering, immature scales can be killed by spraying trees with dormant or superior oil before buds break. Dormant oils should not be used after buds begin expanding, and improper use of oils can cause injury to foliage. Dormant oils may remove the waxy bloom on blue spruce, causing discolored foliage.<p>
Insecticide sprays are most effective against the crawler stage of scale insects. Repeated applications, usually at 7- to 10-day intervals, will give coverage through an egg-hatch cycle. Insecticides labelled for scale insects included acephate (Orthene), dimethoate (Cygon), carbaryl (Sevin), diazinon and malathion.<p>

<b>Needle Miners and Gall Formers</b>   Active control of these pests is not recommended under most circumstances. Tree damage can be unsightly, but serious injury rarely occurs. Insecticides with some systemic activity are most useful, if needed. Acephate is recommended for needle miners. It is also effective against pinyon spindle gall midge, but labeling is limited for this purpose. Carbaryl can be used against Cooley spruce gall adelgid in spring when buds are expanding.
Once galls begin, their formation is irreversible. Light infestations can be hand pruned as galls form. Restricted-use, soil-applied systemic insecticides are effective in reducing spruce galls, but because of high toxicity, these chemicals can only be applied by a licensed applicator. Blue spruce and Douglas fir should not be planted together because the Cooley spruce gall adelgid needs both tree species to complete its life cycle.<p>

<b>Caterpillar and Sawfly</b>   Carbaryl and acephate will take care of most caterpillar and sawfly problems. Bacillus thuringiensis (Dipel or Thuricide) is a microbial insecticide that is safe for the environment and effective on most caterpillars, if applied properly. Insecticidal soaps are effective on sawfly larvae, if applied soon after egg hatch.<p>

<b>Conifer Apbids</b>   It usually isn't necessary to control aphids on conifers. If control is desired, trees can be sprayed with a dormant oil before buds break (see scales). Insecticidal soap, acephate, diazinon, dimethoate, endosulfan and malathion give adequate control of aphids. Washing trees with a strong stream of water also helps reduce these pests.<p>

<b>Spider Mites</b>   Miticides such as Kelthane and Pentac will control spider mites. Other insecticides with some mite activity include acephate, malathion and diazinon. Inseticidal soaps can be effective early in the season, before populations are high. Washing trees, especially spruce, periodically with a strong stream of water will keep spider mite populations at low levels.<p>

<b>Pine Tip Moths</b>   Chemical sprays for pine tip moths need to cover the branch terminal ends at the time of egg laying and egg hatching. Pheromone traps are available to determine the peak mating and egg-laying periods for most species. Insecticides that will control pine tip moth include acephate, dimethoate, Bacillus thuringiensis, carbaryl and diazinon. The Nantucket pine tip moth has multiple generations, which may require two to four spray treatments over the growing season.<p>

You can enjoy the look of spring during winter by forcing bulbs to flower. Bulbs can be forced to bloom before their normal season by providing them a period of cold temperatures followed by a period of warm temperatures. <P>

Tulips, hyacinths, daffodils, crocus, dutch iris, and other hardy bulbs1 can be easily forced. Select bulbs that are heavy and blemish-free; large bulbs are easier to force and produce larger blooms than small bulbs. For best results, select bulbs that were produced for forcing purposes. Number one bulbs are usually the best quality and are recommended for forcing.<P>


<H2>COLD TREATMENT</H2>

Florist suppliers often have precooled hyacinth and crocus bulbs, which are ready for forcing. However, if the bulbs have not had a cold treatment, place them in pots and store them for 8-12 weeks in a cold frame, cool cellar, outdoor shed, garage, or other dark area with temperatures from 35-45 degrees F. Do not expose bulbs to freezing temperatures.<P>

Use clay or plastic pots that are wide at the top and somewhat more shallow than standard pots. For growing bulbs in containers, use a growing medium that is light, well-drained, and well-aerated. Equal parts of sphagnum peat moss, vermiculite, and perlite make a good medium. Fertilizer is not necessary during cold treatment because the bulb contains its own food supply.<P>

Do not crowd bulbs in the pot; leave about 1/2" between bulbs. Place bulbs with their tips level with the soil surface. Leave about 1" between the soil and the rim of the pot for watering. Water the potted bulbs generously before placing them in storage.<P>

Label the pots clearly. Schedule removal from storage so you will have a succession of blooms throughout the winter.<P>

A bulb's root system will develop during the cold storage period. In fact, one sure sign that pots have had sufficient cold treatment is that a good root mass has formed in the pot, as indicated by the ease with which the plant can be removed from the pot. Also, some roots may be growing through the drainage hole and top growth may be visible.<P>

<H2>WARM TREATMENTS</H2>

When potted bulbs are ready to be brought indoors, provide the bulbs with a one-week period of cool temperatures (40-50 degrees F) and low light conditions. Then bring the pots indoors and place them where they will receive adequate sunlight and where night temperatures are no lower than 60 degrees F. Pots must be well watered at all times; keep them moist, but not wet.<P>

<H2>CARING FOR BULBS AFTER BLOOMING</H2>

When blooms wither, gradually reduce watering, but give enough water to keep the foliage green. Apply a water-soluble fertilizer to replenish the bulb's food supply. The size of next season's blooms will depend on the bulb's growth during this period.<P>

Forced bulbs may not flower the following season. However, they will bloom in future years if their foliage is allowed to mature naturally by planting the bulbs outside as soon as the danger of freezing has passed.<P>

<h1>Planting Spring-Flowering Bulbs Outdoors</h1>
<h2>Guide H-413</h2>
<h3>Lynn Ellen Doxon, Extension Horticulturist</h3>

Spring-flowering bulbs add bright colors to home landscapes earlier than annual flowers and earlier than most perennial flowers. Most will bloom and multiply for years without a great deal of care. They can be planted in beds within gardens or lawns, used as border plants, planted around trees, or grown in pots or window boxes.<p>

Buy spring-flowering bulbs as soon as they appear in the store. Most do best when planted in September and October; however, they can be planted later if the soil temperature is not below freezing. Planting in early fall encourages early root growth and earlier spring flowering.<p>
<p>
Bulbs last longer in a sunny place, although they also do well under trees that lose their leaves in winter. At lower elevations in New Mexico, plant bulbs in cooler areas, such as the north or east side of the house. They grow best in porous soil that drains well, and that has good water- and nutrient-holding capacities. Loam or sandy loam soils are ideal. Heavy loam or clay soil needs an organic soil amendment such as peat moss, ground bark, or aged sawdust.<p>

Planting depth for bulbs should be about three times their height -- a little deeper in sandy soils and not quite as deep in heavy soils. Soil at the bottom of the hole should be level and loose so the bulb base can be placed firmly but gently in contact with the soil. Fertilizer should be mixed with the soil in the bottom of the hole, and covered with an inch of compost or soil before the bulb is deposited. Avoid fertilizers with a high nitrogen ratio. Fertilizers with a high ratio of phosphorus or potassium are usually best.<p>

Bulbs can be thought of as pre-packaged plants, with embryo flowers, leaves and roots all inside. Stems, leaves and flowers will grow out of the top of the bulb during late winter and early spring. After flowering and while the leaves are green, foods are produced in the foliage and stored in the bulbs for next spring's growth of flower, leaf, root and stem. The parts above ground usually grow for 2 or 3 months, and should not be removed until they have turned brown. When the leaves and roots die, the bulb becomes dormant until fall when root growth starts again.<p>

The bulb's roots should get enough nutrients to make sure the foliage produces the most food possible during its short season. During the second year, solid or water-soluble fertilizers can be applied as soon as the soil warms up in spring. When solid fertilizer is used, enough water should be applied to make sure it reaches the bulb's root system. Water-soluble fertilizers can be applied every 2 or 3 weeks. Organic fertilizers such as dried blood, composted manures or sludge must be applied during fall so they will break down in time to release their nutrients by early spring.<p>

Bulbs need plenty of moisture when they are actively growing. Remember, roots are quite deep in the ground and need more than light, surface watering One good soaking is usually enough until the leaves appear. Continue watering after the bulbs finish blooming, keeping the soil moist, not wet, until the leaves turn yellow naturally.<p>

Bulbs will multiply each year by producing new bulbs at the base of the mature bulb. For the first 2 or 3 years, this increases the number of flowers appearing in each location. After that, bulbs start to get overcrowded and produce fewer, smaller flowers. When this happens, the bulbs should be dug and divided. Dig the bulbs just before the leaves fade in late spring. Separate the clumps of bulbs and replant the largest, healthiest bulbs. If replanted in the same location, work a little extra fertilizer into the soil in the bottom of the hole. Extra bulbs can be planted in another location or shared with others.<p>

<h1>Establishing Fruit and Shade Trees</H1>
<H2>Guide H-420</H2>
<H3>Darrell T. Sullivan, Professor, Horticulture Department<BR>
Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</H3>


Getting off to a good start is essential to growing a healthy long-lived tree. A stunted tree seldom develops into a desirable one. Weak growth and poor foliage let the sun burn the trunk and branches, making the tree more susceptible to attacks by insects and diseases. Success in establishing trees is improved when good cultural practices are followed.<P>

<I>Preplanting care.</I> Keep the tree in a cool place and the roots moist until planted. Bare roots may be soaked in a bucket of water for a few hours or overnight, but no longer.<P>

<I>Digging a hole.</I> Make the circumference and depth large enough to accommodate most of the roots.<P>

<I>Pruning.</I> Remove broken roots of deciduous trees and shorten all others so that they do not touch the sides of the hole. The roots of containerized trees should be pruned by cutting vertically up the sides of the root ball to sever tangled roots.<P>

Prune one-third to one-half of the tops of bare-rooted trees. This may be done by shortening the main leader, removing some side branches, and shortening the others. This practice reduces the amount of foliage the root system has to support as it begins to grow.<P>

<I>Plant the tree no deeper than it grew in the nursery. </I>Fill around the roots with well pulverized soil, tamping to prevent air pockets. Water to settle the soil, then add more soil and more water. In sandy soils peat is often added. Make sure it is moist and mixed well with the soil before filling the hole.<P>

<I>Add no manure or fertilizer in the planting hole. </I>The development of new roots is dependent primarily upon moisture, and contact with high fertilizer concentrations may cause injury resulting in burning around the edges of leaves (salt burn).<P>

<I>Water.</I> If the tree is planted in late winter or early spring, water often enough to keep the soil moist. After growth starts, more frequent irrigations will be needed. usually every 7 to 14 days during the first growing season. Container trees that are growing when planted may need m ore frequent irrigations until the roots have grown out of the soil ball.<P>

The second season, after the tree becomes established, irrigations may be less frequent. However, more water is needed as the tree grows. The small basin originally left for watering will no longer be sufficient. Enlarge the basin and water thoroughly, well past the drip line of the tree. Frequent light applications of water promote shallow root systems.<P>

<I>Fertilizers.</I> No fertilizer should be needed the first season. In sandy soil a very small amount may be beneficial if applied once or twice During the season and followed with plenty of water. Never apply fertilizer to a dry soil. Irrigate and wait until the next regular irrigation before applying. As the tree grows older, apply more fertilizer.<P>

Usually nitrogen is the main element needed. A general rule is to annually apply 3/4 pound of ammonium sulfate or the equivalent amount of other nitrogenous fertilizers for each year of age or inch of trunk diameter. Apply uniformly on the soil starting 1 8 inches from the trunk and going well past the drip line. Split applications are less likely to damage the roots, especially in heavy soils, and less nitrogen is lost through leaching in sandy soils. Divide the total annual amount by two or three and apply at monthly intervals. Apply no fertilizer after June 30.<P>

<I>Young trees in lawns.</I> Trees planted in established lawns require special attention. Young trees do not compete well with grass for water and mineral nutrients. Also, lawns are usually irrigated frequently but lightly so that water does not reach the bulk of the tree's root system. Keep grass from around a tree out to the drip line. If grass is not removed extra water and fertilizer will be needed. After the tree is older it competes much better.<P>

<I>Winter sun scald.</I> Summer sun may burn the hark of weak trees. However, winter sun is equally as injurious even to healthy ones. During warm winter days the sun warms the exposed bark of the trunk and main branches on the southwest side. At night, temperatures may rapidly fall below freezing. This alternate cooling and warming injures the bark tissues. The tree weakens and becomes vulnerable to insects and diseases.<P>

Paint trunks of young trees with exterior white latex paint (not oil base) to reflect the winter sun. Maintain temporary branches on the lower part of the trunk to shade the southwest side. Remove temporary branches when higher main branches extend far enough to shade the trunk in winter.<P>

<TITLE>Watering Your Lawn</title>

<h1>Watering Your Lawn</h1>
<h2>Guide H-504</h2>
<h3>Lynn Ellen Doxon, Extension Horticulture Specialist</h3>
Proper watering is important to maintain an attractive, healthy lawn; however water is a limited resource in New Mexico. Efficient water use on home lawns makes a significant contribution to water conservation. Use these guidelines to water your lawn efficiently.<p>

<li>Soak the soil in the root zone<p>
<li>Do not let thatch build up<p>
<li>Water only when necessary<p>
<li>Check sprinklers for uniform application<p>
<li>Test water quality<p>

<h3>SOAK THE SOIL IN THE ROOT ZONE</h3>
Each watering should moisten the soil to a depth of 6-8 in. on bluegrass and 8-12 in. on other grasses. This is the grass's active root zone. The length of time and amount of water it will take to moisten the root zone depend on soil type and the irrigation system. Water will penetrate sandy soils more quickly and more deeply than clay soils. <p>
To determine the length of time required to moisten your lawn's root zone:<p>
<ol>
<li>Run the sprinklers for 15 minutes. <p>
<li>Twenty-four hours later, dig a small hole in the ground or use a probe to determine how deeply the soil is moistened. You will use this information to determine how long to water each time. <p>
<li>To calculate the number of minutes to water the lawn divide 120 by the depth of the moistened soil in inches. For example, if the water soaked in 4 in., figure 120/4 = 30 minutes. It would take an hour to soak in eight inches. If it soaked in 6 in., the lawn should be watered for 20 minutes (120/6 in. = 20 minutes). <p>
However, bluegrass has a shallower root system than other grasses; it needs to be soaked to a depth of only 6-8 in. (instead of 8-12 in). Take the second example above: In 15 minutes, water soaked in 6 in. You would need to water a bluegrass lawn for only 15 minutes instead of the 20 minutes calculated for other types of grass.<p>
</ol>
Once the length of the watering period is established, use the same period each time you water, no matter what the season. <p>
If water starts to run off the lawn before the end of the watering period, turn the water off for one hour and let the water soak in; then turn the sprinklers back on and finish watering. <p>
<h3>DO NOT LET THATCH BUILD UP</h3>
Runoff is sometimes caused by excess thatch. If thatch is more than 1/2 in. thick, the lawn should be dethatched. Dethatch cool-season lawns (bluegrass or fescue) in early spring or late summer. Dethatch bermudagrass lawns in late spring. Proper mowing, watering and fertilization can reduce the buildup of thatch. To reduce thatch buildup, avoid overwatering the lawn.<p>
<h3>HOW OFTEN TO WATER</h3>
How often you water will change with the seasons and soil type. First determine how much water is applied during your watering period. Set straight-sided containers like cans around the lawn and turn on the sprinklers for your usual watering period. At the end of the watering period, measure the amount of water in each of the cans. (If the depths vary widely, the sprinkler system needs adjustment. Adjust or replace the sprinkler heads as described below to get more uniform application, then do the can test again). Use the average amount of water in the cans to determine watering frequency.<p>
In the hottest part of the summer, bluegrass will use 1/4-1/3 in. of water per day. Bermuda grass can be maintained on 1/5-1/6 in. although it will use more if more is applied. If your watering period is 30 minutes on a bluegrass lawn and you apply 1 in. each time, you need to water once every 3 days in the hottest part of the summer. If you are applying more water during each watering, water less often. If you are watering your lawn more than three times per week consider soil modification, a different grass species, or a change in management practices. In spring and fall, water less frequently but for the same period of time. <p>
Avoid frequent, shallow watering. It encourages a shallow root system, which makes the lawn more susceptible to drought and grub damage. Watering too deeply should also be avoided. Water that percolates below the root zone is wasted. Water is a scarce and valuable commodity in the West and should be used carefully. <p>
<h3>WATER ONLY WHEN NECESSARY</h3>
When the lawn needs water the grass will take on a bluish or dull green color and the blades will begin to fold or roll. Footprints will remain visible after the lawn is walked on. <p>
Tree and shrub roots competing with the turf will require additional water. Once a month soak the soil very deep to encourage tree and shrub root development below the turf root zone. Leave the sprinklers on three times the normal time or use a soaker hose under the entire tree canopy.<p>
The best time of day to water is in the early morning.  Less water evaporates if lawns are watered when temperatures are cool and winds are calm. These conditions occur most frequently in early morning. Late afternoon and evening watering also reduces evaporation losses if winds are calm, but tends to encourage disease because the grass stays moist all night. Many of the fungus diseases that affect grass require water droplets or high humidity to sporulate and infect the plants. Midday watering is more convenient for many people and does not harm the lawn. However, more water is lost to evaporation.<p>
In most situations sprinklers are the most effective way to water lawns. Flood irrigation can also be used on level lawns where a water source is available. Sprinkler spray patterns should overlap 80-100% depending on the type of sprinkler system that is installed. Follow the manufacturer's directions for proper sprinkler installation. A good system must provide even water distribution to all grassed areas. The water must be applied to only the grassed areas, not to walls, sidewalks, driveways or streets. Use the can test described above to gauge uniformity. Most sprinkler heads have a spring adjustment to control the flow of water. Sprinklers that water less than a full circle can be adjusted to direct water away from walls and paved areas. If some sprinkler heads have been replaced, it may be necessary to replace all of the sprinkler heads in order to achieve uniform application.<p>
<h3>TEST WATER QUALITY</h3>
If the irrigation water is not supplied by a municipal water system, have the water quality tested before using it for irrigation. The test will determine if the water quality is good, borderline or too poor to use. If the water quality is borderline high in soluble salts, pH, magnesium, calcium or sodium you may need to use more water and leach some of the excess salts or minerals below the root zone. There is no need to apply extra water unless the water you are using is of borderline quality. <p>

<h1>MOWING YOUR LAWN</h1>
<h2>Guide H-505</h2>
<h3>Lynn Ellen Doxon, Extension Horticulture Specialist</h3> 

Proper mowing is important to maintain an attractive lawn. The health of a lawn and its ability to resist drought, weed infestation, and other stresses are affected by how you mow. There is more to proper mowing than just cutting the grass. You need to know:<p>
  <li>How high to mow the grass<p>
  <li>How often to mow<p>
  <li>When to mow<p>
  <li>What to do with the clippings<p>
  <li>What mowing patterns to use<p>
  <li>How to use a mower safely <p>

<h3>HOW HIGH TO MOW THE GRASS</h3>

Mowing height depends mainly on the type of grass and the time of year. Various kinds of grass have individual growing habits that need different mowing heights. Be sure your mower is set for the type of grass you are mowing (table 1).<p>

<b>Table 1. Recommended mowing height.</b>
________________________________________________________________________________
<pre>			   Recommended Mowing Height (in.)
Grass			Spring		Summer		Fall
_________________________________________________________________________________
Bermudagrass 		1-1.5 		1-1.5		1-1.5
Bluegrass 		2 		3 		2
Buffalograss 		1.5-2 		1.5-2 		1.5-2
Ryegrass 		2 		3 		2
Tall Fescue 		2.5 		3.5 		2.5
Zoysia 			1-1.5 		1-1.5 		1-1.5
_________________________________________________________________________________

</pre>
<h4>Cool-season grasses</h4>

Cool-season grasses (bluegrass, ryegrass, and fescue) are mowed higher than warm-season grasses because of their erect growth habit. They should be cut higher in the summer than in the spring or fall because hot weather stresses cool-season grasses. Leaving additional foliage on the plant helps insulate the ground against the heat, furnishes more food-producing area, and maintains deeper roots during hot weather. However, do not mow too tall or the grass will become coarse, stemmy, and matted.<p>
Mowing cool-season grasses too short during hot weather stresses the turf and it will need excessive watering. Short, infrequent mowing causes thin, weak turf that is eventually taken over by weeds. Avoid sudden drastic lowering of the cutting height since this seriously curtails root growth. <p>
<h4>Warm-season grasses</h4>
The mowing heights of warm-season grasses (bermuda, buffalograss, and zoysia) are shorter than for cool season grasses because their leaves are produced on runners (stolons) that grow close to the ground. Warm-season grasses grow best during the summer so there is no need to raise the summer mowing height to protect them from heat stress.<p>
Bermudagrass and zoysia build up excessive thatch quickly when mowed higher than recommended. Grasses lose their drought resistance when a thick (more than 1/2 in.) layer of thatch builds up. <p>
<h3>KEEP THE BLADE SHARP</h3>
The key to a quality mowing job is a sharp blade. Dull blades beat and tear the grass leaving frayed edges that give a whitish cast to the lawn. Sharp blades improve the energy efficiency of mowing by cutting cleaner and quicker with less power. Sharp blades are especially important for zoysia, ryegrass, and tall fescue.<p>
Inspect the blade after each mowing for nicks and dullness. The amount of mowing, kind of grass, and debris struck determine how often the blade must be sharpened. It is a good idea to have an extra sharp blade on hand.<p>
<h3>HOW OFTEN TO MOW</h3>
Mowing height and mowing frequency are the two most important aspects of mowing, and also are most often done incorrectly. They are closely related and are of equal importance. It takes frequent, consistent mowing to produce a high-quality, attractive lawn. It is best not to remove <i>more than 1/3 of the total leaf surface at any one mowing</i>.  Don't wait too long before mowing--cutting off most of the leaf tissue is a severe shock to the grass. It causes stubble and thinning out, curtails root growth, and requires unnecessary watering for the grass to recover. In summer removing too much leaf area often results in sun scalding (turning white) on the lower leaves and stems. Also, mowing grass that has grown too tall is hard on the mower, takes longer, and produces lots of "hay" that must be removed. <p>
Base your mowing frequency on the growth rate of the grass rather than any set time schedule. Your lawn may require mowing once a week in the spring, every two weeks in the summer, and twice a week in the fall for a cool-season grass. Weather conditions determine the growth rate of the grass, but watering and fertilizing also affect the rate. <p>
The shorter a lawn is mowed, the more often it must be mowed to avoid taking off more than 1/3 of the blade. Use the following table as a guide for when to mow and how much to remove.<p>

	4 			6 		    2

<h3>WHEN TO MOW</h3>
It is best to mow when the grass is dry, but during rainy periods it is better to mow the grass wet than to let it get too tall. Dry grass is easier to mow and doesn't stick to the mower as badly. Wet clippings stain buildings and clothing, and clump together on the lawn.<p>
Newly planted bluegrass, fescue, and ryegrass should be mowed to 2 in. as soon as it grows 3 in. tall. It does not hurt new grass to mow it. In fact, it is harmful to let new grass get too tall and then cut it back. This is a shock to the grass and results in coarse stubble.<p>
New zoysia, bermudagrass, and buffalograss should be mowed at 1-1 1/2 inches as soon as there is anything to mow. This forces the grass to spread. New grass is quite succulent and tends to stick to the mower the first few mowings; mow it on a warm, dry afternoon or evening. Avoid watering the day before mowing. Mow frequently to encourage the grass to spread and thicken.<p>
<h3>WHAT TO DO WITH CLIPPINGS</h3>
Whether or not to remove clippings after mowing largely dependents on mowing frequency. If the lawn is mowed often enough (table 2) clippings will filter down into the grass and <i>do not have to be removed</i>. However, long clippings that remain on top of the grass should be removed. Excess clippings exclude sunlight and promote disease if they are wet. Never let the grass get so long that clippings stay on top.<p>
Clippings contribute little to permanent thatch because they contain mostly water and soft tissue that decomposes readily. Clippings return about 25% of the fertilizer when they fall on the soil and are a source of organic matter.<p>
<h3>WHAT MOWING PATTERN TO USE</h3>
It is a good idea to mow from a different angle each time the lawn is mowed. Soil compaction and turf wear from the mower wheels will be distributed over the lawn  more uniformly.<p>
Grass blades tend to lean in the direction of mowing. This pattern can be minimized by mowing in different directions. <p>
When mowing without a catcher, make a few rounds throwing grass away from buildings, sidewalks, and driveways. After these rounds throw the clippings away from uncut grass. Repeatedly throwing clippings on uncut grass is hard on the mower, wastes energy, and results in a poor cutting job. <p>
Establish several mowing patterns that result in as few turns as possible. This not only reduces mowing time but also reduces damage to the turf by mower wheels when turning.<p>
<h4>Caring for trees in your lawn</h4>
Bumping young and thin-barked trees with a lawnmower causes serious injury reducing growth and vigor of the tree. What seems like a minor bruise later enlarges into a deep wound that destroys the cambium (growth) tissue just under the bark. Repeated bumping each time the lawn is mowed may result in the eventual death of the tree. <p>
Nylon cord trimmers also injure young and thin barked trees. It is better to do some hand trimming than to injure or kill the trees. Also, maintain a cultivated or mulched area 1-1 1/2 feet wide around tree trunks.<p>

<h3>HOW TO USE A LAWN MOWER SAFELY</h3>
Power mowers can be dangerous and cause serious injury. Become familiar with your equipment, use good judgment, and be safety minded.<p>

  <li>Read the operator's manual for safety instructions.<p>
  <li>Pick up debris before each mowing.<p>
  <li>Keep children and pets a safe distance from mower.<p>
  <li>Keep feet and hands away from blades when starting and running engine.<p>
  <li>Wear sturdy shoes and long pants.<p>
  <li>Operate mower at a slow speed.<p>
  <li>Always push mower rather than pull it toward you.<p>
  <li>Watch your footing on slopes and wet grass.<p>
  <li>Don't leave the engine running unattended.<p>
  <li>Refuel the engine only when it is shut off and cool.<p>
  <li>Wear goggles when operating cord trimmers and power edgers.<p>
  <li>Stop engine and disconnect spark plug wire before working on engine or blade.<p>
  <li>Keep mower in good repair and adjustment.<p>

<h1>Bermudagrass Spring Seeding</h1>
<h2>Guide H-506</h2>
<h3>Arden Baltensperger, Emeritus Professor of Agronomy<br>
Lynn Ellen Doxon, Extension Horticulture Specialist</h3>

<h3>ESTABLISHING BERMUDAGRASS IN NEW OR COMPLETELY RENOVATED AREAS</h3>
Seeding one of the new improved bermudagrass varieties is a relatively inexpensive and effective way to establish a turf area. For best results:<p>
  <li>Choose one of the new improved seed propagated bermudagrass varieties. High-quality Certified Seed is available and recommended.<p>
<li>Seed only when soil temperatures are 60 degrees F or above. Optimum soil temperatures for bermudagrass growth and development is 75 - 80 degrees F. Do not seed bermudagrass in cold soil. <p>
<li>Prepare a good seed bed. Plant the seed at a depth of 1/4 inch or less and firm the area with a roller or packer after planting.<p>
<li>Seeding rates should take seed processing into account. Suggested planting rates, under good seeding conditions, with high germination (85% or above) and high purity (98% or above) are:<p>
<pre>	Hulled -- 1.0-1.5 lb per 1000 ft squared
	Unhulled -- 1.5-2.0 lb per 1000 ft squared
	Hulled-Coated -- 1.5-2.0 lb per 1000 ft squared</pre>

Specific information is not available for unhulled/coated seed, however, more than 1.5-2.0 lb per 1000 ft squared of this type of seed   nd satisfactory establishment of this type of seed.<p>
<li>Keep the planted area moist for approximately 7 days, when most varieties will have germinated. Reduce watering after the plants are established.<p>
<li>After establishment, use chemicals only when definitely needed. The new bermudagrass varieties are tough and environmentally friendly.<p>
If good cultural management and one of the new improved varieties are used in an area of adaptation, the resulting turfgrass should prove satisfactory.<p>
<h3>REPAIRING DAMAGED TURF</h3>
Moderate or severe damage to bermudagrass turf may result from plant stress due to:<p>
  <li>Excess traffic.
  <li>Desiccation, especially during winter months.
  <li>Winter killing that is primarily a result of low temperature.
  <li>Pests (animals, disease, and insects).
  <li>Overall cultural mismanagement.<p>
Bermudagrass turf on sports fields, parks, fairways, and home lawns is often damaged during winter dormancy as well as during the growing season. With the new seed-propagated varieties of bermudagrass and good cultural practices, repairing damaged turfgrass areas is relatively quick, inexpensive, and satisfactory. This repair is best when done in spring and early summer. In areas with very mild winter climates, the repair period may be extended throughout the summer. <p>
Start by preparing a seedbed in the damaged area with a vertical mower. For moderately damaged areas, this may be all the seedbed preparation needed. However, if an area is severely compacted, a more complete renovation and seedbed preparation will be needed. Consider purchasing one of the new slit seeders if annual damage repair is planned for high-traffic turf areas. A slit seeder speeds the process and encourages a higher germination rate.<p>
Seed the area with a light seeding rate of 1/2- (moderately damaged)-1 lb (severely damaged) of hulled seed per 1,000 ft squared.  A heavier rate of seeding is needed if unhulled or coated seed is used.  <p>
<h3>SEED AND SEEDING</h3>
Four different forms of bermudagrass seed are now commercially available. They are:<p>
<b>Unhulled</b><br>
This is cleaned, field-harvested seed with the glume (floral bract.) attached. There are approximately 1.6 million seeds per lb of unhulled seed.<p>
<b>Hulled</b><br>
The glumes have been removed mechanically and this seed has approximately 30% more seeds per pound  than unhulled seed.(Hulled seed germination is generally 1-3 days faster than for unhulled seed.. There are approximately 2.1 million seeds per lb of hulled seed.<p>
<b>Hulled-Coated</b><br>
This form, if coated with a lime-based fertilizer coating, may have 50% fewer seeds per lb than raw hulled seed or only about 1 million seeds per lb. Adequate soil moisture is more critical for this type during germination than for uncoated seed.<p>
<b>Unhulled-Coated</b><br>
This seed with the glumes intact is coated with lime-based fertilizer or other material. There are fewer than one million seeds per lb. There is little information available on seeding rates for unhulled, coated seed as it is not generally used.<p>
<h3>SELECTING A VARIETY</h3>
"NuMex SAHARA" has performed well in the bermudagrass belt or areas with a similar climate. It is somewhat denser and is a shorter growing variety than the variety "common." It has a medium-fine texture and good summer green color. "NuMex SAHARA" also has excellent drought resistance and moderate bermuda stunt mite resistance. It has similar or moderately more cold tolerance than "common." If irrigation water is limited, consider planting "NuMex SAHARA"; in experiments in Texas, it ranked very high in drought resistance when compared with 27 other seed- and vegetatively propagated varieties.<p>

<h1>Lawn Care for Disease Control</h1>
<h2>Guide H-507</h2>
<h3>Natalie P. Goldberg, Extension Plant Pathologist</h3>

For many, the ideal landscape around homes and businesses includes an area of turfgrass. The lush greenery not only beautifies our landscapes, but also provides favorable environmental influences such as cooler temperatures, higher humidity, and reduced dust. Unfortunately, the desire to have an aesthetically pleasing lawn and actually having one are often two different things.<p>
Turfgrass is susceptible to many different types of diseases. Once established in a turfgrass planting, these diseases can be devastating. Thus, maintaining healthy, attractive lawns takes hard work and management practices that reduce the likelihood of disease.<p>
Managing lawns begins before the grass is planted. Selecting the turfgrass variety, evaluating the planting site, preparing the site, and installing the turf are all important components in building a healthy lawn. Once established, how that lawn is cared for plays an enormous role in the overall health and appearance of the lawn.<p>
<h3>Key Points for Maintaining Healthy Lawns</h3>
<ul>
<li>Select an appropriate turfgrass species for the location. Consider:<br>
	-  climate,<br>
	-  shade (light and air circulation),<br>
	-  soil type and conditions,<br>
	-  terrain,<br>
	-  susceptibility to pests, and<br>
	-  use of the turf area.<p>
<li>Prepare the site before planting:<br>
	-  Remove debris.<br>
	-  Grade the area.<br>
	-  Provide good drainage.<br>
	-  Take a soil test and amend soil as needed.<br>
	-  Eliminate weeds.<p>
<li>Avoid watering late in the day or at night.<p>
<li>Apply enough water in each application to completely wet the root zone.<p>
<li>Apply the appropriate amount of water based on species, soil, and climate.<p>
<li>Provide adequate light penetration and air circulation.<p>
<li>Apply the appropriate amount of fertilizer (based on a soil test).<p>
<li>Mow frequently, maintaining the tallest height recommended for the species.<p>
<li>Be sure to use mowers with sharp blades.<p>
<li>Leave clippings on the lawn surface.<p>
<li>Dethatch by aerating, raking, or vertical mowing as needed.<p></ul>
<h3>Selecting a Turfgrass Species</h3>
In selecting the type of turf, you should consider climate, soil type, use of the turf, maintenance requirements, and susceptibility to various pests.<p>
<h4>Climate</h4>
Grasses are adapted to geographic regions by temperature and rainfall, but light also may be a factor in certain species' adaptability to a given location. Choosing a variety appropriate for the climate is important. Although water can be supplemented through irrigation, it is not possible to alter regional temperatures.<p>
Grasses usually are classified as either cool- or warm-season. Cool-season grasses (such as ryegrass, bluegrass, bentgrass, and fescue) grow best in temperate and subarctic climates when the temperature is between 60 and 77 F degrees. If planted in areas likely to have prolonged periods of high temperatures or drought (as in much of New Mexico), cool-season grasses will require plenty of moisture during times of stress. Thus, these grasses are not selected for low water use plantings. Of the cool-season grasses, tall fescue is the most useful for New Mexico, as it has the highest heat tolerance.<p>
Warm-season grasses (such as bermudagrass, St. Augustine, buffalograss, and blue grama) grow best when temperatures are between 77 and 95 F degrees. These grasses are used extensively in warm-climate regions and are particularly useful for low water use plantings. These grasses are dormant during the winter. St. Augustine is the least winter-hardy of the warm-season grasses, which limits its use in New Mexico to the most southern portions of the state.<p>
Light intensity and shading also should be considered in selecting grass species. Low light or heavily shaded turf will generally grow slowly, creating succulent leaf blades that are more susceptible to disease. Shaded turf areas also may suffer from increased competition for water and nutrients from other plants, increased humidity, decreased air circulation, and greater temperature fluctuations. All these situations tend to favor the development of many turfgrass diseases.<p>
<h4>Soil Type and Conditions</h4>
Soil type refers to the texture and structure (aeration) properties of a soil. These properties are difficult to alter to any great extent and should therefore be considered when choosing grass species and sites. Other soil conditions, such as acidity or alkalinity and fertility, can be modified more easily.<p>
Species vary in their adaptability to different soils. In general, fertile, permeable soils that have good water holding capacity with relatively rapid subsoil drainage are best suited for most turfgrass species. High quality turf also can be maintained on less-than-ideal soils as long as it is provided with excellent care.<p>
<h4>Use of the Turf</h4>
The use of the turf is important, as different species vary in their tolerance of traffic. Additionally, some species are better for erosion control, slopes, and roadsides. Home lawns or turf used for aesthetic purposes around buildings, cemeteries, and parks should be of fine texture. Kentucky bluegrass and fine fescue are two of the more common choices for these areas. Coarse-textured grasses tend to hold up better under heavy traffic, as on athletic fields, school yards, and golf fairways. Bermudagrass, tall fescue, perennial ryegrass, and zoysia are often selected for these areas.<p>
The growth habit of the turf species also may be considered in selecting grass for particular uses. For example, bermudagrass should be avoided in areas where distinct grass areas are to be kept separate from other garden areas, or in cemeteries, where the invasive, creeping growth habit is difficult to control and manicure around headstones. Buffalograss and blue grama are popular choices where low water use and low maintenance are the primary selection criteria.<p>
<h4>Maintenance</h4>
Some grasses require intensive management in order to maintain their appearance and health. Others are more tolerant of some neglect. However, no grass can tolerant extensive neglect or poor treatment. Most species used as home lawns require a moderate amount of care to maintain appearance.<p>
<h4>Susceptibility to Pests</h4>
Grasses vary in their susceptibility to insects, weeds, and diseases. It is a good idea to determine the most prevalent pests in your area and then try to select cultivars tolerant to these pests. This is not always an easy task, but if you make an effort to select tolerant varieties, you will have greater success in maintaining a healthy lawn.<p>
<h3>Selecting the Planting Site</h3>
Planting site selection ties into selection of turfgrass species. If you have a sloping area, then you would select a species that requires little irrigation or mowing and has good erosion control properties. Keep in mind that planting turf on slopes is prohibited in some areas of New Mexico, for instance in Albuquerque. If you have a choice of locations, it is best to choose a flat area with good subsurface drainage. You also want to consider the trees, shrubs, and tall buildings in the area. These features may shade the turf area and decrease air circulation, both of which affect growth and susceptibility to disease.<p>
<h3>Preparing the Site </h3>
Preparing the site before planting can go a long way in establishing a healthy lawn. Consideration should be given to grading and providing drainage, improving the soil, controlling weeds, adjusting pH, and adding fertilizer.<p>
<h4>Grading and Drainage</h4>
Drainage is one of the most important characteristics of lawns in terms of disease prevention. Turf that remains wet for too long or accumulates free-standing water will be predisposed to many disease organisms. Good surface drainage can be provided by grading the lawn area such that there is a slight slope. It is best to slope the lawn away from buildings and sidewalks. Additionally, the area should be devoid of high peaks, which may dry out too quickly or be subjected to scalping injury when mowing. Remove low spots where water tends to collect. Extreme slopes make maintaining good quality turf difficult. If the selected area is a natural steep slope, consider putting in block or rock retaining walls to break up the area and reduce the angle of the slope. You also might consider using ornamental ground covers instead of turf in areas with a steep slope. A 1-2% slope (6-12" per 50 linear feet) is recommended for good surface drainage. Slopes greater than 3-4% should be avoided.<p>
Subsurface drainage is equally important. However, many people ignore this when constructing a lawn. To check the site's drainage, wet the area with 2-4" of water. After the water has moved into the soil, apply another 2-4" of water. If the water pools on the surface and penetrates the soil slowly, the subsurface drainage is probably poor. If the natural subsurface drainage is inadequate, then a system of tile drains are required. Drain tile installed at about 20-ft intervals, 3-4 ft below the surface will provide good subsurface drainage. The subsurface drainage system should be designed to follow the natural slope of the area. If the area is relatively flat, a herringbone design with a center or main drainage line and lateral lines coming into it at 45 degree angles is the best design. The lateral lines should be approximately 20 ft apart.<p>
<h4>Improving the Soil</h4>
Improving the soil involves several tasks. First, remove all large debris from the site. Break up the soil with a rototiller. This will help to reduce soil compaction, which may have occurred if vehicles have been driven over the site (such as with newly constructed homes and buildings). If the soil is very poor, you may want to consider bringing in topsoil. However, you may find beneficial effects from improving the soil you have. Soil that is too heavy, too sticky, or too light (sandy) should be improved before seeding or sodding the area. These soil conditions can be improved by adding organic matter to heavy soils, or adding organic matter and loam clay to light soils. Incorporate these soil-improving amendments into the existing soil by rototilling.<p>
<h4>Controlling Weeds</h4>
Many weed problems can be reduced or eliminated if the area is treated prior to planting. Chemical herbicides provide the most effective control. It is important to use a product that does the job and decomposes quickly without leaving residues in the soil. To select the most appropriate herbicide, you will have to identify the weeds you want to eliminate, because there are several different types of herbicides and many products are available. Additionally, new and improved products are developed each year. Check with the local extension service, chemical distributor, or landscape consultant for current information on weed control. When using chemicals, be sure to read and follow all label directions carefully.<p>
<h4>pH</h4>
Soil pH is the degree of acidity or alkalinity of the soil. In general, plants grow best at a neutral pH (pH 7.0). Soil amendments can be incorporated into the soil that can raise or lower pH as needed. Much of the soil in New Mexico is on the alkaline side of the scale (high pH), so the pH needs to be lowered. Sulfur is probably the most common amendment for lowering soil pH.<p>
<h4>Fertility</h4>
Soil fertility is the native level of nutrients in the soil. The best way to learn about your soil is to take a soil sample and send it to a testing laboratory for analysis. These services provide important information that can help you determine your soil pH, salinity (salt), and nutrient levels. From this information, you can determine the appropriate amounts of amendments or fertilizers to add to the soil. In most cases, the soil testing lab will include recommendations in their report. Several laboratories offer this service. Check with your local county extension office for a list of soil testing services.<p>
<h3>Installation:<br>
Seed Vs. Sod</h3>
There are three ways to establish a turfgrass area: seed, sod, and plugs. The primary advantage of sodding a turf area is the immediate impact on the area. However, seeding may provide a stronger turf area in the long run, as the roots are immediately incorporated into the soil.<p>
<h4>Seeding</h4>
The first rule of thumb is to purchase high quality seed from a reputable dealer. When selecting seed, consider seed mixes that contain more than one grass species. Mixed variety plantings often will survive best. This is true when one of the species is more tolerant of disease or environmental extremes than another. It is often difficult to find the best combination of environmental and pest tolerance in a single variety.<p>
When establishing a lawn by seed, it is best to plant the seed just prior to the most favorable conditions for the grass to grow. Seed should be broadcast over the entire turf area as uniformly as possible. Once distributed, cover the grass seeds lightly by hand raking or dragging with a brush or mat in two directions. Some of the seed still may be visible after raking. Firm the seeded area with a light, empty roller after raking. Newly emerged seedlings should be kept moist until well established. To avoid saturated soil conditions, which favor "damping-off" diseases, you may need to apply light applications of water several times a day.<p>
The first mowing should be done when the tallest grasses are about 1 to 1-1/2" taller than the normal mowing height. Whenever new growth exceeds one-third above the desired cutting height, the grass should be cut again. For example, if the optimum height is 3", you would mow when the grass is one-third again as tall--when the grass 4" tall. This practice will keep clippings to a minimum so they can be left on the surface of the grass without concern for matting.<p>
<h4>Sodding</h4>
Sod is grass-covered earth tightly knit together by roots, rhizomes, and stolons. Sodding is a fast way to establish a turf area. Sod can be laid any time of the year, provided the ground is not frozen. Sodding is more expensive than seeding. However, in some cases it may be the best and most appropriate way to establish a lawn, for example, on steep slopes where irrigation has a tendency to wash seed to the bottom, or in high traffic areas.<p>
If possible, choose sod with a soil similar to that of the planting site. If the soil in the sod roll is different from the planting site, rototilling compost into the planting site will help with sod establishment. Otherwise, the soil is prepared the same as for seeded lawns. Moisten the soil to a depth of 6", but allow for the excess moisture to drain away before laying the sod. Roll the soil to create a smooth, flat surface. Lay the sod side by side as tightly as possible until the entire turf area is covered. To avoid the appearance of lines in the turf, stagger the sod. The newly laid sod should be rolled to set firmly in place. After sodding, keep the grass well watered until the area is established.<p>
<h4>Plugging</h4>
Plugging is the vegetative establishment of lawns by planting small blocks of sod at measured intervals. Plugs vary in size, although plugs 2.5" in diameter and 2-3" deep are often used. A core of soil the same size as the plug should be removed to insure good contact with the soil. The spacing varies depending on the turf species used. The distance is determined by the speed at which the grass grows. In general, plugs are spaced approximately 1 ft apart; however, slow-growing species such as zoysia should be spaced approximately 6" apart. It is essential that plugs are kept moist for two to three weeks after plugging to prevent the roots from drying out.<p>
<h3>Managing Established Turf</h3>
Turfgrass diseases are best controlled with good management practices. These practices include watering, fertilizing, mowing, and aerating.<p>
<h4>Watering</h4>
It is important to provide lawns with adequate moisture. However, there is a fine line between keeping the area too moist and too dry. Extremes in soil moisture lead to disease problems. Drought conditions stress the plants and predispose turfgrass to attack by certain types of fungi, while some fungi thrive in excessive moisture.<p>
Avoid watering in the late afternoon and evening. Many diseases, particularly foliar diseases, require 14 hours of continuous leaf wetness to penetrate the leaf surface. Anything that can minimize the length of time the leaf surface stays wet will help to control these diseases.<p>
Water deeply so that water moves completely through the root zone. This will help to develop a deep root system, which will tolerate temperature and moisture extremes better than a shallow root system. The amount of water needed to maintain healthy turf will vary depending on the type of grass, the condition of the turf, and the time of year. Be guided by the needs of the turf rather than by a set schedule, and you will have better luck keeping your lawn in peak condition.<p>
Light penetration and air circulation are other factors that influence the duration of leaf wetness in turf. It is important to decrease shade and increase air circulation to enhance drying of the grass blades. If heavily shaded turf is desired, then select shade-tolerant cultivars when establishing the lawn. Shade-tolerant turf tends to also be more tolerant of the diseases favored by shaded conditions.<p>
<h4>Fertilizing</h4>
Apply fertilizer at the proper rates and times. All lawns need fertilizer for strong growth. Nutrients also influence disease organisms in the soil. Some diseases prefer nutrient-starved turf, while others like a lot of nitrogen and may be more apt to attack grass immediately following high nitrogen applications.<p>
Fertilizer recommendations vary depending on the growing region. However, a good general recommendation is to apply 50% or more of the total yearly nitrogen in the fall. During this time cool-season grasses produce most of their tillers. Having nitrogen available during tillering helps create a thicker lawn. Additionally, applying fertilizer in the spring is helpful to re-establish turf that has been dormant during the winter. In some cases, it may be useful to apply slow-release nitrogen fertilizers. This will help to provide an even source of the nutrient and avoid the flush of excess nitrogen that triggers so many diseases.<p>
<h4>Mowing</h4>
Mowing is one of the most important cultural management practices in caring for lawns. Turfgrass should be maintained at appropriate heights, which vary depending on grass species. In general, turf should be maintained at the tallest recommended height that still allows for the designated use of the turf. For example, Kentucky bluegrass and tall fescue lawns should be at least 2" tall. If you mow these grasses at less than 2", it puts a lot of stress on them and makes them more susceptible to disease.<p>
Avoid cycles of tall and short grass. This means you will have to mow fairly frequently when the grass is actively growing. Cycling grass between too-tall and too-short conditions interferes with the plants' production of carbohydrates, which serve as an energy source for growth. Without adequate carbohydrates, the plants cannot maintain strong growth.<p>
Maintain mowers in good working condition. Keep the blades sharp. Dull mower blades will leave jagged cuts, which will be more susceptible to diseases than smooth, clean cuts, and will leave a tattered appearance in the lawn.<p>
When grass is mowed properly, the clippings can be left on the surface of the lawn. Clippings do not contribute to thatch build-up or influence disease in this situation. However, if the grass has grown too tall before cutting, the clippings will need to be removed, adding unnecessary biomass to our landfills. If too many clippings are left on the lawn surface, they block light from the plants and cause matting. The grass beneath the clippings will die as if you had placed a solid object on it.<p>
<h4>Aerating</h4>
Aeration is the soil's capacity for air penetration. It also influences surface drainage. Penetration of air and water into the soil is directly influenced by the thatch layer. Thatch is a mixture of living and dead roots, rhizomes, and stolons that develops between the layer of green vegetation and the soil surface.<p>
A little thatch is good because it reduces water loss due to evaporation, reduces temperature fluctuations, and creates a cushion in turf used for athletic events. However, when the thatch layer becomes greater than 2 cm thick (about 3/4"), it can start to interfere with the movement of air and water into the soil. In addition, when the thatch layer is thick, the roots will tend to grow into the thatch instead of into the soil. Roots in the thatch layer are more susceptible to drought and high-temperature stress. These roots also are impaired in their ability to take up nutrients from the soil. Additionally, thatch harbors many plant pathogens, which use thatch as a nutrient source.<p>
There are several ways to combat the problem of excessive thatch, including aeration, thinning, raking, and vertical mowing. Aerating, also called <i>coring</i> or <i>hole punching</i>, is making holes or slits in turf for the purpose of improving the drainage and air exchange. Aeration increases beneficial microbial activity in the soil, which aids in decomposing the thatch layer. Lawns exposed to heavy traffic usually require aeration twice a year during the growing season. Spring and fall are the best times for the cool-season grasses, whereas spring and summer are best for warm-season grasses.<p>
Thinning and raking the turf on a regular basis keeps thatch from accumulating, and in some cases, can help to reduce an excessive thatch layer. However, sporadic treatment is not likely to provide much help.<p>
Vertical mowing may be necessary on lawns with a heavy thatch layer. Vertical mowing is cutting with blades or tines that move perpendicular to the soil surface. This activity cuts or slices the turf and acts like a mechanical rake. The result is thinned turf with reduced thatch. Vertical mowing is also used to help eliminate turf grain (grass growing in one direction). Vertical mowing should be done only when the grass is growing vigorously. Late summer or early spring are the best times for cool-season grasses, while late spring and summer are best for warm-season grasses.<p>
In some cases, dethatching will create thin or bald spots in the lawn. Weeds may become troublesome in these areas, therefore weed management will be important following dethatching.<p>
<h4>Other Cultural Practices</h4>
Other management practices that contribute to the overall health of turf include overseeding, topdressing, and pest control. Overseeding a lawn area may become necessary if the turf has been neglected over a long time. This activity involves seeding the lawn area and treating it like a newly seeded area until the new seedlings are established. Overseeding is often a component of turfgrass renovation. In some situations, such as on golf courses, cool-season grasses may be overseeded in warm-season grasses to prolong actively growing, green areas.<p>
To topdress a lawn, spread a thin layer of soil, compost, or humus over its surface. Topdressing is often used in combination with fertilizing, aerating, raking, or vertical mowing for the control of thatch. Topdressing is also a common practice following sodding. It may also help to level the turf for improved water penetration and mowing. This practice is mostly used on golf courses.<p>
The management practices described above will help to maintain lawns in a healthy condition. However, pests will occasionally invade a lawn area, and their control is critical to the long-term health of the lawn. Pesticides may be required from time to time. When controlling pests, identify the pest, select the appropriate means to control it, and apply the control at the appropriate time.<p>

<h1>Training Young Pecan Trees</h1>
<h2>Guide H-605<br>
PH 4-600</h2>
<h3>Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</h3>

The first five years of growth are the most important in developing a central leader and scaffold branch framework of the pecan tree. Structural developments in the trees during these years will be evident 30 or 40 years later. Pecan growers will exert few influences that will be effective longer than those exercised in developing the framework of a young pecan tree. This development should be done carefully with a minimum amount of pruning. Considerable planning is required to properly train and prune young trees. Mechanical equipment used for orchard management will influence the training program chosen. Keep in mind the ideally structured tree and always try to shape each tree to this pattern. No two trees are alike and only a few will conform exactly to your picture, but it will serve as a standard.<p>
The type and amount of training and pruning that should be used can be determined, to a considerable extent, by the ultimate use of the tree. Early nut production is directly related to the amount of pruning, with the earliest production being on trees subjected to the least pruning. Backyard growers may be willing to sacrifice some early production in order to have an aesthetically well-shaped tree. However, commercial growers with a large number of pecan trees are more likely to compromise some structural development and form to obtain early production from their trees.<p>
There are several pruning methods commonly used for training young pecan trees. Heading back, branch selection, tip pruning and pinching are all good methods and need to be practiced during the first few years when establishment of new pecan trees and proper training is critical.<p>

<h3>Heading Back</h3>

To develop a medium-size strong, wind-resistant tree for the west, use a central leader or modified central leader system. At planting time, prune the top one-half of the tree (figure 1). This usually results in a whip 36 to 42 inches tall. Cut-back pruning encourages strong central leader regrowth. Frequently two or three new shoots develop adjacent to the cut-back point in the early spring. The strongest and most vigorous shoot should be selected around June (figure 2a). All other shoots should be removed. Lateral shoots will also develop below the cutback point. These lateral shoots can develop into small permanent scaffold limbs. They can be pinched during the summer and usually tippruned in the winter. However, transplanted trees usually grow slowly during the first season. If growth has not started by July, cut back to 12 inches above the bud union, to force growth. <p>
The previous year's growth of the central leader should be cut back about one-third during the first through fourth (or fifth depending on development) dormant season. Continue to force one strong shoot to grow at the top of the tree (figures 2b, 3b, 4b, and 5). Every summer the strongest shoot growing on the top should be selected (figures 2a, 3a and 4a). Other side shoots developing below, which will not be selected for permanent scaffold limbs, should not be removed until they are 1 inch in diameter. Their purpose is to manufacture food for central leader extension, sun protection and girth development. In addition, these lower branches will produce nuts until weakened by excess shade.<p>


<h3>Branch Selection</h3>

When selecting branches that will become permanent scaffold limbs, choose only the branches that form wide angles with the central leader. The selection of the main lateral scaffold branches should be delayed until the dormant period after the first year of growth. It is important to know that at each node (growing point) primary, secondary and tertiary buds occur.<p>
Scaffold branches from the main central leader trunk may be formed from primary, secondary or tertiary buds. Those formed from primary buds usually produce narrow crotch angles, and are weaker than scaffolds formed from secondary or tertiary buds. Those should not be used in developing the major scaffold branches of the framework. The shoot from the primary bud may be pruned or pinched out to force the development of a shoot from the secondary bud. The same procedure, pruning or pinching both primary and secondary buds, may be used if a scaffold branch is desired from a tertiary bud.<p>
The main trunk or central leader from which the scaffold branches are formed is more easilydeveloped from a primary bud with its natural tendency for upright growth so the center of the tree will be erect.<p>
When training a young pecan tree, 6 to 10 side branches arranged in a spiral around the central leader are selected and spaced 8 to 14 inches apart. Trees having several small scaffold branches can be harvested more easily with a mechanical shaker than those having only two or three large branches. The lowest scaffold branch should not be higher than necessary for attaching the shaking machine. The exact height will be determined by the type of harvesting equipment to be used.<p>
Lateral branches frequently grow in clusters instead of the ideal spiral arrangement. When this happens, select the most ideally located one, prune it in the dormant season and shorten the others to a few inches to reduce vigor. Trunks with two central leaders should be pruned because splitting may occur at the junction. If two upright trunks of equal size develop, one must be removed. This should be done as early in the life of the tree as possible. This reduces the probability of "V" trunk development.<p>
Crow's foot is the development of four to six shoots from the end of a young limb. Thin out the limbs so that only two or three remain. Tip-pruning significantly reduces the crow's foot problem. All pruning should be done during the dormant season.<p>


<h3>Tip-Pruning</h3>

Most cultivars produce extremely vigorous growth in the third, fourth and fifth seasons. Tipping these vigorous shoots will produce many lateral branches, the most desirable can then be selected for further training. Tip-pruning is practiced on permanent limbs by removing about two inches of terminal growth during the dormant season. Shoots are tip-pruned only when they are 32 inches or longer (figures 2b, 3b, 4b and 5). This practice stimulates the development of numerous small lateral shoots. Heading back (removal of 1/3 to 1/2 of the shoot length) instead of tip-pruning will usually result in the development of three or four strong shoots directly below the pruning cut.<p>
Tip-pruning will bring pecan trees into commercial bearing at an earlier age and encourage central leader development. It also reduces tree size during the first 10 years. It has been recommended to tip-prune trees until the 6th or 7th year. It is not needed on larger, bearing trees.<p>


<h3>Pinching</h3>
This pruning is accomplished on trees less than four years old. As small scaffold limbs develop along the trunk, pinching is performed by removing their soft, light green growing points. The growing point can be easily broken off with the fingers. Lateral shoots should grow 12 to 18 inches before the growing point is removed during the first season, and 12 to 32 inches during the second, third and fourth growing seasons (figures 2a, 3a and 4a). Pinching results in larger leaves on the lateral shoots. It also inhibits development of large scaffold limbs during the first four years of the tree's life and encourages strong leader development.<p>


<h3>Shaping Takes Time</h3>

Almost all pruning necessary on young trees can be done during the growing season, if done as soon as needed. Trees trained and pruned in this manner will seldom require the use of a pruning saw.<p>
At least five years are needed to complete the selection of scaffold branches and train the tree to the proper form. Each tree will be different although you attempted to make them appear uniform. It is impossible to select branches on a tree that conform exactly to your ideal, but if you continue to compare each tree with your mental picture of an ideal pecan tree, your orchard will produce maximum yields of high quality nuts.<p>

<h1>Planting Pecan Trees</h1>
<h2>Guide H-608<br>
PH 3-400</h2>
<h3>Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</h3>

Pecan nursery stock varies substantially in trunk diameter (caliper) and height. Trees may have a 3-to 4-year-old rootstock (plant coming from seed) and a 1- or 2-year-old scion (top coming from a bud propagated on the rootstock). Three-year-old rootstock with 1-year-old scion is most common in nursery stock. Select a scion with a caliper of 5/8 inch to 1 inch at about 4 to 6 inches above the bud union. Nursery stock with thicker caliper is usually more expensive and may suffer more severe transplant shock. The rootstock should have a strong taproot but, more important, it should have numerous pencil-sized lateral roots along the tap root.<p>
Fully dormant pecan trees can be planted as bare-roots during the winter season. February is the best time to plant because it provides enough time before spring for roots to become established. Trees planted early in the planting season will be established sooner and will develop new roots faster to support the spring growth. Nursery stock should be ordered in early fall to ensure acquisition of selected varieties. Plant at least two varieties to ensure pollination. Varieties suggested for planting in New Mexico include 'Western Schley', 'Cheyenne', 'Ideal' ('Bradley') and 'Wichita'. The last two varieties are recommended as good pollinators.<p>
In the shorter growing season of northern New Mexico these varieties will not bear fruit. Growers should try varieties developed in northern U.S. such as 'Major', 'Peruque' (early pollen shed) 'Fritz', 'Hodge' (late pollen shed) or 'Sullivan' (recent NMSU release). These varieties require fewer days from bloom to maturity.<p>
In laying out an orchard, it is important to first establish a straight base line to ensure straightness. Second, a perpendicular line must be laid out according to given reference points. Some growers use a rope with three knots whenever a tree needs to be placed. These three knots will be used to form a triangle shape; the two short sides of the triangle will have the same length as the tree spacing (15' x 30', 30' x 30', 30' x 60'). The longest side will represent the length of the diagonal made when the rectangle (or square) shape made by the planting design is cut in two triangles. The rope with a triangle shape is placed with one of the short sides on the start of the base line, and two tree-positions can be marked; one is the base line and the other is the adjacent row. The triangle-shaped rope can then be moved over the base line first; then the rope can be moved to the next line, and so on.<p>
Trees need to be stored properly if they are not going to be planted immediately. Roots should be kept out of the sun and drying winds. Exposure will dry out roots and decrease survival potential. Trees should be stored under shade with the roots comp]etely covered with moist soil, peat, sphagnum moss, sawdust or similar material. It is important that roots be kept moist at all times.<p>
Holes should be dug before the trees arrive from the nursery. The holes must be large enough to place the roots of the young trees in a normal (spread) position, deep enough to accommodate the length of the roots and for the tree to be set to such a depth that the bud union will be approximately 4 inches above the ultimate soil level. Holes are usually 3' x 3' with a 3' to 4' depth. Keep in mind that the soil tends to settle somewhat after the tree is planted. With heavier soil, holes should be about 18 inches deeper than the tree roots and backfilled before planting.<p>
The survival of newly planted pecan trees is dependent largely on the care they receive from the time they leave the nursery until growth begins in the spring. For the best results, observe the following instructions:<p>
<ol>
<li> Set trees out as quickly as possible. Heel in trees in a shady place and keep roots moist if they cannot be set immediately upon arrival from the nursery.<p>

<li> Dig holes large enough to spread roots out without cramping, usually 2-3 feet wide and deep enough to accommodate the length of the tap roots. With heavy soils, holes should be about 18 inches deeper than the length of the tap root.<p>

<li> Remove packing material which was placed around roots to keep them moist. Soak roots for one hour in water before planting.<p>

<li> Ultimate position of the tree in the hole should be the same depth as it had when grown in the nursery. You can tell where the ground line was by the difference in bark color. Because the soil tends to settle down a bit a few days after planting, trees should be planted a couple of inches deeper so they will end up planted at the right depth. Trees planted too deep or too shallow may not live.<p>

<li> Spread lateral roots out and work good topsoil around them as you fill the hole. Do not push the lateral roots down against the tap root. If soil has a lot of clay or sand, mix in one bushel of peat moss, leaf-mold or well-rotted compost.<p>

<li> When the hole is half full with loose topsoil, pour in at least 5 gallons of water to settle soil around the roots. Fill hole within 6 inches of the surface and water again. After the water settles, finish filling the hole with loose topsoil and leave a basin around the tree of sufficient size to hold 10 gallons of water. (Do not tramp the soil - this may damage the lateral roots and compact heavy soil.)<p>

<li> Pruning 1/3 to 1/2 of the top is one secret of getting trees to thrive. If this was not done at the nursery, prune after planting. Prune all lateral branches to six-inch stubs. (Growth on these stubs the first year or two will help protect the trunk from sunscald). Newly transplanted trees grow slowly. However, if they have not budded out by late June, cut them back again to force growth on the rmaining trunk.<p>

<li> Do not mix barnyard manure or commercial fertilizer with soil when backfilling as burning of roots may result. One-fourth pound of urea or similar nitrogen formulation and 1/8 pound zinc chelates per tree may be applied shortly after leaves appear.<p>

<li> Water thoroughly monthly until leaves appear, then water every 7 to 10 days. Thorough watering to the full depth of the roots is essential. If poorly drained soil is used, avoid ponding water around the base of the tree for more than 2 hours.<p>

<li> Keep soil free of weeds in an area extending at least 3 feet from the trunk.<p>

<li> Growth of newly transplanted pecan trees is usually limited the first year, leaving the trunk exposed to possible sunscald. Wrap the trunk loosely, with aluminum foil, burlap, heavy paper or special tree trunk protectors. Trunks can also be whitewashed to reflect sunlight.<p>

<h1>Transplanting Mature Pecan Trees</H2>
<H2>Guide H-627</H2>
<H3>Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</H3>
This publication is scheduled to be updated and reissued 8/99.<P>

High-density planting of pecan tree increases nut production on a per-acre basis. Increasing the number of fruiting shoots above an acre of land is the main purpose behind the idea of planting more trees per acre. Planting pecan trees 15' X 15' (192 trees per acre) or 15'X 30' (96 trees per acre) for maximum utilization of available land seems to be the best practice in the irrigated areas of the West. High land values make it almost economically impossible to justify the resulting bare areas when spacing trees 30'X 30' (48 trees per acre). Inter-cropping may be another alternative, but most crops will be competing with trees for water and nutrients. Furthermore, most crops will need water at different times than pecan trees. More and more growers are making ultra-high density plantings (15'X 15' or 15'X 30'). Orchards are thinned out 6 to 10 years later, depending on the original planting distance, usually temporary trees are transplanted to another location.<P>

There is no doubt that the newly transplanted trees will produce pecans earlier and in more quantities than young trees that would be planted the same year. Therefore, the grower will be ahead when transplanting mature pecan trees in spite of the higher costs involved. However, the time when the trees are to be thinned out from the original orchard seems to be critical.<P>

There are reports showing that trees spaced 15' X 30' have outyielded, on a per-acre basis, trees planted 30'X 30'. This increased production will usually pay for the extra investment needed for additional trees and cultural costs, and will result in a greater net income. However, the grower needs to remember that thinning trees out of the original orchard has to be done before trees begin to compete with each other. When pecan trees begin to produce top growth in the upper branches, this vigorous growth will shade out lower branches. As trees get taller, a point is reached where production begins to decline along with nut quality. Growers need to watch the trees for any sign of weak growth because of competition among trees, and they also need to keep good production records.<P>

A tree's age when tree thinning is needed in the original orchard depends on soil fertility and cultural practices. Good soil fertility and good cultural practices, especially irrigation and fertilization, make the trees grow faster and lower branches will be shaded earlier. If the optimum transplanting time is delayed, both temporary and permanent trees will suffer and be set back in terms of pecan production. Increased production from the permanent trees, 2 or 3 years after orchards have been thinned out, indicates the orchard should have been thinned out earlier.<P>

Once a decision has been reached about transplanting pecan trees, a plan has to be outlined to ensure a smooth transplanting operation. Transplanting involves more than just moving the tree to its final location. It involves several cultural practices such as proper pruning techniques, tree removal, transporting and planting, irrigation, training and fertilization.<P>

Pruning is a key factor in successfully transplanting mature trees. During winter, after trees to be transplanted have been selected, they should be pruned severely. Part of the root system is lost when a tree is transplanted, and the tree must be cut back to balance the root shortage. Leaving a single trunk 5 feet tall before transplanting has been the practice followed by most growers, especially when trees are around 12 inches in diameter. Other growers have transplanted trees with 6 to 8 inches of trunk diameter and a height of more than 15 feet. Three to four major limbs are left, cutting them back to about 2 to 3 feet. In any event, growers need to realize that the more foliage the tree produces the first year, the more critical the irrigation practices will be. Leaves will lose water to transpiration, and trees need to replenish that water quickly.<P>

No more pruning is done the first 2 years after transplanting because all the tree's foliage is needed to manufacture carbohydrates so the tree can form new shoots and roots. During the third year or later, remove the lower limbs and let the higher limbs grow and produce. Multiple branches tend to grow from the same place so prune to leave only one branch coming off the trunk at one place. Tip-pruning the remaining branches helps thicken them and will produce more laterals for better production.<P>

A central leader can be trained, but it will take several years to fully develop. Trees planned for transplanting during the next 2 years can be cut back as previously described. This encourages development of the permanent trees, filling the spaces made available and enhancing orchard productivity. Early pruned trees will need to be pruned again to the 5-foot height before transplanting. Two or three lateral limbs can be left but they need to be pruned back to about 2 feet in length. Because transplanted trees have lost a considerable amount of feeder roots, good water availability for the newly transplanted trees is critical to the success of the procedure. Transplanted trees have a limited root system, which needs to be watered more often than established trees. Water trees immediately after planting and every 2 weeks during the growing season. During hot days in the middle of summer, it is advisable to water more often, especially in light (sandy) soils. Transplanted mature trees get the maximum benefit from a drip irrigation system because water is applied only at the root system and at the right depth.<P>

Trees should not be fertilized the first year after transplanting, unless trees are planted in sandy soils and good shoot growth is occurring. During the  second  and  subsequent  years  after transplanting, fertilization rates will depend upon tree growth and fruit load.<P>

Tree transplanting needs to be done by specially designed machines (tree diggers) and well trained personnel. These diggers usually have six sharpened shovels that form a V-shape when all shovels are closed. These shovels make a 5-foot hole when digging a tree to be transplanted. Shovels are hydraulically operated and water is pumped into the holes as trees are being dug. This makes it easier to extract the root system and it also keeps the roots moist. Roots are usually cut without tearing and pulling; this encourages fast healing. After the tree is dug out, it is hauled to the new location where it will be planted in a hole with the same dimensions as the rootball of the tree being transplanted. The plug of soil removed from the new planting site is usually used to fill in the hole where another tree has already been dug from the orchard.<P>

Transplanting shock that may affect the trees, from delayed growth to tree death, can be avoided by conducting the operation during winter when trees are dormant. Maintain good soil moisture throughout the whole season, especially the first year. Successful tree transplantings have been done during summer by keeping the soil moist at all times.<P>

Mature transplanted trees have reportedly produced 1 or 2 pounds per tree 2 years after transplanting. Some trees have produced 10 pounds after 4 years. Fourteen-year-old trees have produced around 30 pounds 5 years after transplanting. Although most trees will not produce this many pecans, it gives an idea of bearing potential for transplanted mature trees.<P>

Some of the advantages of tree transplanting might be:<P>
<OL>
<LI>certain surface area in the farm can be used to grow other crops while some trees are grown for 6 to 8 years in an ultra-high density spacing.
<LI>more production per acre is possible for 6 to 8 years in an ultra-high density orchard, say 15' to 30', than in an orchard planted to the regular high density spacing of 30' X 30'.
<LI>when transplanting trees from a crowded (mature) orchard, permanent trees left behind will increase production sharply and could double yields in 3 to 4 years.

Pecan trees and most other woody plants have two distinct growth phases relative to the time the plants begin to bear fruit. The juvenile phase is the period when young trees cannot be induced to flower, even when exposed to appropriate conditions. The adult phase is initiated by the tree's ability to flower (fig. 1). There are other morphological changes that take place in pecans, in addition to flowering. These phenomena occur gradually rather than abruptly.<p>

NOTE: Figure 1 and Figure 2 are not available in HTML format. You may view them in the H-616.pdf file or contact the <a href="..ces">Cooperative Extension Office</a> for a hard copy.<p>


True juvenility applies only to seedling plants, those grown from seed. The non-flowering vegetative phase of asexually propagated plants (budded or grafted) is a different situation.<p>

<h3>Seedlings</h3>

<i>Juvenility</i> is a process that gradually declines over several years from the time a seed germinates until the tree begins fruit production. Pecan seedlings are characterized by rapid vegetative growth after seed germination. Typically, the young seedlings cannot be induced to flower during this period. A pecan tree will usually grow vigorously for the first 5 to 10 years, then vegetation growth declines as fruit production begins to increase.<p>

Juvenile features of pecan leaves are pronounced pubescence (hairiness), especially along the lower surface, midrib, and main veins, and a reddish coloration of young leaves and shoots in spring. Leaf pubescence and red coloration in pecan seedlings are less pronounced in the first year of growth, and more intense in the third year. Leaves formed in the first season are simple and entire (without leaflets).<p>

Young tree seedlings typically show a juvenile branching pattern, with a few long, whip-like shoots and narrow crotch angles in the early years. It is not uncommon for shoot growth to extend 3 to 6 feet in a single season. This is because there are fewer growing points (branches) on the tree, competition from other trees is minimal, and no energy is going into fruit production.<p>

Bark appearance is also different in the two phases. In the juvenile phase of pecan seedlings, there is heavier development of protective bark layers than in the adult part of the tree. The different types of bark are distinctly evident in budded or grafted pecan orchard trees. Because the rootstock was a juvenile seedling, the bark below the bud (graft) union is juvenile or rough in texture. Adult type bark is smoother and is found above the union because the tree from which budwood (graftwood) was taken was in the adult phase (many years removed from seed). Usually, the demarcation line at the union is sharp, clearly separating the rough juvenile bark from the budded top. As the grafted tree ages, the upper bark tends to flake off in large sectors while that of the rootstock is retained more tenaciously.<p>

There is a graduation of juvenility on a given seedling tree. These position effects have been called <i>topophysis</i> and are a consequence of the way a tree grows. It seems the root crown and trunk are in the juvenility phase, remaining juvenile both morphologically and physiologically. As a young tree continues to grow, a shoot-root transition or intermediate zone develops because the juvenile influence from the root crown is diluted. Finally, at the top of the leader shoots (youngest shoots), the adult phase or mature wood is found with the capacity to flower (fig. 2). First flowers on seedling trees thus tend to occur in the peripheral and upper zones of the tree, especially on shoots of favorable length and thickness with high stored food reserves.<p>

<i>Adult Phase</i>. Mature (adult) type leaves have a smooth, shiny luster compared to the dull, pubescent leaves found in the juvenile stage.<p>

Maturation occurs gradually in trees and does not necessarily involve every feature at the same time. There is no exact point at which the phase change from juvenile to adult takes place. Once a tree has progressed in time from the juvenile to adult stage, it still may be largely vegetative but is capable of producing flowers. As it ages further, the ratio of fruiting to vegetative growth increases gradually until it reaches a point where all parts of the tree are capable of producing flowers (figs. 1 and 2).<p>

<h3>Budded Trees</h3>

A different situation exists on commercially planted trees in New Mexico, which are usually from pecan tree nurseries where buds are taken from bearing trees and propagated onto seedling rootstocks. The bud is not juvenile and all growth from it is adult. The bud often produces a fruiting shoot the first year. A young grafted tree which has not yet produced fruit should not be considered juvenile. It is merely in the adult vegetative stage (fig. 1).<p>

Another characteristic difference between adult vegetative trees and juvenile seedlings is the location of the first fruit production. The juvenile tree usually produces first in the upper branches. The adult tree usually remains vegetative in the top, and will flower and fruit in lower branches. The latter situation is probably the result of more intense sunlight in the upper tree branches allowing more vigorous growth. Such vigorous shoot growth does not favor flower production.<p>

From the time the tree comes into economic production, it is a mature tree. There is another group of pruning operations that can help the producer increase or maintain yields and improve nut quality. The other pruning practices are usually accomplished during the training and establishment stage of orchard development.<p>

Mature trees are pruned to decrease shading, to remove bad limb angles, to remove dead limbs, and to remove lower branches to accommodate orchard equipment. Some of the hedging practices include:<p>
<br>
<h3>Mechanical Hedging</h3>
This pruning technique has received much discussion in the past 15 years. Some of the things we know about it are:<p>
<ul>
<li>	It should be done before the trees go out of production or have a chronic low nut quality problem. Annual records should be kept to learn when nut quantity and quality in pecan orchards are decreasing.<p>
<li>	It can be done economically.<p>
<li>	It increases yields and improves nut quality for a short period of time.<p>
<li>	Hedging is a temporary treatment and must be done again after three or four seasons, depending on the pruning system selected.<p>
<li>	Yield increases from hedging may be smaller with each successive hedging operation.<p>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Thinning or Complete Tree Removal</h3>
After three or four hedging treatments, benefits are reduced to a point where hedging may not be beneficial. The roots start to compete for moisture and nutrients and the trees will shade each other. The only economical treatment is to remove trees. This practice has been adopted in ultra-high-density and high-density orchards, but growers have been slow in deciding to remove trees after the stand has been expanded over the 30' x 30' or 35' x 35' spacing.<p>

The removal of trees from 30' x 30' spacing is a continuation of the sequence where the space has progressed from 15' x 30' to 30' x 30'. The first step is to remove 25% of the trees by taking out every other tree in every other row. This will give an immediate increase in nut quality and, by the second season after thinning, yields will increase. When the trees start to crowd at this spacing, more trees should be removed, to put the orchard on a 30' x 60' spacing. This thinning treatment should be increased to 60' x 60' in a few years, which will probably be the final spacing for the life of the orchard.<p>
<br>
<h3>Mature Tree Cut Back</h3>
In instances where trees were planted too close and were allowed to grow together and crowd, growers may try to correct the situation by cutting the trees back severely. This is commonly called <i>dehorning </i>or <i>pollarding</i>. This pruning process is not effective in bringing the trees back into full production. Part of a 50-year orchard in Mexico was pruned this way and the rest was pruned by tree removal. Under the tree removal system, the orchard was in full production in only 1 year. The trees that were dehorned were not in production 5 years after the dehorning process. A similar demonstration was conducted on a 60-year-old Stuart pecan orchard in Texas. Trees were severely dehorned or moderately dehorned. The severely dehorned trees have not produced pecans after 3 years.<p>
<br>
<h3>Corrective Pruning</h3>
A certain amount of corrective pruning must be done each year to maintain tree health and to accommodate orchard equipment. Narrow crotches should be removed. Complete branches should be routinely eliminated in the center of the tree to improve sunlight penetration. Branches that are getting in each other's way should also be eliminated routinely to prevent limb shading. Cuts should be made to the nearest crotch to prevent regrowth of suckers. This process will delay orchard crowding but, eventually, it will be necessary to thin the orchard or start mechanical hedging.<p>

Lower scaffold limbs that prevent clamping of the tree shaker during harvest must be removed. Limbs that are low enough, because of the tree's heavy crop, that tractor wheels will run over or damage them should be removed. Dead wood can be removed, but most producers just shake it out during harvest. Those orchards that have been hedged a couple of times usually have a large amount of dead limbs.<p>

One of the most expensive parts of any pruning operation, whether the orchard is being hedged or trees are being removed, is the removal of prunings. There are as many methods of removing the brush after pruning as there are orchards. Each producer will work out a procedure that fits his situation, labor force, and available equipment. Some firewood can be sold, which might offset some of the brush removal cost.<p>
<br>
<h3>Summary</h3>
Pruning mature trees is expensive but necessary. Most pruning operations that are done to maintain tree size and to reduce shading are temporary fixes at best, and are used to put off the ultimate pruning operation, which is the periodic removal of trees to maximize production and maintain quality.<p>

<TITLE>Buyers and Custom Shellers in the Western Pecan Growing Region</title>

<h1>Buyers and Custom Shellers in the Western Pecan Growing Region</h1>
<h2>Guide H-630</h2>
<h3>Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</h3>

There were 18 commercial pecan buyers and 13 custom shellers in the western pecan growing region as of October 1995 (tables 1 and 2). The western region includes west Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. About 60 million pounds of pecans were produced in the region in 1995.<P>

Most commercial shellers who traditionally buy big pecan lots in the region are not engaged in custom shelling pecans. However, cracking/shelling operations have been increasing in the area, most of them to serve small farmers.<P>

Most pecan buyers have similar standards for buying pecans. They prefer to buy pecans that have around 55% kernel (meat). Prices improve whenever pecans yield more than 55% meat and are lowered when they drop below that mark. Kernels should have the distinctive bright golden color of this region; however, around 4% amber color and 4% light is usually accepted without price penalty. Prices drop whenever the off-color increases in kernels.
Some buyers require a nut size of 70-75 nuts per pound and will penalize price if nuts are smaller. Most buyers give more attention to kernel percent and good golden color than to nut size, which is usually acceptable for 'Western' and 'Wichita', the varieties most planted in the region.<P>

Field moisture is also measured and the accepted standard is around 5%. Penalty price usually occurs when kernel moisture goes over 5%.<P>

Other characteristics affecting price are usually related to factors that affect nuts so they cannot be eaten. No credit is given for inedibles. Pre-germinated and shell-split nuts are observed mainly in 'Wichita' nuts but its occurrence changes from year to year. Embryo rot and poorly filled kernels also can occur in pecans. Nuts affected with any of these problems are usually eliminated, bringing kernel percent down and affecting the net return pecan growers receive. Stink bug damage (black spots in kernels) also affects the final grading. When only one spot is present, most pecan buyers eliminate the area where a given spot is located. Final kernel percent also will be affected.<P>

Pecan buyers (shellers) usually take four samples from a truck lot (one sample per 10,000 lb). Each sample is graded for kernel percentage, color, and non-edible nuts. A four-sample average is calculated before the final grade is given to a sampled lot.<P>

The New Mexico Department of Agriculture (NMDA) has offered a pecan grading service to growers during the past five years. This service has proven to be valuable when there is a disagreement in the final grade obtained by farmers and buyers. If this service is needed, call or bring samples to the Marketing and Development Division of NMDA, Las Cruces (505-646-4929).<P>

<h1>The Pecan Handbook</h1>
<h2>PH 1-100<br>
Guide H-631</h2>
<h3>Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</h3>

	Some of New Mexico's first pecan trees were planted in the early 1900s at the New Mexico State University horticulture farm by Fabian Garcia.  More pecan trees were planted across the Mesilla Valley in following years, and the first commercial pecan orchard was established by Dean Stahmann, Sr., south of Las Cruces in the 1930s.  By 1970, close to 9,000 acres of pecan orchards were established and more pecan trees were being planted.  New Mexico now has about 21,000 acres of pecan trees that produced about 36 million pounds of nuts in 1993 (figure 1).  There are no native pecan trees in New Mexico, and all producing pecans are improved varieties.  'Western Schley' is the variety grown most in the state.<p>
	The 1992 pecan survey conducted by the New Mexico Department of Agriculture indicated New Mexico had 25,280 acres of pecan trees and 80% of them were more than 10 years old.  Producers reported nearly 1,500 acres of trees had been transplanted or mature trees.  This is firm evidence that New Mexico's maximum pecan production is yet to come.<p>
	As that expansion comes, pecan growers will have to improve and expand pecan marketing techniques; however, it is equally important for them to manage their orchards in the best possible way to increase yields and reduce cost to improve profits.  Currently pecan growers are producing annual yields of 2,000 - 2,500 lb per acre, and these yields are the accepted standard throughout the Southwest.<p>
	Extension specialists and researchers at NMSU's College of Agriculture and Home Economics have worked together to assemble the information in the Pecan Handbook.  It is the kind of information that can be used to improve cultural practices in pecan orchards.  Although the information is primarily intended for New Mexico pecan growers, it can also be used by growers in Arizona, West Texas, and Northern Mexico.<p>
	This handbook, first published in 1983, was our first effort at this type of publication.  It has been well received by pecan growers.  The price covers only actual publication costs and it  has been updated as needed, when new recommendations come about through research findings.<p>
	It now seems this handbook has met the primary goal set for it early in the planning stage - helping New Mexico pecan growers, as well as other growers in the Western region, improve their pecan orchard management practices.<p>

<TITLE>Cotrolling Hickory Shuckworm</title>

<h1>Controlling Hickory Shuckworm</h1>
<h2>Guide H-633</h2>
<h3>L.M. English, Extension Entomologist</h3>

Most pecan workers rate the hickory shuckworm, <i>Cydia caryana </i>(Fitch), second only to the pecan weevil as a pecan pest. This pest is regulated in an attempt to stop it from moving west into Arizona and California. It has already moved into west Texas and New Mexico. In late 1990, the pest was confirmed within the city limits of El Paso. During the fall of 1991, seven hickory shuckworm moths were captured and identified in the Mesilla Valley from three locations in the southern end of the valley near the Texas-New Mexico border and five miles north of the Las Cruces city limits. It is imperative that everyone working in the New Mexico pecan industry become familiar with this pest to minimize its impact on the industry.<p>
<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
The hickory shuckworm is a native pest found throughout most of the eastern pecan growing area from Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas east to South Carolina. As the name implies, this pest is found on several species of hickory nuts. It has also been reported on black walnut. <p>
The adult hickory shuckworm is a small, gray to smokey-black colored moth about 3/8 inch long with a wing span of approximately 1/2 inch. Due to their size and the fact that they are most active at night, the adults are often difficult to find. The adults often rest on nut clusters or foliage close to clusters where they can be found by close examination during daylight hours. Pheromone and blacklight traps are also effective for capturing moths and are the preferred methods for taking surveys and making management decisions.*<p>
Eggs are deposited singly on the outside of the pecan nut shuck and sealed down with a gelatin-like material. This material becomes creamy, chalky white and is a distinctive characteristic of egg deposit sites. After a few days, the eggs hatch and the small larvae burrow into the shuck. The immature larvae are small white caterpillars. Full grown larvae are approximately 1/2 inch long, with creamy to dirty-white bodies, reddish brown heads, and conspicuous black spots over their abdomens. <p>
The pupae are found within the tunneled areas of the shuck, or protruding from small exit holes made by the larvae. They are golden brown to dark tan, and all their appendages are tightly molded to their bodies. Pupae are approximately 1/4 - 1/3 inch long. The adults emerge through slits in the backs of the pupae.<p>
The hickory shuckworm attacks from the time nuts are first formed in early June until harvest. Prior to shell hardening, larval feeding within the nut causes premature nut drop. After shell hardening, larvae are confined to feeding within the shuck. Damage resulting from the shuckmining activities of the larvae include poor kernel development (due to severed vascular tissue in the shuck), shuck sticking, scarred and discolored shell, and delayed nut maturity. Except for premature nut drop, shuckworm damage usually goes unnoticed unless the shuck is cut open to reveal larvae tunneling.<p>

*The New Mexico Department of Agriculture plans to continue pheromone trapping activity in New Mexico during 1992, and will alert area pecan growers if more hickory shuckworm are detected.<p>

<h3>SEASONAL HISTORY</h3>
Since these seven moths are the first confirmed captures of hickory shuckworm in New Mexico, we cannot be positive of seasonal history in the Mesilla Valley area. However, the seasonal history in other areas is reported as follows:<p>
"Hickory shuckworm overwinters as mature larvae within the shucks either on the ground or on the tree. Pupation occurs within the shuck, usually in late winter or early spring, with adult emergence beginning in late March or early April. In some areas adult shuckworms have been reported emerging as early as mid-February. Moths emerging in the spring, prior to nut formation, lay their eggs on pecan foliage, the galls of pecan phylloxera, and nuts of early developing hickories. Shuckworms hatching from eggs deposited on the foliage will generally die before completing their life cycle. However, those larvae developing within phylloxera galls or hickory nuts are able to complete their life cycle, thus maintaining the population until nut formation occurs. Researchers have also reported that adult moths of the overwintering generation emerge from the shucks as late as July, August and September. During the summer months, female shuckworms begin to deposit their eggs on the nuts. After nut formation occurs, shuckworm populations usually increase with each succeeding generation. The number of generations per year will vary from two to five depending on location."--<i> Pecan Growers Handbook, </i>GA.<p>
<h3>CONTROL MEASURES</h3>
Presently, there is no specific pest management program for this insect. Not only do control procedures vary from state to state, but they may also vary between orchards within a given state. Since this is a new pest to New Mexico, it is even more difficult to make specific recommendations to growers. However, here are a few common sense recommendations. <p>
Cultural practices may be used to reduce shuckworm infestations, and may reduce or eliminate the need to use insecticides under some circumstances. Where practical, remove or burn old shucks. Discing under old shucks, dropped nuts and debris will help prevent adults from emerging. (When discing, be careful not to damage roots.) Encourage your neighbors to follow these practices, too. <p>
You can use one of two schedules for applying insecticides: spraying on a fixed schedule, or monitoring with blacklight and pheromone traps and spraying as needed. If these traps are not available, you may have to spray on a fixed schedule. However, fixed-schedule spraying may not provide adequate control. <p>
Monitoring and spraying as necessary is a more efficient control method. If you are monitoring with blacklight and pheromone traps, you can detect shuckworm months, chart population growth, and monitor activity throughout the growing season. With this information, you can schedule spraying only when adult moths are present in critical numbers. In general, only the mid-summer generations (around shell hardening time) are numerous enough to require chemical control. <p>

The pesticides listed for control include:<br>

Because only seven moths were collected last year, it is doubtful that orchard populations will reach levels high enough to warrant pesticide spraying programs. However, orchard owners should monitor fields closely and consult with local county agents and agriculture field workers.<p>

<TITLE>Four-flap Grafting of Pecans</title>
</head>
<body BGCOLOR="#ffffff" text="#000000" link="#0000c0" vlink="#000090"><img src="/cahe/images/pr.gif" height=100 width=129 align=right alt="NMSU College of Agriculture & Home Economics">
<h1>Four-flap Grafting of Pecans</h1>
<h2>Guide H-634<br>
PH6-400</h2>
<h3>Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</h3>

The four-flap is a simple grafting procedure that does not require sophisticated materials. Nursery managers, commercial growers, and homeowners can use this grafting method efficiently. Because necessary cuts and "fits" of the four-flap graft are not as precise as most other pecan propagation methods, it is a good method for beginners. In the arid West, the four-flap graft seems to be a more sure propagation method than patch budding, expecially if an attempt is made to force the buds into growth the first year.<p>
The four-flap graft is successful because more cambium contact is made between the scion and the stock than with any other grafting procedure. The cambium is a green thin layer of cells located between the bark and wood, and is capable of dividing and forming new cells. The cambium contact between scion and stock is necessary for callus formation and a successful graft union.<p>
The biggest advantage of using the four-flap is the ability to graft small seedlings. Although the graft works best if the graftwood (scion) and stock are the same size, the graft can be made with scions 25% larger or smaller than the stock. Optimum stock (rootstock) and variety size for grafting is 3/8-1" diameter.<p>
<h3>COLLECTING AND STORING SCION WOOD</h3>
Grafting is often unsuccessful because graft-wood is not collected and stored properly. Desired varieties should be collected while the wood is dormant, in January or February in New Mexico.<p>
<li>Young trees produce vigorous growth and are generally excellent sources of scion wood. Do not collect scion wood that is 2-3 years old; for best results, collect wood from the previous season's growth.<p>
<li>Collect scion wood from disease-free trees.<p>
<li>Select one-year-old wood 1/2-1" diameter (or the thickness needed).<p>
<li>Cut the scion wood into 6-8" sticks.<p>
<li>Wax both ends, using either paraffin or wax to prevent drying out.<p>
<li>Tie the sticks in bundles of about 25 each.<p>
<li>Identify each variety with a tag or by some other method.<p>
<li>Wrap scions in a wet newspaper or paper towels, then put into a plastic bag and seal. Store in the hydrocooler of a refrigerator until it is time to graft. Do not store graftwood in a freezer.<p>
<H3>TIME TO GRAFT</h3>
Grafting may be started when buds begin breaking and the bark slips freely (from April to August in New Mexico). Grafting may be continued for several weeks. The stock of grafts that fail may be cut back again after about a month, and a new graft put into place.<p>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<ol>
<li>At a point where the stock seedling is straight and is about the size of the graftwood, cut the stock straight across with sharp pruning shears at the point where you want to make the graft. The stock should be about the same size as the graftwood. Place a small rubber band on the stock to be used later (1).<p>
<li>Make four vertical cuts 2-3" long and equally spaced (quartered) around the circumference of the stock. Make the cuts through the bark only (2).<p>
<li>Choose a smooth, straight scion variety stick  with the proper diameter. Cut to about 6" in length with two or three buds remaining above the graft point. With a sharp knife, cut the scion on four sides, starting the cut about 2" from the bottom end (3). Make the cut through the bark only.<p>
The end view will be square (4). NOTE: Many times only three cuts can be made due to the size of the graftwood. This is acceptable, but it is best to have four cuts if possible.<p>
When grafting a considerable amount of seedlings, it is better to use a device available in the market that can make the four cuts (or three if preferred) mechanically. This gadget will make the cuts simultaneously at the right depth and the right length (5).<p>
<li>Pull the four flaps of bark down on the stock like a banana, exposing 2-3" of white wood. Try not to touch the inner surfaces of these flaps (6).<p>
<li>With sharp pruning shears, cut and remove the exposed wood (plug). Be careful not to cut or damage the four flaps (7).<p>
<li>Insert the prepared end of the scion squarely against the stock (8).
Holding it upright, pull the four flaps in place to cover the four cut surfaces on the scion (9).<p>
Pull the rubber band up to secure the four flaps to aid in wrapping (10).<p>
<li>Wrap the cut areas with grafting tape. Overlap each wrap only enough to provide a complete seal. As you wrap, move the rubber band up the scion and remove it (11).<p>
<li>Cover the tape with a piece of regular household aluminum foil, shiny side out (12). Seal the top of the scion with a drop of white wood glue or shellac.<p>
<li>Slip a pint- or quart-size polyethylene bag down over the stock and tie with soft string or plain vinyl tape just below the foil on the stock (13). Covering the entire scion at this time may improve the chances for grafting survival. You can use rubber bands, budding strips, string, masking tape, or other tapes to secure the polyethylene bag in place.<p>
<li>When the buds on the scion begin to grow, cut the corner from the plastic bag and slip it down and tie the scion approximately 1" above the foil and to the stock 1 or 2" below the foil (14). <p>
</ol>*(Diagrams 1-15 are not available.  See pdf file or contact NMSU Agricultural Communications for a hard copy.)<p>
<h3>AFTERCARE</h3>
Keep growth on the stock in check throughout the first summer by removing the growing tips. This will cause a bushy trunk to develop, resulting in increased tree diameter and overall vigor. Stock growth can be used to regulate the graft growth rate. If the graft is growing slowly, remove most of the lateral growth on the stock. Should the graft make excessive growth that may cause the graftwood to break, allow the stock growth to remain longer. Normally, all growth on the stock below the desired height of the bottom limb is removed in two or three years.<p>
After the graft has made about a foot of growth, cut down the side of the bag and remove it. Unwrap the foil and either remove the masking tape or cut it carefully in several places so the tape can expand without girdling the graft. Wrap the plastic around the graft union again, wrap the foil over the outside of the plastic, and tie loosely. This will continue to protect the growing graft, yet allow it to expand. Remove the foil and bag the following winter.<p>
It is a good practice to tie a stick to the stock in two places below the graft to act as a stake for the growing graft. Tying the graft to this stake during the first season will make the graft main shoot grow straight and also keep the wind from blowing it off (15).<p>

<h1>Flood Irrigation In Pecan Orchards</h1>
<h2>Guide H-635<br>
PH 4-201</h2>
<h3>Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist<br>
Ted Sammis, Extension Agricultural Engineer</h3>

	Flood irrigation is the oldest and most common irrigation system used in New Mexico orchards.  Because it is an old method, many people think it is an inefficient, but this is not necessarily true.  Given the proper conditions of soil type, slope, length of water run, and flow rates, it can be a highly efficient. <p>

<h3>CHOOSING AN IRRIGATION SYSTEM</h3>

	Flood irrigation is generally well suited to mature orchards where the root zones are widely dispersed and the orchard is almost completely canopied.  It assures better distribution than sprinklers whose patterns might be disrupted by trees, and gives a more uniform wetted area than can be realistically accomplished by drip emitters.<p>

	The best systems consider soil type, slope, length of run and quantity of water available as integral parts of an efficient system.  For example, it would be difficult to get the proper water distribution using flood irrigation on sandy soil with a long length of run, and a relatively small stream of water.  In such a case, sprinklers, or micro irrigation systems might do a more efficient job.<p>

<h3>FACTORS IN SYSTEM DESIGN</h3>

	Flood system designs can be adjusted to work to greater advantage.  Grade or slope can be controlled through land leveling; application width can also be controlled using borders; another effective method for improving flood system efficiency is controlling the length of the water run.   The amount of water available to any one border at any one time can also be regulated for flood irrigation management.<p>

	All these techniques are site determined.  They can be adapted to almost any conditions, but those conditions must be taken into consideration before the system is designed.  The objective of any irrigation system is to put the water on the soil uniformly, at a non-erosive velocity, when needed.  Consequently, such considerations as the infiltration rate of the soil, the amount of water available at any one time, the slope, the length of run and availability of labor to manage the water all affect the overall efficiency of the system.  The amount of water applied can be measured using an inexpensive flume made of two pieces of PVC pipe.  Guide details instructions for constructing, installing, and calibrating such an instrument.<p>

<h3>DEAD-LEVEL IRRIGATION</h3>

	Laser leveling has become common in pecan orchards in the last five years; dead level irrigation usually follows laser leveling.  Dead-level irrigation allows the grower to apply only the water needed to refill the root zone.  For this method to work properly, the volume of water needed for irrigation as must be applied as rapidly as possible in order to allow the same time for infiltration throughout the whole border.<p>

	Dead-level irrigation works only in short runs.  If the border lengths are too long it is better to use a graded border irrigation.  Border distances for dead-level irrigation will depend upon soil type and water quantity, but 300-500 feet in length is usually recommended.  Dead-level irrigations need a minimum of 3" per irrigation.  Whenever a high water flow is used with dead-level irrigation, an erosion control device may be needed at the turnout.<p>

	Irrigation efficiencies for dead-level irrigation can be as high as 80-85%, while irrigation efficiencies for graded borders run about 50-60%.<p>

<h3>OTHER CONSIDERATION</h3>

	Some pecan growers are using furrow-like irrigation in orchards because they do not have  sufficient water flow to irrigate the whole border uniformly.  Growers need to be sure that the quantity of water is enough to satisfy pecan-tree requirements, otherwise it is better to reduce the pecan acreage to be irrigated.  Light frequent irrigations are not recommended because only small amounts of water cover the whole area, wetting only a part of the root zone.<p>

	A visit with an experienced designer such as the engineering service of your local Soil Conservation Service work unit will save many headaches.<p>

	Manipulation of many of the variables discussed can overcome many deficiencies in your particular orchard location, but they are site specific, and each becomes compromise.  Consider all the factors and seek competent advise through your Extension Service, Soil Conservation Service (SCS), neighbors, consultants or others to put the best combination to work in your orchard.<p>

<h1>Estimating Water Needs For Pecans</h1>
<h2>Guide H-636<br>
PH 4-200</h2>
<h3>Ted Sammis, Extension Agricultural Engineer<br>
Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</h3>

<h3>SOIL WATER - HOLDING CAPACITY</h3>

	The first step in understanding the water needs of a pecan orchard is knowing how much water can be store in the root zone of the tree.	 If you are not sure of the water-holding capacity of your soil, contact your local Soil Conservation Service work unit for an evaluation.  They can furnish you with a reliable estimate after a field visit, or by using existing soil survey maps.<p>

	Generally, sandy soils can store only about 1 inch of water per foot of depth.  Heavy soils, such as clays, can store more than twice that much, or 2.7 inches per foot of depth.  Loams, which are mixtures of sands, clays, and silts in varying proportions, will fall in a range between 1 and 2.7 inches per foot of depth.<p>

	Information on soil types and root zone depth of your trees will give a realistic amount of water that can be applied at any one irrigation without causing water to be lost by seeping to depths deeper than the roots can reach.  Growers should check the soil moisture depth after each irrigation. Water should penetrate at least three feet.<p>


<h3>TREE WATER USAGE</h3>

	Pecan trees extract the moisture they need from soil in the root zone daily during the growing season.  The amount a tree withdraws may vary from a gallon or less for a young tree to as much as 150-250 gallons per day in a fully mature tree.  This water demand is the tree's peak (maximum) water use on the hottest day of the summer.  Water consumption is decreased before and after this maximum use.  "Consumptive use" is generally expressed in a withdrawal rate of a fractional amount of an inch of water per day for a area, enclosed by the drip line for a small tree or the total field for a mature orchard.  Consumptive use varies with the tree's growth and its stage of the nut-bearing cycle, but it generally falls in a range of 1/4" per day in the early season to a maximum of 1/2" per day during its peak, which occurs at the nut's watery stage.<p>

	Consumptive use by pecans varies with different geographic areas and climate conditions, but growers should plan for the possibility of applying the maximum amount which might be needed at the most critical time.<p>

	As soil moisture is depleted, it becomes more difficult for plant roots to extract needed moisture.  When about 50% has been depleted, soil moisture must be replaced.  In addition to reducing plant stress, this also gives leeway in watering operations with respect to the time required to cover the orchard.<p>


<h3>CALCULATING WATER NEEDS</h3>

	To illustrate the calculation of water needs, assume that you have a fully mature orchard using 0.4" of water per day on a 10-acre plot of loamed ground that can hold 2" of water per foot of depth.  The effective root zone is 3 feet.<p>

	If the field has been irrigated to a depth of 3 feet, it contains (3)x(2) = 6" of available moisture that is being extracted at the rate of 0.4" per day.  To reirrigate when about 50% of the soil moisture has been depleted, schedule an irrigation 8 days later, when 3" or more would have been depleted and should be replaced.<p>

	This example assumes 100% application efficiency, which is only theoretically possible.  If your application efficiency is 60% (which is more realistic for a flood system), apply 3" ˜ 0.6, or 5" of water, to supply the required amount to the soil.  Irrigation efficiencies are site-specific, but they must be determined in calculating water needs.<p>

	The ideal water management efficiency for a pecan orchard, which calls for optimum water moisture available (no stresses), leading to maximum protection potential is difficult to achieve in practice.  Stresses are often not visible and damage can occur.  Use an infrared thermometer could help detect water stresses at an early stage.  These stresses can then be corrected before any harm can occur.<p>

	Summer rainfall sometimes helps satisfy the water requirements, but most of the time in the arid Southwest, water from rainfall does not amount to much;  Growers, therefore, should not reduce the quantity of irregation water needed.<p>

	Do not forget to allow extra water if it is salty.  This is commonly referred to as the "leaching percentage":  the amount of extra water needed to flush salts out of the root zone.  This amount also is site-specific, but it should be included in your calculations.  Ten percent is a rough estimate for  moderately saline water, but the amount should be calculated from the results of an irrigation water analysis.<p>

To illustrate the best way to calculate water needs for a specific pecan orchard:<p>


Question: <i>How many acres maximum can be watered with an 8" well if a pecan orchard needs about 4.5 acre feet of water (54")?</i><p>
Use the following formula:  <i>QT = a d</i><p>
where:<p> 
<i>Q </i>= ft (to the third power)/sec of water coming from the pump<br>
<i>T </i>= hours to irrigate during the day<br>
<i>a </i>= acres<br>
<i>d </i>= depth (maximum irrigation needs during the year)<p>

Assume a discharge of 1000 gallons per minute (GPM) (for an 8" well); knowing that 450 GPM = 1 ft (to the third power)/sec; then 1000 GPM/450 GPM = 2.22 ft (to the third power)/sec for this well.<p>
<i>Q </i>= 2.22<br>
<i>T </i>= 18 hours<br>
<i>d </i>= 0.4 inches<br>
<i>a</i> = ?<p>
To find <i>a</i> (acres),use the formula <i>QT=ad</i>:<p>

2.22 ft (to the third power)/sec x 18 = <i>a </i>x 0.4 inch<p>
<pre>			2.22 x 18 = 99.9 (100 acres)
			________________
			      0.4</pre>
<i>Note:  A general rule of thumb used by some growers is 10 GPM per acre.</i><p>

Irrigation efficiency in pecan orchards is extremely important in the arid West where almost all the water needed come from irrigation water. Pecan trees extract the moisture they need from soil in the moist zone daily during the growing season. Pecan growers should check water penetration after each irrigation to ensure the appropriate soil moisture depth (about 3 ft after irrigating) for optimum tree growth.<p>
<br>
A practical and quick way to measure water penetration in the orchard floor is by using 1/2" construction rod or reinforced metal bar (rebar). It should be at least 4 ft long with one end sharpened and a 1-ft piece of rod welded on at the other end (fig. 1). Another piece can be welded on one side of the rod about 3 ft from the sharp end to help to push the rod down into the soil (fig. 2).<p>
<br>
Use the rod after all irrigation water has penetrated the orchard floor to determine if water has filled the root zone after an irrigation. About 24 hours after irrigation, push the rod down until it is impeded by dry soil. The distance the rod penetrates is depth of soil moisture penetration and should equal at least 3 ft, or the depth of the root zone. If the rod penetrates less than 3 ft, not enough water was applied during irrigation. If it goes beyond 3 ft, probably too much water was applied. In either case, the grower should make adjustments accordingly.<p>

<h4>Fig. 1</h4>
<img src="fig2 h-637 (GIF)"align=right>
Growers should also check soil moisture in the orchard between irrigations. This can be done using a soil auger (fig. 3) which can be pushed down into the orchard floor at various depths. Take soil samples from the auger and feel their moisture content by gently pressing them in your hand. This can be used as a "feel test" to estimate different levels of soil moisture content. (For more information on the "feel test," refer to NMSU CES Guide 400-A111.)<p>
<br>
By checking soil moisture before and after irrigating, pecan growers can learn more about the water-holding capacity of their pecan orchard soils, as well as the efficiency of their irrigation practices.<p><br>

<h1>Pecan Varieties for New Mexico</h1>
<h2>Guide H-639</h2>
<h3>Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</h3>

Pecan orchards are a long lasting and expensive investment, thus careful variety selection is one of the most important decisions a grower makes.<p>
Some factors to be taken into consideration when selecting a variety are regular production capacity, tree strength and branching properties, nut size and quality (for in-shell varieties), kernel percentage (for shelled varieties), maturity (date of shuck splitting), precocity (age of the tree when producing a full crop), pollination characteristics, and susceptibility to zinc and iron deficiency.<p>
Pecan production in New Mexico is limited to southern areas of the state because desirable commercial varieties require a long growing season. Selection of early-maturing varieties is of major importance because nuts of many varieties, even in southern New Mexico, fail to mature properly in some years because of short growing seasons.<p>
Important commercial varieties for New Mexico are 'Western Schley', 'Wichita', and 'Ideal'. Other varieties may appeal to homeowners, especially new varieties with Indian names, but most of them require longer seasons than those found in southern New Mexico, and these varieties are not well adapted for commercial orchards in New Mexico.<p>
Southern New Mexico's climate offers some advantages for pecan production. High light intensity tends to compensate for the disadvantage of a short growing season. Combined with good irrigation practices and suitable nitrogen fertilization, this stimulates more than adequate foliage development and rapid tree growth. However, because of low mean relative humidity and warm temperatures, special attention must be given to pollination. Varieties chosen for their pollination characteristics may be either pollenizers that shed pollen before their pistillate flowers are receptive (protandrous varieties), or pollenizers that release pollen after their stigma have become receptive (protogynous varieties). Planting more than one variety in an orchard or yard will help ensure adequate fruit set and nut production; select varieties that show some overlap in pollen shed and stigma receptivity characteristics.<p>
Dates and duration of pollen shedding and stigma receptivity of some pecan varieties were similar in research conducted at Las Cruces, New Mexico in 1960 through 1962 (table 1). 'Western Schley', 'Wichita', and 'Ideal' are pecan varieties that may grow better in southern New Mexico. 'Wichita' and 'Ideal' are used mainly as pollenizers. Other pecan varieties available, but not necessarily recommended for commercial pecan orchards in New Mexico, are 'Apache', 'Barton', 'Burkett', 'Cherokee', 'Cheyenne', 'Chickasaw', 'Choctaw', 'Comanche', 'Harper', 'Mesilla', 'Mohawk', 'Rincon', 'San Saba Improved', 'Shawnee', 'Shoshoni', 'Sioux', and 'Tejas'. Possible dates of pollen shed and stigma receptivity for some of these varieties are given in table 2.<p>
'Sullivan', a new variety released by New Mexico State University in 1983, may be considered for northern New Mexico because of its shorter growing season (table 3). 'Salopek', a variety released in 1990 by NMSU, could be a variety that may replace 'Wichita' in southern New Mexico. Other varieties grown mainly in northern states, to be considered for northern New Mexico, but for which there is no information, include 'Major', 'Peruque', and 'Giles' (protandrous); 'Colby' and 'Posey' (protogynous).<p>

<h3>RECOMMENDED VARIETIES</h3>
<b>Note:</b> Descriptions of the varieties do not include disease resistance characteristics, because no disease problems have been discovered in New Mexico.<p>
<h3><I>'Western Schley' </i>(also known as 'Western') (Protandrous).</h3>
This variety originated as a seedling. The tree is vigorous, a heavy producer, and starts bearing at an early age. It branches profusely and responds well to pruning, making it appropriate for closely spaced orchards. 'Western' is less susceptible to zinc deficiency than many other varieties. It is also less affected by water stress and heat then other cultivars.<p>
In New Mexico, more acres are planted to 'Western' than any other variety. It is a consistent producer, but tends to overload in some years, producing small nuts, low kernel percentage, and about 5-10% pops every year. Alternate bearing may develop because of the heavy bearing tendency and relatively late nut maturity. In some years, nuts remain in the shuck because of its late-maturing characteristic. 'Western' sheds its pollen before the pistils are receptive (protandrous), and should be pollinated by a late pollen-shedding (protogynous) variety such as 'Wichita'.<p>
The nuts are elongated, rounded on the basal (stem) end and tapered toward the apex. Shells are thin and brown with moderate dark brown stripes. The nuts are medium-sized (63-74/lb), although larger nuts may be produced in some seasons (52/lb). They yield 55-60% kernels. 'Western' nuts are well adapted to mechanical shelling, producing a high percentage of unbroken halves.<p>
<h3><i>'Wichita' </i>(Protogynous). </h3>
Parentage: 'Halbert' (female) and 'Mahan' (male).<p>
Trees produce good foliage, come into bearing at an early age, are productive, and mature early in the fall, about one week before 'Western'. 'Wichita' holds its foliage well into the fall, which aids in kernel maturation. The trees are moderately upright, grow rapidly when young, and branch readily. However, these trees are slow growers overall. The branches tend to form narrow angles, which may break where high winds occur frequently; however, branch selection can reduce this defect. Trees are susceptible to zinc deficiency, requiring adequate zinc management for proper leaf development and tree growth. Moisture stress affects 'Wichita' trees more than 'Western', causing them to have more "sticktights" at the end of the season after a freeze occurs.<p>
Although 'Wichita' trees tend to overbear, and can fall into a pattern of alternate bearing, this tendency is not as marked as it is in 'Western Schley' trees. Each cluster bears four or five nuts, and seven or more is not unusual. Nuts may be smaller in years of heavy production, but they will be well filled, usually so tightly that kernels are frequently chipped in cracking. In some years, especially when alternate periods of sunlight and cloudiness occur, 'Wichita' pecans tend to crack open along the area opposite the seams, causing pecans to drop.<p>
The nuts are large and have purplish black stripes and splotches on clear, brown shells. They are moderately elongated, with the apical end normally a little smaller than the basal end. 'Wichita' nuts are larger than 'Western Schley'. There may be 50-62/lb, although they sometimes average 44/lb. They yield 56-62% kernels. Unfortunately, kernels turn amber quickly when hot temperatures occur during harvest, a factor that could negatively affect its final price. Pecans should not be left on the tree too long at harvest time. 'Wichita' has two purposes: It can be sold to a sheller or retailed in-shell. 'Wichita' trees shed pollen late (protogynous) and are good pollenizers to the protandrous 'Western Schley'.<p>
'Wichita' pecans tend to go dormant later than other varieties. This may cause problems in orchards, especially young trees, whenever low temperatures occur early in the fall. Withholding water in late summer or early fall and avoiding nitrogen fertilization after June 30 helps young trees become dormant early and decreases the possibility of late fall or winter injuries. Painting tree trunks with whitewash, a practice recommended for all young pecan trees, will decrease trunk temperature during the day, especially on the southwest side, thus diminishing winter injury resulting from sudden temperature drops that occur in the evenings during the winter.<p>
<h3><i>'Ideal' ('Bradley') </i>(Protogynous).</h3>
Parentage unknown, probably of seedling origin.<p>
Trees grow rapidly but they are slower to come into bearing than 'Western Schley' and 'Wichita'. They are not heavy producers and do not have a tendency toward alternate bearing. When trees are young, they are susceptible to injury from severe fall freezes. The tree is a prolific catkin producer and sheds pollen late in the season. 'Ideal' trees usually have a large first fruit drop.<p>
Nuts of this variety have exceptionally good quality, with a high oil content and superb flavor. Unfortunately, they are small, 70-80/lb. The kernel yield is 55-60%.<p>
The oblong oval nuts are light brown with few markings. They separate easily from the thin shells. They are always well filled, even when trees are heavily loaded. They mature 10-14 days earlier than 'Western'. However, shucks do not appear to be open because they are almost round in shape.<p>
<h3>OTHER VARIETIES</h3>
<h3><i>'Apache' </i>(Protogynous). </h3>
Parentage: 'Burkett' (female) and 'Schley' (male).<p>
This variety combines good production and tree vigor with desirable nut qualities. The young trees are especially vigorous. The tree structure and foliage resemble those of its parents ('Burkett' and 'Schley').<p>
'Apache' nuts are blocky, a little longer than 'Burkett', and slightly flattened on the apex. The shells are thin, with color and markings like 'Western'. 'Apache' nuts fill well to yield about 60% kernels. The crop ripens a little later than 'Western', but the nuts are larger, 45-55/lb.<p>
<h3><i>'Barton' </i>(Protandrous).</h3>
Parentage: 'Moore' (female) and 'Success' (male).<p>
Nuts from this variety mature 10-14 days earlier than 'Western' and separate easily from the shucks. The trees bear when quite young and have a tendency toward biennial bearing in New Mexico. The trees are small- to medium-sized, well suited for close spacing. Rosette caused by zinc deficiency is a serious problem when 'Barton' trees are planted in high-alkaline soils or soils containing caliche. They may also be somewhat susceptible to cold.<p>
The nuts are light colored, smooth, attractive, medium to large (50-60/lb), oblong, and somewhat blocky with thin shells. The kernels are light colored and separate easily from the shell. The kernel yield ranges between 50 and 55%. Quality is excellent with high oil content and rich flavor.<p>
Other varieties perform better in New Mexico than 'Barton'; however, it can be a good variety for home plantings and for selling in-shell.<p>
<h3><i>'Burkett' </i>(Protogynous).</h3>
Parentage: Seedling origin.<p>
This variety is popular as a landscape tree or in the home orchard. These trees grow vigorously, producing a naturally symmetrical and spreading top. They are not outstanding in yield, but they make up for this to some extent by their rapid growth. The black pecan aphid seems to have a special affinity for 'Burkett' leaves.<p>
When well developed, the nuts are uniformly large, round, and have a distinctive flavor. The shells are moderately thin and the kernels are easily extracted in halves when shelled by hand. The round nuts are not adapted to machine shelling. The nuts are large, 45-60 to the pound. The kernel yield is 50-58%.<p>
Late maturing, 'Burkett' is adapted to long growing seasons and high temperatures. Nuts may be poorly filled when early freezes occur.<p>
<h3><i>'Cheyenne' </i>(Protandrous).</h3>
Parentage: 'Clark' (female) and 'Odom' (male).<p>
These are medium-sized trees with profuse lateral branching; limbs are relatively thin but strong. 'Cheyenne' trees have poor shoot growth and small leaves; however they are productive and come into production at an early age. Trees have a protandrous blooming characteristic, making them suitable to pollinate protogynous varieties such as 'Wichita'. This variety has some fruit set problems and has a tendency to alternate bearing.<p>
'Cheyenne' nuts are moderately blocky with blunt, rounded ends and are slightly pointed at the apex. The kernels have a nice golden color. They are relatively loose in the shell, and pieces separate readily. Parallel grooves in the kernel halves are open and smooth, so the intershell falls out easily in commercial shelling.<p>
Dark stripes and splotches at the apical end on a clear, brown shell make the nuts attractive. They are medium-sized, 55-60/lb, sometimes less. The kernel color is light and the oil content and flavor are excellent. A distinct characteristic of this variety is a slight wrinkling of the kernel surface. The nuts yield 57-61% kernels.<p>
<h3><i>'Cherokee' </i>(Protandrous).</h3>
Parentage: 'Schley' (female) and 'Evers' (male).<p>
This variety has not been adequately tested in New Mexico. 'Cherokee' was introduced because of its extreme precocity, high bearing characteristic, early nut maturity and high quality. It appears to be well suited for use in high density plantings as a temporary tree.<p>
The 'Cherokee' tree grows vigorously and branches profusely. It produces many nuts per cluster. The nuts mature early and are well shaped for commercial shelling. Nuts are medium sized, 50-70/lb. Shells are thin and the kernel yield is 55-60%. Kernels are of high quality. The shallow parallel grooves in the kernel halves permit easy release of the corky internal shell upon cracking, a characteristic that aids processing. However, its tendency to produce dark kernels makes it an unacceptable variety for some growers.<p>
<h3><i>'Chickasaw' </i>(Protogynous).</h3>
Parentage: 'Brooks' (female) and 'Evers' (male).<p>
This variety is recognized for its extreme precocity and early nut maturity, good foliage, and high quality. The trees are vigorous and branch profusely, even while young. These characteristics also make 'Chickasaw' suited for use in high-density plantings as a temporary tree.<p>
The nuts are borne in large clusters. They have a medium-thick shell and a satisfactory shape for shelling, although the basal end is considerably larger than the apex. They are medium-sized to small (55-75/lb). The parallel groves of the kernel halves permit free release of the corky internal shell upon cracking and shelling. Nuts yield 52-58% kernels.<p>
<h3><i>'Choctaw' </i>(Protogynous).</h3>
Parentage: 'Success' (female) and 'Mahan' (male).<p>
This variety requires a long growing season and may mature too late for use in some pecan-growing areas of New Mexico.<p>
The trees are vigorous, branch freely, and have the general appearance of eastern varieties. They begin to bud and leaf out late, which may protect them from late spring frosts. Leaves remain green until killed by a hard freeze, which may account for the late maturity of nuts. 'Choctaw' usually bears heavily.<p>
The nuts are large (40-50/lb) and symmetrical. The thin shucks open well when nuts are mature. The shells are thin and careful handling is needed to prevent shell breakage. Some nuts may split when hot dry days are followed by extremely wet periods. Some pecans are also broken during mechanical harvesting. The kernels separate well from the shell, are bright colored and smooth, and have a high oil content and rich flavor. Kernel yield is approximately 60%.<p>
<h3><i>'Comanche' </i>(Protogynous).</h3>
Parentage: 'Burkett' (female) and 'Success' (male).<p>
This variety produces a large nut, 35-50/lb. It is recommended for areas where 'Burkett' does well and is used principally for the in-shell trade. The nuts are more or less round, similar to those of 'Burkett', but with more shell markings. Shucks are medium thick and have ridges along each of the four sutures, also much like 'Burkett'.<p>
The trees are vigorous, with medium-sized leaves. They are reported to be difficult to train because they tend to produce narrow-angle crotches.<p>
'Comanche' kernels are bright colored, high quality, and free of the black pepper-like dots found on 'Burkett' kernels. The kernel yield is 52-57%.<p>
<h3><i>'Desirable' </i>(Protandrous).</h3>
Parentage: Unknown, probably 'Success' and 'Jewett'.<p>
This variety bears a large pecan with very good kernel quality. Nut shape is oblong or blocky with an obtuse base and an apex that varies from obtuse to obtuse-asymmetric. It is a regular producer, seldom producing massive crops that exhaust the tree or bring on alternate bearing. 'Desirable' takes approximately eight years to come into production. Young trees growing vigorously will break when subjected to heavy rains and high winds, like 'Wichitas'. 'Desirable' in the western region produces a tree with no alternate bearing, is drought tolerant, and exhibits no zinc deficiency. However, it produces a low average crop and low kernel yield (below 55%). The tree is moderately open and usually has a massive catkin production.<p>
<h3><i>'Harper' </i>(Protandrous).</h3>
Parentage: 'Mahan' (female) and 'Western Schley' (male).<p>
This cultivar was released in 1967 by the NMSU Agricultural Experiment Station. The buds break slightly later in the spring than 'Western' buds, giving 'Harper' a little more protection against late spring frosts. The trees tend to bear biennially, but less so than 'Western' or 'Wichita'.<p>
The nuts mature about 10 days earlier than 'Western' and are about 20% larger (53-60/lb), but sometimes do not fill well. They are longer in diameter than 'Western' and are more tapered from apex to base. Shucks separate from the nuts readily, leaving few stick-tights. The shell's outer surface is somewhat smoother than 'Western'. 'Harper' nuts have thin, medium-colored shells, moderately marked with black.<p>
The kernels are straw colored and relatively smooth. Grooves are straight, parallel, and of medium width and depth. Kernel quality is more uniform from year to year than either 'Western' or 'Wichita'. Shell-out yields 55-60% kernels.<p>
<h3><i>'Mesilla' </i>(Protandrous).</h3>
Parentage: 'Onliwon' (female) and 'Humble' (male).<br>
A cultivar released by NMSU-AES.<p>
This variety produces vigorous, stately trees that are excellent for landscaping, producing an abundance of both nuts and shade. The trees are precocious and prolific, and the abundant foliage is resistant to the black pecan aphid.<p>
Shucks separate readily from the nuts. 'Mesilla' may produce up to 10% blank nuts (pops) in some seasons. The nuts are large (47-55/lb), oval-oblong, dark brown with black stripes and sprinkled with small black pepper-like dots. Shells are medium to thick, but the kernels shell out well and are of excellent flavor. Kernel percentage ranges from 50-61%.<p>
<h3><i>'Mohawk' </i>(Protogynous).</h3>
Parentage: 'Success' (female) and 'Mahan' (male).<p>
The trees are vigorous with large foliage of the eastern type. Their growth habit is intermediate between erect and spreading. This variety was introduced because of its large (30-50/lb), attractive, high-quality nuts. Trees produce pecans at an early age. Nuts mature early and are particularly desirable for early in-shell retail marketing; however, they must be harvested two or three times each season. They grow well in areas like Ft. Stockton, Texas, but in New Mexico after reaching full production age (over 14 years old), trees tend to alternate bear and produce small low quality pecans.<p>
The nuts are blocky, similar to 'Stuart', but are slightly more elongated with more rounded ends. The flinty shell is thin with little soft inner shell. There is also little of the central septum between halves and it separates easily upon shelling. The kernel surface is fairly smooth, and the parallel grooves are shallow and open. Plump kernel development has not been consistent from year to year. Shell-out ranges between 55 and 60% kernels.<p>
<h3><i>'Pawnee' </i>(Protandrous).</h3>
Parentage: 'Mohawk' (female) and 'Starking Hardy Giant' (male).<p>
One of the latest varieties released by USDA, it has the characteristic of maturing exceptionally early, being prolific, and precocious. Trees probably have low chilling requirements. Tree form is very upright and narrow, making it appropriate for high density plantings. It has narrow but strong crotch angles. Once the tree begins full production, lower branches often droop. The tree is very tolerant to winter freezes. Nut shape is an oval that approaches being oblong. The base is round and the apex is cuspidate. Nut size is large, about 49/lb in young trees. Kernel percent is about 56-57%. Both nut size and kernel percent are expected to decrease when trees reach full production.<p>
<h3><i>'Rincon' </i>(Protogynous).</h3>
Parentage: 'Delmas' (female) and 'Onliwon' (male).<br>
A cultivar released by NMSU-AES.<p>
These trees are hardy, vigorous (especially when young), and produce vigorous, attractive foliage. They are slow to come into bearing, but bear consistently, relatively free from the biennial bearing habit.<p>
Nuts are large (45-50/lb), medium to thick shell, elongated, and dark brown with black stripes. The high-quality kernels shell out clean and are characteristically striped with small pepper-like dots. The kernel percentage ranges from 52-56%.<p>
<h3><i>'Salopek' </i>(Protogynous).</h3>
Parentage: 'Wichita' (female) and' Onliwon' (male). This variety was officially released in 1990 by the NMSU Agricultural Experiment Station.<p>
Little information is available in relation to tree growth. Nuts are oblong in shape with an oval cross section, the base is obtuse, while the apex shape is acute. The outer shell is thin, making nuts easy to crack and resulting in high percent of intact halves.<p>
<h3><i>'San Saba Improved' </i>(Protandrous).</h3>
Parentage: seedling.<p>
These trees are medium-sized and open-branched. Young trees grow reasonably well but are slow to bear. Once they start, they bear regularly without overload, but sometimes have a tendency to alternate bearing. Leaves drop early in the fall, which aids in harvesting. 'San Saba Improved' matures two to three weeks earlier than 'Western', and nuts separate readily from the shucks. On young trees, the nuts are a large, in-shell type, but when the tree ages it produces a smaller nut.<p>
The slightly elongated nuts are small, 72-77/lb. Kernel quality and high shell-out, 55-60%, make this variety popular with shellers.<p>
<h3><i>'Shawnee' </i>(Protogynous).</h3>
Parentage: 'Schley' (female) and 'Barton' (male).<p>
The trees grow vigorously but produce few lateral shoots. The leaves are of intermediate size. Because of its precocity, 'Shawnee' is well suited for close planting (temporary trees), and responds favorably to pruning. The variety is prolific, bearing well-filled, high-quality nuts, 50-70/lb. Nuts ripen early in the season.<p>
Nuts are light brown with relatively few dark stripes. They are slightly elongated, round at the center and at the base, but moderately flattened at the apex. The ends are relatively blunt, with the apex coming to a point. The thin shells account for the kernel yield of about 60%.<p>
Kernels are smooth with neat shallow parallel grooves on the dorsal side and little septum grooves on the ventral side and at the base. They are bright in color and have an excellent flavor and good keeping quality. This variety is a favorite with shellers, but it is also acceptable to the in-shell trade.<p>
<h3><i>'Shoshoni' </i>(Protogynous).</h3>
Parentage: 'Odom' (female) and 'Evers' (male).<p>
Trees are early bearing and heavy producers when young, making them ideal for temporary trees. They have strong branch crotches, early nut maturity, good nut quality, and an especially wide adaptability range. Trees are usually hardy to winter cold; they have withstood temperatures of 14°F without injury. This variety is worthy of trial plantings in more northern areas of New Mexico. The strong, upright growth habit of 'Shoshoni' may make it well adapted to high-density planting, needing less pruning than most other varieties. Trees are low producers after reaching full production stage.<p>
Nuts mature early, but with unusually heavy crops some cork may adhere to the kernels. Nuts tend to sprout in heavy rainfall later in the season in the West. The large nuts, 40-60/lb, have a shape suitable for shelling. Shelling quality is good, yielding a high percentage of whole kernel halves upon shelling. Shell-out ranges between 50 and 58%.<p>
<h3><i>'Sioux' </i>(Protogynous).</h3>
Parentage: 'Schley' (female) and 'Carmichael' (male).<p>
The nuts have exceedingly high kernel quality and are easily cracked and shelled with commercial machinery. The trees combine good vigor and high production, but they tend toward biennial bearing. Trees come into production at an early age and the crop ripens early to mid-season, earlier than 'Wichita' and considerably earlier than 'Western'. Trees tend to bloom early in the season, making than susceptible to late freezes.<p>
Like 'Wichita', 'Sioux' is precocious and offers possibilities in orchards where close spacing and annual pruning is practiced. The nuts are somewhat flat. Shells are medium brown with stripes. 'Sioux' produces smaller nuts than most varieties grown in New Mexico, 60-80/lb, but it is an excellent shelling pecan of extra-high quality.<p>
The smooth, bright kernels have high quality, an excellent appearance, and a high oil content of excellent flavor. The parallel grooves in the kernel halves are small and shallow, which makes for easy shelling. The kernel yield is 58-61%.<p>
<h3><i>'Stuart' </i>(Protogynous).</h3>
Parentage: seedling.<p>
'Stuart' is the most important pecan cultivar. It is widely planted in the Southeast and contributes a dominant percentage of the world's total pecan yield. Budbreak occurs relatively late for 'Stuart'. The canopy of young 'Stuart' trees is among the narrowest of all pecan cultivars. It forms an upright and compact tree. Branches have narrow crotch angles, and trees are very sensitive to overcrowding. Trees are not precocious. Nuts mature in early mid-season. However, shuck dehiscence is staggered over a long period, an undesirable trait, and the tree usually has to be shaken multiple times during harvest season. Nut shape is oblong with a round to obtuse base and an obtuse to obtuse-asymmetric apex. Nuts are blocky, having a classical shape among pecan cultivars. Nuts are large. With 46-52/lb, they have excellent shelling characteristics and produce a high percentage of halves. However, nuts have a low kernel percent, averaging 47-49%.<p>
<h3><i>'Sullivan' </i>(Protogynous).</h3>
Parentage: 'Stuart' (female) and 'Nugget' (male).<br>
A variety released by NMSU-AES in 1983.<p>
Named for Dr. Darrell T. Sullivan, professor emeritus in NMSU's horticulture department, this variety produces elongated nuts with thin shells and shallow, medium-wide kernel grooves, characteristics favorable for shelling. Nuts weigh slightly more than nuts from 'Western', but less than nuts from 'Wichita'. It averages 65/lb. Kernel percentage averages 56%. 'Sullivan' is suitable for planting in northern New Mexico areas where the growing season is too short for maturing 'Western'. 'Sullivan' averages about 175 days from pollination to shuck split. 'Sullivan' pecan nuts are usually on the ground before shucks split naturally on 'Western' or 'Wichita' pecan varieties.<p>
<h3><i>'Tejas' </i>(Protogynous).</h3>
Parentage: 'Mahan' (female) and 'Risien #1' (male).<p>
Trees have precocity, prolific bearing, extreme vigor, strong branch crotch angles, dense foliage, moderately early ripening, and excellent cracking and shelling qualities. They are alternate bearers. 'Tejas' is considered excellent for high-density planting or as a temporary tree, and is suitable for landscaping. It is an excellent pollenizer for most varieties because it sheds pollen for a long period of time. This is a vigorous tree that could be appealing for homeowners.<p>
The nuts are well shaped for commercial cracking and shelling. The dorsal parallels are shallow, so the corky internal shell separates easily from the kernels. Kernel shell-out is 50-56% and consists mostly of unbroken halves. Nuts are medium to small and somewhat variable, 50-75/lb.<p>

Adequate soil moisture content is critical to pecan producers in the arid Southwest. Water is essential for normal plant growth and makes up a large percentage of the overall weight of the plant. Irrigation is used to maintain proper soil moisture for achieving optimal yields and nut quality, thus it is essential that growers apply the right amount of water at the right time. Understanding the basic principles of soil moisture storage, measurements, and management is necessary for the efficient use of water in irrigated pecan orchards and to reduce the pollution potential from runoff and deep percolation.<p>
In general, soils are made up of (1) mineral matter, (2) organic matter, (3) water, and (4) air. Mineral and organic matter are the solids in soil, and may occupy 35-75% of the total soil volume. The remaining volume, or pore space, is occupied by air and water.<p>
The size and total volume of pore space are a function of both soil texture and structure. Clay soils can hold a large amount of water because of the large surface areas of the individual clay particles and the large number of very small pore spaces. Sandy soils, on the other hand, have relatively small surface areas on the sand particles and contain a smaller number of pore spaces, which are larger in size, and thus have a much lower water-holding capacity than clay soils. Knowing the water-holding capacity of soils is important in determining both the amount and frequency of irrigation (table 1).<p>

*Note: Tensiometers should be used on soil types 7 and 8.<p>

Soil moisture tension is a measurement of the energy or the force by which water is held by the soil. It is expressed in units of pressure. When soil water is at field capacity and soil moisture tension is low, the plant can readily extract water from the soil. As soil moisture is depleted, soil moisture tension increases, and it becomes more and more difficult for the plant to extract water. At the permanent wilting point, the soil contains some moisture but it is held so tightly that the plant cannot use any of it.<p>
Although plants can withdraw water to the permanent wilting point, their growth usually decreases before signs of permanent wilting occur. In order to obtain good yields and growth, soil moisture must be maintained above the wilting point. For many plants, including pecans, irrigation water should be applied before 50-60% of the available water is depleted.<p>
Soil acts as a "bank" to store water for crop use. Rain and irrigation are deposits, water used by the crop and soil evaporation is withdrawals. A daily balance of these deposits and withdrawals will give the amount of water remaining in the soil profile.<p>
The crop root zone is often viewed as a reservoir for these deposits and withdrawals. Irrigation is used to fill the soil reservoir or to bring the soil moisture content up to field capacity in order to store water for crop use. Thus, the depth of the root zone must be known to determine how much irrigation water is needed. Rooting depth is not constant, but increases as a plant grows. In addition, many factors such as high water tables, soil type changes in the soil profile, soil compaction, soil salinity, and soil fertility may restrict root development.<p>
The depth for soil moisture management in irrigation is often referred to as the "effective root zone" or the "effective rooting depth." Generally, the depth containing about 80% of the total root mass is used for estimating effective root zone depth. Of that depth, about 40% of the total water requirement comes from the top one-fourth of the root zone.<p>
Water requirements for pecans are not constant, but increase as the trees grow. When planning for irrigation, both the seasonal and peak water requirements for the crop being irrigated must be determined. In addition to the peak water use period, pecans have stages of growth in which significant yield or quality reductions will occur if adequate soil moisture levels are not maintained. Irrigations not only must be timed to minimize periods of water stress, but also must not exceed the available root zone storage, except as needed for leaching of excess salts.<p>
Pecan growers should measure soil moisture depth after irrigation to learn the water management efficiency in a particular orchard. Ideally, water should penetrate 3 feet. Whenever soil moisture penetrates deeper or shallower than 3 feet, water management practices must be corrected accordingly. Water penetration can be checked after each irrigation with a simple device built with a 1/2" construction rod. The rod should measure around 3 1/2 feet in length and have one end sharpened. A one-foot long rod welded across the other end makes a T-shaped handle. The rod penetrates wet soil easily, but does not penetrate dry soil. This rod can be used to learn the depth of the irrigation water penetration.<p>
Moisture depth should be uniform over the whole field between borders. The best time to measure soil moisture depth in a loamy soil after an irrigation should be about 24 hours, when soil saturation has drained to full capacity. It may take 36 hours in a heavy soil and about 16 hours in a sandy soil. A practical rule of thumb is to measure soil moisture depth whenever a grower can walk safely on the orchard ground.<p>
Soil moisture monitoring is an effective method for determining the amount of water to apply per irrigation. Several monitoring methods and devices are available to measure soil moisture and determine when pecans need water. Many of these devices can be connected to computer-controlled irrigation systems that automatically apply water only when it is needed. The four most common moisture measuring methods are:<p>
<b><i>The feel test.</i></b> A very simple test, one that can be fairly accurate for experienced irrigators. In this test, the soil is felt by hand to determine texture and moisture content at one-foot intervals in the effective root-zone area. Printed guides describing this process are available at county Extension offices and many Soil Conservation Service offices (table 2).<p>

<b><i>Fiberglass and gypsum blocks.</b></i> Soil electrical resistance varies with soil moisture content; therefore, porous blocks with electrical resistance elements can be used to measure changes in soil moisture content. Either fiberglass or gypsum blocks can be used. Gypsum blocks are gypsum-encased steel electrodes with insulated wire leads of differing lengths that are connected to a meter. This device determines soil moisture by measuring electrical flow through the soil. A set of three gypsum blocks, buried at one-foot intervals to a depth of three feet, should be used for each 40 acres of orchard, providing they comprise similar soil. Gypsum blocks tend to give inaccurate readings in very wet soils; thus they work better with crops that are not irrigated frequently. Because gypsum deteriorates, new blocks need to be installed each season. A resistance meter costs about $250, and each block costs about $5. Fiberglass blocks are not as common as gypsum blocks.<p>
<b><i>Tensiometers.</b></i> Tensiometers measure soil moisture tension, which is the amount of water that can be removed by suction in the same way a plant draws water from the soil. A tensiometer is a water-filled tube with a porous tip and a vacuum gauge. A hole is bored or dug in the soil to the desired depth, and the cup located at the bottom is punched firmly into the soil. Additional soil is packed around the cup and around the tube to ensure good contact with the soil. As the soil dries, water is pulled through the porous tip, and a negative pressure registers on the vacuum gauge. The most commonly used tensiometers are 12, 24, and 36" in length and measure soil moisture at one-, two-, and three-foot depths, respectively. Three tensiometers placed at these depths should also be used for 40 acres of orchard providing all acreage has similar soil.<p>
Tensiometers are most accurate in sandy soils when soil moisture is above 40% of field capacity. In clay soils, they are most accurate when soil moisture is below 75% of field capacity. Tensiometers are reusable, simple to install and read, and cost about $50-75 each. However, the instruments must be periodically refilled to replace the water that slowly moves into the surrounding soil.<p>
<b><i>Neutron probe.</b></i> A neutron probe uses a radioactive source and an electronic counter system to determine soil moisture by measuring the slowdown of neutrons as they strike water molecules in the soil. Neutron probes are more accurate than other monitoring methods because they are not affected by temperature and barometric pressure and are only slightly affected by the chemical composition of the soil and other factors. However, because of the extreme caution required when using low-level radioactive source material and the high cost of the equipment (about $4,000), the device is seldom practical for individual irrigators and small orchards.<p>
The neutron probe is used by first digging a hole with a soil auger, then driving a metal tube into the hole. The neutron source and counter are placed in the tube at the desired depth. The reading obtained in a unit of time is proportional to the moisture content of the surrounding soil. Neutron probes are extremely accurate, but calibration is critical.<p>
<b><i>Other measuring devices.</b></i> Several new devices have recently entered the market, including metered moisture probes and computerized irrigation-scheduling programs. New portable moisture meters usually consist of a three-foot (or more) probe with a sensor in the tip of the probe. The probe is pushed into the ground to the desired depth, and a meter on the T-shaped handle provides a moisture reading. These devices cost about $500. Devices that measure soil temperature and electrical conductivity (salts) are also available, but they cost up to $1,000. Some moisture meters can be attached to an optional data logger that will store information for later comparisons or for transferring records to a computer.<p>
Computerized irrigation-scheduling programs are based on evapotranspiration and on-site soil and weather data, so they require reliable and accurate weather data and detailed soil chemistry and textural information. These programs can be quite reliable, but the cost of equipment and time for data collection and entry is high; the program alone can cost over $10,000.<p>
To predict soil moisture conditions accurately and to schedule irrigation frequencies and amounts, the irrigator or farm manager must use a combination of these practices and theories. Knowing everything you can learn about your particular orchard's soil and soil/plant relationships is important. Further information can be obtained from your local county extension office or the Soil Conservation Service office.<p>

<h3>Calculating Pecan Tree Water Use</h3>

The rooting depth of mature pecan trees is normally considered to be 3 ft. Total available moisture varies from 1" per foot of root depth for a sandy soil to 2.7" per foot of root depth for a clay soil. Therefore, the total available soil moisture in the root zone can vary from 3&#45;8.1". Fifty percent of the total available soil moisture can be depleted without causing moisture stress to the pecan trees. Consequently, for a sandy soil, irrigation should occur after 1.5" of water has been consumed by pecans and for a clay soil, after 4.05" of water depletion. <p>

Because soil water-holding capacity varies from location to location, the available moisture needs to be determined for each specific soil. This is accomplished by measuring the moisture content at field capacity (soil water content 24 hours after irrigation) and then estimating the available water (the field capacity multiplied by 0.50). To determine soil field capacity, a soil sample is taken 24 hours after irrigation; moisture content in the sample, on a weighed basis, is determined by measuring the weight of the soil sample, drying it in an oven until the weight no longer changes, and then recording the final weight. The moisture content (weight basis) of a soil sample is calculated using this formula:<p>
<br>
<ul>
(wet weight - dry weight) &#247; dry weight = moisture content, weight basis.<p>
</ul>
<br>

<i>Example</i>: If the soil sample weighs 1000 g and the sample dry weighs 800 g, the percent moisture content on a dry weight basis is<p>
<br>
<ul>
(1000 - 800) &#247; 800 = 0.25. <p>
</ul>
<br>
The moisture content on a volume basis is calculated using this formula:<p>
<br>
<ul>
moisture content, weight basis x bulk density = moisture content, volume basis.<p>
</ul>
<br>
Bulk density varies from 1.65 for sandy soil to 1.25 for a clay soil (table 1). <p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Table 1.  Bulk density of soil according to soil texture.</h4>
<hr>
<pre>
		Soil Texture			Bulk density
<hr>
		   Sand				   1.65
		   Sandy loam			   1.50
		   Loam				   1.40
		   Clay loam			   1.35
		   Sandy clay			   1.30
		   Clay				   1.25<p>
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
<br>

<i>Example</i>: If the soil is a clay loam soil, the bulk density is 1.35. If the moisture content on a weight basis is .25, then moisture content on a volume basis is<p>
<br>
<ul>
.25 x 1.35 = 0.33.
</ul>
<br>
As previously stated, only 50% of the moisture is available for pecan tree consumption, therefore, total available moisture content is .33 x 0.5 = .165" of water per inch of soil. The available moisture per foot of soil would be .165 x 12" = 1.98" per foot of soil. The assumed root depth is 3 ft; consequently, there is 5.94" (3 x 1.98") of available moisture in the total root zone of a tree growing on a clay loam soil. At 50% depletion, only 2.97" can be depleted before it is time to irrigate again.<p>

To determine when to irrigate again, it is necessary to estimate the amount of water pecan trees extract each day. Trees' water usage is dependent on the weather, and weather-related information can be acquired in New Mexico by calling the New Mexico Climate Center Bulletin Board (NMSU, Las Cruces), which calculates potential evapotranspiration (PET) using climate data. <p>

In general, PET represents the water used by a grass cover, so it must be adjusted by a crop coefficient to determine the water used by pecans. For a mature orchard, this crop coefficient is 0.85. Consequently, if the PET for Las Cruces for the last 10 days was 2.5", then the water used by the pecan orchard would be 2.5" x .85 = 2.12". If we use 2.97" (50% depletion for a clay loam soil), only .85" (2.97" - 2.12") more could be depleted before irrigation is needed. This should occur in about four days (PET 2.5"/10 days = .25 per day; however, the crop coefficient for pecans is .85, so 2.5" x .85 = .21" per day).<p>
<br>
<h3>Using the Climate Center Bulletin Board through Procomm&#174;</h3>

To get PET and heat unit information from the Climate Center bulletin board, first access the "doors" option which, will open a menu. One of the options in that menu is to convert data to English or metric format. Select an option; the program will then ask you to select the starting and ending date for the desired data, a location from which you wish to convert PET data (choose the location nearest you), and heat unit cut-off and base temperatures. Since the maximum temperature at which pecan trees function has not been determined, enter these cut-off temperatures: 1100&#176;F for the maximum and 0&#176;F for the minimum. Enter 50&#176;F for the base temperature. The program will then calculate the PET and accumulated heat units, then deposit them in a "convert" location in the bulletin board where you may then view or download the data. To view or download the data file, enter the Files menu, then choose either View or Download followed by the filename. Continue with the on-screen directions. Once the file has been downloaded to your Procomm&#174; file, it may then be processed or printed. An example of this output is presented in fig. 1.<p>

<b>Note:</b> See the Guide H-641 PDF file for the example in fig. 1 or contact the <a href = "../ces">Cooperative Extension office</a> for a printed copy. Step-by-step directions for using this bulletin board with Procomm&#174; follow.<p>

The bulletin board can be accessed by calling over a modem using a communication package such as Procomm&#174;. First, at the computer's main menu, select the communications menu; press return. From the communications menu, choose Procomm; press return. Press any key to continue Procomm&#174;. The Procomm&#174; screen should be blank with code bars at the bottom of the screen. At the cursor type ATDT9-1-505-646-5362, press return, and wait a few minutes for the computer to respond. If the computer responds "No Carrier," redial the number until it connects with the bulletin board.<p>

<h3>Using the Climate Center Bulletin Board through the Internet</h3>

To access the BBS through the Internet, you must have an Internet account, and you also need to have Netscape TM or another World Wide Web browser. Using the BBS through the Internet is easier than using it through Procomm&#174;.<p>

The BBS address is <a href = "http://weather.nmsu.edu/">http://weather.nmsu.edu/</a>. At the climate BBS home page, click on Retrieve and Convert Weather Data.On this page, request the beginning and ending dates and a specific weather station. On this page you also can change the file format from English (Fahrenheit) to metric (centigrade), or vice versa. At "generic heat units max cutoff," enter 1100 (for pecans); at "generic heat units min cutoff," enter -999 (for pecans); at "base temperature," enter 50&#176;F. Click Submit Request. A warning may appear cautioning you about using credit card numbers; ignore this warning as credit card numbers and other sensitive data are not necessary for this operation. If you need to return to something in the BBS, simply point and click on the "back" button on the toolbar. To log out, select the File menu, then choose close. Unlike Procomm&#174;, you may stay logged on to the BBS through the Internet for as long as you like.<p>

Information from the bulletin board also can be used in conjunction with sophisticated irrigation scheduling computer programs available for IBM-compatible personal computers. Growers can load all information pertaining to orchard soils and obtain complimentary information from the climate bulletin board weekly.<p>

<h1>Fertigation for Pecan Orchards</h1>
<h2>Guide H-642</h2>
<h3>Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist<br>
Ted Sammis, Water Specialist</h3>

	More and more agricultural producers are using their irrigation systems to apply chemicals. This practice, termed chemigation, can be an effective application method provided the chemical is suited for the practice and the irrigation system is properly engineered. Today, chemigation can be broken down into newly created terms like fertigation, herbigation, fungigation, insectigation, and nemagation. Fertigation, the practice of applying fertilizer with irrigation water, is the most widely used form of chemigation. Fertigation actually began several centuries ago when farmers simply dumped animal manure into irrigation canals.<p>
	Conventional ways of applying dry fertilizer to pecan orchards are giving way to liquid fertilizers that apply nutrients through irrigation water. This process (fertigation) may have the advantage of reaching the whole root systems of pecan trees. Current technology allows the application of most essential nutrients through orchard drip or flood irrigation systems.<p>
	There are five factors to consider when applying fertilizer in irrigation water: 1) mobility of the fertilizer nutrient in the soil; 2) irrigation water quality-fertilizer combination effects; 3) fertilizer cost and effectiveness; 4) crop demand schedule for the nutrient; and 5) weather factors.<p>
Irrigation water quality can be affected favorably by applying a suitable nitrogen fertilizer in irrigation water. Because of the acidizing effects of some nitrogen fertilizers, applying nitrogen in marginal irrigation water may help to reduce the negative effects of high sodium and salt content by freeing exchangeable calcium in the soil. The calcium can then exchange for the adsorbed sodium, allowing the sodium salts to be leached from the soil. In addition, the acidifying effect of applying nitrogen fertilizer in irrigation water may increase the availability and retention of plant micronutrients.<p>
	UAN (urea-ammonium nitrate) solutions and ammonium thiosulfate are pressureless liquid fertilizers suitable for application through irrigation systems. Anhydrous ammonia is a high-pressure liquid that becomes a gas at atmospheric pressure. It may be applied by bubbling it into an irrigation canal at a point upstream of the field or border. The bubbler must be placed under at least six inches of flowing water in the ditch or canal, and the ratio of anhydrous ammonia to water should not exceed 100 parts per million (ppm). When any chemicals are applied through a drip irrigation system, New Mexico law requires the use of a safety backflow prevention device to prevent the flow of chemicals back into a well or public water system.<p>
	One source of nitrogen is not better than another. However, several characteristics should be considered before choosing a fertilizer for a specific purpose. Solubility, effect on soil pH, form of N, and associated nutrients are some of these considerations. Quality, rather than cost, should be the deciding factor in fertilizer selection.<p>
Ammonium sulfate is associated with lowering soil pH, thus preventing cotton root rot, to which pecans are susceptible. As a result, ammonium sulfate is often preferred for pecans. For application in irrigation water, ammonium thiosulfate would replace ammonium sulfate.<p>
	In general, pecan trees are slow to respond to nitrogen fertilizer applications. By applying nitrogen in the first irrigation water before bud break, pecan trees will have an ample supply during their greatest growth period and may show a quicker response. The amount of fertilizer needed by a pecan tree depends on its size, age, production, and soil type. In general, 150-200 lb/ac of actual nitrogen is recommended in established orchards. Cultural practices also influence the amount of fertilizer needed. Nitrogen fertilizers may be applied in split amounts with irrigations from March through July. Do not apply nitrogen to young trees after June because it may delay leaf fall and result in winter injury. For detailed information on fertilizer requirements and timing, obtain NMCES Guide H-602, "Pecan Orchard Fertilization."<p>
	If nutrients, especially nitrogen, are applied too early, they may be leached by spring rains or volatilize. Nutrient application with irrigation water can be done more often when the pecan trees have a heavy crop that requires large amounts of nitrogen and water, eliminating early applications when there is a greater risk of losing nitrogen.<p>

<h3>FLOAT CONTROL VALVE APPLICATION</h3>

Liquid fertilizer can be injected into an irrigation ditch using a float control valve. A normal flood irrigation for a pecan orchard would be 4-6". If the ditch carries 2,000 gpm, the time needed to apply a 6" irrigation to 10 acres is 13.5 hr. This is calculated using the formula<p>

<pre>				t = ad/q

where

t = hr
a = acres
d = inches to be irrigated
q = ft 3rd power/second [450 gpm = 1 ft 3rd power/second].

Apply the formula to the example:

				t = ad/q
			t = 10 X 6 / (2,000/450) 
				= 13.5 hr.
</pre>
	In this example, if 40 lb of N/acre are recommended for one irrigation, then 400 lb N must be applied (10 acres) in 13.5 hr or 30 lb N/acre hr. Assuming the fertilizer to be used is 33% N and has a density of 11 lb/gal, then the application rate is 2.72 gal N/hr (30 lb of N  11) or 8.26 gal fertilizer/hr (90.9 lb  11) for 30 lb of N/acre/hr. A float control valve can be connected to the fertilizer supply tank and set to apply the correct flow rate. The concentration of fertilizer in water or soil is measured in parts per million (ppm) on a weight basis, which means lb of fertilizer/lb of water. The weight of the water and the concentration of nitrogen in the water (ppm) are calculated by the following formulas:<p>
__________________________________________________________________________________<br>
Flow rate in ditch X density of water = weight of H2O/hr<p>
<i>Example:</i><br>
60 min X 2000 gpm X 8.3 lb/gal = 996,000 lb H2O/hr<br>
(or weight of irrigation water/hr)<br>
__________________________________________________________________________________<br>
__________________________________________________________________________________<br>
(Nitrogen rate per hour + weight of water/hr) = ppm<p>
<i>Example:</i><br>
(30 lb N hr + 996,000 lb H2O/hr)	= 0.000030 = 30 ppm<p>
__________________________________________________________________________________<p>

<h3>FERTILIZER INJECTION IN PRESSURIZED SYSTEMS</h3>
	
Dry fertilizer broadcast on the soil surface cannot be moved into the root zone effectively when the trees are drip irrigated because only a small area of soil is wet by drip emitters. However, fertilizer can be applied effectively through the irrigation system and this method is recommended. Excellent injection equipment is available that usually can be connected into the main pipeline so the fertilizer can be routed selectively to all trees in the orchard. To prevent emitter plugging, fertilizer must be injected upstream from the filter so all undissolved fertilizer material and precipitates will be contained by the filter. Select an injector that operates properly on the electrical voltage, water pressure, and water flow rate available in the orchard, and has adequate capacity to apply the fertilizer needs of pecan trees.<p>
	Highly soluble nitrogen fertilizers such as potassium nitrate, calcium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium polyphosphate, liquid uran, and urea nitrogen can be applied by the drip irrigation system. First, dissolve or mix dry fertilizer material in water to make the proper concentrate, making certain all fertilizer is in solution. Liquid nitrogen such as uran and urea normally can be applied undiluted by the irrigation system. Check for precipitate formation that can clog the emitters and filter by mixing appropriate amounts of the fertilizer solution and irrigation water prior to injection. A precipitate frequently forms when anhydrous ammonia is added to irrigation water because the pH of the water is raised and calcium and magnesium carbonates can precipitate. Other nitrogen fertilizers may also produce precipitates at high concentrations, especially with lower quality water.<p>
Begin fertilizer injection when the irrigation system is applying water at the normal rate. Check the application rate by timing the injection of a specific quantity of material. Complete injection before the irrigation cycle ends in order to move fertilizer out of the irrigation system and into the root zone. One to three hours may be required to move fertilizer material to trees at the ends of lateral pipelines, especially where only one emitter is used for each tree.<p>
	 Injector pumps come in three types. One type uses a piston or diaphragm mechanism at either a fixed or adjustable rate. The injection rate is not a function of flow rate. The second type is a piston-type proportional injector that pumps a proportional rate of fertilizer/water. A third type of is a venturi, which has an injection rate that is a function of pressure and flow rate.<p>
	
<h3>ADJUSTABLE RATE INJECTOR</h3>
	
	On an adjustable rate injector, the length of the piston stroke changes. The stroke length is set at a proportional rate of 0-10% of the maximum injection rate based on piston diameter. Injection rates vary from 0.18-163 gph. If nitrogen is injected continuously with the water, then the injection rate should be set to have approximately 30 ppm of N in the water. The 30 ppm is estimated by calculating the total weight of water applied to pecans to satisfy evapo-transporation over the time period fertilizer is injected and then dividing this number into the recommended seasonal nitrogen application. However if nitrogen is to be injected only periodically, then the injection rate should be high enough to inject the fertilizer in a reasonable time.<p>
	
<i>Example: </i>How long to run the injector to apply 1 lb of N per inch of tree from March to July.<p>
	
<i>Given:</i><br>
1)	Tree: 1" diameter<br>
2)	Fertilizer solution: 33% N<br>
3)	Emitters: four 1 gph emitters per tree<br>
4)	Number of trees: 400<br>
5)	Fertilization period: 20 weeks<br>
6)	Density of fertilizer: 11 lb/gal<br>
7)	Concentration of injected N: 250 ppm (250 X 10-6)<br>
8)	Density of water: 8.33 lb/gal<p>

<i>Solution:</i>
1)	If the fertilizer is to be injected weekly from March to June, then the injected amount is lb of fertilizer/ number of weeks.<p>

<pre>			1 lb N	   =	 .05 lb

3)	Calculate the lb of N in the water if the injection rate (concentration) is 250 ppm. The lb of N/hr is equal to the concentration in ppm times the weight of water per hour (flow rate).<p>
<pre>
			= 250 X 10-6 lb N/lb H2O X 33.3 lb/hr H2O 
			= .008 lb N/hr
</pre>
4)	The time to run the injector pump is the amount of fertilizer to apply divided by the application rate.<p>

<pre>			.05 lb
			________     = 	6.25 hr
			.008 lb/hr
</pre>
5)	The injector setting concentration (to achieve 250 ppm of N) in the water is calculated from the concentration of N ppm divided by the percent of N in the fertilizer.<p>

<pre>(250 X 10 (-6th power) lb N/lb H2O) 
__________________________________ = 758 X 10 (-6th power) lb fertilizer/lb H2O
	(0.33 lb N/lb fertilizer)
</pre>

6)	Fertilizer injectors inject a specific volume of fertilizer. Convert the concentration on a weight basis to a volume basis by multiplying the concentration by the density of water and dividing by the density of the fertilizer.<p>
<pre>
	(758 X 10-6 lb fertilizer/lb H2O X 8.33 lb gal H2O)
	__________________________________________________
		   (11 lb fertilizer/gal fertilizer) 

		= 573 X 10 (-6th power) gal fertilizer/gal H2O 
		= 573 ppm (volume basis)
</pre>

7)	Calculate the injector rate by using the known flow rate of the specific system, times the concentration of the fertilizer on a volume basis.<p>
<pre>
		400 trees X 4 gal/hr = 1,600 gal/hr

	1,600 gal/hr X 573 X 10 (-6th power) gal fertilizer/gal H2O 

		     = 0.92 gal fertilizer/hr
</pre>
8)	Select an injector with a flow rate range within the injection rate. As an example, an adjustable injector has a flow rate of 0.2 to 1.96 gph.<p>

9)	Set the scale adjustment on the injector by dividing the needed injection rate of the fertilizer by the maximum injector setting.<p>
<pre>
		0.92 gal fertilizer/hr
		____________________ = 0.47 (or 4.7 on a scale of 10)
		     1.96 gal/hr
</pre>
<h3>Proportional Injection</h3>

	On a proportional injector type, the size is based on the flow rate of the injector, which is rated in gpm. The flow rate of the system is:<p>

1.	1,600 gal/hr = 26.6 gpm<p>

2.	An injector with a flow rate range of 2.2-40 gpm will handle the flow rate needed.<p>

3.	Calculate the injector proportional rate. The concentration of fertilizer on a volume basis is 573 ppm (.00057), a ratio of 1:1745. This is a problem because most proportional injectors have a range of 1:500 to 1:50.<p>

4.	Dilute the fertilizer by four so the fertilizer plus water mixture should be injected at 2,292  ppm, which is 1:436.<p>

5)	Turn on the proportional injector 6.25 hr each week.<p>

<h3>VENTURI FLOW METER</h3>

For a venturi flow meter, select an injector that will inject 1.0 gal/hr or greater. The venturi flow meters have an adjustable valve to decrease the flow rate. If the irrigation system flow and pressure are constant, then the venturi injector rate will be constant for a given fertilizer density. The best way to set a venturi is by installing the inlet tube in a graduate cylinder and measuring the injection rate by timing the rate at which the graduate cylinder empties, then adjust the injector intake valve to achieve the proper flow rate.<p>

<h1>Leaching Requirements of Pecan and Fruit Trees</h1>
<h2>Guide H-644</h2>
<h3>Ted Sammis, Water Specialist<br>
Esteban Herrera, Horticulture Specialist</h3>

Irrigation water contains dissolved salts that can accumulate in the root zone as evapotranspiration (<i>Et</i>) removes irrigation water and leaves the salts behind. As excess quantities of soluble salt accumulate in the root zone, trees have difficulty in extracting water from the salty soil water solution, and transpiration and the resulting growth are reduced.<p>
Excessive salinity build-up can be controlled by applying an additional amount of irrigation water often referred to as the "leaching requirement."<p>

<h3>THE LEACHING REQUIREMENT</h3>

The leaching requirement (<i>LR</i>) is the extra water needed for leaching expressed as a fraction or percentage (leaching percentage) of the total water penetrating the soil (<i>DD</i>). It has been defined by the U.S. Salinity Laboratory as the fraction of the irrigation water (<i>DI</i>) that must penetrate below the root zone to maintain salinity at a specified level.<p>

<pre>					<i>DD
				LR  =  ____
					DI</i>
</pre>

<i>LR </i>varies with the salinity tolerance of the crop and the salinity of the irrigation water. For general use, it is based on quantitative salinity measurements, although leaching requirements for specific salts may also be computed. The sodium content of some irrigation waters may impose serious limitations on its use on certain soils and must be considered in an overall leaching program.<p>
Slow soil permeability, shallow water tables, or restricted subsurface drainages may interfere with adequate leaching. Where these conditions exist, drainage must be improved before soil salinity can be reduced by leaching. In fact, poor drainage often causes excessive accumulations of salt in soil even when relatively good-quality water is used.<p>

<h3>THE LR EQUATION</h3>

<i>LR </i>can also be calculated by dividing the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water (<i>ECiw</i>) by the electrical conductivity of water draining from the bottom of the root zone (<i>FCdw</i>). In practice, the <i>ECdw </i>value is not readily available, and the U.S. Salinity Laboratory recommends using the average electrical conductivity of the soil solution extract (<i>ECe</i>) and the <i>ECiw</i> to determine <i>LR</i>.<p>

<pre>				     ECiw
			LR  =  ________________
				5(ECe) - EC iw
</pre>

Fig. 1 shows the relationship between the salinity of the applied water and the salinity of the soil water saturation extract for different <i>LR</i>s.<p>

(NOTE:  Figure 1 not available.  Please PDF file or contact NMSU Agricultural Communications for a hard copy.)<p>

Growth reduction does not occur in a tree until a threshold level of salinity is reached, and then growth decreases in a linear amount with increasing salinity. Relative growth rate (RGR) reduction for selected soil salinity levels in trees is presented in table 1.<p>

<h3>APPLYING THE LR CONCEPT</h3>

To compute the <i>LR</i>, the salinity of the irrigation water and the salinity tolerance of the crop must be known. These values are furnished by the NMSU Cooperative Extension Service Soil and Water Testing Laboratory as <i>EC</i> x 10 (6th power). These values should be divided by 1,000 to be equivalent units, with values for <i>ECe</i> normally given as <i>EC</i> x 10 (3rd power) (table 1).<p>
<i>Example:</i> To grow pecans irrigated with well water with an electrical conductivity of 1,700 x 10 (-6th power) mhos:<p>
<pre>		<i>EC</i> x 10 (6th power) of irrigation water = 1,700.

To convert to

						1,700
		<i>ECiw</i> x 10 (3rd power)   =     ________
						1,000

					=  1.7 irrigation water

		<i>EC</i> x 10 (3rd power)	=  2.0 soil (from table 1).

</pre>

From fig. 1,  the leaching fraction should be 0.2. Therefore, in addition to the water supplied for consumptive use (<i>Et</i>) (the amount of water absorbed by the plants and lost by evaporation), an additional amount equal to 0.2 <i>Et</i> should be applied for leaching.<p>
Assuming uniform water application, if the irrigation efficiency (the water stored in the root zone divided by the applied water) is greater than (1 - <i>LR</i>), then the <i>LR</i> should be used to calculate depth of irrigation water. If the application efficiency is less than (1 - <i>LR</i>), then the <i>LR</i> is already being satisfied.<p>
Assuming an irrigation efficiency greater than (1 - <i>LR</i>), the depth of irrigation water (<i>Diw</i>) to maintain a steady-state salt balance is<p>

<pre>				<i>Et - Dr
			Diw</i> =  _________,
				1 - <i>LR</i>
</pre>

where <i>Dr</i> is runoff of applied irrigation water. It is assumed that all of the <i>LR</i> will be satisfied by irrigation water exclusive of any leaching by rainfall. If the value of <i>Dr</i> is assumed to be 0 and the intended <i>Et</i> for this irrigation is 3.0", then the depth of irrigation water is<p>

<pre>			3.75" = (3.0 - 0) / (1 - 0.2)
</pre>
This amount of water must be applied to the portion of the field receiving the smallest water application amount so that the <i>LR</i> over the rest of the field is 0.2 or more.<p>

<h1>Pecan Diseases and Their Control</h1>
<h3>Guide H-645<br>

The pecan is well adapted as a commercial crop or an ornamental shade tree in southern New Mexico. Relatively few parasitic disease organisms are a problem because of dry atmospheric conditions during the growing season. There are some disease problems, however, that can cause extensive losses to pecan growers and home gardeners.<p>

<h3>Abiotic Diseases<br>
(caused by non-living factors)</h3>
<h4>Freeze Injury</h4>

Freeze injury causes more pecan tree losses in New Mexico than all other diseases combined. Most losses occur in newly planted orchards; however, older trees also can be affected by freezing temperatures.<p>

Injury has resulted from early winter freezes, such as the ones that occurred in November 1976 and October 1992; extreme mid-winter freezes (January 1978); and late spring freezes. Severe tree losses resulted from the November 1976 freeze, which occurred before trees had properly hardened off during the fall.<p>

<i>Symptoms</i>. Limb die-back is the most noticeable symptom of freeze injury. Splits, cracks, cankers on the bark, and entry of various borers into the bark are also symptoms. Young trees may not leaf out in the spring, but may produce an abundance of sucker growth from below the ground level. Young trees injured in the spring may bleed severely when sap starts to flow. Damage to the trunk and larger branches may be much more severe on the southwest (sunny) side of the tree where sap started to flow during warm periods in the winter.<p>

About a year after a severe freeze has occurred, light-colored bark can often be seen, particularly around bud scars and below branches. Growers should cut into these off-colored areas with a sharp knife. If the bark and tissue below (cambium and xylem) is dead, this is good evidence that severe injury has occurred.<p>

Injury from a freeze may not be evident until two, three, or even four years after a severe freeze has occurred. This type of injury is "subtle injury," and may be more noticeable in a tree that produces a heavy nut crop two or three years after a freeze. Usually the nuts do not mature, and most of them may become sticktights (see explanation of sticktights on page 3).<p>

Occasionally, numerous fruiting structures of the fungus <i>Cytospora</i> sp. will grow on the bark of trees affected by freeze injury. The fungus appears as pinhead-sized bumps that produce masses of orange spores following wet, humid periods. No special controls are needed for this fungus. (See prevention of freeze injury, below.)<p>

<i>Prevention of Freeze Injury</i>. If possible, avoid planting highly freeze-susceptible trees such as 'Wichita'.<p>

Stimulate rapid spring growth by providing adequate nutrients (especially nitrogen and zinc) and water, but do not stimulate late fall growth with late fertilizer application. Apply all nitrogen fertilizers before July 1. It is best to try to encourage early dormancy in pecan trees, especially in young orchards planted with 'Wichita' trees. Stop irrigation in late September, unless the temperatures in October remain high.<p>

Paint the southwest side of trunks and larger limbs of young trees with white latex paint or whitewash. Other measures include wrapping trunks with burlap strips, aluminum foil, or other products. It is important to keep bark tissue in a dormant condition during the winter and early spring. If these protective measures are not taken, sap will start to flow on the southwest side of the tree where the sun has heated the trunk and severe freeze injury can result.<p>

Additionally, freeze injury can be minimized by applying one or two heavy irrigations during December and January.<p>

<i>Care of Winter-Injured Trees</i>. Prune all suckers except one on young trees that have been killed to the ground. This sprout can be used later for re-budding.<p>

Severely prune trees that have extensive injury. Where subtle injury has occurred, growers should prune out dead and weak limbs as they appear. This recovery may take two or more years. In the spring after the last freeze, water and fertilize trees to stimulate new growth.<p>

<h4>Mouse Ear</h4>
Mouse ear is another problem caused by freeze injury. Leaves of affected trees are smaller than normal, rounded on the ends to the shape of a mouse's ear. These symptoms were present on many young trees in the spring of 1977 following the severe freeze in November 1976. Examine trees with mouse ear symptoms for evidence of freeze injury, and prune severely affected branches.<p>

Molybdenum deficiency, though not reported in New Mexico, can present similar symptoms.<p>

<h4>Zinc Deficiency</h4>
Zinc deficiency, commonly called "rosette," is a prevalent nutritional problem of pecans in New Mexico. Zinc is an essential nutrient for growth in plants, but is needed in low quantities compared to other essential nutrients. For example, pecan trees usually need 25,000 ppm nitrogen, but only 50 ppm zinc. Zinc is needed to produce hormones that allow for cell enlargement in stems and leaves.<p>

If zinc is not readily available to the tree, leaves become small, chlorotic, and misshapen. Under an extreme deficiency, yield and nut quality are reduced. Zinc deficiency symptoms usually are first noticed the second or third year after planting a new tree. The first symptom is small, narrow leaves that are yellowed and mottled. Reddish-brown areas often appear between the veins on older leaves. Internodes (the distance between nodes on the stem) become shortened, and an excess of smaller branches is formed, giving the foliage a rosette appearance. In the final stages of the disease, the shoots die back from the tips. Usually, the die-back is confined to the current year's growth, but it sometimes extends to older, larger branches.<p>

Zinc is usually adequate in New Mexico soils, but it becomes unavailable in alkaline soil conditions (high pH) so tree roots cannot absorb enough of the element. This condition is usually more severe in sandy soils and soils that contain high phosphorus levels.<p>

<i>Treatment of Zinc Deficient Trees</i>. Trees with a history of zinc deficiency, trees with obvious zinc deficiency symptoms, or those shown to be deficient in zinc following a leaf analysis should be treated with zinc. Foliar sprays with various zinc compounds are generally the most successful means of correcting zinc deficient-pecan trees. Because of the prevalence of this problem in New Mexico, yearly foliar applications have become a standard practice for many growers. Apply zinc sprays early in the season as the leaves are developing, then apply sprays weekly until leaf growth is complete. For mature trees, zinc is usually applied at bud break and then once every two weeks until five applications have been applied. Applications on young trees should continue until the end of July.<p>

Zinc also may be applied as a soil treatment; however, the highly alkaline soil conditions prevalent in New Mexico often make this a less efficient application method. Soil applications may be tried on trees with little or no leaves (where absorption of the foliar materials is not possible) or on trees that fail to respond to foliar sprays. Zinc chelates are generally recommended. Soil treatment is most effective when applied in the early spring at the first sign of bud break.<p>

More information regarding zinc and other nutrient requirements for pecans can be found in NMSU <a href = "../ces">Cooperative Extension Service</a> Guide H-602, "Pecan Orchard Fertilization."<p>

<h4>Chlorosis</h4>
The causes of chlorosis (yellow leaves) are numerous. They include zinc deficiency, nitrogen deficiency, iron deficiency (not common in pecans), water-logged soils, freeze injury, root rot, crown gall, and herbicide injury.<p>

When chlorosis is caused by a nutrient deficiency, adequate application of nutrients and water will usually correct the problem. Other control methods include improving soil drainage (see the following explanation under "Root Suffocation") when soils are water logged and control practices for root rot and crown gall. Trees with chlorosis caused by low to moderate freeze or herbicide injury will generally grow out of the problem as the trees begin to recover. Cultural practices such as those listed under "Herbicide Injury" may be useful in attempts to repair chlorosis caused by herbicide damage on more severely affected trees.<p>

<h4>Root Suffocation</h4>
Pecans are not adapted to poor soil drainage, a condition found in many New Mexico growing areas. Poorly drained soils become saturated with water over time and do not have sufficient oxygen for normal tree growth. If not corrected, roots start to rot, trees begin to decline, and the top branches start to die. The soil may turn black and have a putrid odor.<p>

Excessive water applied to trees growing in heavy, clay soils is the most common cause of root suffocation. This problem also can occur in orchards where layers of silt have accumulated around trees after flooding or where additional soil has been applied around trees in orchards that have been re-leveled.<p>

Every effort should be made to correct drainage problems. Trenches dug out from the trunk and refilled with loam soil will promote drainage. Trees that have died back should be pruned to remove weak and dying limbs.<p>

<h4>Premature Nut Drop</h4>
A certain amount of nut drop begins early in the growing season and continues until maturity. The August drop is occasionally quite severe and is of greatest concern to growers. In general, poorly grown trees with low vigor are most likely to drop nuts prematurely. Numerous causes and conditions may explain premature nut drop: insufficient food reserve resulting from excessive production during the previous year; poor pollination; poor nutrition; embryo abortion (causes unknown); poor planting sites (poor soils); excessive soil moisture; drought; heavy pest infestation, particularly infestations of nut casebearer, stinkbug, and leaf-footed plant bugs; shuck necrosis; herbicide injury; and wind storms.<p>

<h4>Shuck Necrosis</h4>
"Shuck necrosis" is a term used to describe abnormal black spotting on shucks. This abnormality begins during the water stage of development and may continue to develop until frost. Two or more spots are usually found on affected shucks and appear at random, but may be more pronounced along the suture. The blackened spots are usually slightly sunken, but not necessarily so. There may be a definite or indefinite border between affected and unaffected shuck tissue. In many cases, the nuts drop prematurely. Nuts that remain on the tree usually do not develop properly and may cause a sticktight condition.<p>

The cause (or causes) of shuck necrosis has not been determined. Many attempts have been made to isolate causal organisms from affected nuts, but no known pathogenic organisms have been identified.<p>

Shuck necrosis should not be confused with normal darkening of shucks along the sutures at the stem end, which begins near the end of the growing season. Likewise, this problem should not be confused with shuck disease and stem-end blight diseases reported from other pecan-growing states.<p>

<h4>Sticktights</h4>
Pecans with shucks that have failed to open properly at the end of the growing season are referred to as sticktights. Sticktights occur primarily as a result of immaturity. Its causes include early freeze; low heat units during the growing season; excessive nitrogen; low zinc levels; excessive water or drought conditions at the end of the growing season; water stress at the end of the season; excessive nut production on individual trees; or freeze injury of trunks and limbs in previous years. Correcting these problems should produce fewer sticktights.<p>

<h4>Herbicide Injury</h4>
Careless herbicide applications often cause severe injury and even death in pecans and other trees. Unfortunately, many chemicals used to kill undesirable weeds affect undesirable and desirable plants alike. The three major types of herbicides that cause injury are contact herbicides, hormone-types, and soil sterilants.<p>

Contact herbicides such as Paraquat&#174; are often used to control weeds within the orchard along borders and ditch banks. Drift on windy days will cause circular, brown areas on leaves. Direct sprays on tree foliage will cause large areas of dead leaves, but injury is usually minimal.<p>

Hormone-type herbicides such as 2,4-D and Round-up&#174; are highly volatile, especially on hot days. These herbicides can cause injury for several miles if they are misapplied and the herbicide gets into wind currents. They can cause injury even at low concentrations. Sprayers previously used to apply herbicides also are a contamination source when they are used later to spray insecticides or fungicides. Compounds such as 2,4-D cause misshapen leaves that are curled, distorted, and twisted. In some cases, leaf and nut drop may result. Temporary injury can occur if trees get only a small dose of the chemical; however, severe limb die-back, chlorosis, and even death are possible if a considerable amount of the chemical is applied. Herbicides such as Round-up&#174; often cause injury when they are applied to weeds around the base of young trees because the herbicides can penetrate the tree bark. Bark wraps with materials such as aluminum foil can be used to reduce this type of injury.<p>

Soil sterilants such as Hyvar X&#174; and Pramitol&#174; have been used to kill weeds in waste areas for several years. Farmers and home gardeners often apply soil sterilants to cope with weeds in driveways, alleyways, farm machinery areas, and waste areas, but they may forget that tree roots can be growing in the treated area. Large trees sometimes have roots several feet past the drip line. Roots can absorb the chemicals as long as two or more years later, when they have grown into a treated area. Symptoms of injury include yellowing of veins, marginal leaf burn, browning, and death of cells between the veins causing white- to silver-colored leaves. Death of entire leaves and branches usually follows. The side of a tree closest to a treated area is usually affected first.<p>

Mitigating the damage to herbicide-affected trees is difficult, if not impossible, in most cases because the chemicals can be active for several years. High-value trees affected by herbicide injury may benefit from watering deeply at frequent intervals, pruning severely, adding large amounts of manure to the soil around the tree, and cutting roots that extend into the treated area. Some herbicides can be deactivated by applying activated charcoal at the rate of 7 lb/1000 ft&#178;.<p>

<h4>Wind Damage</h4>
High winds, especially in March and April, can cause severe leaf injury in newly planted trees. This problem is of special concern in newly planted fields with no protection from nearby trees or buildings. Wind-damaged leaves are usually scorched around the margins. The leaves may be quite puckered and have a ragged appearance.<p>

Limbs broken by high winds should be pruned as quickly as possible.<p>

<h4>Limb Die-Back</h4>
Dying limbs at the ends of branches can be caused by zinc deficiency, winter injury, broken limbs, root suffocation, drought, crown gall, herbicide injury, wind damage, heart rot and wood rot, highly alkaline soils, or mechanical injury to trunk, scaffold limbs, and roots. To control these disorders, refer to other sections in this publication. When the cause cannot be determined, prune affected branches, apply extra water (if overwatering is not the cause), and fertilize to help trees recover.<p>

<br>
<h3>Biotic Diseases<br>
(caused by infectious disease agents)</h3>

<h4>Phymatotrichum Root Rot</h4>
This fungal disease is also called "cotton root rot" or "Texas root rot." It is occasionally a problem in southern New Mexico at elevations below 5000 ft, but it is a problem only in the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico. The fungus requires warm soils that have low organic matter and high calcium salts. It is known to attack 2000 or more species of dicotyledonous (broad-leafed) plants but none of the grasses and other monocotyledonous (monocots) plants are susceptible. If not treated, this disease can become severe on newly developed land that has never been cultivated or on land where the fungus has developed on alfalfa, cotton, or other susceptible crops.<p>

The first symptom is a slight yellowing of the leaves. Growers who have experience with this disease can detect this early symptom two to three weeks before wilting actually occurs. Sudden foliage wilting and drying follow a few days later. These symptoms occur only during the summer and early fall months.<p>

When roots are examined, rotting is quite noticeable. A magnifying lens may reveal delicate strands of the fungus wrapped around diseased roots. A microscopic examination by a plant pathologist is sometimes needed to confirm the disease as Phymatotrichum root rot.<p>

During the summer when high humidity occurs, the fungus can be seen on the ground surface, especially in shady areas. It appears as white mats of cottony fungus material that turn to buff-colored powdery masses of spores within two to three days. The mats may be circular or have an irregular outline, and they are 4--6" or more in diameter. These spore mats indicate the presence of the pathogen; however, the spores produced are not viable, and the mats do not spread the fungus to healthy trees.<p>

<i>Treatment of Diseased Trees</i>. If possible, start treatment when trees first exhibit root rot symptoms, i.e., when slight yellowing symptoms occur. If wilting symptoms occur or if leaves become dry, prune one-half or more of the top growth, or pull all of the leaves from the tree to reduce the transpiration rate.<p>

Treat the soil with sulfur, ammonium sulfate, and manure using the following steps.<p>
<ol>
<li>	Loosen soil around affected trees out to the drip line of the branches.<p>
<li>	Cover ground 2" deep with manure. Other forms of organic matter such as moldy hay can be substituted for manure.<p>
<li>	On the prepared surface, scatter ammonium sulfate or an equivalent at a rate of 1 lb/10 ft&#178;.<p>
<li>	Add the same amount of soil sulfur on top of the ammonium sulfate. A circle 12 ft in diameter (suitable for a tree 6--8" in diameter) would need 11 lb of ammonium sulfate and 11 lb of soil sulfur. Nitrate fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate should not be used where root rot is a problem.<p>
<li>	Apply deep water following treatment and keep the soil moist until trees recover.<p>
</ol>

Some trees may not recover even if this treatment is used. Known root rot areas should be treated annually during March or April.<p>

<i>Treatment at Planting Time to Avoid Root Rot</i>. Disease incidence can be minimized in an orchard by treating each planting hole with manure, soil sulfur, and ammonium sulfate.<p>

<ol>
<li>	Dig a broad and comparatively shallow hole.<p>
<li>	Distribute a generous amount of manure (up to one-fifth of the hole by volume).<p>
<li>	Apply soil sulfur at the rate of 1/4 lb/ft&#179; of the tree hole.<p>
<li>	Apply ammonium sulfate (21% nitrogen) or its equivalent at the rate of 1 oz/ft&#179; of tree hole.<p>
</ol>

A round planting hole 4 ft in diameter and 2.5 ft deep has 30 ft&#179;. It should be treated with 6 ft&#179; of manure, 7.5 lb of sulfur, and 1.75 lb of ammonium sulfate.<p>

To distribute the materials well without the extra labor of mixing them, place them in thin layers alternating with layers of soil.<p>

<ol>
<li>	Place about 2" of manure or organic matter in the hole.<p>
<li>	Scatter two handfuls of sulfur and one of ammonium sulfate over the first layer.<p>
<li>	Cover with 3" of soil, and repeat layers until the hole is filled to 6" from the top.<p>
<li>	Flood the hole to settle the soil.<p>
<li>	Plant when soil is no longer muddy. If time permits, prepare tree holes 30--60 days before planting time.<p>

Water after planting, then water frequently and lightly until trees are well established.<p>

<i>Treatment of Planting Sites Where Trees Have Died from Root Rot.</i> Where trees have died from root rot, before replanting treat sites with a soil fumigant such as Vapam&#174;.<p>

<ol>
<li>	Cultivate the soil thoroughly and keep it moist for a least five days before applying the fumigant.<p>
<li>	Apply Vapam&#174; when soil temperature is 55--90&#176;F. Fall treatment is best.<p>
<li>	Use 1.5 qt/100 ft&#178; of Vapam&#174; for sandy soils and 2 qt/100 ft&#178; for heavy soils. Treat basins 5--10 ft in diameter, depending upon the size of tree that died in the site. (See table 1.)<p>
<li>	Mix required amount of Vapam&#174; with 2--3 gal of water and apply evenly over basin with a sprinkling can.<p>
<li>	Flood basin to set soil to a depth of 4--6 ft; about 3" of water in sandy soils and 6" in heavy soils.<p>
<li>	Cover treated area with a tarp or plastic sheet for five to seven days. After treatment, remove and cultivate soil lightly to allow the gas to escape. Wait at least two weeks after the tarp is removed before replanting.<p>
</ol>

<i>Precautions when using Vapam&#174;</i>: Do not apply within 3 ft of the drip line of living plants, shrubs, or trees. Do not apply to dry soil, which causes Vapam&#174; to be ineffective. Do not let Vapam&#174; touch skin or eyes. Do not breathe fumes. Remove contaminated clothing and wash it. Check current registration before use and follow label directions very carefully.<p>

<h4>Heart Rot and Wood Rot</h4>
Heart rot and wood-rotting fungi enter trees through wounds that have not healed properly. The results of infections through wounds and improper pruning cuts are usually not noticed until trees are several years old. Such trees frequently have large cavities and wounds that have never healed. Woody or fleshy shelf fungi or mushrooms can be seen growing from the bark or wounds of severely damaged trees. Some affected trees may show little effects from heart rots and wood rots for several years. Other trees can become unproductive, die back severely, or die shortly after the disease is discovered.<p>

This disease can usually be avoided by proper pruning and by avoiding unnecessary wounds, particularly at the base of the tree. Prune branches flush with the trunk so callus tissue can form and seal the wound. Never leave short projecting branch stubs next to the trunk, because they rarely heal and continue to provide entrances for wood-rotting fungi. Splintered and injured wood, particularly at the base of trees, should be removed cleanly with a sharp knife or chisel.<p>

Treatment of pruning wounds with a wound dressing has been recommended for years, but the practice is not necessary and can be harmful. Research has shown that wound dressings containing asphalt can retard the healing process. Home gardeners wishing to dress a wound for aesthetic purposes can use outside latex house paint. Some benefit may be derived from swabbing wounds close to the ground with household bleach (Clorox&#174;, Purex&#174;) that has been diluted 1:5 with water.<p>

<h4>Powdery Mildew</h4>
This fungal disease is considered to be of minor importance, but each year a few trees are affected following periods of high humidity and cool summer nights in areas where tree growth is dense. The fungus forms a white powdery growth on the nuts, and in rare cases may be found on the leaves. The white powdery fungus may disappear later, but affected nuts will have a brown russet appearance. Small nuts may result when they are infected early in the growing season, or the shucks may split prematurely and kernels may be shriveled.<p>

Trees should be sprayed with a fungicide when severe infection occurs early in the season. Available fungicides include Benlate&#174;, Topsin M&#174;, Orbit&#174;, and wettable sulfur compounds. Repeat sprays may be needed if the fungus threatens to spread during periods of high humidity. Some fungicides can be mixed with insecticides and nutrient sprays. Be sure to check labels and compatibility charts before mixing. If a compatibility chart is not available, perform a jar test before mixing chemicals in the tank. To perform a jar test, add a small amount of each chemical you want to mix together in a clean glass jar. Shake. If the chemicals coagulate, they are not compatible.<p>

<h4>Sooty Mold</h4>
Sooty mold is a conspicuous black, sooty fungus frequently found on leaves and nuts of pecans. This fungus is not parasitic on plants and can easily be removed by rubbing with a clean cloth. It grows on honeydew produced by insects. The direct damage to plants is minimal; however, severe infestations will reduce the amount of light getting to the leaf surface. Controlling aphids and other insects will help to control sooty mold. Severe infestations can be treated with fungicides such as Benlate&#174;, which reduce fungus growth.<p>

<h4>Crown Gall</h4>
Crown gall is a bacterial disease occasionally found in pecan trees. The disease also appears in many other species, and in more than 40 plant families. The most common symptom is the presence of wart-like growths or tumors on the roots, or more often at the base of the trunk at or just below the soil lines. The galls are usually rounded, with irregular rough surfaces. They can vary in size from pea-size to several inches in diameter. The callus tissue formed at the graft or bud union is sometimes mistaken for crown gall. Many trees affected by crown gall grow poorly and have severe die-back, and eventually die. Other trees may show no effect from infection and live for years.<p>

The bacterium enters plant tissue through wounds caused by cultivation, chewing insects, and nematodes. In nurseries and young orchards, tillage equipment is frequently responsible for injuries that lead to crown gall infection. The bacterium can be passed from diseased to healthy plants by contaminated grafting and pruning tools. It can be carried long distances within root or crown tissue of nursery stock or in a contaminated soil that comes with nursery plants.<p>

Growers should inspect nursery stock carefully upon arrival and reject any plants with suspicious knots or galls. If crown gall is discovered in a few trees in a new orchard, it would be wise to remove them with as much root as possible to prevent the disease organism from spreading to other trees. If the disease is discovered in older trees that are producing well, simply remove any loose galls and discard them or treat them with Gallex&#174;. Replacement trees should not be planted for at least two years in a planting site where diseased trees have been removed. If this practice is not practical, remove infested soil from the planting site, and replace it with "clean" soil.<p>

Growers can help avoid this disease by dipping newly purchased bare-root trees in a Galltrol&#174; solution, a biological control product. Nursery owners can usually avoid the disease by selecting planting and propagation wood from sources free of crown gall. It is also helpful to dip budding knives in a 10% bleach solution after budding each tree. Every effort should be made to avoid wounds of any kind while cultivating an orchard.<p>

<h4>Nematodes</h4>
Plant parasitic nematodes are microscopic worms that feed on the roots of susceptible plants. To date, pecan orchard samplings have not revealed abnormally high numbers of pathogenic species in New Mexico, and no information is available about the effect of moderate levels of nematodes on pecans.<p>

Yield reduction as a result of nematode infestations has not been proven in New Mexico. The use of systemic insecticides such as Temik&#174; in previous years may help explain why nematodes have not become a severe problem, as Temik&#174; has nematicidal activity.<p>

If pecans are planted in sandy soils with a history of root-knot nematode, infestations may cause injury to trees resulting in reduced yield. Isolated examples of such situations have been recently identified, but this is not believed to be a widespread problem.<p>

<h1>Caring for Pecan Trees After Transplanting</H1>
<H2>Guide H-646 / PH 3-420</H2>
<H3>Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</H3>


Over 1,500 acres of pecan trees in New Mexico have been transplanted. While no research has been conducted yet to give recommendations to pecan growers transplanting trees, other information has been developed through growers' experiences.<P>

<H3>First Year</H3>

Trees should be watered immediately after being transplanted. Whitewash or white latex paint, diluted 50%, should be applied all over the tree trunk or at least on the southwest side. Irrigate an area at least 2 ft larger than the root system in diameter. Water at least every week to 10 days the first two months after growth has started. Growers may want to eliminate suckers below 5 ft if Round-Up® is to be sprayed on the orchard floor; otherwise leave all foliage.<P>

Nitrogen should be applied during mid-season of the first year, when trees are growing vigorously. Trees should deplete their stored carbohydrates and may grow weak the second year. Apply 100-150 lb of ammonium sulfate (20-30 N units per ac) in two applications. Two or three zinc sprays that also include minor elements are also recommended. Some growers have noticed some leaf burning with applications of 50 lb of ammonium sulfate (l0 units of N).<P>

It is also possible that pecan trees transplanted after a heavy crop may grow weak and could need nitrogen applications even earlier in the season. In any event, nitrogen applications should be made only after vigorous growth has started on transplanted trees.<P>

Water trees often enough to keep soil moist. Weak trees may develop problems with borers below the point where several branches are growing. The best way to control tree borers is to cut excess limbs to avoid crowded branches.<P>

<H3>Second Year</H3>

Use the same cultural practices as the first year. Some selective pruning may be desirable, especially to choose the central leader. One or two branches should be left from each point of growth unless the tree does not have enough foliage. Head back those branches when growth needs to be encouraged; tip-prune them to keep growth in check. Extend the water area.<P>

Pecan production is expected in most one-year-old branches.<P>

Nitrogen should be increased to 250-300 lb of ammonium sulfate (50-60 units). This should be distributed in 3 applications: March, May, and July.<P>

At least three zinc sprayings are recommended; include minor elements in at least in two applications.<P>

<H3>Third Year</H3>

Oftentimes strong branches take over whenever 5-6 branches come from the same point. If this is not the case, select 1 to 2 branches from each whorl of branches. Head back those branches when growth needs to be encouraged or tip-prune them to keep growth in check and to increase growth of lateral branches.<P>

Production increases substantially in the third year.<P>

Increase nitrogen to 350-400 lb of ammonium sulfate (70-80 units). Spread this amount evenly over 3 applications: March, May, and July.<P>

Four zinc sprayings are recommended (minor elements should be included in two applications).<P>

<H3>Fourth and Fifth Years</H3>

Orchard management practices should be similar to those performed in established orchards. Nitrogen applications should be increased to about 600-750 lb of ammonium sulfate (120-150 units); and increase to about 5 zinc sprayings.<P>

Liquid fertilizer may be an excellent choice for transplanted trees, as the root system will have better contact with the nutrients that are applied. In addition, liquid fertilizers make phosphorus and potassium more available to the (limited) root system of transplanted trees. Watering is by far the most important factor in tree-transplanting success.<P>

Some growers have opted for not doing any branch pruning, and they do not eliminate any branches above 4-1/2 ft. These trees look normal from a distance, but after close inspection tree branches are twisted and tangled with each other. It is not known if branches will develop faster in this way, but it is possible that branch breaking will increase.<P>

<TITLE>Growing Grapes in New Mexico</title>

<h1>Growing Grapes in New Mexico</h1>
<h2>Circular 483</h2>
<h3>Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</h3>
Early American settlers found grapes growing wild along the East Coast and assumed that higher quality European varieties would also grow well where the wild grapes grew. But severe winters, disease, and insects caused the imported <i>Vitis vinifera </i>to fail.<p>
Vinifera grapes require mild, dry climates like those in California, Arizona, southern New Mexico, and west Texas. They may be injured by temperatures below 0öF (-18öC), and their susceptibility to certain diseases and insects restricts their culture to dry climates.<p>
American species (<i>V. labrusca, V. rotundifolia</i>, and others) are winter-hardy and tolerant of many diseases and insects. 'Isabelle', 'Catawba', and 'Concord' were among the first cultivars developed to improve these native grapes. However, American grapes are generally considered inferior to European cultivars for wine and table use.<p>
Through hybridization, the high fruit quality characteristics of the vinifera grapes have been combined with the hardiness and resistance of <i>V. labrusca </i>to develop groups called French and American hybrids. Much of the wine-grape acreage in the East is now planted to cultivars of these groups.<p>
Grape culture in New Mexico dates back to the coming of the early Spanish settlers. The first European grapes were probably grown on the mission grounds. The cultivar 'Mission', a vinifera grape, probably came from these early plantings. European grapes were largely confined to southern areas of the state, as they still are today.<p>
<h3>Soils and Their Preparation</h3>
Many types of soils are used for growing grapes, but they are most successfully grown on sandy or fine sandy loams with average fertility and good drainage. On soils low in fertility, grapes grow slowly and produce low yields; on extremely fertile soils, vines usually grow excessively and the crop matures late. Fine, tight soils that contain much clay are not suitable for grape production.<p>
Regardless of soil type, the drainage must be good. Impervious layers of clay or caliche closer than 4 ft (1.2 m) to the surface may cause poor drainage and salt accumulation.<p>
Unless drip irrigation is to be used, land for a vineyard should be leveled and disked before plants are set. Spacing depends upon the cultivar, the training system, and the type of machinery used in the vineyard. Vinifera grapes trained to the head system are planted 7-9 ft (2.1-2.7 m) apart in the row, in rows 8-12 ft (2.4-3.7 m) apart. The distance between rows depends on the trellis used. In commercial vineyards, adequate space must be provided for roads at the ends and sides of the vineyard, and driveways through the center of the planting, to give ready access for harvesting and cultural operations. Twenty to 25 ft (6.1-7.6 m) is generally adequate for driveways.<p>
In home plantings, grape plants may be spaced closer, provided there is adequate room to prune and thin the grapes and to control insects and disease. A 6- to 8-foot (1.8- to 2.4-meter) spacing is satisfactory when planting grapes for an arbor or along a carport.<p>
<h3>Cultivars (Varieties)</h3>
The general types of grapes grown in New Mexico are vinifera, American (<i>V. labrusca</i>), and hybrids (<i>V. vinifera x V. labrusca</i> and other American species).<p>
Vinifera grapes, also called "wine grapes," have skins that adhere firmly to the pulp. These grapes require mild climates with long, hot, dry growing seasons and moderate winter temperatures. In New Mexico, they should be grown only in the southern and southeastern parts of the state. California grows only vinifera grapes.<p>
American grapes are cold hardy and do well in many areas of northern New Mexico and at higher elevations where vinifera grapes are not well adapted. Berries of <i>V. labrusca</i> have a "foxy" flavor and skins that separate easily from relatively soft, acid pulp. 'Concord', grown in the country's Northeast, is the best known of this group.<p>
Many American grape cultivars become chlorotic in alkaline soils unless grafted to tolerant rootstocks. The hot, dry climate and alkaline soils of southern New Mexico are not conducive to the production of most American grape cultivars.<p>
Commercial grape juice, grape concentrate, and grape jelly come almost exclusively from American grapes. Some American cultivars are sold as table or dessert grapes, and some are seedless. Certain American grapes are used for making varietal wines, but usually they are blended with <i>V. vinifera</i>. Most <i>V. labrusca</i> grapes contain too much acid and tannin and too little sugar for high quality wines. However, new varieties developed in the eastern states, such as 'Cayuga White', show promise for making good quality wines.<p>
The third group of grapes grown in New Mexico are hybrids of the American and European cultivars. American hybrids are generally considered to be crosses between the cultivated American-type grape having some inheritance of <i>V. labrusca </i>and the vinifera grape. French hybrids are crosses between the wild American grape (primarily <i>V. rupestris</i> and <i>V. lincecumii</i>) and the European species (<i>V. vinifera</i>). French hybrids and American hybrids combine some of the cold hardiness and disease resistance of <i>V. labrusca </i>with the high fruit quality of <i>V. vinifera</i>. Some of these hybrids may be grown in areas not adapted to vinifera production, such as northern New Mexico. French hybrids are generally used for making wine, but some are good for juice or table use.<p>

<h3>Planting the Vineyard</h3>
Order plants a year ahead of planting, to be sure of obtaining the cultivars you want. Request delivery for January or February. Get virus-free plants, if possible.<p>
If the young vines are to be planted immediately upon arrival, unpack them and keep the roots damp until they are set. If planting is to be delayed, bury the plants in a furrow deep and wide enough to hold the roots and most of the upper portion; keep them moist. A wet burlap sack placed over the tops aids in preventing growth in the event of warm temperatures.<p>
At planting, prune vines to one cane with two buds. Set the plants slightly deeper than they grew in the nursery, in holes wide enough to hold the roots without crowding. Pack soil slightly and apply 2-4 gal (7.6-15.1 l) of water per plant.<p>
<h3>Training and Pruning</h3>
In training a young vine, the grower wants to develop a single strong shoot with several well-placed laterals to form a permanent framework. Some of the vine's crop potential during early years is sacrificed to obtain a strong, well-shaped vine as inexpensively and as early as possible.<p>
After young vines have been pruned at planting, they are not pruned again until the following spring. Just before growth begins the second year, select the strongest cane and tie it to a stake to form a straight trunk. Remove all other canes.<p>
From this point, training depends upon the system you select. Three of the most common are the head, cordon, and cane (four-arm Kniffin is one example of a cane system).<p>
<i>Head System</i>. This system is designed primarily for vinifera and a few hybrid cultivars.<p>
Set a post 2" x 2" or larger (5 cm x 5 cm) beside the vine. The post should be 30-36" (76-91 cm) above the ground. If the selected cane seems weak the second spring, cut it back to two buds. If it is vigorous, do not cut it back. Tie the cane and the future shoot that is to form the trunk to the post. Remove all lateral shoots. When the shoot is within 6" (15 cm) of the top of the post, cut off the terminal to encourage laterals to form the head.<p>
The third spring, prune the canes back to short spurs with two to five buds. Each succeeding spring, repeat this pruning procedure. As the head develops, you will have to cut out some spurs to prevent overproduction.<p>
<i>Cordon System</i>. This system is also designed for vinifera and hybrid cultivars. It requires a two-wire trellis, with the lower wire 20-40" (51-102 cm) above the ground and an upper wire 14" (36 cm) above the lower one to support the shoots. In vineyards under drip irrigation, an extra wire is usually placed below the first trellis wire to support the drip irrigation line.<p>
In the second spring, train the vines as you would for the head system, except head back the cane or shoot when it reaches the lower wire. Select two laterals and train them along the lower wire. The third spring, head the two canes back to about five buds each. These form the permanent arms of the cordon and should be gradually extended to a length of 18-24" (46-61 cm) each. Each spring, prune the canes or shoots that grow from the cordon back to two buds each. Remove all growth from the underside of each cordon. About five upright shoots (two buds each) should be allowed to grow on each permanent arm.<p>
<i>Cane System</i>. The four-arm Kniffin is a good cane system used for American varieties, most hybrids, and vinifera cultivars such as 'Thompson Seedless' and 'Black Monukka'. Install a two-wire trellis, with the lower wire 3-3.5 ft (90-107 cm) above the ground and the upper wire 5-7 ft (1.5-2.1 m) above the ground.<p>
At the beginning of the second spring, tie the cane or shoot to a stake. When the shoot reaches the lower wire, head it back to force laterals. Train two of these, one on each side of the vine, along the wire.<p>
Select an upright shoot and tie it to the stake above the lower wire. When it reaches the upper wire, head it back to force two laterals and train them along the upper wire. Weak varieties may require two years to reach the upper wire.<p>
In the third spring, shorten the four canes (arms) to four to six buds each. Avoid heavy production at this time by leaving fewer buds or by removing some flowers.<p>
In the fourth spring, select one cane growing from each of the four arms and tie these along the wires. Shorten these canes to seven to eight buds each. A strong vine could produce mature fruit from four eight-bud canes.<p>
Remove all other canes from the vine except one arising from each arm. Shorten these to spurs of one or two buds each. These renewal spurs produce canes for next year's crop. Each spring thereafter, remove the old fruiting canes and all other growth except one cane and one renewal spur from each arm.<p>
<h3>Fertilizers</h3>
Grapes are slow to show the effects of fertilizer deficiencies, but lack of fertilizer over a period of years results in gradual declines in growth and yield. Strong vine growth and healthy, dark green foliage are essential for heavy production. <i>When </i>a vine grows is as important as <i>how much </i>it grows. Excessive growth during late summer and fall keeps both fruit and wood from ripening properly.<p>
Nitrogen is the fertilizer needed most commonly in New Mexico vineyards. Do not apply nitrogen fertilizer during the same year grapevines are planted. After the second year, about 30-50 lb of nitrogen per acre (150-250 lb of ammonium sulfate) is recommended for vineyards. Very light sandy soils may require more, and plants in fertile and heavier soils may show no response to fertilizer. Apply fertilizer during the winter or very early spring. Do not apply nitrogen fertilizer after June 30.<p>
Phosphorus fertilizer should be incorporated into the soil before planting. Although not much research has been conducted in this matter, it is thought that about 50 lb of phosphorus per acre is needed. Annual applications of monoammonium phosphate (MAP) have been successful with fruit trees. Applications of 50 lb of phosphorus (in MAP form) in alternate years may be helpful in those vineyards showing weak growth and low production.<p>
Potassium levels are usually adequate in New Mexico soils with the exception of sandy soils. Whenever soil analysis shows low amounts of this element, approximately 50-100 lb of potassium per acre should be incorporated every other year. The right quantity has not yet been determined through research.<p>
Barnyard manure supplies organic matter, which aids in maintaining good physical soil condition, and provides some nitrogen. Apply it in the winter, at rates from 8-14 tons per acre (16-28 metric tons per hectare). Annual applications of the higher rates are not usually necessary on heavier soils. Heavy applications of manure may increase zinc and iron deficiencies in American grapes and in the French hybrids. Interveinal yellowing is the symptom for iron deficiency.<p>
Chlorosis often becomes a problem with American and French hybrids growing in soils high in caliche or other forms of calcium. The best method of controlling iron and zinc deficiencies in these soils is to plant vines grafted on tolerant rootstocks, such as 'Solonis' x 'Othelo', '11613', 'Dogridge', and 'Saltcreek'. Chlorosis is seldom a problem with vinifera grapes. Soil applications of iron sulfate are not effective in limestone soils. Iron chelates should be used when iron is incorporated into the vineyard. Foliar applications of iron chelate at two- to four-week intervals, beginning soon after fruit set, may be necessary to control chlorosis. Iron chelate is compatible with most insecticides used in controlling grape insects and can be applied simultaneously with them, or it can be supplied through he drip irrigation system.<p>
<h3>Irrigation</h3>
The amount of water and frequency of application necessary to meet the needs of grapevines grown in different soil types vary considerably. Available soil moisture must always be present in the root zone during the growing season, especially when the most rapid growth of the berries occurs. Young vines must be watered more frequently than older vines, particularly during the first year.<p>
Bearing vines grow rapidly in spring and early summer, putting on a succulent type of growth. Normally, a gradual slowing of shoot growth occurs as the berries enlarge. Growth rate continues to slow and almost stops as the fruit begins to ripen.<p>
A shortage of available soil moisture greatly reduces the normal growth rate of a grapevine. A further reduction in moisture supply may be detected by the appearance of a soft, yellowish green color in the terminal leaves. Grapevines are quite tolerant to drought, but when heavily stressed, the soft-green color at the terminals turns to grey-green, and plant growth almost stops.<p>
Grapes grown on medium to heavy soils normally require 20-30" (51-76 cm) of irrigation water per season. In lighter sandy soils, 3-4 ft (91-122 cm) of water may be needed to produce satisfactory crops and to provide for normal growth. Drip irrigation, used extensively in New Mexico vineyards, will help achieve efficient water use.<p>
The grape is a deep-rooted plant, therefore, apply a heavy irrigation in winter and in early spring just before growth starts, to wet the soil to a depth of 6-8 ft (1.8-2.4 m). The young developing shoots, leaves, and fruit require little additional water during April and May. As the leaf area increases and the berries begin to enlarge, maintain available moisture throughout the root zone. Tensiometers are useful aids in determining soil moisture and water penetration.<p>
<h3>Winter Injury</h3>
Injury to grapevines during the winter may be a problem in all areas of New Mexico. Hardening the vines is very important in reducing injury. Lengthen the interval between irrigations in late summer and fall. This reduces vegetative growth and allows the wood to mature. If vines are overly vigorous, reduce the rate of nitrogen fertilizers.<p>
Overcropping vines reduces the accumulation of carbohydrates, which is necessary for vine hardening. Proper pruning methods will help regulate the crop, however, it may be necessary to further reduce the crop by thinning clusters.<p>
Injury from late spring frosts may be reduced by delaying pruning in the spring. Most of the pruning may be done early, but delaying the shortening of canes and spurs will retard bud break so the shoots may escape frost injury.<p>
In areas subject to frequent injury from cold, training vines to two trunks may be advantageous. Frequently one of the two trunks will survive, so the entire vine is not lost.<p>
<h3>Weed Control</h3>
Cultivate the vineyard only to control weeds, incorporate cover crops and manures, or increase water penetration into the soil. Cultivating should be shallow and done with flat cultivators, a disk, or a rototiller. Deep cultivation is never recommended.<p>
Keep the vineyard clean from early spring until midsummer, especially if it is young. Weeds and grass, which compete with young vines for moisture and nutrients, should not be permitted to grow within a 2-foot (61-cm) radius of vines less than three years old. A tractor-mounted french plow or grape hoe can greatly reduce the amount of hand-weeding.<p>
Low organic matter content of New Mexico soils restricts the use of herbicides. Follow label instructions carefully.<p>
After grapes are harvested, leave weeds to help hold the soil during windy winter months. Winter cover crops of barley, rye, or wheat may be grown to control erosion and add organic matter to soils. Sour clover, burr clover, and oats also may be grown in southern New Mexico. Turn under cover crops early in the spring.<p>
<h3>Grape Insects</h3>
Since recommendations for grape insect control are subjected to frequent change, chemical control measures are not given here. Ask your county Extension agent for the most recent recommendations.<p>
The <i>grape leafhopper </i>is the most common insect pest of grapes in New Mexico. These tiny insects are narrow and less than 1/8" (1/4 cm) long. The adults are yellow with red and black markings on their wings. They spend the winter as adults in weedy, grassy areas near the vineyard and move into the vines as soon as growth begins. Eggs, which are laid in the leaves, hatch in about two weeks. The pale wingless nymphs (immature stage) feed on the lower surface of the leaves, casting skins five times before becoming adults. It takes three or four weeks for the young to reach the adult stage.<p>
Occasionally, the <i>western grape-leaf skeletonizer </i>becomes a problem, especially in small backyard or home vineyards. In the larva or worm stage, this insect is black and yellow (six-banded) and feeds only on the underside of the leaves. It eats the cells and leaves, but not even the smallest veins, creating a skeleton effect.<p>
When applying an insecticide, apply the material on leaf portions where insects are feeding.<p>
Other insects that sometimes infest grape plants are grasshoppers, June beetles, flea beetles, and spider mites.<p>
<h3>Disorders and Diseases of Grapes</h3>
<i>Chlorosis </i>in grapes, particularly American varieties, is most frequently the result of iron deficiency in the plant. Excess calcium in the soil makes the iron unavailable to the plants. In some areas of New Mexico, there also is an actual iron deficiency in the soil.<p>
Iron deficiency causes the leaves to turn yellow, while the veins and mid-ribs remain a normal green color. The yellow color of the leaves is due to a lack of chlorophyll, the green coloring matter important to the formation of plant sugars. Lack of chlorophyll, if left unremedied, decreases yield, reduces the sugar content of the fruit, and eventually kills the vine.<p>
Iron chelate, applied to vines twice during the growing season as a side-dressing, usually corrects the deficiency in good soil. Soil applications of iron may not completely control chlorosis where vines are growing in soils high in caliche or other forms of limestone. Supplemental foliar sprays of iron chelate at 2 lb per 100 gal (.91 kg per 378 l) of water may be necessary.<p>
<i>Little-leaf </i>may become a problem if the soil is highly alkaline or contains an excessive amount of calcium or organic matter. Grapevines affected with this disorder, a result of zinc deficiency, have stunted leaves. The first leaf formed on the shoot is usually normal or only slightly yellow. The yellowing becomes more severe as the shoot develops. The leaves at the base of the canes are green while those farther out on the shoot are smaller and more chlorotic. The tissue close to the veins is the greenest, with whitish or yellowish green areas between the veins.<p>
Yields may be reduced on vines that are only slightly affected; badly affected vines may produce very low yields or none at all. Sometimes chlorotic vines thought to be deficient of iron may actually be suffering from a deficiency of zinc, or a combination of both. This is probable when vinifera becomes chlorotic.<p>
The most economical way to supply needed zinc is to daub pruning cuts with a zinc sulfate solution. Apply 1 lb of zinc sulfate, dissolved in 1 gal of water (.45 kg in 7.6 l), to pruning cuts within two hours after pruning. Zinc foliar sprays are effective, but only if applied no later than two weeks before bloom.<p>
<i>Powdery mildew </i>is a fungus disease prevalent on vinifera grapes. Any portion of the plant—leaves, blossoms, fruit, and young shoots—may be affected. White patches that create the appearance of having been dusted with flour may be noted on leaves and young shoots; blossoms fail to set fruit. Young berries attacked by this fungus may drop or become hardened, discolored, and cracked. Dark blotches on shoots can be noticed during the winter on plants affected by powdery mildew during the season.<p>
To control powdery mildew, start to apply fungicides at bud break in vineyards where symptoms appeared the year before. Sulfur protects vines from infections, but it may have little effect on established infections. Heavy sulfuring during high temperatures may burn the foliage and berries. Systemic fungicides like BayletonÆ are the best. For recommendations, ask your county Extension agent.<p>
<i>Root knot </i>caused by a gall-forming nematode may become a problem in sandy and sandy loam soils, resulting in a decline in vine vigor and a reduction in yields. When planting new vineyards in nematode-infected soil, use resistant rootstocks. In loam and clay loam soils, root knot is usually not a problem.<p>
In established vineyards with moderate root-knot infestations, effects of the disorder may be somewhat offset by more frequent irrigations during the main growing and fruit maturation seasons. Soil fumigation may become necessary.<p>
<i>Black rot </i>is seldom a serious disease in New Mexico, but it may become troublesome during seasons of frequent rains and high humidity. The symptoms of black rot are most conspicuous on the fruit and leaves. The leaf develops reddish brown spots, and immature berries develop brown spots that soon cover the entire berry, causing it to shrivel and mummify.<p>
Turn under or remove all mummified fruit and leaves from the ground and vines in late winter or early spring. Prebloom applications of fungicides are recommended where infections have been heavy.<p>
<i>Crown gall</i>, also known as black knot when it occurs on the aerial parts of grapevines, is caused by the bacterium <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>. Gall formation is first seen as small outgrowths on roots, crowns, and sometimes on canes and stem tissue. Galls may grow to several inches in diameter and are composed of soft, disorganized tissue. Crown gall may be controlled in several ways, but good sanitation and avoiding injuries are very important. More important still is to buy nursery stock from a reliable nursery to insure infested grapevines are not included along with healthy ones.<p>
<i>Nematodes </i>are microscopic, multicellular, nonsegmented roundworms commonly present in soils. Roots of nematode-infested vines are unable to meet above-ground demands for nutrients and water. Vine damage is eventually manifested as reduced vigor and yield, with slight yellowing of leaves. Vine death seldom occurs unless there are other stresses on the plant. Root knot nematodes, dagger nematodes, and ring nematodes are the most common in vineyards. Plant parasitic nematodes are concentrated where feeder roots are most abundant. Therefore, when there is fear of nematode presence in the vineyard, sample both soil and roots in the berm area 12-18" from the vine trunk to a depth of 30". Variety and rootstock selection also can minimize damage by nematodes, especially root knot nematode. 'Salt Creek', 'Dogridge', '1613 Harmony', and 'Freedom' rootstocks are reported to have tolerance or resistance to root knot nematode. The same is true for the commercial varieties, 'Thompson Seedless', 'Perlette', 'Zinfandel', 'Barbera', and 'Emperor'.<p>

To manage pecan orchards efficiently, growers need an annual plan of work. Planning can help growers and managers address immediate problems and prepare for work that will be needed later in the season.<p>

The schedules in this guide will help New Mexico pecan growers and orchard managers make annual, monthly, and weekly plans. Use these schedules together with orchard records (for example, information on fertilization, water management, harvest dates, and pecan production) to make plans appropriate for the orchard.<p>

The table below provides an overview of orchard operations for a whole year. Following the table, month-by-month schedules cover orchard operations for new, young (2-8 years), and established (9 years or more) orchards.<p>

<h2>Greenhouse Vegetable Production</h2>

Greenhouse vegetable production has traditionally been located near population centers, primarily in the northeastern United States. Improved transportation and high energy costs have forced the industry south. With light being one of the most important factors in greenhouse vegetable production, the Southwest has become an ideal area for future development of this industry, particularly in the winter months when tomato and cucumber prices are at a premium.<p>

<h2>Location of Greenhouse</h2>

The ideal location for a greenhouse has high winter light intensity, moderate winter temperatures, low humidity, and easy access to markets. The easy availability of existing utilities will help reduce establishment costs and will affect ongoing fuel costs. Avoid trees or buildings that may shade the greenhouse, although windbreaks will help reduce heating costs if properly located. Be sure to leave sufficient room for future expansion and parking.<p>

While superhighways have made transporting greenhouse-grown vegetables easier, locating greenhouse-grown tomatoes near large population areas is still important. High quality tomatoes should be vine ripened; as ripe tomatoes are hard to transport, the closer they are to the retail market the better.<p>

Greenhouses using native soil for vegetable production should be constructed on level sites with deep, well-drained soils. Sandy loams are best. A source of good quality water also is important. High salt concentrations in either the soil or water can significantly reduce yields. Where soils are not suitable, growers may consider bringing in a better soil or using a soil-less production system.<p>

<h2>Greenhouse Construction</h2>

When considering greenhouse designs, three major factors should be considered: load limitations, light penetration, and cost. The primary load considerations include snow and wind. Roof slopes of at least 28&#176; and heated air in the greenhouse should prevent snow accumulation on the roof. Bracing along sides of the greenhouse and roof should be sufficient to withstand wind, particularly in the spring. Bracing along the roof also should be sufficient to withstand crop loads if tomato or cucumber vines are to be supported by twine attached to the bracing. A concrete footing is preferred for a permanent greenhouse. A wide door at one end of the greenhouse will ensure easy access for equipment.<p>

Without sacrificing strength, support structures should be kept to a minimum to maximize light penetration. Glazing materials should be highly transparent. Overhead electrical lines, irrigation systems, and heating ducts should be kept to a minimum. Support structures should be painted with a reflective, light-colored material for maximum light reflection.<p>

Most greenhouse crops grow best in light whose wavelengths range from 400 to 700 nanometers. This range of wavelengths is called <i>photosynthetically active radiation </i>(PAR). Most greenhouse coverings will accommodate these short waves of visible light. Polyethylene and fiberglass tend to scatter light, while acrylic and polycarbonate tend to allow radiation to pass through directly. Scattered or diffused light tends to benefit plants by reducing excess light on upper leaves and increasing reflected light to lower leaves.<p>

Plastic glazed greenhouses have several advantages over glass greenhouses, the main advantage being cost. Plastic also is adapted to various greenhouse designs, generally resistant to breakage, lightweight, and relatively easy to apply.<p>

<h3>Types of Plastic Coverings</h3>
<ul>
<li>	<b>Acrylic</b> is resistant to weathering and breakage and is very transparent. Its ultra-violet radiation absorption rate is higher than glass. Double-layer acrylic transmits about 83 percent of light and reduces heat loss 20&#045;40 percent over single-layer. This material does not yellow. Its disadvantages are that it is flammable, very expensive, and easily scratched.<p>

<li>	<b>Polycarbonate</b> resists impact better and is more flexible, thinner, and less expensive than acrylic. Double-layer polycarbonate transmits about 75-80 percent of light and reduces heat loss 40 percent over single-layer. This material scratches easily, has a high expansion/contraction rate, and starts turning yellow and losing transparency within a year (although new varieties with UV inhibitors don't yellow as quickly).<p>

<li>	<b>Fiberglass</b> reinforced polyester (FRP) panels are durable, attractive, and moderately priced. Compared to glass, FRP panels are more resistant to impact, transmit slightly less light, and weathering over time reduces light transmission. This plastic is easy to cut and comes in corrugated or flat panels. It provides superior weatherability only when coated with Tedlar. Fiberglass has a high expansion/contraction rate.<p>

<li>	<b>Polyethylene film</b> is inexpensive but temporary, less attractive, and requires more maintenance than other plastics. It is easily destroyed by ultraviolet radiation (UV) from the sun, although film treated with UV inhibitors will last 12-24 months longer than untreated. Because it comes in wider sheets it requires fewer structural framing members for support, resulting in greater light transmission. Using a double layer of 6 mil polyethylene on the outside and 2 mil as an inner barrier will help conserve heat; this inner layer also will help reduce water condensation. The inner layer should be 1-4 inches from the outside layer with layers kept separated by a small fan (creating an insulating dead air space) or wood spacers. Two layers reduce heat loss 30-40 percent and transmit 75-87 percent of available light when new.<p>

<li>	<b>Polyvinyl chloride film</b> has very high emissivity for long-wave radiation, which creates slightly higher air temperatures in the greenhouse at night. UV inhibitors can increase the life of the film. It is more expensive than polyethylene film and tends to accumulate dirt, which must be washed off in winter for better light transmission.<p>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Temperature Control</h2>

Regulating air temperature in the greenhouse is important for both vegetative growth and fruiting. To determine heating requirements, it is essential to know the minimum temperature requirements for the crop, the lowest outdoor temperature that might be expected, and the surface area of the greenhouse. Heat loss also will be affected by wind and site exposure.<p>

Most vegetable production greenhouses in New Mexico are heated by natural gas. Forced-air heaters installed in the ridge area of the greenhouse will take up a minimum of space. It is important to install a heater with sufficient BTU output to heat the greenhouse on the coldest day. Natural and compressed gas heaters should be vented for safety and to prevent crop damage. Thermostats should be located at plant level where plants are growing and where drafts or sunlight do not directly affect them.<p>

Greenhouse cooling also is important. Evaporative cooling is the most efficient and economical way to reduce greenhouse temperatures in New Mexico. Proper ventilation also is important not only for temperature control, but also to replenish carbon dioxide and control relative humidity. Relative humidities above 90 percent will encourage disease problems. Roof ventilators are seldom used on plastic houses, which instead use side vents to provide both ventilation and cooling. Vents should be installed as high on the wall as possible. Shading may be required in the late spring or early fall if daytime temperatures become too high. Various shading materials that can be sprayed or brushed on are available from greenhouse supply companies. However, shade compounds must be removed when cool weather sets in. Shade cloths with various degrees of shading also are available.<p>

Heating, cooling, and ventilation should be automated to save labor and to ensure proper temperature control. Polyethylene ventilation tubes with 3-inch perforation holes along the tube suspended in the peak of the house from one end to the other help evenly mix cooler air with warmer air, preventing drafts.<p>
<br>
<h2>Soil Culture</h2>

The easiest way to get started in greenhouse vegetable production is to use the existing soil on site, but soils must be well drained. Soils can be improved by applying ample quantities of well-rotted livestock manure, compost, or composted livestock manure. Apply all manures before fumigation. Soils should be fumigated or sterilized with steam at least two weeks before planting. If the soil is steamed, maintain a temperature of 180&#176;F for at least four hours. Avoid deep tillage after sterilization to prevent reintroduction of weed seed and disease organisms from below the sterilization or fumigation zone.<p>

A soil test should be taken before planting to determine the amount of fertilizer to apply for each crop. All phosphorous and potassium fertilizers should be applied before planting and incorporated directly into the soil. Nitrogen fertilizers should be applied in split applications, part before planting and the rest as needed during the growing season. Nitrogen fertilizers can be applied as sidedressings or through a drip irrigation system. Secondary and minor fertilizer elements should be applied as needed.<p>
<br>
<h2>Hydroponic Culture</h2>

Hydroponic culture of greenhouse vegetables involves the production of crops in sand, gravel, or artificial soil-less mixes in bags, tubes, tubs, tanks, or troughs designed to allow the circulation of nutrient media needed for crop growth. Unlike conventional soil culture, hydroponic culture of greenhouse vegetables is less forgiving and requires intense management. Although present automation systems can minimize fertilization and irrigation labor inputs, continuous monitoring of the system is important. Growers must be highly knowledgeable about plant growth, nutrient balances, cultural media characteristics, and plant physiology. Nevertheless, hydroponics allows the culture of greenhouse vegetables in areas where soils are not suitable for vegetable production.<p>
<br>
<h2>Crops and Culture</h2>

Tomatoes are the most common vegetables grown in greenhouses, followed by cucumbers. Both are grown in the off-season (fall, winter, and spring) to take advantage of premium prices. Leaf and Bibb lettuces often are grown in the winter in cooler areas of the state. Other popular crops include bell peppers, eggplant, and herbs like basil.<p>
<br>
<h2>Carbon Dioxide Enhancement</h2>

The introduction of supplementary carbon dioxide into the greenhouse has been found to significantly increase the yields of greenhouse tomatoes and other vegetables. Supplementary carbon dioxide is most effective on days when the greenhouse has been shut up for several days with no ventilation. Maximum results can be achieved by injecting 1000-1500 ppm CO<sub>2 </sub>into the greenhouse using propane burners or other CO<sub>2 </sub>generators.<p>
<br>
<h2>Integrated Pest Management</h2>

Integrated pest management (IPM) is a holistic approach to the management of pests. IPM does not exclude the use of pesticides in the greenhouse. Rather, pesticides are used in combination with cultural, natural, mechanical, and biological control as well as insect monitoring to maximize the effectiveness of control methods. Reduced use of pesticides under more effective timing schedules reduces not only the adverse effects of these chemicals on the environment and people, but also reduces the chance of pests developing resistance. For more information on pest control techniques, contact your local county Extension agent.<p>
<br>
<h2>Tomato</h2>

<h3>Planting</h3>
One or two tomato crops can be planted in the greenhouse during the year. Planting, transplanting, and harvest dates will vary depending on location. As most tomato varieties will begin to ripen 100 days after planting, seed should be planted so the fruit begin to ripen soon after first frost for fall crops.<p>

In cooler areas of New Mexico, tomato crops are generally planted in early July and transplanted to greenhouse beds in mid-August. Harvest will begin in October and may continue until early March. Harvesting may be terminated at an earlier date if heating costs become extreme. Late spring harvest can be accomplished by delaying planting until late fall or early winter. Planting dates in southern New Mexico should be delayed until mid-August or later due to hot weather in mid-summer.<p>

Plants are best started in individual containers (plastic pots, peat pots, or cubes) to reduce labor costs and reduce transplanting shock. Use of commercial sterile potting mixes will decrease the incidence of seedling disease problems. Custom soil mixes can be used, but must be pasteurized to eliminate insects, diseases, and weed seed. Heating the moist soil mixture to a temperature of 160&#176;F for 30 minutes will kill most pests.<p>

Sow two to three seeds per pot (1/4-inch deep) and water. Then cover pots with clear polyethylene and place in the shade (70&#176;F) until seedlings emerge. Plastic should then be removed and the pots moved into full sun. Thin the seedlings to one plant per pot.<p>

If possible, seedlings should be grown at daytime temperatures of 58-60&#176;F (nighttime 52-56&#176;F) for the first 10-14 days. This initial cold treatment should help seedlings develop larger cotyledons and thicker stems. Plants should also set more early fruit, increasing both early and total yields. Thereafter a daytime temperature of 70-75&#176;F (nighttime 60-62&#176;F) should be maintained. After the initial cold treatment, temperatures should not fall below 55&#176;F, which may cause rough, irregularly shaped fruit and stunted plant growth. Temperatures can be reduced slightly during cloudy days.<p>

Irrigation water may have to be heated in the winter before use. Water less than 50&#176;F will chill the roots, causing poor growth. Plants should be fertilized weekly with a starter solution (1/2 ounce of 21-53-0 per gallon of water) in the irrigation water. As plants become larger, feeding can be increased to twice a week.<p>

Transplants should be established in the ground beds approximately four to six weeks after seeding. Set transplants in the soil 1 inch deeper than previously grown. Space plants 15-18 inches apart in rows 3-3.5 feet wide. Water immediately after transplanting.<p>

<h3>Training</h3>
Plants should be trained as single (main) stems by removing all side shoots or suckers that develop between leaf petioles and the stems. Remove shoots by snapping them off, not cutting, as diseases can be transmitted on the knife blade. Vines can be supported by plastic or binder twine loosely anchored around the base of the plants (non-slip loop) and to overhead support wires (11- to 12-gauge) running the length of the row. Overhead wires should be at least 7 feet above the surface of the bed and be firmly anchored to support structures.<p>

<img src="vine.gif"width=120 height=293 align=right>
Twine should be wrapped clockwise around the vine as it develops, with one complete swirl every three leaves. The vine should be supported by the twine under the leaves, not the stems of the fruit clusters. Also wrap twine in the same direction, using clips or tape to keep vines from slipping down the twine. Do not try to wrap the twine around the growing tip because the tip may break.<p>

When plants reach overhead supporting wires, untie the twine and lower vines and twine at least 3 feet. After lowering, vines should all lean in one direction in one row. Vines in adjacent rows should lean in the opposite direction. Retie twine with the vines to the support wire. Be sure to leave at least 4-5 feet of extra twine for this purpose when initially tying vines. Remove any leaves that lie on the soil.<p>

About 40-45 days before terminating harvest, plants can be "topped" by pinching out the terminal growing tip. Keep two leaves above the top flower cluster. Topping vines will force remaining food reserves into maturing fruit already present on the vines. Continue to remove any suckers that develop.<p>

As fruit mature on the lower part of the vine, pinch off older leaves below the fruit. This will provide better air circulation, which helps to reduce the incidence of disease and opens vines up for spraying and harvesting.<p>

Growers should remove any deformed, immature fruit which will ultimately become culls. Removing excess fruit also will result in larger tomatoes at harvest that can be sold at a premium price.<p>

<h3>Pollination</h3>
Mechanical pollination of tomato flowers is generally needed in the greenhouse due to limited air movement and high humidity. An electric or battery-powered vibrator can be used to vibrate flower clusters just above the area where they originate from the stem. The vibration will release pollen necessary for pollination. This can be done twice a day (around 10:00 am and 3:00 pm). If tobacco mosaic virus has been a problem, the vibrator should be wiped after each use with a clean cloth or sponge moistened in a 5 percent chlorine solution. Because all flowers on a cluster do not open at the same time, the same cluster will have to be vibrated again as new flowers open. Air from a mist-blower also has been found effective in pollinating tomatoes.<p>

A number of factors can result in poor fruit set. The most common problem is temperature extremes (above 90&#176;F during the daytime, above 75&#176;F at night, or below 57&#176;F at night). Other adverse conditions include high humidity, low light intensity, nutrient imbalances, pests, and water stress.<p>

<h3>Plant Nutrition</h3>
Optimum soil pH for tomato production is 5.8&#045;6.8. Depending on a soil analysis, phosphorous should be applied pre-plant incorporated at a rate of 200-400 lb/a of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. Soils deficient in potassium may require similar quantities of potassium (K<sub>2</sub>0). Both the phosphorous (treble-superphosphate) and potassium (potassium sulfate) should be incorporated to a depth of 8-12 inches. Approximately 50 lb/a of elemental nitrogen should be applied before planting. Additional nitrogen can be applied as a sidedressing or through the irrigation system as needed. Leaf analysis is the best way to determine additional nutrient requirements. Plants exhibiting deficiencies of minor elements such as iron or zinc can be treated with foliar applications of iron or zinc sulfates or chelates.<p>

<h3>Mulching</h3>
A mulch of clean straw can be placed around plants to a depth of 3-4 inches. Mulches will help conserve moisture and keep soil from compacting between plants. Mulches are most effective when used in combination with drip irrigation.<p>

<h3>Harvesting</h3>
Fruit should remain on the vine for as long as possible for maximum quality. However, market specifications will determine whether fruit should be harvested earlier (light red stage). Plants are generally harvested two to three times a week. Fruit should be snapped from the plant leaving a small portion of the pedicel and green calyx bracts attached to the fruit, a distinct trademark for greenhouse-grown tomatoes.<p>

Tomatoes should be graded using USDA standards. Most buyers prefer U.S. No. 1 fruit. The best market for greenhouse-grown tomatoes in New Mexico is between November and April.<p>

Ripe fruit should be cooled to 55&#176;F for maximum shelf life, but never allow the temperature to drop below 50&#176;F. Light-colored fruit can be held at 70&#176;F until the desired color is achieved.<p>

Greenhouse tomatoes are generally marketed in 8- to 10-pound baskets or cartons. Some two-layered cartons may hold 16&#045;20 pounds of fruit. Cartons should be sturdy enough to prevent mechanical damage when handling. Fruit and packaging should be distinctly labeled with decals or other identification to distinguish them as greenhouse-grown tomatoes.<p>

<h3>Pest Control</h3>
<b>Diseases.</b> Diseases are best controlled through prevention. Selecting a sunny site with a well-drained soil, sterilizing the soil, providing good air circulation, and monitoring your irrigation closely will help keep diseases to a minimum. Nevertheless, keep a good supply of recommended fungicides on hand with an appropriate sprayer that will effectively cover all plant surfaces.<p>

Seedling diseases include seed rot (failure of seed to germinate due to fungi), stem rot, and pre- and post-emergence damping-off. Damping-off refers to the attack of seedlings before and after emergence from the soil. Symptoms include the development of dry or water-soaked lesions at the soil line, resulting in stem constriction and plants toppling over. Seedling diseases are most commonly caused by soil-borne fungi like <i>Pythium</i> spp. and <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>. Soil sterilization, seed treatment with appropriate fungicides, and good cultural practices are the most common control methods.<p>

Root-knot nematodes cause plants to become stunted and wilt (diurnal wilting is common). Roots develop knots, galls, or swelling. Secondary symptoms of nutrient deficiencies may result from the inability of roots to take up the necessary nutrients. Soil sterilization is the most effective control measure.<p>

Verticillium and Fusarium wilts cause leaves to become yellow along the margins and between veins. Plants become stunted and wilt severely during the day, but recover at night. Eventually the entire plant dies. Vascular tissue is streaked brown (streaking occurs high on the stem and into petiole scars with Fusarium wilt, and occurs on lower stems and is not evident in petiole scars with Verticillium wilt). For best control, use soil sterilization and plant resistant varieties.<p>

Leaf mold (<i>Fulvia fulva</i> = <i>Cladosporium fulvum</i>) is the most common and destructive disease in greenhouse-grown tomatoes, and is particularly severe under conditions of high humidity. Lower leaves develop pale green spots on their upper surfaces and eventually turn yellow; spots become covered with patches of olive-green to brown mold on the bottoms of leaves. Maintaining humidity below 90 percent by providing good air circulation will help control this disease. Use appropriate fungicides, resistant varieties, and soil sterilization for maximum results.<p>

Gray mold (<i>Botrytis cinerea</i>) is a grayish, powdery, moldy growth on fruit, leaves, and stems. Use similar control measures as for leaf mold; resistant varieties are unavailable.<p>

Early blight (<i>Alternaria solani</i>), which may occur at any time in the season, causes collar rot of seedlings and spotting on leaves and fruit. Note that concentric rings on leaves create a target pattern. Use similar controls as for leaf mold.<p>

Bacterial wilt (<i>Pseudomonas solanacearum</i>) causes diseased plants to wilt and die rapidly (with no yellowing or leaf necrosis). The pith in the stem near the soil line will become water-soaked and dark. Best controls include good sanitation and soil sterilization.<p>

Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) disease reduces fruit set and quality. A mosaic or mottled appearance of the leaves is the most common symptom. Plants infected as seedlings are usually stunted and slightly yellow; the leaves also may be curled, small, or deformed. Greenhouse workers should wash their hands carefully with soap and water after using tobacco products. Remove any diseased plants as they appear.<p>

Fruit rots are caused by fungi like <i>Alternaria, Phytophthora,</i> and <i>Botrytis</i>. Maintaining optimum temperature and humidity are critical for good control. Use of registered fungicides can help to reduce the incidence and severity of fruit rots as can good greenhouse sanitation. Handle fruit carefully to prevent bruising.<p>

Physiological diseases that can cause problems with greenhouse-grown tomatoes are blossom-end rot and sunscald. Blossom-end rot occurs when tomatoes are stressed for water and calcium, resulting in the formation of a sunken, brown, leathery spot on the blossom-end of the fruit. Monitoring soil moisture and mulches will help prevent this problem. Over-exposure of the fruit to sun can result in sunscald. Training of vines and leaves to cover developing fruit should solve this problem.<p>

<b>Insects.</b> Aphids are small, soft-bodied insects that insert piercing-sucking mouth parts into tomato plants to extract plant juices. Heavy populations can cause leaf curling and plant stunting. Aphids also serve as vectors for several plant diseases. Sticky honeydew produced by aphids may result in growth of black sooty mold.<p>

Whitefly adults are small, winged, white insects 1/16" long. They suck juices from plants and, like aphids, whiteflies are vectors for some diseases. Honeydew produced by whiteflies also will support growth of black sooty mold.<p>

Thrips are very small insects with piercing-sucking mouth parts that feed on plant juices. They can spread tomato spotted wilt viruses and cause premature blossom drop.<p>

Spider mites are non-insect pests (related to spiders) that feed on plant juices on underside of leaves. Leaves may become stippled (gray) and covered with a fine web; defoliation can occur with heavy infestations. Mites are yellowish to greenish with a dark spot on either side.<p>

Other insect and non-insect pests that can cause occasional problems include cutworms, earwigs, snails, slugs, and various caterpillars. Sanitation, soil sterilization, screens on ventilation fans, and appropriate insecticides should be used for maximum control of pests.<p>
<br>
<h2>Cucumber</h2>
<h3>Planting</h3>
Cucumbers generally grow more rapidly than tomatoes and produce earlier. They also require higher temperatures, which means they are generally grown as a spring or early summer crop. Daytime temperatures should be 80&#045;85&#176;F (nighttime 65&#045;75&#176;F). Soil temperatures should be at least 65&#176;F. Lower temperatures will delay plant growth and fruit development.<p>

Cucumbers are heavy feeders requiring 300&#045;400 lb/a of P<sub>2</sub>0<sub>5</sub>. Similar quantities of potassium are required. Weekly feedings with a balanced fertilizer (20-20-20) will be required for maximum production. Never stress seedlings for water or nitrogen.<p>

Plants are best started in individual containers. As seed are often very expensive, sow one seed per container (1/4 to 1/2 inch deep) in a sterile potting mix with the spiked end of the seed up (root will emerge facing down). Water, cover pots with clear polyethylene, and place in the shade. Plants will emerge in two to three days at 80&#045;85&#176;F. Remove plastic coverings when plants emerge and place them in full sun.<p>

After plants have formed at least two true leaves, transplant them to their permanent location in the growing bed. Cucumbers will require 6&#045;8 square feet of space per plant. Plants are generally spaced 2 feet apart in rows 3 to 4 feet apart.<p>

<h3>Training</h3>
Cucumber vines can be trained on plastic twine supported from horizontal support wires running the length of the rows (7&#045;8 feet above top of bed). The base of the string can be anchored loosely to the base of the stem with a non-slip noose.<p>

As the stem develops, it can be fastened to the string with plastic clips. Allow one stem to develop, removing all laterals and tendrils as they develop. Fruit buds should be removed from the first five leaf nodes. Thereafter, fruit can be allowed to develop, but continue to remove all laterals and tendrils.<p>

After the stem reaches the horizontal support wire, it can be trained along the wire and then down another string suspended from the horizontal wire between the two plants in the row. The stem is then allowed to follow the string downwards to within 18 inches of the bed. It is then trained back up the original string with the stem forming a circle. Remove old leaves on the older part of the stem ahead of the developing stem terminal.<p>

Fruit should develop at each node. Remember to remove all laterals and tendrils to encourage fruit production. Fruit production should continue for approximately 60 days.<p>

<h3>Varieties</h3>
Seedless (parthenocarpic) or all female (gynoecious) varieties are generally recommended for greenhouse cucumber production. These types generally produce higher yields and do not require bees for pollination. European seedless cucumbers are generally the most popular type of cucumber grown in the greenhouse. 'Mustang' is suitable for early or fall cropping and has potential for high total production. This variety has excellent fruit shelf life and color, with 12- to 14-inch fruit. 'Bronco' is suitable for very early spring or late fall cropping (low light conditions). It produces high quality fruit 12&#045;14 inches long. Other popular varieties that have performed well include 'Sandra', 'Boneva', 'Daleva', 'Padex', 'Fertila', 'Factum', 'Femspot', 'Femfrance', 'Toska 70', 'Farbio', 'Corona', 'Sweet Slice', 'Radja', 'Bella', and 'La Reine'.<p>

<h3>Harvesting</h3>
With good management, each plant may produce as much as 20&#045;30 pounds of fruit over a four-month period. European varieties are generally harvested when fruit are 12&#045;16 inches long and 3/4&#045;1 pound in size. Fruit are often shrink-wrapped to prevent softening from moisture loss. Store fruit at 55&#176;F with 80&#045;90 percent relative humidity.<p>

Seedless European greenhouse cucumbers are distinctly different from traditional field-grown cucumbers. Because of consumer expectations for field-grown cucumbers, greenhouse cucumbers may require some market promotion. Excellent selling points include their seedlessness, dark green color, mild flavor, and thin, tender skins that require no peeling.<p>

<h3>Pest Control</h3>
Diseases. Gummy stem blight (<i>Didymella bryoniae</i>) is a fungus that occurs on all above-ground parts of the plant causing extensive damage to leaves, stems, and fruit. Light brown to black lesions occur on leaves, at nodes, and in pruning wounds. Leaf lesions eventually dry and fall from leaves. Stem lesions can crack at the soil line, producing an amber-colored gummy ooze, and can girdle the plant resulting in death. This disease also can occur as grayish-green water-soaked lesions on fruit beginning at the blossom end and can develop on fruit after harvest. Control by using steam sterilization of soil, good sanitation, crop rotation, and good ventilation. Avoid night temperatures below 60&#176;F and overhead irrigation. Use preventative fungicides.<p>

Powdery mildew (<i>Sphaerotheca fuliginea and Erysiphe cichoracearum</i>) fungus first appears as pale yellow leaf spots. The spots rapidly enlarge to fine cottony growth on the leaf surface. The spots also can occur on the stems and fruit. The fungus causes severe stress on plants as leaves yellow and die. Powdery spores produced on the leaf surface spread from plant to plant by air currents. Control through good sanitation, preventative fungicides, and resistant varieties.<p>

Other diseases that can occasionally cause problems include various viruses (cucumber mosaic and watermelon mosaic), gray mold (<i>Botrytis</i>), damping-off, and crooking. Crooking is a physiological disorder often caused by temperature extremes, excessive soil moisture, and nutrition imbalances. Fruit will become excessively curved, reducing its market value.<p>

<b>Insects</b>. Insect pests include whitefly, thrip, leaf miner, and other non-insect pests like two-spotted mites. Insects can gain entrance into the greenhouse through vents, doorways, openings in the greenhouse, and even on clothing and equipment. Regular plant inspections are important for immediate and effective control.<p>
<br>
<h2>Lettuce</h2>

Lettuce is generally grown when light intensities are low and temperatures are cool. Plants prefer a daylight temperature of 60&#045;65&#176;F and a nighttime temperature of 50&#045;55&#176;F. High greenhouse temperatures will often result in spindly growth and seedstalk development in some varieties. A crop of lettuce can be scheduled between fall and spring tomato crops.<p>

Lettuce usually takes about one month from seeding to transplanting. Days to harvest from seeding may vary from 12&#045;15 weeks in mid-winter and from 8&#045;10 weeks in early spring. Under poor light intensities a 9 x 9-inch spacing may be used, while a 6 x 6-inch spacing can be used in the spring as light conditions improve.<p>

Lettuce is a poor feeder, but requires a high level of nutrition. Apply a balanced fertilizer before planting with weekly nitrogen feedings as needed.<p>

Leaf and Bibb lettuce varieties are the most common types grown in the greenhouse. Popular leaf lettuce varieties include 'Waldmann's Dark Green', 'Grand Rapids', and 'Ruby'. Bibb lettuce varieties include 'Ostinata' and 'Salina'.<p>
<br>
<h2>Other Greenhouse Crops</h2>

Other crops that have done well under greenhouse conditions include sweet peppers, eggplant, and herbs like basil. Popular pepper varieties include 'Cubico' (red), 'Locas' (red), 'Samanta' (yellow), and 'Doria' (yellow).<p>

<TITLE>BEE ALERT: What is the Africanized Honey Bee?</title>
</head>

<h1>BEE ALERT: What is the Africanized Honey Bee?</h1>
<h2>Guide L-102</h2>
<h3>Charles R. Ward, Extension Entomologist</h3>
<h3>A NEW PUBLIC NUISANCE</h3>
The Africanized honey bee, popularly known as the "killer bee," has moved into South Texas and Mexico and is moving into New Mexico and the southern and southwestern United States. Scientists are not certain how far north the bee will spread, but they do know that it will cause problems wherever it resides in large numbers.<p>
This insect, which has been migrating from South America since the 1950s, looks just like a domestic honey bee, but it is not nearly as good natured. In fact, it has a bit of a quick temper.<p>
The domestic bee has lived in harmony with human beings for hundreds of years. It has been bred for gentleness and good honey production.<p>
By contrast, the Africanized bee is a "wild" bee that is not comfortable being around people or animals. Any colony of bees will defend its hive, but Africanized bees do so with gusto. These bees are more likely to sense a threat at greater distances, become more upset with less reason, and sting in much greater numbers.<p>
<h3>MORE PEOPLE WILL GET STUNG</h3>
More people probably will be stung by bees wherever Africanized honey bees become established. Some individuals may get stung hundreds of times in only a few moments.<p>
The Africanized bee's "killer" reputation is greatly exaggerated, but it does have some basis in fact. In isolated instances, people and animals have been stung to death. Most often, the person who died was not able to get away from the bees quickly. Animal losses have occurred for the same reasons. Pets and livestock were tied up or penned when they encountered the bees.<p>
However, Africanized bees do not roam in giant swarms looking for victims to attack. Like most animals, these bees react defensively only when they feel threatened.<p>
The Africanized bee is a new insect nuisance, but it does not have to change the way people live and work and play. People in parts of Central and South America have lived with this bee for several decades without great difficulty.<p>
<h3>BEEKEEPERS ARE THREATENED</h3>
Beyond public safety, the Africanized honey bee will have the greatest impact on beekeepers. Commercial beekeepers could go out of business if Africanized bees drive out or breed into their domestic colonies.<p>
Because honey bees provide 80 percent of the pollination required by agricultural crops, a reduction in the number of beekeepers could lead to reduced yields in apples and melons and other commodities as well as a decline in honey production. This would tend to increase the occurrence of wild feral hives of Africanized bees.<p>
Beekeepers are working closely with state and federal agencies to minimize the impacts of the Africanized bee.<p>
<h3>KNOW THE BEE'S BEHAVIOR</h3>
Your best protection against the Africanized bee is to understand how it behaves and react accordingly.<p>
Bees "swarm" to establish new hives in the spring and fall. Bees are most active then. You may find bees setting up housekeeping where you live literally overnight.<p>
Individual bees gathering pollen on flowers or masses of bees clinging together in swarms generally will not bother you. However, bees are more likely to be defensive after they have established a colony and started raising young.<p>
<h3>WHAT SHOULD I DO ABOUT THE AFRICANIZED BEE?</h3>
<b>Take some common-sense precautionsä</b><p>
<li>Make a "bee patrol" around your home once or twice a week during swarming seasons. Listen for the sound of bees in the air. Persistent buzzing may mean a hive or swarm is nearby.<p>
<li>"Bee-proof" your home by filling in potential nesting sites such as tree cavities and holes in outside walls. Put screens on the top of rain spouts and over water meter boxes in the ground. Remove piles of trash and junk.<p>
<li>If you discover a bee colony, don't disturb it. Find out who removes or destroys wild colonies in your area and report it to them.<p>
<li>If attacked by Africanized honey bees, your best defense is to run away as fast as you can. Seek shelter immediately in a building, a car, or heavy brush.<p>
<li>If you are stung many times, seek medical attention immediately.<p>
<li>If you are allergic to bee stings, or think you might be, consult your physician for the best precautions to take when the Africanized bee reaches your area.<p>

<TITLE>Tanning Deer Hides and Small Fur Skins</title
</head>
<body BGCOLOR="#ffffff" text="#000000" link="#0000c0" vlink="#000090"><img src="/cahe/images/pr.gif" height=100 width=129 align=right alt="NMSU College of Agriculture & Home Economics">
<h1>Tanning Deer Hides and Small Fur Skins</h1>
<h2>Guide L-103</h2>
<h3>James E. Knight, Extension Wildlife Specialist</h3>
	Because preserving hides and furs is a very old art, many successful methods have been developed through the years. Native Americans used wood ashes to remove the hair and used deer brains as a tanning agent. Squaws chewed the hides to produce a soft buckskin, but few modern hobby tanners would want to try these methods. <p>
	Deer hides and small fur skins can be tanned at home. Tanning requires few tools, and chemicals required for most methods can be obtained locally. Because possession of wildlife pelts is governed by game laws, consult your local game warden before you begin. <p>
	Tanning leather or furs requires time and patience. No tanning formula is foolproof, and success can be attained only through hard work, close observation, care, and patience. Inexperienced tanners should realize that their first attempts will not produce professional-quality leather. If the fur or hide is quite valuable, it would be best to send it to a professional and use a less valuable hide for beginning projects.<p>
	Deer and squirrel hides and furs are probably best to start with, primarily because they are easy to prepare for the tanning process. Others such as rabbit are thin-skinned and require more care to avoid damage.<p>

<h3>PRELIMINARY PREPARATIONS* </h3>
	If tanning cannot begin within one day, hides or pelts must be  treated or  cured to prevent deterioration.<p>

* For a complete explanation of preparing skins prior to tanning, see Extension Guide L-101, <i>How to Prepare Pelts.</i><p>

<h3>TREATING SMALL ANIMAL PELTS</h3>
	To preserve small animal pelts, air-dry them thoroughly. This may done two ways: To prepare skins for sale, case the skin and dry it on a frame. For hobby tanning, split the skin down the belly and dry it flat; tack the skin to a board with the flesh side out to facilitate drying.<p>

<h3>CURING LARGE ANIMAL PELTS</h3>
	Small hides, such as rabbit, will dry thoroughly from air circulation alone, but large pelts must be salted. Promptly salt deer hides and other large pelts (such as coyote skins) to remove moisture, prevent spoilage, and discourage flies. The salting procedure may be repeated after the first application of salt becomes saturated with moisture, usually in two to three days. Dry hides may be stored as late as the onset of warm weather in April or May. Do not keep untanned hides or skins over the summer because they may deteriorate and be damaged by insects.<p>
<i>	Flesh the hide</i>: Cut away any pieces of flesh that may still be attached after the hide has been removed from the carcass.<p>
	<i>Trim the hide</i>: Trim any ragged edges on the hide, being careful to cut from the skin side.<p>
	<i>Salt the hide</i>: Spread the hide, hair side down, on a flat surface. Sprinkle fresh, clean salt over the flesh side of the hide, using a pound of salt for each pound of hide. Be sure to sprinkle salt on all parts of the flesh side; rub the salt into the cut edges, neck, legs, and wrinkles. Remember, any unsalted spot is unprotected. <p>
	To cure several hides at once, pile them with the hair side down, and salt each one on the flesh side. Be sure not to disturb the salt layer when piling on another hide, as this will cause unsalted spots and spoiled hides. Tilt the pile slightly so liquid from the hides drains away from the pile and doesn't collect on the bottom hide.1<p>
	<i>Dry the hide</i>: In 10-14 days, hang the hide(s) to dry thoroughly. <p>

<h3>SOAKING AND CLEANING</h3>
	Before tanning, soften the skins and clean it thoroughly so it is free of flesh and grease. If you cured the skin, soak it in water to soften it.<p>
1.	Split the tail the entire length on the underside. If the skin is cased, split it neatly down the middle of the belly. <p>
2.	Soak the skin in several changes of clear cool water. Use a wooden barrel, large earthen crock, or 5- to 10-gallon plastic garbage can for all soaking and tanning processes. Never use a metal container, as the salt and tanning chemicals will react with the metal.<p>
	While a skin must be soaked until soft, do not allow it to stay wet longer than necessary because the hair may start to slip. Soaking time depends upon the condition of the skin; some skins require only about two hours, while others need a much longer time.<p>
3.	When the skin begins to soften, lay it on a smooth board and begin working over the flesh side to break up the adhering tissue and fat. (To work the skin, hold the skin taut and pull it back and forth over a the edge of a board.) All dried skins have a shiny, tight layer of tissue that must be broken up and entirely removed; this can be done by alternately scraping and soaking the hide. <p>
	A good tool for scraping the tissue is a metal edge with dull saw teeth or notches filed in it. An old hacksaw blade works well. (The flint scrapers Native Americans used were good tools for this task.)<p>
	Take care not to injure the true skin or expose the hair roots, especially on thin skins.<p>
4.	When the skin is almost soft, put it in lukewarm water containing an ounce of soda or borax per gallon; you may also add soap to this solution. Use a paddle to stir the skin around in the solution. This treatment promotes final softening, cleans the skin, and cuts the grease.<p>
5.	Lie the skin on a smooth board, flesh-side up. Work the skin with the back edge of a knife held nearly flat against the side. This operation is called "scudding" and is of utmost importance.<p>
6.	Rinse the skin thoroughly in lukewarm water. Squeeze out most of the water, but do not wring the skin.<p>
	If the skin is to be tanned with the hair on, proceed to the section on tanning. <p>
7.	If you are tanning a deer hide into buckskin, remove the hair before tanning. To dehair, mix 4-5 qt hydrated lime with 5 gal water. Make sure the hide is completely immersed and no air is trapped in the hide. Soak the hide until the hair slides off easily with a push of your hand (6-10 days). Place the hide over a board and push off all the hair with the back side of a dull knife. Scud both sides of the hide.<p>
8.	After the hide has been dehaired, soak it in clean water for four or five hours, then scud the skin again.<p>
	Fill a container with 10 gal of water and stir in 1 oz United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) lactic acid, mixing thoroughly with a wooden paddle. (If you cannot get lactic acid, substitute 1 pint vinegar for each ounce of lactic acid.) Soak the hide into this solution for 24 hours to stop the action of the lime. <p>

	Several tanning methods are given below. <i>Salt and alum </i>tannage (or tanning process) is the least expensive method and a good choice for the beginner. <i>Alcohol and turpentine </i>would also be a good choice for a beginning project on a small fur skin. <i>Chrome </i>tannage produces a durable buckskin, but is more difficult. <i>Glutaraldehyde </i>tannage produces the best quality home-tanned skin; however, it is also the most costly and the chemicals necessary are not easy to obtain.<p>

<h3>ALCOHOL AND TURPENTINE TANNAGE</h3>
	This method is perhaps the easiest for small fur skins and has been used successfully with rabbit and squirrel skins.<p>
1.	Mix the tanning solution. <p>
	Use a large-mouthed gallon jar with a screw top. Add equal parts wood alcohol and turpentine to the jar to cover a small fur skin. A half pint of each is sufficient for a squirrel or rabbit skin.<p>
2.	Shake or stir the solution each day, because the alcohol and turpentine will separate.<p>
3.	After 7-10 days, remove the skin and wash it in dishwashing or laundry detergent water to remove the alcohol, turpentine, and grease. <p>
4.	Rinse the skin well several times to remove the detergent. <p>
5.	Dry the skin by squeezing, not wringing.<p>
6.	When the skin is partly dry, proceed to the oiling and finishing process.<p>

<h3>SALT AND ALUM TANNAGE</h3>
	This is an old, widely used method for fur skin tanning. When properly carried out, it produces skins with stretch and flexibility. It often happens, however, that alum-tanned skins come out stiff and hard and must be worked repeatedly and sometimes retanned.<p>
1.	Prepare a salt-alum tanning solution: <p>
	Dissolve 1 lb ammonia alum or potash alum in 1 gal water. Dissolve 4 oz washing soda (crystallized sodium carbonate) and 8 oz salt in 1/2 gal water. Pour the soda-salt solution very slowly into the alum solution while stirring vigorously.<p>
2.	Immerse the skin in the tanning solution for 2-5 days, depending upon its thickness.<p>
<pre>					ORã</pre>
	Apply the liquor as a paste. Because alum affects some furs, it may be best to apply the tanning liquor as a paste to the flesh side only. <p>
<ul>
<li>	Mix the tanning liquor with sufficient flour to make a thin paste, adding the flour in small quantities with a little water and mixing thoroughly to avoid lumps.<p>
<li>	Spread the skin so it lies smoothly and tack down, flesh side up. Using a brush or scraper knife, coat the skin with paste about 1/8" thick. Let stand until the next day.<p>
<li>	The next day, scrape off most of the paste and apply another coating. Apply two or three coatings at daily intervals. Only thick skins should need as many as three treatments. Leave the last coating on for 3-4 days.<p>
<li>	Scrape off the paste.<p>
</ul>
3.	Rinse the hide clean in a gallon of water containing about 1 oz borax. Rinse again in clear water. Put the skin on a smooth board and use a dull edge to press out most of the water.<p>

<h3>CHROME TANNAGE</h3>
	All chemicals for this process must be good quality and weighed accurately. Also, measure the water carefully. Make the tanning solution at least two days before it is to be used.<p>
1.	Make the tanning solution.<p>
	The following chemicals are required for this tanning solution: chrome alum (chromium potassium sulfate crystals); soda crystals (crystallized sodium carbonate); and common salt (sodium chloride).<p>
	For two or three deer hides weighing not more than 30 lb total, use the following quantities for the tanning solution:<p>
<ul>
<li>	Dissolve 1 3/4 lb of soda crystals and 3 lb of common salt in 1 1/2 gal of warm, clean water in a plastic bucket. The soda crystals must be clear or glasslike; do not use any white crusted lumps.<p>
<li>	At the same time, dissolve 6 lb of chrome alum in 4 1/2 gal of cool, clean water. Use a large plastic garbage can, wooden barrel, or crockãnot a metal container. Use only the very dark, hard, glossy, purple-colored chrome alum crystals, not the lighter, crumbly, dull lavender ones. The alum will take some time to dissolve and will need frequent stirring.<p>
<li>	When the chemicals in each container are dissolved, slowly pour the soda-salt solution in a thin stream into the chrome-alum solution, stirring constantly. Take at least 10 minutes to pour the soda solution to prevent foaming over container. Keep this stock chrome solution in a covered container.<p>
</ul>
2.	To begin tanning, pour one-third (2 gal) of the stock chrome solution into a clean 30-gallon plastic garbage can and add 15 gal of clean, cool water. Mix the solution thoroughly.<p>
	Place the hides in the solution. Move the hides about and stir the solution every hour or so throughout the first day, and frequently during the next day or two, as stirring gives the hides an even color. Suspend the hides in the solution and keep them as smooth as possible for the best tannage.<p>
	After the hides have been in the solution for two or three days, temporarily remove the hides from the barrel. Add one-half (2 gal) of the remaining stock chrome solution, thoroughly mixing it with that in the barrel. Suspend the hides in it for another day or two. Move the hides about and stir the solution three or four times each day.<p>
	Once more, temporarily remove the hides. Pour the rest of the stock chrome solution into the barrel, mixing it thoroughly with the solution in the garbage can. Suspend the hides in it for two days. Move the hides about and stir frequently as before.<p>
	Test for completion: Cut off a small piece of the thickest part of the hide, usually in the neck, and examine the freshly cut edge of the piece.  If the cut edge seems to be evenly colored greenish or bluish all the way through, the tanning is almost finished. Boil the small piece of skin in water for a few minutes. If it curls up and becomes hard or rubbery, the tanning is not complete and the hides must be left in the tanning solution for a few days longer, or until a small piece is changed little when boiled in water.<p>
3.	When the hides are tanned, take them out of the tanning solution and put them in a barrel of clean water. (The barrel in which the tanning was done can be re-used after it has been washed thoroughly.) Wash the hides in about four changes of clear water. <p>
	<b>CAUTION</b>: When emptying the tanning barrel, be sure to dispose of the tanning solution carefully. Check with your local waste management authorities for proper disposal of the solution. Although not poisonous to the touch, the solution is harmful to soil and would probably be fatal for farm animals.<p>
4.	Soak the hides overnight in a solution of 1 lb borax in about 20 gal of water. Move the hides about in the borax solution often. <p>
5.	After soaking the hides in the borax solution, soak them in clean water for an entire day, changing the water five or six times. Remove the hides and drain.<p>

<h3>GLUTARALDEHYDE TANNAGE</h3>
1.	Weigh the damp hide or skin and record the weight; use this measure whenever the instructions below refer to the weight of the hide.<p>
2.	Mix the tanning solution:<p>
	For each pound of deer hide or fur skin, place 5 qt of water (approximately 85°F) in a clean wooden barrel, crock, or plastic garbage can. Add 1/2 lb of technical grade salt for each gallon of water and stir with a wooden paddle until dissolved. Measure 2 1/4 fluid oz of glutaraldehyde (25% commercial solution) for each pound of hide. Pour the glutaraldehyde carefully into the salt solution and stir well.<p>
	<b>CAUTION</b>: Glutaraldehyde is an irritant. Avoid contact with skin and eyes. Avoid inhaling the vapors. Use rubber gloves, a rubber apron, a safety visor or safety glasses, and adequate ventilation.<p>
3.	<i>Tan the hides</i>:
	Immerse the hides in the glutaraldehyde solution carefully to avoid splashing. Stir for about 5 minutes with a wooden paddle, then for 1 minute at hourly intervals during the day. Cover the container between stirrings and overnight. The skin will become pale yellow as tanning proceeds. Allow the skins to stand overnight completely immersed in the solution.<p>
	Continue the tanning for at least another 48 hours, stirring the solution 1 minute per hour on the second day.<p>
	<i>Test for completion</i>: Cut off a small piece of the thickest part of the skin, usually in the neck, and boil the small piece in water for a few minutes. If it curls up and becomes hard and rubbery, the tanning is not complete and the hides must be left in the tanning solution a day or two longer. Even though tanning is complete when the boiled leather shows little change, a fuller, softer leather can be obtained by continuing the tanning for another day.<p>


<h3>OILING AND FINISHING</h3>
	Let the wet, tanned leather dry somewhat. While it is still quite damp, apply a coating of suitable fat liquor oil (such as sulfated neatsfoot oil). The amount of oil required will vary depending upon the natural oiliness of the skin. For instance, a raccoon skin, which is naturally very oily, will require proportionately less oil than a deer hide. <p>
1.	Make the fat liquor oil by mixing 3 1/2 oz of sulfated neatsfoot oil with 3 1/2 oz of warm water; add 1 oz household ammonia. This fat liquor solution is for a 10-pound deer hide. Adjust the proportions for smaller hides.<p>
2.	Place the hide on a flat surface hair side down. Apply part of the fat liquor solution to a portion of the hide and spread it evenly with a paint brush or your hand. Continue until one-half the solution has been applied to the hide. Allow the hide to stand for 30 minutes, then apply the remainder of the oil in the same way. <p>
3.	Cover the hide with a sheet of plastic and let stand overnight. If several skins are fat-liquored at one time, they may be piled flesh side to flesh side.<p>
4.	The next day, drape the skin, hair side out, over a pole or sawhorse and allow the hair to dry. Use an electric fan to speed the drying.<p>
5.	Nail the skin, flesh side up, to a plywood board, stretching the skin slightly. Space the nails (no. 6 finish) every 5 or 6" around the circumference and about 1/2" from the edge. Dry the flesh side at room temperature.<p>
6.	When the skin is nearly dry but still slightly damp, work the skin in all directions, stretching it from corner to corner and working the flesh side over a stake or a wooden edge, such as the back of a chair or piece of board clamped in a vise. The skin may also be worked this way through smooth metal rings.<p>
	Success in producing a soft skin lies in repeated working, which must be done while the skin is drying out, not after it is dry. This process may be repeated several times if necessary; simply dampen the hide evenly and work it again while it dries. <p>
7.	After the skin has been softened and dried, give it a hasty bath in white or unleaded gasoline, especially if the skin is too greasy. This bath also helps to deodorize some skins, such as skunk.<p>
	<b>CAUTION</b>: Gasoline is extremely flammable and should be used outdoors away from fire or flame.<p>
8.	To clean and brighten the fur, tumble it repeatedly in dry, warm sawdustãpreferably hardwood sawdust. Bran or cornmeal may also be used. Clean the particles out of the fur by gently shaking, beating, combing, and brushing the fur.<p>
9.	If necessary, the skin's flesh side may be smoothed by working it with a sandpaper block. This also helps to further soften the skin. If desired, thicker sections of the skin may be thinned and made more flexible by shaving off some of the skin or hide.<p>

<h1>Water Quality Management in Fed Fish Ponds in New Mexico</h1>
<h2>Guide L-106</h2>
<h3>Michael B. Sloane, Extension Aquaculturist</h3>

Fish are directly affected by several chemical factors and biological processes in fish ponds. Controlling these factors and processes is referred to as "water quality management." Proper water quality management of a fish pond requires a 
basic understanding of these factors and processes.<p>

Water quality management is important because proper management will save fish producers and recreational fish pond owners from potentially catastrophic fish losses due to diseases or oxygen depletions. This savings translates directly into increased income or recreation in the form of increased fish production.<p>

A fed fish pond is a pond where artificial feeds are used to feed fish. This guide covers the basic chemical factors, the biological processes, and the tools used to monitor and manage water quality.<p>


<h3>IMPORTANT CHEMICAL FACTORS</h3>

Many chemical factors should be considered when first analyzing water for a fish production system. The factors listed below should be checked regularly while the system is in production.<p>
_________________________________________________________________________________
<pre>	Chemical factor			|	Optimum range
________________________________________|________________________________________
	Ammonia				|	< 0.012 ppm
	Carbon Dioxide			|	0 to 10 ppm
	Nitrite				|	< 0.2 ppm
	Oxygen				|	> 3 ppm
	pH				|	6.5 to 9.0
	Total alkalinity (as CaCO3)	|	> 20 ppm
	Total hardness (as CaCO3)	|	> 20 ppm
_________________________________________________________________________________

</pre>

<i>Ammonia </i>is a waste product produced by fish and by the breakdown of excess feed in the pond. It exists in both an ionized form and a toxic un-ionized form in ponds. Levels of unionized ammonia exceeding 0.012 ppm are toxic to fish. The percentage of un-ionized ammonia in the water depends on pH and temperature. The percentage of un-ionized ammonia in the water is greater at higher temperatures and pH; at lower temperatures and pH the percentage of un-ionized ammonia is small.<p>

<i>Carbon dioxide </i>is a respiratory product produced by both fish and phytoplankton. Levels in excess of 10 ppm have been shown to be toxic to fish and some evidence suggests that carbon dioxide acts as an anesthetic for fish. High levels of carbon dioxide also indicate acidic water but some carbon dioxide is necessary for the buffering capacity of the water (i.e., the ability of the water to neutralize acids or bases added to the water).<p>

<i>Nitrites </i>are produced via bacterial breakdown of waste products in the pond. Levels greater than 0.2 ppm have been shown to be toxic to fish. Nitrites react with fish hemoglobin to produce methemoglobin, which cannot carry oxygen. The result is "brown blood disease" and fish mortality. Chronic low levels of nitrites can cause stress and lead to disease in fish. Salt is commonly added to ponds to reduce high levels of nitrites.<p>

<i>Dissolved oxygen </i>is produced by phytoplankton in the pond. Levels below 3 ppm lead to stress and can cause mortality. Control of the phytoplankton community and aerating the pond can reduce the risk of oxygen depletions and fish kills.
pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of water. Water below a pH of 6.0 is too acidic for fish culture; water above a pH of 9.0 is too alkaline. pH in ponds can be controlled, but the methods for doing so are expensive and not suggested for fish ponds. Daily fluctuations in pH are common due to phytoplankton effects.<p>

<i>Total alkalinity </i>is the concentration of bases (substances that can neutralize an acid) in the pond. It results primarily from the bicarbonate ions present in the pond buffering system. Total alkalinity should be greater than 20 ppm for acceptable fish growth.<p>

<i>Total hardness </i>is a measure of the calcium and magnesium in the water and it should be greater than 20 ppm for acceptable fish growth.<p>


<H3>POND CYCLES</h3>

Fed fish ponds undergo several chemical cycles due to biological processes. Oxygen concentration and pH are the two most important. Both of these components are based on the biological activity of phytoplankton, which in turn is based on the amount and quality of feed used.<p>

Oxygen concentrations rise during daylight hours as phytoplankton produce oxygen by photosynthesis. During nighttime hours, oxygen concentrations decrease due to respiration by fish and phytoplankton. Higher concentrations of fish and phytoplankton in a pond, therefore, lead to greater fluctuation in oxygen concentration.<p>

Phytoplankton communities develop in ponds due to feeding. Excess feed and fish wastes provide the nutrients, or fertilizer, to support phytoplankton. Feed quality (i.e., feed digestibility and hydrostability) also contributes to oxygen fluctuations by creating additional wastes in the pond. The breakdown of these wastes creates a biological oxygen demand that contributes to the fluctuations seen in pond oxygen concentrations.<p>

pH is another cyclic component of fish ponds also based on the phytoplankton communities' photosynthesis and respiration cycles. Photosynthesizing phytoplankton remove carbon dioxide from the water, causing a rise in pH in poorly buffered waters. Respiring phytoplankton add carbon dioxide to the pond water, decreasing pH. The degree of fluctuation is directly related to the size of the phytoplankton community:  Larger communities will produce greater fluctuations while smaller communities will produce less fluctuation.

The size of the phytoplankton community, therefore, must be carefully monitored. A large community will produce abundant oxygen but may cause nighttime depletions of dissolved oxygen and pH fluctuations. A small community may not provide enough oxygen but limits the fluctuations in both oxygen concentration and pH. A managed balance must be achieved to maintain good water quality and dampen the cycles outlined above.<p>


<h3>POND BUFFERING SYSTEM</h3>

The pond buffering system, based primarily on the bicarbonate ions in the water, dampens, or buffers the fluctuations in pH in the water. Without a buffering system, pH would fluctuate widely due to the removal and addition of carbon dioxide by photosynthesizing phytoplankton and respiring fish and phytoplankton.<p>

The buffering system can be expressed by the following chemical formulas:<p>

<pre>		CO2 + H2O produces H+ + HCO3-<p>

		H+ + CO3 -2 produces HCO3-
</pre>

The formulas show that as carbon dioxide (CO2) is added to the water, hydroxide ion (H+) is produced, lowering the pH. However, the hydroxide ion reacts with carbonate (CO3-2), usually in the form of calcium carbonate, to form bicarbonate (HCO3-), with a pH close to neutral. The production of bicarbonate, therefore, maintains the pH of the system. Removing carbon dioxide from the system causes the reactions to progress from right to left, and bicarbonate breaks down to its constituent parts to maintain the equilibrium and pH.<p>

The buffering system, and hence the total alkalinity of the water, are important in fed fish ponds due to high phytoplankton abundance. Phytoplankton both use and produce carbon dioxide that ensures the buffering system, preventing extreme fluctuations in pH and stress for fish.<p>


<h3>OTHER POND MANAGEMENT CONCERNS</h3>

Temperature stratification and macrophyte (rooted aquatic plant) growth are two other concerns for the fish pond owner. Temperature stratification occurs when surface waters warm to higher temperatures than bottom waters. This prevents mixing of surface and bottom waters, leading to bottom waters becoming anoxic (lacking oxygen). Not only does stratification reduce the volume of the pond usable by fish, it also can lead to severe oxygen depletions. Oxygen depletions occur when the pond "turns over," when anoxic bottom waters mix with the surface waters. This mixing can be caused by a thunderstorm or some other disturbance of surface water temperature. Anoxic bottom water mixed with oxygenated surface water will reduce the oxygen levels in the pond water, leading to fish kills and/or fish disease problems.<p>

Macrophytes, or aquatic plants, are also a water quality management concern, as they can lead to anoxic conditions in pond bottom muds. These conditions cause problems in the chemical balance of the pond as well as in the oxygen cycles of the pond. Macrophytes also create problems during harvesting and sampling. Macrophyte growth is reduced through proper management of the phytoplankton community and feeding regime.<p>


<h3>MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND USES</h3>

The simplest management tool is the secchi disk, which is used to measure the phytoplankton density in a pond. A secchi disk is a circular plate 8" in diameter, painted so that alternate quarters are black or white. A string or yardstick is attached to the center of the disk to allow the disk to be submerged and the depth measured.<p>
The secchi disk is used by lowering it into the water until it can no longer be seen. The disk is then slowly pulled toward the surface until it is barely visible. The depth at which the disk is visible is the secchi disk reading. The depth should be between 18 and 24". Higher values (i.e., deeper) indicate an insufficient phytoplankton community. Lower values (i.e., shallower) than this range indicate a highly dense population of phytoplankton, which must be monitored carefully to ensure oxygen depletions and fish kills do not occur. Monitoring oxygen concentration in the water can be done by chemical analysis or more simply by a dissolved oxygen meter.<p>

Portable water quality test kits can be used to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration in pond water by chemical analysis. They also allow the user to test many of the important chemical components of pond water, thus saving producers from disease problems by indicating when water quality is poor and management steps should be taken.<p>

Dissolved oxygen meters, although expensive, are the simplest method for testing dissolved oxygen in pond water. These meters are used by placing a probe into the water and reading the oxygen concentration in parts per million from a scale. They can also be used to predict the fall in overnight oxygen concentration in a pond by measuring the oxygen concentration in the pond twice at night, approximately one hour apart. The drop in the concentration over one hour is then multiplied by the number of hours until sunrise (when oxygen production will begin again). The value obtained by this process is the predicted fall in oxygen concentration in the pond. Subtracting the predicted fall from the second oxygen concentration reading will yield the predicted morning dissolved oxygen concentration. If the predicted morning concentration is 3 ppm or less, management steps (mechanical aeration or flushing) must be undertaken.<p>

Mechanical aeration by an electric or tractor driven aerator is one management tool for overcoming low oxygen concentrations in ponds. Flushing the pond with fresh water, if available, is another effective tool for increasing oxygen in the pond. Flushing also is effective for removal of ammonia, nitrites, and other undesirable chemicals. Mechanical aeration or flushing also is an effective means of destratifying or "breaking up" temperature-stratified ponds.<p>

The final, and perhaps most important, management tool is limiting feeding. Maximum feeding levels should not exceed 20 lb/ac/day if aeration is not available. Feed, as noted above, is the nutrient that drives the system. Limiting the amount of feed, and hence nutrients, will control phytoplankton abundance and decrease the like-lihood of oxygen and/or disease problems. If aeration is available and can be used nightly, feeding can be increased to a maximum rate of 100 lb/ac/day. However, a higher feeding rate requires more careful monitoring and management of the pond system.<p>

<h1>Prairie Dog Control in New Mexico</h1>
<h2>Guide L-201</h2>
<h3>James E. Knight, Extension Wildlife Specialist</h3>
Many ranchers and land managers in New Mexico have need of knowledge about prairie dog control. Quite often individuals begin a control program without complete knowledge about effectiveness, efficiency, environmental concerns, or proper timing of the various control methods. The purpose of this publication is to provide an outline of various methods available and advantages, disadvantages, and precautions for each.<p>
<h3>Pre-treatment Considerations</h3>
New Mexico is the home of the black-tailed and Gunnison prairie dogs. In general, black-tailed prairie dogs occupy most of the eastern half of the state, and Gunnison prairie dogs are found in the western half.<p>
One of the first considerations is to determine if you have a problem. Although prairie dog control may be necessary for health or other reasons, most control programs are undertaken because of the vegetation removed by the rodents. Prairie dogs clip and remove vegetation from the vicinity of their burrows. They eat the vegetation as well as cut it for nesting material. Prairie dogs apparently cut vegetation to maintain space and remove cover that might hide predators.<p>
Normally, if a rancher expects to economically justify a control program on the basis of the value of the vegetation that can be grown if prairie dogs are removed, at least 10-15 mounds per acre should be present. This means that if the prairie dog numbers do not result in 10-15 mounds per acre, the cost of treatment will usually outweigh the value of the vegetation that can be grown in the absence of prairie dogs. If, however, the prairie dog control is implemented to prevent or eliminate further expansion, other considerations besides vegetation in the existing prairie dog town may justify the control effort.<p>
It is important to know why the prairie dog problem exists. In some situations prairie dog colonies have always been a natural part of the ecosystems. In these semi-arid and short-grass prairie zones, prairie dogs will invade and flourish in spite of pasture management practices. In mid- to tall-grass prairies, heavy forage utilization by livestock may encourage establishment of prairie dog colonies. Rest rotation and light stocking rates can reduce potential prairie dog invasion.<p>
Before any prairie dog control effort, it is important to determine the effect on non-target animals. When using any pesticide, READ THE LABEL AND FOLLOW APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS.<p>
<h3>Control Methods</h3>
<h4>Toxicants</h4>
Toxicants are often the most practical and economical method for reducing or eliminating prairie dog colonies. Only strychnine and zinc phosphide baits are registered for prairie dog control in New Mexico. Zinc phosphide and strychnine are restricted-use pesticides and require certification for purchase and use. Contact your county Extension office for information on acquiring certification. Ready-to-use baits commonly contain the toxicant on good quality oats or oat grains. Zinc phosphide is also available in a pelleted form.<p>
Acceptance of baits and toxicants varies with weather, time of year, available food alternatives, amount of harassment of the prairie dog colonies, and other unknown causes. Both strychnine and zinc phosphide have flavor characteristics that may be disagreeable to prairie dogs. Zinc phosphide has a disagreeable odor as well as flavor. For this reason pre-baiting is extremely important.<p>
It is important to be able to evaluate conditions and apply control methods at periods of highest potential for effective control when using grain baits. Best times for control are:<p>
<ul>
<li>Early spring, immediately after the snow melt and thaw, during settled weather before green-up.
<li>Periods of dry settled weather when vegetation is dry and dormant.
<li>After August 1 when a significant shift in the acceptance of seeds and grains in the prairie dog diet has been noted. High competition for available forage during August and September often predisposes successful treatment.
<li>During fall when food resources are in short supply and animals are "feeding up" for winter fat storage.
<li>On black-tailed prairie dog colonies with limited space, over-crowding, and lack of food, treatment may be effective during periods of settled weather at any time of year. Early spring application is advantageous because prairie dog numbers are at the lowest point of the year. Less toxic bait is needed, reducing exposure to nontarget species and cutting down costs of bait and labor. Midsummer and early fall applications mean maximum bait distribution to highest prairie dog populations. The result could be a number of missed animals and a higher proportion of bait-shy animals remaining.<p>
</ul>
Again, to ensure a successful and safe control program, follow all label instructions.<p>
<h4>Fumigants</h4>
Fumigants cost approximately 5 to 10 times more per acre to apply than poison grain baits. They also require greater care and safety in application. Poison grain is usually 75-90% effective. Efficiency for aluminum phosphide is usually in excess of 95%. Gas cartridges provide efficiency of between 35% and 65%, but are convenient, relatively safe to use, and are not a restricted-use pesticide.<p>
Aluminum phosphide (Roton, Fumitoxin, or Phostoxin) comes in tablet or pelleted forms and can be applied into burrows with mechanical dispensers or by hand, using gloves. Then the hole is plugged tightly with sod. Gas cartridges ("smoke bombs") are ignited with a fuse by a match or lighter and inserted in the burrow. Then the hole is plugged tightly.<p>
Fumigants should be applied when prairie dogs are active and soil is moist. Moist soils apparently seal in the fumigant for a concentration high enough to provide a lethal dosage. Fumigation failures are most frequent in dry, porous soils. All fumigants except gas cartridges are restricted-use pesticides and require EPA private applicator certification to buy and use.<p>
Fumigants require at least twice the application time and labor as grain baits. Fumigant costs are 25 to 35 cents per burrow compared with 5 cents per burrow for grain baits.<p>
Nontarget animals within treated prairie dog holes normally are killed, but secondary kills do not occur. Surface animals usually are not affected. Fumigants are practical in places where nontarget wildlife mortality, public relations, and other considerations eliminate other methods. On large colonies, fumigation costs become excessive. A grain toxicant application followed up with an aluminum phosphide fumigation clean-up is the most practical control program.<p>
<h4>Traps</h4>
Conibear body grip or equivalent traps placed in burrow entrances work very well at killing prairie dogs. The investment in traps and time makes this option impractical for large colonies, but for 1- to 5-acre plots where time is not a consideration, these devices may be quite effective.<p>
<h4>Shooting</h4>
Consistent shooting of prairie dog towns can remove 65% of the population during the year. Annual shooting will cut down forage losses and slow down the invasion of new territory by prairie dogs. A consistent shooting effort is expensive in time and dollars, however, and rarely proves to be a practical form of control.<p>
<h4>Responsible Control</h4>
Those who undertake prairie dog control operations bear the responsibility for the safety of humans, the environment, and all nontarget animals that share the habitat.<p>
Burrowing owls are found in most parts of New Mexico. These rodent- and insect-eating birds live in burrows in prairie dog towns. Burrows that have feathers or white droppings at the mouth probably contain burrowing owls. There will not be any prairie dogs in the burrows the owls are using. Also be alert for black-footed ferrets. This very secretive animal depends almost entirely on prairie dogs for food.<p>
It is illegal to willfully kill a black-footed ferret. A thorough check should be made for evidence of ferrets inhabiting a prairie dog town before control is undertaken. Black-footed ferrets historically occurred in New Mexico; however, they were never plentiful and no verified sighting has been made in the state for many years. The most obvious distinguishing feature of a black-footed ferret is the black mask across the face. The long dirt ramp outside the burrow of prairie dogs is also characteristic. If you believe you have seen a black-footed ferret or sign of one, call the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish at (505) 827-7894.<p>

<h1>Mearn's Quail in New Mexico</H1>
<H2>Guide L-303</H2>
<H3>Charles Dixon, Extension Wildlife Specialist<BR>
Jim Knight, Extension Wildlife Specialist</H3>

<H2>HABITAT</H2>

Mearn's quail, Cyrtonyx montezumae, also known as Montezuma or Harlequin quail, are found in dense grass cover in mountainous parts of southcentral and southwestern New Mexico. These relatively unwary birds are often first noted when they explode suddenly in a frenzy of vibrating wings at close proximity. When Mearn's quail are present, they are often more abundant than people think because they tend to live in heavy cover and hide rather than run or fly as other quail do. A hunter will need a good bird dog to census or hunt these quail.<P>

<H2>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</H2>

Mearn's quail are about the same size as other New Mexico quail, about 8 to 9 1/2". Their coloration is a motley mixture of blacks, browns, and white, which provides excellent camouflage in the areas they inhabit.<P>

<H2>FEEDING HABITS</H2>

Their feeding habits differ from other quail, which generally feed on seeds and forbs. Studies show that Mearn's quail prefer underground bulbs and tubers of wood sorrel and nut sedges; insects are second; followed by grass and forb seeds. Their feeding areas can be identified by the small holes and cone-shaped excavations they make while scratching for bulbs and tubers. Mearn's quail sometimes eat large quantities of acorns, but these are probably an emergency food. Free water does not seem to be necessary for them to exist and reproduce.<P>

<H2>FACTORS AFFECTING POPULATION</H2>

Drought and overgrazing are believed to be the factors most detrimental to Mearn's quail populations. Drought is harmful because the bird's preferred plants grow best in areas that tend to be more moist than surrounding areas; overgrazing removes the dense grass cover these birds hide in and eliminates the plants that produce their preferred foods.<P>

This species nests later than other New Mexico quails, from early June through late September; therefore, Mearn's populations may benefit from a grazing system that rotates livestock out of areas where quail concentrate during nesting time. Proper grazing (where 50% or less of the current annual growth is taken) does not appear to be detrimental. However, especially in times of drought, heavy grazing during the growing season can eliminate Mearn's quail from an area. <P>

Severe and prolonged winter storms also cause population declines. Heavy snow and frozen ground prevent them from digging for food. Under these conditions, Mearn's quail rely on seed-retaining trees and large shrubs for emergency food.<P>

As with other quail, Mearn's populations usually depend on nesting success. Spring and summer moisture has a strong influence on hatches and chick survival. Although sufficient moisture is necessary for hatching, heavy rains shortly after hatching may lead to high chick mortality.<P>

<H2>MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS</H2>

Management information for Mearn's quail is extremely limited. A number of practices have been suggested but not tested. They are:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Defer grazing during the growing season.<P>

<LI>Plant food plots of chufa (nut sedges) in areas where Mearn's quail are found.<P>

<LI>Build fenced enclosures to enhance nesting and hiding cover.
</OL>
In general, Mearn's quail are a difficult species to manage. Even when quality habitat is maintained, uncontrollable factors may suppress the population. Likewise, winter populations may appear low, but a good nesting season and high chick survival will result in an abundant fall population.<P>

<h1>Scaled Quail Habitat Management</h1>
<h2>Guide L-304</h2>
<h3>Charles Dixon, Extension Wildlife Specialist<br>
James E. Knight, Extension Wildlife Specialist</h3>

Scaled quail, often called blue quail or cotton top, are native to the Chihuahuan desert and the surrounding grasslands of the southwestern portion of the United States and Northern Mexico. Their habitat is generally arid to semi-arid, averaging 8-15" of precipitation annually. They inhabit most of New Mexico in varying densities (except the higher-elevation, more mountainous areas). Scaled quail are swift afoot and often prefer to run rather than hide or fly. They tend to prefer areas that are open at ground level where they can use their running abilities. When flushed, they often fly a short distance, glide to the ground, and continue to run for some distance before they hide in whatever cover is available. Their running makes them difficult to hunt, for once a covey is located, they often disappear into the landscape, leaving a frustrated hunter.<p>
Scaled quail are like other quail, monogamous ground-nesting birds with the sexes similar in color. A successful nest will generally hatch 10-14 chicks. The nesting period may extend from May through September. As the young mature they tend to join with other family units to form winter flocks, generally from 20 to 200 birds. As winter progresses, the number of birds in the flock decreases from hunting, predation, weather-related deaths, and other causes. A first-year mortality of 70 percent or more is normal. In the spring the coveys break up and the birds pair up to begin the reproductive process again. Large fluctuations in population size are common from year to year and lowest numbers follow several years of drought.<p>
<h3>FOOD</h3>
Generally seed eaters, scaled quail usually feed in the early morning and late evening. Seeds remain a large part of the adult birds' diets year-round but fluctuate in the diet as seed availability fluctuates. Even when seeds are not abundant they are sought out by the quail and remain relatively high in the diet. Many different seeds are eaten by scaled quail. They prefer seeds from native woody plants and forbs, but seeds from grasses and field crops may comprise a considerable portion of the diet at times. Preferred seeds may include croton, bristlegrass, sumac, mesquite, sunflower, or ragweed. Snakeweed also has been found to comprise a large portion of the diet. This is probably in areas where it is relatively abundant and there are few alternative foods.<p>
Other foods important to quail are green herbage and insects. Green herbage makes up a larger portion of the diet in the winter and spring than in the summer and fall. Young nutritious plant shoots are important to quail preparing for the breeding season. Plant shoots are also an important source of moisture for quail. Insects are important, primarily in the spring and summer, as they are the primary food for hatching quail for the first 3-4 weeks of their life. Insects supply the high nutrition necessary for the growth and development of young quail but they also are an important nutrition and water source for adult quail. After the first month, plant material becomes increasingly important in the young quails' diets.<p>
<h3>COVER</h3>
Cover is an essential part of the scaled quail's habitat and lack of cover is a limiting factor over much of its range. Scaled quail use cover in several ways: daytime resting, hiding, escape, roosting, and nesting. A variety of types of cover are used, from small forbs and grasses to large woody plants and brush piles. <p>
Nesting cover may be the most important because nesting is when the quail are most vulnerable to predation. Nesting cover should offer concealment for the nest, but not be so dense that the nesting quail cannot escape when danger approaches. Without good nesting cover, nesting success will decrease. <p>
Daytime resting or loafing cover is also an important scaled quail habitat. Resting cover provides overhead and lateral protection, has a central vegetation-free area, and offers many avenues of escape. Good scaled quail habitat will consist of scattered pockets of this coverãabout one acre in ten. Mesquite, skunkbush, sumac, shinnery oak, cholla, and sandsage are examples of plants that provide loafing cover. Brush piles and abandoned buildings, corrals, and equipment may substitute for natural cover. If food such as mesquite beans, sumac berries, or the seeds of small forbs are closely associated with the cover, its value increases. Scaled quail routinely use a select few clumps of resting cover, spending much of their time mid-morning through mid-afternoon there.<p>
Closely associated with resting cover is hiding or escape coverãcover scaled quail seek when flushed from their resting cover. If they are then flushed from the hiding cover, they tend to fly farther and run farther before ducking into other hiding cover. The more pressure is applied, the more they tend to disperse. Hiding cover varies greatly, from grassy and herbaceous species to woody species and man-made structures. The structure of general escape cover cannot be described because scaled quail are opportunistic in the cover they choose for hiding, using heavier cover the more they are harassed.<p>
Another important type of scaled quail cover is roosting cover. These birds generally roost in groups of two or more, tail-to-tail in a tight circle on the ground. They prefer to roost on a substrate of bare ground; duff with grass less than 16" high for lateral cover. They roost among small shrubs, forbs, grasses, and other suitable cover. Roosting cover should be free of overhead cover to allow them to fly away easily when predators or other danger approach.<p>
<h3>WATER</h3>
Water is another consideration for scaled quail. Their water requirement is measured in drops instead of gallons, and they generally obtain enough water from their environment, via dew, succulent vegetation, and insects. Scaled quail tend to concentrate around water, and free water may become a critical factor for survival of young birds during dry times.<p>
<h3>GENERAL MANAGEMENT</h3>
It is important to consider quail and other wildlife when land management practices are evaluated. Quail need a habitat with a wide diversity of plant species. Though grama grass, broom snakeweed, or mesquite may all be a part of good scaled quail habitatãgrama grass for broods to forage for insects and light cover, broom snakeweed for emergency winter feed, and mesquite for cover and foodãan area with only one of these plant species is not a good scaled quail habitat. If mesquite is to be removed, leave some where quail are most often seen. The same should apply to treating broom snakeweed, shinery oak, and other woody and shrubby species. Heavy grazing can be detrimental to scaled quail habitat and be extremely harmful during nesting. Fencing can be an important wildlife management tool for scaled quail. It can be used to protect small areas (one acre or less) from grazing to provide resting cover, nesting cover, and brooding areas. Special management practices such as soil tillage or planting food plots, shrubby species, skunkbush, wildplum, Russian olive, and cholla cactus, can provide food and cover. Brush piles can provide cover where natural cover is lacking.<p>
Providing water or access to water can increase the survival of young scaled quail. Ideally, water should be provided at ground level, but ramps into and out of stock tanks can provide access to existing water and prevent drowning. <p>
Windmills often provide excellent opportunities to enhance quail habitat if the stock tank has an overflow with the waste water piped away from the drinking tub. To provide an effective area for scaled quail, fence approximately one-half acre where the waste water stands. Construct a brush pile in one corner to provide cover for the short run. Plant shrubs near enough to the water so they can obtain the extra water they need to become established. Strips can be disked inside the enclosure to allow a place for forbs to grow. In a few years the area should be a quail haven.<p>

Aquaculture, or fish farming, is a fast-growing industry in the U.S. This growth is due to several interrelated factors. First, commercial fishing is rapidly depleting wild stocks in the oceans. Second, edible fish and seafood per capita consumption has risen from 12.8 lb in 1980 to 15.9 lb in 1989, and is expected to reach 20 lb in 2000 (although current trends indicate a leveling between 16 and 17 lb). Finally, there was an estimated fish and shellfish trade deficit of $4.9 billion in 1990. The combination of these three factors has led to increased demand for fish and seafood products that cannot be met by the greatly depleted wild catch fisheries. Aquaculture, therefore, is growing to fill the market void created by the increased demand and wild stock depletion.<p>

New Mexico has unique environmental and biological resources that could be used to develop a viable aquaculture industry in the state. Approximately 15 billion acre-feet of saline water (2 ppt and greater salinity) are available for use in New Mexico. Saline water resources cannot be used for traditional agriculture or for drinking water, but can be used for aqua-culture. The wide array of climatic conditions found throughout the state can support a diversified and strong aquaculture industry.<p> 

This guide is designed to assist individuals seeking to learn more about aquaculture and aquaculture potential in New Mexico. The first section asks the reader to answer some simple questions to determine the suitability of aquaculture for him or her. Section two discusses the basic design and biological criteria which must be considered when selecting a site for an aquaculture enterprise. Section three is a review of the aquaculture status of various species found in New Mexico and the culture techniques that can be used to rear these species. Section four discusses the aquaculture potential of several non-native non-indigenous species in New Mexico. Section five divides New Mexico into regions based on estimated aquaculture growing season. Also in this section is a listing of species with potential for farming in each region. Section six gives potential yields for several species of fish and crustacea at different levels of management intensity. Finally, section seven briefly discusses the aquaculture successes in surrounding states and lists the addresses of several state and federal culture facilities that can be visited. A list of aquaculture-related trade and scientific publications also is given. The list includes subscription addresses and phone numbers. <p>
<br><br>
<h2>I. IS AQUACULTURE RIGHT FOR ME?</h2>

Aquaculture is a relatively new industry in the U.S. Many people in the industry have been successful while a greater number have failed. A common theme unites most failed aquaculture enterprises: failure of the investors and managers to honestly assess the viability of their enterprise prior to beginning their operation.<p>
 
Many investors are duped by unrealistic promises of success and the belief that the developer of the plan is knowledgeable. Developers often inflate the potential of the operation in order to attract investors and begin their farming operation. 
Reading unbiased published reports and asking people in the industry who are knowledgeable in the proposed venture about the viability of the proposal are good starting points for avoiding common pitfalls. Before beginning an investigation, however, there are some simple questions you should ask yourself to determine if aquaculture is appropriate for you.<p>
<br>
<h3>QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF</h3>

<h5><i>Am I a risk seeker or am I risk averse? </i></h5> 
Aquaculture, like most farming enterprises, is highly risky. Many variables must be controlled over a long period to produce a marketable crop. If control is not maintained, a crop can be lost resulting in substantial financial losses. Aquaculture market prices vary. This variation means the risk of possible financial loss is higher in aquaculture than in some other ventures.<p>

<h5><i>Do I like farming and business?</i></h5>
An aquaculturist is a farmer and a business person. Farmers must be willing to work long hours in all kinds of weather, as well as be dedicated to the crop and its successful production. A business person must be aware of where, when, and how to market the product to obtain the best price. If investors or bankers are funding the enterprise,  the manager must account for every dollar spent and be able to justify the expenditure.<p>

<h5><i>How large an operation do I want and how am I going to achieve that goal?</i></h5>
Every good business develops a business plan to answer this question. If you are an investor, ask to see the business plan and analyze it closely to determine its accuracy and the enterprise's viability. A safe operation starts small and builds on its successes. An enterprise that seeks to start full-scale with little or no preliminary testing will have a difficult start and may not succeed. It is also important to adjust the plan as the operation proceeds.<p>

<h5><i>How easily do I adapt to new technologies and a changing industry?</i></h4>  
Aquaculture is a young industry that is still in the process of developing techniques and production methods. A good manager is able to keep abreast of new technologies and to apply what others have learned. Because industry prices are constantly in a state of flux, a manager must be able to adjust the marketing plan to achieve the highest value for the farm's product(s). </i></h5>

<h5><i>Do I or the manager have the technical expertise to select a site that meets the biological criteria of the proposed species, as well as the engineering criteria needed to construct the required facility?</i></h5>
Aquaculture site selection is one of the most important aspects of planning an enterprise. A site must have acceptable water temperature, growing season, and water quality and quantity for the proposed species. The site also must be of the appropriate slope, soil type, and related engineering criteria to meet facility design requirements.<p>

<H5><i>Do I or the manager have the knowledge and skill to run the enterprise?</i></h5>  
Raising fish is not simply a matter of filling a hole with water and throwing in some fish. Managers must know fish production techniques, water quality, fish disease, fish nutrition, business management, and marketing. Managers must not only be able to produce a high-quality, reliable product but also must be able to market that product for a profit. A manager's qualifications can be determined by talking to references and people in the field who are familiar with the manager's reputation and abilities. Talk to the manager to determine how much he/she knows about the industry as a whole. A good manager will be able to discuss successes and failures of related operations, markets, and potential competitors.<p>

<h5><i>There also are preliminary financial questions that must be asked and answered: How much money do I have to invest?  How long can I wait for an acceptable return?  How do I define an acceptable return?</i></h5>
Aquaculture is a capital-intensive enterprise that requires a large initial investment. Returns to an investment will not occur for several years due to the time required for the production of a marketable crop. Aquaculture like many areas of farming, often provides investment returns in terms of the satisfaction of producing a crop rather than in financial terms.<p>
<br><br>
<h2>II. SITE SELECTION FOR AQUACULTURE IN NEW MEXICO</h2>
The site selected for an aquaculture enterprise will have a significant impact on the success of the operation. A site must meet the biological criteria for the species proposed, as well as the design criteria for the facilities required. Even the most skilled aquaculturist and business person can fail if the site selected does not meet these criteria.<p>
<br>
<h3>BIOLOGICAL AND DESIGN CRITERIA</h3>

<h4>Water Quality</h4>
The list of water quality components given in table 1 is not complete. However, testing for these factors with a portable water quality test kit will give an initial indication of the quality of the water for rearing fish. A complete analysis should be conducted to determine trace metal concentrations and other potential  toxicants. A full test can be obtained from the New Mexico State University Department of Agronomy and Horticulture's Soil, Water, and Air Testing Laboratory (Room 269 Gerald Thomas Hall, New Mexico State University; phone 646-4422) or by a commercial testing laboratory. Contact the testing laboratory prior to sampling to ensure proper collection and shipping procedures are followed.<p>

<h4>Water Quantity</h4>
A water budget must be created to determine the amount of water necessary for the proposed production system. Water budgets include the amount of water needed to fill the culture units: ponds, raceways, or tanks. Culture units will often be filled and drained several times during a growing season and each filling and draining must be included in the water budget. Budgets also must include water needed to compensate for poor water quality, water used to replace evaporative loss (a particular problem in New Mexico), and water used in incubating eggs and rearing fry (see Glossary) in the hatchery.<p>

If water is to be pumped from an aquifer to supply the facility, a survey of the aquifer and its contents may be necessary. The U.S. Geological Survey or the New Mexico State Engineers Office may be able to provide this information, as well as some general information concerning the output of wells in the area. Other well owners in the area may be able to give you a better indication of potential well outputs and the quality of the aquifer.<p>

If the water to be used will be derived from surface water sources, it is important to determine the seasonal supply and quality of those sources. It is also necessary to determine the abundance of wild fish in these sources and the methods to be used to prevent their entry into the planned facility.<p>

In New Mexico, rights to the use of water must be obtained by application to the State Engineer. In order to obtain water rights in New Mexico, potential users must show that they are diverting the water, putting it to beneficial use, and not impairing the rights of other water users. Additionally, to appropriate water (obtain water rights) there must be water available. Water supplies in New Mexico are limited. It may be necessary to purchase water rights from other users. These rights are an additional expense that must be considered in the overall business plan.<p>

<h4>Soil Quality</h4>
Soil is an important factor to consider when constructing an aquaculture facility. A facility constructed to rear fish in earthen ponds or raceways requires a soil composed largely of clay (minimum clay content of 20%) because clay soils hold water and prevent seepage better than other soil types. <p>

A soil analysis should be conducted to determine the trace metal concentration, pesticide concentration, and other chemical components that may affect fish. Soil analyses can be obtained from the New Mexico State University Department of Agronomy and Horticulture's Soil, Water, and Air Testing Laboratory or from a commercial testing laboratory. Contact the testing laboratory prior to sampling to ensure proper collection and shipping procedures are followed.<p>

Facilities using cement raceways or tanks are not as dependent on soil type. However, it may be necessary to construct effluent settling ponds. Depending on the water rights you have and applicable discharge laws, this settling pond may need to be constructed to hold water with little or no loss to seepage. Again, a clay soil may be needed.<p>

Pond liners may be used to avoid the requirement for specific soil types. Pond liners are an additional expense and may require specialized installation. These costs must be analyzed carefully to ensure the operation can support the additional expenses.<p>

<h4>Topography</h4>
Topography is another factor to consider when analyzing a potential site. Some facilities, particularly hill ponds, can be constructed in areas of rolling hills. However, many facility types require relatively flat ground with a slope of no more than 2 to 3%. 

<h4>Available Support Services</h4>
Aquaculture requires certain support services that may not be available at all locations in New Mexico. Some of these services include: construction services familiar with aquaculture, electrical service, all-weather access roads, fish feed and fertilizer suppliers, equipment repair and supply services, product markets, structures on the site (barns, homes, etc.), fish disease diagnostic facilities, qualified staff, and fingerling (see Glossary) suppliers.<p>

A site may meet all of the biological and design criteria but may be located in a place that has no available support services. It, therefore, may be necessary to pass over this location in favor of a less desirable site with greater access to these services.<p>


<h4>Permits</h4>
Each state has different requirements for constructing and operating fish culture facilities. Permits for  effluent discharge, water rights, building, propagation of game fish, and health must be obtained from the controlling state agencies. Depending on your facility and operational plans, additional permits may be necessary. In New Mexico, for example, it is illegal to import and rear live tilapia. An "Applications for Importation of Exotic Species" may be made to the New Mexico Game and Fish Commission to rear species prohibited in the state. <p>
<br><br>
<h2>III. FISH SPECIES IN NEW MEXICO AQUACULTURE</h2>

Fish species can be divided into three general categories based on preferred water temperature: 1) coldwater species, 2) coolwater species, and 3) warmwater species. Due to climatic variability, New Mexico has species from all three categories. The culture techniques used to rear each of these species are different: coldwater species are most frequently cultured at high densities in raceways; warmwater species are traditionally raised in ponds at slightly lower densities; and coolwater species are cultured in either system at varying densities.<p>

Below is a list of species with aquaculture potential and availability in New Mexico. Aquaculture status and methods of culture for each species are briefly described.<p>
<br>
<h3>COLDWATER SPECIES</h3>

<b>Kokanee salmon</b> (landlocked sockeye salmon) are found in seven waters within the state. Salmon are usually spawned in the fall or winter. Eggs are incubated in vertical tray incubators (see Glossary). Parr, or fry, are held in troughs with flowing water and fed artificial feeds. Feed-trained parr, or fingerlings, are moved to raceways and fed artificial feeds for rearing to market size. Stocking density for grow-out depends on fish size, water temperature, rate of water flow, desired growth rate, and water quality. Kokanee salmon can be reared in the saline water resources found in New Mexico.<p>

Markets for salmon are nationwide. U.S. salmon production was approximately 19 million pounds in 1992 and had an estimated value of $57 million. Small producers, therefore, will have to compete with large coastal producers. Small producers must differentiate their product(s) from the coastal product(s) and/or develop reliable niche markets.<p>
 
<b>Rainbow trout </b>are found throughout New Mexico. Culture methods for rainbow trout are similar to those used to rear kokanee salmon. Fish are spawned in the fall or winter, eggs are incubated in vertical tray incubators, and raceways are used to grow-out fingerlings. Water quality and quantity requirements also are similar to those of kokanee salmon. Techniques for rearing brown trout, brook trout, and lake trout are similar to those described above. Trout, like salmon, can be cultured in New Mexico's saline water.<p>

Markets for rainbow trout are nationwide. Large quantities of food-sized rainbow trout are raised in Idaho, California, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania. Production in 1992 was valued at $53 million. Small producers will need to niche market and differentiate their product(s). Markets for stocking rainbow trout in private sportfish ponds also exist.<p>
<br>
<h3>COOLWATER SPECIES</h3>

<b>Striped bass, white bass, and hybrid striped bass</b> are reared either in raceways or, more usually, in ponds. Domesticated broodstock have not been developed. Broodfish must be captured from the wild and induced to spawn via hormone injection (see Glossary). In New Mexico, anecdotal evidence indicates brood striped bass may be available from Elephant Butte Reservoir.<p>

Hybrid striped bass (commonly known in New Mexico as wipers) are a cross between striped bass and white bass. Hybrid striped bass are raised in ponds at stocking rates between 3,000 and 4,000/ac. Higher stocking rates are used for the fry-to-fingerling grow-out phase. Aeration and artificial feeds are used for intensive production. Striped bass and hybrid striped bass can be reared in saline water.<p>

A growing market is developing for hybrid striped bass as foodfish (see Glossary). A strong market also exists for fingerling striped bass, white bass, and hybrid striped bass for stocking in sportfish ponds. <p>

<b>Northern pike</b> can be found in eight waters in New Mexico. Northern pike are highly valued as a sportfish. Culture of this fish has been conducted primarily by state and federal hatcheries for stocking public waters. However, interest in intensive culture of this species as a foodfish has grown and appears to be possible.<p>

Broodstock are normally collected from the wild and spawned in the hatchery, either naturally or by hormone injection. Eggs are incubated in vertical tray incubators and fry are transferred to tanks or troughs for feed training. Feed-trained fingerlings are then transferred to raceways for grow-out to market size.<p>

Due to the culture status of this species, no consistent market is known. Fingerlings can probably be sold to state and federal agencies for stocking and mitigation purposes (i.e., to replace stocks lost due to human activities). Based on the demand by anglers for this species, a foodfish market probably exists.<p>

<b>Yellow perch</b> are found in the impoundments of the major drainages of New Mexico. The species is a prized sportfish. Yellow perch culture is limited primarily to state and federal hatcheries. Intensive culture techniques have been developed, but foodfish markets for this species appear to be limited to the North-central U.S. This region supports a commercial fishery in the Great Lakes for yellow perch.<p>

Intensive culture techniques for yellow perch require natural spawning, stripping (see Glossary), or induced spawning broodstock. Eggs are incubated in vertical tray incubators and fry are cultured to fingerlings in fertilized ponds. Eighty percent of fingerlings greater than one inch in length can be trained to accept artificial feeds. Market size (0.33 lb) can be obtained in 12-15 months depending on temperature and photoperiod.<p>

<b>Walleye</b> are found in the impoundments of the major drainages of New Mexico. Walleye are a prized sportfish and foodfish. Walleye culture requires collecting pre-spawning adults from the wild and stripping eggs in a hatchery facility. Eggs are incubated in McDonald jars (see Glossary). Fry can be stocked in fertilized ponds for growth to fingerlings or offered artificial feeds immediately while held in troughs. Poor survival (> 30%) can be expected when artificial feeds are used for rearing fry. Foodfish culture is limited by fingerling survival. <p>

Markets for this fish may be available, but little market research exists. Fingerlings may have great value for stocking sportfish ponds and possibly for mitigation purposes.<p>

<b>Smallmouth bass</b> are present in most of the major drainages in New Mexico. Smallmouth bass culture is restricted primarily to fingerling production. Spawning is most frequently conducted in ponds. Gravel nests are placed around the edge of the broodfish pond and spawning occurs naturally. Fry are collected before swimming-up off the nest and transferred to fertilized nursery ponds. Fingerlings are harvested in approximately thirty days at a size of one to two inches. Intensive smallmouth bass culture using artificial feeds is possible but has not been shown to be economically feasible.<p>

Fingerling smallmouth bass are a valued commodity in some states for stocking sportfish lakes. Other market opportunities may be found in mitigation projects.<p>
<br>
<h3>WARMWATER SPECIES</h3>

<b>Channel catfish</b> are found throughout New Mexico. Aquaculture of this species is conducted in many states in the U.S., including Texas and Arizona. Channel catfish are spawned by placing spawning cans in broodstock ponds. Eggs are collected from the cans and incubated in paddlewheel troughs (see Glossary). Fry are stocked in fertilized nursery ponds and fed artificial feeds through grow-out. Research conducted in New Mexico indicates saline water found in the state can be used to rear catfish.<p>

Market size for channel catfish is one pound. In the Southeast where catfish culture is conducted on a large scale, the break-even price (i.e., the price to cover all costs) is approximately $0.55/lb. Strong markets exist nationwide for channel catfish, but large production from the Southeast means other producers must differentiate their product(s) and find niche markets.<p>

<b>Largemouth bass</b>  are one of the most highly sought after sportfish in the U.S. Largemouth bass are present in all of the major drainages of New Mexico except the Tularosa Basin. Production is limited to fingerlings due to difficulties in training largemouth bass to artificial feeds. Like smallmouth bass, largemouth bass are spawned in ponds. Fry are removed and stocked in fertilized ponds for culture to two to three inches.<p>
 
Fingerlings are usually sold to private pond owners for sportfishing. Additional markets may include state and federal agencies. Prices for fingerling largemouth bass are high. Prices for larger fish increase significantly but losses to cannibalism also are high, limiting production.<p>

<b>Bluegill</b> are found throughout New Mexico. Bluegill are traditionally used as a forage base for largemouth bass in sportfish ponds. Fingerlings are produced through natural spawning in ponds. Bluegill can be easily trained to accept artificial feeds.<p>

Fingerling bluegill are marketed to private pond owners. Little market is available for food-sized bluegill. Potential may exist to rear bluegill as foodfish, but little research has been conducted in this area.<p>

<b>White crappie</b> are found throughout New Mexico except in the Tularosa Basin. At this time, crappie culture is limited to fingerling production. Research, however, has shown that crappie can be trained to pelleted feeds suitable for use in grow-out to foodfish.<p>

Broodfish are collected from the wild and may be spawned naturally in ponds or by stripping in the hatchery. Eggs collected by stripping are incubated in McDonald jars. Fry from either spawning method are reared in fertilized ponds to a minimum size of one inch. Feed training can be initiated at this time with grow-out culture in ponds or raceways. Significant care should be taken when transferring or transporting crappie because they are highly sensitive to any handling.<p>

Markets are available for fingerling crappie. A foodfish market is not yet feasible due to the difficulty in rearing large numbers in intensive systems.<p>

<b>Crayfish</b>, or crawdads, are found throughout New Mexico in irrigation ditches, rivers, and ponds. Crayfish are cultured extensively in shallow ponds in Louisiana and Texas. Crayfish frequently are double-cropped with more traditional agricultural crops (e.g., rice). <p>

Crayfish are spawned in the culture pond and offspring are allowed to grow on natural or artificial forage to a marketable size with the brood crayfish remaining in the pond. Harvesting is conducted with baited traps.<p>

Markets for crayfish exist in many areas of the U.S., but competition from Louisiana and Texas producers will make product differentiation and niche marketing important to any New Mexico producer. <p>
<br><br>
<h2>IV. NON-NATIVE NON-INDIGENOUS SPECIES WITH AQUACULTURE POTENTIAL IN NEW MEXICO</h2>

New Mexico has a large number of fish species with aquaculture potential. There also are several non-native non-indigenous, or exotic, aquaculture species with proven potential that could be raised in New Mexico. These species include tilapia, the Chinese carps, and penaeid shrimp. This section will discuss, in general terms, the culture methods and markets for these exotic species.<p>

It is important to note that culture of exotic species in New Mexico is controlled by the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish. An "Application for Importation of Exotic Species" must be made to and accepted by the Department prior to importing or beginning culture of any non-native non-indigenous species.<p>

<b>Tilapia</b> are similar in appearance to bluegill. Tilapia were imported from Africa to many parts of the world. Production of tilapia is centered in the southern U.S., the Caribbean, and Central America. In the U.S., tilapia also are cultured in colder climates using indoor recirculating systems or geothermal spring water.<p>

Tilapia are a warmwater fish. They are disease resistant, tolerant of poor water quality, and grow well in most aquaculture systems. Culture methods ranging from open ponds to cages to water recirculating systems have been used to rear tilapia successfully. Tilapia also have been cultured successfully in saline water.<p>

Tilapia will reproduce in most aquaculture systems. Reproduction is both a benefit and a hinderance to production of this species. It is a benefit because fingerling production is simplified. It is a hinderance because tilapia spawn frequently. The high spawning frequency slows growth and the increased fish mass due to the fry in the culture unit leads to stunting in the population.<p>

Markets for tilapia are growing worldwide. U.S. tilapia production in 1991 was approximately 9 million pounds and has increased steadily since that time. Producer markets are available in niche markets or, if production is large enough, in larger outlets. <p>

<b>Chinese carps</b> are, as their name implies, native to Asia. Carps traditionally cultured include: bighead carp, silver carp, common carp, grass carp, and mud carp. In China, where these fish were first cultured, all carp species are reared together in a single pond. This system of culture is called "polyculture". Polyculture yields can be higher than those obtained in monoculture systems. Polyculture of carp with other species, including tilapia, has been successful.<p>

The Chinese carps are warmwater to coolwater species. Reproduction is by hormone injection and eggs are incubated in McDonald jars or zug jars (see Glossary). Fry are reared in fertilized ponds. Artificial feeds can be used to rear these fish to foodsize in ponds. Carp also can be cultured in raceways with artificial feed.<p>

Markets for foodsize carp are limited to ethnic markets in large cities. Interest in canning bighead carp to compete with canned tuna has developed and may prove to be a viable market. Larger markets for foodsize carp in the U.S. are limited by consumer dislike for the large number of bones found in the flesh of carp. Grass carp, however, are a high-value fish. Grass carp are used to control aquatic weeds in many ponds and lakes throughout the U.S. This use has created an increasing market for grass carp.<p>

<b>Penaeid shrimp</b> are cultured in Texas, Central and South America, Japan, Thailand, and along the coast of Asia. In Texas, penaeid shrimp are cultured along the Gulf coast and in west Texas. West Texas shrimp culture uses saline groundwater from the Permian Basin to supply grow-out ponds.<p>

Penaeid shrimp are cultured in warmwater ponds. Post larvae (PLs) are stocked into ponds and fed artificial feeds. Spawning is usually conducted in more controlled environments (e.g., indoor tanks). U.S. shrimp culture, therefore, is divided into two parts: hatchery and grow-out. Hatchery operations supply PLs to producers worldwide, while grow-out facilities provide foodsize shrimp to the worldwide market.<p>

Markets for shrimp are worldwide. Declining wild stocks are increasing the demand for farm-raised shrimp. In turn, the increased demand for farm-raised shrimp has increased the demand for PLs. <p>
<br><br>
<h2>V. WATER TEMPERATURE REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW MEXICO FISH SPECIES</h2>

New Mexico has a wide array of climatic conditions: mountains, deserts, and river valleys. The aquaculture species to rear in New Mexico, then, are dependent on climatic conditions at the proposed site. <p>

Table 2 outlines the overall and optimum temperature ranges of selected aquaculture species. A map dividing the state into regions defined by estimated monthly average water temperature and estimated growing season also is provided (fig. 1). Water temperatures were determined using measurements collected by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Army Corps of Engineers on the reservoirs they control in New Mexico. Average temperatures, therefore, may be cooler in the summer months and warmer in the winter months than those observed in a small, shallow aquaculture pond. However, the observations will provide an indication of water temperatures that can be expected in each region. Each region also is described briefly in terms of its aquaculture potential and a list of possible aquaculture species for the region is given.<p>

<h3>REGION DESCRIPTION AND POTENTIAL AQUACULTURE SPECIES LIST</h3>

<b>Region 1</b> encompasses the northern portion of New Mexico. The growing season and temperatures are best suited to coldwater species: kokanee salmon, rainbow trout, and other trout species. Some coolwater species (e.g., northern pike) may also be cultured in the southern portion of this region. The region has significant water resources with good potential for aquaculture development. <p>

<b>Region 2</b> covers the middle portion of the state. The temperatures and growing season are best for coolwater species: striped or hybrid striped bass, walleye, yellow perch, and others. Some warmwater species also can be cultured in the southern reaches of this region (e.g., channel catfish). The majority of New Mexico's population is found in this area. Therefore, it may be difficult to obtain water resources. Some saline water resources are available in the region. <p>

<b>Region 3</b> includes the area around Santa Rosa where artesian springs produce an abundant and constant flow of 61°F water. The region, therefore, is best suited to coolwater species: striped and hybrid striped bass, northern pike, yellow perch, and others. The constant water temperature provides a year-round growing season. <p>

<b>Region 4</b> is situated in and around the Gila National Forest. Water temperature and growing season are most appropriate for coldwater species: kokanee salmon and trout. However, limited private land ownership and the presence of the endangered Gila trout in the area may limit aquaculture development.<p>

<b>Region 5</b> includes the southern and most of the eastern portion of New Mexico. This region is best suited to the culture of warm water species: channel catfish, largemouth bass, bluegill, crayfish, and possibly penaeid shrimp. Significant saline water resources can be found throughout this region.<p>

<b>Note:</b> Variation will occur in each region depending on exact location. The map and information given above should only be used as a guide. Each proposed aquaculture site must be analyzed independently.<p>

<h2>VI. EXPECTED YIELDS FOR AQUACULTURE SYSTEMS IN NEW MEXICO</h2>

Yield of an aquaculture system is limited by a series of factors. As each of these factors is overcome by the appropriate management technique, yield increases until the next limiting factor is reached. Yield of an aqua-culture system, therefore, depends on the level of management intensity. <p>

Aquaculture systems can be managed at levels ranging from no management to intensive management. No management, or extensive culture, entails stocking fish into a pond and allowing fish to feed on natural forage in the water. Yield obtained from this system is limited by the food supply in the water. The next level of management intensity entails feeding formulated, complete feeds. Yield with feeding will increase significantly over that obtained in the extensive culture system. Adding aeration to the feeding system will overcome low oxygen content in the water and allow for a further increase in yield. Finally, yields can be increased through intensive management of the aquaculture system. Here, complete feeds are used, aeration is applied, and poor water quality is overcome by flushing water through the system. Yield and management input will be high at this intensive level of culture. <p>

Different levels of management can be observed in aquaculture situations seen throughout New Mexico. Extensive culture is exemplified by private sportfish ponds stocked at a low level and used for private fishing. Pond culture of fish with feeding, and occasionally aeration, is practiced at the Dexter National Fish Hatchery in Dexter, N.M. The intensive level of culture is observed at state hatcheries, where rainbow trout are cultured in raceways with complete feeds and continuous water flow.<p>

Yields given in table 3 represent averages obtained from research at various locations. Yields in New Mexico will vary depending on water quality and the culture system used. These yields, however, can be used as a basis for planning.<p>

<h2>VII. AQUACULTURE SUCCESSES, FACILITIES TO VISIT, AND PUBLICATIONS</h2>

Aquaculture has been very successful in many states in the U.S. Mississippi is probably the best known example of successful aquaculture development. However, states closer to New Mexico also have developed strong aquaculture industries.<p>

Texas has a diversified aquaculture industry throughout most of the state, producing catfish, crayfish, sportfish fingerlings, and marine shrimp. Aquaculture in Texas is a $20-million-dollar industry that is projected to reach $1.5 billion. <p>

Arizona is another state close to New Mexico that has taken advantage of aquaculture to strengthen its agricultural sector. Arizona's industry produces catfish, trout, sportfish fingerlings, tilapia, and crayfish. One focus in Arizona is integration of aquaculture and traditional irrigation farming. Farms devoted strictly to aquaculture, however, are seen in Arizona.<p>

<h1>Safe Use of Household Greywater</h1>
<h2>Guide M-106</h2>
<h3>Revised by Marsha Duttle, Extension Research Assistant</h3>

Greywater is water that has been used for washing dishes, laundering clothes, or bathing. Essentially, any water, other than toilet wastes, draining from a household is greywater. Although this used water may contain grease, food particles, hair, and any number of other impurities, it may still be suitable for reuse. Reusing greywater serves two purposes: it reduces the amount of freshwater needed to supply a household, and reduces the amount of waste water entering sewer or septic systems.<p>
The New Mexico Environment Department and the Construction Industries Division govern liquid waste disposal in New Mexico, and issue permits for approved systems. Greywater use is restricted by the Liquid Waste Disposal Regulations (LWDR), but the Environment Department can grant a variance if the applicant shows that:<p>
<ol>
<li> "granting the variance will result in public health and environmental protection equal to or greater than the minimum protection provided by the varianced requirement" (LWDR section 202.D.2.); and<p>

<li> "the proposed liquid waste system will, by itself or in combination with other liquid waste systems, neither cause a hazard to public health nor degrade any body of water" (LWDR section 202.D. 1).<p>
</ol>
Note: Be sure to obtain all necessary permits before installing a greywater system.<p>


<h3>USES FOR GREYWATER</h3>

The amount and quality of greywater will in part determine how it can be reused. Irrigation and toilet flushing are two common uses, but nearly any non-contact use is a possibility.<p>
Greywater is suitable for irrigating lawns, trees, ornamentals, and food crops. Though irrigation methods in greenhouses may differ greatly from outdoor irrigation, several guidelines for use of greywater apply to both situations.<p>
<ul>
<li>Apply greywater directly to the soil, not through a sprinkler or any method that would allow contact with the above-ground portion of the plants.<p>

<li> Root crops which are eaten uncooked should not be irrigated with greywater.<p>

<li> Plants that thrive only in acid soil should not be watered with greywater, which is alkaline.<p>

<li> Use greywater only on well-established plants, not seedlings or young plants.<p>

<li> Disperse greywater over a large area, and rotate with fresh water to avoid buildup of sodium salts.<p>
</ul>
In addition, when irrigating outdoors, apply greywater only to flat areas where runoff is not likely. A cloth bag attached to the end of the hose will help distribute water and also act as an additional filter. The filter will need to be removed and cleaned periodically (every three or four days).<p>
In arid areas where dry grass or brush pose a fire hazard, homeowners may wish to plant a firebreak or "greenbelt" of a selected high-moisture species. Greywater is ideal for irrigating firebreaks, because it contributes plant nutrients in the process.<p>
Remember that in most areas outdoor irrigation is a seasonal use for greywater, but greywater is produced throughout the year. If reverting to sewer or septic systems during the winter is not feasible, find uses that are possible during all seasons.<p>
Toilet flushing can use considerable amounts of greywater, as it normally accounts for up to 50% of indoor water use. Poor quality greywater is not a problem if it is used to flush toilets, because the water goes into the sewer or septic system where it would have gone had it not been reused. Greywater should be pumped into the toilet bowl for flushing. <b>DO NOT </b>put greywater into the toilet tank. Greywater in the tank may not only cause the flushing mechanism to malfunction, but could be backsiphoned into the fresh water supply if water pressure decreases suddenly. <p>
Lagoons or ponds containing greywater can grow algae to feed fish in a separate pond, or provide food for ducks and other waterfowl. Removal of the algae is necessary to keep the system aerobic and prevent foul odors. Ponds are often lined with concrete, stone, or plastic to prevent leakage. This method is a relatively inexpensive and easy way to recycle water, but requires some expertise to site and construct the lagoons.<p>
With an automatic clothes washer, the wash water from a lightly soiled load, or rinse water, can be saved to wash the next load. When reusing laundry water for irrigation, do not use liquid fabric softener or detergents including softener (use softener sheets in the dryer instead). Water should not be reused if the laundry includes diapers. Wash water containing gasoline, diesel, or similar pollutants, should not be used for purposes other than flushing.<p>


<h3>UNTREATED GREYWATER</h3>

Untreated greywater should not be kept for longer than one day, but adding two tablespoons of chlorine bleach per gallon of water will extend storage time somewhat. Try to use greywater the day it is collected or the high bacteria count will cause objectionable odors.<p>
Observe these precautions when using untreated greywater:<p>
<ul>
<li> Greywater containing sodium, bleach or borax can damage plants. For this reason, water from automatic dishwashers should not be used for irrigation.<p>

<li> Water used to wash cooking utensils in the sink may contain grease, fats and oils, and is not acceptable for greywater use.<p>

<li> If you plan to use water from your washing machine, avoid liquid fabric softeners and detergents with softeners. Use a dryer fabric softener sheet instead.<p>

</ul>
<h3>TREATING GREYWATER</h3>

Investing time and equipment in a system designed to filter, store, and possibly disinfect greywater may make water reuse a more convenient practice. Some questions to answer before building a treatment system are:<p>
<ul>
<li> How much greywater will have to be treated? About 65% of domestic wastewater is greywater. Bathing and laundry can generate considerable quantities of greywater in a large household.<p>

<li> What contaminants are present? Greywater from the bathroom will have different characteristics than that from the kitchen (see figure 1).<p>

<li> What are the possible uses after treatment? The planned uses of greywater may call for more or less treatment. Some uses, such as outdoor irrigation, are seasonal; greywater is produced year round.<p>

<li> What is the soil type and depth to water table at your site? A shallow water table underlying sandy soil could be in danger of contamination.<p>
</ul>
Answering these questions will help you decide what type and size of system to install. Because greywater treatment systems are not much in demand, you may have to design and build a system to meet your own specifications and needs. Options to consider for greywater treatment include settling tanks, disinfectants and filters.<p>

<h3>Tanks</h3>

In a settling tank, solids and large particles will settle to the bottom, while grease, oils, and small particles will float. The remaining liquid will be reused. A settling tank also allows hot water to cool before reuse. The tank should be large enough to hold twice the expected dally flow plus 40 percent, to allow for sludge accumulation and surge loading. One type of settling tank well-suited for greywater treatment is a septic tank. A septic tank is specifically designed to allow settling, but do not confuse the use of a septic tank to treat greywater with the conventional use of a septic tank. Greywater intended for reuse should NEVER be mixed with toilet wastes.<p>
Greywater coming out of a septic tank contains little or no oxygen. Greywater from an aerobic tank will contain more oxygen, which is better for irrigation purposes. An electrical pump or aerator added to a septic tank can create an aerobic environment. Aerobic conditions allow some decomposition of wastes in the tank, and may help minimize sludge buildup and blockages in the system. Both aerobic and septic tanks will need to be pumped Out every three to five years.<p>
Several types of tanks may be suitable for settling or storage of greywater. In addition to metal, polyethylene, fiberglass or wooden tanks that are commonly used, consider using plastic garbage cans, 55-gallon dims, portable swimming pools, or waterbed mattresses.<p>

<h3>Disinfection</h3>

Two chemicals used to disinfect water are chlorine and iodine, with chlorine being more common. Not only is it readily available (as household liquid bleach or at swimming pool supply houses) and relatively inexpensive, but it is stable in storage and will, in time, vaporize from the water after disinfection. Organic material in greywater may combine with chlorine, and reduce the amount available for disinfection. For this reason, a filter or settling tank before the disinfection point may be advisable.<p>
Iodine is less affected by organic material, persists longer, and may be more effective at the high pH of greywater. Iodine is also fast-acting, requiring no more than two minutes to kill most pathogens.<p>
Several devices are available commercially that dispense appropriate amounts of iodine or chlorine (in solid or liquid form) to a water system. Check with swimming pool supply houses or water treatment companies.<p>

<h3>Filters</h3>

The type of filter required for a greywater system depends largely upon the amount of greywater to be filtered and the type of contaminants present. A drain filter is an easy and inexpensive way to filter lint and hair Out of bath or laundry water. A simple cloth bag tied over the end of a hose or pipe may be sufficient for irrigating outdoors or similar applications.<p>
Many types of commercial water filters are available. Most use an activated charcoal, cellulose, or ceramic cartridge that must be cleaned or replaced regularly. Before buying a filter, determine whether it is a gravity filter (for low volumes) or a pressure filter (for flow rates greater than 20 gallons per minute). Also consider the frequency, cost, and ease of maintenance.<p>
Slow sand or multi-media filters are usually built by the homeowner. These gravity filters may be constructed in a 55-gallon drum or similar container that is of suitable size. Features that should be part of a filter include a perforated plate or some other device to distribute water evenly over the top, a concrete funnel in the bottom to help water drain to the perforated drain pipe, and a cover and vent to prevent odors. Fill the bottom of the filter with stones that are too large to enter the drain pipe.<p>
Slow sand filters are shallow layers of stone, medium gravel, and pea gravel beneath a deep layer of sand (see figure 2). A slow sand filter will treat approximately 0.05 to 0.13 gallons per minute per square foot of surface area.<p>

Multi-media filters are filled with a variety of media in order of increasing size, for example, fine sand, coarse sand, gravel, stone, and wood chips, to a total depth of 2 1/2 to 3 feet (see figure 3).<p>

NOTE:  Figures 2 and 3 are not available.  Please see PDF file or contact NMSU Agricultural Communications for a hard copy.<p>

Slow sand filters require regular cleaning and replacement of the top layer of media. Multi-media filters require less frequent cleaning, but all layers must be cleaned or replaced when maintenance is required. Routing greywater through a settling tank before filtering reduces contaminant load and can lengthen the interval between cleanings.<p>

<h1>Pecan Harvesting Equipment:  Owning Equipment Versus Hiring a Custom Operator</h1>
<h2>Guide M-111</h2>
<h3>R. Patrick Sullivan, Extension Economic Development Specialist</h3>

The costs associated with owning and operating farm machinery continue to play a critical role in determining farm profitability. Owning additional machinery allows growers to complete field and harvest operations quickly, but this advantage may be offset by the fixed costs associated with owning machinery used for only a limited number of hours during the production cycle. On the other hand, not having enough equipment to perform tasks in a timely manner can reduce yields and result in missed marketing opportunities.<p>
Tables 1 and 2 describe basic equipment requirements for 200-acre and 25-acre pecan orchards. The equipment is considered typical and does not represent the specific requirements for any individual farm. Furthermore, costs reflected in this report are strictly estimates and should only be used as a guide. These estimates do not reflect the costs for any given individual.<p>
<h3>FIXED AND VARIABLE COSTS</h3>
Costs can be categorized in various ways, but for the purpose of this analysis, costs will be grouped as either fixed, variable, or semi-variable.<p>

<h4>Fixed Costs</h4>
Fixed costs (as the name implies) do not vary with the amount of output. These costs remain constant during the production cycle regardless of the level of output. For example, the fixed costs associated with owning a tractor are the same regardless of whether the tractor is used 1 hour to produce 2,000 lb of nuts or 300 hours to produce 100,000 lb of nuts. Depreciation and taxes are examples of costs that are usually fixed.<p>
Fixed costs can be either cash or noncash costs. Cash outlays that would be made regardless of the amount of output would be considered fixed cash costs. A typical example of fixed cash costs would be property taxes. Fixed noncash costs include costs that over time result in either cash or a missed opportunity, but that are not cash expenses in the short-run or production cycle. An example of noncash fixed costs is depreciation, where the original cost of an asset is allocated over its useful life.<p>
<h4>Variable Costs</h4>
Variable costs (also known as operating costs) include fuel, lubricants, repairs, and the expense for custom operations. These costs typically result in cash outlays during the production cycle and will vary in amount depending on use.<p>
<h4>Semi-Variable Costs</h4>
Semi-variable costs have elements of both fixed and variable costs and can be either cash or noncash. Costs such as labor, management, and certain overhead costs do not vary directly with production. However, these costs will vary depending on the number of acres. They also may be fixed over a small range, but additional units are needed as production or acreage increases over a larger range.<p>
<h3>OWNING EQUIPMENT VS. HIRING A CUSTOM OPERATOR</h3>
There are basic equipment items, such as tractors, disks, and trucks, for which ownership is usually necessary to perform day-to-day operations (table 2). However, there are specialized pecan harvesting equipment that may or may not be owned by the individual operator, including a shaker, sweeper, and harvester (table 1).<p>
Harvesting equipment is used only for a limited number of hours during the production cycle; therefore, acreage must be sufficient to offset the high fixed costs associated with ownership if a custom operator is not being used.<p>
In analyzing the economic feasibility of owning harvest equipment, the individual operator must determine the level at which fixed and variable costs associated with ownership are less than the cost of a custom operator. Total per-hour fixed costs associated with harvest equipment rank high among the equipment listed (table 1). Therefore, it is important to recognize that as acreage decreases, total per-hour fixed cost will increase.<p>
Annual variable costs for a shaker, sweeper, and harvester range from $13 to $66; $45 to $305; and $89 to $434 respectively for acreages ranging from 10 to 50 (table 3). Semi-variable costs range from a low of $338 at the 10-acre level to a high of $1,691 at the 50-acre level (table 4). Fixed costs remain the same at each acreage level (table 5).<p>

The cost to custom shake, sweep, and harvest pecans was estimated at three different yield assumptions (1,500, 1,750, and 2,000 lb/acre) and five different acreage assumptions (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 acres) (table 7). The rate was based on a sliding scale depending upon yield and ranged from $0.14 per pound at 2,000 lb/acre to $0.18 per pound at 1,500 lb/acre. The rate was estimated for each of the acreage levels.<p>

Table 8 compares total ownership costs to custom costs for each acreage and yield assumption. Ownership would become feasible at the acreage level where custom costs exceed total ownership costs. Using these cost estimates as a guide, ownership becomes a feasible alternative at approximately 40 acres.<p>

All equipment decisions regarding ownership, leasing, or custom work should be carefully evaluated based on the individual operator's goals, objectives, and resources. Each alternative has both advantages and disadvantages. Ownership allows for convenience of use that might result in higher yields or improved marketing opportunities. The down side to ownership is that high fixed costs may destroy profitability. Leasing may very well result in the best of both worlds, offering both convenience of use and no fixed costs. However, it is very unlikely that an operator would be able to lease specialized equipment on the short-term basis that would be required for profitability. Hiring a custom operator eliminates both the large capital outlay and ownership costs associated with purchasing equipment. The greatest disadvantage to using a custom operator is the grower is at the mercy of the custom operator's scheduling, as delays in harvesting can lead to reduced yields and missed marketing opportunities.<p>

<h1>Water Quality for Livestock and Poultry</h1>
<h2>Guide M-112</h2>
<h3>Craig Runyan, Extension Water Quality Specialist<br>
Jeff Bader, County Extension Agent</h3>

Water is a critical nutrient to all livestock and poultry. As with feed ingredients, livestock water should meet the nutritional needs of the animal. Most minerals and dissolved solids found in water provide nutritional benefits when present within limited concentration ranges. This guide outlines the recommended limits of certain substances commonly found in water used for livestock and poultry.<p>
With the exception of the salinity recommendations, these standards do not discriminate between animals raised for slaughter or those kept for breeding or pleasure. It is possible that animals maintained for long periods on water of marginal quality would be at risk of developing related health problems. Slaughter animals, which are kept for relatively shorter periods, would be less likely to develop health problems from water of the same quality.<p>
Without proper blood and tissue tests, it is difficult to determine that animal health problems are caused by mineral toxicity, because of the complex metabolic interactions of dietary minerals. Toxicity from a specific mineral or compound is a function of its concentration and relative levels of other components with which it interacts. The concentrations below indicate general water quality conditions and possible related health problems—they should not be used as sole diagnostic indicators.<p>
<h3>Salinity</h3>
Salinity, or the total soluble solids content of water, is a problem commonly found in arid regions such as New Mexico. Treatment to reduce salinity is possible, but would require regular maintenance and may not be economically feasible for remote watering locations.<p>
Suggested salinity level limits for different classes of livestock are as follows:<br>
<i>Less than 1000 milligrams per liter (mg/l).</i> Considered low. Excellent for all classes of livestock and poultry.<p>
<i>1000-2999 mg/l.</i> Very satisfactory for all classes of livestock and poultry. Temporary, mild diarrhea in livestock or watery droppings in poultry may be noticed in animals not accustomed to this level of salinity.<p>
<i>3000-4999 mg/l.</i> Satisfactory for livestock; poor water for poultry. Livestock not used to saline water may refuse it or have temporary diarrhea. In poultry, watery droppings, increased mortality, and increased morbidity associated with poor growth may occur. Turkeys are particularly susceptible.<p>
<i>5000-6999 mg/l.</i> Marginal quality for beef cattle, sheep, swine, and horses. Water this saline should not be used for pregnant or lactating animals, and it is not suitable for poultry.<p>
<i>7000-10,000 mg/l.</i> Considerable risk for pregnant or lactating cows, horses, sheep, or immature animals of any class. Avoid use for all animals if possible; however, older animals may subsist on water of this quality under certain conditions.<p>
<i>Over 10,000 mg/l.</i> Because of high risks associated with such saline water, regard it as unusable under any condition.<p>
<h3>Elements and Compounds</h3>

Levels of nitrates, metals, and other elements in water are also important to consider for livestock and poultry suitability. For each component, the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) indicates the uppermost limit at which water should be considered safe to use. MCLs are given in milligrams per liter (mg/l). Some water testing results may report these substances in parts per million (ppm). For practical purposes, mg/l can be considered numerical equivalent to ppm.<p>
<i>Selenium</i>: MCL 0.05 mg/l. Selenium is not commonly a problem; however, certain areas in New Mexico have high levels of selenium in the soil, which could cause high levels in ground water. Too much selenium can cause "blind staggers" or "bob-tailed disease," leading to loss of mane and tail in horses, switch of cattle, and body hair of swine. Affected animals may recover if removed quickly from the contaminated source.<p>
<i>Fluoride</i>: No MCL is given, although a limit of 2.0 mg/l is recommended. Fluoride interacts with copper in dietary minerals. Excessive levels can cause loss of tooth enamel, resulting in rapid, uneven wear. Secondary effects disturb metabolism, causing semi-starvation conditions.<p>
<i>Arsenic</i>: MCL 0.02 mg/l. Elevated levels can produce antibiotic-like effects such as growth stimulation (as with medicated poultry feeds). Arsenic is, however, stored by the body and can reach chronic toxicity levels, causing death.<p>
<i>Copper</i>: MCL 0.5 mg/l. In combination with phosphorus, copper plays a role in bone development. Ruminants are more susceptible to copper toxicity. Problems with copper can occur when dietary molybdenum is either excessive or deficient.<p>
<i>Nitrate</i>: No MCL is given. Nitrate contamination of well water is often caused by poor wellhead protection from animal waste. High nitrate levels may also indicate high levels of biological pathogens (bacteria that can cause gastrointestinal disease). Recommended MCLs are 100 mg/l of nitrate-nitrogen plus nitrite-nitrogen, or 10 mg/l of nitrite-nitrogen alone. Excessive nitrate/nitrite intake can lead to problems in fetal development.<p>
<i>Cadmium</I>: MCL 0.05 mg/l. Cadmium is considered very toxic. High levels in the diets of poultry have caused egg production to cease. In young animals, increased dietary intake of cadmium can cause anemia. Reproductive problems related to cadmium have been observed in most livestock classes.<p>
<i>Boron</i>: MCL 5.0 mg/l. Little scientific information on livestock boron intake is available. Slower growth rate is known to be one of the effects of too much boron in livestock water. Higher levels (150–300 ppm) can cause inflammation and edema in the legs of cattle, causing subsequent weight loss.<p>
<i>Chromium</i>: MCL 1.0 mg/l. Carbohydrate metabolism in animals requires dietary chromium. Chromium toxicity from diet has been studied very little and is not considered a serious problem. Symptoms of elevated chromium intake varies among classes of animals, but primarily appear as skin and soft tissue problems.<p>
<i>Lead</i>: MCL 0.1 mg/l. It is unusual to find lead in natural waters. Studies indicate pregnant goats will abort fetuses as a result of moderate levels of lead intake. In poultry, egg production has been shown to decrease from increased lead intake.<p>
<i>Mercury</i>: MCL 0.01 mg/l. Mercury is not essential to animal nutrition and is not readily absorbed. Mercury can cause acute poisoning, much the same as arsenic. In cattle and sheep, dietary intake of 0.2 mg/kg mercury will cause uncoordination, unsteady gait, and eventual death. Mortality in poultry begins with mercury levels of 5.0 ppm.<p>
<i>Zinc</i>: MCL 25 mg/l. Normal growth and development of all animals requires adequate levels of dietary zinc. Levels of 40–100 ppm zinc in the diet are normal.<p>
<h3>Water Testing</h3>
Have your well water tested annually. Owners of private wells can have their water tested by collecting a sample themselves or hiring a qualified person. The sample should be taken to a certified laboratory for analysis. For water testing labs nearest you, contact the local county Cooperative Extension Service office.<p>
If water test results do not meet the recommended quality standards, take steps to determine the source of the problem. The county Extension agent or a qualified private water quality consultant can assist in locating and correcting the cause. Another resource is Extension's New Mexico Farm*A*Syst--Farmstead Assessment System. This is a self-administered groundwater protection program that helps identify problem areas and recommends solutions.<p>

<h1>Septic Tank Maintenance</h1>
<h2>Guide M-113</h2>
<h3>R. Craig Runyan, Extension Water Quality Specialist</h3>

A septic tank is an underground sewage-collection system. The tank itself is a watertight container constructed of a sound, durable material resistant to corrosion or decay.<p>
When choosing a septic tank, your selection should be determined by the number of bedrooms or fixture units to be served. New Mexico Plumbing Code requires the following septic tank sizes:<pre>
__________________________________________________________________________________
Single family			Minimum septic tank size
dwelling size			in gallons
_________________________________________________________________________________
0–2 bedrooms			750
3 bedrooms			1000
4 bedrooms			1200
5–6 bedrooms			1500
__________________________________________________________________________________
</pre>

<h3>How Does a Septic Tank Work?</h3>
As the septic system is used, there is an accumulation of solids in the tank, which is sometimes referred to as sludge. The septic tank removes solids by holding wastewater in the tank for at least 24 hours, allowing the solids to settle and scum to rise to the top. This is accomplished by a series of baffles inside the tank. Up to 50 percent of the solids retained in the tank will decompose over time. Treated effluent water discharges from the tank to perforated drain pipes. From there, it drains to a constructed absorbtion or “leach” field. The effluent eventually percolates through the subsoil to groundwater.<p>
<h3>Septic Tank Maintenance</h3>
As you use your septic system, sludge will accumulate in the tank. Properly designed tanks have enough space for up to three years of safe accumulation. Once the sludge has reached this level, the separation of solids and scum no longer takes place, and sewage may overflow into the absorption area. This can be prevented by periodically pumping the accumulated sludge.<p>
<h3>How Often Should You Pump? </h3>
This depends on the following:<br>
<li>Capacity of septic tank
<li>Flow of wastewater
<li>Volume of solids in wastewater<p>
Volume of wastewater flow is determined by the type and frequency of common household activities. Water conservation practices in the home will help to limit the flow into the system. Use of an in-sink garbage disposal will increase the volume of solids. Care should be given to the type and amount of solids disposed of through a garbage disposal.<p>
Table 1 gives the pumping frequencies according to the size of the septic tank. Please note that biological and chemical septic tank additives are not necessary and do not eliminate the need for pumping.<p>

Note:  More frequent pumping needed if garbage disposal is used.<p>
<h3>Safe Use of Septic Systems</h3>
Do not put substances such as motor oil, gasoline, paints, thinners, and pesticides in drains. These materials may pollute the groundwater and are toxic to the microorganisms that maintain an active septic system.<p>
Moderate use of household cleaners, disinfectants, detergents, or bleaches will do little harm to the system, but remember that where there is a high density of septic systems there may be a cumulative impact on groundwater from household cleaners.<p>
Fats, grease, coffee grounds, paper towels, sanitary napkins, disposable diapers, and other such items will clog your septic system.<p>
<h3>Protect the Absorption Field</h3>
Keep automobiles and heavy equipment off the absorption field.<p>
Grass cover and shallow-rooted plants are beneficial over the absorption field, but the deep roots of trees and shrubs stress and may plug nearby drain tiles. Do not fertilize the soil above the drain field.<p>
Grass on the surface of an absorption field should be mowed regularly to promote evaporation and removal of water through the leaves. This helps prevent water from unnecessarily infiltrating the soil above the absorbtion field.<p>
<h3>Conserve Water</h3>
Remember to consider the capacity of your septic system when installing new appliances or plumbing.<p>
Limit the water entering the tank. Use water-saving fixtures. Repair toilet float valves, leaks, and dripping faucets.<p>
<h3>Avoid Septic Tank Additives</h3>
Yeasts, bacteria, enzymes, and chemicals are sold with the claim of helping septic systems work better; however, there is no scientific evidence that additives are effective. In fact, some cleaners allow the solids in an overloaded tank to be re-suspended and clog the drainage lines.<p>
Additives are not an alternative to proper maintenance and do not eliminate the need for routine pumping of a septic tank.<p>
Commercial biological additives are not necessary for restarting decomposition after pumping because the sludge residue contains active microorganisms.<p>
<h3>How to Recognize Problems</h3>
Learn how to recognize problems with septic systems. For example, unusually lush and green grass over your drain field may indicate trouble. Also, pay attention to slow-draining toilets or drains, sewage odors, or sewage backing up into the house or over the drain field.<p>
<h3>Checklist for Good Septic Tank Maintenance</h3>
<li>Check your system annually for leaks and sludge.<p>
<li>Have your septic tank pumped by a licensed pumping contractor.<p>
<li>Practice water conservation. Repair leaky faucets and toilets. Spread clothes washing over the entire week, and operate only with a full load of  laundry.<p>
<li>Learn the location of your septic systems. Make a map and keep it handy.<p>
<li>Keep a maintenance record.<p>

<h1>A Low-Cost Water Measuring Device</h1>
<h2>Guide M-226</h2>
<h3>Zohrab Samani, Associate Professor*<br>
Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</h3>

Measuring water in open channels is a basic element of water conservation. With the increasing demand for improved water management techniques, there is a serious need for low-cost and accurate water-measuring devices. Ever since the development of the Parshall flume, attempts have been made to simplify the construction and improve the accuracy of water-measuring devices in open channels.<p>
The circular flume is an appropriate device for measuring flow through furrows because its circular shape fits to the natural shape of a furrow, reducing the possibility of lateral flow around the flume. The device also has been used successfully in lined and unlined canals.<p>
High costs have prevented the use of water measuring flumes by growers. However, recently a practical water measuring device has been designed that can be used by growers at low cost: the circular flume.<p>
The circular flume is a simple device made of two pieces of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, one installed vertically inside the other (fig. 1). The diameter of the inner column should be approximate one-third of the flume's diameter (0.25 to 0.32). The inner column reduces the cross-section of the flow, creating a critical flow condition. A gauge at the upstream side of the inner column (figs. 1 and 2) measures the depth of the water upstream of the critical flow section.<p>
(NOTE: Figures 1 and 2 not available.  See PDF file or contact NMSU Agricultural Communication for a hard copy.)<p>
<h3>FLUME CONSTRUCTION</h3>
The device is designed to create a critical flow by reducing the flow's cross-section. A 2-ft length flume can be constructed from PVC pipes or a combination of PVC and corrugated pipes. For small water courses such as furrow or small streams, flumes are normally constructed from PVC pipes. For larger streams, where the availability of large PVC pipe is limited, the flumes are constructed from a combination of corrugated metal pipes and PVC pipes.<p>
<h4>1. Furrows and Small Streams (< 100 gpm)</h4>
 To construct a simple circular flume for measuring flows in a furrow or in a small stream, use a 2-ft section of 6" nominal size schedule-40 PVC pipe and a 1-ft section of 2" schedule-40 PVC pipe. Cut a 2" hole in the 6" pipe, and install the 2" pipe vertically inside the 6" pipe. Install the vertical pipe 1.5 ft from the entrance of the 6" pipe (fig 1). Round the bottom end of the 2" pipe so that it can fit easily inside the 6" pipe. Install a gauge at the upstream side of the inner pipe to measure the depth of the flow. Cut a notch at the top of the 6" pipe upstream of the gauge to facilitate reading. Once flow depth is measured, flow rate can be calculated using the calibration table. The depth of the water can also be measured inside the 2" pipe by a 0.5" perforation at the top of the pipe. Measuring the flow depth inside the 2" pipe is preferable because it reduces fluctuation. If the flume is installed in a dirt ditch or furrow, construct a cutoff sheet (2' x 2' sheet aluminum) at the upstream end of the flume to avoid lateral water seepage.<p>
<h4>2. Circular Flume for Flow > 100 gpm </h4>
For higher flow rates in either dirt ditches or lined canals, make 4-ft-long flumes with vertical column installed 3 ft downstream of the flume entrance. Install a gauge to measure the flow depth at the upstream side of the vertical pipe. The flow depth can also be measured inside the vertical pipe by creating a 1" perforation on the upstream side at the bottom of the vertical pipe. Normally both the gauge and perforation are used, the gauge for direct observation and point measurement, the perforation for continuous depth measurement inside the column using a float chart or a data logger. For flumes larger than 24", construct the main pipe from 16 gauge corrugated metal pipe and the column pipe from PVC. Tables 1-4 are calibration tables for 6-12-18- and 36-inch flumes, respectively.<p>
<h3>SUBMERGENCE</h3>
For proper operation, the flume should be submerged at a minimum level where the depth of the water downstream of the column divided by the depth of the flow at the gauge is less than 0.85. If this ratio is more than 0.85, raise the flume enough to reduce this ratio.<p>

<TITLE>Applying Anhydrous Ammonia in Irrigation Water</title>

<h1>Applying Anhydrous Ammonia in Irrigation Water</h1>
<h2>Guide M-304</h2>
<h3>Elston K. Grubaugh, Extension Agricultural Engineer</h3>

Anhydrous ammonia is a relatively inexpensive source of nitrogen and can be distributed in irrigation water, but <b>at present is not recommended for sprinkler systems.</b><p>
<h3>Ratio of Anhydrous Ammonia to Water</h3>
The ratio of anhydrous ammonia to water should not exceed 100 parts per million (ppm). In some highly alkaline water this ratio should not exceed 50 ppm. Thus, a well producing 1,000 gallons per minute could carry approximately 55 pounds of anhydrous ammonia per hour while highly alkaline water should not carry more than 25 to 30 pounds per hour for each 1,000 gpm of water used.<p>
<h3>Anhydrous Ammonia in Hard Water</h3>
Most irrigation water in New Mexico contains considerable calcium and magnesium salts. When anhydrous ammonia is injected into water, the pH of the water is raised. This causes precipitation of calcium and magnesium carbonates, which are the white, solid deposits that form on ditch banks and inside siphon tubes and gated pipe. Precipitation can be prevented by injecting an inhibitor called sodium polyphosphate into the water ahead of the anhydrous ammonia. This can be bought in supermarkets and from fertilizer dealers under the trade name Calgon. Suggested rates of NH3 application and amounts of inhibitor required are shown in table 1.<p>
Water can be analyzed for hardness in ppm or grains per gallon by sending samples to the Soil and Water Testing Laboratory, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM  88003.<p>
<h3>Injecting Ammonia into a Closed-Pipe System</h3>
A manifold injection pipe is necessary inside the irrigation pipe to dissipate the pressure of the anhydrous ammonia. The pipe can be approximately 3/8-inch in diameter and about 2 feet long with 1/8-inch holes drilled in it every inch. The ammonia pressure is great enough to overcome water pressures used in gated pipe. A similar manifold pipe can be used in an open irrigation ditch. The NH3 flow can be regulated with a flow meter bought from a fertilizer dealer. An automatic shutoff device should be installed in the NH3 injector line to stop the NH3 flow in case the irrigation water stops running.<p>
<h3>Injecting Inhibitor into Irrigation Water</h3>
In a siphon-tube system, the inhibiting agent mixed in water can be dripped into the stream at the rates suggested in table 1 with a constant flow valve. In a gated-pipe system, the inhibitor will have to be injected under pressure to overcome the water pressure in the gated pipe. This will require an injector pump.<p>
<h3>Information Needed for Field Calculations</h3>
<ol>
<li> Time for irrigation in hours.<br>
<li> Acres covered by one irrigation set.<br>
<li> Quantity of nitrogen needed per acre.<br>
<li> Irrigation water hardness.<br>
<li> Flow rate of irrigation water.<br>
<ol>
(a) injection rate of nitrogen per hour<br>
(b) injection rate of inhibitor per hour<p>
</ol>
</ol>
<b>Example:</b><ol>
<i>Given:</i><p>
<li> Time of irrigation is 6 hours.<p>
<li> Area covered in one irrigation set is 5 acres.<p>
<li> Quantity of nitrogen per acre is 30 pounds.<p>
<li> Flow rate of well is 1,000 gpm.<p>
<li> Irrigation water hardness is 35 ppm.<p>
</ol><ol><i>Answer:</i><p>
<li> Multiply acres in set by pounds of nitrogen needed per acre. <p>
Example ã 5 acres x 30 pounds per acre = 150 pounds nitrogen.<p>

<li> Anhydrous ammonia is 82% nitrogen. Dividing 150 pounds nitrogen by 82% = 183 pounds anhydrous ammonia.<p>

<li> Rate of injecting anhydrous ammonia is 183 pounds divided by hours of irrigation.<p>

Example ã 183 pounds anhydrous ammonia divided by 6 hours = 30.5 pounds of anhydrous ammonia per hour. This is below the 37 pounds per hour rate (table 1) that anhydrous ammonia can be injected into 1,000 gpm of water flow with a water hardness of 35 ppm.<p>
<li> Rate of injecting inhibitor is 0.25 pounds per hour (table 1) for 1,000 gpm flow of water with hardness of 35 ppm for 6 hours of irrigation.<p>

Example ã 0.25 pounds inhibitor per hour x 6 hours = 1.5 pounds inhibitor.<p>
<li> Table 1 and our example use a water flow of 1,000 gpm. For different water flow rates, use the percent of 1,000 gpm. If a well is pumping 850 gpm, use 85% of the quantities in table 1. If the flow is 1,500 gpm, use 150% of the quantities.<p>
</ol>
<h3>Irrigation Procedure</h3>
Make a trial irrigation set with no nitrogen, using the largest furrow stream size possible. Get the water through the field in not more than 6 hours on low intake rate soil (clay) and not more than 3 hours on high-intake rate soil (sands). Record the time of irrigation.<p>
On the next set, start the injection of inhibitor and anhydrous ammonia when water is started through the field. When the water reaches the bottom end of the field (6 hours), the inhibitor and anhydrous ammonia will all be injected into water.<p>
Flush out the irrigation system for an additional 15 minutes after stopping the fertilizer and inhibitor injections. <p>

<H2>WHAT ARE THE GUIDELINES FOR THIS RULE?</H2>

Labels of agricultural pesticides will require compliance with the WPS. Pesticide companies are modifying labels to include WPS requirements. Labels on over 8,000 products must be changed. Each modified label will include an Agricultural Use Requirements stating, "Use this product only in compliance with its labeling and with the Worker Protection Standard, 40 CFR," plus other references to the WPS. Pesticide companies must put the new label on their products by April 21, 1994. After October 23, 1995, agricultural pesticides cannot be sold without the WPS references.<P>


<H2>WHAT DO I NEED TO DO FOR MY AGRICULTURAL WORKERS AND PESTICIDE HANDLERS?</H2>

When you use pesticides with WPS labeling, you must comply with specific label requirements. You must observe restricted entry intervals, assure that your pesticide handlers use label specified personal protective equipment, and notify workers about applications when the label requires both oral and posted notification (only for pesticides in the most toxic category).<P>

On and after April 15, 1994, additional requirements are needed. Your workers and handlers must receive pesticide safety training. You must post information about pesticide applications in a central location. You must provide decontamination sites with soap, water, and single-use towels for workers, and one clean change of clothing for handlers. You must also notify employees (orally or by posting) about all pesticide applications. There are additional WPS requirements and specific exceptions to these requirements that are detailed in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) manual, "The Worker Protection Standard for Agricultural Pesticides--How to Comply."<P>


<H2>WHERE CAN MY WORKERS/HANDLERS AND I RECEIVE TRAINING?</H2>

Training programs will be offered by different organizations and agencies. Most state Cooperative Extension Services will offer training primarily for handlers. Worker or handler training can be done by a certified applicator. Once trained, workers and handlers do not have to be retrained for 5 years.<P>


<H2>WHEN MUST TRAINING BE DONE?</H2>

On and after April 15, 1994, pesticide handlers must be trained before they do any handling task using a pesticide with a WPS label. Workers must be trained before they accumulate 16 separate days of entry into treated areas where, within the last 3() days, a pesticide has been applied, or a restricted entry interval has been in effect. The 16-day period changes to 6 days for workers after October 20, 1997. The 16 days (6 days) need not be consecutive and may occur over several seasons of employment.<P>


<H2>WHERE CAN I GET MORE INFORMATION?</H2>

Every county Extension Agent should have information on WPS for you to study. The agent will also have a copy of the EPA manual, "How to Comply." The New Mexico Department of Agriculture will also have information, as well as your chemical dealer, commodity groups, and Farm Bureau.<P>


<H2>WHY DO I NEED TO DO THIS?</H2>

Because it's the law is not the only reason. You, your family, and workers are the key to agricultural production in this country. When there is a pesticide accident and someone is injured, some people think the only answer is to take that pesticide off the market. Let's all practice pesticide safety  not only to protect ourselves, our family, and workers against harmful pesticides, but also to safeguard the use of these chemicals for agriculture.<P>

<H2>DEFINITIONS:</H2>

A list of pecan accumulators, buyers and shellers trading in New Mexico is presented in table 1. The Tracy-Luckey firm has its main office in Albany, Georgia and maintains a Las Cruces office with one full-time buying agent. The buying agent estimates annual production by traveling through the state in May and June to examine the nut set. Once a rough estimate of total production has been made, the buyer meets with individual producers and makes a verbal agreement to purchase the producer's entire crop at harvest. After harvest, the nuts are taken to the Las Cruces office to be weighed, cleaned, sized and graded.<p>

The producer is paid at this time. The pecans are put in cold storage where they remain until shipped by truck to Tracy-Luckey's shelling facilities in Hickman, Kentucky or Harlem, Georgia, or to the inshell cleaning and polishing facility in Albany, Georgia. Tracy-Luckey also custom shells small lots of pecans at the Las Cruces facility.<p>

Azar Western Pecan Growers conducts business in much the same manner as Tracy-Luckey, except that Azar's processing facilities are located in El Paso, Texas.<p>

S & J Pecan Company accumulates small lots of pecans in the Roswell, Pecos River and Tularosa areas of New Mexico. S & J does not contract with producers, but buys pecans on a cash basis with payment at delivery. S & J also does custom shelling of small pecan lots. Most pecans bought and shelled are sold at the retail level in the Roswell area. About 20% of the pecans are marketed on a mail order basis.<p>

McRea and Son of Yance, Texas has a Las Cruces area buying agent who accumulates small and intermediate pecan lots from Mesilla Valley producers. A local buyer uses a written contract to buy pecans from producers stating that McRea & Son <p>

will buy a farmer's entire crop at harvest. There are no specific amounts of pecans nor a price stated in the contract. After harvest, the pecans are hauled at the farmer's expense to a Las Cruces warehouse to be sampled, weighed and loaded for truck shipment to a shelling facility in Yace, Texas. The pecans are shelled and repacked for retail and wholesale distribution throughout the United States. McRea and Son usually pays farmers for their pecans within one month of delivery.<p>

Wardy Nut Company of El Paso, Texas buys pecans throughout New Mexico. Although both large and small lots of pecans are purchased, only verbal agreements to purchase entire crops are made. Pecans are hauled to El Paso at the producer's expense to be weighed and graded. Most of the pecans purchased are shelled and repackaged for retail and wholesale trade in the El Paso area. Wardy also sells unshelled pecans to local retail and wholesale outlets.<p>

Stahmann Farms, Inc. grow, shell, grade, package and distribute all their pecans. Stahmann Farms had pooling arrangements before 1979 with local farmers to buy and market their pecans. Since that time, the firm has ended all pooling agreements and is processing and shelling only its own pecans. Stahmann Farms has developed an orchard in Australia and harvests a pecan crop there, as well as the New Mexico crop.<p>

Communication with lenders is one of the main problems faced by farmers and ranchers, especially as agriculture moves away from being a self-contained, labor and land-intensive industry, and toward a business-oriented, capital-intensive industry. As agriculture moves in this direction, farmers and ranchers must become fluent in the language used by bankers and other businessmen. As with any other profession, businessmen use a language filled with jargon, words that have become a style of shorthand with exact definitions. These words minimize the amount of verbiage needed to explain what is meant and minimize misunderstanding.<p>
Farmers and ranchers have their own shorthand, including such words as heifer and anhydrous. Usually these words are well known to individuals familiar with agriculture, but not necessarily understood by others. Lenders and businessmen also use their own language. Following are some of the most common business terms and definitions applicable to the farm and ranch.<p>

<b>Accrual Accounting</b> -- A system of accounting which recognizes income and expenses when they are effectively earned or incurred, rather than when cash changes hands. Under accrual accounting, grain produced during the year is counted as income in that year, regardless of whether it was sold or stored. Farmers and ranchers may choose to maintain their records and file taxes using accrual accounting methods, but publicly-owned corporations are required to use this system.<p>

<b>Accrued Liability</b> -- A liability which has been incurred but not yet paid. For example, if mortgage interest is to be paid annually on February 1, 11 months of interest would have accrued by January 1 although the cash payment is not yet due.<p>

<b>Amortized Loan</b> -- A loan in which the amount borrowed is repaid in installments over the term of the loan.<p>

<b>Annual Percentage Rate</b> -- Often referred to as APR, it reflects the interest and noninterest costs associated with a loan expressed on an annual percentage. APR may differ substantially from the contractual interest rate stated on the note.<p>

<b>Annuity </b>-- A series of payments of a fixed amount covering a specified number of years.<p>

<b>Appreciation</b> -- The long-term increase in value of an asset due to inflation, other economic conditions or an increase in demand for that asset. If, for example, land or corporate stock is valued above what was paid for it, the asset is said to have appreciated.<p>

<b>Asset </b>-- Any item which is owned. Full value of land or of stored grain is classified as an asset, regardless of whether there is a mortgage or lien on that property.<p>

<b>Audit</b> -- A check of business record books or tax returns for accuracy and completeness.<p>

<b>Average Costs</b> -- Average cost is a concept related to the production function and related cost curves, and represents average cost per unit of output. Average cost is defined as total costs divided by output, which is total variable costs plus total fixed costs divided by output.<p>

<b>Average Physical Product </b>-- Average physical product is a concept related to the production function and represents the average amount of output produced by a given amount of variable input, i.e., output divided by input.<p>

<b>Balance Sheet</b> -- A statement of all items of value owned (assets); the claims against those assets, including debts owed (liabilities); and the owner's net worth or equity at a specific point in time. The balance sheet is also called a net worth or financial statement.<p>

<b>Basis</b> -- A term used in income tax preparation and valuation of assets. The basis of an item generally refers to the value of cash and other assets paid for the item when originally purchased. Adjusted basis or depreciated book value or cost basis are all terms which refer to the value of an asset calculated by subtracting depreciation taken from the purchase price.<p>

<b>Book Value</b> -- The cost of an item less its accumulated depreciation allowances.<p>

<b>Bookkeeping</b> -- Keeping track of income and expenses for income tax, credit application or management analysis purposes. Records provide the necessary basis for all forms of business analysis.<p>

<b>Budget</b> --  A written estimate of future income and expenses covering a definite time period. Budgets can take several different forms, such as a partial budget, a cash flow budget, a whole farm budget or others, depending upon the need or decision to be made. Regardless of form, each budget is a projection into the future which should be used as a plan or a guideline.<p>

<b>Capital</b> -- As used in capital assets, capital investments, capital improvements; to describe money (owned or borrowed) invested in anticipation of a return.<p>

<b>Cash Flow</b> -- Actual cash coming into or going out of the business.<p>

<b>Cash Flow Budget </b>-- A written estimate of projected cash income and outgo for a definite period. It is usually prepared on an annual period, by months, showing cash receipts, expenditures and cash needed or surplus for each period. Most lending agencies require a cash-flow budget to help them plan their own cash flow needs.<p>

<b>Consolidated Financial Statements</b> -- Financial statements (Balance Sheets, Income Statements, Cash Flow Statements) which combine business and personal items, including assets, income and sources of funds.<p>

<b>Constructive Receipt</b> -- A tax term that describes pro ceeds from sales that may not yet be converted to cash or deposited in a bank account, but nonetheless are available. A common example is a check received for sale of a commodity in late December, but not cashed until January. Those proceeds are included in December receipts and are taxable in that year, regardless of when the check was cashed or deposited.<p>

<b>Contingent Liability</b> -- A liability or debt incurred only if some specific event should occur, such as the sale of an asset or business.<p>

<b>Credit</b> -- Money borrowed with the understanding that it wili be repaid. Alternatively, credit may be referred to as the amount of money that can be borrowed, i.e., a credit reserve.<p>

<b>Credit Rating</b> -- A judgment of an individual's ability to handle credit based on past performance, assets owned, repayment capacity, character and other factors.<p>

<b>Credit Risk</b> -- The risk assumed by the lender that the borrower will not repay a loan.<p>

<b>Credit Worthiness</b> -- The proven ability of a borrower to use and repay borrowed funds.<p>

<b>Current Asset</b> -- An asset which is or may be converted to cash easily (a liquid asset such as stocks and bonds), one which will be sold within 1 year (such as grain in storage, feeder livestock or a cull cow), or one with a useful life of less than 1 year (such as a prepaid expense or supplies and feed).<p>

<b>Current Liability</b> -- A liability which will be paid off within 1 year, such as an operating loan, interest accrued on a long-term loan and due within 1 year, principal due within 1 year or an accrued income tax liability.<p>

<b>Debt</b> -- An obligation owed to another. Alternatively, debt refers to the total sum of money owed to others.<p>

<b>Depreciation Expense </b>-- Annual accounting charge for the deterioration, obsolescence or wear of an asset whose productive life is more than 1 year. Although depreciation is not paid in cash, it is an expense to the business because the entire purchase price of a long-lived asset cannot be deducted in any 1 year. According to Internal Revenue Service definitions, depreciation was replaced by the Accelerated Cost Recovery System for all assets purchased after December 31, 1980.<p>

<b>Disposable Income</b> -- The amount of net income left after taxes.<p>

<b>Enterprise Analysis</b> -- An analysis of costs and returns specific to each crop and livestock commodity produced on the farm or ranch.<p>

<b>Enterprise Budget</b> -- A detailed listing of projected prices, yields and costs associated with a specific crop or livestock commodity.<p>

<b>Equity</b> -- The part of an asset or an entire business owned outright by the operator. For example, equity in a business is the value of the business less the amount owed. Sometimes expressed as percent of ownership.<p>

<b>Expenditures</b>-- All items of cash outflow. Most expenditures are also business expenses, but others (such as the purchase of a machine or principal payments on a loan) are not.<p>

<b>Expenses </b>-- Annual costs incurred in doing business, whether paid in cash or not. Many expenses are also expenditures, but others (such as depreciation) are not.<p>

<b>Financial Statement </b>-- Usually refers to a Balance Sheet, although it may include all financial statements such as the Income Statement and Cash Flow Budget.<p>

<b>Fixed Costs</b> -- Expenses that do not vary with level of production, such as depredation and personal property taxes. For example, personal property taxes are the same on a tractor, regardless of whether that tractor is used on 1 acre or 300 acres, or is not used at all.<p>

<b>Gross Margins</b> -- A concept used in developing the Whole Farm Plan. Gross margins are income over variable costs, i.e., Gross Receipts minus Variable Costs.<p>

<b>Gross Returns</b> -- Total cash receipts from an enterprise, i.e., total yield times price or weight of cattle times price.<p>

<b>Income </b>-- Money or increased value of inventory earned. An accrual accounting concept, income reflects money earned from commodities produced or services rendered, regardless of whether that commodity was actually sold on the market or payment was received.<p>

<b>Income Statement </b>-- (Also called operating statement or profit and loss statement.) An accounting of income and expenses for a period of time (usually 1 year) for the purpose of calculating net farm or ranch income, or net loss for the period.<p>

<b>Inflation</b> -- A continuous increase in the general price level, thus a decline in the purchasing power of money.<p>

<b>Interest </b>-- A calculated rent paid for the use of someone else's money, or an opportunity cost on the use of owned capital.<p>

<b>Interest on Operating Capital and Equipment Investment </b>-- A calculated cost, or opportunity cost, on the use of capital in the business. For some farmers and ranchers, the interest cost might be a cash outlay while for others it might be an imputed cost.<p>

<b>Intermediate Assets</b> -- Assets which are less liquid than current assets or which have a useful life of more than 1 year but less than 10 or 15 years. Examples include trucks, breeding or dairy livestock and machinery.<p>

<b>Intermediate Liabilities</b> -- Notes or mortgages held on intermediate assets.<p>

<b>Leases</b> -- A contractual (verbal or written) obligation to use some asset belonging to another individual for a specified time period and for a specified fee. Only a fine distinction exists between a rental agreement and a lease. Lease agreements often contain clauses for eventual purchase, and the leasee (the one who uses the asset) will usually pay for repairs and maintenance.<p>

<b>Leverage</b> -- Use of borrowed funds as supplemental equity capital. The leverage ratio measures the degree to which borrowed capital exceeds net worth.<p>

<b>Liability</b> -- A debt or obligation expressed in terms of money.<p>

<b>Line of Credit </b>-- An agreed-upon amount which may be borrowed in the course of normal operation. Interest is usually charged only on the amount actually used, and only over the period in which it is actually used.<p>

<b>Liquidity </b>-- The ease and speed with which assets could be turned into cash. Liquid assets are those that can be quickly converted to cash.<p>

<b>Long--Term Assets </b>-- Assets with a useful life of more than 10 years. Examples include land and buildings.<p>

<b>Long-Term Liabilities</b> -- Notes or mortgages held on long-term assets.<p>

<b>Marginal Costs</b> -- Marginal cost is a concept related to the production function and related cost curves, and represents the additional cost of one additional unit of output. Marginal cost is defined as a change in total cost divided by a related change in output.<p>

<b>Marginal Physical Product </b>-- Marginal physical pro duct is a concept related to the production function and represents the increase in output generated by the last unit of variable input applied, i.e., change in output pro duced divided by change in input used.<p>

<b>Marginal Revenue</b> -- Marginal revenue is a concept related to the production function. It is defined as the additional revenue generated by an additional unit of output, i.e., change in total revenue divided by change in output. In most agricultural commodities, an individual farmer or rancher cannot affect price; therefore, marginal revenue is the unit price of the output.<p>



<b>Net Farm or Ranch Income </b>-- Returns to labor, management, capital, land and risk, i.e., gross returns minus purchased inputs and fixed costs.<p>

<b>Net Operating Profit </b>-- Gross returns minus total operating expenses.<p>

<b>Operating Capital </b>-- Operating expenses minus fixed costs. The amount of cash required for all purchased inputs (including labor, fuel, oil and repairs) to produce a crop or livestock commodity, but excluding machinery, equipment and land investments.<p>

<b>Operating Expenses</b> -- The total of all costs attributable to the production of a crop or livestock commodity, except interest.<p>

<b>Opportunity Cost</b> -- Cost of using a resource in one enterprise when it could be used in alternative enterprises or investment opportunities. This is measured in terms of the return that would be obtained from using the resource in the alternative investment. For example, if cash used to buy inputs for production of a crop could also be invested at a 10% rate of interest, the opportunity cost of cash to the crop would be 10%.<p>

<b>Overhead Costs</b> -- Fixed costs not directly associated with production, such as insurance, employee benefits, land taxes and utilities. These costs, once agreed to, oc
cur without regard to level of production, or whether production exists at all.<p>

<b>Partial Budgeting</b> -- A management technique or planning procedure that lists only items of receipts and expenses affected by a particular change in procedure or organization.<p>

<b>Prepaid Expenses</b> -- Expenditures paid before the good or service has been used or consumed.<p>

<b>Present Value </b>-- An estimate of today's value of money that will be received or spent at some future date. For example, if $ 1 is to be received in 2 years, and the inflation rate is 10%, the net present value of the $1 is only 83. (Can also be used to figure net present value of a series of payments to be made in the future.) Present value captures the concept called time value of money.<p>

<b>Production Function</b> -- The physical relationship between the amounts of variable inputs applied to a crop or livestock commodity and the response of resulting output (typically yield or gain). The first few units of input applied usually result in increasingly larger amounts of output. At some point, adding more input units results in smaller and smaller additions to output and eventually may cause a decline in total output.<p>

<b>ProForma </b>-- An accounting term usually used in conjunction with the Income Statement or Balance Sheet which means the statement is a projection into the future or a budget.<p>

<b>Rate of Return on Investment </b>-- Net operating profit divided by the total machinery, equipment and land investment. It measures profitability of assets in percentage terms.<p>

<b>Ratios</b> -- One of several types of measurements used to indicate the position of a business. Ratios are often used to make comparisons with other businesses. Some commonly used ratios are:<br>
Current ratio = Current assets &#247; Current liabilities<br>
Equity ratio = Net worth &#247; Total assets<br>
Leverage ratio = Total liabilities &#247; Net worth<br>
Net capital ratio = Total assets &#247; Total liabillties<br>
Profit to net worth = Net income &#247; Net worth<p>

<b>Receipt </b>-- The term receipt can be used in two major ways: 1) a written record of a transaction, or 2) money received. In cash accounting terminology, a receipt is any item of cash inflow, such as proceeds from the sale of a good or service or borrowed money, whether or not that money can be classified as income.<p>

<b>Rent</b> -- A contractual (verbal or written) obligation to use some asset belonging to another individual for a specified time period and for a specified fee. Only a fine distinction exists between a rental agreement and a lease. Seldom will a rental agreement contain a clause for eventual purchase. Under most rental agreements, repair and maintenance costs are borne by the owner.<p>

<b>Repayment Capacity</b> -- Ability of a business to produce receipts above expenditures. In other words, ability of a business to repay money borrowed for that business.<p>

<b>Return to Land and Risk </b>-- Net operating profit minus the interest charge on the use of machinery, equipment and operating capital.<p>

<b>Return to Risk</b> -- Return to land and risk minus an additional charge for land investment. Because the only residual is the return to risk, this concept is usually called pure profit because payments have been made to all other factors of production.<p>

<b>Rollover Loans </b>-- Short-term loans obtained with the anticipation the loan will be renewed at its due date.<p>

<b>Solvency </b>-- A term used to describe the long-term financial position of the business. A business is called solvent if the value of assets exceed liabilities, and insolvent (or technically bankrupt) if liabilities exceed assets.<p>

<b>Time Value of Money</b> -- A concept which reflects the fact that the present value of a given amount of money is greater if received now than if received in the future. The reduction of value is caused by inflation, risk, interest that could be earned or because of preference for money now rather than in the future. The sooner a dollar is to be received, the greater is its present value.<p>

<b>Variable Costs</b> -- Expenses which vary with the level of production, such as labor, fuel, oil and repairs, feed, fertilizer and seed.<p>

<b>Variable Interest Rates</b> -- Interest rates on borrowed money that vary from time to time, depending on the interest rates on major money markets or the prime interest rate.<p>

<b>Whole Farm or Ranch Budget</b> -- A ProForma (or Projected) Income Statement built from the enterprises selected in the Whole Farm or Ranch Plan.<p>

<b>Whole Farm or Ranch Plan</b> -- A forward plan of farm or ranch enterprise organization for the coming year. This plan is an attempt to determine the most profitable combination of enterprises, within the constraints of available fixed resources, rotations, conservation, and financial and climatic limitations.<p>

<b>Working Capital </b>-- The amount of capital or current assets available for use in operating the business. Commonly figured as the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities.<p>

<h1>A Marketing Order, How It Works</h1>
<h2>Guide Z-301</h2>
<h3>Tom Clevenger, Professor<br>
Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Business</h3>

A federal crop marketing order is an organizational marketing alternative agricultural producers of specialty crops may want to consider. They are not permitted for livestock or the basic field crops. A marketing order would be a way for an agriculture crop industry to seek orderly marketing of its production.<p>
A federal marketing order sets up a mechanism for all producers of a crop in a given area to exercise control over selected aspects of the marketing of their crop and yet be exempt from antitrust prosecution. The federal law permitting marketing orders is the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.<p>
Each crop marketing order is developed by and for the particular needs of the commodity group seeking the marketing order. One or all of the following provisions may be included in a crop marketing order:<p>
<ol>
1.	specifying grades, size, quality or maturity;<p>

2.	advertising, promotion, market development and research;<p>

3.	allotting the amount each processor may handle or purchase;<p>

4.	establishing how much may be marketed during a set period;<p>

5.	establishing methods of determining surpluses and their control and disposition;<p>

6.	establishing a reserve product pool;<p>

7.	inspecting the product;<p>

8.	fixing the size, capacity, weight, dimensions or pack of the containers used in marketing;<p>

9.	prohibiting unfair competition and unfair trade practices; and<p>

10.	requiring processors to file their selling prices, and to not sell below prices filed.<p>
</ol>
Only those marketing tools included in a marketing order may be used by that commodity group. Any one tool, or a combination of the above, may be written into a marketing order.<p>
To start a marketing order, an order proposal must be submitted, with a request for hearings on the order, to the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. If sufficient grower support is shown, the secretary holds public hearings on the proposal. Opportunities for written comments follow the hearings. Then the secretary makes a decision whether or not to submit a proposed marketing order to a vote of all growers. The marketing order is started if two-thirds of the voting growers vote in favor of the marketing order or if those representing two-thirds of the production vote for the order. Marketing orders are ended when more than half of the growers with more than half the production vote against the order. An order may be amended through a procedure similar to that for starting the order.<p>
A marketing order is administered by an elected board of growers and processors and a public member who is elected by the other board members. Board members, other than the public member, are elected by those they represent on a one person-one vote basis. The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture oversees board actions to make sure the board does not act beyond its authority as given in the marketing order.<p>
Under the marketing order, it is the processors who are regulated. Assessments for operating the order are collected from processors or first handlers. However, they can pass that cost forward to buyers or deduct it in making their purchases from growers.  Imports are not regulated under a marketing order. <p>
Advantages of a marketing order include industry self-control, through use of selected marketing tools.  A marketing order provides a means for all growers and processors to join together for various marketing activities.  A disadvantage of a marketing order is that it is compulsory for all in the defined area.<p>

<body BGCOLOR="#ffffff" text="#000000" link="#0000c0" vlink="#000090"><img src="/cahe/images/pr.gif" height=100 width=129 align=right alt="NMSU College of Agriculture & Home Economics">
<h1>Some Marketing Alternatives for Pecans</h1>
<h2>Guide Z-303</h2>

<h3>Tom Clevenger, Professor<br>
Martin Blake, Associate Professor<br>
Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Business</h3>


Many pecan producers sell their pecans for cash at harvest. There are a number of alternatives to this approach which producers may want to consider. Most of these alternatives require some form of group action. The extra effort involved in organizing such group activity may result in a higher per unit price for pecans.<p>


<h3>Forward Contracting</h3>

Producers of large volumes of pecans tend to use forward contracting more than do producers with smaller production. A forward contract is a written agreement between a producer and a pecan sheller relating to the delivery and acceptance of pecans at some future date. Forward contracts specify what the producer will deliver. The shellers promise payment for the pecans, either by specifying the price or how the price will be determined.<p>
Shellers usually initiate forward contracts to assure themselves of enough pecans to supply their customers. Producers benefit from forward contracts by having an assured access to a market, the potential for increased operational efficiency and reduced price risk.<p>


<h3>Direct Marketing</h3>

Direct marketing of pecans involves bypassing shellers and other handlers and selling direct to the final consumer. Direct marketing can take several forms such as roadside stands, you-pick-it-off-the ground operations, farmers markets, mall order and other direct distribution schemes. Although direct marketing channels can be time consuming to establish and maintain, they can greatly increase grower returns. Research indicates that once these direct marketing channels are established, growers experience a great deal of repeat business.<p>


<h3>Vertical Integration</h3>

To be vertically integrated in the pecan business, a grower would also become a sheller. This could be done either as an individual or as a member of a group. The key is to have enough production to make the shelling facility operationally efficient. The advantages of vertical integration include the potential for profit as both a grower and a sheller, improved quality control and improved market access. Disadvantages include the capital required to establish the shelling facility, and the additional management required to operate the shelling facility and to market the shelled pecans.<p>


<h3>Cooperatives</h3>

Agricultural cooperatives represent a way for pecan growers to organize for the purpose of buying inputs at a lower price, processing the pecans or marketing the pecans, either shelled or inshell. Cooperatives are voluntary organizations and their regulations are binding only on members. They provide a means for growers to benefit from the advantages of large scale shelling, marketing or purchasing operations. It is essential to hire a manager capable of running such a large scale operation. <p>

The owners of an agricultural cooperative are also its patrons.  Cooperatives are governed by a board of directors elected by the membership.  The principle of cooperatives is that each member has one vote.  Cooperatives return profits to members based on their participation, and pay limited returns on the capital invested in the cooperative by members.<p>

<h3>Marketing Orders</h3>

Unlike cooperatives, marketing orders are binding on all members of an industry once the marketing order is established.  The pecan industry is considering adoption of a marketing order to advertise and promote pecans.<p>

<TITLE>Pecan Marketing Channels</title>

<body BGCOLOR="#ffffff" text="#000000" link="#0000c0" vlink="#000090"><img src="/cahe/images/pr.gif" height=100 width=129 align=right alt="NMSU College of Agriculture & Home Economics">
<h1>Pecan Marketing Channels</h1>
<h2>Guide Z-305<br>
PH8-100</h2>
<h3>William D. Gorman, Professor,<br> Department of Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Business<br>
Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</h3>

Marketing channels in the pecan marketing system are shown in figure 1. Pecans are marketed in two forms, shelled and inshell. Some firms handle both shelled and inshell pecans. These two product forms are similar to the fresh (inshell) and processed (shelled) forms that exist for many fruits and vegetables.<p>

(NOTE:  Figure 1 not available.  See PDF file or contact NMSU Agricultural Communications for a hard copy.) <p>

<h3>Farm Input Suppliers</h3>

Farm input suppliers provide the goods and services farmers use to produce pecans. At this marketing system level, farmers buy fuel, lubricants, pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, equipment for harvesting and orchard maintenance, and nursery trees. Management and cultural services are provided by private companies, government agencies or land grant universities. Most of these inputs are not unique to pecan production and are readily available in most agricultural areas. The exception is equipment designed specifically for harvesting, and for maintenance of nut orchards. Because this equipment is specialized, problems may exist in obtaining service and in disposal of used equipment.<p>
Because the orchard equipment investment is high, growers with small orchard acreage in New Mexico contract their harvesting needs out to larger growers, or to harvesters who can afford the equipment. Orchard equipment manufacturers are based mainly in California, Georgia and Texas where most of the pecans are grown, but all pecan producing states have equipment dealerships. Most New Mexico producers buy their harvest and maintenance equipment from California and Texas dealers, and from Dona Ana County producers who hold manufacturers' franchises. Some growers buy their equipment needs during the Western Pecan Growers Association Conference held every year the first weekend in March in Las Cruces. The availability of pecan harvest and orchard maintenance equipment, new and used, is adequate in New Mexico.<p>

<h3>Pecan Production</h3>

The most recent survey (1985), lists 519 orchards (20 trees or more) in New Mexico, mainly along the southern border region, with a few as far north as Quay County. Dona Ana County leads the state in annual pecan production because about 70% of all pecan orchards are planted in the county.<p>
There is still development potential in the New Mexico pecan industry. However, one barrier to entry into pecan production is the capital necessary to establish an orchard. A detailed analysis of the costs to establish a pecan orchard is contained in the New Mexico State University Cooperative Extension Service Guide Z-410, <i>Pecan Orchard Establishment Costs, Investment Analysis, and Annual Expenses and Returns, 1990.</i> Unlike cotton, which can be planted and harvested in 1 year, pecan trees reach acceptable yields about 7 years after planting, and need 10 to 12 years to reach maximum production. A large amount of capital is required to cover the expenses and investment for the low-productive period.<p>
Alternate year bearing has caused great variability in pecan production in the past. Alternate year bearing refers to a year of high pecan production, followed by a year of low production. New Mexico has nearly constant pecan production, even in the low production years, because young trees coming into full bearing boost total production.<p>
The shelled nut market is usually in small packages. Common package sizes are 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-and 12-ounces. They are commonly sold through supermarkets and grocery stores. Shelled nut meats are also packed in 30-pound boxes, and sold to make candy, ice cream and other prepared food products.<p>
A byproduct of shelling, pecan shells are sold for 1) air blasting material to strip old paint from metal, 2) filler material in drilling mud used in the oil fields, 3) roughage supplement in cattle feed, 4) particle board manufacture and 5) landscape mulch-decoration.<p>


<h3>Wholesalers</h3>

Pecan wholesalers buy shelled and unshelled pecans from farmers, local buyers, accumulators and shellers. These pecans are resold to retail, industrial, institutional and other wholesale outlets.<p>


<h3>Pecan Processors</h3>

Most shelled pecans are processed again by mixers, salters, ice cream manufacturers, confectioners and bakers. Bakers and confectioners are the largest part of this market. Bakeries use pecans mainly in fruit cakes and custard pies. Confectioners use pecans to make pralines, brittle, divinity, clusters, fudge, glace and log rolls.<p>
Synthetic substitutes for pecans and other nuts have been developed and are now available for use in prepared and processed food products. The impact on the demand for pecans has not yet been assessed.<p>
Pecans for processing compete with other tree nuts, such as almonds, filberts and walnuts. Peanuts are lower priced and do not compete directly on a price basis with tree nuts. Peanuts are used primarily in salted nut mixtures and candy, while tree nuts dominate the manufacture of bakery and ice cream products.<p>


<h3>Retailers</h3>

Industries use pecans in different food products,and the retailer markets pecans directly to the consumer. The retailer buys shelled and packaged pecans, inshell pecans and food products containing pecans, then resells these products to the consumer.<p>
Supermarkets and grocery stores are the largest retail outlet for pecans and food products containing pecans. Mail order outlets and gift packers are other important retail outlets.<p>


<h3>Accumulators, Brokers and Local Buyers</h3>

Accumulators buy pecans in small quantities until they have enough to sell to shellers or wholesalers. Accumulators are an important outlet for the grower with limited pecan acreage. Some accumulators also shell or wholesale pecans.<p>
Brokers are an important market facilitator for producers with greater acreages, as well as for accumulators. They bring the buyer and seller together, and negotiate the transaction for a sales commission, but do not take ownership of the pecans. Few accumulators and brokers operate in the Western Region.<p>
Local buyers are locally established firms in the areas where pecans are produced. Pecans are bought directly from producers in large or small quantities. Some buyers also shell pecans and sell the shelled pecans to wholesalers and retail outlets. If shelling facilities are not available, nuts are sold to commercial shellers or unshelled pecans are sold to the wholesale and retail firms.<p>

<h3>Shellers</h3>

Shellers separate the pecan shell from the nut meat, then grade and package the nuts. When pecans are hauled to the shelling facility, the load is weighed and graded while still on the truck or trailer. Although there are U.S. Department of Agriculture grades for pecans, most Western Region buyers regard them as inadequate because the grades are too generalized. Also, the bright golden color obtained in Western pecan kernels is better than the top color (golden) in the USDA classification. Buyers feel their own grading system is more efficient. Detailed information is outlined in NMSU Cooperative Extension Guide H-630, <i>Pecan Buyers and Custom Shellers in the Western Pecan Growing Region.</i><p>
After sampling and grading, most pecans are held in cold storage. After coming out of storage, the nuts are washed, sized and prepared for cracking. After nuts have been cracked or stripped of shells, the pecan nut meats are classified as fines, bits, pieces or halves (small, large, jumbo and chipped). These pecan nut meats are typically packaged in one of two ways. The first method is packaging for direct outlets that account for a minor portion of pecan sales (2- to 12-ounce packages). The second method is the 30-pound boxes sold to major food processing companies.<p>

<h3>Consumers</h3>

The per capita consumption of pecans in the United States remains relatively steady at approximately .52 pounds annually for the most recent 5-year period (table 1). This is an increase of about 13% over the previous 5-year period and 40% over the 1974-79 period. Pecans rank second in per capita consumption behind almonds, which averaged about .61 pounds per capita for the most recent 5-year period.<p>

<h3>Production, Exports and Imports</h3>

Total pecan production ranges from a low of 183.5 million pounds (in shell) in 1980 to 339.1 million pounds in 1981 (table 2). Annual production of improved varieties has remained relatively stable since 1981-82. The production of native varieties fluctuates widely from one year to the next.<p>
Imports of pecans have been highly variable the past 10 years, ranging from a low of 849,000 pounds (shelled) in 1981 to a high of 14.3 million pounds (shelled) in 1985-86 (table 3). Imports have averaged 9.8 million (shelled) pounds for the past 5 years or about 8% of total domestic production. Most of the imported pecans originate in Mexico. Exports of pecans increased substantially in 1989-90 reaching more than 9 million pounds (shelled) or about 9% of total production in 1989-90.<p>

Long-run continued success of New Mexico's commercial chile crop will, as always, depend upon the profitability of the crop in any or all of its various forms. Table 1 presents typical costs and returns of producing chile in the primary producing areas of New Mexico. These estimates provide comparisons that can be used by current and prospective chile producers and processors to assess the profitability of chile production. <p>

<b>NOTE:</b> Table 1 is unavailable in electronic format. If you would like a hard copy of Table 1, please contact the <a href="..ces/welcome.html">Cooperative Extension</a> office.<p>

Chile is widely recognized throughout New Mexico and the Southwest as a diverse commodity. Not only is there the obvious red vs. green distinction, but there are clear differences between farmers' market, roadside stand, and wholesale for further processing forms of sales as fresh, canned, chopped, and processed for salsa and enchilada sauce. Red chile is destined primarily for food and dye uses, made into ristras, and sold whole, chopped, or ground. Regardless of the end use of the chile, the crop must provide an adequate return to cover all of the producer's costs. <p>

Increased profit can be generated by obtaining a higher price or reducing costs. The cost-return relationship must be examined carefully by every producer of every commodity, whether in an agricultural or manufacturing commodity or even in a service business. Because of the economic structure of agricultural markets, cost and return relationships are particularly important. The basic building blocks of cost and return analysis are enterprise budgets, which are later organized and compiled into other budgets, including whole farm, partial, and cash flow budgets. An enterprise budget includes all costs and returns associated with producing an enterprise in some particular manner. Enterprise budgets are constructed on a per-unit basis, such as per acre, to make workable comparisons among alternative enterprises. An enterprise is any activity that results in a product used on the farm or sold in the market, and farm is made up of one or many enterprises. Each enterprise requires a certain combination of resources, such as land, labor, machinery, capital, and purchased inputs.<p>

Enterprise budgets can estimate costs and returns on enterprises currently in the farm plan, as well as new enterprises being considered. Most enterprise budgets also list physical resources needed for production, which is useful information for prospective new producers of a commodity. In addition to producers, many other professionals in agriculture find enterprise budgets valuable information sources. These include lenders, assessors and appraisers, consultants, and lawyers. The New Mexico State University Cooperative Extension Service publishes representative budgets for various regions of the state annually. These enterprise budges represent typical costs and returns for a given size and method of production, in a particular region of the state. The budgets are not averages, but represent typical situations.<p>

NMSU budgets represent current conditions for farming situations where management is above average. Adjusting these budgets for prices and yields expected in the future would increase their value as decision-making tools. Projections based upon the unique set of conditions on each farm would be of most value. Some items can be modified easily to build more personalized budgets. Quantities and prices of purchased inputs, yields and prices of crops, the cost of fuel, and labor costs may be readily adapted to individual farms. Another example of a modification to these budgets is to analyze each operation performed on each crop. If these operations are performed in a different pattern, the budgets should be changed. Yields and prices of all crops are highly variable from year to year. In analyzing historical budgets for use in forward planning, the astute manager will decide how much risk can be absorbed, and select cropping patterns accordingly. In forward planning, the manager should consider both optimistic and pessimistic price and yield combinations to account for risk, and should consider crop rotation plans.<p>

The effect of the various costs on planning decisions and business analysis is very important. These estimates present a full cost approach to enterprise analysis. Many of the costs are opportunity costs, that is, they are real costs of doing business, but may not be cash expenditures. For example, if all labor is provided by the operator, then the entire amount listed in these estimates is money that can be kept by the operator—it represents a return to operator and family labor. Similarly, all land and all capital is charged at competitive rates regardless of whether land is rented or owned or whether capital is borrowed or owned.<p>

The key to interpreting the "bottom-line" figure calculated in these estimates lies in the type of decision at hand. For next year's crop, the important point is the level of gross margins, the returns minus all cash expenses. Can enough cash be generated to meet reasonable family living needs and to cover all financial debt commitments? In the long run, all expenses must be covered (of particular importance when trying to determine whether to buy a farm). In the short run, a negative net income is not desirable, but may not necessarily be enough to cause business failure. For a short while, depreciation and other non-cash costs can provide a cushion to get over the hump.<p>

Budgets like these are updated annually. More detailed estimates and a guide to using the budgets (NMSU Extension publication 400 Z-32) may be obtained from each county Extension farm management specialist.<p>

<h3>GLOSSARY</h3>
<i>Depreciation expense:</i> Annual allowance for the deterioration of an asset whose productive life is more than one year. Depreciation is not paid in cash, but it is an expense to the business since the purchase price of a long-lived asset cannot and should not be deducted in any one year.<p>

<i>Enterprise budget:</i> A detailed full-cost listing of all returns and cost (whether paid or unpaid) associated with a particular crop or livestock enterprise.<p>

<i>Fixed costs:</i> Expenses that do not vary with the level of production, such as depreciation and personal property taxes. For example, personal property taxes are the same on a tractor regardless of whether that tractor is used on one acre or 300 acres. (Line E)<p>

<i>Gross returns:</i> Total cash receipts from a crop, i.e. total yield times price. (Line A)<p>

<i>Interest on operating capital and equipment investment:</i> A calculated cost, or opportunity cost, on the use of capital in the farm business. For some farmers, interest cost might be a cash outlay while for others it might be a imputed cost. (Lines I and J)<p>

<i>Net farm income:</i> Returns to labor management, capital, land and risk, i.e., gross returns minus purchased inputs, fuel, oil, lubricants, repairs, and fixed costs. (Line F)<p>

<i>Net operating profit:</i> Gross returns minus total operating expenses. (Line H)<p>

<i>Operating capital:</i> Operating expenses minus fixed costs, i.e. the amount of cash required for all purchased inputs (including labor, fuel, oil and repairs) to produce a crop, without regard to machinery, equipment and land investments.<p>

<i>Operating expenses:</i> The total of all costs of producing a crop, except interest.<p>

<i>Opportunity cost:</i> The cost of using a resource in one enterprise when it could be used in alternative enterprises or investment opportunities measured by the return that could be obtained from using the resource in the alternative investment. For example, if cash used in crop production could be placed in the bank at a 10% rate of interest, the opportunity cost of cash to the crop would be 10%.<p>

<i>Overhead expenses:</i> Expenses not directly associated with production, such as insurance, employee benefits, land taxes, and utilities. These costs occur without regard to level of production, or whether production exists at all.<p>

<i>Partial budgeting:</i> A planning procedure that lists only items of receipts and expenses that are affected by a particular change in procedure or organization.<p>

<i>Rate of return on investment:</i> Net operating profit divided by the total machinery, equipment, and land investment. A measure of profitability of assets in percentage terms.<p>

<i>Return over cash expenses:</i> Gross returns less all cash operating expenses. (Line C = A–B)<p>

<i>Return to land and risk:</i> Net operating profit minus the interest change on the use of machinery, equipment, and operating capital. This return figure shows the final return before a land charge is calculated. (Line L)<p>

<i>Return to risk:</i> Return to land and risk minus a charge for land investment; the amount of gross returns left over after charges are made for every factor of production.<p>

<i>Variable cost:</i> Expenses that vary with the level of level of production, such as labor, fuel, oil and repairs, fertilizer, and seed.<p>

<i>Gross margins:</i> Returns minus variable costs; the most important short-run planning figure.<p>

<i>Return to capital, labor, land, and risk:</i> Charges for the listed factors of capital, labor, and land have not yet been subtracted from gross returns. Typically, these three factors are owned.<p>

<i>Whole-farm budget:</i> Projected crop mix revenues and expenses for a production year. A projected plan and income statement.<p>

<TITLE>Economic Importance of the Pecan Industry</title>
</head>
<body BGCOLOR="#ffffff" text="#000000" link="#0000c0" vlink="#000090"><img src="/cahe/images/pr.gif" height=100 width=129 align=right alt="NMSU College of Agriculture & Home Economics">
<h1>Economic Importance of the Pecan Industry</h1>
<h2>Guide Z-501<br>
PH 1-200</h2>
<h3>Esteban Herrera, Extension Horticulturist</h3>
The U.S. is the world's largest pecan producer. Other countries producing pecans include Australia, Brazil, Israel, Mexico, Peru, and South Africa.<p>
Two types of pecans are produced in the U.S.: native or seedling, and improved varieties. Native pecans are varieties that developed under natural conditions. Seedling pecans are produced from seed (the nut) and have not been budded or grafted. Improved pecans are varieties that have been genetically altered through breeding and grafting techniques to produce more nuts, and nuts with a greater percentage of nut meat.<p>
<h3>Pecan Production by States</h3>
Depending on the variety, pecan trees require 205-233 frost-free days for the nuts to reach maturity, thus restricting pecan production to southern states. The following states are most important in commercial pecan tree growing: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas (table 1). Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Tennessee, and Virginia also grow some pecan trees.<p>
The top five states, in order of native pecan production from 1970 to 1992, were Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Alabama. The top five states, in order of improved pecan production from 1978 to 1986, were Georgia, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and Alabama. When total pecan production is included, Georgia remains the top producer, followed by Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and Louisiana.<p>
<h3>Pecan Production</h3>
From 1970 to 1992, 1981 saw the largest pecan crop, totaling almost 340 million in-shell pounds. The lowest pecan production was about 103.1 million in-shell pounds in 1976. The second lowest production was 176 million in-shell pounds in 1992. While this production variability exists for both native and improved pecans, improved pecan production ranged from 48% (1979) to 78% (1982) of total production from 1978 to 1992.<p>
<h3>Pecan Prices</h3>
The U.S. average price for improved pecans has been consistently above the U.S. average native pecan price. In part, this price differential results from quality differences, meat yields, and differences in quantities produced.<p>
From 1970 to 1992, U.S. average pecan prices ranged from a low of 29.8 cents (1971) per in-shell pound to a high of $1.10 (1992) per in-shell pound for native pecans, and from 35.4 cents (1971) to $1.52 (1992) per in-shell pound for improved pecans. During this same period, U.S. improved pecans averaged 72.4 cents per pound, while native or seedling pecans averaged 46.6 cents per poundãan average price difference of 25.8 cents per pound. Differences in prices from state to state reflect national and local difference in supply and demand, as well as differences in quality, nut meats obtained, and market outlets.<p>
The annual gross value of pecans produced from 1970 to 1992 ranged from $60.5 million in 1970 to $309 million in 1991, changing dramatically over the years.<p>
<h3>Pecan Imports/Exports</h3>
Historically, pecan imports and exports have been only a small portion of total U.S. pecan production. From 1970 to 1992, imports (shelled basis) ranged from a low of 0.2% (1981) of total U.S. production that year, to a high of 52% (1986), while exports reached an all-time high in 1990 with more than 9 million pounds (shelled) or about 9% of the total U.S. production. Imports from Mexico and exports to European countries have increased significantly since 1988.<p>

<h1>Pecan Prices and Grades</h1>
<h2>Guide Z-502</h2>

<h3>Tom Clevenger, Professor<br>
Martin Bloke. Associate Professor<br>
Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Business</h3>


Although there are U.S. Department of Agriculture grades for pecans, most buyers regard them as inadequate. Buyers feel they can use their own grading system more efficiently.<p>
Most buyers use a three-grade system which consists of Fancy or Select, Choice, and Standard or Ambers, with Fancy grades being the highest quality and Amber grades the lowest. Pecans are placed into one of these three grades using the following criteria: nut size, meat size, color of the meats and the shell-out percentage of the nut. Shell-out percentage refers to the amount of nut meat yield relative to the weight of the whole pecan. Once pecans are sampled and graded, the producer's price is calculated.<p>
Most buyers base their inshell pecan price on the prices they expect to receive for nut meats, rather than the whole inshell pecan. Price expectations for pecan nut meats are influenced by such factors as the current year production of pecans, current supply of competing nuts, demand for nuts, imports and exports of pecans and other nuts, and the quantity of pecans and other nuts carried over from the previous year. To arrive at a price for producers' inshell pecans, shellers subtract estimated shelling costs and profit margin from the price expected for nut meats. Once the buyer sets the purchase price for nut meats, the price of the inshell pecans can be determined based upon the shell-out percentage. This is done by a shell-out test.<p>
As an example, assume pecans shell out at 58% nut meats, they grade Fancy and the buyer is willing to pay $1.70 per Fancy nut meat pound. The buyer would then pay the producer 98.6 cents per pound for the inshell pecans ($1.70 x 58% = $0.986). If the lots graded out at Choice or Amber, the same pricing strategy is used, except the price paid for those nut meats would be less than for Fancy.<p>
If a particular lot is not of a uniform grade, the buyer would base his price on the percentage of each grade in the sample. For example, if a producer sold pecans consisting of 70% Fancy, 20% Choice and 10% Amber, the buyer would calculate a weighted price as follows:<p>

<pre>		  (70% at $1.70/nut meat pound) = $1.19 
		+ (20% at $1.60/nut meat pound) = $ .32
		+ (10% at $1.55/nut meat pound) = $ .15 
			Lot total = $1.66/nut meat pound
</pre>
Assuming the shell-out test was 56%, the final lot price would be 56% x $1.66 = $0.93 per pound of inshell nuts.<p>
Pecans bought for later sale as inshell pecans tend to bring higher prices than inshell pecans bought for shelling. Pecans sold for final sale in-shell are the high priced end of the market. The quantity of pecans demanded for inshell use has been fairly stable, regardless of price.<p>
Pecans entering the inshell final use market must have certain characteristics which make them pleasing to consumers. These include size, shape, and coloring of the shell, as well as a thin paper shell.<p>

<TITLE>Social Security and Medicare Taxes on Farms and Ranches</title>
</head>
<body BGCOLOR="#ffffff" text="#000000" link="#0000c0" vlink="#000090"><img src="/cahe/images/pr.gif" height=100 width=129 align=right alt="NMSU College of Agriculture & Home Economics">
<h1>Social Security and Medicare Taxes on Farms and Ranches</h1>
<h2>Guide Z-808</h2>
<h3>James D. Libbin Professor, <br>
Agricultural Economics & Agricultural Business<br>
Ginger T. Garrett, Business Analyst</h3>

Self-employment and Medicare taxes are imposed on farmers, ranchers and other self-employed persons to include them in Social Security and Medicare coverage. These benefits can be substantial, but are not intended to provide full retirement benefits. In addition to paying his or her own self-employment tax, a farmer or rancher is usually required to withhold and pay Social Security and Medicare taxes as an employer on behalf of employees.<p>
<h3>WHO MUST PAY THE SELF-EMPLOYMENT TAX?</h3>
The following groups are typically liable for self-employment tax:<p>
<ul>
<li> Farm and ranch owner-operators<p>
<li> Tenants and share farmers<p>
<li> Landlords<p>
<li> Farm or ranch partners<p>
<li> Children with net earnings of $400 or more from 4-H or FFA projects, or any other source.<p>
</ul>
Any of these individuals may owe self-employment tax if they had net earnings of $400 or more from self employment. The law considers a person who operates a business to be self employed. Each of the above groups may be considered self-employed, although material participation also must be considered for the second and third groups. Tests for material participation are discussed later.<p>
Each member (but only the general partners) of a farm or ranch partnership must report his or her share of the self-employment net earnings of the partnership, whether or not they actually participate in its operation. (A limited partner is not subject to self-employment taxes.) The self-employment earnings of a husband/wife partnership are usually attributed to one spouse who is the primary operator of the business. Joint ownership of land does not qualify a spouse for self-employment tax.<p>
Self-employment tax is due regardless of age. A child may owe self-employment tax on 4-H or FFA project earnings, although there may be no income tax due. Her grandfather, who is retired and drawing Social Security benefits, may also owe self-employment and Medicare taxes on the farm he share-rents. If an individual works part-time for a neighbor, the neighbor may need to withhold Social Security and Medicare tax.<p>
Many persons receive self-employment income, as well as wages as employees. They are still subject to the self-employment tax unless they earned wages equal to the maximum wage base.<p>
In 1992, the Social Security wage base was $55,500 and the wage base for Medicare was $130,200. The tax rates were 6.2% for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare, for a total of a 7.65% paix by the employee and employer. For self-employed individuals, that rate is doubled (to 15.3% in 1992), but half of the tax is deductible for federal income tax purposes.<p>
The following examples demonstrate the effect of wage base levels and tax rates. In each case, amounts are computed on Schedule SE and are in addition to Social Security and Medicare taxes withheld by employers. <p>
___________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
<b>Example 1.</b>  In 1992, a taxpayer earns $35,000 in wages subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes. The taxpayer also earns $20,000 in self-employment (Schedule F) net farm income. Because the $30,000 in wages falls below both wage bases, the taxpayer must complete and file Schedule SE with his tax return and pay additional self-employment taxes. First, make an adjustment to net earnings from self employment to account for deductibility of the tax:<p>
<pre>
	Net earnings from self employment: 
	$20,000 (1 - 0.765) = $20,000 x 0.9235 = $18,470

	Then, compute Social Security and Medicare taxes:

	Social Security tax:	$18,470 x (2 x 0.062) = 	  $2,290

	Medicare tax:		$18,470 x (2 x 0.0145) = 	  $536
								_________
	Total							  $2,826</pre>

This additional tax is entered on Form 1040 (line 47 in 1991) and one half of this amount, or $1,413 is entered on Form 1040 as a deduction for Adjusted Gross Income (line 25 in 1991).<br>
_____________________________________________________________________________________________<p>
_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
<b>Example 2.</b>  In 1992, the taxpayer earns $35,000 in wages, $10,000 in self-employment net farm income (Schedule F), and $10,000 in self-employment net income from a non-farm (Schedule C) business. The tax liability for this case is exactly the same as for Example 1 since self-employment income from all Schedule F and Schedule C sources is combined before the net earnings from self-employment amount is computed.<br>
_____________________________________________________________________________________________<p>
_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br>

<b>Example 3.</b> In 1992, wage income is $35,000 and self-employment income is $40,000.  In this case, combined wage and self-employment income exceeds the Social Security wage base (but not the Medicare wage bases).<p>


<pre>	Net earnings from self employment: $40,000 x 0.9235 = $36,940

	Net earnings subject to Social Security tax:

				Social Security Wage

	Taxable portion:  $55,500 (Base) - $35,000 (Wages) =	  $20,500

	Social Security tax:	$20,500 x (2 x 0.062) = 	  $2,542

 	Medicare tax:		$36,940 x (2 x 0.0145)  = 	  $1,071
								___________
	Total							  $3,613	

	Deductible portion:	$3,613 ˜ 2 = $1,807</pre>
______________________________________________________________________________________________<p>

______________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
<b>Example 4.</b> In 1992, wage income is $70,000 and self-employment income is $40,000. In this case, wages exceed the Social Security wage base, but not the Medicare base.<p>

<pre>	Net earnings from self employment:  $40,000 x 0.9235 = $36,940

	Social Security tax:					    0

	Medicare tax:		$36,940 x (2 x 0.0145) = 	  $1,071
								___________
	Total:							  $1,071

	Portion deductible for federal income tax purposes:  $1,071 ˜ 2 = $817 </pre>
______________________________________________________________________________________________<p>
______________________________________________________________________________________________<br>
<b>Example 5.</b> In 1992, wage income is $70,000 and self-employment income is $80,000. In this case, your combined wage and income base exceeded both the Social Security and Medicare wage bases, but Medicare tax is still due.<p>

<pre>	Net earnings from self-employment subject to Medicare tax:

	Taxable portion:	$130,200 (Base) - $70,000 (wages) = $56,320

	Social Security tax:					    0

	Medicare tax:		$56,320 x (2 x 0.0145)   = 	  $1,633
								___________
	Total							  $1,633

	Deductible portion:	$1,633 ˜ 2 =  $817</pre>
______________________________________________________________________________________________<p>
______________________________________________________________________________________________<br>

<b>Example 6.</b> In 1992, wage income is $140,000 and self-employment income is $80,000. Both the Social Security and Medicare wage bases have been exceeded no taxes in addition to those withheld from wages are owed.
Tax liability for self-employment income is determined by completing Schedule SE, Computation of Social Security Self-Employment Tax.<br>
_______________________________________________________________________________________________<p>

<h3>SELF-EMPLOYMENT EARNINGS</h3>
In general, net farm or ranch profit from Schedule F becomes self-employment income from farming. (IRS recognizes no difference between a farm and ranch). Net farm profit represents gross income from the sale of market grains and livestock and other ordinary income, minus business deductions allowable for tax purposes. In addition, if you are engaged in or are a partner in another business or have other self-employment income, this income must be included to determine total net earnings from self-employment.<p>
Several unusual items that should or should not be included in determining self-employment income are discussed in IRS Publication 225, "Farmer's Tax Guide," IRS Publication 533, "Self-Employment Tax," and Social Security Administration Publication No. 05-10025, "Farmers...How to Report Your Income for Social Security." Gains or losses from the disposal of capital and business assets are not to be included. Capital gains or losses from the sale of dairy cows, tractors, land, timber or any other business assets should not be reported on Schedule F and do not affect net earnings from self-employment. However, depreciation taken on these items is a business expense, and is deducted on Schedule F.<p>
Earnings from land cash-rented to others are reported on Schedule E and thus are not considered to be self-employment earnings subject to self-employment or Medicare taxes. However, IRS now requires earnings from CRP contracts to be reported on Schedule F and thus become self-employment earnings.<p>

<h3>FARM OR RANCH OPTIONAL METHOD</h3>

The optional method of determining net earnings from self-employment provides a means to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes in low-income (even loss) years to gain coverage as a base for computing benefits (table 1). It is used only to determine a net earnings figure for self-employment and Medicare taxes and does not affect income tax liability. This optional method of reporting may be important to a young farmer or rancher who is trying to establish a base for Social Security or Medicare coverage to protect his family against possible death or disability. Likewise, as farmers or ranchers near retirement age, they may wish to use this method to avoid having any zero income years to be used in calculating their Social Security and Medicare benefits.<p>
This method of determining net earnings from self-employment is optional. There is also a similar option for nonfarm self-employment. Both options may be used as often as it is advantageous to do so.  <p>
If gross farm income is $2,400 or less, the optional method must still result in self-employment earnings of at least $400 or you cannot file. For example, if you have net earnings of $200 and gross income of $500 from self-employment, you cannot file because neither net earnings nor two-thirds of gross income comes to $400.<p>
If gross income from farming is greater than $2,400 and net earnings are less than $1,733 ($1,733 x 0.925 = $1,600.43), you may report $1,600 as net earnings for self-employment purposes.<p>
The selection of the standard or optional method must be made when completing Schedule SE of your annual tax return.<p>

<h3>LANDLORD PARTICIPATION</h3>
Rents from real estate are not usually considered self-employment income. However, owners of agricultural land may qualify as self-employed if they are actively involved, or "materially participating," in farm or ranch management or production. An owner wanting to materially participate must become actively involved in production, or management of production, on the farm or ranch. It is not possible to do this through an agent such as a farm or ranch manager.<p>
A landlord is materially participating if requirements are met in one of the following:<p>
<li> Does any three of a) pays one-half or more of crop costs, b) furnishes one-half or more of tools, equipment and livestock c) periodically advises and consults with the tenant and d) periodically inspects production activities.<p>
<li> Has frequent involvement in management decisions of the business.<p>
<li> Over a period of 5 weeks or more, works 100 hours or more in production activities.<p>
<li> Performs a combination of activities that demonstrate active involvement.<p>

Recent legislation has included more people in the payment of Social Security and Medicare taxes. As a result, farm landlords may find it difficult to avoid material participation and payment of self-employment taxes unless they cash-rent their farms.<p>
Social Security guidelines are spelled out more completely and explained with several examples in Publication No. 05-10066, "Farm Rental Income...Does it Count for Social Security Payments?" available at your local Social Security office.<p>

<h3>EARNINGS TEST</h3>
The material participation test is important for retired landowners because working while receiving Social Security benefits may cause part or all possible benefits to be lost. In 1992, persons at least 65 years old but no more than 69 may earn up to $10,200 without having their Social Security benefits reduced. If wages or self-employed earnings for the year exceed $10,200, $1 in benefits is lost for each $3 earned over the ceiling. For example, a person age 67 who earns $11,700 in 1992 will have Social Security benefits reduced by $500. <p>
Persons under 65 receiving benefits are subject to a lower wage ceiling, ($7,440) and a 2-for-1 benefits deduction. For example, if a 64-year old person earns $8,440, Social Security benefits will be reduced by $500. However, these limits do not apply after age 70.<p>
A retired landowner who continues to participate materially in the operation of a farm must continue to pay self-employment tax. Part or all Social Security benefits may be lost because share-rental income is treated as earned income. For this reason, many landowners have gone to cash-rent leases to avoid material participation. CRP contracts for retired landowners are not considered to be material participation and thus will not affect Social Security benefits.<p>
Because the $10,200 earnings test is an annual limit, give careful thought to the date when you retire and are entitled to receive Social Security benefitsãwhat year and when during the year.  "Entitlement" is a Social Security term that defines the month you are entitled to receive benefits.  In the calendar year you become entitled to benefits, you may relate benefits to earnings on a monthly basis.  Thus, during the first year, you would lose Social Security benefits only in months that earned income exceeds $850.  If you retire in January, you would use the monthly test for the entire 12 months, but if you become entitled in November, you only use the monthly earnings test for two months.  Whether this is important to you depends on the amount and sources of income expected after retirement.<p>
A recent change allows farmers and other self-employed persons to exclude the sale of stored crops from earned income, regardless of when it is sold. More precisely, this is self-employment income received in a taxable year after the year of entitlement, from services performed during the year before the month of entitlement. Because many crops are harvested in the fall, this policy suggests that farmers should probably delay retirement until their last crops are harvested and stored. If December becomes the month of entitlement, sale of grain from this last crop in the next, or later years, can be excluded from earned income in those years, and not reduce benefits. However, whenever the crop is sold, it will be subject to both income and self-employment tax. The intent is that self-employed persons not be penalized in Social Security benefits for receipt of self-employment business income earned before entitlement, but not received until after entitlement.<p>
There is an apparent conflict between obtaining the maximum benefit from both of these provisionsãthe monthly earnings test and exclusion of self-employment income. If you expect large amounts of earned income in the year of entitlement that can be concentrated into a few months, you may wish to delay entitlement until early in the calendar year. If excluding income from carryover crops is your major concern, becoming entitled after harvest in November or December may be your best plan. Discussion of your situation with your local Social Security representative should help you arrive at the best decision for you.<p>
<h3>EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE TAXES</h3>
Farm and ranch employers must withhold Social Security and Medicare taxes from total cash wages paid, match the amount withheld, and forward taxes due to IRS (see Farmer's Tax Guide). Farm and ranch employers must also withhold federal income taxes as well as state income taxes and remit them to the proper authorities. Any federal income taxes withheld are forwarded along with Social Security and Medicare withholdings and matching amounts to the IRS, either by deposit with a bank or remittance with the proper tax form. However, state income taxes withheld should be mailed to the Taxation and Revenue Department in Santa Fe. This may be done monthly, quarterly or semi-annually, depending on the dollar amount of the liability. You must follow these rules if you have one or more agricultural employees, including your parents and children over age 18 who meet either of these two tests:<p>
1. Employee is paid $150 or more in cash wages in the year.<p>
2. Employee performed agricultural labor on the farm or ranch for 20 or more days during the year for cash wages computed on a time basis.<p>

If you meet either of these criteria, you must withhold, match and deposit the tax as noted above.  Also, you must file Form 943 at the close of the year. If the total Social Security tax and withheld Federal income tax is less than $500 for the year, you may pay when you file Form 943; otherwise you must make deposits during the year.<p>

Some types of family employment are not covered by Social Security and Medicare tax provisions. Employers may not withhold Social Security and Medicare taxes even if the employee would like to have his or her own Social Security record. Noncovered family employment is any work performed by:<p>
<ul>
<li> A child under 18 years of age employed by his or her father or mother.<p>

<li> A child under 21 years of age employed by either parent for:br>
<ul>
a. work not in a trade or business<br>
b. domestic service in the parent's private home.<p>
</ul>
<li>Either spouse who is employed by the other spouse while performing:<br>
<ul>
a. work not in a trade or business<br>
b. domestic service in a private home.<p>
</ul>
<li> A parent employed by a son or daughter performing:<br>
<ul>
a. work not in the son or daughter's trade or business.<br>
b. a domestic service in the private home of the son or daughter<p>
</ul>
</ul>

These exemptions are required, not optional. A 20-year old employed by a parent cannot elect coverage, and no Social Security or Medicare tax is to be paid on these wages.<p>
However, the family exclusion does not apply to work performed for:<p>
<ul>
<li> a corporation<br>
<li> a partnership, unless the relationship exists between employee and each of the partners.<p>
</ul>
For example, if two brothers have a partnership and the 17-year old son of one of the brothers works for them, he must be treated as any other employee and full employer and employee Social Security and Medicare taxes must be paid.<p>
Some of these exemptions and rules seem to be in conflict and some of the definitions that seem to be obvious at first reading can later become unintelligible. For example, work not in a trade or business can be difficult to define. Usually, work not in a trade or business involves personal chores, yardwork, babysitting, and any work connected with a hobby (including a not-for-profit, or hobby farm).<p>
Two other issues always cause a great deal of concern. First, noncash wages paid to employees are subject to income tax and withholding rules but are not subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes. Paying employees with goods and services such as a prespecified number of livestock or bushels of grain avoids Social Security and Medicare coverage (and may leave the employee exposed from lack of this insurance coverage) but does not avoid income tax. Second, wages paid to a spouse may not be used to gain Social Security coverage for the spouse in his or her own name; however, many farmers pay their spouses to reduce Schedule F net profit. Since the spouse must pay income tax on those earnings, there is most likely no net income tax gain (the only income tax gain possible would come about through filing separately), but there might be a self-employment tax reduction for the employing spouse.<p>

<a name="EGIdentifying.html"><h3>Identifying College of Agriculture and Home Economics Faculty</h3></a>

Faculty in the College often are employed by more than one entity: New Mexico State University Cooperative Extension Service (CES), New Mexico State University Agricultural Experiment Station (AES), and the university's academic programs (AP). Individuals in the directory are identified according to their agency appointments.
Some faculty members have 100 percent CES, AES, or AP appointments and are easily identified. Some faculty members are employed by all three entities and could be properly identified all three ways. <p>

For example: In a story about research, James D. Libbin could be identified this way: James D. Libbin, NMSU Agricultural Experiment Station agricultural economist. 
In a story giving general public information, he could be identified as James D. Libbin, NMSU Cooperative Extension Service agricultural economist.<p>

In a story about classes at NMSU, he would be referred to as James D. Libbin, NMSU professor of agricultural economics.<p>


<a name="EGDescription.html"><h3>Description of the College and Its Departments</h3></a>


<a name="EGCAHE.html"><h4>College of Agriculture and Home Economics</h4></a>

The College of Agriculture and Home Economics is located in Las Cruces on the west end of New Mexico State University, the state's original land-grant university. The College is separate from New Mexico's Department of Agriculture, which is also located on the NMSU campus.<p>

The distinctive focus of the College is to promote the beneficial uses of plants, animals, soil, and water for food, fiber, fuel, and recreation and to improve the quality of human, family, and consumer resources and services.<p>

The College's goals include:<p>
<ul>
<li>Educating students for careers in agricultural, natural, life, and social sciences.<p>

<li>Finding practical answers to problems facing New Mexico's people, environment, and agricultural industry.<p>

<li>Providing research-based knowledge about problems to the New Mexicans who need the information the most.<p>
</ul>

The College comprises three major units:  Academic Programs, the Agricultural Experiment Station, and the Cooperative Extension Service.<p>

<a name="EGacademic.html"><h4>Academic Programs</h4></a>

The Academic Programs unit leads the College's teaching functions. It educates professionals for work in all facets of the food and fiber industries and natural resource management. The College offers more than 35 undergraduate majors.<p>

<a name="EGagriculturalExperiment.html"><h4>Agricultural Experiment Station</h4></a>

The College's Agricultural Experiment Station (AES) comprises more than 100 scientists. They conduct research that supports the state's multi-billion-dollar agricultural industry, manages and conserves the state's fragile natural resources, and improves the quality of life for New Mexicans. Research on agricultural commodities includes programs in livestock and range management, agronomic crops, horticultural crops, and forestry.<p>

AES operates agricultural science centers at Alcalde, Artesia, Clovis, Farmington, Los Lunas, and Tucumcari.

<a name="EGCES.html"><h4>Cooperative Extension Service</h4></a>

The Cooperative Extension Service, a cooperative effort between the College and county governments with state and federal support, provides the formal educational outreach of the College. Its mission is to help New Mexicans use research-based knowledge to improve the quality of their lives. Extension faculty are located in all 33 counties in the state, showing that New Mexico's borders are the only boundaries of the New Mexico State University campus. Extension programs address New Mexicans' needs in the areas of animal resources, rural economic development, plant sciences, home economics, and 4-H and youth development.<p>

<H1>BIO</H1>

My name is 'CC' Chamberlin, and I am a multimedia specialist at
New Mexico State University's <a href="http://elroy.nmsu.edu/cahe/agcom">Agricultural
Communications</a> department.  (I already know the <A HREF="joke.html">joke</A> you
want to make.)<P>

Basically, I create computer graphics for the award-winning video unit and
write interactive multimedia programs for museums, schools, etc.  It's a
fun job, if I do say so myself.  However, since it involves using computers
day and night, I rarely have the stomach to sit down and do recreational
computing.  <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com">(Yeah, right!)</a><P>

<H2>A Bit of History</H2>
I was born and raised in Albuquerque, and I have lived here in New Mexico most
of my life, with the exception of a stint in Washington, D.C.<P>

I went to NMSU and double-majored in English and Mathematics,
and discovered that I enjoyed teaching mathematics.  After graduating, I
enrolled in the Education college, but found that there wasn't enough
mathematics in the math educator's program.  So when the Math Department
offered me an assisstantship, I snapped it right up, and began work on a
masters in mathematics with an emphasis on education.  By the time I was
done, I had decided to go pure math, and graduated in 1994.<P>

Around the same time that I was offered the assistantship, I was offered a
job at NMSU Agricultural Communications creating multimedia applications.
I couldn't decide which job to take, so I took both.  (And so began the era
known as 'The Busy Years.')<P>

Now, my goal is to create high-quality multimedia applications for teaching
mathematics and statistics to K-12 students.  And through the job at NMSU
Ag Comm, it looks like I might be able to do it.<P>

<H2>Likes, Dislikes, Turn-Ons, Turn-Offs...</H2>

I have been dinking around with computers as long as I can remember.  My
first computer was a Model I Level 2 TRS-80 (from Radio Shack) with 16K of
RAM.  (That's right...Kilobytes, not Megabytes.)  Then I got an Apple //e,
and then an Amiga 1000.  In high school, I futzed with a PDP-11, and now,
at my job, I am working with top-of-the-line Power Macintoshes and a
Pentium-class thing-thing.  There is talk of an SGI going in within a year
and a half.<P>

So, computers are pretty much second nature to me.  I am currently working on
cross-platform Mac/PC multimedia projects at Ag Comm, using
<a href="http://www.macromedia.com">Macromedia</a> Director.  I would like to
think that I am a pretty decent Lingo programmer ("Lingo" is the scripting
language for Director), and can do a lot of cool stuff with it.  If you're
interested, check out my <a href="lingo/">Lingo Page</a>.<P>

I have written several computer games for the various machines, many of
which are entertaining only to a close group of friends.  Now, I do it as
part of my job, as well as the less entertaining database/spreadsheet
management stuff.<P>

I'm also a fairly accomplished cartoonist, so I have some reasonable artistic
abilities.  I know how to use some of the industry standards like Adobe
Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe (formerly CoSA) After Effects, and Adobe
Premiere.  I've created 3-D models and animations using Macromedia Macromodel,
Macromedia 3D, Specular Infini-D, and Pixar Typestry, along with a little
twiddling with Pixar MacRenderman.<P>

I've also done a fair bit of creative writing, both in the horror genre, and in
general fiction.  (English majors do that.)  My boss comes to me for
proofreading/editing, and I've been published in 'El Ojito,' the NMSU undergrad
literary magazine.<P>

I have also been known to scare the pants off of some players while running
FRPG's like Chaosium's godlike game, <CITE>Call of Cthulhu</CITE>.<P>

Horror movies and literature are a CC staple.  (Too much Edgar A. Poe as a child,
I guess.)  I go to just about every horror movie that comes to the theatres, as a
matter of principle, even if it looks like it will suck.  After all, if horror
movies lose theatre-going support, they will just be direct-to-video, and then
they will be <I>really</I> bad.<P>

I also like to read about feudal Japan for some reason.  You know, samurais,
geishas, stuff like that.  I've even written a novella and some gaming materials
set in a fictional version of feudal Japan, which I will post on the web at a later
date.<P>

My musical tastes run the gamut from Vivaldi's <CITE>The Four Seasons</CITE>
to Sepultura's <CITE>Roots</CITE>, from Kate Bush's <CITE>Hounds of Love</CITE>
to Testament's <CITE>The Legacy</CITE>, from Ottmar Liebert's <CITE>Nouveau
Flamenco</CITE> to The Damned's <CITE>Phantasmagoria</CITE>.  I hate country
music.  I hate gospel music, too, unless it is creepy, atmospheric stuff like
Orff's <CITE>Carmina Burana</CITE>.<P>

  While I do a lot of 3D graphics for the video studio I work for, they
  tend to be a little on the not-so-exciting side, simply because they
  are required to be simple and to-the-point.  However, when I get a
  chance, I dabble with some projects of my own.<p>
  
  Below are images that I have created, along with the software and
  hardware used.  Enjoy!<p>

  (This page is best viewed in 24-bit, or millions, of colors, but take a
  look anyway if you're in 8 or 16 bit.  All the images have been sampled
  down to 8-bit anyway, so download time wouldn't be huge.)<p>

  <b>PEG</b><br>
  <img src="images/pegwave.gif"><img src="images/peg.gif"><br>
  'Peg' is a character I have created as a personal project.  She was
  modelled completely in <a href="http://www.specular.com">Specular</a>
  Infini-D 3.0 (no imported DXF or SWIVEL).  The texture maps were all
  drawn by hand in <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a> Photoshop.
  The image was rendered in a minute or so on a PowerMac 9500.<p>

  <hr>
  <img src="images/bedroom.gif" align="left">
  <b>Alone in a Serial Killer's Bedroom with only a Flashlight</b><hr>
  'Alone' is a still from another personal project.  Peg should hope that
  I don't decide to merge the two.  It doesn't come out so well when put
  into indexed colors, but details to notice are the cross above the bed,
  the blanket falling over the bedframe, and (of course) the bloodstains.<p>
  This room was also modelled completely in
  <a href="http://www.specular.com">Specular</a> Infini-D, and painted
  with <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a> Photoshop.  This image was
  rendered in a little over a minute on a PowerMac 9500.<p>
  
  Due to popular demand, there is a <a href="images/bigroom.jpg">large version</a>
  of this image, at a slightly different angle, available, as well as a
  <a href="images/room.qt">Quicktime Flythrough</a> (552K).<p>

  <hr>
  <img src="images/ball.gif" align="right">
  <b>The TBITC Interface Ball</b><hr>
  The TBITC Interface Ball was an exercise in remembering the simple things.
  It was created completely in <a href="http://www.specular.com">Specular</a>
  Infini-D, and was designed to be the navigational focus for an interactive
  (Shockwave) web page as well as a cohesive graphic for a video.  After
  several more complex designs, this simple design ended up being the best.
  The user can roll the ball left and right, and as he or she does so, the
  hue of the glass center turns around the RGB color wheel.  It looks pretty
  cool, and loses something as a still.  You'll have to take my word for it
  now, but when the web page is official, I'll put a link to it so you can
  see for yourself.<p>

  <b>Corn Goes Shopping</b><hr>
  I drew this little guy (and several other poses) in about twenty minutes

It is sometimes helpful to re-use code from projects you have done.  Below are
some possibly useful bits of code that I have written for 
<a href="http://www.macromedia.com">Macromedia</a> Director
that may save you a little work.  Unless noted, they are just text files; you
can cut and paste them into your own director movies.<P>

<B>Note:</b>  If you find an easier or more elegant way to implement any of
these code bits, I would be interested in seeing it!  Drop me a line at
<a href="mailto:cc@acca.nmsu.edu">cc@acca.nmsu.edu</a> and tell me about it.<p>

<hr>
<DL>
  <DT><b><a href="clock.dir.hqx">CLOCK.DIR</a></b> (17K) (New!)
  <DD>This is an example of how you can make an analog clock without using a
      lot of rotated cast members.<br>  See the <a href="examples.html#clock">
      Shockwave Version</a> on the <a href="examples.html">Examples Page</a>.
  <DT><b><a href="multilingual.html">Multilingual QuickTime Movies</a></b> (New!)
  <DD>This is a description (with code) of one way to implement several audio
      tracks with a single video QuickTime movie, complete with lingo-based
      controllers.
  <DT><b><a href="balloons.dir.hqx">BALLOONS.DIR</a></b> (50K) (New!)
  <DD>This is a sample director movie containing code that draws a speech balloon
      anywhere on the screen around any text or bitmap castmember you pass to
      the function.  The speech balloon comes complete with an attributor and
      all code.  All you have to do is set aside four sprite channels, make them
      puppets, and call makeBalloon() and removeBalloon().<br>
      See the <a href="examples.html#balloons">
      Shockwave Version</a> on the <a href="examples.html">Examples Page</a>.
  <DT><b><a href="replace.txt">replace</a></b>
  <DD>The replace function accepts three strings.  It replaces every occurrence
      of the second string in the first string with the third string. For
      example, replace("1 fish 2 fish red fish bleu fish","bleu","blue")
      would yield "1 fish 2 fish red fish blue fish".
  <DT><b><a href="button.txt">button</a></b>
  <DD>This is a simple, portable mouseDown handler that you can put into your
      button's script so that it will make a clicking noise and have a graphic
      'down' state, which won't interfere with directing the button's actions.
      You put this is the mouseDown script for the castmember, and you put what
      the button does, like going to a specific frame, in the mouseUp script in
      the sprite.  Doesn't include the mouse click noises, but you can use the
      ones off of the Director 4.0 CD-ROM.  (Or make your own.)
  <DT><b><a href="drive.txt">driveOrVolume</a></b>
  <DD>This is a very short handler to return the name of the drive or volume
      of the movie you are running.  It works on both PC's and Macs.  It does
      not return the colon after a volume or the :\ after a PC drive letter,
      although it could be easily modified to do so.

<hr>
('RuneQuest' is the Avalon Hill Game Company's trademark for its fantasy
role-playing game, or at least that's what it says on the box.  It was originally
created by <a href="http://www.sirius.com/~chaosium/chaosium.html">Chaosium, Inc.</a>,
the company that puts out other fine products such as the award-winning and
popular <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> system.)<p>

Sometime in September 1995, I began running a RuneQuest game along with a friend
of mine named Dean.  The idea was to co-referee a game, since neither of us had
the time to run a full game ourselves that would meet with any semblance of
regularity.  What you will find in these pages is some stuff created for the
campaign.  Hopefully, some of this stuff might be usable by others, so we're
putting what we can on the web.<p>

(The game is now defunct, as Dean and the other players have gone their separate
ways.  However, when I develop more RQ stuff, it will appear here.)<p>

The campaign is set in Northern Fronela, which (in our conception of Glorantha
anyway) is populated by post-nomadic barbarian clans.  All players began as
barbarians, and after some initial adventuring, will end up in a desperate
fight against the broo and other minions of chaos.<p>

Here's what we have to offer currently:

<ul>
  <li><a href="people.html">Northern Fronelan Barbarians (overview)</a>
  <li>Cults
  <ul>
    <li><a href="overview.html">Overview of the Northern Fronelan Cults</a>
    <li><a href="thorgrim.html">The Cult of Bow and Spear (Thorgrim)</a>
  </ul>
  <li><a href="bear.html"><b>The Test of the Bear</b></a>, the first adventure in
    our campaign.  (Complete except for stats of clan members.)
  <li><a href="broo.html"><b>Attack of the Broo</b></a>, the second adventure in
    our campaign.  (Under construction.)
  <li><a href="house.html">House rules</a>
  <li><a href="spells.html">New spells</a>
</ul>

For those interested, I have a <a href="../cool_links.html#runequest">small list
of other RuneQuest-related links</a>.<p>

<TITLE>Review of Sloppy's Useless Page</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"
      text="#000000" link="#0000f0" vlink="#444444">
<H1><A HREF="Welcome.html">CC</A>'s Review of
http://rt66.com/sloppy/reviews.html</H1>

  What I humbly present here is a review of the series of reviews located at
  <A HREF="http://rt66.com/sloppy/reviews.html">
  http://rt66.com/sloppy/reviews.html</A>, which were penned (coded?) by my
  pal Sloppy in a shameless plagiaristic fit.<P>
  The bulk of this page was written within days of the aforementioned page being
  put on the web.  However, since more authors are bound to come along and review
  Sloppy's page of reviews, I will add reviews of <I>their</I> reviews as
  warranted, including the respective dates of addition.<P>

<hr>
<H2>The Page Itself</H2>

  The page itself, as the author mentions, is from an idea put forth by
  good old Doug H.  Still, the idea to apply it to a WWW page has its own
  original merit, and thus, I shall not pan the page immediately.  However,
  I must protest the claim that the page is a 'collaboration.'  As one
  reviewer of the page points out, there is only credit given to one
  collaborator.  Luckily, Sloppy has myself to bail him out of that
  bold-faced lie, since he will now be able to credit myself as another
  collaborator.<P>

  It is also my opinion that the horizontal rule in the middle of the
  document is distracting and unnecessary.<P>

<hr>
<H2>The Reviews</H2>

  First, I shall review the reviews of my fellow reviewers singly, and
  then append my own comments about the reviews in general.

<hr>
<H3>Sloppy's Review</H3>
  Sloppy's review of the reviews made two essential criticisms:<P>

  <UL>
  <LI>First, Sloppy points out that the page is referred to as a
      'collaboration' of critiques, but that as far as he could tell,
      there was only one.  He must not be counting himself, because there
      are, in fact, two reviewers: Sloppy and myself.<P>
      (You might point out that at the time Sloppy wrote his review, there
      was, indeed, only one reviewer, and thus, his review was true.  This
      certainly could be the case, but even so, Sloppy's review would then
      suffer from a lack of foresight - as soon as another collaborator
      collaborates, his review would become useless!  He should have seen
      that coming.)<P>
  <LI>Second, Sloppy mentions (somewhat offhandedly) that one of the
      reviewers made a reference to how to MAKE MONEY FAST.  But, reading
      over the reviews, I notice that he has overlooked one.  In fact,
      TWO of the reviewers have made such a reference.  In addition,
      both of these reviewers failed to elaborate on how to actually
      make money fast, and to explain its relevance to these reviews.<P>
  </UL>

<hr>
<H3>Richie's Review (added 5-16-95)</H3>

  Richie is, of course, an unscrupulous cad.  <i>(Just kidding, Rich!)</i>
  As evidence:
  <UL>
  <LI>Richie writes: <I>"My first comment is that none of these so-called
  "reviews" is a true review . They suffer from the classic misnomer that a
  meta-review is a review. This is far from the case. What's a book about other
  books?  It's a meta-book....Let's have some truth in advertising! We aren't
  reading reviews,  guys! Let's get our nomenclature straight! "</I> 
  He would have us believe that a book, depending on its subject, may or may not,
  in fact, be a book!  As if what is printed on a book's pages determines its
  physical form!  A meta-book is a book. A book is a book is a book.

  <LI>Richie then writes: <I>"My second comment is that this is the most negative
  bunch of reviews I have ever seen! Reviews where every comment is negative do
  not appeal to me."</I> ...and then fails to produce any positive comments about
  the set of reviews himself!  Talk about complaining without offering solutions!
  (Jeez!)
  
  <LI>Finally, Richie writes: <I>"And then CC really lets the blood fly! He
  chimes: "In short, [the reviews] are a waste of memory and bandwidth, and should
  be taken off the web"! Sounds to me like CC is advocating censorship! How did
  you get to be king? Well, Mr. Censorship, go censor yourself! "</I>
  Granted, at first glance, it could <I>seem</I> like I was advocating censorship.
  However, if this reviewer had simply bothered to look at more than just the
  surface meaning, he would have seen that the statement was meant to be ironic!
  After all, if I really believed in the censorship I was "advocating," then I
  would never have posted that message at all!  (In addition, Richie knows me
  personally, and should know that I don't advocate censorship, which makes his
  public attack all the more shameful.)  But since I appear to have ruffled feathers,
  I have included a more politically correct conclusion at the end of this set
  of reviews.
  </UL>

<hr>
<H3>Sarang's Review (added 5-16-95)</H3>
  I have little to say about Sarang's review, although I will say that the
  reviewer after him didn't know what the hell (s)he was talking about, (read
  Sarang's review to see what I mean) and that I found that the
  <A HREF="http://www.rt66.com/proveit/sloppy.html">link he
  claims to be self-referential</A> didn't seem so self-referential to the people
  on <I>alt.sex.thirty-two-piece-oompah-bands</I> that I gave the URL to.  (Their
  observation, not mine.  It looked perfectly self-referential to me when *I*
  clicked on it...)

<hr>
<h3>Scott's Review (added 9-2-95)</h3>
  Scott's Review was a pleasure to read, as he addressed some of the more
  esoteric aspects of these reviews.  In fact, if more reviewers were to bring
  such insight and depth to these reviews, I might be forced to modify my own
  conclusions.  He manages to say something positive about almost everyone's
  review, and his criticisms are well-founded and constructive, with only a few
  exceptions.  He uses the reviews to launch off into interesting threads, and
  this, I think, may be the strength of these reviews; that something so simple
  and insular can generate questions of a much wider scope.  Good job, Scott.

<hr>
<h3>Robert's Review (added 9-2-95)</h3>
  Robert takes the opposite tack than what I applauded Scott for pointing out.
  While I think that one of the strengths of these reviews is that they are a
  springboard into new ideas, he criticizes reviewers for not staying on task.
  He says: <cite>Previous reviewers, who I do not cite, and, doubtless,
  subsequent reviewers too, have chosen to broaden the scope of their reviews
  beyond 'Reviews of This Page' itself, and sadly, into irrelevancy.</cite>.
  I disagree; it is only when we move BEYOND the exercise of reviewing that
  any relevance these pages have to the world becomes clear.  A review is a
  review, but a review that links the subject matter in a meaningful way to
  our lives is something more.<p>
  However, I must agree with Robert's applause for the brevity of Sloppy's
  <A HREF="http://rt66.com/sloppy/reviews.html">Reviews of this Page</a>.
  The reviews have a distinct potential to grow without bound (as this page
  seems to be doing), and beginning with a cluttered page would only add
  to the volumes of data to sort through before getting to something
  meaningful.  (It is ironic that I applaud him for praising a short work
  when mine is quite long.  Perhaps it is <strong>because</strong> mine is
  getting so long that I see the virtues of a short page...)

<hr>
<h3>Rich's Review (added 9-2-95)</h3>
  My review of Rich's Review will be short and sweet.  I do not recommend his
  review because you are unlikely to be able to read it; I have tried several
  times without success to access his review, but I always get a 404 not found
  error.  If I manage to read it at some future date, I will revise this review.

<hr>
<h3>Don's Review (added 9-2-95)</h3>
  What can one say about Don's Review?  It is so self-referential that it fails
  to say anything meaningful (that I can perceive, anyway).  It certainly does
  not provide the reader with any insights into whether or not they should
  bother reading these reviews.  In fact, it seems more like someone playing with
  self-reference than someone wanting to participate in the reviewing process.
  I can't recommend reading Don's review.

<H3>Some Overall Observations</H3>
  <UL>
  <LI>One of the reviewers criticizes another reviewer for not
      having the foresight to see that the number of reviewers will grow,
      but then turns around and says that there are only TWO reviewers!
      Doesn't he know that as soon as another reviewer reviews this
      collection that he will also have an inaccurate review?<P>

  <LI>Not only is that reviewer guilty of doing exactly what he was
      criticizing his fellow reviewer for, he has also failed to note that
      it isn't just ONE other reviewer that has made that same error, but
      instead, EVERY SINGLE ONE of the reviewers have made that mistake.
      I even admit that I, too, have fallen prey to it.<P>

  <LI>(Added 5-16-95) The reviewers after myself showed their malicious streaks
    by deliberately making statements in my initial review false.  (See above.)
  </UL>
  
<hr>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<strong>Notice</strong><br>
  <i>Apparently, some reviewers took my original concluding paragraphs as a
  mean-spirited proclamation for censorship advocacy.  Perhaps the irony was
  too subtle for them, because it was meant to be toungue-in-cheek instead of
  blatant negativism.  If the reviews had said something like, "While his
  statement was meant to be ironic, it came off being too negative," then I
  might believe that they understood the nature of the statement.  However,
  since they did not, I could only conclude that the irony was missed, and
  so, a more 'P.C.' alternative is being provided below for those with sensitive
  natures.  For those interested, the <a href="#original_ending">original
  concluding paragraphs</a> are provided below.</I><br>

<h3>Revised 'P.C.' Conclusion</h3>
  (Added 9/2/95)<br>
  While some people may see these reviews as a waste of time, and certainly
  several people have spent much time on them, everyone should have a right
  to post whatever they want on the web until such time as Senator Exon says
  otherwise.  (If you don't get this reference, check out my page that will
  <a href="../simse/pornography.html">give you the background</a>.)<p>
  
  At the risk of being accused of the disempowerment of others, I must say that
  I cannot recommend that you spend an afternoon reading these reviews; there
  are more productive ways to spend your time.  For instance, in the time it
  takes you to read a review (this one, for instance), you could have written
  a letter to your senator, started reading a good book, handed a homeless person
  a sandwich, or signed a petition.  This is not to say that these people should
  be oppressed, or that their voices in this changing world should not be heard.
  I am merely disappointed that the great communications resource we have at our
  fingertips is being used for THIS instead of educating tomorrow's leaders,
  understanding and reaching out to other people and cultures, and just plain
  bringing hope and peace throughout the world!  It is an opportunity missed,
  and it saddens my heart.<p>

  <i>(Okay, is that better?  Sheesh!)</i>

<a name="original_ending">
<hr>
<h4>Original Concluding Paragraphs</h4>

  <strong>Warning:</strong>  The following statements contain <i>irony</i>.
  If you don't understand irony, these paragraphs will appear to mean something
  other than what they were intended to mean, and you will probably be offended.
  You have been warned.<p>

  Despite the candor of its collaborators and its intriguing premise, I
  cannot wholeheartedly recommend that you read these reviews.  Unless
  you are a die-hard English-major-type who enjoys reading literary
  criticism until your eyes bleed, you are not likely to find anything
  here that will illuminate the inner workings of the human soul.  While
  cradled in a friendly, almost scholarly frame, these reviews are little
  more than an exercise in semantics and references.<P>

  In short, they are a waste of memory and bandwidth, and should be
  taken off the web.  I ask Sloppy to leave this review as a deterrent to
  people reading these reviews until such time as all the reviews are taken
  off (at which time, of course, my review should be removed).<P>

<h3>WebCatalog Converter<hr></h3>

I use <a href="http://www.pacific-coast.com">WebCatalog</a> on my server at work, and I
have developed a little program that will convert your tab-delimited text files into the
specific WebCatalog format.  It's quick'n'dirty, written in applescript in an afternoon,
because I needed it.  I figured someone else might make use of it, so I put it up here.<p>

(Self-extracting archive, 99K)<br>
<a href="WebCatalogConverter.sea.hqx">Click here to download</a><hr><p>
</center>

In order to use this program, you may need to install some Scripting Additions (OSAX)
and put them in the 'Scripting Additions' folder in your Extensions folder.  These are

<H1>Free Internet Account from MCI</h1>

<I>[What follows is a message from
<a href="mailto:michael@yrkpa.kias.com">Michael McPherson</a> that was
forwarded to me, through a circuitous list of forwarders,
on 07/14/95.  It regards possible free internet accounts from MCI.]</I><P>
<HR>

Date: Sat, 10 Jun 1995 23:40:42 -0400 (EDT)<BR>
From: Michael McPherson (michael@yrkpa.kias.com)<BR>
Subject: InternetMCI pricing effective August 1<P>

Knowing that some may  think this is not kidsphere
related, I am posting to the list in hopes that
a free PPP account from InternetMCI will be
educational to one and all.<P>

BTW, I am not employed by MCI.<P>

As of June 1 1995, InternetMCI is offering
free unlimited usage PPP accounts and free
supporting software[Netscape browers] to
individuals and businesses through Aug 1, 1995.<P>

The InternetMCI PPP accounts will be
accessed through local metropolitan tele #
and nationwide toll free 800 numbers.
They plan to have 50 to 60 major metropolitan
local access numbers by August 1.<P>

InternetMCI pricing effective Aug. 1, 1995
will be $9.95/mo.  Local access accounts
will get the first 5 hours/mo. free and then
billed $2.50 for additional hours.  800#
subscribers are to be billed at 11 cents/min.<P>

I was told by MCI that they will be shipping
65,000 software packages during the month of
June.  No figure was given on the number of
packages to be shipped during July.<P>

Information given by MCI is that they are
providing a dial up PPP accounts with no strings
attached.  Although, they may be limiting the free
InternetMCI access by the # of software packages
they plan to ship out per month.<P>

Call your local MCI office to request the
PPP account.  MCI divides their offices into
districts/regions and interested subscribers
should call the local MCI office tele# or
the district office's 800 # for signing
up for free PPP account.<P>

You don't have to be a MCI customer to obtain
the InternetMCI PPP account.<P>

InternetMCI subscribers will enter the internet
via MCI's home page: www.internetmci.com
[under construction...legal html is up]
where there will be links to MCI white pages
yellow pages [fee to be listed in], and
other web sites selected by MCI.<P>

Within the next week MCI will announce these services nationwide.<P>

<Title> Links Concerning Child Access on the Net</title>

<h1>Links Concerning Child Access on the Net</h1>

Currently, there is a lot of concern about children being able to access pornographic
materials on the net, legislation that is being proposed to put a stop to it, and the
consequences of such legislation to the internet community.  Below are a series of
links which address the situation, give alternatives to censorship, and provide
general guidelines and support to parents and educators who want to address
the problem of children's access to questionable material.<p>
Also see <a href="software.html">available software and resources</a>.

<ul>
<LI><a href="http://TRFN.pgh.pa.us/guest/mrstudy.html"><CITE>Marketing Pornography on
    the Information Superhighway</CITE> by

<LI>The results of Rimm's study were kept secret until
    <a href="http://www.pathfinder.com/@@WeivCAAAAAAAAMkC/time/">Time Magazine</a>

    scare across America.
<LI>The scare boulstered support for the <A href="http://www.eff.org/pub/Censorship/Exon_bill/hr1004_95.bill">
    Communications Decency Act (CDA)</A> which actually passed in the Senate thanks
    to a last-minute introduction of the 'blue book,' a book compiled by a friend of
    Senator Exon of the worst images that could be found online.  Senators afraid of
    being labelled pro-pornography passed the act 84-16.

    investigation into software and hardware alternatives to net censorship, in

<TITLE>Keeping Kids Safe in Cyberspace</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#f7d6b5">
<IMG SRC="cactus_line.gif">
<H1>Keeping Kids Safe in Cyberspace</H1>

[This is an article written by Brian Milburn of
<A HREF="http://www.solidoak.com/~solidoak">Solid Oak Software</A>,
and is copyright 1995.  It is included here with
permission.  The editorial remarks and mark-up are my own.]<P>

Cyberspace, as it has been called, is a 
vast, worldwide network of computers and 
on-line services that is accessible by 
anyone, of any age, and is growing at an 
phenomenal  rate.  Also known as the 
Information Super Highway, it travels 
through some seedy areas that parents 
should be aware of.  Just as any 
community may have undesirable areas 
that parents would have their children 
avoid, Cyberspace has its undesirable 
areas as well. The main difference is that 
children can visit these areas without ever 
stepping outside their home.<P>

The vast majority of Cyberspace is 
devoted to useful and educational 
purposes.  You have access to many 
sources of information including reference 
material, news and current events, 
magazine articles, and congressional 
records, just to name a few.  Children can 
have an invaluable source of information 
just a few mouse clicks away.  Additionally, 
children can chat with others their age, as 
well as teachers and other professionals to 
obtain help with homework assignments, 
term papers, and the like.  You can even 
connect with the White House to learn what 
Socks the cat has been up to lately.<P>

Cyberspace is easy to connect to.  
Virtually every computer sold today has a 
modem installed, and comes with 
introductory memberships to CompuServe, 
America On-Line, or Prodigy.  You can 
activate your membership quickly and 
easily, and all it takes is a credit card 
number.  Most parents who consider 
joining an on-line service do so for the 
many benefits that their families can enjoy, 
and rightly so.  Many parents however, do 
not realize that they have just opened the 
door to a vast world of information that also 
includes unrestricted adult oriented 
material.<P>

Most families who go on-line do so 
through a respected on-line service such 
as those mentioned above.  Parents are 
quickly impressed with the interest their 
children take with what they perceive to be 
a mostly educational activity, and in fact, in 
many cases the computer becomes a baby 
sitter of sorts.  Parents are generally 
pleased when their children spend less 
time watching TV and playing computer 
games and spend more time improving 
their computer skills and increasing their 
knowledge on-line.  In fact parents soon let 
their guards down and assume 
(incorrectly) that Cyberspace is a safe 
place for their children to play.<P>

While Cyberspace is indeed a 
wonderful place for children to explore, it 
has it's dangers even when using a major 
on-line service.  Currently, there are three 
major services that handle 99% of the on-
line activity generated from the home.<P>

<H2>CompuServe</H2>
CompuServe offers the user access to 
many useful features such as reference 
material, databases that cover a multitude 
if topics, product support, on-line shopping, 
sports and entertainment news, and 
special interest forums on hundreds of 
topics.  CompuServe also has several 
areas available to subscribers where adult 
oriented pictures can be downloaded, and 
areas where alternative lifestyles are 
discussed.<P>

<H2>America On-Line</H2>
America On-Line (AOL) offers much the 
same services as CompuServe, but also 
adds many more topics  that are family and 
child oriented.  AOL is monitored and 
controlled much more closely than 
CompuServe as to the content of the 
material available on-line, and any adult 
oriented material is generally much more 
conservative.  AOL also offers rooms that 
cover a wide range of interests including 
adult topics that can easily be visited by 
children.  AOL however, does give the 
parent the ability to somewhat control the 
material that their kids can have access to.<P>

<H2>Prodigy</H2>
Prodigy offers most of the features 
found in the other two on-line services, but 
is more limited in the range of features and 
areas of special interest.<P>

<H2>Internet</H2>
All three of the major on-line services 
offer Internet access.  You can also access 
the Internet directly from a large number of 
Internet providers.  Here is where the real 
danger lies.  The Internet is a huge world 
wide network of computers and services all 
connected together.  Represented are 
virtually all major corporations, government 
agencies, colleges and universities, non-
profit groups, local groups, smaller 
companies, and hundreds of thousands of 
individual users.<P>

The Internet is largely unrestricted.  It is 
a dynamic entity, and changes hourly.  
Because it is composed of so many 
different smaller entities, from so many 
different countries, regulation is next to 
impossible.  No local or federal laws could 
be easily enforced to regulate the content 
of the Internet, so it's basically an "anything 
goes" proposition.  While the undesirable 
elements
(from a parents point of view) of the Internet 
comprise a very small fraction of the total 
information available, they are 
nevertheless still there, and just as easy to 
access as any other area.<P>

The major on-line services Internet 
access features act merely as gateways to 
the Internet.  Once on the Internet, the 
standards normally imposed by the on-line 
service being used fly out the window.  
Thus, the parent who thinks that their on-
line service is safe for their children is 
wrong.  The whole worldwide Internet 
network, as well as the undesirable 
aspects are immediately available.<P>

The Internet features four main 
functions.  While there are many ways to 
use the Internet, and more functions 
available, these four are the most 
commonly used and talked about.<P>

<H3>The World Wide Web</H3>
If you have heard the term "surfing the 
net", browsing the World Wide Web 
(WWW) is what this term refers to.  The 
WWW is made up of hundreds of 
thousands of "pages" that contain text, 
graphics, and links to other pages.  Almost 
anyone who uses an Internet provider can 
publish a page, generally referred to as a 
"home page."  Any WWW browser can then 
access that home page, and any other 
pages that may be attached.  These pages 
can contain any material the publisher 
wants people to see.  Additionally, the 
WWW can be searched on any term to find 
pages that cover a topic of interest.<P>

Web browsing can keep anyone 
entertained for hours on end.  Each page 
usually has links to other pages, 
sometimes thousands of miles away, so 
you can literally embark on a world wide 
odyssey without leaving your chair.  
Parents should be aware, however, that  
variety of adult topics can be found on the 
Web, including offerings from magazines 
such as Playboy, Penthouse, and Hustler, 
as well as places to browse and purchase 
such items as marital aids and adult
videos.<P>

<H3>Newsgroups</H3>
You can think of a news group as a 
bulletin board of sorts, where users can 
exchange information, files, graphics, and 
carry on discussions on a wide variety of 
topics with others from around the world.  
Currently, there are approximately 5000 
newsgroups available for access.  Of 
these, there are about 200 devoted to adult 
oriented topics.  Of these 200, there are 
probably 50 or more devoted to the 
distribution of adult oriented pictures that 
cover everything from homosexuality to 
bestiality.  These images are readily 
accessible by anyone with Internet access.<P>

<H3>FTP Sites</H3>
FTP sites are locations on the Internet 
where the user can download files.  While 
most FTP activity is generally related to 
files that would pose no danger to children, 
there are many that feature adults only 
material.  New sites come and go daily, 
and the grapevine in the adolescent world 
knows them all.<P>

<H3>E-Mail</H3>
Electronic Mail, or E-Mail, is the act of 
exchanging private notes, memos, or 
letters electronically between two or more 
individuals.  You can exchange e-mail with 
anyone who knows your e-mail address.  
This is a very common service available 
with all on-line services, and it even allows 
you to exchange e-mail with someone who 
subscribes to a different on-line service.  
Because e-mail is generally transmitted 
and received within seconds, it is an 
extremely powerful tool for businesses and 
private parties alike.<P>

<H3>No Restrictions</H3>
The Internet has no, and can impose no 
restrictions on who accesses what area.  
Adult only areas can be accessed by 
anyone of any age regardless of what they 
may say.  For instance, the Playboy home 
page on the World Wide Web states that 
you must be 18 to enter the Playboy area 
where pictures are available for viewing.  
This is much like issuing a dare to a child.  
They do not have to provide any proof of 
their age, and there would be no way of 
verifying it even if they did.  So the over 18 
requirement rather acts as a drawing card 
advertising that there is material there they 
want to explore.  Basically, the Internet 
sees all users the same, and once on, what 
is available to one is available to all.<P>

<H3>On-Line Services and The Law</H3>
At the time of this writing, there is 
currently a bill being considered in the 
Senate and Congress commonly referred 
to as the Communications Decency Act of 
1995.  This bill and its amendments, in 
their various forms, would make all on-line 
service providers responsible for the 
content of any information available on 
their service including private e-mail.  The 
bill would provide severe penalties for 
services where "any comment, request, 
suggestion, proposal, image, or other 
communication which is obscene, lewd, 
lascivious, filthy, or indecent" is exchanged 
between any individuals, consenting or 
non-consenting, and whether public or 
private in nature.<P>

This is seen by many as censorship, 
unconstitutional, and unenforceable.  No 
matter what its final form if passed, it will 
almost certainly be challenged in court, 
and will likely have little or no effect on the 
type of material currently available.<P>

<H2>What Parents Can Do Now</H2>
<H3>Choose the right on-line service</H3>

Parents considering subscribing to an on-
line service should not be dissuaded 
because of the ability to access adult 
material.  The interesting and educational 
material available by far outweighs the 
bad, and the benefits far outweigh the 
dangers.  Parents looking for an on-line 
service should strongly consider using 
CompuServe or America On-Line.  The 
educational, reference, news, and 
entertainment material available is 
targeted mainly at families. While 
CompuServe has several areas of adult 
interest, it has the most to offer for more 
advanced and/or business users.  AOL is 
also the most heavily monitored of all the 
on-line services.  Their technicians check 
every file for content and suitability before 
any material is made available for 
download by subscribers.   AOL is also 
very diligent in its efforts to provide 
parental control features as the need 
arises.<P>

<H3>Monitor your child's on-line habits</H3>
	Parents should spend time with their 
children while they are on-line.  Have them 
give you a tour of the areas they normally 
visit.  Encourage the child to share 
conversations they have with others, and 
frequently inquire about new friends the 
child has made on-line.  Most importantly, 
parents should lay out clear ground rules 
for the child.   Let them know that there may 
be some bad people on-line, and that they 
should never give out their full name, 
address, phone, or school without parental 
permission.  They should also emphasize 
that if anyone tries to involve the child in 
any conversation that makes them 
uncomfortable, that they should 
immediately tell the parent.<P>

<H3>Impose some controls</H3>
	If the parent has concerns about what 
type of material the child is accessing, 
utilize the on-line services parental 
controls where possible.  Call the customer 
service department of your on-line service 
to find out what type of controls are 
available.<P>

<H3>Look into other methods for monitoring 
activity.</H3>
There are a few third party 
software programs available to help 
parents monitor their child's on-line activity.  
One such package is <A HREF="#cybersitter">
CYBERsitter</A> for 
Windows.  CYBERsitter gives parents the 
capability to block or be alerted to access 
to adult oriented pictures and on-line 
pornography.  It works with all on-line 
services as well as the Internet.  
CYBERsitter can be installed and 
configured by a total novice in less than 2 
minutes, and works secretly in that 
background without the child's knowledge.  
Any attempt to download or view adults 
only material will be blocked if desired, or 
the parent can elect to have the program 
simply alert them secretly to the activity.  As 
a bonus, CYBERsitter can also block 
access to specific programs such as 
games or personal files on the computer 
that the parents may want to keep children 
from accessing. CYBERsitter is available 
direct from Solid Oak Software (1-800-388-

Cyberspace can be a fun place for 
children and adults of all ages.  No matter 
what the interest, there is something for 
everybody.  It is the wave of the future, and 
parents should be encouraged to let their 
children catch the wave.  With a little 
caution and attention, parents can help to 
make Cyberspace a safe place to play.<P>

  nice summary of parental control options and some of the legislative
  history of its need.

__________________________________________________________________________
INTRODUCTION

Within the last few years the Internet has gained in popularity.  With
that growth came a whole host of mainstream issues, such as the growing
presence of children and minors on the Internet.  In order to assist
parents, legislators, educators, and the public in learning what is
available to you *today* we have put together this document.

In the solutions mentioned below, it is important to note not just
what is desirable to parents, but to free speech advocates as well.
A solution agreeable to both parties will successfully flourish, while
a solution highly unpopular with one or the other will never catch
fire in the industry due to legal challenges or customer unhappiness.

The solutions below have been judged purely on their workability.

Changes/additions/corrections should be sent to vtw@vtw.org.

__________________________________________________________________________
CURRENT METHODS

PARENTAL GUIDANCE
As will always be true, the most effective method of getting comfortable
with your child's Internet access is to guide them as a parent.  No other
human being except you knows best what is and isn't appropriate for them.
By learning to use the Internet with your child (either one of you can
teach the other) you can instill in them the values that you want them to
use when selecting material in the Internet, or on television, radio, or
in
print media.  The respect built between you and your child will function
when no one is around, and will survive software upgrades, eternally-
changing international law, and other unpredictable events.

This solution is supported as the best one by most reasonable parents
and free speech advocates.

GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTIONS
Some members of Congress have introduced legislation to criminalize
certain types of speech throughout the medium in order to shield minors
from objectionable material.  Although this plays well at the polls, it
is not effective at addressing the issue of children's access to such
material.  As long as the Internet continues to be a global network,
there will always be some one or more countries in which one can
provide material that is out of the reach of US law and flies afoul of
US expression standards.

In addition it is very difficult to write constitutional restrictions
on speech, as we have learned from almost ten years of court testing of
the Dial-A-Porn statutes.  Governmental restrictions are not the answer
to those serious about addressing the issue.

AUTHOR RATINGS SYSTEMS
On the technical side, several people have proposed "tagging" all items
on the Internet with a rating similar to the American motion picture
ratings.  This scheme is also not a workable one, since even
well-intentioned content authors will have difficulty rating their
material in a manner that agree with your values as a parent.  In
addition, malicious authors are under no pressure to rate their content
correctly if at all.  Although the next logical step would seem to be
to make rating of content a statutory requirement, this quickly
enmeshes one in all the problems described above in "Governmental
Restrictions".

PROOF OF AGE/SHIELDING SYSTEMS
Recently there has been a growth in the number of systems that require
proof of age before providing access to their content.  This system
still requires a judgement call on the part of those providing the
content.  This judgement call is by someone who has probably nothing in
common with your ideals as a parent.

In addition, because they are a content provider they have a
*disincentive* to make that judgement call impartially, since every user
that cannot see their content reduces their audience (and potential
revenues) by one person.

Similarly, many have suggested "encrypting" all traffic that might be
objectionable to minors.  Ignoring the lack of ubiquity and general
exportability of encryption, this begs the question.  Who decides what
should be encrypted?  If they assume everything, you still need to
decide who is allowed to receive the keys to decrypt the traffic.

PROPRIETARY ENVIRONMENTS
Several online systems have proprietary environments where content
is screened as being available for the lowest common denominator of
children.  You, the parent, request that your child's account be placed
into this environment.  Because you the parent are paying the service
provider for the child's account, they have an incentive to do it
correctly as opposed to the ratings systems previously presented.

The major systems are treating this option as a customer-driven feature,
fueled by requests from paying parent customers.  It is a growing market
and not likely to fade in the near future.

THIRD PARTY RATINGS SYSTEMS
This is an extremely popular method of controlling children's access to
content that has both the support of the market and free speech advocates.
In all the previous ratings systems (the proprietary system
notwithstanding)
you have only two parties, the content producer (ie author of a Web page
or a Usenet posting) and the content consumer (the child).  In the third
party ratings system the third party is an entity trusted by the parent
of the consumer (the child) who goes out on the Internet and rates pages.

The parent has specially tinkered versions of Internet access software
that understands and enforces the ratings system.  Raters could be
either the authors of the software themselves, or yet different third
parties that are chosen by the parent.  Indeed, the third party ratings
system possesses the unique quality of allowing you to choose a ratings
body that is closely principled with what you believe as a parent.

For example, the Metropolitan Community Church might wish to shield
young people from any images of sexual images involving food, but
explicitly allow pages about gay and lesbian teenage support groups.
The Christian Coalition, on the other hand, may wish to place both types
of information on their "not for children" list.

A crucial element to this is how you as a parent would want the
software configured.  Would you rather have every part of the Internet
be unavailable unless deemed "appropriate for children" by your ratings
groups?  Or would you rather have every part of the Internet deemed
"appropriate for children" unless a ratings body (that you trust to
consistently net-surf) deems it "inappropriate for children"?

Most software packages allow you to do both.  And that's the best
part: unlike other communications technologies, consumer demand has
driven entrepreneurs to produce third party ratings products far ahead
of government calls for regulation, attempting to head off the problem
before Congress feels the need to legislate a solution.  You can obtain
these products now, and in some cases, your child's school can obtain
them free of charge.

__________________________________________________________________________
APPENDICES - WHAT IS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW

PARENTAL CONTROL
Parental control (ie you giving your child guidance on what is
appropriate) has been available for hundreds of years and continues
to be the best approach to the issue of monitoring your child's
use of the Internet.

GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTIONS ON CONTENT
Federal level
       June, '95: The Senate has passed the Communications Decency Act
                  which addresses the issue from a governmental
                  restriction approach.  It does not avoid any of the
                  pitfalls described in the above section.
       July, '95: The House has passed the Internet Freedom and Family
                  Empowerment Act (420-4) which encourages industry
                  solutions and third party solutions over censorship.
                  Both bills (and other Title 18 amendments snuck in at
                  the last minute) will have to be worked out in
conference.

State level
       The following states have passed laws restricting content
       online: Connecticut (6/95), Georgia (3/95), Maryland (4/95),
       Montana (3/95), Oklahoma (4/95), Virginia (5/95)

AUTHOR RATINGS SYSTEMS
Several proposals for author self-rating of files on the Internet have
been floated.  There is no widely accepted system of author-labelling
available right now.  Here is the list of proposals we are aware of:

       "Voluntary Internet Self Rating" by Alex Stewart (riche@crl.com)
       http://www.crl.com/~riche/IVSR/proposal.html

       "KidCode" by Nathaniel Borenstein and Darren New is an Internet
       draft available at ds.internic.net in the /internet-drafts
       directory.

       KidCode: Naming Conventions for Protecting Children on the
       World Wide Web and Elsewhere on the Internet Without
       Censorship", D. New, N.  Borenstein, 06/05/1995,
       <draft-borenstein-kidcode-00.txt, .ps


PROOF OF AGE/SHIELDING SYSTEMS
Many content providers are now requiring you to have a registration on
file that proves you are over 18 before accessing their content.  Some
are using a credit card or an Internet FirstVirtual account number as
proof of age.  However the same original problem applies: what incentive
does the content provider have to keep objectionable material out of the
hands of minors?  (None; more restrictions diminish their advertising
audience.)

PROPRIETARY ENVIRONMENTS

AMERICA ONLINE (AOL) offers a parental blocking feature in their
proprietary interface that allows you the parent to block your child's
access to chat rooms that may contain objectionable material.  In
addition, the system allows you to restrict access to discussion groups
that are named with keywords you might wish to keep from your child.
For example, you could choose to restrict your child's AOL account from
seeing any newsgroup that contained the word "violence".  AOL provides
telephone help, detailed instructions and advice for parents. There is
no additional cost for this service, and, like the other parental
control features on AOL, the feature cannot be turned off without a
password known only to the parent.  AOL's parental blocking service
is free.

PRODIGY subscribers are restricted from posting messages either in
public forums or in chat rooms that are deemed inappropriate for
children.  This includes George Carlin's famous "Seven Dirty Words".
Internet access from Prodigy is not allowed except with authorization
from the parent account holder (using a credit card).  In addition,
Prodigy keeps a log of which sites the child has visited for parental
review.  Prodigy's parental control service is free.

COMPUSERVE does not yet have parental control features available, but
have announced two projects called KidNet and Internet In A Box For Kids.
KidNet is planned to be "child-safe" online service that will contain
closely monitored interactive games, shopping, messaging, and chatting
areas.
Internet In A Box For Kids will contain a program called Crossing
Guard, which will allow parents to control their children's access to the
by blocking access to sites that may contain inappropriate materials.
Crossing Guard will also allow parents to monitor their children's online
activities and set timers to control when and how long their children can
surf the net.  Both products will not available until Fall of 1995.  The
cost is not yet known.


THIRD PARTY RATINGS SYSTEMS

CYBERPATROL allows parents to restrict access to certain times of day,
limit the total time spent on-line per day and per week, block access
to specific Internet resources and sites by content (using
Cyberpartrol's objectionable sites list), block or allow specific

<H1>Low-Tech Parents Aren't Powerless</H1>

[This article appeared as a sidebar in the July 3rd, 1995
Issue of <CITE>Newsweek</CITE>.]<P>

Parents want their kids to be computer-literate, but they may not want them
surfing through the Internet's sea of smut.  It's not an either-or proposition.
With a few keystrokes, and some quality-time conversation, it's possible to keep
both generations relatively happy- and safe.  A few suggestions:<P>

<H3>Online Blocks</H3>

Many of the commercial services, like America Online and Prodigy, have
mechanisms to restrict access to areas inappropriate for kids.  If you're joining
an online service, familiarize yourself with these restrictions and use them
accordingly.<P>

<H3>Checklist</H3>

Make sure your kids know the online do's and don'ts, and consider posting them
next to the computer:<UL>
  <LI>Never give out personal information in a public area or to a stranger
  <LI>Never arrange a face-to-face meeting with another user without parental
      permission
  <LI>Always remember that the anonymity of the Net can allow people to conceal
      their age and identity
  </UL><P>

<H3>Hover</H3>

Stay in touch with what your kids are doing.  Ask to see their favorite sites; let
them teach you some Net strokes.  If you're concerned about your children's online
activities, try talking to them about it.  Make using the computer a family activity
by keeping it in the den rather than in the child's bedroom.<P>

<H3>Watch the Clock</H3>

Pay attention to the time your kids are spending online.  Excessive use of the Net,
especially late at night, may be an indication that there's a problem.<P>

<H3>Special Software</H3>

Think about purchasing screening software such as SurfWatch, which prevents the
computer on which it's loaded from accessing sites on the Internet known to contain
sexual content.  An attempt to browse the Penthouse Web page, for example, results
instead in a screen reading "Blocked by SurfWatch."<P>

<H3>You're Not Alone</H3>

PTAs and parent groups around the nation are trading advice and offering support.
Also, talk to your neighbors: your efforts are worthless if the kid next door has
no limits.  For a detailed brochure on the Information Highway's hazards, call the
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at 1-800-THE-LOST.<P>

<H1>Screening Software for Parents and Teachers</H1>

Below is a list of software that is available to parents and teachers for the
purposes of monitoring or barring access to certain web sites or documents.<P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="http://www.solidoak.com/~solidoak">SolidOak's CYBERsitter</A> is
      a program which watches for various file types, and blocks or records for
      later inspection attempts to view files of that type.  It is good for
      monitoring what .gif files are being downloaded, and blocking .gif viewing
      if there is a problem.  It does not prevent access to text or unpopular
      file types.  Windows only.
  <LI><A HREF="http://www.surfwatch.com/surfwatch/">SurfWatch's SurfWatch</A> is
      a program which works through the TCP/IP software and contains an internal

      site causes the database to be searched, and if a hit is made, the connection
      is locally blocked.  Requires a subscription to maintain the database (since
      new sites are continually cropping up).  It is not for use with OnLine
      services, however.  Currently, the list of sites is uneditable, and is the
      subjective opinion of surfwatch.  However, they are working on a software

      computer (or simply logs the entry) whenever something in the database is
      entered.  While this may effectively block much of the internet traffic, it
      is probable that plenty can get through, since it is possible to find
      questionable material simply by clicking, and parents may not anticipate
      certain keywords their children may use.  We have a <a href="nannyblurb.html">

<h1>Inventions</h1>

To provide our students with the opportunity to discover the creative process and
learn about the ever changing world of inventions and discoveries, Team 6C chose
<I>Inventions</I> as an interdisciplinary unit.  This unit covers a two week period.
The students create a math game, create an invention, research an inventor, present
their findings and creations, and visit the <B>New Mexico State University Advance
Manufacturing Center</B>.  Types of technology to be utilized by teachers and/or
students in this unit include the use of laser disc, VCR, LCD panel, and computer
programs (<I>Hyperstudio</I>, word processing program, drawing program, and Internet).<P>

The objectives for this unit are for students:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>  to develop an understanding of the invention process;<BR>
<LI>  to develop an appreciation for the success and failures involved in inventing;<BR>
<LI>  to utilize a variety of technology tools in generating reports, presentations, and projects; and<BR>
<LI>  to develop and practice research skills.<BR>
</UL><p>

The students will be evaluated by:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>  teacher observation<BR>
<LI>  classroom participation<BR>
<LI>  reports and projects<BR>
<LI>  teacher generated tests

     On Developing an Interdisiplinary<br>

        Thematic Unit Utilizing Technology<br>

                   for Middle School</h2></center>

<hr>

     This year at Sierra Middle School in Las Cruces, NM, as a part of individual

teachers professional development plan teachers were asked to develop and utilize

two interdisciplinary units of study for their team.  Each team in our building

includes instructors of all required subject areas.  For example, our sixth grade

team includes teachers of science, math, language arts, social studies, and

exploratories in humanities and technology with each teacher also teaching an

advisory period.

<p>

     Since environment is one of the major subject areas in our curriculum and we

live in the desert which is rich with subject matter for all subject areas, our

team selected The Living Desert: the land and its people as one of our units. 

This was also an opportunity to explore the cultural background of our large

number of bi-lingual students.

<p>

     Another goal while planning our unit was to incorporate as many technology

tools, materials, and resources as possible which were available to us.  As we

were also participants in a USWEST Grant; materials, technology training and

support from New Mexico State University staff were made available to us.

<p>

     After selecting our unit and setting goals, each teacher then began

researching their areas of specialties and brought ideas and materials to our

team meetings to share.   Since some of our teachers teach more than one subject

area, our next step was for all teachers of a particular subject area to meet and

develop lesson plans.  Plans were then brought back to team meeting and

coordinated with each other to provide continuity  through out the team.  The

USWEST grant provided us with support and help from NMSU professor Karin Wiberg,

university technology training, hardware and related software for the team to use

in this project which overall helped make it such a success.

<p>

     The benefits of this program were tremendous!  Up to now our team handled

functional tasks during our daily team meeting time such as discipline, team

reports, student and parent conferences and school communications.  For the first

time were interacting on a professional level with each other and developed new

perspectives and respect for the teaching talents in our group.  It brought us

much closer together and for the first time we even incorporated many community

members.  It truly strengthened our team by focusing on both student and teacher

learning!!

<p>

     The students were very enthusiastic about the unit of study.  They liked the

continuity of instruction across the curriculum.  Teachers coordinated the

activities, projects and major assignments.  Thus, students could concentrate and

devote more time and effort on assignments and would then produce better results.

 We saw an improvement in the students overall interest, attention and grades.

<p>

     On evaluating the unit upon completion, students and teachers felt it was

very successful.  We are already planning and looking forward to new units of

study for our team.  During future planning sessions, we would also like to look

at the possibility of including students in the planning process to include a new

dimension in the process.  We hope you will find ideas and information which

could be useful in your instructional program.

<H1>Free Internet Account from MCI</h1>

<I>[What follows is a message from
<a href="mailto:michael@yrkpa.kias.com">Michael McPherson</a> that was
forwarded to me, through a circuitous list of forwarders,
on 07/14/95.  It regards possible free internet accounts from MCI.]</I><P>
<HR>

Date: Sat, 10 Jun 1995 23:40:42 -0400 (EDT)<BR>
From: Michael McPherson (michael@yrkpa.kias.com)<BR>
Subject: InternetMCI pricing effective August 1<P>

Knowing that some may  think this is not kidsphere
related, I am posting to the list in hopes that
a free PPP account from InternetMCI will be
educational to one and all.<P>

BTW, I am not employed by MCI.<P>

As of June 1 1995, InternetMCI is offering
free unlimited usage PPP accounts and free
supporting software[Netscape browers] to
individuals and businesses through Aug 1, 1995.<P>

The InternetMCI PPP accounts will be
accessed through local metropolitan tele #
and nationwide toll free 800 numbers.
They plan to have 50 to 60 major metropolitan
local access numbers by August 1.<P>

InternetMCI pricing effective Aug. 1, 1995
will be $9.95/mo.  Local access accounts
will get the first 5 hours/mo. free and then
billed $2.50 for additional hours.  800#
subscribers are to be billed at 11 cents/min.<P>

I was told by MCI that they will be shipping
65,000 software packages during the month of
June.  No figure was given on the number of
packages to be shipped during July.<P>

Information given by MCI is that they are
providing a dial up PPP accounts with no strings
attached.  Although, they may be limiting the free
InternetMCI access by the # of software packages
they plan to ship out per month.<P>

Call your local MCI office to request the
PPP account.  MCI divides their offices into
districts/regions and interested subscribers
should call the local MCI office tele# or
the district office's 800 # for signing
up for free PPP account.<P>

You don't have to be a MCI customer to obtain
the InternetMCI PPP account.<P>

InternetMCI subscribers will enter the internet
via MCI's home page: www.internetmci.com
[under construction...legal html is up]
where there will be links to MCI white pages
yellow pages [fee to be listed in], and
other web sites selected by MCI.<P>

Within the next week MCI will announce these services nationwide.<P>

<Title> Links Concerning Child Access on the Net</title>

<h1>Links Concerning Child Access on the Net</h1>

Currently, there is a lot of concern about children being able to access pornographic
materials on the net, legislation that is being proposed to put a stop to it, and the
consequences of such legislation to the internet community.  Below are a series of
links which address the situation, give alternatives to censorship, and provide
general guidelines and support to parents and educators who want to address
the problem of children's access to questionable material.<p>
Also see <a href="software.html">available software and resources</a>.

<ul>
<LI><a href="http://TRFN.pgh.pa.us/guest/mrstudy.html"><CITE>Marketing Pornography on
    the Information Superhighway</CITE> by
    Martin Rimm</A>, the questionable and controversial study that 'exposed' the
    amount of pornography on the internet.
<LI>The results of Rimm's study were kept secret until
    <a href="http://www.pathfinder.com/@@WeivCAAAAAAAAMkC/time/">Time Magazine</a>
    could publish its infamous article,

    <CITE>Porn on the Internet</CITE></a>, an article that began a major internet
    scare across America.
<LI>The scare boulstered support for the <A href="http://www.eff.org/pub/Censorship/Exon_bill/hr1004_95.bill">
    Communications Decency Act (CDA)</A> which actually passed in the Senate thanks
    to a last-minute introduction of the 'blue book,' a book compiled by a friend of
    Senator Exon of the worst images that could be found online.  Senators afraid of
    being labelled pro-pornography passed the act 84-16.
<LI>A <a href="http://www.cdt.org/petition.html">Petition</A> to request more
    investigation into software and hardware alternatives to net censorship, in
    <A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/cda.html">reaction</A> to the controversial
    Communications Decency Act.  The petition has been initiated by
    <a href="http://www.cdt.org/">the Center for Democracy and Technology</A>, as
    an attempt to stop the CDA after the Senate unexpectedly passed it.  (They also
    maintain the <a href="http://www.cdt.org/cda.html">CDT Communications Decency

<TITLE>Keeping Kids Safe in Cyberspace</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#f7d6b5">
<IMG SRC="cactus_line.gif">
<H1>Keeping Kids Safe in Cyberspace</H1>

[This is an article written by Brian Milburn of
<A HREF="http://www.solidoak.com/~solidoak">Solid Oak Software</A>,
and is copyright 1995.  It is included here with
permission.  The editorial remarks and mark-up are my own.]<P>

Cyberspace, as it has been called, is a 
vast, worldwide network of computers and 
on-line services that is accessible by 
anyone, of any age, and is growing at an 
phenomenal  rate.  Also known as the 
Information Super Highway, it travels 
through some seedy areas that parents 
should be aware of.  Just as any 
community may have undesirable areas 
that parents would have their children 
avoid, Cyberspace has its undesirable 
areas as well. The main difference is that 
children can visit these areas without ever 
stepping outside their home.<P>

The vast majority of Cyberspace is 
devoted to useful and educational 
purposes.  You have access to many 
sources of information including reference 
material, news and current events, 
magazine articles, and congressional 
records, just to name a few.  Children can 
have an invaluable source of information 
just a few mouse clicks away.  Additionally, 
children can chat with others their age, as 
well as teachers and other professionals to 
obtain help with homework assignments, 
term papers, and the like.  You can even 
connect with the White House to learn what 
Socks the cat has been up to lately.<P>

Cyberspace is easy to connect to.  
Virtually every computer sold today has a 
modem installed, and comes with 
introductory memberships to CompuServe, 
America On-Line, or Prodigy.  You can 
activate your membership quickly and 
easily, and all it takes is a credit card 
number.  Most parents who consider 
joining an on-line service do so for the 
many benefits that their families can enjoy, 
and rightly so.  Many parents however, do 
not realize that they have just opened the 
door to a vast world of information that also 
includes unrestricted adult oriented 
material.<P>

Most families who go on-line do so 
through a respected on-line service such 
as those mentioned above.  Parents are 
quickly impressed with the interest their 
children take with what they perceive to be 
a mostly educational activity, and in fact, in 
many cases the computer becomes a baby 
sitter of sorts.  Parents are generally 
pleased when their children spend less 
time watching TV and playing computer 
games and spend more time improving 
their computer skills and increasing their 
knowledge on-line.  In fact parents soon let 
their guards down and assume 
(incorrectly) that Cyberspace is a safe 
place for their children to play.<P>

While Cyberspace is indeed a 
wonderful place for children to explore, it 
has it's dangers even when using a major 
on-line service.  Currently, there are three 
major services that handle 99% of the on-
line activity generated from the home.<P>

<H2>CompuServe</H2>
CompuServe offers the user access to 
many useful features such as reference 
material, databases that cover a multitude 
if topics, product support, on-line shopping, 
sports and entertainment news, and 
special interest forums on hundreds of 
topics.  CompuServe also has several 
areas available to subscribers where adult 
oriented pictures can be downloaded, and 
areas where alternative lifestyles are 
discussed.<P>

<H2>America On-Line</H2>
America On-Line (AOL) offers much the 
same services as CompuServe, but also 
adds many more topics  that are family and 
child oriented.  AOL is monitored and 
controlled much more closely than 
CompuServe as to the content of the 
material available on-line, and any adult 
oriented material is generally much more 
conservative.  AOL also offers rooms that 
cover a wide range of interests including 
adult topics that can easily be visited by 
children.  AOL however, does give the 
parent the ability to somewhat control the 
material that their kids can have access to.<P>

<H2>Prodigy</H2>
Prodigy offers most of the features 
found in the other two on-line services, but 
is more limited in the range of features and 
areas of special interest.<P>

<H2>Internet</H2>
All three of the major on-line services 
offer Internet access.  You can also access 
the Internet directly from a large number of 
Internet providers.  Here is where the real 
danger lies.  The Internet is a huge world 
wide network of computers and services all 
connected together.  Represented are 
virtually all major corporations, government 
agencies, colleges and universities, non-
profit groups, local groups, smaller 
companies, and hundreds of thousands of 
individual users.<P>

The Internet is largely unrestricted.  It is 
a dynamic entity, and changes hourly.  
Because it is composed of so many 
different smaller entities, from so many 
different countries, regulation is next to 
impossible.  No local or federal laws could 
be easily enforced to regulate the content 
of the Internet, so it's basically an "anything 
goes" proposition.  While the undesirable 
elements
(from a parents point of view) of the Internet 
comprise a very small fraction of the total 
information available, they are 
nevertheless still there, and just as easy to 
access as any other area.<P>

The major on-line services Internet 
access features act merely as gateways to 
the Internet.  Once on the Internet, the 
standards normally imposed by the on-line 
service being used fly out the window.  
Thus, the parent who thinks that their on-
line service is safe for their children is 
wrong.  The whole worldwide Internet 
network, as well as the undesirable 
aspects are immediately available.<P>

The Internet features four main 
functions.  While there are many ways to 
use the Internet, and more functions 
available, these four are the most 
commonly used and talked about.<P>

<H3>The World Wide Web</H3>
If you have heard the term "surfing the 
net", browsing the World Wide Web 
(WWW) is what this term refers to.  The 
WWW is made up of hundreds of 
thousands of "pages" that contain text, 
graphics, and links to other pages.  Almost 
anyone who uses an Internet provider can 
publish a page, generally referred to as a 
"home page."  Any WWW browser can then 
access that home page, and any other 
pages that may be attached.  These pages 
can contain any material the publisher 
wants people to see.  Additionally, the 
WWW can be searched on any term to find 
pages that cover a topic of interest.<P>

Web browsing can keep anyone 
entertained for hours on end.  Each page 
usually has links to other pages, 
sometimes thousands of miles away, so 
you can literally embark on a world wide 
odyssey without leaving your chair.  
Parents should be aware, however, that  
variety of adult topics can be found on the 
Web, including offerings from magazines 
such as Playboy, Penthouse, and Hustler, 
as well as places to browse and purchase 
such items as marital aids and adult
videos.<P>

<H3>Newsgroups</H3>
You can think of a news group as a 
bulletin board of sorts, where users can 
exchange information, files, graphics, and 
carry on discussions on a wide variety of 
topics with others from around the world.  
Currently, there are approximately 5000 
newsgroups available for access.  Of 
these, there are about 200 devoted to adult 
oriented topics.  Of these 200, there are 
probably 50 or more devoted to the 
distribution of adult oriented pictures that 
cover everything from homosexuality to 
bestiality.  These images are readily 
accessible by anyone with Internet access.<P>

<H3>FTP Sites</H3>
FTP sites are locations on the Internet 
where the user can download files.  While 
most FTP activity is generally related to 
files that would pose no danger to children, 
there are many that feature adults only 
material.  New sites come and go daily, 
and the grapevine in the adolescent world 
knows them all.<P>

<H3>E-Mail</H3>
Electronic Mail, or E-Mail, is the act of 
exchanging private notes, memos, or 
letters electronically between two or more 
individuals.  You can exchange e-mail with 
anyone who knows your e-mail address.  
This is a very common service available 
with all on-line services, and it even allows 
you to exchange e-mail with someone who 
subscribes to a different on-line service.  
Because e-mail is generally transmitted 
and received within seconds, it is an 
extremely powerful tool for businesses and 
private parties alike.<P>

<H3>No Restrictions</H3>
The Internet has no, and can impose no 
restrictions on who accesses what area.  
Adult only areas can be accessed by 
anyone of any age regardless of what they 
may say.  For instance, the Playboy home 
page on the World Wide Web states that 
you must be 18 to enter the Playboy area 
where pictures are available for viewing.  
This is much like issuing a dare to a child.  
They do not have to provide any proof of 
their age, and there would be no way of 
verifying it even if they did.  So the over 18 
requirement rather acts as a drawing card 
advertising that there is material there they 
want to explore.  Basically, the Internet 
sees all users the same, and once on, what 
is available to one is available to all.<P>

<H3>On-Line Services and The Law</H3>
At the time of this writing, there is 
currently a bill being considered in the 
Senate and Congress commonly referred 
to as the Communications Decency Act of 
1995.  This bill and its amendments, in 
their various forms, would make all on-line 
service providers responsible for the 
content of any information available on 
their service including private e-mail.  The 
bill would provide severe penalties for 
services where "any comment, request, 
suggestion, proposal, image, or other 
communication which is obscene, lewd, 
lascivious, filthy, or indecent" is exchanged 
between any individuals, consenting or 
non-consenting, and whether public or 
private in nature.<P>

This is seen by many as censorship, 
unconstitutional, and unenforceable.  No 
matter what its final form if passed, it will 
almost certainly be challenged in court, 
and will likely have little or no effect on the 
type of material currently available.<P>

<H2>What Parents Can Do Now</H2>
<H3>Choose the right on-line service</H3>

Parents considering subscribing to an on-
line service should not be dissuaded 
because of the ability to access adult 
material.  The interesting and educational 
material available by far outweighs the 
bad, and the benefits far outweigh the 
dangers.  Parents looking for an on-line 
service should strongly consider using 
CompuServe or America On-Line.  The 
educational, reference, news, and 
entertainment material available is 
targeted mainly at families. While 
CompuServe has several areas of adult 
interest, it has the most to offer for more 
advanced and/or business users.  AOL is 
also the most heavily monitored of all the 
on-line services.  Their technicians check 
every file for content and suitability before 
any material is made available for 
download by subscribers.   AOL is also 
very diligent in its efforts to provide 
parental control features as the need 
arises.<P>

<H3>Monitor your child's on-line habits</H3>
	Parents should spend time with their 
children while they are on-line.  Have them 
give you a tour of the areas they normally 
visit.  Encourage the child to share 
conversations they have with others, and 
frequently inquire about new friends the 
child has made on-line.  Most importantly, 
parents should lay out clear ground rules 
for the child.   Let them know that there may 
be some bad people on-line, and that they 
should never give out their full name, 
address, phone, or school without parental 
permission.  They should also emphasize 
that if anyone tries to involve the child in 
any conversation that makes them 
uncomfortable, that they should 
immediately tell the parent.<P>

<H3>Impose some controls</H3>
	If the parent has concerns about what 
type of material the child is accessing, 
utilize the on-line services parental 
controls where possible.  Call the customer 
service department of your on-line service 
to find out what type of controls are 
available.<P>

<H3>Look into other methods for monitoring 
activity.</H3>
There are a few third party 
software programs available to help 
parents monitor their child's on-line activity.  
One such package is <A HREF="#cybersitter">
CYBERsitter</A> for 
Windows.  CYBERsitter gives parents the 
capability to block or be alerted to access 
to adult oriented pictures and on-line 
pornography.  It works with all on-line 
services as well as the Internet.  
CYBERsitter can be installed and 
configured by a total novice in less than 2 
minutes, and works secretly in that 
background without the child's knowledge.  
Any attempt to download or view adults 
only material will be blocked if desired, or 
the parent can elect to have the program 
simply alert them secretly to the activity.  As 
a bonus, CYBERsitter can also block 
access to specific programs such as 
games or personal files on the computer 
that the parents may want to keep children 
from accessing. CYBERsitter is available 
direct from Solid Oak Software (1-800-388-
2761 or 805-967-9853) for less than $30.<P>

Cyberspace can be a fun place for 
children and adults of all ages.  No matter 
what the interest, there is something for 
everybody.  It is the wave of the future, and 
parents should be encouraged to let their 
children catch the wave.  With a little 
caution and attention, parents can help to 
make Cyberspace a safe place to play.<P>

__________________________________________________________________________
INTRODUCTION

Within the last few years the Internet has gained in popularity.  With
that growth came a whole host of mainstream issues, such as the growing
presence of children and minors on the Internet.  In order to assist
parents, legislators, educators, and the public in learning what is
available to you *today* we have put together this document.

In the solutions mentioned below, it is important to note not just
what is desirable to parents, but to free speech advocates as well.
A solution agreeable to both parties will successfully flourish, while
a solution highly unpopular with one or the other will never catch
fire in the industry due to legal challenges or customer unhappiness.

The solutions below have been judged purely on their workability.

Changes/additions/corrections should be sent to vtw@vtw.org.

__________________________________________________________________________
CURRENT METHODS

PARENTAL GUIDANCE
As will always be true, the most effective method of getting comfortable
with your child's Internet access is to guide them as a parent.  No other
human being except you knows best what is and isn't appropriate for them.
By learning to use the Internet with your child (either one of you can
teach the other) you can instill in them the values that you want them to
use when selecting material in the Internet, or on television, radio, or
in
print media.  The respect built between you and your child will function
when no one is around, and will survive software upgrades, eternally-
changing international law, and other unpredictable events.

This solution is supported as the best one by most reasonable parents
and free speech advocates.

GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTIONS
Some members of Congress have introduced legislation to criminalize
certain types of speech throughout the medium in order to shield minors
from objectionable material.  Although this plays well at the polls, it
is not effective at addressing the issue of children's access to such
material.  As long as the Internet continues to be a global network,
there will always be some one or more countries in which one can
provide material that is out of the reach of US law and flies afoul of
US expression standards.

In addition it is very difficult to write constitutional restrictions
on speech, as we have learned from almost ten years of court testing of
the Dial-A-Porn statutes.  Governmental restrictions are not the answer
to those serious about addressing the issue.

AUTHOR RATINGS SYSTEMS
On the technical side, several people have proposed "tagging" all items
on the Internet with a rating similar to the American motion picture
ratings.  This scheme is also not a workable one, since even
well-intentioned content authors will have difficulty rating their
material in a manner that agree with your values as a parent.  In
addition, malicious authors are under no pressure to rate their content
correctly if at all.  Although the next logical step would seem to be
to make rating of content a statutory requirement, this quickly
enmeshes one in all the problems described above in "Governmental
Restrictions".

PROOF OF AGE/SHIELDING SYSTEMS
Recently there has been a growth in the number of systems that require
proof of age before providing access to their content.  This system
still requires a judgement call on the part of those providing the
content.  This judgement call is by someone who has probably nothing in
common with your ideals as a parent.

In addition, because they are a content provider they have a
*disincentive* to make that judgement call impartially, since every user
that cannot see their content reduces their audience (and potential
revenues) by one person.

Similarly, many have suggested "encrypting" all traffic that might be
objectionable to minors.  Ignoring the lack of ubiquity and general
exportability of encryption, this begs the question.  Who decides what
should be encrypted?  If they assume everything, you still need to
decide who is allowed to receive the keys to decrypt the traffic.

PROPRIETARY ENVIRONMENTS
Several online systems have proprietary environments where content
is screened as being available for the lowest common denominator of
children.  You, the parent, request that your child's account be placed
into this environment.  Because you the parent are paying the service
provider for the child's account, they have an incentive to do it
correctly as opposed to the ratings systems previously presented.

The major systems are treating this option as a customer-driven feature,
fueled by requests from paying parent customers.  It is a growing market
and not likely to fade in the near future.

THIRD PARTY RATINGS SYSTEMS
This is an extremely popular method of controlling children's access to
content that has both the support of the market and free speech advocates.
In all the previous ratings systems (the proprietary system
notwithstanding)
you have only two parties, the content producer (ie author of a Web page
or a Usenet posting) and the content consumer (the child).  In the third
party ratings system the third party is an entity trusted by the parent
of the consumer (the child) who goes out on the Internet and rates pages.

The parent has specially tinkered versions of Internet access software
that understands and enforces the ratings system.  Raters could be
either the authors of the software themselves, or yet different third
parties that are chosen by the parent.  Indeed, the third party ratings
system possesses the unique quality of allowing you to choose a ratings
body that is closely principled with what you believe as a parent.

For example, the Metropolitan Community Church might wish to shield
young people from any images of sexual images involving food, but
explicitly allow pages about gay and lesbian teenage support groups.
The Christian Coalition, on the other hand, may wish to place both types
of information on their "not for children" list.

A crucial element to this is how you as a parent would want the
software configured.  Would you rather have every part of the Internet
be unavailable unless deemed "appropriate for children" by your ratings
groups?  Or would you rather have every part of the Internet deemed
"appropriate for children" unless a ratings body (that you trust to
consistently net-surf) deems it "inappropriate for children"?

Most software packages allow you to do both.  And that's the best
part: unlike other communications technologies, consumer demand has
driven entrepreneurs to produce third party ratings products far ahead
of government calls for regulation, attempting to head off the problem
before Congress feels the need to legislate a solution.  You can obtain
these products now, and in some cases, your child's school can obtain
them free of charge.

__________________________________________________________________________
APPENDICES - WHAT IS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW

PARENTAL CONTROL
Parental control (ie you giving your child guidance on what is
appropriate) has been available for hundreds of years and continues
to be the best approach to the issue of monitoring your child's
use of the Internet.

GOVERNMENTAL RESTRICTIONS ON CONTENT
Federal level
       June, '95: The Senate has passed the Communications Decency Act
                  which addresses the issue from a governmental
                  restriction approach.  It does not avoid any of the
                  pitfalls described in the above section.
       July, '95: The House has passed the Internet Freedom and Family
                  Empowerment Act (420-4) which encourages industry
                  solutions and third party solutions over censorship.
                  Both bills (and other Title 18 amendments snuck in at
                  the last minute) will have to be worked out in
conference.

State level
       The following states have passed laws restricting content
       online: Connecticut (6/95), Georgia (3/95), Maryland (4/95),
       Montana (3/95), Oklahoma (4/95), Virginia (5/95)

AUTHOR RATINGS SYSTEMS
Several proposals for author self-rating of files on the Internet have
been floated.  There is no widely accepted system of author-labelling
available right now.  Here is the list of proposals we are aware of:

       "Voluntary Internet Self Rating" by Alex Stewart (riche@crl.com)
       http://www.crl.com/~riche/IVSR/proposal.html

       "KidCode" by Nathaniel Borenstein and Darren New is an Internet
       draft available at ds.internic.net in the /internet-drafts
       directory.

       KidCode: Naming Conventions for Protecting Children on the
       World Wide Web and Elsewhere on the Internet Without
       Censorship", D. New, N.  Borenstein, 06/05/1995,
       <draft-borenstein-kidcode-00.txt, .ps


PROOF OF AGE/SHIELDING SYSTEMS
Many content providers are now requiring you to have a registration on
file that proves you are over 18 before accessing their content.  Some
are using a credit card or an Internet FirstVirtual account number as
proof of age.  However the same original problem applies: what incentive
does the content provider have to keep objectionable material out of the
hands of minors?  (None; more restrictions diminish their advertising
audience.)

PROPRIETARY ENVIRONMENTS

AMERICA ONLINE (AOL) offers a parental blocking feature in their
proprietary interface that allows you the parent to block your child's
access to chat rooms that may contain objectionable material.  In
addition, the system allows you to restrict access to discussion groups
that are named with keywords you might wish to keep from your child.
For example, you could choose to restrict your child's AOL account from
seeing any newsgroup that contained the word "violence".  AOL provides
telephone help, detailed instructions and advice for parents. There is
no additional cost for this service, and, like the other parental
control features on AOL, the feature cannot be turned off without a
password known only to the parent.  AOL's parental blocking service
is free.

PRODIGY subscribers are restricted from posting messages either in
public forums or in chat rooms that are deemed inappropriate for
children.  This includes George Carlin's famous "Seven Dirty Words".
Internet access from Prodigy is not allowed except with authorization
from the parent account holder (using a credit card).  In addition,
Prodigy keeps a log of which sites the child has visited for parental
review.  Prodigy's parental control service is free.

COMPUSERVE does not yet have parental control features available, but
have announced two projects called KidNet and Internet In A Box For Kids.
KidNet is planned to be "child-safe" online service that will contain
closely monitored interactive games, shopping, messaging, and chatting
areas.
Internet In A Box For Kids will contain a program called Crossing
Guard, which will allow parents to control their children's access to the
by blocking access to sites that may contain inappropriate materials.
Crossing Guard will also allow parents to monitor their children's online
activities and set timers to control when and how long their children can
surf the net.  Both products will not available until Fall of 1995.  The
cost is not yet known.


THIRD PARTY RATINGS SYSTEMS

CYBERPATROL allows parents to restrict access to certain times of day,
limit the total time spent on-line per day and per week, block access
to specific Internet resources and sites by content (using
Cyberpartrol's objectionable sites list), block or allow specific

<H1>Low-Tech Parents Aren't Powerless</H1>

[This article appeared as a sidebar in the July 3rd, 1995
Issue of <CITE>Newsweek</CITE>.]<P>

Parents want their kids to be computer-literate, but they may not want them
surfing through the Internet's sea of smut.  It's not an either-or proposition.
With a few keystrokes, and some quality-time conversation, it's possible to keep
both generations relatively happy- and safe.  A few suggestions:<P>

<H3>Online Blocks</H3>

Many of the commercial services, like America Online and Prodigy, have
mechanisms to restrict access to areas inappropriate for kids.  If you're joining
an online service, familiarize yourself with these restrictions and use them
accordingly.<P>

<H3>Checklist</H3>

Make sure your kids know the online do's and don'ts, and consider posting them
next to the computer:<UL>
  <LI>Never give out personal information in a public area or to a stranger
  <LI>Never arrange a face-to-face meeting with another user without parental
      permission
  <LI>Always remember that the anonymity of the Net can allow people to conceal
      their age and identity
  </UL><P>

<H3>Hover</H3>

Stay in touch with what your kids are doing.  Ask to see their favorite sites; let
them teach you some Net strokes.  If you're concerned about your children's online
activities, try talking to them about it.  Make using the computer a family activity
by keeping it in the den rather than in the child's bedroom.<P>

<H3>Watch the Clock</H3>

Pay attention to the time your kids are spending online.  Excessive use of the Net,
especially late at night, may be an indication that there's a problem.<P>

<H3>Special Software</H3>

Think about purchasing screening software such as SurfWatch, which prevents the
computer on which it's loaded from accessing sites on the Internet known to contain
sexual content.  An attempt to browse the Penthouse Web page, for example, results
instead in a screen reading "Blocked by SurfWatch."<P>

<H3>You're Not Alone</H3>

PTAs and parent groups around the nation are trading advice and offering support.
Also, talk to your neighbors: your efforts are worthless if the kid next door has
no limits.  For a detailed brochure on the Information Highway's hazards, call the
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at 1-800-THE-LOST.<P>

<H1>Screening Software for Parents and Teachers</H1>

Below is a list of software that is available to parents and teachers for the
purposes of monitoring or barring access to certain web sites or documents.<P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="http://www.solidoak.com/~solidoak">SolidOak's CYBERsitter</A> is
      a program which watches for various file types, and blocks or records for
      later inspection attempts to view files of that type.  It is good for
      monitoring what .gif files are being downloaded, and blocking .gif viewing
      if there is a problem.  It does not prevent access to text or unpopular
      file types.  Windows only.
  <LI><A HREF="http://www.surfwatch.com/surfwatch/">SurfWatch's SurfWatch</A> is
      a program which works through the TCP/IP software and contains an internal
      database of sites with questionable material.  Attempts to connect to a
      site causes the database to be searched, and if a hit is made, the connection
      is locally blocked.  Requires a subscription to maintain the database (since
      new sites are continually cropping up).  It is not for use with OnLine
      services, however.  Currently, the list of sites is uneditable, and is the
      subjective opinion of surfwatch.  However, they are working on a software
      program to allow personal modification of the internal database.
      It has an <a href="surfeduinfo.html">educational pricing program</a>.
      Windows and Macintosh.
  <LI>Trove Investment Corporation's <a href="http://www.netnanny.com/netnanny/home.html">
      NetNanny</a> is a program which screens at the text input level.  It searches
      a parent/teacher-entered database for questionable phrases, and locks up the
      computer (or simply logs the entry) whenever something in the database is
      entered.  While this may effectively block much of the internet traffic, it
      is probable that plenty can get through, since it is possible to find
      questionable material simply by clicking, and parents may not anticipate
      certain keywords their children may use.  We have a <a href="nannyblurb.html">
      blurb</a> from them available.
  <LI><a href="http://www.spry.com/">Compuserve's</a> solution is

<H1>CAHEWUG Meeting #1<hr></H1>

This was the formative meeting of the group, and it took place on 1/18/96.<p>

<ul>
  <li>Discussed primary goals of the group:
    <ol>
      <li> Get all CAHE departments on the web
      <li> Create a framework of web-savvy contacts within the college
      <li> Advance the technical and aesthetic level of CAHE's collective pages
    </ol>
  <li>Filled out the CAHEWUG Questionnaire, in order to get an idea of where
      everyone stands.
  <li>Discussion:
    <ol>
      <li>Possibility of linking our faculty listing up with the campus
          directory for email and other contact information.  Question was
          raised that although this would not double the work, the campus
          directory often seems out of date.
      <li>We need to find out whether there is an established standard for
          web pages for the college.  (We suspect that it was handled by
          Sue Pieper before she left.)  If not, we will decide on some,
          to be derived from the base standards for the university.  As a
          part of this, we will create some 'template pages' for both
          departmental pages and faculty/staff personal pages.  The standards
          will take into consideration organizational, aesthetic, and legal
          aspects of the web pages.
      <li>I will do some research and find out procedures on getting Web
          access, and create a handout from what I find.  The handout will
          also include how much it would cost, how to go about getting it,
          a basic introduction, some reference books, etc.
      <li>I will also schedule meetings for the next two months.  The next
          meeting was scheduled for 4:00pm on Thursday, February 22nd, in
          a location to be determined later.
      <li>Things I could use from other CAHEWUG members include the URL's
          of the personal pages for faculty and staff in their departments,
          as well as any links you think might be good to have off of the
          CAHE home page.
    </ol>
  <li>Announcements:
    <ul>
      <li>CANTO training classes of interest: Internet Basics and WWW Publishing
      <li>Campus-wide WWW meeting: January 30th, SH107, 1:00-3:00pm
      <li>WWW Introductory Seminar, January 19th, Comp. Center 142, 3:00-5:00pm

<H1>CAHEWUG Meeting #2<hr></H1>

The second CAHEWUG meeting took place on 2/29/96.<p>

<ul>
  <li>We took volunteers for the Web Advisory Group, a group which will
      decide on some standards for the official departmental College pages (if
      any) beyond the University's standards.  So far, the members of this
      group are:
  <ul>
    <li>C.C. Chamberlin
    <li>Cathy Montes
    <li>Shane Ball
    <li>Tim Jones
    <li>Barbara Copeland
    <li>Allen Torell
    <li>Scott Ramsey
    <li>Mark Andersen
    <li>David Richman
    <li>Steve Loring,
    <li>Kathleen Kelsey
    <li>Wendy Hamilton
  </ul>
  
      If you want to be on this group, and you are not on the list, please
      <a href="mailto:cc@acca.nmsu.edu">let me know</a>!

  <li>I handed out a few pages of information about how to get an internet
      connection in your office and how to get connected to NMSU-NET from your
      home PC clone.  If you missed the handout, you can either drop by my
      office (GT 285) and I'll hand you one, or you can read it on the CAHEWUG
      page, at <a href="procedures.html">http://elroy.nmsu.edu/cahewug/procedures.html</a>.

  <li>I also handed out a Departmental Web Contact Form, which is basically
      a short form to let me know who to forward email messages I receive from
      people visiting the web site to.  Currently, I am forwarding to the
      CAHEWUG member in the given department.  If you want that changed,
      <a href="mailto:cc@acca.nmsu.edu">let me know</a>, and I will get one of
      these forms to you.  If you are the CAHEWUG member for your department,
      and you don't mind me forwarding you these messages, then you don't need
      to do anything.

  <li>As part of the discussion about this, it was suggested that we put on
      the CAHE page a series of buttons that people can use to contact
      specialists directly.  Steve Loring offered his database of specialists
      and their emails for this purpose, and Rena Larranaga mentioned something
      called an 'expertise guide' that we could use also.

  <li>Scott Ramsey informed us that there are plans to get all of Extension
      hooked up with internet access (probably somewhere between 14.4 and 28.8)
      by the end of May!  This will open up the counties to access information
      we put on the web.  It also means we should get someone to represent the
      counties in our user's group.  If anyone has any suggestions for who the
      appropriate person would be, <a href="mailto:cc@acca.nmsu.edu">let me know</a>.

  <li>I will be creating a 'Chihuahuan Desert' web site in the near to
      distant future, and, since I know absolutely nothing about the Chihuahuan
      Desert, I'll be needing some help from specialists.  If you have some
      expertise about the Chihuahuan Desert (geology, ecology, geography,
      photos, history, etc.), or know someone who does, <a href="mailto:cc@acca.nmsu.edu">pass
      along their email address</a> to me!

  <li>The next CAHEWUG meeting still needs a place to meet.  We're looking
      at some alternate places so that we could have a HTML primer class after
      the formal meeting.  Possibilities include the student lab on the third
      floor of GT, and the computer cluster over at Dona Ana.  We may fudge the
      date and time of the next meeting a bit to get one of these places.

  <li>Tim Jones brought up a concern about how we are going to deal with
      redundant information on the CAHE pages (for example, there are two
      places to get information on the Environmental Science program, one off
      of the main CAHE page on Elroy, and one off of the Agronomy &
      Horticulture page on Taipan (I think)).  In any case, he requested that
      we come up with some way of dealing with this redundancy, or at least
      figure out how to link the multiple copies in consistently.

  <li>If you know someone who is involved with the CAHEWUG, but is not on
      this mailiing list, please <a href="mailto:sramsey@nmsu.edu">let Scott Ramsey know</a>
      so he can add them!

<H1>Resizing Window Problem Example<hr></H1>

Below is a series of buttons, a button bar, which is meant to look like one long
snake with numbers printed on it.  It is implemented by drawing four smaller
images in a row.  It looks fine when the window is wide enough, but if you try
resizing the window so it is smaller horizontally, you'll see how the effect is
destroyed.<p>

<h2>Pruning Roses in Summer</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>   I pruned my roses this spring and they are looking
beautiful.  Now I want to know how to keep them from getting too
large this summer.  Some of them become so large that I can't get
past them.<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>   Summer pruning is done as you "dead-head" or remove the
spent blossoms.  You can also prune by cutting flowers for use
indoors or for friends.  When you remove the old blossoms, move
down the stem to the first leaf with at least five leaflets.  Do
not cut above this point.  The first leaf below the blossom
usually has only one leaflet or leaf blade.  Below that the next
leaf or two will have three leaflets.  Finally, you will reach
the leaf with five leaflets.<p>
     The reason for moving down to the five-leaflet leaf is that
the buds at the base of one- or three-leaflets is not as likely
to produce flowers; if it does, the stem will be too weak to hold
it upright.  Plants will rarely produce a stem larger than the
one from which they developed.  Pruning too close to the flower
encourages slender, weak stems will result in droopy flowers and
wind damage.<p>
     It is alright to cut below the first five-leaflet leaf if
you want some long-stemmed roses for indoor decorations.  Cutting
some long-stemmed roses or cutting old blossoms with long stems
will help keep your plant more compact.  Just don't overdo it.
When you cut the stems, you are also removing leaves which would
have produced food to strengthen the plant.  Removing too many
leaves in the summer will result in a weaker plant next year.<p>
     As in the spring you can control the form and direction of
growth by selecting buds on the side of the stem in which you
want to direct the growth of the plant.  Choose buds which grow
outward from the center of the plant and from other stems to keep
the plant healthy.  Direct growth away from walkways and walls to
protect people and the plants.<p>

<h2>Redbud Tree Question</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>   I helped a friend plant an Eastern redbud tree last year.
We prepared a large planting hole and amended the soil with a
great deal of manure and compost.  Through all of last summer it
had small leaves.  This year it is developing small leaves again.
What is wrong?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>   There could be several causes of the small leaves that you
described:<p>
<ol>
  <li> The Eastern redbud is not as well adapted to our soils and
dry air as the Oklahoma and Western redbuds.  But, there are many
Eastern redbuds doing well here.  So unless your planting site
was especially dry and well drained or the soil was extremely
salty, this is probably not the primary cause.
  <li> Salts in the soil and the manure you added around the roots
may be inhibiting
the development of a good root system which can provide enough
water to allow rapid growth and development of normal sized
leaves.
  <li> If the redbud tree was purchased in a container, or
had at one time been grown in a container, circling and
constricting roots may have developed.  These might not have been
visible at the time you planted the tree.  Such constricting
roots will limit growth and development of the tree.
  <li> There
may have been some twine left tied at the base of the tree.  Be
sure there is not plastic twine or wire tied around the tree.  As
you check for this, look just below the soil line.  Don't damage
roots, but also be looking for constricting roots.  Also look for
mechanical damage and dead bark at or near the soil line.  This
could also cause the problem.
  <li> Finally, another unlikely
cause - did you notice grubs in the soil around the tree?  Use of
considerable amounts of organic matter in the form of compost or
manure might have introduced root feeding grubs or created an
environment which allowed their development at the base of the
tree.  There are several types of grubs which are commonly found
in compost and manure.  These grubs usually cause no problem, but
if their numbers are high enough, control measures may be needed
to limit root damage.
</ol>

<h2>Horn-tail tree borers</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>   I saw the strangest thing.  I found a large wasp stuck to a
tree by its stinger.  What was that and why did it sting the
tree?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big> You probably  saw what is called a horn-tail, or horn-tail
wasp, as it was laying its eggs under the bark of the tree.  The
"stinger" is its ovipositor, or egg laying organ, with which it
can inject the eggs like it was a hypodermic needle.  The larvae
of this wasp hatch under the bark, feed on the cambium layer
under the bark, bore into the trunk and pupate until they emerge
from the tree as mature wasps.  Yes, this is a wasp which damages
trees.  You can treat with any of several products labeled for
borer control at the time the horn-tails are laying eggs or when
the adults are emerging from their pupae.<p>

     According to Dr. Charles Ward, NMSU Cooperative Extension
Service Entomologist, appropriate products include those which
contain the insecticides lindane or chlorpyrifos.  As with most
borers, the tree was probably under some environmental or
cultural stress which made it more susceptible to attack by the
horn-tails and other borers.  Stressed trees produce chemical
signals, known as kairomones, which alert the insects to the fact
that the tree is in trouble.  Such insects are natural agents
with the responsibility for removing weak or declining trees from
the environment so that younger, more vigorous trees may occupy
their place.  Unfortunately, trees in New Mexico landscapes,
especially transplanted and non-native trees, are by definition
trees growing under stress.  They are automatic targets for
insect attacks.  For this reason, it is important to properly
plant trees and irrigate them appropriately until they have
become established.  That is why native and non-native trees
adapted to our climate do better than trees which are common in
moist climates.<p>

<h2>Yellow leaves in locust trees</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big> My locust tree has a lot of yellow leaves.  I can see them
when I look up into the tree, and now they are falling.  It is
June, not autumn - is my tree sick?  What can I do to stop it?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>  While there are some diseases and insects which may cause
leaf yellowing, I suspect your tree is doing what it is supposed
to do.  When the leaves first form in the spring, the
temperatures are lower and the tree needs less water.  It
produces a lot of leaves so that it can produce as much food
through photosynthesis as possible.  As summer progresses, the
temperatures go up and the tree needs more water to sustain its
leaves.  Even if the soil contains enough moisture, there is a
limited ability of the xylem to convey water within the tree
trunk from the roots to the leaves.  Trees like the locust adapt
to this increased water demand by disposing of excess leaves.
Though this reduces the production of food through
photosynthesis, by this time the tree has already produced a
considerable amount of food to support its growth and begun to
replace that withdrawn from storage in the trunk and roots.  With
the reduced number of leaves, it will continue to make food to
supply current needs and to store for next spring when it will be
needed to support the spring growth flush.<p>

     Don't worry about your tree.  Unless other symptoms such as
twig and branch die-back or cupping of leaves develop, it is just
doing what it should.  Continue to irrigate your tree as it needs
water, every 10 to 20 days.  Water deeply and enjoy the shade.<p>

<h2>Tomato Dispute</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>      My neighbor and I have an ongoing argument.
Is it better to stake tomatoes and pinch out the suckers, or should I just
leave them alone and let them produce as many suckers as they want and let
them lie on the ground?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>   There is a third option - let them produce the suckers, but
grow them in a tomato cage.  That's my favorite.  I prefer not to
pinch out the so called suckers, branches that form at the base
of leaves.  That is extra work and reduces the number of leaves
on the plant.  Here in New Mexico the greater the number of
leaves to cover the fruit, the less damage we have from sun
scald.  Sun scald is the result of our intense sunlight shining
directly on the shoulder of the fruit and burning it.  A white
patch develops.  As it ages, it turns brown or black and fungi
begin rotting the damaged area.  This fruit is not edible, even
if you cut the damaged portion off.  The fact that fungus is
growing in it requires that, for safety reasons, you dispose of
the fruit.  Besides, it doesn't look too appetizing.<p>
     Pinching to allow only one stem results in delayed tomato
production.  Plants grown to only one stem produce fewer but
larger tomatoes.  If you are attempting to grow "bragging rights"
tomatoes, you may wish to pinch.  You will need to do something
to prevent sun scald of your monster tomatoes.<p>
     Plants allowed to sprawl on the ground are more likely to
produce rotted fruit if the fruit lie on the ground and the soil
is kept moist.  Caging helps grow plants upright, using less
space per plant and reducing fruit contact with the soil and
rotting.<p>
     Caging also allows earlier planting as the cage can be
wrapped with spun-bonded row cover material, cheese cloth, or
other material to protect against late frosts.  Other benefits
gained from wrapping the cage are wind protection and protection
from the insects that spread curly-top and tomato spotted wilt
viruses.<p>

<h2>Cucumber Vine Problems</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>   My cucumber vines aren't making cucumbers.
What am I doing wrong?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>  Maybe nothing - you may just be impatient.  Cucumbers, like
squash, pumpkins, watermelons, cantaloupes, and many other plants
produce male and female flowers separately on the same plant.
They often begin producing male flowers several weeks before the
females appear.  The males make pollen and are necessary, but
they do not produce the fruit.  Look and see if there is a little
cucumber behind the flower.  If you see the baby cucumber, you
have female flowers.  If you just see a slender stem going right
up to the back of the flower, you are looking at a male flower.<p>
     If your plants have female flowers and the fruits still
aren't setting, be sure that the plants are not drying
excessively between irrigations.  On hot days, the leaves may
wilt but should recover as the temperature drops in the evening.
If they are still wilted by morning, you are not watering enough,
or you are watering too shallowly and too often.  Be sure to
encourage deep rooting so that there are good absorbing roots
deep in the soil where they are influenced by the daily heating
of the shallow layers of soil.  A mulch may also be helpful once
the vines are large enough to be resistant to sowbug damage.
Deep watering and mulch may help.<p>
     Excessive nitrogen fertilization is also a possibility.  If
the nutrients are imbalanced, the flowers will drop.  If this is
the case, side-dressing with phosphate fertilizer will help bring
the nutrients back into balance.  To do this, use a spading fork
or otherwise make holes in the ground a few inches deep so that
the phosphate will be in the soil near the roots, not on the
surface.  Phosphate fertilizer is not as soluble as nitrogen and
cannot be washed into the soil with irrigation.  Don't use a hoe
or otherwise damage the roots of your cucumbers when applying the
phosphate.<p>
     Finally, there may be a bee problem.  Tiny parasitic mites
have attacked many of our wild bees in the state, killing the
hives.  Without bees to pollinate your cucumber flowers, you will
have to transfer pollen from the male flowers to the female
flowers by hand.  Use a cotton swab or soft bristle paint brush
to transfer the pollen.  Make sure other factors aren't the
problem first.  This involves a lot of work.<p>

<h2>Puckered Areas on Roses</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>      The leaves on my roses are developing
puckered areas.  I have noticed that these areas tend to be off-color,
not like the rest of the leaf.  Do they have a disease?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>   You may be seeing the early stages of powdery mildew
infection.  By the time you read this, it will probably have
progressed to the stage where the white, powdery spores are
apparent.  Powdery mildew can cause leaf deformation, leaf drop,
and flower deformation.  It is a common disease favored by high
humidity and temperatures in the sixties at night.  We have now
entered the season with the proper night temperatures, but many
people wonder how we have enough humidity in a drought year.  It
doesn't take extremely high humidity.  Evening or night watering
of flower beds and lawns is enough to provide the necessary
humidity.  The plants themselves create localized high humidity
as they transpire water from the leaves and trap that moisture
among the leaves.<p>
     Pruning to open the plant and allow better air movement
through the plant canopy will help reduce the powdery mildew
problem but will probably not eliminate it.  Reduced frequency of
irrigation and irrigating only in early morning will also help.
There are some fungicides intended for management of powdery
mildew on roses and other plants.  These chemicals will not cure
powdery mildew but can arrest its spread through the parts of the
plant which are not already infected.  If you choose to use one
of these, be sure to follow the directions carefully.<p>
     According to Dr. Natalie Goldberg, NMSU Extension Plant
Pathologist, there are several Fungicides available to control
powdery mildew on roses.  For those who want to use organic
materials, sulfur and bordeaux mixture will help to reduce
disease but not cure it.  Daconil and Triforine are the most
readily available of the synthetic fungicides.  She emphasizes
that even the strongest of fungicides can't eliminate the disease
once it starts.  The fungicides are useful to stop the spread of
the fungus but cannot cure what has already attacked the plant.

<h2>Fending Off Bees and Ants from Hummingbird Feeders</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>   Ants and bees are chasing the
hummingbirds from my hummingbird feeder.  What can I do to get
rid of these pests?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>  Ants can be defeated with a little work.
Coat the wire or string by which the feeder hangs with Tree
Tanglefoot (TM) or another sticky substance.  The ants will be
unable to reach the hummingbird feeder until dust or enough dead
ant bodies provide a bridge across the sticky substance.  If you
periodically wipe the dead ants and dust off and reapply the sticky
material, you can discourage the ants.  They will usually give up
after a while and go look for an easier source of food.  Be careful
not to apply the sticky material where it can get on the feathers or
feet of the hummingbirds.  Just apply it where it will discourage the
ants.<p>
     Bees may be managed in a couple of ways.  Let the
hummingbird feeder go dry for a week or so and the bees will
leave it.  Another trick is to move the hummingbird feeder
periodically.  Bees do an interesting dance in the hive to tell
other bees the direction and distance to a source of nectar.  If
you move the hummingbird feeder, the information in the dance
will be inaccurate until another bee finds it and tells the hive.
Then just move it again.  The hummingbirds find the nectar by
sight; they are attracted to the red color of the feeder.

<h2>Squash blossom-end rot</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>      I have yellow straightneck squash
that get about two and one-half inches long, then get blossom-end rot.
My white patty-pan squash get about two inches across and then dry up.
Please tell me what causes this and what to do for it.<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>   When you read the garden books and often the news articles
taken from the national news services, you will read that
blossom-end rot is due to a lack of calcium.  Gardeners familiar
with New Mexico's soils realize that our soil is not deficient in
calcium and wonder how they could get blossom-end rot.  The
answer is that though we have an excess of calcium, we have a
deficiency of water and extremely desiccating environmental
conditions.  Calcium travels through the plant in the water.  Dry
soil, hot, dry, windy days, or anything else that prevents water
from reaching all parts of the plant can limit the movement of
nutrients in the plant.  Hot, dry, windy days, or  a brief period
when the soil drys disrupts the flow of water and nutrients
through the plant.  When this happens, the small developing fruit
loose their supply of water and calcium.  As the fruit enlarges,
the brief deficiency of water and calcium becomes apparent as
blossom-end rot.<p>
     Dr. George Dickerson, Extension Horticulture Specialist for
vegetable crops, small fruits, and speciality crops, suggests
that care be taken to keep the soil evenly moist and the use of
mulches to reduce the evaporation of water from the soil.  Be
sure you don't over compensate with irrigation and keep the soil
soggy - this will cause other problems.  Shelter from the
afternoon sun and from the drying winds can also reduce the
incidence of blossom-end rot.<p>
     Dr. Dickerson also said that some diseases, including curly-
top virus can cause the symptoms you describe.  These symptoms
include fruit that fail to grow, get hard, and develop blossom-
end rot.  There may also be leaf symptoms that mimic 2,4-D
herbicide injury.  He has seen the development of these diseases
in Southern New Mexico this year.  Generally, when several plants
are growing in a row, one or a few will be affected and be
stunted compared to the others.  This helps distinguish the
disease symptoms from herbicide injury.<p>

<h2>Still time to plant</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
I was too busy this spring to plant a garden and since it
was so dry I didn't worry about planting one.  Now that it has
finally begun to rain, is it too late to plant a garden?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
 No, now is a good time to plant a number of vegetables and
flowers.  Planting in the heat of the summer is the best time to
plant crops that taste best if harvested in the cool temperatures
of autumn.  Broccoli and cauliflower are examples of vegetables
which are best harvested in the autumn.  Other plants that grow
rapidly and love heat can also be planted now.  Squash is a good
example of a vegetable that does well in the heat.<p>
     The following calculation will help you determine what you
can plant now:  Check the seed packet to determine the number of
days to frost, then look at your calendar and count the number of
days until frost is expected in your location.  Add a week or two
for harvest time and then you will know if you have time to plant
a garden.<p>
     Some crops like broccoli, kale, mustard, collards, and other
"cool-season" crops will not be killed by the first, light
frosts.  Their growing and harvest season will extend until a
hard freeze kills them.  You can cover them to protect them from
the early frosts, so they give you even more time than the
calculation we discussed would indicate.<p>
     If the monsoons persist, our high temperatures should begin
dropping and the plants should grow well.  Even if the
temperatures remain high, afternoon shade and wind protection
will help get plants going in our hot weather.<p>

<h2>Boxelder Bugs</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
We are having difficulty eradicating box elder bugs.  Do you
have any suggestions.  Would getting rid of the tree solve the
situation?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
The boxelder bugs and their close relatives, the red-
shouldered bugs, are true bugs in the order Hemiptera.  They are
black bugs with red or orange markings on their shoulders and
along the edges and ends of their wings.  They feed on the
boxelder and golden rain tree seeds causing little damage to the
trees.  They are numerous and have a bad habit of invading homes,
making a nuisance of themselves.  This is the reason most people
seek to control them.<p>
     Removing the tree can help solve the problem if there are no
other host trees nearby.  If there are other boxelder or golden
rain trees in neighboring landscapes, you will continue to have
the bugs, but they should be fewer in number.  If yours is the
only host tree in the neighborhood, your neighbors might
appreciate anything you do to eliminate the bugs.<p>
     There are several pesticides which may be used.
Insecticides containing chlorpyrifos (TM) are often used for this
purpose, but there are others also labeled for control of
boxelder bugs and their relatives.  These insecticides are much
more effective at eliminating very young bugs; the older bugs
often hide inside the seed clusters of boxelder or in the
"Chinese lanterns" around the seeds of the golden rain tree.  In
these hiding places, they are exposed to less insecticide and as
larger insects, they are less sensitive to the insecticides.<p>

<h2>Pruning Dead Branches in Summer</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
There are a lot of dead branches in my trees.  Is it ok to
prune them out now or do I have to wait until winter?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
It is wise to prune dead and dying branches from a tree
right away whenever you discover them.  They are easiest to
identify in the summer, so go ahead and prune them.  Limit
pruning of healthy branches during the growing season to those
which must be removed for safety reasons and try to prune them as
little as possible.<p>
     The very dry nature of last winter is largely responsible
for dieback in many of our trees.  It is important to remove old
dead branches as soon as possible as borers and diseases can get
their start in trees by entering through these branches left on
the tree.  Since these branches are not contributing food to the
tree through photosynthesis, it does no harm to remove them.<p>

<h2>Starting new grape vines</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
What is the technique for propagating grapes from cuttings?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
   During the summer, grapes may be propagated using leafy
cuttings.  Stems of recently matured growth cut about 18 inches
long may be rooted if they are treated with root-inducing growth
regulators and kept under high humidity.  High humidity is a
problem in New Mexico unless you build a propagation bed with a
mist system to frequently moisten the cuttings.<p>
     Use of the process called layering will probably be more
successful and may also be done in the summer.  In this method of
propagating the vines, the cutting is induced to form roots
before it is severed from the parent plant.  The vine must be
bent to the ground.  This vine should then be wounded by cutting
it slightly, girdling it, or wrapping wire tightly around the
stem.  Treat the wounded area with root-inducing chemicals and
bury the wound in good garden soil or potting soil.  After
several weeks, roots will form.  Next spring, just before growth
begins, this rooted vine may be severed from the parent plant and
moved to its permanent location.<p>
     Another form of cutting that is successful may be
accomplished in the late winter with dormant vines.  Vines about
one-half inch in diameter and one to one and one-half feet long
are severed from the plant.  The basal portion of the vine should
be treated with root-inducing chemicals.  These cuttings should
then be placed in good potting soil or garden soil so that only
one bud remains above the soil.  Keep the vines well watered, and
they should form roots as the leaves begin to develop.  By the
end of the summer or the next spring before growth begins, the
vines may be transplanted to their permanent location in the
garden.<p>

<h2>Plants won't grow, too much fertilizer</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
   Things that used to grow in my garden won't grow for me any
more.  I could grow beets and beans, but now they only grow a few
inches, turn yellow and then die.  Other things, okra, tomatoes,
and squash, do just fine.  I have tried moving my garden, still
no success.  Soil test results indicated that I had too much
fertilizer.  I stopped fertilizing, still nothing grows.  What
can I do?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>

   The soil test information provides valuable information in
identifying your problem.  You say too much fertilizer has been
applied.  That means there is an excess of fertilizer and natural
soil salts in the soil.  Fertilizers can create salty conditions
in the soil.  Beets and some other garden crops, such as beans,
are sensitive to excess salt in the soil, especially while young.
Tomatoes and some other garden crops may to be less sensitive.
If you choose to stop using commercial fertilizer and change to
manure, you can actually aggravate the problem even more rapidly.
Unless the manure has been well composted and exposed to moisture
so that the salts common in manure have been washed away, manure
can rapidly increase the saltiness of the soil.<p>
     Salts can be leached from the soil if the garden area is
heavily irrigated several times and the soil allowed to drain
well below the root zone of the crops.  Gypsum applied to the
soil before heavy irrigation can help leach some of the more
harmful salts from the soil.  In areas where drainage is poor,
leaching will not work.  The water must drain away to carry the
salts from the garden.  Addition of compost, especially compost
made without manure, can also help alleviate salt problems in the
garden.<p>

<h2>Picking ripe watermelons</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
How can I tell when my watermelons are ready to harvest?
Every year I waste several, picking them before they are ready or
waiting so long they are overripe.  Thumping them doesn't work
for me.<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
Choosing a ripe watermelon is a challenge.  In the field or
garden it is much easier than in the store because you will have
more clues.  The indications to look for in the garden are the
drying of the "pigtail" or tendril closest to the melon on the
vine.  If it dries while the leaves and rest of the vine looks
good, the melon should be ripe.  The tendril is not available to
melon hunters at the grocery store.  A second clue, which is
available at the grocery, is the color of the "ground spot," the
place where the melon rested on the soil.  If this ground spot is
yellow or a cream-yellow color, the melon is ripe.  If it is
green or white, it probably is not ripe.  The rind at the soil
spot should toughen and resist denting with a fingernail when the
melon is ripe.  Finally, for those with an ear for music or who
can easily distinguish sounds, the ripe melon will have a dull
thud when thumped, while the unripe melon will have a tighter,
ringing or hollow sound.<p>
     New Mexico State University Extension Guide H-216, "When to
Harvest Vegetables" is available at your local county Extension
office.  This publication gives guidelines for determining when
to harvest 40 common garden vegetables, including watermelons,
cantaloupes, and pumpkins.<p>

<h2>Goatheads, goatheads, goatheads!</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
Since the rains came, goathead weeds are appearing all over
my garden and lawn.  What can I do?  Can I use a preemergent
herbicide?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
Like many other weeds, goathead (called bullhead by some in
New Mexico and puncture vine by others) seeds may lie dormant in
the soil for many years until just the right conditions stimulate
its growth.  Our recent rains have provided the perfect
conditions and the goatheads are growing where they haven't been
seen growing so densely for several years.<p>
     You cannot use a preemergent herbicide to control weeds
which have already germinated.  Preemergent herbicides are to
prevent the seeds from sprouting.  Once the seeds have germinated
you will need to use mechanical control, hoeing or pulling, or a
postemergence herbicide labeled for controlling your target
weeds.<p>
     It is important to know that there is no herbicide labeled
for goathead weeds.  The name you will see listed on the
herbicide container is puncture vine.  Look for a product labeled
for post emergence control of puncture vine weeds.<p>
     Be sure to read the instructions carefully and follow the
directions.  Misuse of the herbicide can cause results you do not
intend.  Be sure it is safe to use the product you purchase in
the garden or lawn.  It should identify the environment where it
is intended to be used.  Using the herbicide in the wrong place
may result in the death of desirable plants or contamination of
food crops.<p>
     If you intend to use mechanical control techniques, be
diligent and persistent.  Learn to identify the weed in the
seedling and more mature stages.  Don't let seed form and mature.
Remove the weed every time you see it.  Don't delay.  Though you
may plan to return to the site, if you wait too long it will have
made seed and you will have problems again next year.<p>

<h2>Strange looking squash</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
In my compost pile, where everything and anything
that's biodegradable finds its way, I often dump peels and
seeds from Waltham squash, of which we consume a lot.  This
spring, to my surprise, I had a lot of squash seedlings
growing all over my garden.  These apparently came from
seeds in the compost I spread on the garden.  I kept my cool
and proceeded to transplant these seedlings into a
designated patch and I now have a bountiful crop of squash
happily growing.  But...<p>

..Maybe half of them look like honest to goodness Waltham
squash, some are huge and beautiful, but the other half is
quite different.  Some are long-necked.  Some are dark green
with lighter stripes. Some are dark green with yellow
stripes.  Others are in between.  I recall having read
someplace this is what sometimes happens when seeds from a
hybrid plant are allowed to grow again.<p>

My question is:  Are they all safely edible?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
To answer the prime question.  Yes, they should all be
edible.  However, they may not all be equal in quality.<p>

     Dr. George Dickerson, Extension Horticulture
Specialist, pointed out that Waltham is known as one of the
best quality winter squash.  He suggested that the squash
you ate may have been from a hybrid plant which had genetic
influences from other squash varieties to make them earlier,
larger, or otherwise alter their characteristics.  Plants
grown from seeds from these plants will exhibit genetic
segregation, showing varying degrees of genetic influence
from the parent plants.  Some will be excellent, of high
quality.  Others may exhibit lesser qualities such as
stringy flesh, poorer taste, or less desirable plant
characteristics, such as excessive vine growth.  All should
be edible.<p>

     If you enjoy a challenge and have sufficient garden
space, you can save the seeds from the best (you choose
which characteristics you consider best - plant
characteristics, flesh characteristics, or flavor) and plant
these seeds next year.  Over a period of years you may be
able to stabilize the variety to consistently exhibit your
chosen "best" qualities by always selecting seed from the
squash that exhibit the desired qualities.  In the interim,
you should see increases in the percentage of desirable
plants.  You must be sure that "your" squash are not cross
pollinated with pollen from other squash varieties, or the
increased variability will again be exhibited.<p>

     Results like those produced by planting seed from
hybrid squash may be seen in squash grown in a garden
containing several varieties of squash or in a garden
visited by bees from a neighboring garden growing different
types of squash.  Cross pollination will not affect the
quality of the harvested squash.  However, plants grown from
seeds of these squash will exhibit effects of the genetic
variability.<p>

     If you want consistent results each year, it is best to
buy new seed each year.  If you enjoy the surprise and
challenge presented by cross pollination, plant a few seeds
saved from the previous year's squash and see what you get.<p>

<h2>Maples don't like New Mexico</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
We live in Albuquerque and planted a red maple three
years ago. It's now about eight inches in circumference
and  12 feet tall.  It leafed out fine this year (it's
been on a  drip system and got water during our dry
winter), but now  the leaves have brown margins all
around them.  Same thing  happened last year.  I suspect
those big fat grubs that are  common in the earth could
be damaging the roots.  Help!<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
   The good news is that the problem is probably not
due to grubs.  The bad news, really bad, is that most
maples do not like New Mexico's dry air, our dry soil,
and they especially do not like the high pH and calcium
content of our soils.  The symptoms you described are
most likely due to desiccation caused by our hot dry
summer winds.<p>
     Smaller maples may be planted in locations which
provide shielding from our drying winds, but larger trees
are at the mercy of whatever New Mexico wants to throw at
them.  Most maples are just not a good choice for New
Mexico landscapes, except in very protected locations
with many surrounding trees and perhaps in the most
northern parts of the state in the mountains.  The native
big-tooth maple is better adapted than the other maples
and will do well in some parts of the state.  It has
shown itself to be adapted to Albuquerque and mountain
locations.<p>
     Another common symptom that maples exhibit in New
Mexico is iron chlorosis.  This is the yellowing of
leaves while the veins remain green.  Iron chlorosis is
due to the fact that maples and many other plants not
native to high pH soils cannot extract iron the soil.  In
severe cases, following the development of interveinal
yellowing, the leaf edges turn brown and the leaves fall
early.  In time, twig and stem dieback may occur.  While
iron applications and temporary acidification of the soil
in the root zone of affected plants may provide some
relief from the problem, in the case of trees and large
shrubs, the battle is continuous.  The problem is avoided
by using plants better adapted to our soils.<p>

<h2>Squash bugs</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
All of a sudden I have found gray bugs with black
legs on my squash plants.  They weren't there yesterday,
now they are everywhere.  What are they and are they
harmful?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
You have the infamous squash bug.  They do seem to
suddenly appear out of thin air.  They are very
debilitating to squash plants and may carry plant
diseases which compound their damaging effects.<p>
     They are difficult to control.  Mechanical control
by physically removing and killing them is one method.
Also, look for their masses of shiny brown eggs on the
underside of the lower leaves.  Smash the eggs when you
find them.  Sabadilla dust and carbaryl insecticides are
effective when the squash bugs are very young.  As the
bugs get older, the insecticides become much less
effective and mechanical control becomes the preferred
method.  If you use insecticides, follow the directions
on the label carefully to maximize their effectiveness
and safety.<p>
     Some people delay planting squash until July to
avoid the squash bug.  Dr. Charles Ward, Extension
Entomologist, warns that delayed planting will not always
be successful.  In my garden, he was correct this year.
I planted late and still suffered a squash bug attack.
Now every morning I must go on bug patrol, rubbing them
out (literally) when I find them.<p>
     Good luck!<p>

<h2>Grapeleaf skeletonizer on Virginia creeper</h2>

<img src="images/skeletonizer.jpg" height=150 width=200 alt="[Image of Skeletonizer]" align=right>
<big><b>Question:</b></big>
There are some small yellow worms eating the leaves
off my Virginia creeper.  These worms are yellow with
black and blue bands.  When they eat the leaves, they
leave behind what looks like a net.<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
You have described the appearance and the damage
done by the Western grapeleaf skeletonizer.  This is the
caterpillar of a dark gray or metallic blue moth with a
one inch wing span.  The adults lay eggs in clusters on
the leaves.  As the eggs hatch, the caterpillars begin
eating the leaf tissue between the veins on the underside
of the leaves.  The tougher veins are left behind,
creating the net-like skeleton that you described.  These
colorful caterpillars ultimately reach a length of almost
one inch.  Though this insect is called the grapeleaf
skeletonizer, it can also attack Virginia creeper and
Boston ivy, two ornamental vines which are related to the
grapes.<p>
     Since they are larvae of moths, they may be treated
with Bt if you think they are doing sufficient damage to
warrant control.  Bt is the toxin produced by the
bacterium, <i>Bacillus Thuringiensis</i>.  It may be purchased
as a powder or liquid to apply to your plants.  It is not
toxic to humans, our pets, birds, and insects other than
larvae of butterflies and moths.  Other insecticides
labeled for use on the affected plants may also be used.
A warning:  insecticides containing carbaryl can damage
Virginia creeper and Boston ivy.  Be sure to use any
products according to their directions to maximize both
safety and effectiveness.<p>
     Thank you for providing the samples.  Good specimens
of the insect and the plant on which it was feeding makes
diagnosis much easier.<br clear=all><p>

<h2>Dodder, a parasitic weed</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
There is a tangle of yellow plants with white
flowers growing in my backyard.  I can't find the
beginning where they root into the ground or their
leaves, but they are spreading across the yard.  What is
this?  Is it harmful?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
You are describing dodder, a parasitic weed.  Its
seeds germinate in the soil, the vines grow up, twine
around a nearby plant, and the dodder begins to draw
nutrition from the neighboring plant.  It has no
chlorophyll and cannot make its own food, therefore it is
yellow instead of green.  It may break its contact with
the ground as all it needs can be taken from the host
plant that it has parasitized.<p>
     If it is parasitizing weeds, the only concern is
that it not be allowed to produce seeds to germinate and
attack ornamentals or garden vegetables in a few years.
If it is in the garden, you might have to pick it off the
plants or kill the plants it is infesting to control it.
Don't let it set seeds as that will allow the problem to
continue into the future.<p>

<h2>Gophers</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
I have gophers coming out my ears.  Is there an
answer to the problem or must I move?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
Gophers can be a major problem once they move into
the neighborhood.  It is a sad fact, but there are really
no humane and effective solutions of which I am aware.
Often people who are reluctant to kill things find that
gophers can push even them over the edge.<p>
     Okay, so how do you kill a gopher?  My preference is
trapping; others prefer the poison baits or like to use
the poison gas cartridges.  Preferences are based on
which method has been successful for the person with a
preference.<p>
     Have you called your local USDA Animal Damage
Control office?  The professionals there can give you
good advice as to how to most effectively reduce gopher
problems in your area.  They may also be able to help you
obtain the traps or control chemicals you need.<p>
     There are several ways to effectively use the traps.
The method I prefer uses two traps placed in the main
tunnel.  To find the tunnel, probe the soil with a metal
rod one to one and one-half feet from the flat side of a
fresh soil mound made by the gopher.  It is surprising
how easy it is to determine when you have found the
tunnel.  Dig a hole to intersect with the gopher's
tunnel.  Place the trap into each tunnel exiting the hole
you dug.  Use wire to stake the trap outside your pit.
Then cover the hole you dug with cardboard or plywood to
exclude excess fresh air and light.  Gophers don't like
fresh air and sunlight and will come to investigate what
is going on.  When they do, they will have an encounter
with one of your traps, depending on which direction they
are coming from.  That is why you need two traps.  If
there is too much fresh air and light, the gopher will be
pushing soil to close the opening.  In that case you will
catch a bunch of dirt and no gopher.  Some people are
successful using one trap in the side tunnel which runs
from the main tunnel to the soil mound.  However, unless
you do it just right, you will catch dirt.<p>
     Baits and gas cartridges should be placed in the
main tunnel which you find in the same manner as
described before.  Baits are not always effective if
there is plenty of other food for the gophers.  Gas
cartridges may not be successful, especially in dry,
cracked clay soils or sandy soils which let the gases
escape from the tunnels.<p>
     They can tunnel quite deeply, so buried fencing is
of very little use.  It may interfere with their invasion
enough to give you time to use other control measures
before they can do too much damage, but it will not stop
the gophers.<p>
     Moving, as you suggested, may be only a temporary
solution.  Gophers are problems all over New Mexico and
some other states also have problems with moles.  As we
develop our beautiful home landscapes, we create an
environment which invites the gophers to come visit us.<p>

<h2>Pine pitch moth</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
A man stopped at my house and told me I had borers
in my pi&ntilde;on tree.  He showed me that there was a lot of
pitch coming from the tree.  He even opened a ball of
pitch and showed me the worm inside it.  He told me that
I had to have the tree sprayed or the borers would kill
it.  Did I do the right thing?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
  Based on the description of the worm, spraying was
probably not necessary.  Pi&ntilde;on trees are prolific
producers of pitch.  Pitch is used to close wounds in the
bark to prevent water loss.  Wind cracks caused when the
tree bends and twists in the wind are sources of pitch.
Insect attacks also stimulate pitch production.  If an
insect is involved, especially the one you probably saw,
the pitch will probably have a yellowish or pinkish
color.  If it is due to wind or growth cracks in the
bark, the pitch will first be crystal clear, drying to a
frosty white, and with age turning brownish.<p>
     Some of the pitch you saw was probably due to cracks
in the bark, but there was obviously an insect involved
as you saw one dug from the pitch.  The pine pitch moth
and the pine bark moth are the likely candidates.  They
are not true borers and cause relatively little damage to
the tree.  They injure the bark a little to stimulate
production of pitch.  They make their home inside the
pitch and feed on the pitch.  Insecticides cannot
penetrate the pitch and systemic insecticides do not
enter the pitch; therefore, spraying is not recommended.
Besides, there are not insecticides labeled for control
of these insects.  If the tree is heavily infested, there
may be other underlying problems.  An unhealthy tree is
more likely to be injured than a healthy tree.  Proper
planting and culture are the most effective means of
preventing the pitch moth or bark moth from causing major
problems.<p>

<h2>Transplanting iris</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
Is it time to transplant my irises?  How can I make
more plants without hurting the plants?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
  Yes,  August is the month to be transplanting iris
and many other spring flowering perennials.  They will be
producing new roots shortly and will establish more
readily if transplanted as new roots are forming.<p>
     When you dig them up, you can reduce them to one or
a couple of "fans" of leaves with their attached stems.
You don't have to leave the clumps large.  In fact, they
will benefit from being divided so they are not so
crowded.<p>
     When you divide them, be sure to prepare the soil
where they will be planted.  Add organic matter, well
rotted compost is preferred.  This will increase the
water-holding capacity of sandy soils and increase
drainage of heavier soils.  Use manure sparingly.
Incorporate a phosphate source into the soil.
"Incorporate" means don't just put it on the surface, but
mix it in.  According to Dr. R.D. Baker, NMSU Extension
Agronomist, in our alkaline soils bone meal is often not
a good phosphate source.  Superphosphate will do a better
job of supplying phosphorus in our soil.  Colloidal and
phosphate rock are allowed for certified organic
gardeners.<p>

<h2>Mimosa Vascular Wilt</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
My mimosa trees are beginning to die.  They were
just getting large enough to make some shade.  What is
wrong and what can I do?  The County Extension Agent
collected samples and sent them to Las Cruces for
diagnosis.<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
Dr. Natalie Goldberg, Extension Plant Pathologist,
diagnosed the problem as Mimosa Vascular Wilt disease.
According to Dr. Goldberg, Mimosa Vascular Wilt is due to
a fungus, <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>perniciosum</i>.  It is a
soil-borne fungus which invades trees through the root
system through wounds or directly into weakened trees.
Trees may be weakened by compacted soil or construction
damage.  Root injury during planting into contaminated
soil can also result in infection.<p>

     This disease has caused considerable damage to
mimosas in the southeastern U.S.  It has entered New
Mexico in contaminated soil in nursery containers.<p>

     Symptoms of this disease include chlorosis (leaf
yellowing), leaf wilt occurring in early to mid-summer,
and death of branches and the tree.<p>

     Balanced fertilizers (those with equal percentages
of nutrients) may help alleviate symptoms in infected
trees.  High nitrogen fertilizers are not recommended.
Water frequently to moderate wilt symptoms, but don't
overwater and cause root rots.  Dead branches should be
removed and burned.<p>

     Fungicides provide little benefit.  Use of resistant
trees is the best means of avoiding the problem.  Some
resistant trees to consider include redbud, honey locust,
and locust.<p>

<h2>Watering Trees in Winter</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
I planted several young trees this summer and have
tried to be diligent in watering them. My question is,
"What kind of watering schedule would generally be
appropriate for the fall and winter months?"  (The trees
in question are Sycamore, Arizona Ash, and Chinese
Pistache.)<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>

In the fall and winter when temperatures decline and
as leaves drop from deciduous trees, the rate that water
is used by the trees decreases.  We can reduce the
frequency of watering at this time.  Continue to apply
the same amount of water with each irrigation, just apply
water less often.  The frequency with which you irrigate
will depend on the age of the trees, the soil in which
they are planted, and weather conditions.   Remember that
evergreen trees have retained their leaves and will need
to be watered as well.<p>
     Young trees have less extensive root systems and
should be watered every 14 to 20 days if there has been
no soaking precipitation.  Older trees, established for
three or more years, can be watered every 20 to 30 days.
The more frequent irrigation, 14 or 20 days depending on
tree age, is required for trees growing in sandy soils
which hold less water.  Longer intervals may be allowed
for trees in heavier soils containing clay.  If the
weather has been warm and windy, additional irrigations
may be needed.  If the weather is cool and there have
been good slow, soaking, rains or snows, irrigations may
be skipped.  Check the soil to see if there is moisture
several inches down.  While you don't want the soil to
dry totally, there is little reason to apply water while
the soil is moist.  In areas where the soil freezes, it
is difficult to add moisture.  In these areas, irrigate
well before the soil freezes and when it thaws.<p>
     When irrigating trees, moisten the soil to a depth
of two to three feet with each irrigation.  This should
then provide sufficient water to keep the soil moist for
the intervals recommended above.  Remember, a clay soil
will hold more water than sand, so you must apply more
water to moisten clay to the same depth than when
watering sandy soil.  Since clay soils absorb water
slowly, you may have to irrigate very slowly or in
several brief, repeated, irrigations to provide enough
water to moisten the soil to the proper depth.  Water
applied too rapidly to clay runs off and does not
accomplish your purpose.<p>

<h2>How do I get fall color?</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
Every year I see some trees around town turning
beautiful colors in the autumn, but my trees never
develop pretty colors.  What is wrong with them?  What
can I do?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>

	This is a complicated subject.  Factors which are
involved in development of fall color include the genetic
capacity to develop the colors, proper growing conditions
and location, and the absence of leaf diseases.
Development of autumn color really means that the
chlorophyll in the leaves has degraded and the underlying
colors hidden by the green become revealed.  Yellows were
there all along, sometimes purple is present throughout
the growing season as well, and is apparent as dark green
leaves until the chlorophyll degrades.  Then the purple
remains.  Reds often develop in the autumn under the
influence of sunny days.  The sunny days allow the plants
to produce sugars.  The cool nights prevent the movement
of sugars from the leaves to other parts of the plant.
The sugars accumulate in the vacuoles, storage organs in
the cells, and are converted to anthocyanin and other
pigments.  When the green chlorophyll degrades, these
stored pigments become visible.<p>

     Genetics, or the innate ability of a plant to
develop fall color is important.  Some species of trees
don't have the ability to develop color.  Other species
have that capacity under some environmental conditions.
Within a species of trees which can develop fall color
there are individuals which lack the ability to develop
color.  If you want to purchase a tree that develops fall
color, it is often wise to purchase the plant in the
autumn when you can see its color.  Within the nursery I
have observed tremendous variation in leaf color of some
trees and shrubs.  Within a species I have seen the
colors range fom no color, green leaves until they drop,
to bright yellow, red, orange, and mixtures of yellow and
red.  Some will develop color early, others may delay
color development.<p>

     Even if the tree has the genetic ability to develop
beautiful fall colors, it may not do so if it is not
grown properly.  Irrigation or precipitation late into
the fall may delay or prevent color development.  By
irrigating the tree well through the growing season and
withholding irrigation the last month before frost, we
can encourage the tree to prepare for autumn and often to
develop color.  This also prevents the tree from being
injured by a warm fall followed by a sudden change to
very cold weather.  Fertilization late in the summer can
also prevent or reduce fall colors.  This is also a
factor which can cause injury by a sudden fall freeze as
the tree has been encouraged to remain actively growing
and has not hardened-off in preparation for fall.<p>

     Some trees such as the maples, famous for their
contributions to the Northeastern autumns, do not do well
in the West.  They will grow here, but many of them
cannot tolerate our hot, dry, windy summers.  Their
leaves are injured by our summers and often not able to
provide the colors we desire.  There are some maples
which do well here as evidenced by the Big-tooth maples
native to the Rocky Mountains.  I have even seen sugar
maples in very protected locations and sometimes,
unexplainably, in exposed locations exhibiting
spectacular fall color.  They can provide bright autumn
colors if other conditions are correct.  There are also
oaks which can give us good fall color.  The Chinese
Pistache and other trees and shrubs adapted to the soils
and environment of the Southwest are also available, so
by choosing adapted plants which have the ability to
develop fall color, you can accomplish what you wish.<p>

     So, your tree may not change color in the fall
because it is not able to, or because you have been too
nice to it, watering, fertilizing, and discouraging
preparation for autumn.  However, even when everything
else is correct, a wet monsoon season and fall can result
in leaf spot fungi which cause early leaf drop,
preventing color development.<p>

<h2>Making Christmas Cactus bloom on time</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
When should I begin treating my Christmas cactus to
make it flower in time for the holidays?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
Now.  Late September is the time to begin flower
induction in Christmas cactus, poinsettia, and other
plants which are grown for flowers during the holiday
season.<p>
     Most of these plants flower after being exposed to a
prolonged period of long nights.  This treatment may be
accomplished by placing the plants in a dark closet from
5:00 p.m. to 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. each morning.  Do not
leave the plants in the dark from now until the holidays.
They need light to continue growing, to form their flower
buds, and to remain healthy.  Another method is to keep
the plant in a room which is not entered during the
night.  As long as lights are not turned on in the room
and the window is not brightly lit by a street light,
flowering should develop properly.  If you must enter the
room or if there is bright street light, you can cover
the plant with black cloth or a black plastic garbage bag
each night.  Just remember to remove the covering in the
morning.<p>
     Some of these plants also need cooler temperatures
during this period.  Night temperatures of 55 to 60
degrees Fahrenheit are adequate to speed flower
development.  Day temperatures are less critical, just
keep them from getting too hot.  That is, don't keep the
plants in a room which will consistently be above 85 to
90 degrees.<p>
     Enjoy your home grown holiday flowers.<p>

<h2>Houseplant pest control before and after bringing
    them in for the winter</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
Now that it is getting cooler I began to bring my
houseplants back inside.  Many of them have insects on
them.  I don't want to spray insecticides inside.  What
can I do?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
It is a good idea to begin inspecting and treating
houseplants a month or more before you bring them in from
their summer outside.  Often insect infestations are
minimal in these outside plants because natural predators
and parasites keep them in check.  Once they come inside
and are away from the natural agents which have been
controlling them, their populations can explode and your
plants can look pretty bad.  Inside they can spread
through a collection of plants rapidly.<p>
     While the plants are outside, you have a greater
variety of treatment methods from which to choose.  You
can use appropriate chemical control measures, both
organic and synthetic products.  Once the plants are back
indoors, your treatment options are more limited.  There
are pest control products labeled for indoor use, but the
variety is less.  If you have a severe infestation and
cannot find an appropriate indoor use insecticide, you
may be able to take the plants outside on a warm day to
spray them.  If the forecast is for a prolonged warm
spell, which is common at this time of year, you can
leave the plants outside for several days before
returning them to their window location.<p>
     Once the weather gets colder, you may not be able to
take the plants outside and will be able to use only
methods appropriate for use inside.  Insecticidal soaps
are generally safe for both the plant and people.  They
may be applied to the plant on the windowsill.  If you do
not want to risk getting the soap spray on the window or
surrounding curtains and furnishings, you can move the
plants to the bathtub for treatment.  For plants which
may be injured by soap sprays spraying with a forceful
water spray while in the bath tub may be sufficient to
physically remove the insects from the plants.<p>
     Constant vigilance is necessary while the plants are
indoors so that you may treat problems before they become
too severe to be treated and before they spread.<p>

<h2>Can I prune roses now?</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
When can I prune my roses?  They are still blooming
but have become large and in the way.<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
For now when you cut roses to use indoors, cut them
with long stems.  You can cut them down to where they
originate at the previous stem if you wish.  You can also
cut any stems that are in the way of walkways or
otherwise creating a problem.  As the roses go dormant
and flowering ceases, you can cut extremely long canes of
hybrid tea, grandiflora, and floribunda roses back to
prevent them from whipping around in the wind and
damaging the plant, but save the major pruning for the
spring.<p>
     Most of our common garden roses, except natives and
old fashioned roses, do not go dormant.  Cool weather
stops their growth and flowering, but in warm autumns
they will continue to grow and flower as long as the
temperatures allow them to grow.  In warmer climates,
roses may continue blooming into December or longer.
Because of their lack of dormancy and the fact that
pruning can stimulate growth, caution is advised with
regard to pruning dates.  If a period of warm weather
follows pruning in the autumn, the rose may resume growth
only to be severely damaged by cold weather that follows.
Pruning two weeks to a month before the expected last
killing frost in the spring helps avoid this problem.<p>
     For climber and rambler roses, the same holds true
with regard to problematic stems, but they should be
pruned much less.  Their flowering habits are different,
often producing their best bloom display on the older
canes.  So for them, don't over prune at any time.  If
their size continues to cause a problem, you might
consider whether or not they are planted in the wrong
location.<p>

<h2>Can I prune grapes now?</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
When can I prune my grape vines?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
Like roses, grapes are best pruned in the spring
just a little before the expected last frost.  Like
roses, they can be stimulated to grow by pruning and warm
weather.  Properly maintained grapes are pruned quite
severely and the loss of the new growth following proper
pruning can be disastrous for the plant.  Some growers
practice what they call green pruning - pruning after
leaves have appeared on the vines.  This is less
debilitating to the plant than having the new growth from
the desired buds killed by a late frost.  The green
growth cut by late pruning is often damaged by late
freezes anyway.<p>
     More information on growing and pruning grapes is
available at your local County Extension Office.<p>

<h2>Can I plant trees now?</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
Is it too late to plant trees and shrubs?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
No.  Autumn is an excellent time to plant many trees
and shrubs.  There are a few exceptions such as desert
willow, but for others plant now.  It is important to
properly care for trees and shrubs planted now.  Prepare
the soil by loosening the soil over a large area, adding
compost or peatmoss to this prepared site.  At the center
of this area of loosened soil, dig a hole no deeper than
needed to plant the tree or shrub, remove it from the
nursery can, cut or spread any circling roots.  If it is
balled and burlapped, remove any wire basket after
setting the plant into the hole, roll the burlap to the
bottom of the hole, and cut any twine tied around the
base of the tree.  Backfill the planting hole with soil.
Don't add additional compost, peatmoss, or manure to this
backfill soil.  Water the tree well, and continue
watering at weekly or twice monthly intervals through the
winter.  The tree has a limited root system and will
loose water through its bark and twigs during the winter.
You must replace the water that is lost.  This is
especially true when the winter weather provides periods
of warm and windy conditions.<p>
     Trees such as desert willow are exceptions to fall
planting recommendations because they prefer to be dry in
the winter.  A watering schedule such as that describe
above often kills the tree.  Other trees, however,
produce considerable root growth in the autumn and are
better anchored in the spring when the winds begin.
Planting in the fall often prevents the need for staking
newly planted trees.<p>

<h2>Garden catalog sources</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
My friends have garden catalogs that I have never seen before.
Where can I find out how to get some different garden catalogs?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
There are several ways to receive some different and very
interesting catalogs.  The first is to subscribe to a garden
magazine.  Unless you instruct the publisher otherwise, they will
"share" your name with their advertisers.  You will begin receiving
catalogs from a variety of nurseries and gardening supply
companies.  You may even receive catalogs from companies
specializing in outdoor clothing.<p>
     Another way is to send a card to advertisers in the magazines.
You can subscribe to the magazines, buy them at the magazine racks
in book stores or grocery stores, or just go to your local library
and read the garden magazines there.  There will be numerous
advertisements in the magazine, some of them for specialized types
of nurseries.  Some require that you send money for their catalog;
others are free.  Those that require money often provide a
certificate good for at least that amount on your first purchase.
Once you purchase from a nursery, you will be on their mailing list
for a long time.<p>
     Finally, if your friends have a catalog that is of interest to
you, just copy the address from their catalog and send a postcard
to the nursery requesting their catalog.<p>
     This is a good time of year to be requesting a catalog.  Many
of them are being printed now for delivery during the holiday
season.  You will receive them in plenty of time to place an order
before planting time.<p>
     Don't forget to check with your local nursery or garden
center.  If you do not have a nursery nearby, as you travel across
New Mexico, check into the nurseries in the towns you visit.  You
will find many interesting plants, seeds, and gardening accessories
right here in New Mexico.  If you don't find what you are looking
for, ask the nursery if they can get it for you.<p>

<h2>Add manure now</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
Is it ok to add manure to my garden soil now?  I heard that it
is best to use it in the fall.<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
Now is the proper time.  Once the crops have been harvested
and you are ready to clean your garden for the winter, you can
apply manure to the garden.  Winter precipitation will help leach
the various salts present in manure below the root zone of next
year's crops, if there is winter precipitation.  It is possible to
apply manure in the spring, but waiting until spring to apply
manure to the garden increases the chances that your seedlings and
transplants will be injured.  If you want to apply manure in the
spring, the wisest thing to do is to compost it with chipped tree
trimmings and lawn waste over the winter, then apply the compost to
the garden in the spring.<p>

<h2>Rototil old leaves into the garden</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
Is it OK to rototil fallen leaves and old vegetable plants
into the garden rather than building a compost pile?  I've done
it before, but some years the leaves and old plant stems are
still there in the spring.<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
In general, yes.  However, there are some warnings.  In
particular, if any of your garden plants had fungal or bacterial
diseases, remove them from the garden.  Turning them into the
soil almost guarantees disease problems next year.  Most
gardeners will remove and dispose of diseased garden plants. That
is the safest way to deal with them. Tree diseases are not
usually a problem for the garden plants, so the leaves from the
trees should not be a problem.<p>
     Even if you remove diseased plants from the garden, be sure
to rotate your crops the next year.  This is good advice even if
you didn't have diseased plants.  Crop rotation helps prevent the
build-up of disease organisms in the soil. Crop rotation means
that you move the crop you grew in one spot to another place the
next year.<p>
     The reason that the material turned into the garden doesn't
decompose over the winter is probably due to the fact that the
soil was too dry that winter, or the plant debris was too woody.
In the spring when you rototil the garden, rake out any
uncomposted material and finish composting in a compost pile, or
use it as mulch between the rows in the garden.  Adding manure as
you turn the debris under in the fall and making sure the soil is
moistened in dry winters will maximize the in-situ composting.<p>

<h2>African violet leaf cuttings</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
A friend gave me a leaf from one of her beautiful African
violets and told me how to grow new plants from it.  Is this a
good time?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
Yes, leaf-petiole cuttings from African violets can be
started almost anytime.  It is important to keep them in a well-
lighted room but not in direct sunlight.  The room should be
comfortably warm.  If it is warm enough for you to be
comfortable, the cutting should root readily.<p>
     For those who don't know how to start an African violet from
a leaf-petiole cutting, it is very easy.  The simplest method is
to  place the petiole (stem) portion into a small glass of water
with the leaf blade remaining in the air.  In a few weeks roots
will have developed and a few weeks after that small plantlets
will appear at the end of the petiole.  Leaves will form
underwater and when the plantlets have several leaves about one-
fourth-inch across or more, the little plants may be separated
and placed in pots in good African violet potting soil.  It would
be wise to place plastic bags over these pots for a while so that
our dry air doesn't kill them before they can develop strong root
systems in the pots.  Gradually punch holes in the bag after a
couple of weeks, each week adding more holes until the plants are
adapted to the drier air.  Of course, while the pots are in the
plastic bags, keep them in a brightly lit location, but don't
allow them to be in direct sunlight or the heat will kill your
little plants.<p>
     For those who want a simpler way to start the plants, just
place the petiole of the leaf into moist potting soil in a pot.
Keep the potting soil moist and perhaps start with the pot and
leaf in a plastic bag.  As the little plants develop, begin
punching holes in the bag as described above.  In a few months
you will have a nice new African violet.<p>
     Before you start a new plant, be sure to check the label
that came with the plant to see if it is patented.  If it is
patented, it is illegal to start new plants until the patent
expires.<p>

<h2>Lots of brown pine needles</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
Why are there so many brown needles on my ponderosa pine
trees?  There are still green needles, but there is also a lot of
brown.  I thought they were evergreens.   Are they dying?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
While browning needles in a pine can indicate problems,
brown needles are also a natural occurrence.  Yes, pines are
evergreens.  That means there are some green needles throughout
the year, but the trees do not keep their needles forever.  Most
ponderosa pines will dispose of needles which are 3 or 4 years
old.  This can happen in the fall or the spring.  These needles
are shaded by the outer, newer, needles and do not receive enough
light to photosynthize and produce food for the tree.  Pine trees
shaded by other trees will also exhibit needle thinning.<p>
     Some years there appears to be more brown needles than other
years.  This is due to the fact that if needles from a good
growing year are being dropped, there are many needles to drop.
So, if the weather allowed good growth 4 years ago, then this
year we can expect a lot of brown needles.<p>
     This year was dry in the winter and early summer.  This
resulted in drying of the new needles.  Winter drought causes the
needles from the previous year to brown back from the tip.  A dry
spring can cause tip browning on the new needles.  Generally, the
base of most of the needles remain green, only the needle tip
turns brown.  Proper irrigation can reduce this effect.  In dry
winters, remember to water at least once a month.  In dry
springs, water well two to three times a month.  This irrigation
water should be applied beyond the drip line (the end of the
branches) over an area which extends outward a distance equal to
the height of the tree if possible.  Newly planted trees don't
have as extensive a root system and can be watered at the base of
the tree for the first two to three years, then the water
placement should be moved outward.<p>
     If all the needles at the tip of a new branch turn brown,
then a problem is indicated.  You might have a pine tip moth
infestation.  In this case, the twig will be hollowed out by the
insect.  You can break the tip of the twig to check this.  If you
aren't sure contact your local county agent for assistance.  If
pine tip moth is the problem, taking a sample of the affected
branch to the County Extension Office will allow them to diagnose
the problem.  However, a branch off a tree will not always be
sufficient if the culprit is not present in that branch.  Some
problems originate below the location at which you observe the
problem.  Pine bark beetle can cause browning of the needles as
it attacks the trunk of the tree, but in the case of the bark
beetle, all the needles will die suddenly.<p>
     Your problem is probably just the natural dropping of
needles if there are green needles at the ends of the branches.
This year you will probably find that many of these needles have
turned brown at the tip of the needle.  Don't worry unless
needles at the tip of the branch or all the needles on the tree
turn brown.<p>

A coldframe, especially in New Mexico, must be ventilated on
sunny days.  Even when the temperature is below freezing outside,
the temperature inside a cold frame can climb quite high once the
sun hits it.  Place a thermometer inside the coldframe and open
the lid when the temperature climbs to 70 degrees or so.  If it
is freezing outside, be careful not to open the lid too much.  If
it is cloudy, windy, or a cold front is expected, be careful to
monitor the temperature after ventilating the coldframe.<p>
     Some gardeners place plastic jugs filled with water in the
coldframe between the plants.  These water-filled jugs will
absorb heat and slow the rate of temperature increase in the cold
frame.  At night or when a cold front passes, they will release
the heat, protecting the plants.  Painting the jugs black will
increase their ability to absorb the heat in sunlight.<p>
     It is also possible to buy automatic coldframe/greenhouse
vents.  Some of these operate by expanding a gas in a cylinder as
they warm and require no electricity.  As the cool, the gas
contracts and closes the vent.  You might want to consider these
as well, but watch them closely to be sure they don't
malfunction.<p>

<h2>Using fallen leaves</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
I have a lot of leaves which have fallen in my lawn.  I have
a leaf blower/vacuum that sucks up the leaves and grinds them
into a mulch.  What can I do with the mulch?  Is it a good idea
to sprinkle them over the soil beds that contain flowers and
shrubs?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
Fallen leaves, shredded or intact, are a valuable resource.
These leaves can be used as a mulch to protect perennials through
the winter.  In  regions with more moisture just be sure that you
don't encourage fungi to attack your perennials.  You can protect
your plants by adding the leaf mulch after the ground has frozen
or at least after the temperatures are cool.  The mulch then
keeps the soil at a more even temperature which is desirable for
most plants.  In dry climates, the mulch will also help hold
moisture in the soil.  Many of our perennials are active below
ground even when they are dormant above the surface.  Moisture is
necessary for root development and the activities which occur
result in flower development inside bulbs.  If the leaf mulch
holds too much water, you may find it wise to remove the mulch in
the spring just as growth begins to avoid disease problems.
Experience will tell you if this is really necessary for the
plants you are growing.<p>
Alternate freezing and thawing is reduced by a thick mulch layer.
This reduces the "frost heaving" of bulbs, perennials, and newly
planted shrubs from the soil.  Remember that the mulch will keep
the soil cooler longer into the spring and delay growth and
flowering.  This may be desirable or undesirable.<p>
        The leaves will slowly decompose through the winter,
releasing nutrients into the soil to be used by your garden
plants in the spring.  When you remove the mulch in the spring or
if you do not use the leaf mulch, composting the leaves would be
a wise decision.  By composting the leaves, you can generate your
own soil amendment to improve your soil by increasing its
nutrient and water holding capacity and return some nutrients to
the soil.  The shredding by your leaf vacuum will speed the
composting process whether on-site as a mulch or in a compost
pile.<p>

<h2><i>Ficus benjamina</i> sap making mess on carpet</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
I have a <i>Ficus benjamina</i> in a well-lighted indoor location.
There is very little leaf drop, but the tree has a great deal of
sap running off the leaves onto the carpet.  Can you tell me the
cause and how to avoid it?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
The cause that comes to mind is an infestation by scale
insects.  Remember, I haven't seen your plant, so this is a guess
based on the information you provided.  While aphids can produce
honeydew (the clear, syrupy, sap-like substance you are
describing), <i>Ficus</i> are more likely to be infested with scale
insects.  These will appear as brown bumps on the twigs and
leaves which can be scraped off with a fingernail.<p>
     Scale insects are difficult to control, especially if they
have spread to other plants in your collection.  However, there
are pesticides which can be used to treat scale insects.  You
should be sure to select one which is made for use on houseplants
in the house.  Insecticidal oils and soaps may be your best
option while the plants must be kept indoors.  You will have to
treat frequently, but you should at least be able to minimize the
damage until the weather warms in the spring. Then you can take
the plants out into a shady place for a few days while you treat
with products which you can't use indoors.<p>
     If you don't find scale insects, take a sample of twigs with
leaves to your local county Cooperative Extension Service office
to diagnose your specific problem and recommend the appropriate
treatment.<p>

<h2>Dendrobium orchid keike (baby plant)</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
I have a dendrobium orchid plant growing in the window
planter of our solar home in Taos.  It has shown extraordinary
growth during the last month and has two new branches.  At the
base of the new branches there are what appear to be multiple
root shoots.  I believe these are called keikis.  Can these be
separated, planted, and produce new plants?  If so, what is the
proper method for doing this?<p>
     I believe there must be an orchid society in New Mexico, but
I have not been able to locate them.  Please help me contact
them.<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
There are many kinds of dendrobium orchids, but many of them
do frequently produce keikis.  Keiki is the Hawaiian word meaning
baby, thus these are baby plants produced on an aerial portion of
a dendrobium cane.  If the roots are being produced at the base
of the plant near the region where the canes all come together,
then it is a new shoot, not a keike.  However, if the roots are
being produced from a small growth produced from a bud on the
upper portion of the cane, it is a keiki which may be removed and
potted to grow a new plant.<p>
     The keiki can be removed from the cane with its roots
attached and potted in a seedling grade of orchid potting medium.
Epiphytic orchids such as most dendrobiums should be potted in a
well-drained potting material such as fir bark, not soil or
peatmoss.  There are several new potting mixes being used by
orchid growers, but be sure to get one that does not retain too
much water. The best time to remove the keiki is when root growth
is just beginning, before the roots get so long that they will be
injured during repotting.  Allow the potting medium to dry well
between irrigations.  Too much moisture around the roots will
cause the roots to rot.  Keep the plant in a location with high
humidity.  I use an old aquarium converted into a terrarium
placed in a south-facing window with sheer curtains to reduce the
light intensity.  You can also use fluorescent lamps suspended
four to six inches above the top of the little plant.  A minimum
of two 40-watt lamps is needed; four lamps would do a better job.<p>
     The American Orchid Society 1996-1997 Almanac lists two
orchid societies in New Mexico - one in Albuquerque, the other in
Los Alamos.  The New Mexico Orchid Society meets in Albuquerque
while the Escalante Orchid Society alternates meeting between
Santa Fe and Los Alamos.  Contact your local County Extension
Office for details.  In Albuquerque, you can also contact the
Albuquerque Council of Garden Clubs at 296-6020 for information.
Join one of these orchid societies to learn more about the
specifics of growing orchids in New Mexico and to develop
contacts with people who have had experience facing the problems
you will also encounter.  If you are interested in joining the
American Orchid Society, members of the local society can help.
You may also want to check your local library for the American
Orchid Society publication "Orchids."<p>

<h2>Sick Chinese Pistache</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
I have three Chinese pistache trees about 15 feet from each
other.  The leaves on the first one turned completely brown
before we had any frost. Its limbs are still green, but they
don't look as healthy as the limbs on the other two trees.  The
leaves on the second tree are beginning to turn brown like the
those on the first tree did.  The browning begins from the middle
of the leaf cluster where the stem comes into the cluster.  The
leaves on the third tree have only slight browning on the inside
of the leaf cluster.  The trees all receive the same amount of
water, not excessive.  They are only between 10 to 15 feet in
height and receive full sun.  These symptoms have developed in
the past month or so.  By the way, something has also killed two
of fifteen small shrubs.  Can you help me or direct me to someone
who can?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
You have given me several clues which may be very useful.  I
can't be absolutely sure, but I am inclined to think that an
herbicide has been applied to an area within about 50 feet of the
trees.  The most likely candidate would be one of the long
persistence herbicides often called soil sterilants.  These are
often used in gravel driveways, cracks and crevices of driveways
and sidewalks, and along fences and property lines.  These
chemicals may remain active in the soil for long periods of time
until the tree roots grow into the area of treated soil.  The
roots then absorb the chemical and translocate it back to the
tree.<p>
     The symptoms that make me consider herbicides as a cause are
the progressive nature of the symptoms and the fact that the
symptoms begin at the base of the leaflets.  Salt damage, early
frost damage, and wind desiccation usually affect the edge of the
leaf, with symptoms moving from the edge to the base of the
leaflet.  These herbicide symptoms often develop first on one
side of the tree and progress to the whole tree.  However, if the
herbicide was applied in locations on all sides of the tree, then
the damage could show all around the tree.<p>
     Disease may also be a cause.  To determine if a disease is a
problem, call your local county Extension Service office and find
out what kind of sample would be needed to determine the problem.
They may already be familiar with the symptoms and advise you of
the problem.  Otherwise, with a proper sample sent to the
Extension Service plant pathologist, causal diseases may be
determined.  Local nurseries are also a source of information,
especially if they will send the sample to a plant pathologist
for diagnosis.<p>
     The shrubs may have been affected by the same problem, or
they may have a separate problem.  Again, your local county
Extension Service office or local nursery should be able to help
you.<p>
     When applying herbicides, remember that tree and shrub roots
do grow to extend a great distance beyond the ends of the
branches and that they are nearer the surface than most people
realize.<p>

<h2>Drying gourds</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
How can I dry gourds without having them rot?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
The first consideration is good air circulation.  Place them
in a place with good air circulation all around them.  This air
should be dry, but here in New Mexico that is the easy part.<p>
     Don't let the gourds touch each other while they are drying.
This helps the air circulation and to prevent the spread of rot
if some do begin to rot.  The surface on which they rest should
not hold moisture.  A wire mesh surface would be the best, but a
table top is also adequate.  Turning them periodically helps them
to dry and allows you to detect rot early and dispose of affected
gourds.<p>
     Now the hard part.  It can take six or more months for them
to dry properly.  Some people will drill pinholes at the ends of
the fruit to speed the drying process, but even so, it takes many
months.  Be patient.<p>
     Be sure the gourds are mature before harvest.  Leave them on
the vines as long as possible to mature.  Gourds harvested before
they are sufficiently mature will be much more likely to rot
before drying.<p>

<h2>Plant flowering plants after blooming in winter</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
I recently received some beautiful chrysanthemums as potted
plants in flower.  I'm afraid that it will be too cold to plant
them outside when they finish blooming, but I'm not good at
growing houseplants.  What can I do to keep these alive until it
is safe to plant them outside?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
Once the flowers fade, you can move the plants to a cool but
well-lighted location until spring.  Remove any foil or other
decorative covering from the pot at this time so that it will not
interfere with proper drainage when you water your plant.<p>
     You should be sure to keep your plants watered, but don't
overwater them.  When the potting soil dries to a depth of two to
three inches, water them well so that water runs out the hole in
the bottom of the pot.  Don't let the plants absorb this water
that comes from the bottom of the pot as it contains salts washed
from the soil in the pot.  To allow it to absorb into the soil
increases salt problems.  If the soil has dried around the edges
and pulled away from the edge of the pot, you may need to water
the plant by soaking the pot in a dishpan filled with fresh water
within about one to two inches of the top of the flower pot.  In
this case, it is OK to allow the water to be absorbed from the
bottom because after it has soaked up the water, you should then
take the pot from the dishpan and allow excess water to drain
into the sink, again washing out excess salts and preventing salt
problems.  By keeping the plant in a cool, brightly lighted
location, you can keep the plants alive until the worst of the
winter is past and you can plant it outdoors.  If there is no new
growth, it can be planted while the freezing temperatures are
expected at night.  If new growth is present, wait until frost is
past to plant outside.<p>
     With all of the above stated, you can probably plant your
chrysanthemum outside as soon as it finishes blooming.  Again, be
sure that it has not begun growing and gradually acclimate it to
the outside conditions.  To do this, keep it in your coolest
room, putting it outside in a shady place on days when the
temperature is above freezing.  After a week or two, if it is in
a protected place, it can be allowed to remain outside even if
the night temperatures drop a little below freezing.  Then if the
ground isn't frozen, you can plant it in the garden where you
will grow it outdoors.  Be sure to keep it watered during the
acclimation period and after planting it in the garden.  You may
find it useful to cover it with some juniper or pine branches to
serve as a light mulch. This will protect it from the intense
direct sunlight and reduce the variation between day and night
temperatures.  This will also prevent desiccation by winter
winds.  A well-established plant may not need such protection,
but a newly planted chrysanthemum will benefit from a little
extra protection.<p>

<h2>Weeping Benjamin's fig problems</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
My weeping Benjamin's fig tree keeps dropping leaves.  It
develops new growth, but then the leaves soon fall.  I do not
have the scale insects you described in an earlier article.  What
can I do?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
If you have moved your plant to a location with too little
light or where it receives fewer hours of light, leaves will fall
as new leaves form.  Indoor light levels change with the changes
in season, so we often see this problem in the fall and spring.
If the tree is too close to a heat register, the drying caused by
this heated air can cause leaf drop.  If the plant has been in
the same pot too long and salt has accumulated, the plant will
drop leaves.<p>
     If the problems is too little light, give it a location with
more light.  If it is in a draft from the heat register, move it
to a place where it is farther from the register or use a
deflector to direct the air from the register away from the
plant.  Grow other plants in the area so that they may
collectively increase the humidity in the area.<p>
     If soil salt build-up or a root-bound condition exists
because the plant has been grown a long time in the same pot, re-
pot in new potting soil.  A slightly larger pot may also help.
If you need to keep it in the same pot, cut the circling roots at
the edge of the root ball, and trim the branches back somewhat to
reduce the size of the tree and allow it to continue to grow in

<h2>Don't Top Trees</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
You have said it is not good to top trees.  However, I still
see tree care companies topping trees.  If it is bad for trees,
why do they still top trees?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>

It is impossible to explain someone else's motives, but I
have spoken to a few of them and can relay what they say even
though I sometimes disagree.<p>

     Some say they top trees because their client wants them to
top their trees.  The client has a tree which has become too
large and wants a smaller tree.  It is easier and more profitable
to do what the client wants rather than argue or try to educate
them that topping is incorrect.  There are some tree care
professionals who will refuse to top the trees and suggest that
you hire someone else.  The problem with this argument is that
the tree which is too large was the wrong tree for that location
in the first place.  I feel the correct solution to the problem
is to "underplant" with another tree which will be appropriately
sized for the site.  As the new tree develops, the old tree can
be removed.  By underplanting and leaving the old tree for a
while, the benefits of the trees is not lost.<p>

     Some people top trees in the mistaken belief that topping
"rejuvenates" the tree.  If the tree was healthy at the time of
the topping, it responds with vigorous growth attempting to
repair the loss of a major portion of its leaf-bearing structure.
This growth occurs at the expense of the root system and uses the
stored nutrients which are necessary for surviving difficult
years (which are common in New Mexico).  The growth following
topping is weakly attached to the old branches and subject to
breakage in wind and snow as the branches get larger.  Those
branches developed following topping can become hazards in the
years following topping.  And finally, if the tree was healthy
when it was topped, it is no longer healthy following topping.<p>

     It is unfortunate that trees are so capable of surviving our
damage.  They just aren't able to repair the damage, just survive
it.  They can never become as strong or healthy again as they
would have been.<p>

     Topping allows diseases and insects to bypass the trees'
natural protective mechanisms and invade the wood of the trunk
and major branches.  Rotting of these areas follow, further
depleting the stored food reserves in the tree and reducing
structural strength.  Besides the branches being weakly attached,
this rot weakens the branches, trunk, and root system.  The tree
becomes much more likely to fall over in a storm, damaging homes,
cars, and people.  If you take a branch from a tree which was
topped several years ago and split the branch from the point of
topping downward, you can easily see the disease in that branch.
It appears as darkened wood stained by the fungi and oxidation of
compounds in the wood that were not intended to be exposed to
that much oxygen.<p>

     There are other reasons, some better than others.  The worst
reason is people top trees because they can.  A chain saw, a
ladder, and a lot of luck (that they don't hurt themselves) is
all it takes to top a tree.  It is cheap (not inexpensive),
quick, and doesn't require any knowledge of proper pruning
techniques.  Proper pruning requires knowledge and skill.<p>

     If you or your tree care professional would like to learn
more about proper tree pruning and tree care, you are invited to
attend the annual "Think Trees Conference" which will be held in
Albuquerque in January.  National, regional, and local tree care
experts will be present to teach proper tree care techniques.
This conference is spnsored by the Cooperative Extension
Service, the International Society of Arborists, the City of
Albuquerque, New Mexico State Forestry, New Mexico Association of
Nurserymen, and private tree care professionals and homeowners to
improve the care of trees in New Mexico because we value our
trees.  For more information about the Think Trees Conference and
registration fees and forms, contact your local New Mexico County
Extension Office.<p>

<h2>Change hydrangea "flower" color</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
My family gave me a potted hydrangea plant a couple of years
ago.  When I got it, it had beautiful blue flowers.  Now the
flowers are an ugly purple color.  Why did it change?  Can I do
something to make the flowers blue again?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
The "flowers" on your hydrangea are really modified leaves
called bracts, just like the so-called flowers of poinsettias.
However, the hydrangea bract color can be modified by the pH of
the soil in which the plant is grown.  Hydrangeas growing in acid
soil will have blue flowers.  Those grown in alkaline soil will
have pink flowers.  Most greenhouse potting soils contain high
levels of peat moss which tend to be acid, so hydrangeas grown in
them are blue.  In New Mexico water tends to have high levels of
dissolved minerals and an alkaline pH.  As you have watered you
hydrangea, you have been changing the pH of the potting soil and
thus the color of the bracts.<p>

To get your blue bracts back on your hydrangea, you need to
adjust the soil pH downward (make it more acid).  It would
probably be best to repot the plant after removing some of the
old soil.  Use an acidifying fertilizer and soil acidifier when
watering it.  If you are able to adequately acidify the soil,
you may choose to raise the pH by adding lime to the potting
soil.  This will cause the bracts to be pink.  Don't overdo it.
The purple color you described is the result of a neutral pH in
between acid and alkaline.<p>

<h2>Starting tomatoes indoors -- When?</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
When can I start my tomatoes inside so that they will be
ready to plant outside in the spring?  I want to have tomatoes
really early next year.<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
The usual answer to that question is to start them six to
eight weeks before you plan to plant them outside.  If your
expected planting date is late March, plant them from the first
week of February through about the middle of the month.<p>

If you have a bright location, a greenhouse, or a coldframe
in which to grow the seedlings before transplanting and can let
them get fairly large, you can start considerably earlier.  If
you plan to use covering or some other method to protect against
late frosts in the spring, you can also start earlier.  If you
live in a colder part of the state, plant them later.  If you
live in a warmer area, start earlier.<p>

<h2>When to Transplant Maximilian Sunflowers</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
When is the best time to transplant Maximilian sunflowers?
I have been impressed with their spectacular autumn blossoms.<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
You can transplant them in the spring before growth begins.
In your area that would be late February to early March.  You
could probably successfully transplant them now, but it would be
important to keep them adequately moist through the winter
without causing them to rot.  Waiting will make the transplant
easier and the chances of success greater.<p>
     In answering your question, I have applied a rule of thumb
that suggests transplanting late summer and fall blooming
perennials in the spring before growth begins.  The converse of
this is to transplant spring blooming perennials, such as
peonies, in the late summer and fall.<p>

<a name="2"></a><hr><p>
<h2>Winter Soil Improvement</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
What should I be doing to my soil now?  I have been
frustrated by these so-called New Mexico soils.  My vegetable
garden has just not done well and I am told that I need to
improve my soil.<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
What you should do depends on what you plan to grow.
Interestingly, beans, squash, and corn are native to the
southwest and need less soil improvement than many other
vegetables.  However, even these crops have been hybridized and
modified for use elsewhere and will benefit from some soil
amendments.  Lettuce, carrots, broccoli, and other vegetables
native to moister, cooler climates will need considerably more
amendment.<p>
     So what amendments should you use?  Organic matter, organic
matter, and organic matter.  Our soils in the Southwest are high
in many minerals but low in organic matter and nitrogen.  These
minerals and lack of organic matter can cause nutrient
availability problems and in some cases, salt problems
especially when sodium levels are high.  Even though the minerals
may be present in the soil, they are not always available to the
plants.  Altering the ph of the soil will help make these
nutrients available.  Organic matter helps acidify the soil,
altering its ph to be more beneficial to vegetables.  Sulfur and
sulfate compounds can also be helpful.<p>
     If you plan to add manure to your garden, now is the best
time to add it.  Manure contains high salt levels, and if your
soil already has salt problems or your soil is on the verge of
problems (very likely in New Mexico), manure should be used
carefully.  Applying it in the fall allows winter precipitation,
if there is any, to leach the salts deeper into the soil where it
is less likely to cause problems.  If you prefer to apply organic
matter in the spring, apply well-developed compost as it will
cause fewer salt problems.  Fresh or incompletely developed
compost, especially if it has a high manure content, can be a
problem.<p>
     The compost will liberate some nitrogen and other nutrients
as it continues to decompose in the garden but, to assure
adequate nutrition to your plants, you should have your soil
tested.  Contact your local County Extension Office for
information on how to get you soil tested.<p>

<h2>Gardeners' gifts</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
I have a friend who likes to garden.  I want to buy a gift
that this friend would like.  What kind of gift should I buy a
gardener?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
Gardeners are sometimes easy to buy things for, and
sometimes difficult.  Do you know what type of gardening the
gardener prefers?  Does your friend like to grow roses,
perennials, flowering bulbs, vegetables, or perhaps fruit?  Once
you know if a gardener specializes in a particular type of
gardening, you can begin to develop an idea.  Buying plants for
an experienced gardener can be difficult.  The person may have
everything needed from local and common sources, but there may be
books or tools a gardener would like to own.  If the gardener is
just beginning, then plants may be a good choice, but books and
tools are still good ideas.  Talk to the gardener and ask to see
the person's library and tool collection.  Then, slyly, ask what
tools the gardener is planning to buy in the future.  Or, talk to
your friend's spouse about any ideas for your purchase.<p>
     Books are an excellent choice.  If the gardener is really
interested in the correct names for plants and the science of
plants, there are good books in a range of prices to consider.
There are also books with beautiful photos that the gardener can
peruse as they dream of their future garden.  These books can
also be used to encourage and teach new gardeners.  Most
gardeners like to share their hobby and grow new gardeners.<p>
     There are numerous tools for gardeners - the basic ones that
most gardeners already have and then specialized tools that they
plan to purchase.  There are some to make weeding easier, such as
special hoes that fit into tight spaces, and other hoes that
minimize soil disturbance while cutting the roots of weeds.  Some
tools facilitate edging flower borders and gardens.  Other tools
make planting the garden easier.  See if there are some of these
that would be an appropriate addition to your friend's tool
collection.<p>
     Other things to consider are Walls-o-Water(TM), hot-caps,
and other things to let them start a garden earlier in the
spring.  Perhaps your friend would like to start vegetables and
flowers indoors early.  There are special seed starting kits and
pots that a gardener may enjoy.  Potting soil may also be useful.
Your friend may enjoy some new flower pots or colorful
jardinieres.<p>
     If your friend likes house plants or herbs, these would be
good gifts.  Some gardeners specialize in cacti, orchids,
tropical houseplants, or any of many other types.  Local
nurseries can also help you select such a gift.<p>
     Gardeners are a varied lot, but there are many gifts that
they would enjoy.  Be sure to give your friend a chance to tell
you about garden preferences.  Just giving of your time and
listening is a gift that almost any gardener would love.<p>
     May you shopping be pleasant and your holidays be safe and
joyous.<p>

<h2>Amaryllis</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
What can I do to make my amaryllis bloom?  It doesn't die,
but it hasn't bloomed for several years.<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
The amaryllis needs good growth followed by a rest period
before it will flower.  If it is grown indoors with insufficient
light during the summer, it cannot develop flowers.  If it needs
repotting and the soil is deficient in nutrients, especially
phosphorus, it won't bloom.  If it is kept in a growing mode and
not allowed to rest, it won't bloom.<p>
     So, give it plenty of light during the growing season, May
through August.  It doesn't need full sunlight, especially here
in New Mexico, but a bright shade with dappled sunlight is
beneficial.  It is too dark under some trees; if grass doesn't
grow well under a tree, there is probably too little light for
the amaryllis.<p>
     The amaryllis needs very well-drained soil, but this soil
should not be allowed to dry completely between waterings during
the growing season.  Check the hole at the bottom of the pot and
be sure it is not bone dry before watering.  However, don't water
so often that the soil stays soggy.  A potting soil containing a
lot of sand, perlite, or other aeration material will help keep
the soil from becoming too soggy.<p>
     Every few years the amaryllis should be repotted.  Don't use
a pot that is much larger than the bulb.  One-half to one inch
between the bulb and the edge of the pot is sufficient.  The
calcium in most of our New Mexico water accumulates in the
potting soil and interferes with the uptake of phosphorus and
other nutrients that the amaryllis needs.  Repotting and
carefully changing the soil while minimizing the damage to roots
will help.  Repotting should be done during the dormant season,
the autumn.<p>
     During the growing season, fertilize every second or third
watering with a "flowering houseplant" type of fertilizer.  This
type of fertilizer has higher levels of phosphorus which
encourages good flower development.  Don't apply the fertilizer
any stronger than the label recommends.<p>
     In early September, reduce watering and allow the foliage to
die back.  This begins the rest period during which the flowers
are formed.  Don't fertilize again until leaves appear in the
spring.  While the pots should not be allowed to become bone-dry,
less water is needed and overwatering should definitely be
avoided.  Cool temperatures in the fall, 55 to 60 degrees, helps
the amaryllis develop its flowers.  Do not let the pots freeze.
Without any extra effort on your part, the flower stalk will
appear when the bulb is ready.  At this time, increase the
watering slightly.  If you wish to speed the development of the
flowers, you can raise the temperature slightly.<p>
     Leaves will have developed by the time the flower stalk is
matured and the flowers have opened.  When the leaves begin
growing, gradually increase to watering levels you use during the
growing season.  After flowering, remove the flower stalk and
begin fertilizing.<p>
     Enjoy the flowers.<p>

<h2>Prevent short flower stalks on spring bulbs</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
Last year my daffodils and tulips bloomed with very short
stems.  Is something wrong with them?  Do I need to transplant
them?  Is it too late to move them now?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
It is too late to move them for most New Mexicans, but that
is not what they need.  Even though you can't see leaves or
flowers now, they are very busy underground.  They produced roots
this past fall and now they are beginning the process which
results in the leaves and flowers appearing above the soil in
just a couple of months, or sooner.<p>
     What they need now is water.  There must be moisture in the
soil for good flower stalk development to occur.  At this time of
year, water doesn't evaporate as rapidly as in the summer, so you
don't need to water as often as in the summer, but in our dry
Southwestern climate they usually need supplemental water.<p>
     Check the soil to see if it is moist where your flowering
bulbs are planted.  If the soil is moist an inch or so down, then
don't worry.  If it is dry, water to moisten the soil to a depth
of at least a foot.  That should be enough water for a month or
so.  Just check the soil moisture occasionally and water when
needed.  As the days become warmer and the winds develop, the
soil will dry more quickly.  Check more often during warm or
windy weather and water if the soil is dry.<p>
     After the plants have flowered and the leaves naturally turn
yellow and brown, you can reduce watering again.  Summer is the
season when the bulbs need the least water, though you can't let
them dry completely even in the summer.  If your bulbs are
planted in perennial beds or with other plants, you must continue
to water during the summer for the sake of the other plants.
This will not harm the bulbs unless you keep the soil constantly
soggy.  Then the plants growing with the bulbs will also be
overwatered.<p>

<h2>Fragrant indoor plant</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
I have an atrium area that receives bright light for most of
the day.  I love the fragrance of gardenias, but can't
successfully grow them.  Is there something easier to grow that
will have the same fragrance?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
You might wish to try a plant called Hedychium.  It is also
known as white or yellow ginger.  It has a strong, pleasant
gardenia-like scent and is easy to grow if you have the room for
it.  It produces a three-to-four-foot tall plant that looks a
little like a corn plant.  When it is large enough, it produces
large white or yellow flowers at the top of the stalks.  These
flowers are very fragrant.  They are not suitable for cutting,
but they will definitely fill your atrium with perfume.<p>
     The plant grows from a rhizome which looks very much like
ginger root.  This is because it is a relative of the ginger used
as a spice.  It prefers a soil composed of peat or compost mixed
with a considerable quantity of sand so that it does not become
soggy.  It does not tolerate drying well.  If the soil dries, the
top will begin to turn yellow and die back.  The rhizomes will
survive and regrow if they don't dry for too long, but the plant
will not bloom again until it has regrown the top again.<p>
     It will bloom more prolifically if allowed to become pot-
bound, that is to fill the pot and have rhizomes pressed against
the side of the pot.  It is possible for these rhizomes to split
plastic pots as they become pot-bound.  In that situation the
plant may be repotted or divided and repotted.<p>
     Adequate light is important.  Full sunlight is not needed,
but bright dappled light is needed.  In too shady a location,
flowers will be fewer and less frequent.<p>
     You may have to search somewhat to find the plant, but it is
available through several garden catalogs.  Good luck and enjoy
the perfume.<p>

<h2>Gardening for the wheel chair gardeners</h2>

<big><b>Question:</b></big>
My husband used to be an avid gardener.  Following an
accident, he is confined to a wheel chair and seems to have lost
all enjoyment of life.  I read somewhere that gardening is an
activity which helps people recover from injuries.  Can you tell
me how a gardener can garden from a wheel chair?<p>

<big><b>Answer:</b></big>
Gardening can be very therapeutic to anyone, but to
gardeners with injuries or limitations, the benefits of gardening
are especially apparent.  I recently discussed this with a
retired surgeon.  He had heard of horticultural therapy, but
until recently following surgery he was not fully aware of the
benefits.  As is common following surgery, he suffered depression
and lethargy.  Gardening overcame these common surgical after
effects.  Anyone who has been injured can suffer depression and
frustration with limitations brought about by the injury.
Gardening can help them.<p>
     So, how can one garden from a wheel chair?  It is possible
to build raised garden beds so that the gardener can sit on the
edge or in a wheel chair beside the garden and reach into the
garden.  Working and reaching to the side can be quite tiring,
however.  A more convenient method of gardening for the chair-
bound gardener is to use a garden table.<p>
     A garden table is really just what it says.  It is a table
which consists of a box holding soil raised on legs to a level
such that a wheel chair or other chair may be rolled under the
table, allowing a gardener to sit at the table while gardening.
The gardener need only reach forward, not turning and reaching to
the side as with a raised bed garden which is to the side of the
wheel chair.  The depth of soil in the table should be at least
six inches.  It is possible to allow the bottom of the table to
slant downward away from the gardener to allow greater soil
depth, as long as it doesn't interfere with the wheel chair and
legs of the gardener.  The gardener should be able to reach from
front to back of the table garden easily, thus the "reaching
depth" of the garden table should be no greater than the distance
that the gardener can reach from the seated position.  However,
if the table garden allow wheel chair access from the other side,
the garden table can be twice as wide.<p>
     Corn and other tall free standing crops will be difficult to
grow in such a shallow garden; they will need deeper soil to hold
the plant upright.  Smaller growing plants will be easier to
grow.  Taller crops will need a deeper soil, one to three feet
deep, and will perhaps require the gardener to reach to the side
to garden, but if the size of the deep garden is limited, the
gardener can grow almost anything.<p>
     The soil for such a garden can be carefully chosen from
available potting soil or formulated by the gardener from home-
made compost, sand, perlite, native soil, and other materials.
Such a tailored soil can often be more productive than the soil
in the typical traditional garden plot.  It is also possible to
tailor the soil in various parts of the table garden or in
different table gardens to be especially well adapted to the
crops to be grown in that soil.  For winter gardening,
traditional containers (flower pots) or a specially constructed
window table garden can be employed.  Irrigation can be
accomplished by hand watering, drip irrigation, or other more
exotic methods such as Olla irrigation.  (I'll discuss that
another time.)<p>
     Intensive gardening practices can be applied to such a
garden.  It is possible to grow a very productive garden
accessible to a wheel chair.  In addition to herbs, flowers, and
vegetables, the gardener will grow a sense of satisfaction and
accomplishment.  The gardener will learn that he is less disabled
that he currently thinks.<p>

<h1>Agricultural Experiment Station (AES)<hr></h1>

The Agricultural Experiment Station is the research arm of the
<a href="../Welcome.html">College of Agriculture and Home Economics.</a>
Headquartered on the <a href="http://www.nmsu.edu">New Mexico State
University</a> (NMSU) main campus in Las Cruces, the Agricultural Experiment
Station is made up of researchers on the main campus and at <a href="AESctrrsh.html">
agricultural science centers and research centers</a> throughout the state.  (There
is a <a href="exp_map.html">clickable map</a> of the science centers and research
centers available.)  The off-campus centers support basic and applied research under
New Mexico's varied environmental conditions to meet the agricultural and natural
resource management needs of communities throughout the state.<p>

The research programs are designed to work cooperatively with
<a href="../ACP/Welcome.html">academic</a> and <a href="../CES/Welcome.html">Extension</a>
programs of the College of Agriculture and Home Economics.  The Agricultural Experiment
Station oversees research projects carried out by all departments of the College and
is a crucial element within the graduate instruction program.  Most of the scientists
of the Agricultural Experiment Station divide their time between teaching and research.
<p>

Administered by the Plant Genetics Engineering Laboratory (<strong>PGEL</strong>) in
conjunction with the NMSU Agricultural Experiment Station, The Southwest
Consortium for Plant Genetics and Water Resources, consisting of NMSU, the
University of California at Riverside, the University of Arizona, Texas Tech
University, and Los Alamos National Laboratory, funds research relevant to
arid and semi-arid adaptation.  The overall goal of the Consortium is to
bring together multidisciplinary scientific teams to develop innovative
advances in plant biotechnology and related areas in agriculture and water
management.
<p>

The Agricultural Experiment Station works cooperatively with research units
of three federal agencies: the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and Agricultural Research Service
(ARS), and the Department of Interior's National Biological Service (NBS).
The NRCS Plant Materials Release Center is located at the Agricultural
Science Center at <a href="AESctrrsh.html#lunas">Los Lunas</a> and is closely
tied to our science center operations.  On the NMSU campus, ARS and NBS scientists
enjoy faculty status in the College.
<p>

The ARS Jornada Experimental Range and the College of Agriculture and Home
Economics' <a href="AESctrrsh.html#ranch">College Ranch</a> are participants in the National Science Foundation's
<a href="http://lternet.edu/about/sites/names.htm">Long-Term Ecological
Research</a> (LTER) program.  The NBS New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife
Research Unit is conducting gap analyses with the cooperation of the Agricultural
Experiment Station and NMSU's Remote Sensing Geographic Information Laboratory.
<p>

Along with the University of Arizona, the University of Illinois, South
Dakota State University, Texas A&M-Kingsville, and the Jewish National Fund,
NMSU is a founding member of the
<a href="http://ag.arizona.edu/OALS/IALC/NM.html">International Arid Lands
Consortium</a> (IALC).  The IALC researches the use of arid and semiarid lands
to evaluate problems from increased aridity.  The IALC also helps developing
nations foster sustainable resource practices.

<STRONG>Welcome to the WEA Challenger Network! </STRONG>The Network
is a grassroots coalition of Washington state public education
employees who are taking a stand against use of our union dues
for political activity by the local, state (WEA), and national
(NEA) education associations. This newsletter is to inform you
of your legal rights, the union's documented political spending
with our dues, and other pertinent information for those who believe
that the union does not legitimately represent their beliefs.
This organization supports union expenditures on legitimate union
activities for collective bargaining, contract maintenance and
improvement of working conditions. We believe union expenditures
for political and ideological education and activity on which
a diverse membership disagrees should not be funded from mandatory
dues and agency fees but only by voluntary contributions to WEA-PAC.
<P>
<STRONG><U>The WEA Challenger Network is not anti-union. It is
pro-child, pro-education, and pro-employee</U>.</STRONG>

<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=4>
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/head9.gif"><STRONG> Compulsory WEA Membership?
What are Your Rights? </STRONG>
</H3><P>
 The United States Supreme Court has interpreted the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to
guarantee educators and other workers the right to withhold that
portion of their union dues which is not spent on collective bargaining,
grievance procedures and contract maintenance (chargeable activity.)
They also have the right to challenge the amount that the union
claims it spends on chargeable activity in order to receive what
they consider a legitimate reduction in dues based on the union's
non-chargeable activity such as political education, training,
etc.

<P>
Education employees are not required to join the union. Even in
closed shop districts, education employees do not have to join
the union. They only have to pay the &quot;agency shop fee&quot;
or &quot;fair share&quot; of chargeable activity. They are not
required to pay for non-chargeable activity. A problem arises
with the union's calculation of the &quot;fair share&quot; because
it deceptively categorizes its political expenditures so that
the &quot;fair share&quot; is dramatically inflated. In order
for agency shop fee payers to receive a legitimate reduction in
dues, they must exercise their right to challenge the amount the
union claims is the &quot;fair share.&quot; <EM>If the agency shop
fee payer does not challenge, he/she will continue to pay 100%
of union dues</EM>
<P>
The union is legally required to represent agency shop fee payers
the same as members and provide the same benefits, rights, and
services stated in the contract. It cannot discriminate based
on membership status. Agency fee payers cannot participate in
union governance (run for office or vote for WEA officers) and
they cannot receive strike benefits. The union drops agency shop
fee payers from its liability insurance, but it has not justified
how those premiums are not covered by &quot;fair share&quot; fees.
(Similar coverage is available for reasonable rates from independent
education associations.)
<P>
When inquiring about their rights, many educators have been given
inaccurate or incomplete information by union officials. To obtain
your rights, there are certain steps each member must take in
order to receive a reduction in dues for objectionable political activity.
<P>
<CENTER><STRONG><H3>The WEA Challenger Network will give you the facts!</H3></STRONG></CENTER>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=center SIZE=4>

<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/head4.gif"> If you would like information on how
Washington education employees can stop paying for the union's
political/ideological activity while retaining union representation
in collective bargaining, grievance resolution, and contract maintenance,

The Education Policy Institute is a 501 (c)(3) organization
devoted to educational research, policy analysis, and training
from a public choice and market oriented perspective.
<P>
Although EPI is newly established, its chairman and president
are nationally prominent for their contributions on educational
policy issues; EPI Chairman, Dr. Myron Lieberman, is widely recognized
as the nation's leading authority on educational employment relations
and teacher unions.
<P>
Charlene K. Haar, President of EPI, is author of groundbreaking
studies of the National PTA that have appeared in lay and professional
journals. Her publications have led to widespread scrutiny of
the PTA as an NEA/AFT dominated organization. In addition, Ms.
Haar is coauthor of <U>The NEA and AFT: Teacher Unions in Power
and Politics</U>. This book is the leading publication on the
structure and operations of the teacher unions.

<P>
JUDGES: Before NELSON and DAUGHTREY, Circuit Judges, and HILLMAN,
District Judge. (<B>footnote</B>: The Honorable Douglas W. Hillman,
United States District Judge for the Western District of Michigan,
sitting by designation).<BR>

<P>
<B>DAVID A. NELSON, Circuit Judge</B>. The plaintiffs in this
lawsuit are public employees whose wages, hours, and other conditions
of employment are established through collective bargaining between
the bodies by which they are employed and local unions affiliated
with the Michigan Education Association. The plaintiffs are not
union members. Under agency shop contracts authorized by state
law, however, the plaintiffs are required to pay agency fees,
or &quot;service fees,&quot; that are divided among local, state
and national unions involved in the bargaining process.<BR>

<P>
Alleging that the amount collected by the unions in 1991-92 exceeded
constitutional limits, part of the fees having been based on expenditures
for political, ideological, and other activities not demonstrably
germane to collective bargaining, the plaintiffs sued for declaratory,
injunctive and monetary relief under 42 U.S.C. # 1983. The stated
purpose of the action was to vindicate the plaintiffs' First Amendment
rights to freedom of speech, association, petition, belief and
thought.<BR>

<P>
The plaintiffs served timely discovery requests in which they
sought, among other things, identification of the people who had
calculated the service fees and production of documents underlying
the calculations. Discovery was stayed after the unions complied
with a portion of the document request relating to the record
of a service fee arbitration that had been conducted at the unions'
request (and in which one of the plaintiffs had participated)
pursuant to <I>Chicago Teachers Union v. Hudson</I>, 475 U.S.
292, 89 L. Ed. 2d 232, 106 S. Ct. 1066 (1986). (<I> Hudson</I>
holds that while the decision rendered by the arbitrator in such
a proceeding cannot be given preclusive effect in a subsequent
# 1983 action, a union's collection of an agency fee is permissible
if the union provides (1) an explanation of the basis of the fee,
(2) an opportunity to challenge the fee before an impartial decisionmaker,
and (3) an escrow for amounts reasonably in dispute. The plaintiffs
do not deny that the unions met these conditions here.)<BR>

<P>
After unsuccessfully seeking dismissal of the # 1983 action on
statute of limitations grounds, the unions moved for summary judgment
on the strength of the arbitrator's decision -- a decision in
which the exaction of service fees in the amounts set by the unions
was held not to violate the First Amendment. Although the arbitrator
had not seen the documents underlying the unions' calculation
of the service fees, the unions maintained that the arbitral award
was entitled to great weight in the # 1983 case even without discovery
of the underlying documents.<BR>

<P>
The stay of discovery was continued during the pendency of the
summary judgment proceedings, despite representations by the plaintiffs
that discovery was essential to their opposition to summary judgment.
The court ultimately entered summary judgment in favor of the
unions without any of the plaintiffs having been furnished access
to the documents in question. The decision is reported as <I>Bromley
v. Michigan Educ. Ass'n</I>, 843 F. Supp. 1147 (E.D. Mich. 1994).
<BR>

<P>
The central question presented on appeal is whether the court's
curtailment of discovery constituted an abuse of discretion. We
conclude that it did. Accordingly, and because we find merit in
some, but not all, of the plaintiffs' subsidiary points, we shall
vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>I</B> <BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
Filed as a class action, the # 1983 case was brought by seven
members of the faculty of Central Michigan University together
with ten public school teachers and one public school &quot;educational
support&quot; person. The defendants are the Michigan Education
Association, seven of its local affiliates, and the Association's
parent body, the National Education Association.<BR>

<P>
Each of the named plaintiffs works in a bargaining unit all of
the members of which -- whether or not they have chosen to join
a labor union -- are represented for collective bargaining purposes
by one or another of the defendant unions. See Mich. Comp. Laws
423.211, under which a representative selected by the majority
of public employees in a bargaining unit is made the exclusive
representative of all employees in the unit.<BR>

<P>
Pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws 423.210, the plaintiffs' employers
have entered into collective bargaining agreements requiring the
plaintiffs and all other non-union bargaining unit employees to
pay service fees to the bargaining representatives. Each academic
year the unions set the fees (which may not exceed the dues paid
by union members) on the basis of &quot;chargeable&quot; costs
incurred the year before. The money goes to the local, state and
national organizations in proportion to their past expenditures
on chargeable activities. <BR>

<P>
In December of 1991, pursuant to procedures established by it
in light of the <I>Hudson</I> decision, the Michigan Education
Association sent each non-union bargaining unit employee a packet
of materials relating to the collection of service fees. Included
in the packet was a statement to the effect that individuals who
objected to contributing to the financial support of ideological
causes or political activities unrelated to collective bargaining
would be required to pay reduced fees determined by the Association
on the basis of the prior school year's representation expenditures.
The packet also included an explanation of the fee calculations,
audited union financial statements, a description of a procedure
for challenging the fees, and a &quot;service fee election form.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
Some 236 non-union employees sent back service fee election forms
on which they indicated that they wished to challenge the fees.
The first named plaintiff, Robert Bromley, stated on his form
that he would pay the reduced Association-determined fees (which
totaled $ 379.20 in his case) &quot;under protest.&quot; In addition
to checking boxes signifying that he wished to challenge the state,
local and national fees pursuant to the procedure described in
the packet, Mr. Bromley, like several other named plaintiffs,
added the following statement to his form:
<P>
&quot;Paid under protest. I have instructed my attorneys to pursue
legal action challenging both the collection procedures, as applied,
and the amount of the fee itself. I do not hereby waive my rights
to challenge the amount of the fee in forums in addition to that
provided under those procedures.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Upon receipt of the forms, the Association initiated a consolidated
arbitration proceeding under rules issued by the American Arbitration
Association after <I>Hudson</I> was decided. The rules (entitled
&quot;Rules for Impartial Determination of Union Fees&quot;) provide
that the American Arbitration Association shall appoint an impartial
arbitrator at the instance of the union. <B>The union compensates
the arbitrator and pays the American Arbitration Association a
fee as well</B> <I>(*WEACN)</I>. The arbitrator is to be &quot;experienced
in employment relations,&quot; according to the rules, and is
to render a prompt decision &quot;<B>in accordance with applicable
law and the union's internal procedures . . . .</B>&quot; <I>(*WEACN)</I>.
Prospective arbitrators are subject to challenge for cause, but
the rules contain no provision for peremptory challenges.<BR>

<P>
Neither do the rules provide for pre-hearing discovery. Rule 14
does say, however, that &quot;the parties may offer such evidence
as they desire and shall produce such additional evidence as the
<B>arbitrator may deem necessary to an understanding and determination
of the dispute</B>&quot; <I>(*WEACN)</I>. Conformity to the rules
of evidence is not necessary, but the arbitrator may require that
witnesses give their testimony under oath.<BR>

<P>
The arbitrator who was appointed in this instance, a Mr. Barry
C. Brown, conducted hearings on March 18, 19 and 23, 1992. Counsel
for the unions were present, along with various union employees
and a certified public accountant engaged by the unions. Three
individual &quot;objectors and observers&quot; appeared, only
one of whom -- Thomas Reed -- was to become a named plaintiff
in the present # 1983 action. None of the three objectors was
accompanied by a lawyer, although the rules permitted representation
by counsel or others. (<B>footnote</B>: A non-profit foundation
that is providing counsel for the plaintiffs in the # 1983 case
circulated a form letter in December of 1991 advising prospective
challengers that the foundation lacked the resources to provide
attorneys and accountants in the arbitration proceeding. The letter
stated that arbitration was not likely to provide as much relief
as a court suit. Seventeen of the 18 named plaintiffs chose not
to participate in the arbitration proceeding.)
<P>
In consonance with a line of Supreme Court caselaw that includes
<I>Railway Clerks v. Allen</I>, 373 U.S. 113, 10 L. Ed. 2d 235,
83 S. Ct. 1158 (1963), <I>Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Educ</I>., 431
U.S. 209, 52 L. Ed. 2d 261, 97 S. Ct. 1782 (1977), and <I>Hudson</I>,
the Arbitration Association rules state that &quot;<B>the burden
is upon the union to justify whatever fees are being disputed</B>&quot;
<I>(*WEACN)</I>. (<B>footnote</B>: &quot;Since the unions possess
the facts and records from which the proportion of political to
total union expenditures can reasonably be calculated, basic considerations
of fairness compel that they, not the individual employees, bear
the burden of proving such proportion.&quot; Allen, 373 U.S. at
122, as quoted in <I>Abood</I>, 431 U.S. at 239-40 n.40, and <I>Hudson</I>,
475 U.S. at 306.) In the proceeding before Mr. Brown, the unions
sought to discharge their burden through a comprehensive overview
of the unions' cost structure presented by witnesses whose testimony
was accompanied by a series of summary exhibits. One of the witnesses
testified that outside auditors were given full exposure to all
documentation used in determining the fees, but none of the three
objectors asked Mr. Brown to require production of the underlying
documentation as &quot;additional evidence&quot; under Rule 14.
We do not know how Mr. Brown would have responded to such a request.
<P>
The objectors posed some questions to the union's witnesses and
&quot;made their views known to the arbitrator,&quot; as Mr. Brown
put it in his decision. Post-hearing briefs were filed by the
state and national unions, but none of the objectors filed a brief.
<BR>

<P>
Mr. Brown issued his decision approving the union's fees on April
16, 1992. The plaintiffs brought their # 1983 action the following
October.<BR>

<P>
The defendant unions promptly raised their statute of limitations
defense in a motion for judgment on the pleadings. While that
motion was pending, the plaintiffs served the defendants with
interrogatories asking for (a) identification of the people who
had participated in preparing and auditing the schedules of expenditures
on which the service fees were based, and (b) a statement of the
dollar amount of each category of expenditures. The plaintiffs
also served a document production request covering (a) the arbitration
record, (b) the election forms returned by non-members who challenged
the service fees, and (c) &quot;documents underlying, used in,
created during, or otherwise related to defendants' calculations,
and their auditors' examinations, of defendants' schedule of chargeable
and nonchargeable expenditures on which the service fees for 1991-92
were based . . . .&quot;
<P>
<B>The defendant unions gave the plaintiffs the arbitration record
and the election forms, but declined to answer the remaining discovery
requests. The unions sought a protective order blocking all other
discovery</B> <I>(*WEACN)</I>.<BR>

<P>
In a series of orders issued before and after its denial of the
motion for judgment on the pleadings, the district court declined
to allow any further discovery. When the unions moved for summary
judgment, the plaintiffs filed papers advising the court that
there had been no showing of good cause for preventing discovery
of non-privileged matters relevant to the subject matter of the
case; that determination of the constitutionality of the unions'
classification of expenses as chargeable to objecting non-members
required &quot;specific identification of the activities involved;&quot;
and that discovery of these facts -- facts solely within the possession
of the unions -- was essential for opposition to the summary judgment
motion. Pursuant to Rule 56(f), Fed. R. Civ. P., the plaintiffs
moved to stay consideration of the summary judgment motion until
completion of discovery.<BR>

<P>
The court denied the stay, commenting that the record of the arbitration
gave the plaintiffs &quot;everything they need to enable them
to respond to the defendants' motion for summary judgment.&quot;
This position was subsequently reaffirmed in the published opinion
granting summary judgment.<BR>

<P>
&quot;But for the arbitration proceedings and award,&quot; the
district court acknowledged in its published opinion, &quot;extensive
discovery would be fully justified.&quot; <I>Bromley</I>, 843
F. Supp. at 1151. Because the plaintiffs had been accorded an
opportunity to participate in the arbitration proceeding, however,
the court found that the discovery requests at issue &quot;were
unduly burdensome within the meaning of Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).&quot;
<I>Id</I>. at 1153. &quot;Had some of the issues raised by the
defendants [sic] been brought to the arbitrator's attention,&quot;
the court said in conclusion, &quot;it is not unlikely that the
arbitrator would have required the unions to provide some additional
records.&quot; <I>Id</I>. at 1157. <B>But the arbitrator not having
been asked to provide access to the underlying records, the court
was unwilling to grant the plaintiffs access to them itself </B><I>(*WEACN)</I>.

The plaintiffs have perfected a timely appeal from the final judgment
in which the district court dismissed their complaint. <BR>

&quot;<B>To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for
the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and
tyrannical</B>.&quot; Thus wrote Thomas Jefferson in a passage
quoted in I. Brant,<I> James Madison: The Nationalist</I> 354
(1948), and repeated with approval by the Supreme Court in <I>Abood</I>,
431 U.S. at 234 n.31, and <I>Hudson</I>, 475 U.S. at 305 n.15.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Jefferson's thought is now part and parcel of our First Amendment
jurisprudence </B><I>(*WEACN)</I>. For the government to threaten
men and women with the loss of their livelihoods if they fail
to remit part of their earnings to labor unions for the advancement
of social and political causes they do not wish to support is
not only sinful and tyrannical, it is a violation of the United
States Constitution. See <I>Abood</I>, 431 U.S. at 234; <I>Hudson</I>,
475 U.S. at 301-02.<BR>

<P>
To an extent, the Supreme Court has recognized, the very existence
of an agency shop trenches upon the First Amendment interests
of bargaining unit employees who oppose unions. See <I>Hudson</I>,
475 U.S. at 309 (&quot;the agency shop itself impinges on the
nonunion employees' First Amendment interests&quot;), and <I>Lehnert
v. Ferris Faculty Ass'n</I>, 500 U.S. 507, 519, 114 L. Ed. 2d
572, 111 S. Ct. 1950 (1991), where the Court spoke of &quot;the
burdening of free speech that is inherent in the allowance of
an agency or union shop.&quot; But in a <B>constitutional compromise</B>
<I>(*WEACN)</I> not atypical of the many such compromises that
have been struck since the founding of the Republic, the Supreme
Court has decided to let all bargaining unit employees be required
to bear the cost of collective bargaining activities -- thereby
denying a &quot;free ride&quot; to non-union employees who might
stand to benefit from such activities -- while not allowing &quot;compulsory
subsidization of ideological activity by employees who object
thereto . . . .&quot; <I>Abood</I>, 431 U.S. at 237.<BR>

<P>
<B>Courts must proceed case-by-case</B> <I>(*WEACN)</I> in determining
which union expenditures are chargeable to dissenting employees
and which are not. Such determinations are frequently difficult
(particularly in the case of expenditures for activities that
may not be overtly ideological but that bear only a peripheral
relation to bargaining for the members of the unit), and the guidance
provided by the Supreme Court is somewhat general in nature. See,
for example, <I>Ellis v. Railway Clerks</I>, 466 U.S. 435, 448,
80 L. Ed. 2d 428, 104 S. Ct. 1883 (1984):
<P>
&quot;The test must be whether the challenged expenditures are
necessarily or reasonably incurred for the purpose of performing
the duties of an exclusive representative of the employees in
dealing with the employer on labor-management issues. Under this
standard, objecting employees may be compelled to pay their fair
share of not only the direct costs of negotiating and administering
a collective-bargaining contract and of settling grievances and
disputes, but also the expenses of activities or undertakings
normally or reasonably employed to implement or effectuate the
duties of the union as exclusive representative of the employees
in the bargaining unit.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<I>Cf.</I> <I>Lehnert</I>, 500 U.S. at 519:
<P>
&quot;Chargeable activities must (1) be 'germane' to collective-bargaining
activity; (2) be justified by the government's vital policy interest
in labor peace and avoiding 'free riders'; and (3) not significantly
add to the burdening of free speech that is inherent in the allowance
of an agency or union shop.&quot;
<P>
<B>But wherever the line between the chargeable and the nonchargeable
may be drawn in a particular case, the Supreme Court's decisions
leave no room for doubt that there is a line somewhere beyond
which the unions may not go without violating the Constitution</B>
<I>(*WEACN)</I>.<BR>

<P>
To protect the constitutional rights of all citizens of the United
States, 42 U.S.C. # 1983 recognizes a cause of action against
any person who, acting under color of law, subjects another to
the deprivation of rights secured by the Constitution. And the
district courts established by Congress pursuant to Article III
of the Constitution have been given original jurisdiction over
civil actions brought to recover damages or to secure equitable
or other relief under any Act of Congress, including # 1983, providing
for the protection of civil rights. See 28 U.S.C. # 1343(a)(4).
<P>
The statutory right to have an Article III court adjudicate suits
brought pursuant to # 1983 for vindication of rights secured by
the First Amendment of the Constitution cannot be foreclosed by
non-statutory arbitration conducted by a privately appointed decisionmaker.
See <I>McDonald v. City of West Branch, Mich</I>., 466 U.S. 284,
80 L. Ed. 2d 302, 104 S. Ct. 1799 (1984), where a unanimous Supreme
Court, speaking through Justice Brennan, so held in reversing
a decision in which our own court had given <I>res judicata</I>
effect to the decision of a private arbitrator appointed pursuant
to a collective bargaining agreement. See also <I>Alexander v.
Gardner-Denver, Co</I>., 415 U.S. 36, 39 L. Ed. 2d 147, 94 S.
Ct. 1011 (1974), holding that an arbitral award entered pursuant
to a collective bargaining agreement cannot foreclose a suit brought
under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <BR>

<P>
The arbitration initiated by the defendant unions here was conducted
under the procedure outlined by the Supreme Court in <I>Hudson</I>,
of course, and not under a collective bargaining agreement. But
<I>Hudson</I> did not purport to foreclose the remedy provided
for in # 1983. Citing McDonald, on the contrary, the <I>Hudson</I>
Court expressly recognized that &quot;the arbitrator's decision
would not receive preclusive effect in any subsequent # 1983 action.&quot;
<I>Hudson</I>, 475 U.S. at 308 n.21. (Emphasis supplied.) Cf.
<I>McDonald</I>, 466 U.S. at 292: &quot;courts should ever be
mindful that Congress . . . thought it necessary to provide a
judicial forum for the ultimate resolution of [these] claims.
<B>It is the duty of the courts to assure the full availability
of this forum</B>&quot; <I>(*WEACN)</I>. <I>Id</I>. at 292 n.13,
quoting <I>Gardner-Denver</I>, 415 U.S. at 60 n.21.<BR>

<P>
This is not to say that, under appropriate circumstances, an arbitral
decision may not be given considerable weight in the adjudication
of # 1983 actions. The weight to be accorded such a decision depends,
however, on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.
Again quoting <I>Gardner-Denver, id</I>. at 60 n.21, <I>McDonald</I>
says that among the factors relevant in this regard are these:
<P>
&quot;the degree of procedural fairness in the arbitral forum,
adequacy of the record with respect to the issue [in the judicial
proceeding], and the special competence of particular arbitrators.
Where an arbitral determination gives full consideration to an
employee's [statutory or constitutional] rights, a court may properly
accord it great weight. This is especially true where the issue
is solely one of fact, specifically addressed by the parties and
decided by the arbitrator on the basis of an adequate record.&quot;
<I>McDonald</I>, 466 U.S. at 292 n.13.<BR>

<P>
Reviewing these factors in relation to the record before us in
the case at bar, we are not persuaded that the district court
was justified in accepting the arbitrator's endorsement of the
unions' cost allocations without allowing discovery of the materials
on which the calculations were based. Our thinking on this runs
as follows.<BR>

<P>
&quot;'Procedural safeguards often have special bite in the First
Amendment context.' G. Gunther, Cases and Materials on Constitutional
Law 1373 (10th ed. 1980).*** The purpose of these safeguards is
to insure that the government treads with sensitivity in areas
freighted with First Amendment concerns.&quot; <I>Hudson</I>,
475 U.S. at 303 n.12. Among the procedural safeguards available
in a judicial forum are rules of evidence that treat hearsay with
skepticism, and discovery procedures that allow litigants to probe
their adversaries' cases in depth prior to hearing. These safeguards
were much attenuated here.<BR>

<P>
<B>The case presented to the arbitrator rested primarily on hearsay
-- upon summaries of documents that were not presented in evidence
and had not been made available for inspection by dissenters prior
to the arbitration hearing. It is true that the arbitrator had
authority under the Arbitration Association rules to order the
production of &quot;such additional evidence&quot; as he might
have deemed necessary to his &quot;understanding and determination
of the dispute.&quot; But it would not be realistic, in our view,
to expect the arbitrator to go through raw data at the hearing
as thoroughly as litigants commonly go through such data in pre-hearing
discovery. And like the rules of evidence, pre-hearing discovery
has been dispensed with under the rules that govern arbitrations
such as this one</B> <I>(*WEACN)</I>.<BR>

<P>
Even if the arbitration rules had been a mirror image of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, moreover, they would not necessarily
have insured the adequacy and reliability of the arbitral record
in this particular case. The fact is that arbitrator Brown --
<B>a man who is experienced in labor relations, presumably, but
who has not been shown to possess any special competence in First
Amendment law</B> <I>(*WEACN)</I> -- was not provided record information
that had been vetted prior to the hearing in such a way as to
inspire confidence that it could appropriately be used as the
basis of a definitive determination of the objectors' First Amendment
claims.<BR>

<P>
The absence of a record containing information that had been so
vetted is <B>by no means surprising. &quot;Arbitral factfinding
is generally not equivalent to judicial factfinding.&quot; <I>McDonald</I>,
466 U.S. at 291. &quot;The record of the arbitration proceeding
is not as complete; the usual rules of evidence do not apply;
and <I>rights and procedures common to civil trials, such as discovery
. . . are often severely limited or unavailable</I>.&quot; Gardner-Denver,
415 U.S. at 57-58. (Emphasis supplied). Thus it is that in a #
1983 action, at least, &quot;an arbitration proceeding cannot
provide an adequate substitute for a judicial trial.&quot; McDonald,
466 U.S. at 292.</B> <I>(*WEACN)</I>.
<P>
But if an arbitration proceeding is no substitute for a judicial
trial, the district court concluded that the arbitral award ought
to have a &quot;significant impact in subsequent judicial proceedings
. . . .&quot; Bromley, 843 F. Supp. at 1153. Otherwise, the court
suggested, &quot;the procedure spawned by the Supreme Court is
largely a waste of time and money.&quot; Id.<BR>

<P>
If in practical terms the &quot;impact&quot; of an arbitral award
on subsequent judicial proceedings is to be the denial of meaningful
pre-trial discovery, we do not believe that the &quot;waste of
time and money,&quot; if any, can justify such a denial. <B>The
right to discovery is a safeguard which -- to borrow the language
of <I>Hudson</I> again -- helps &quot;insure that the government
treads with sensitivity in areas freighted with First Amendment
concerns.&quot; </B><I>(*WEACN) Hudson</I>, 475 U.S. at 303 n.12.
<BR>

<P>
It is far from self-evident, moreover, that <I>Hudson</I> arbitration
would in fact become a waste of time and money unless its availability
were held to foreclose normal pre-trial discovery. As the Supreme
Court of California recently observed in rejecting a &quot;waste
of time&quot; argument based on the district court's opinion in
the case at bar, &quot;the time is not wasted if it offers a potential
for avoiding litigation<I>.&quot; Brosterhous v. State Bar of
California</I>, 12 Cal. 4th 315, 333, 906 P.2d 1242, 1253 (1995)
(citing <I>Hohe v. Casey</I>, 956 F.2d 399, 409 (3d Cir. 1992)).
<B>If <I>Hudson</I> arbitrators do their job properly, it seems
to us, the probability is that some of these controversies will
not reach the courts at all</B> <I>(*WEACN)</I>. <BR>

<P>
The defendant unions have invited our attention to another case,
<I>Miller v. Air Line Pilots Assn</I>, No. 91-3161 (D.D.C. August
30, 1995) (unpublished), where the &quot;waste of time and money&quot;
argument received a more favorable reception. The <I>Miller</I>
court went so far as to hold, indeed, as a matter of &quot;judicial
discretion,&quot; that arbitration remedies made available by
a union under<I> Hudson</I> must be exhausted as a precondition
to any non-member's bringing a civil rights action under # 1983.
If the exhaustion principle were to be applied in the case before
us, of course, only three of the 236 non-members who objected
to the agency fee would have standing to challenge the amount
of the fee in court.<BR>

<P>
In support of its ruling on the exhaustion issue, the <I>Miller</I>
court quoted extensively from a decision issued in the <I>Hudson</I>
litigation by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit following remand from the Supreme Court. <I>Hudson v.
Chicago Teachers Union</I>, 922 F.2d 1306 (7th Cir.), <I>cert.
denied</I>, 501 U.S. 1230, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1020, 111 S. Ct. 2852
(1991). The quoted passage begins with this sentence:
<P>
&quot;Requiring the Federal courts to micromanage the fee calculation
in every case challenging a union's [agency] fee would place an
overwhelming and unrealistic burden on the courts.&quot; <I>Hudson</I>,
922 F.2d at 1314. <BR>

<P>
<B>Taken out of context, the passage sounds like a powerful argument
in favor of an exhaustion requirement. In fact, however, we have
no reason to suppose that this was what the Seventh Circuit panel
had in mind</B> <I>(*WEACN)</I>.<BR>

<P>
The question being addressed by the panel was whether the notice
containing the union's explanation of the basis on which the amount
of the agency fee had been determined was adequate to pass constitutional
muster. The plaintiffs were arguing not only that the notice was
inadequate -- a proposition they did not push very hard -- but
also that the correctness of the amount had to be adjudicated
in court <I>before the fee could be collected and escrowed in
the first instance</I>. That was the argument to which the Seventh
Circuit panel was responding, as is clear from the sentence immediately
before the passage quoted in <I>Miller</I>:
<P>
&quot;Taken in its entirety, plaintiffs' challenge asserts that
a <I>prior</I> hearing and <I>prior</I> judicial determination
of the correctness of [an agency] fee is a precondition to the
<I>collection</I> of the fee.&quot; <I>Hudson</I>, 922 F.2d at
1314. (Emphasis supplied.)<BR>

<P>
In rejecting the plaintiffs' argument, the Seventh Circuit panel
did not hold that exhaustion of the arbitral remedy could be required
as a condition to the bringing of a # 1983 action. The exhaustion
issue was not before the panel at all, as we understand it.<BR>

<P>
In any event,<B> a panel of our own court has squarely rejected
the proposition that it is constitutional for an agency shop agreement
to require objecting employees to exhaust their arbitration remedies
before going into court on their constitutional claims </B><I>(*WEACN)</I>.
<I>Tierney v. City of Toledo</I>, 917 F.2d 927, 939-40 (6th Cir.
1990) (endorsing a district court's resolution of a comparable
issue in <I>Lowary v. Lexington Local Bd. of Educ</I>., 704 F.
Supp. 1456 (N.D. Ohio 1988), <I>aff'd on other grounds</I>, 903
F.2d 422 (6th Cir.), <I>cert. denied</I>, 498 U.S. 958 (1990)).
<BR>

<P>
In the case at bar the district court quoted language from this
court's decision in <I>Lowary</I> -- language that was also quoted
in <I>Weaver v. University of Cincinnati</I>, 970 F.2d 1523 (6th
Cir. 1992), <I>cert. denied</I>, 507 U.S. 917 (1993) -- to the
effect that &quot;the Supreme Court has suggested that courts
should not involve themselves in factual inquiries involved in
making a chargeability determination.&quot; <I>Lowary</I>, 903
F.2d at 433, and <I>Weaver</I>, 970 F.2d at 1535, citing Allen,
373 U.S. at 123-24, and <I>Abood</I>, 431 U.S. at 240, with a
&quot;see also&quot; reference to a 1987 Sixth Circuit decision
in the <I>Tierney</I> litigation, reported at 824 F.2d 1497, 1504-05.
None of these cases can fairly be read as foreclosing the discovery
sought by the plaintiffs here.<BR>

<P>
<I>Lowary</I> merely suggested that the district court was not
required to conduct a trial to determine chargeability if an independent
arbitrator had already made that determination and the plaintiff
employees had not taken issue with the content of the arbitrator's
decision. The plaintiffs in <I>Lowary</I>, as the panel was at
pains to point out, &quot;[did] not claim that the decisionmaker's
determinations were improper.&quot; <I>Lowary</I>, 903 F.2d at
433. The <I>Lowary</I> plaintiffs were objecting only to &quot;the
use of the procedure,&quot; not to the substantive result produced
thereby. <I>Id.</I> (<B>footnote</B>: The <I>Lowary</I> panel
also pointed out that under <I>Hudson</I>, a chargeability determination
by an independent arbitrator would not receive preclusive effect
in a subsequent # 1983 action. The panel went on to note that
the arbitrator's determination &quot;likely would be entitled
to great weight,&quot; 903 F.2d at 433 n.3, but this obviously
presupposes a determination based on an adequate and reliable
record.) In the case at bar, by contrast, the plaintiffs <I>are</I>
objecting to the substantive result reached by the arbitrator;
here the plaintiffs do indeed &quot;claim that the decisionmaker's
determinations were improper.&quot;
<P>
The pertinent challenge to the arbitrator's decision in <I>Weaver</I>
was based on a &quot;sequence of adjudication&quot; argument;
the plaintiffs contended that &quot;<B>an arbitrator should not
determine which portion of the exacted fees were chargeable to
nonmember employees before a district court decides the merits
of a constitutional challenge to the union's collection procedures.&quot;
<I>Weaver</I>, 970 F.2d at 1534 </B><I>(*WEACN)</I>. The <I>Weaver</I>
panel rejected that argument, relying on the reasoning of <I>Hudson</I>
and <I>Lowary</I>. <I>Weaver</I>, 970 F.2d at 1535. No corresponding
argument has been presented in the case at bar. (<B>footnote</B>:
In the case at bar, further discovery may show both that the summaries
on which the arbitrator relied were accurate and that the expenses
summarized therein were incurred for purposes that qualified as
chargeable under the tests prescribed by the Supreme Court. To
the extent that the summaries gave the arbitrator an accurate
picture of the underlying facts, and assuming reasonable competence
on the part of the arbitrator, the arbitrator's decision will
likely be entitled to great weight in that event.)<BR>

<P>
The <I>Weaver</I> panel was not called upon to decide whether
employees taking exception to the merits of arbitral chargeability
determinations can be denied the right to probe the factual underpinnings
of summary exhibits on which the arbitrator relied in making such
determinations. <I>Weaver</I>, as we read it, simply does not
support the denial of discovery in the case at bar. Neither does
<I>Allen</I>, 373 U.S. at 123-24, where the Court merely &quot;reminded
the parties of the availability of more practical alternatives
to litigation,&quot; or <I>Abood</I>, 431 U.S. at 240, which echoed
<I>Allen</I>, or <I>Tierney</I>, 824 F.2d at 1504-05, where the
point deemed &quot;important&quot; by the court was that &quot;the
dissenting non-union member can be compelled through arbitration
or otherwise to pay for only those sums which are fairly attributable
to [collective bargaining] agreement-related purposes . . . .&quot;
<I>Id</I>. at 1505.<BR>

<P>
<B>Given the importance of the constitutional interests at stake
in the case at bar, the district court should not have decided
the summary judgment motion without allowing meaningful discovery
first. In declining to allow any discovery beyond the arbitration
record and the election forms, it seems to us, the district court
clearly abused its discretion </B><I>(*WEACN)</I>. <BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B>III<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The plaintiffs claim to have identified two categories of expenditures
that ought to have been held non-chargeable as a matter of law:
expenditures for &quot;extra-unit litigation&quot; and for &quot;defensive
organizing.&quot;<BR>

<P>
Extra-unit litigation means litigation that does not directly
concern the particular bargaining unit in which the objecting
employee works. Whether the objecting employee can be required
to contribute to the cost of such litigation proved to be a difficult
question for our panel in light of the Supreme Court's fractured
decision in <I>Lehnert</I>, 500 U.S. 507, 114 L. Ed. 2d 572, 111
S. Ct. 1950. The question has now been answered in the affirmative
by <I>Reese v. City of Columbus</I>, 71 F.3d 619 (6th Cir. 1995),
however, and <I>Reese</I> is binding on us under our circuit precedent
rule. On remand, therefore, reasonable extra-unit litigation costs
should be treated as chargeable.<BR>

<P>
Defensive organizing, as used here, covers a wide range of activities
designed to protect and strengthen the status of unions that have
already achieved bargaining agent recognition. The rubric includes,
among other things, membership retention efforts, resistance to
decertification proceedings, and defense against challenges from
other unions.<BR>

<P>
In <I>Ellis</I> the Supreme Court held that it would be &quot;perverse&quot;
to allow unions to force objecting nonmembers to fund the union's
&quot;costs of attempting to convince them to become members.&quot;
<I>Id</I>., 466 U.S. at 452 n.13. <B>We think it would be equally
perverse to require the plaintiffs to help underwrite actions
designed solely to allow the union to perpetuate itself by maintaining
the loyalties of existing members</B> <I>(*WEACN)</I>. See <I>Reese
v. City of Columbus</I>, 798 F. Supp. 463, 470 (S.D. Ohio 1992),
rev'd on other grounds, 71 F.3d 619, where the court explained
that &quot;defensive organizing would serve only the union's self-interest
in perpetuating itself as the sole representative of the bargaining
unit, a goal which is not germane to collective bargaining activity
and which may add to the burden on an objector's First Amendment
rights since the objector may favor some other union or no union.&quot;
On remand, defensive organizing costs that serve only this purpose
should be treated as non-chargeable. <BR>

<P>
The plaintiffs contend that there is a genuine issue of material
fact, at least, as to whether certain categories of administrative
costs that were treated as chargeable in their entirety should
instead have been allocated proportionally between chargeable
and non-chargeable activities, as were other overhead costs. We
agree. In opposing the motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs
submitted an affidavit in which Irving B. Ross, a certified public
accountant with a wealth of relevant experience, raised serious
questions about the treatment of the administrative costs at issue.
These questions should be addressed by the district court after
the plaintiffs have had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery.
<BR>

<P>
The plaintiffs further contend that there is a genuine issue of
fact as to the reasonableness of the method used by the unions
in calculating the chargeable portion of two programs -- known
as &quot;UniServ&quot; and the &quot;Unified Legal Service Program&quot;
-- under which the National Educational Association makes grants
to its state affiliates. Expenditures for these programs were
allocated according to the chargeable percentage of funds given
to the Michigan Education Association, and not according to the
chargeable percentage of funds given across the country.<BR>

<P>
The plaintiffs' expert witness, Mr. Ross, expressed the opinion
in his affidavit that &quot;there is no basis in generally accepted
accounting procedures that supports allocating all of NEA's UniServ
and ULSP expenditures based on percentages derived from a single
agency fee state affiliate . . . .&quot; Mr. Ross did not explain
how he reached this conclusion, however, and on the record before
us we are constrained to say that the allocation method used by
the unions appears reasonable.<BR>

<P>
Finally, the plaintiffs point out that they filed a motion for
class certification that was denied solely because the grant of
summary judgment rendered it moot. The motion will not be moot
when the summary judgment is vacated, of course, and we assume
that the district court will revisit the class certification question
in due course.<BR>

<P>
For the reasons stated we <B>VACATE</B> the order in which the
plaintiffs' complaint was dismissed pursuant to Rule 56, Fed.
R. Civ. P., and we <B>REMAND</B> the case for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.<BR>

<BR>Against Teachers Unions--Others Invited to Join <IMG SRC="head5.gif"><BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00006.GIF" align=left><FONT SIZE=2>On October 10, 1996, over 150 Washington state teachers
filed a civil rights, class action lawsuit under the First and
Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as a way
to protect and exercise their rights to freedom of speech, association,
petition, belief, and thought.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The plaintiffs are asking the court to grant:   
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>a) damages or restitution for un-constitutional collection
of fees, plus interest; b) injunctive relief against the attempted
future col-lection of unconsti-tutional agency fees; and c) reasonable
attorneys' fees.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><U><B><FONT SIZE=2>The Charges<BR>
</FONT></B></U></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The local education associations, Washington Education
Association, UniServ Councils, and National Education Association
are charged with acting in concert with school districts to collect
representation fees from nonmember em-ployees without pro-viding
all the con-stitutionally required procedural safeguards and in
amounts which exceed that permitted by the US Supreme Court.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The suit contends that portions of the union-determined
&quot;chargeable&quot; part of the agency fee have been and will
be used for activities unrelated to collective bargaining and
will significantly burden the challengers' free speech rights.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><U><B><FONT SIZE=2>Union Expenditures Challenged<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Union expenditures which are being challenged include,

to pay only their <I>fair share</I> of the costs of collective
bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment
which the union can <I>PROVE by a preponderance of the evidence</I>.
 They do not believe it is fair for the union to force them to

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> If the court certifies the &quot;class&quot; of
objecting nonmembers, there are potentially over 2000 education
employees who will benefit from the court's decision.  However,
if the court does not certify the &quot;class,&quot; then only
those who have signed up for the lawsuit will be entitled to relief.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5><IMG SRC="head7.gif">  Public Disclosure Commission Grills WEA
on Misuse of Union Dues<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The Public Disclosure Commission (PDC) has assigned
full time staff to investigate &quot;its number one priority,&quot;
the Washington Education Association.  The PDC is investigating
a laundry list of alleged </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>political finance violations by the WEA. Susan Harris,
Assistant Director of the PDC, stated that the agency has never
had an investigation &quot;of this breadth and depth&quot; in
its history.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The alleged violations under investi-gation include
the following:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Illegal extraction of &quot;Community Out-reach Funds&quot;
from members;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Illegal financing of initiative campaigns with members'
dues;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Illegal use of member dues for PAC overhead costs;</FONT>

</FONT></B></U></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Both WEA Executive Director, Jim Seibert, and WEA
General Counsel, Kathy O'Toole, stated under oath that Community
Outreach Funds are political in nature.  This additional $12 fee
is assessed on every WEA member without their written consent
as required by Initiative 134. The WEA may have placed school
districts in jeopardy of violating RCW 42.17.680-3 by using them
to deduct the political funds from teachers paychecks without
their written consent. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><U><B><FONT SIZE=2>Initiatives 173/177 Violations</FONT></B></U></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> WEA's (not the PAC's) 1996 budget indicated that
WEA planned to spend $1.4 million to defeat Initiatives 173 and
177.  The &quot;NO on 173/177 Committee&quot; reported WEA and
WEA affiliate contributions of  $763,189, through October 15,
but WEA's PDC reports  fail to report the campaign contributions.
 It is suspected that the contributions were directed illegally
from Community Outreach funds and members dues-a violation of
state and federal law.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>WEA-PAC is not reporting
overhead costs to the PDC as required by law.  (WEA-PAC is housed
in the WEA facility.)  WEA officials claimed at an arbitration
hearing that PAC overhead costs such as paper, copying, secretarial
services, electricity, etc., are &quot;charged back from WEA&quot;
implying that WEA-PAC is reimbursing WEA for its overhead expenses.
 However, the expenses have <I>not</I> been reported as <I>paid</I>
on PDC documents.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Regarding the $162,255 loan by WEA to WEA-PAC which
was then &quot;forgiven,&quot;  WEA has given conflicting answers
to where the money came from, how it is being repaid, and for
what purpose  the money was used.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> WEA Challengers ask that the PDC put its full weight
into the investigation considering the scope and magnitude of
the allegations, the millions of dollars obtained and spent illegally,
and the impact on thousands of school employees.<BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>Public Employment Relations Commission
Cites Spokane Education Association for Illegal and Coercive Contract
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><U><B><FONT SIZE=2>But PERC dismisses complaint on minor
technicality<BR>
</FONT></B></U></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC)
agrees with Jerry Hughes, a veteran high school teacher and former
Democratic state representative and senator from Spokane. Hughes,
who describes himself as a long-time union supporter, filed a
multiple unfair labor practice complaint against the Spokane Education
Association for illegal and coercive tactics and contract language.
 He alleged that the SEA sought to divorce itself from its legal
obligations to represent members and that it violated teachers'
collective bargaining rights. PERC concurred with Hughes. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>PERC ruled that the SEA's endorsement of site charter
&quot;sign off&quot; language which forces teachers to acknowledge
the authority of the school site and be bound by its future decisions
creates a legal shield between the union and its members, i.e.,
the union would not be liable to honor its legal obligations to
members under collective bar-gaining laws.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Because the SEA is the exclusive bargaining representative
of school employees in Spokane School District, PERC ruled that
it is illegal for the SEA to assist in  setting up separate bargaining
units at the school sites and to empower them to seek <I>binding
variances</I> from the district-wide collective bargaining contract.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> PERC noted that while SEA could undoubtedly abandon
its representation mission and &quot;go out of the union business,&quot;
 any attempt by the SEA to abandon part of its membership would
place its status in question for the entire organization.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> PERC ruled that the SEA promoted  illegal and coercive
contract language which requires employees to sign the site council
charter as a <I>condition of employment</I>.  The contract states
that new employees or voluntary transfers would be denied a job
unless they sign off on the charter.  Involuntary transfers would
be placed on the substi-tute teacher list if they didn't sign.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>    SEA made no attempt to justify its legal and
ethical violations, but instead filed an appeal on the failure
of Mr. Hughes to send the union a copy of his complaint.  While
PERC agreed that the SEA had committed three grievous unfair labor
practices, it dismissed the complaint based on this minor techni-cality!</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> It is certain that other teachers will challenge
the bullying and coercive tactics of the union.</FONT>
<P>

of this case.  <BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>Possible WEA/Blue Cross</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5> Scam Uncovered<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> It has recently been discovered that WEA and Blue
Cross may have conspired to funnel teachers benefit dollars into
the WEA's political warchest.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> For approximately four years, the WEA has promoted
the Blue Cross Health Plan but apparently not for the best interests
of the members.  A review of the WEA-PAC documents reveals that
Blue Cross dues are being deposited into WEA-PAC accounts.</FONT>
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00002.GIF" align=left>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation
staff attorney, Milton Chappell notes that it is a common NEA
and health insurance scam to bill members for an over-priced insurance
policy and then rebate part of the charges back to the PAC. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> In Michigan, the MEA and Blue Cross conspired to
assess members $1,000 above the identical health plan offered
to other groups in the state.  Once received, Blue Cross rebated
funds to the union PAC.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> This WEA/Blue Cross collusion is under investigation.
 If you carry WEA/NEA sponsored insurance or securities, or if
you subscribe to services which offer union discounts, be aware
that you may be subsidizing the union's political agenda.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><U><B><FONT SIZE=5>Is It Helping or Hurting Children?
<BR>
</FONT></B></U></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Dr. John E. Berthoud,Vice President of the Alexis
de Tocqueville Insti-tution (AdTI), con-ducted an in-depth analysis
of the NEA's legislative proposals and came up with some surprising
facts.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> According to the report, &quot;The Fiscal Impact
of NEA's Legislative Agenda,&quot; if all of NEA's proposals were
adopted into law, federal spending would increase by $702 billion
per year.  Financing the new spending would impose either a new
tax burden of $10,554 per year for a family of four or bigger
federal deficits.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> NEA claims to be primarily interested in the education
and welfare of children, but the report reveals a strong bias
in favor of retirees.  For each dollar in new spending for children
and education, NEA  advocates $5.24 in new spending on  Social
Security.  The NEA proposes $24.2 billion in new spending for
children and education, but it proposes $126.76 billion in new
spending on Social Security.  </FONT>
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00003.GIF" align=right>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Another NEA proposal  includes a  national single-payer
health care system  which would add $534,600 million per year
in new federal spending.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The report notes that the NEA's support for &quot;continuation
of the Cabinet-level U.S. Department of Education,&quot; does
not increase or decrease any current federal spending.  However,
another AdTI study, &quot;The Budgetary Implications of Eliminating
the U.S. Department of Education,&quot; reports that ending the
cabinet status of Education would save $15.7 billion over five
years.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> In yet another study by AdTI, &quot;A Fiscal Analysis
of NEA and AFL-CIO Contributions to 1996 Congressional Races,&quot;
the NEA financed candidates who voted in the first session of
the 104th Congress to expand government  by approximately $30
billion per year while it opposed those who voted to cut government.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Send documentation of union activities that you

  You can call Milt at 1 (800) 336-3600.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Also, report any programs that you suspect may be
a front for funneling funds into political or other non-essential
activities (workshops, parent organizing, &quot;charitable&quot;
outreach programs, discount services for members, etc.).    </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Remember, you are entitled to attend any activity
sponsored by the union which it considers &quot;chargeable.&quot;
 This includes workshops, conferences, leadership programs, community
organizing meetings, etc.  (The union claims that 83% of their
activity is chargeable, so you could virtually attend anything
the union sponsors.)  Materials from these activities should be
directed to Milt Chappell.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Initiative 134 was supposed to be a way of curbing
the clout of special interests.  The initiative limits PAC contributuions
to $1,000 per candidate.  However, it allows an oganization to
spend an <I>unlimited amount</I> on mailings, radio spots, and
other political advertising as long as the candidate's campaign
did not coordinate the effort.  Robert Maier, lobbyist for WEA,
described the loophole in a <I>Seattle Times </I>article as &quot;a
way you can spend, and go around the expenditure limits.&quot;
 He added, &quot;In my view it's clearly the chief loophole in
the law.&quot;  </FONT>
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00005.GIF" align=left>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> As one example, while the WEA-PAC was limited to
contributing $1,000 to the re-election campaign of Democrat state
representative Sue Karahalios, the loophole allowed WEA to contribute
an additional $15,000 to a labor PAC, the Coalition for Better
Government run by WEA Executive Director James Siebert.  That
PAC spent an additional $8,408 on mailings and radio ads for Karahalios.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4> Robert Maier unabashedly conceded that the money
spent on independent expenditures &quot;will be amazing&quot; this year because of the higher stakes.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> It should be noted that big business also capitalizes
on the loophole to support its candidates.  There is an important
difference between the labor contributions and those of business,
however.  Individuals who donate to a business PAC do so voluntarily
because he or she shares the beliefs and goals of the organization.
  Teachers, however, hold a wide diversity of political views
and in many cases oppose the union's political agenda; yet they
are forced to pay for its political advocacy through mandatory
fees.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The teachers union regularly flaunts the law when
it comes to grabbing hardworking teachers' money.  When Initiative
134 passed, it required the teachers union to obtain written permission
from teachers before extracting money for  political campaigns.
 To circumvent this inconvenient law, the WEA  raised dues on
all members and called it an &quot;outreach assessment.&quot;
  This $12 assessment (for which the union does not get written
permission) is currently under investigation since union officials
have admitted under oath that the assessment is used for political
activity.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The teachers union regularly defends itself as a
&quot;bipartisan&quot; organization.  <I>The Washington Times</I>
published an expose on just how &quot;bipartisan&quot; the NEA

<IMG SRC="head5.gif"><B> Teachers Mount Statewide Lawsuit Against Washington Education Association</B>
<IMG SRC="head5.gif"></FONT></CENTER></H5>
The settlement obtained by 121 education employees who challenged the Washington Education Association in 1994 over what they viewed as the unconstitutional use of their dues for political purposes expires this summer.   The 1994 settlement resulted in a $200-$300 reduction in dues per year for two years.    (Non-members have a legal right to challenge the amount WEA claims it spends on politics. The WEA and its arbitrator cite approximately 20% of dues is spent on politics. The 1994 challengers, however, received a 50% dues reduction when using independent counsel.)</P>
Because the 1994 settlement is expiring, the educators are mounting a new lawsuit against the WEA.   They seek to pay only their fair share of collective bargaining and maintenance of contractual benefits and rights.<p>
National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation (NRWLDF) has agreed to defend the school employees.  The Foundation&#146;s sole purpose is providing free legal aid to employees suffering violations of their human and civil rights because of injustices arising from the abuses of compulsory union membership.   NRWLDF attorney, Milt Chappel, will serve as lead counsel in the federal lawsuit and trial.  He will perform the majority of the legal work, including discovery and &#147;auditing&#148; of WEA&#146;s books.  </P>
However, the education employ-ees are engaging attorney, Steve O&#146;Ban, of Ellis, Li &amp; McKinstry, to  coor-dinate local court requirements.  O&#146;Ban served as lead negotiator for the 1994 settlement. Ellis, Li &amp; McKinstry, P.L.L.C. was instrumental in obtaining the NRWLDF com-mitment.    </P>
The WEA Challenger Network will continue its educational efforts  to update challengers and will gather input.
Kristy Bergland, paralegal with Casey, Gore, and Grewe, P.S., will coordinate local admin-istration of education employees&#146; signing onto the lawsuit.  She will also answer challengers&#146; administrative questions.</P>
<P><B><I><U>Cost to Join</U></I></B></P>
Although NRWLDF is providing the lion&#146;s share of the legal work, there will be expenses for the local attorney&#146;s services, the administration of the suit, and the ongoing education/communica-tion expenses of the WEA Chal-lenger Network.  These expenses will be covered by a fee of $150 for each challenger.  The fees will go in a trust account and  be drawn on as expenses warrant.</P>
The initial $150 fee is expected to sustain expenses up until the point of trial.  If the lawsuit goes to trial (approximately 12-24 months from now), another $150 fee may be assessed.  Total fees for each challenger would be capped at $300 for he duration of the lawsuit (a reduction from the $400 cap from the last state-wide challenge). </P>
The current fee structure assumes that at least 200 school employees join the suit.
<P><B><I><U>How to Join</U></I></B></P>
Employees  interested in joining this lawsuit must call Kristy Bergland at (509) 326-7500 or return the enclosed response </I><I>sheet by </I><B><I>August 15</I></B><I>.  Kristy will send a packet which includes the retainer and authorization forms for legal </I><I>representation, the fee agreement,  and detailed explanations of challengers&#146; rights  to be non-union members who </I><I>pay only for collective bargaining, contract maintenance and grievance resol-ution.   The packet will also note how to </I><I>obtain reasonable liability insurance to replace the WEA&#146;s.</I></P>
After receiving the packet, school employees may join the suit by returning the appropriate forms and fee by </I><B><I>August 31</I></B><I>.  </I><I>Once this is done, NRWLDF will shepherd the challengers through the legal process and take care of all communications </I><I>with the WEA.</I></P>

<P>The function of the union is to represent its members without discriminating against them for their personal beliefs.  </P>
<P>Two incidents that I personally experienced this year have convinced me that the WEA has a one-dimensional viewpoint.  If you do not go along with the WEA&#146;s positions, you  (the one who pays the dues!) are labelled with offensive adjectives.  </P>
<P>In the Riverside UniServ Council&#146;s December &#146;95 publi-cation, &#147;The Report Card,&#148; the union expressed potential  support for the Interfaith Alliance  The article stated, &#147;The goal of the Alliance is to provide a voice for the mainline churches and their followers who believe the radical right Christian Coalition does not represent their views.&#148;  </P>
<P>I was offended that the Christian Coalition (which happens to have many members from mainline churches) was identified as &#147;radical right.&#148;  UniServ leaders did not apologize when I pointed out the use of the offensive label.</P>
<P>The second incident occurred near the end of this school year.  The WEA Deputy Executive Director presented a workshop on &#147;Organizing for Public Educa-tion&#148; in the Battleground School District.  During his presenta-tion, he singled out the Evergreen Freedom Foundation, a conservative think tank and public policy institute, as an example of &#147;people from the radical far right who have a different agenda and are out to destroy public education.&#148;  In a letter of concern over this mischaracterization, I noted that these people are not out to destroy public education but they have legitimate concerns about many state and federal education reform laws&#151;views shared by many teachers!  </P>
<P>WEA publications and work-shops, like those mentioned above, malign those who disagree with the union as unsupportive of public education and &#147;radical right.&#148;  WEA funds this political activity against many of its own members  with our union dues.  The union should respect, not insult, all members regardless of the diversity of their views.  </P>
<P><B>I support the legitimate functions of the union&#151;collective bar-gaining, etc., but I do not wish to pay that portion of my </B><B>dues which supports the union&#146;s political agenda.</B>
<P><B> </B><B><I>Ken Evans, Battleground  School District</I></B></P>
<P>  </P>
<P><B>&#147;If the NEA-supported congressional candidates had all been elected and passed the legislative wish list of the NEA, it </B><B>would increase national spend-ing by $302 billion per year.&#148;</B>

<IMG SRC="head7.gif"><B> My Journey from Union Service to Union Resignation </B>
</FONT></CENTER></P>
<P><B><I>Those of us who joined the 1994  withdrawal from and challenge to the union did so for many reasons.  Friends have asked </I></B><B><I>me why I left.  That is a good question, especially from those who know that I worked hard for my local union for years.</I></B></P>
<P><B><I>I had been feeling increasingly alien in the union.  I became aware of the rift as education decision-making was shifted into </I></B><B><I>the political arena.  Being a political conservative I could not support many of the candidates and issues that the union </I></B><B><I>endorsed.</I></B></P>
<P><B><I>These are some of the questions that I investigated.  What is the essential role of my bargaining unit?    Has its expanded </I></B><B><I>role been directed carefully and with approval from the members?  Could, I with reasonable expenditure of time and </I></B><B><I>energy, influence the course of the union on given issues?  Do I feel right about the way the money I give in dues is </I></B><B><I>spent?  Is the trend of the union consistent with what I feel is best for education, the region, state, and country?</I></B></P>
<P><B><I>As I sought answers, my discomfort only grew.  To live by my convictions I needed to leave the union.  Then I heard that </I></B><B><I>there were other members who were looking into their options to union membership and I joined them.  That was the </I></B><B><I>state-wide challenge of 1994 by 121 school employees.</I></B></P>
<P><B><I>I continue to feel good about resigning from the union to become what is called an &#147;agency shop fee payer.&#148;  I am sorry </I></B><B><I>that I am seen by some as a freeloader instead of a person who is convinced that dues should only be spent on essential </I></B><B><I>union services.</I></B></P>
<P><B><I>I will join the new lawsuit.  Not because I did two years ago, but because the issues are the same.</I></B></P>

</FONT></P>
<P>The 1996  WEA Representative Assembly recently passed the Revised Reengineering Team Report and a number of resolutions which may be place teachers&#146; job security, their constitutional and civil rights, and their rights to be fairly represented by the union  in jeopardy.</P>
<P><U>WEA&#146;s &#147;Core Values&#148; Take Priority Over Fair Treatment for All</U></P>
<P>At the 1996 WEA Repre-sentative Assembly, a resolution was passed to require the WEA to assist locals in developing criteria which are consistent with <B><I>WEA goals and core values</I></B>(emphasis added) for determining how extensively to represent members.  </P>
<P>While the resolution has been publicized as a way to undercut automatic representation of teachers in chronic trouble, one might legitimately question whether this practice will place school employees who do not agree with the union&#146;s liberal &#147;core values&#148; or school restructuring agenda at risk for non-representation.  In fact, the WEA Representative Work Group Report states, &#147;Such criteria are useful in deciding whether to represent anyone, not just the person with repeated problems.&#148;</P>
<P>It is noteworthy that it took an amendment from the floor to revise the resolution to state that the WEA will continue to represent members whose due process and contractual rights are violated.  The WEA notes in its Representation Work Group Report, however, that, &#147;tech-nically, due process is required only if a person is being deprived of a property interest, liberty, or life.&#148;  </P>
<P>In the same Report, WEA leaders and staff acknowledge that they fear violating WEA&#146;s legal duty of fair representation.  Despite this, the resolution  was passed. </P>
<P>The WEA also intends  to revise the current policies and practices  for employees to submit  appeals to the union&#146;s decision not to represent the school employee. </P>
<P>The 1996  WEA Representative Assembly passed the Revised Re-engineering Team Report and a number of resolutions which may  place teachers&#146; job security, their constitutional and civil rights, as well as their right to fair repre-sentation, in jeopardy.</P>
<P>A resolution was passed to re-quire the WEA to assist locals in developing and using criteria which are <B><I>&#147;consistent with </I></B><B><I>WEA goals and core values&#148; </I></B>for determining whether or not to represent individuals.  </P>
<P>The resolution has been pub-licized as a way to undercut auto-matic representation of teachers in chronic trouble.

<P><B><I>Multiple Unfair Labor Practice Complaint Filed Against SEA</I></B></P>
<P>Claiming that the Spokane Edu-cation Association (SEA) has willfully violated the law and its fiduciary responsibilities to dues paying members, a long-time Washington state teaching veter-an and avid union supporter has filed a five part unfair labor prac-tice complaint against the SEA.  </P>
<P>The teacher (who has requested anonomity because the com-plaint has not yet been heard by the Public Employment Relations Commission) alleges that SEA procedures during collective bar-gaining and school restructuring activities violate the Constitu-tional and Labor Law rights of dues paying members.  </P>
<P>The teacher stated, &#147;The union has sold us down the river.   In all my years of teaching, I have never before experienced these tactics.  The district and union have mounted a united effort to shove an agenda down teachers&#146; throats.&#148;  The unfair labor practices which the complainant alleges include the following: </P>
<P><B><U>Mandatory &#147;Sign Off&#148; Guts Employee Protection</U></B></P>
<P>The SEA and school district have implemented new contract language which requires staff members to &#147;sign off&#148; on a statement acknowledging the binding authority of school based site councils and their unknown future decisions.  The mandatory sign off  guts employee protection by eliminating employees&#146; legal right to sue for misdeeds or contractual violations by the council and SEA.     By  willfully failing to disclose to members the effects of the sign off,   the SEA has committed &#147;a breach of faith, a violation of workers right to know, and an unfair labor practice.&#148;</P>
<P><B><U>SEA Creates Legal Shield Against Employee Claims</U></B></P>
<P>Secondly, when the SEA helped create and empower 57 potential school based site councils, it facilitated the illegal frag-mentation of its legally desig-nated &#147;exclusive bargaining unit authority.&#148;  The site councils are given the authority to alter school procedures, policies, and contrac-tual  benefits and rights.  </P>
<P>The SEA is shielded from  its legal duty to protect  members because the forced &#147;sign off&#148; gives binding authority to the site.    Consequently, employees are hung out to dry with NO pro-tection from contractual violations.  It is illegal to empower a site council with the authority to grant a contract variance unless the SEA is formally decertified as the exclusive bargaining repre-sentative.</P>
<P><B><U>SEA Bargains Coercive Transfer Language</U></B></P>
<P>Thirdly, the SEA also bargained for blatantly coercive transfer language to insure that the joint district/SEA restructuring agenda would not be impeded.  </P>
<P>The new contract language forces a transferee to sign off to the site charter of the new school or he/she will be denied the transfer.  If the staff member is involuntarily transferred and refuses to sign off on the school charter, the staff member becomes a permanent substitute.  This is a violation of an employee&#146;s right to be free from coercion.  Cindy Omlin, a fellow school district employee, stated, &#147;The new sign off and transfer language is employment extortion&#151;a total  abuse of authority.  It will allow schools to squeeze out competent employees with diverse or dissenting  views.    It&#146;s a sledge hammer held over all employees.&#148;</P>
<P><B><U>SEA Rigged Election</U></B></P>
<P>Two other unfair labor practices were cited by the complainant.  The SEA assisted in illegally coding ballots in a charter vote in order to identify dissenters.  By violating the legally protected secrecy of the ballot, employees may  face potential harassment, intimidation, and other punitive actions which create a hostile work environment. </P>
<P> </P>
<P>The SEA also interfered in the guarantee of a fair election by convoluting the ballots.  Rather than providing a ballot with a traditional &#147;yes&#148; or &#147;no&#148; vote, the union added another option which stated, &#147;I Have Concern, But I Believe I Can Live With It.&#148; If the voter had read the footnote at the bottom of the page, however, he would have found that this confusing option (which seems to register dissent) is counted as a &#147;Yes&#148; vote.  The deceptive ballot violated employees&#146; rights to self organization and fair elections.</P>
<P>Relief sought by the complainant includes invalidation of the sign off language and the illegal fragmentation of the bargaining unit (which allows the SEA to abandon its designated obligations to dues paying members), and invalidation of the coded and convoluted charter election.</P>
<P>The WEA Challenger Network applauds the courage of the complainant. The SEA&#146;s abandonment of members to advance a  union supported school restructuring agenda is shameless. These complaints are being heard around the state.  Please document the situations and inform the WEA Challenger Network.  Relief may be available.</P>

Michigan Education Association and NEA kingpins had attempted to use socalled &#147;arbitration&#148; boards to deny educators access to information about how their dues were spent.  National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation attorneys successfully rebuffed the attempt.<p>
&#147;These arbitration schemes are phony and cannot be used to cover up Big Labor&#146;s unconstitutional use of compulsory union dues for politics,&#148; stated Reed Larsen, president of the National Right to Work Foundation.  &#147;These kangaroo courts are rigged up by the NEA bosses only to stiffarm educators who challenge the use of their forced dues for politics.&#148;  (Agency shop fee payers who do not use independent counsel to challenge the use of their dues for political purposes must go through the cumbersome, union-controlled arbitration process.)</P>
 WEA staff are &#147;setting aside...routine and traditional activities (representing members?) to focus their energy and resources (your dues!) on electing officials who share the WEA vision.&#148;</P>

<FONT SIZE=3 COLOR="#0000A0"><B><I>The WEA Challenger Network</I></B><I> is a grassroots coalition of Washington State public education employees who are </I><I>taking a stand against use of our union dues for political activity by the local, state (WEA), and national (NEA) </I><I>education associations.  This newsletter is to inform you of your legal rights, document political spending </I><I>financed by dues, and provide other pertinent information for those who believe that the union does not </I><I>represent their beliefs.

<IMG SRC="head2.gif" WIDTH = 57 HEIGHT = 27><B><I> WEA Pushes Members Aside for WEA Agenda </I></B></FONT></H2>
<P> In his address to the 1995 Representative Assembly, WEA President C.T. Purdom stated that the WEA and current public school system are headed for impending &#147;death.&#148;  &#147;Unless WEA...is willing to change,&#148; he posits, &#147;we face certain death.  And it is a death that will surely hasten the demise of public education.&#148;  </P>
<P> While many  union members agree that the union needs a drastic overhaul,  they may be shocked to know that WEA leadership considers the members to be its main problem!   Purdom stated that members must  give up their &#147;need to control&#148; the WEA so that hired staff can accomplish the work of the organization.   WEA members who oppose proposed changes will be responsible for the WEA&#146;s &#147;death&#148;--&#147;We have met the enemy and it is us,&#148; he says.</P>
<P> Purdom noted that the WEA has &#147;adopted a radically different mission, goal and objectives.&#148; The new WEA will focus first on &#147;reflecting a philosophical shift that emphasizes improving public confidence in our public schools&#148; and second on supporting its membership--an historic change in philosophy!  The WEA Reengineering Team&#146;s only goal for the WEA is &#147;to build confidence in public education and increase support for Washington&#146;s public school system.&#148;  (November 1995 WEA Action)</P>
<P> The Reengineering Report states that members and staff must accept major philosophical change:  </P>
<P> &#147;Association staff and member leaders will shift from emphasizing their roles as service-providers to emphasizing their roles as consultants, facilitators, and advisors.&#148;   </P>
<P> Joe Chrastil, a national labor organizer hired by the union, exposed  WEA&#146;s planned dereliction of duty at a Chicago Parent Organizing Project workshop. Responding to a question about union protection of teachers, he replied:</P>
<P>  &#147;(Union staff) have a legal obligation to do that (protect teachers) through their contract to make sure that they have due process, but they have a lot of latitude about how far they have to go with the grievance process. . .  and they are, quite frankly, looking for excuses to be able to just say, &#145;Look, here&#146;s your rights; this is what you need to do, and good luck!&#146;  </P>
<P> Chrastil explains, &#147;One of the things (union leaders) are suggesting gives them that opportunity is that the union no longer has a mission just to support teachers in terms of wages, terms and conditions of employment.  And as the mission of the union becomes equally organizing around the broader community issues in support for public education, they become free to say, &#147;I (the union) don&#146;t have time to do all that (representing teachers) because another major portion of my job is this (gaining public support).  </P>
<P> &#145;Plus the relationship (of the union) with the principal and the parents are equally important and your job is not--the job that you&#146;re doing is threatening that.&#146;&#148;  (August 1995 Parent Organizing Project Workshop, Chicago, IL)</P>
<P> WEA members and agency shop fee payers pay for and expect representation for the improvement of wages, benefits, and working conditions, and for protection of their contractual rights.  If this responsibility is sacrificed for the sake of improving public perception, members may justifiably wonder why they should belong to WEA! </P>
<P><B> </B><B>Furthermore, WEA plans NO reduction in dues to compensate members for its reduction in service. </B></P>
<H2>
<FONT SIZE=5>
<IMG SRC="head2.gif" WIDTH = 57 HEIGHT = 27><B><I> Your Union Dues At Work </I></B></FONT></H2>
<P> As WEA shifts from representing  members as its main priority to become public education&#146;s premiere public relations agency, dues will increasingly be used for media campaigns and diverted to other organizations who share WEA&#146;s political ideology.   A look at Public Disclosure Commission documents reveals the following activities funded by dues in addition to the $16,300 WEA spends monthly on lobbying:</P>
<P><B><U>August 1995:</U></B></P>
<P>$125,234 - TV ads, focus groups, radio time</P>
<P><B><U>September 1995:</U></B></P>
<P>$224,818 - TV ads, political ads, telemarketing, polling</P>
<P>$    5,000 -  State Democratic Party</P>
<P><B><U>October 1995:</U></B></P>
<P>$126,060 - TV ads, mailing, anti-voucher videos, brochures, posters, postcards</P>
<P>$   5,000 -   State Democratic Party</P>
<P>$   5,000 -  &#147;NO on 48&#148; </P>
<P> </P>
<P> Initiative 134 made it illegal for WEA to automatically deduct PAC contributions from members.  As a result, PAC contributions fell from 45,000 members to 8,000 members! </P>
<P> To counteract the loss in PAC money,  WEA devised a new political strategy.  It raised everyone&#146;s dues by $12 (more than making up for the loss in PAC contributions) and  now funnels dues to the media and the Democratic Party to accomplish its political objectives.  </P>
<P><B> </B><B>PAC numbers reveal that only 17.7% of WEA members voluntarily finance WEA&#146;s agenda.  To get around </B><B>the lack of widespread member support, WEA instead raises compulsory dues over which rank and file </B><B>members have NO control.</B></P>

<IMG SRC="head7.gif" WIDTH = 72 HEIGHT = 30><B> Money and Control: NEA Just Can&#146;t Get Enough </B>
<IMG SRC="head7.gif" WIDTH = 72 HEIGHT = 30></FONT></CENTER></P>
<P> A WEA spokesperson  has verified that the NEA is considering extending membership to private school employees and health care professionals.  It was decided at the 1995 NEA Representative Assembly that state affiliates should consider the issue first.  After state discussions, extension of union membership would be reconsidered at the 1996 NEA R.A.</P>
<P> It would seem a conflict of interest for the NEA to represent private school employees considering the harsh view it holds of private schools.  NEA resolutions A27-30 hold that school choice programs  &#147;are deleterious,&#148; and &#147;detrimental to the public interest&#148; because they &#147;could lead to racial, economic, and social isolation of students and could weaken or destroy public education.&#148;</P>
<P> If the NEA/WEA can&#146;t destroy private schools, perhaps they hope to control them by monopolizing the labor force (as it has in public education) as well as increasing their coffers at the same time.</P>

<IMG SRC="head2.gif" WIDTH = 57 HEIGHT = 27><B><I> Restructuring Cuts off Services for Low-Income, Needy Kids </I></B></FONT></H2>
<P> In the Spokane school district, the union and district administration have collaborated to shift $1.5 million in contract funds from direct instructional services for low-income, high need students into WEA-sponsored restructuring organizations.     </P>
<P> An SEA Zone Director and contract negotiator stated that the contract dollars were diverted because the union and district agreed that the restructuring agenda should take priority and that <U>the union didn&#146;t think </U><U>school staff would strike over it</U>.</P>
<P>   TheWEA-sponsored organizations receiving the money  include:  l) the Eastern Washington Restructuring Network, 2) the League of Professional Schools, and 3) the Parent Organizing Project, all of which work to implement the education vision of national labor organizer, Patrick Dolan. </P>
<P> Extracurricular activities as well as  increased special education teachers, therapists and assistants to help regular classroom teachers with high need children integrated into their classrooms were also prioritized lower than the union/district restructuring plan.</P>
<P> Meanwhile,  WEA is facilitating parents and teachers in 19 districts.</P>

<IMG SRC="head2.gif" WIDTH = 57 HEIGHT = 27><B><I> WEA Promotes Prejudice With Members&#146; Dues </I></B></FONT></H2>
<P> According to Resolution I-42, the NEA &#147;deplores prejudice based on race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender, age, disability, marital status &#147; and &#147;rejects the use of names...that promote such prejudice.&#148;  WEA violates this honorable resolution, however, by sponsoring workshops and publications which attack and malign religious people.  In the workshops, &#147;What&#146;s Left After the Right?&#148; and &#147;No Right Turn,&#148; the WEA provides a list of characteristics by which teachers can identify persons who pose a &#147;far right challenge.&#148;  </P>
<P> Some of the characteristics listed in WEA&#146;s &#147;Profile of a Censor&#148; include &#147;good, salt of the earth, concerned parents; absolutist in their beliefs; very frequently members of an ultra-conservative, fundamentalist, charismatic or Pentecostal faith.&#148;   Positions that &#147;censors&#148; hold dear, according to a workshop manual, include traditional family structure, curriculum focused on basic academics,  American patriotism, and pro-life.  </P>
<P> The WEA spent $10,000 for research and publication of Dr. Janet Jones&#146; book, <U>No Right Turn</U>, which outlines strategies to neutralize  &#147;special interests.&#148; It is available only to WEA members  through the WEA.    </P>
<P> At the WEA&#146;s November 1993 Academic Freedom Conference, key-note speaker, Bill Wassmuth, Executive Director of the Northwest Coalition Against Malicious Harassment, labeled &#147;mainstream Christians&#148; as &#147;radical racists and bigots,&#148; stating that &#147;Sunday is the most segregated time of the week.&#148;</P>
<P> The WEA labels former Secretary of Education William Bennett (a pro-life Catholic), former President Ronald Reagan, Dr. James Dobson of Focus on the Family, and the Heritage Foundation (a conservative think tank) as examples of the &#147;righteous, radical, religious right&#148; who pose  threats to public education.  </P>
<P> WEA lists the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), People for the American Way and the NEA as &#147;Friends of Public Education.&#148;   </P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>
<IMG SRC="head2.gif" WIDTH = 57 HEIGHT = 27><B><I> WEA "Loans" Investigated</I></B></FONT>
<P> The last WEA Challenger Network News alerted members to an apparent illegal contribution of members&#146; dues to the WEA-PAC.  Public Disclosure Commission documents revealed that WEA forgave &#147;loans&#148; amounting to $162,255 to WEA-PAC.  ($162,255 is the total amount loaned,  not one of two loans as previously reported). Campaign finance law prohibits use of union dues and agency fees for  hard money political contributions like those  made by PACs.  If WEA diverts dues to the PAC, it is intentionally violating the intent of the law, if not the law itself, by forcing members to contribute to the PAC against their will!</P>
<P> Sedro-Wooley teachers investigated and asked Tom Madden, WEA Uni-Serve Representative, to explain.  Madden denied that WEA forgave loans to the PAC but acknowledged that if it had, it would indeed be a violation of members&#146; rights.</P>
<P> Only when confronted with copies of the PDC documents did Madden acknow-ledge the truth.  He then claimed that the PAC is planning to repay the loan  and WEA is preparing a statement to members.</P>

<IMG SRC="head7.gif" WIDTH = 72 HEIGHT = 30><B> NEA: Corporate Welfare Recipient </B>
<IMG SRC="head7.gif" WIDTH = 72 HEIGHT = 30></FONT></CENTER></P>
<P> With 2.2 million members and an annual revenue of over $785 million, the NEA is the largest and wealthiest union in the United States.   The organization from which the NEA sprang, however, was a small, volun-tary professional teacher&#146;s organization dedicated to advancing education and promoting professional excellence.  In 1907, it was granted property tax exemption status.   </P>
<P> That voluntary teachers&#146; organization is today&#146;s NEA, a leviathan for-profit union which forces dues from teachers in 20 states for the privilege of teaching and for use in its widespread political activity.  </P>
<P> NEA&#146;s headquarters is a lovely, new multi-story office building in the heart of downtown Washington, D.C., with an assessed value of approximately $65 million.  The NEA, however, pays absolutely NO property tax to the District of Columbia, a city which teeters on the brink of social and economic disaster with stratospheric tax rates and schools that rank among the nation&#146;s most dangerous.       Because of the quirk in the 1907 law, the NEA is treated like the Red Cross or the Boy Scouts and is not required to pay property tax.  As such, the NEA greedily feeds at the trough of corporate welfare by contributing no property taxes to support its impoverished community.  Unlike the Red Cross or Boy Scouts, however, the NEA is more political machine than community service organization.  During the 1994 elections, the NEA contributed $4.4 million to political candidates, 98.7% of whom were Democrats.  PAC expenditures are supplemented by spending an additional $300,000 to $400,000 of NEA dues for political communication within the association. Similar activity is funded by WEA members through their compulsory state and local dues.  </P>
<P> For those interested in reading a revealing analysis of teacher unions, NEA and the AFT, <EM><A HREF="../../epi/files/neaftbk/book.htm"> Teacher Unions in Power and Politics</A></EM>, by Haar, Lieberman, and Troy, 1994, presents a thorough examination of the issue.</P>

<IMG SRC="head6.gif" WIDTH = 28 HEIGHT = 27></FONT></CENTER></H6>
<P> We are now organizing for the next state-wide WEA challenge over the use of our dues for objectionable political and ideo-logical activity.   Only those who join the challenge will benefit from a decision.</P>
<P> The previous settlement obtained by 121 education employees for a two-year 50% reduction and refund of dues runs out in June 1996.  Yearly dues run $500-$600.  Our dues refund more than paid for the expense of the fixed fee for our attorneys (who were assisted by National Right To Work Legal Defense Foundation).   </P>
<P> Evidence reveals WEA is increasing rather than decreasing its objectionable political and ideological spending with our dues.  Resigning to become agency shop fee payers and challenging WEA&#146;s spending claims is the only option members have to protect their constitutional right not fund political activity with which they disagree. </P>
<P> <B>If you plan to join the state-wide challenge which is now organizing or are seriously considering it, return </B><B>the form below NOW so that we can keep you informed</B>. (You are not obligated to follow through, but the information is necessary for planning.)  If you have not already subscribed to the newsletter, we will drop your name from the mailing list if we do not hear from you by April 1.  This is so we can most effectively utilize resources.   </P>
<P>  A &#147;Dues Reduction Information Packet&#148; can be obtained for $2.00.   (Based on members&#146; experiences throughout the state, the union repeatedly misleads members who ask about how to exercise their right to pay only for collective bargaining, contract maintenance and grievance procedures.) </P>

<IMG SRC="head9.gif" WIDTH = 56 HEIGHT = 29><B><I> Compulsory WEA Membership?  What are Your Rights? </I></B>
<IMG SRC="head9.gif" WIDTH = 56 HEIGHT = 29></FONT></CENTER></P>
<P> The United States Supreme Court has interpreted the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to <B>guarantee educators and other workers the right to withhold that portion of their union dues which is </B><B>not spent on collective bargaining, grievance procedures and contract maintenance</B> (chargeable activity.)  They also have the <B><U>right to challenge</U></B> the amount that the union claims it spends on chargeable activity in order to receive what they consider a legitimate reduction in dues based on the union&#146;s non-chargeable activity such as political education, training, etc.</P>
<P> <B>Education employees are not required to join the union.  Even in closed shop districts, education </B><B>employees do not have to join the union.</B>  They only have to pay the &#147;agency shop fee&#148; or &#147;fair share&#148; of chargeable activity.  They are not required to pay for non-chargeable activity.  A problem arises with the union&#146;s calculation of the &#147;fair share&#148; because it deceptively categorizes its political expenditures so that the &#147;fair share&#148; is dramatically inflated.  In order for agency shop fee payers to receive a legitimate reduction in dues, they must exercise their right to challenge the amount the union claims is the &#147;fair share.&#148;  <EM>If the agency shop fee payer does not challenge, he/she will continue to pay 100% of union dues</EM></P>
<P> The union is legally required to represent agency shop fee payers the same as members and provide the same benefits, rights, and services stated in the contract.  It cannot discriminate based on membership status.  Agency fee payers cannot participate in union governance (run for office or vote for WEA officers) and they cannot receive strike benefits.  The union drops agency shop fee payers from its liability insurance, but it has not justified how those premiums are not covered by &#147;fair share&#148; fees.  (Similar coverage is available for reasonable rates from independent education associations.)</P>
<P> When inquiring about their rights, many educators have been given inaccurate or incomplete information by union officials.  To obtain your rights, there are certain steps each member must take in order to receive a reduction in dues for objectionable political activity.  </P>
<P><B> </B><B>The WEA Challenger Network will give you the facts!</B></P>

This newsletter is to inform you of your legal rights, </I><I>the union&#146;s documented political spending with our dues, and  other pertinent information for those who believe </I><I>that the union does not legitimately represent their beliefs.  This organization supports union expenditures on </I><I>legitimate union activities for collective bargaining, contract maintenance and improvement of working </I><I>conditions.  We believe union expenditures for political and ideological education and activity on which a </I><I>diverse membership disagrees should not be funded from mandatory dues and agency fees but only by </I><I>voluntary contributions to WEA-PAC.      </I></FONT></P>

<P>1994 state and federal campaign finance reform laws made it illegal for the union to continue to automatically deduct an additional contribution for the WEA-PAC from members&#146; paychecks.  To counteract the new laws, the WEA voted to raise your membership dues by $12 at the 1994 WEA Representative Assembly.  The raise in dues increases the union&#146;s political treasure chest for inside political activity by nearly three quarters of a million dollars in 1994-95 alone!</P>
<P>The union dues which are used to finance political activity such as member and community &#147;education&#148; is called soft money.  While soft money cannot be directly given to campaigns, it is used to sway voters through mailings and TV/ radio ads.  Union dues are  used to pay for lobbyists as well as the publishing or purchasing of materials to increase collection of PAC money.  </P>
<P>PAC contributions are considered hard money which can be given directly to political candidates and ballot measures.  It is illegal to use union dues as hard money political contributions.  Union dues also support &#147;in kind&#148; political spending by providing facilities, vehicles and manpower to candidates and issues&#151; none of which has to be reported.</P>

<P>Using your local, state, and national education association dues for travel, room, board, entertainment, and convention costs, the WEA sent 260 WEA delegates to Minneapolis for the 1995 NEA Representative Assembly this past July.  The union agreed to fund, both with union dues and PAC money, a political agenda which includes the following positions (NEA resolution numbers listed):</P>
<UL>
<LI>Opposition to tax reform which would limit government&#146;s ability to tax and spend. (A-21)
<LI>Opposition to requiring English as the official language of the USA as it will deprive those in need of education, social services, and employment.  (I-47)
<LI>Establishment of sexual orientation education and sensitivity training for education employees; promotion of  October as National Lesbian &amp; Gay History Month.  (B-9)
<LI> Repeal of legislation which permits criticism of public education because it violates both student and teacher rights.  (E-9)
<LI>Establishment of school-based clinics to provide intensive family planning counseling and access to birth control (with  instructions) without parent knowledge/consent. (C-23)
<LI>Opposition to all &#147;deleterious&#148; market-oriented school reform proposals such as privatization, parent choice, vouchers, tax credits and home schooling.  (A-27)
<LI>Taxpayer benefits to illegal aliens.  (A-18)
<LI> Development of educational programs on global warming and ozone depletion.  (B-42)
<LI> Development of instructional programs on nuclear proliferation and strategies/methods to influence national policy to achieve disarmament.  (B-49) 
<LI> Single-payer health care system.  (H-6)
<LI> Abortion on demand.  (I-13)

<P>UniServes are part of the union structure to provide full time bargaining and political action for local associations who do not have enough members to support a full-time union representative. The UniServe staff ties the locals to the NEA&#146;s national political network.</P>

<P>&#147;UniServe staff accords the <U>highest priority</U> to contract language that <U>maximizes the union&#146;s income stream</U>.  In practice, UniServe directors often exercise the leadership in campaigns for or against school board members, state legislators, and other candidates for public office.  By any criterion, they are a crucial component of the NEA&#146;s vast political as well as bargaining operations.&#148; (Excerpt from <I>NEA &amp; AFT </I><I>Teacher Unions in Power and Politics</I>, Haar, Lieberman, and Troy, 1994).</P>
<P>According to Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer, writing in &#147;The National Extortion Association?&#148; Forbes, June 7, 1993, UniServe professionals: </P>

<IMG SRC="head7.gif" WIDTH = 72 HEIGHT = 30></FONT></CENTER></P>
<P>Finding out how the union distributes your annual dues is often an exercise in futility.  For many, the union would not divulge the information until the members formally resigned to become agency shop fee payers.  </P>
<P>Local dues vary greatly in Washington, e.g.,  $15 for Brewster, $251 in South Kitsap.  UniServe council dues also vary, e.g., $53.46 for Rainier UniServe, $106 in Chinook UniServe.  In 1994, WEA collected $251 and the NEA collected $105 annually.  With 62,222 union members in Washington state, the WEA collects nearly $15.5 million dollars per year and funnels close to  $6.5 million additional funds to the NEA.</P>

<IMG SRC="head9.gif" WIDTH = 56 HEIGHT = 29><B><I> State-Wide Challenge to WEA Results in Major Dues Reduction </I></B>
<IMG SRC="head9.gif" WIDTH = 56 HEIGHT = 29></FONT></CENTER></P>
<P>One hundred twenty-one Washington state public education employees challenged the teachers unions in 1994 over what they viewed as the unconstitutional use of their union fees for objectionable political activity.  Before challenging, the employees resigned from the union to become agency shop fee or &#147;fair share&#148; payers.  When the union failed to reduce the fee by an amount that reasonably  reflected the proportion of its non-chargeable activity, the educators threatened to sue.  </P>
<P>On the eve of filing in federal court, the union and teachers agreed on a settlement.  The union offered the group a reduction of 50% in state and national dues for two years along with a 100% reduction in local dues for the first year and 50% reduction in local dues the following year.  The result is a $250-$300 reduction in dues for two years. </P>
<P>While members usually support their locals and, in fact, have worked hard for their locals for years, it is the union itself which jeopardized local association funds.  The WEA offered the reduction in local dues as part of the settlement to stay out of court.  Furthermore, the union forces members to resign in order to exercise their right not to pay for objectionable, non-chargeable activity.  It has been reported by some of the teachers who were part of the challenge that they are voluntarily giving contributions to their locals as a gesture of goodwill.</P>

<P>Growing disillusionment with the teachers unions is fueling a tremendous growth of independent education associations whose members apparently believe that the NEA does not adequately represent them.  Teachers are concerned that they have lost public respect and credibility as education has moved away from professionalism and into unionism.</P>
<P>As stated in the October/November 1994 newsletter of the Association of American Educators, a new coalition of independent education associations is united under the following principles:</P>
<P><B>&#149;</B> <B>That education&#146;s first duty is to the child;</B></P>
<P><B>&#149;</B> <B>That every child has the right to uninterrupted quality education in schools free from strikes or any </B><B>other work stoppage tactics or coercive threats;</B></P>
<P><B>&#149;</B> <B>That educators should be free from all forms of compulsory membership and should not be forced to </B><B>join or otherwise pay dues or fees to a labor union in order to teach or hold membership in the local or </B><B>state association; and</B></P>
<P><B>&#149;</B> <B>That the public schools, their administration, instructional services and curriculum, should be under the </B><B>control and accountable only to the parents, citizens and taxpayers of the communities they serve.  </B></P>

<P>Washington State Representative Grant Pelesky, a school teacher in Puyallup, sponsored HB 1738 which would have required school districts to uniformly inform employees of their union membership options as well as their First Amendment right to not pay for the union&#146;s objectionable political activity.  Several members of the 94-95 WEA challenge testified on the need for uniform notification.  Those testifying shared personal experiences of receiving false and inadequate information from union officials when they inquired about their rights and the amount of dues spent on political activity.  The WEA lobbyist conceded to the Labor and Commerce Committee that although other unions systematically inform  members of their rights, the WEA does not. </P>
<P>The WEA vehemently opposed HB 1738 with all its political clout.  It killed HB 1738 thereby denying Washington State education employees unencumbered access to their constitutional rights. </P>
<P><B><U>Indiana Teachers Freed From Agency Shop Laws</U></B></P>
<P>The Indiana Senate voted in April, 1994, to make it illegal for local school district contracts to include &#147;fair share&#148; provisions.  Because part of their local dues are funnelled to the state and national union (NEA), many Indiana teachers felt that the law unfairly forced them to finance activities they didn&#146;t support and were powerless to stop.  When teachers refused to pay their compulsory union fees, the union sued them.  Very soon, the practice of forcing teachers to pay unions or be sued will be over in Indiana.

<IMG SRC="head9.gif" WIDTH = 56 HEIGHT = 29></FONT></CENTER></P>
<P>The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the First Amendment of the the U.S. Constitution to guarantee educators and other workers the right to withhold that portion of their union dues which is not spent on collective bargaining, grievance procedures and contract maintenance (chargeable activity).  They also have the right to challenge the amount that the union claims it spends on chargeable activity in order to receive a higher reduction in dues than what the union claims goes to non-chargeable activity, such as political education, training, lobbying, etc. </P>
<P><B><U>Education employees are not required to join the union</U></B>.  In closed shop districts, education employees do not have to join the union.  They only have to pay the agency shop fee or &#147;fair share&#148; of  chargeable activity in collective bargaining, etc.  Agency shop fee payers do not pay for non-chargeable activity.  A problem arises with the union&#146;s calculation of the &#147;fair share&#148; because it  deceptively categorizes its political expenditures so that the &#147;fair share&#148; fee is dramatically inflated.  In order for agency shop fee payers to receive a legitimate reduction in dues, they must exercise their right to challenge the amount the union claims is the &#147;fair share.&#148;  <B><I>If the agency shop fee payer does not challenge, he/she will continue to pay </I></B><B><I>100% of the union dues.</I></B></P>
<P>The union must represent agency shop fee payers the same as members and provide the same rights, benefits, and services stated in the contract.  The union cannot discriminate based on membership status.  Agency fee payers  cannot participate in union governance (run for office or vote for office holders) and they cannot receive strike benefits.  The union drops agency shop fee payers from its liability insurance, but it has not justified how those premiums are not covered by &#147;fair share&#148; fees.  (Similar liability insurance is available at reasonable rates from independent education associations.)  </P>
<P>When inquiring about their rights, many educators have been given inaccurate or incomplete information by union officials.  To obtain your rights, there are certain steps you must take in order to receive a reduction in dues for the amount spent on objectionable political activity.</P>
<P><B>The WEA Challenger Network will give you the facts. </B></P>

<P>
This packet contains information on the two-step process you must complete in order to exercise your constitutional right not to pay for the National Education Association and its state and local affiliatesí political and ideological activity.  As more people exercise the legal option of paying only for the portion of dues spent on collective bargaining, contract administration and enforcement, and the improvement of working conditions (chargeable union activity), we hope that the education association will concentrate on representing members rather than pursuing controversial and non-education political agendas (nonchargeable union activity).  Please review the enclosed information carefully.  There are deadlines you must meet in order to receive your dues reduction!    Depending on the state, there may be variations to this information.

<CENTER><STRONG><H2>OBTAINING YOUR RIGHTS</H2></STRONG></CENTER>
<P>
<U><H4><STRONG>Step One:  Resignation From Union  </STRONG></H4></U>
<P>
You must resign from the education association and notify it of your intention to become an agency shop fee payer.  You need to  complete and submit the Agency Shop Employee Form by August 31, 199_, to your local education association.  (Ask your union what the deadline is and  if you can get an extension to the deadline if it has passed.  In the past, challengers were given some extensions.  Many state education associations have a toll-free number.  Ask for the office of the education associationís attorney.) Send a copy to the state education association as well.  Send all correspondence by registered mail and keep copies of everything you send.  Document all verbal communication as well.  A sample resignation form follows.  Double check to see if your education association requires a specific form.   
<P>
<U><H4><STRONG>Step Two:  Objection/Challenge to Use of Dues (Hudson Packet Response)</STRONG></H4></U>
<P>
After you resign from the union, the state education association will send you a ìHudson Packet.î  (ìHudsonî refers to the Supreme Court ruling which established the First Amendment right of teachers not to pay for the unionís political activity.)   Based on past experience, you will receive a six-page letter to ìCertificated and AHE Agency Fee Payersî in a packet of information about l/2 inch thick.  This letter will state that you have three options as an agency fee payer:   
<P>
1. you may pay the full amount of dues paid by education association members; <P>
2. you may object to the use of your agency fee for nonchargeable activities and accept what the education association offers for a reduction; or,<p>
3.  you may object to the use of your agency fee for nonchargeable political activity,  and challenge the education associationís calculation of the amount it spends on such activity--claiming, in effect, that it spends more on political activity than it concedes.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><STRONG>    *****  To receive the maximum reduction in dues you must exercise option three.  *****</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>
A sample objection/challenge letter follows.  However, be sure to double-check the Hudson Packet letter to make sure you have included all the required information.   Check the date this letter is due.  If not sent in on time you may end up waiving your right to object!  Keep a copy and send one to your school district payroll office.  Note the date you sent it to your state education association.  If you do not choose to join a group legal challenge, the American Arbitration Association will determine the amount of your dues reduction (usually 11-20% of yearly dues).  You have to go through this process each and every year unless you join a group legal challenge which may result in a more substantial dues reduction for several years.
 <P>
<P>
<CENTER><STRONG><H3>EXPLANATION OF YOUR RIGHTS  TO WITHHOLD TEACHER UNION DUES <P>
FOR POLITICAL ACTIVITY</H3></STRONG></CENTER>
<P>
To receive a reduction in your dues so that you only pay for legitimate, chargeable union activity, you must resign from the education association to become an agency shop fee payer.  Agency shop fee payers pay for union representation in collective bargaining, contract administration and enforcement, and the improvement in working conditions.  The education association is legally obligated to provide the SAME representation in these matters for members and agency fee payers, alike.  Agency fee payers continue to receive health insurance and pension benefits.   All benefits set forth in your collectively bargained contract are retained when you become an agency shop fee payer. <P>
<P>
An ìagency shop fee payerî loses certain education association membership benefits, i.e., an agency fee payer may not run for union office or vote in elections; an agency fee payer does not have access to discount legal services offered through the education association; an agency fee payer does not receive the education associationís liability insurance coverage. (For those who wish to obtain comparable liability insurance, the Association of American Educators is a new professional teachers' organization focusing on academics and character education.  AAE members may obtain a $1 million liability insurance policy as part of their membership.  AAEís toll-free number is (800) 704-7799).<P>
<P>
Because of the unified status of the local, state, and National Education Associations, you do not have the option of retaining membership in your local education association while resigning from the state education association and National Education Association.  The teachers' union requires that you either belong to all or none of the education association affiliates.<P>
  <P>
The 121 Washington State teachers who challenged the Washington Education Association in 1994 and received an out-of-court settlement had hired two attorneys to represent them in a state-wide challenge effort.  On the attorneysí advice, the challenge was not submitted to arbitration because the American Arbitration Association has historically ruled in favor of the union. While you do not need an attorney to receive some reduction in dues, the WEA Challengers believe their attorneys maximized the amount of the dues reduction.  The attorneys, who were assisted by the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation (l (800) 336-3600), negotiated an out-of-court settlement for a 50% reduction in all dues for the 94-95 and 95-96 school years, including a 100% reduction in local dues for 94-95.  The education association agreed to refund each challenger $200-$300 per year for overcharging of agency shop fees. <P>
<P>
Because of the large group, the attorneys for the WEA Challengers offered an affordable fixed fee for representation in the challenge. Another legal challenge to the Washington Education Association is planned for the Spring of 1996 as the previous settlement expires in June 1996.  <P>
<P>
When you exercise your rights,  your local education association may be annoyed because it will have to account for its expenditures to the arbitration board.

The Washington Education Association Challengers of 1994 were largely treated respectfully when they explained to their colleagues that they believe in paying their fair share for collective bargaining and other legitimate union activity, but they did not want to fund the promotion of political activities to which they object. It is your constitutional right to challenge the unionís calculation of the agency shop fee to insure that you receive a legitimate reduction in dues.<P>

<P>
In Washington State we are publishing a newsletter, ìThe WEA Challenger Network News,î to  inform members of their rights as well as expose the unionís political activity and its questionable expenditures.  Information will also be shared about joining future state-wide legal challenges.  Watch this web site for future issues.<P>
<P>
Information is power.  The WEA Challenger Network News is designed to inform and empower education employees to exercise their constitutional right to protect their freedom of speech by not paying for the education associationís promotion of political ideas with which they disagree.  Consider starting a newsletter in your state!<P>
<P>
Because the union has strayed so far from its mission, educators, by association, have lost credibility and respect. We hope this grassroots effort will shift the union back to its legitimate mission. <P>
<P>
Join the growing number of educators who are standing up for their rights and convictions.  
Together we will make a difference!<P>

	<TD WIDTH=70%>The Dallas Children&#146;s Education Fund has completed its second year of providing educational opportunity to Dallas area children.  When the last school  bell rang in May, the CEF was helping 235 children attend schools their parents selected.  This is more than twice the number of children the CEF was able to assist in its inaugural year.  This success would not be possible without support from Dallas area businesses, foundations and community leaders.  Thanks to their support the Dallas tuition assistance program is in the top ten of all such programs nationwide.  </P>

<P>Despite this success, there are 209 children who applied for tuition assistance but have yet to be served due to a lack of funding.  And more families continue to learn about the CEF.  Almost every day hopeful parents call to ask the CEF for help in placing  their child in a school they have selected.  Unfortunately, until more funds become available, these families will have to wait to enroll their child in the school they prefer. </P>
<P>CEF scholarships are opening doors for Dallas area children and providing hope and self determination to their families.</P>

<IMG SRC="../gifs/7-96-1.gif" ALT="Art by Danielle" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=111 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT">
<P>The Children&#146;s Education Fund is a  privately funded scholarship plan providing tuition assistance to low-income children in Dallas County. The CEF pays half of tuition (up to $1,000) to schools these families select for their children.  </P>
<P>To be eligible for CEF scholarships, children must be in grades K-8, attend a public school in Dallas County, and qualify for the federal school lunch program.  Tuition assistance will provided to all accepted applicants as long as funding is available.  Currently there is a waiting list of 209 children who have applied for scholarships but have yet to receive funding.  </P>
<P>The CEF was organized in August 1994 to give low-income families a voice in their children&#146;s education.  It is the CEF&#146;s goal to provide hundreds of Dallas area children the opportunity to attend the school their parents believe is best for them.</P>

<IMG SRC="../gifs/7-96-2.gif" ALT="Art by Chaz Albert" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN="RIGHT">
<P>The Today Foundation, the parent organization of the CEF, has recognized five public schools for their innovation and hard work.  The Innovative Public School award was presented to schools or districts where grass roots efforts improved education or solved difficult problems.  Each winner received a certificate and a cash award of $1,000.  The winners are:</P>
<P>1. <B>Allison Elementary School - Austin ISD.</B>  </P>
<P>A group of teachers organized the Early Bird Reading Club to address poor reading skills as well as the problems of students arriving early.  Often, these working parents had no choice but to drop their kids off at school before the doors opened.  The school responded by starting a reading club open to all students before regular school hours.  With the club in place, Allison Elementary has in effect added precious reading time to the school day.  In the meantime, students have become hooked on reading! State Representative Glen Maxey presented the award. </P>
<P>2. <B>Lazbuddie High School - Lazbuddie ISD.</B>  </P>
<P>Although academics should be the number one priority at every school, all too often athletics come first.  Lazbuddie High School started an organization called CLASS to recognize high achieving students in academics. More than a program, CLASS is school-wide effort to make scholastics a priority.</P>
<P>As a result of CLASS, the school became the Regional Literary Champion, and by 1993 Lazbuddie was the Runner-Up State Champion.  The school has had the State Champion Accounting Team and Computer Team for the last three years.  Prior to CLASS, the school entered only four students in UIL competitions.  Over the last two years, students have earned more than $165,000 in scholarships and this year they have already earned $127,000. These are excellent results for a graduating class of 28. House Speaker Pete Laney presented the award.</P>
<P>3. <B>Pearsall Summer Youth Program - Pearsall ISD</B></P>
<P>A major problem in the city was increasing gang membership and an influx of drugs from nearby Mexico.  The problem was exacerbated in the summer months when young people were left unsupervised.  To address these problems, a cross section of the community including ministers, school officials, probation officers and police created the Pearsall Summer Youth Program.  The program takes advantage of resources already existing in the community, such as the library, churches and schools, and serves students from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. 6 days a week. The summer program provides a variety of activities, including classroom instruction.  Last summer participation was high, crime was down and attention to academics was up. State Representative Tracy King will present the award.</P>
<P>4. <B>Coyote Club, Carl Schurz Elementary - New Braunfels ISD</B></P>
<P>When a school  teacher began coaching kids who could not afford to participate in Little League baseball he soon discovered the boys needed to learn more than how to swing a bat.  Soon Craig Head began &#147;coaching&#148; these children in academics after school as well.   Eventually Craig and his wife Vicky began to regularly help a group of boys in grades 4-8 with homework in addition to providing them with equipment to play sports.  This shoe string operation  has grown so much that the local Chamber of Commerce is taking over the program four days each week.</P>
<P>Representative Ed Kuempel presented the award.</P>
<P>5. <B>Puppy P.A.W.S. Child Development Center - Bosqueville ISD (Waco)</B></P>
<P>This program is the brain-child of a Home Economics teacher who saw the need for more child care facilities as well as more opportunities in vocational education.  The result is pre-school open to the community that also serves as a lab for students who want to pursue a career in early childhood development.</P>
<P>The Center provides a preschool program for all students regardless of income or disability. The opening of the Center coincided with student training in the area of Early Childhood Professions.  It was offered as an elective to juniors and seniors in high school.  Students who receive credit in the class can continue the program at the local college.</P>
<P>This is truly an innovative way to meet the demand for day care and provide useful vocational training to high school students.</P>
<P>State Representative Kip Averitt presented the award.</P>
<P>The Today Foundation is proud to honor schools which have taken it upon themselves to make their campuses work better for their children.</P>

<IMG SRC="apple3.gif" WIDTH = 14 HEIGHT = 15>Despite recurring bond issues, facilities are already in place for Texas size influx of students</A></H4>
<P>According to recent statistics, there are 342,387 churches in the United States.  That means a huge inventory of facilities are already in place in America&#146;s neighborhoods, much of which is unused during the week.  Only about 6% of these churches operate a school.   </P>
<P>This unused capacity could come in handy for those wanting to open private schools or charter schools in their own neighborhood.  If only half of churches not operating schools allotted space for a single classroom of 22 students, America could immediately serve an additional 3.5 million  school children.  That is enough capacity to seat 90% of all public school children in Texas.</P>
<P>Encouraging private alternatives would reduce the need for new school bond issues. Long term school debt in Texas was equal to $2,465 per student in the 1994-95 school year.  Each use of a private facility already in place is a break for the property tax payer.  </P>
<P>The total property tax levy in Texas has increased from $3.6 billion in 1984 to $9.0 billion in 1995.</P>
<H4><A ID="I8" NAME="I8">
<IMG SRC="apple3.gif" WIDTH = 14 HEIGHT = 15> New charter schools achieve goal of offering variety of educational settings</A></H4>
<P>The State Board of Education has approved 20 Open Enrollment charter schools, the maximum allowed under the new legislation authorizing these new kinds of public schools. There were at least 14 schools competing for the final four slots.</P>
<P>Under the law, charter schools are allowed to be managed at the campus level.  Charter schools can be authorized by the local school district (local charters) or by the state (Open Enrollment).</P>
<P>A review of the approved charter applications reveals that there is no &#147;one-way&#148; to run a school.  A brief review of some the new schools opening in Texas follows:</P>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/7-96-5.gif" width=300 Align="right" Alt="Hi my name is Latressa Johnson. I want to thank you for the tuition assistance through the Chidren's Education Fund. With your help, I can reach my goal. Because the sky is the limit!">
<P>George I. Sanchez Charter School -Houston.  Will serve 300 students in grades 9-12 in an area where 80 percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced lunch, and where 50 percent of ninth graders drop out before graduating.</P>
<P>Raul Yzaquirre&#146;s School for Success - Houston. Students in grades 7 and 8 will be taught in one classroom rather than changing classes several times each day.  A minimum of 90 minutes each day will be spent on reading, language arts and grammar.  Community members will serve as mentors for students.</P>
<P>One-Stop Multi-service Charter School - Mission.  The school is for children in grades 7-12  who will be referred to the school through the local juvenile probation system.</P>
<P>Academy of Transitional Studies - Corpus Christi.  Students will include high school students who are discipline problems and are behind academically.</P>
<P>Girls and Boys Prep School - Houston.  Boys and girls will be taught in separate classrooms and there will be no competitive sports with outside campuses.  Academic courses will allow for competition in debate, journalism, dance, theater and arts.</P>
<P>Genesis Charter High School - Dallas. In addition to their studies, students will have to complete 100 hours of community service.</P>
<P>The Today Foundation has plans to work closely with charters as they become an important facet of public education in Texas.</P>

<IMG SRC="apple3.gif" WIDTH = 14 HEIGHT = 15> Privately funded scholarships making a difference</A></H4>
<P>The Educational Choice Charitable Trust in Indianapolis was the first privately funded scholarship program in the nation.  The program was founded in 1991 and served as the inspiration for similar programs, including the CEF.</P>
<P>The Hudson Institute has performed research on students participating in the ECCT program, and has also gathered information on students who applied for ECCT assistance but remained on waiting lists due to funding constraints.</P>
<P>Among the findings:</P>
<P>Ninety percent of parents who moved their children to a private school with help from ECCT reported they were satisfied or very satisfied.</P>
<P>Parents ranked safety as the most important factor in moving their child to a new school.</P>
<P>As in all privately funded scholarship plans, there are instances where families drop out of the program for financial reasons.  However, the Hudson study revealed that families in the lowest income bracket are no more likely to leave the program than other families.  (Our own interpretation of this data is that the real heroes in America are these determined parents struggling to help their children get a better education.) </P>
<P>It also appears single mothers are no more likely to leave the program than two-parent families.</P>
<P>Although families with the lowest incomes are no more likely to leave the Indianapolis scholarship program, financial pressure is by far the most common reason for any parent to remove their child from the program.</P>
<P>An analysis of test scores from Indianapolis public schools and children who had taken advantage of the ECCT program revealed that the choice students in the critical grades 6-8 did not experience a severe drop in test scores like their public school counterparts  (including those who had applied for ECCT assistance, but remained on waiting lists).</P>

<P>Based on its enrollment of 14,000 students, the  Dallas Diocese is as large as many school districts in Texas. Despite its size, this private school system operates with little overhead, saving the Diocese precious dollars and keeping tuition low for area families.</P>
<P>Because local Catholic schools are managed at the campus level,  only five full-time administrators  are needed in the central office.  Additional office help includes three consultants and three secretaries, one of whom works part time. That is, there are 0.57 central office employees for every 1,000 Catholic school students, vs. about 1.2 central office professionals in the local public school district. </P>
<P>This efficiency is one reason why the Diocese can educate one of its students for about $2,500 vs. a cost of about $4,650 in the Dallas Independent School District. </P>
<P>(The $2,500 figure is actual cost. Tuition charges are generally lower.)</P>

<P>Thanks to the generosity of the Dallas community, 235 low-income children are attending schools their parents selected as best for them.  This is more than twice the number of students enrolled with help from the CEF a year ago.  Although this only its second year of operations, the CEF ranks in the Top Ten of all privately funded scholarship programs in the United States.</P>
<P>The CEF pays half of the tuition (up to $1,000) to schools families choose for their children. To be eligible for CEF scholarships, children must be entering grades K-8, attend a public school in Dallas County, and qualify for the federal lunch program. </P>
<P>As of January, the CEF was helping 176 families achieve their educational goals for their children.  One-third of these families were single-parent households.</P>
<P>Although the CEF serves 235 children, there are 160 children who have applied for scholarships but are awaiting funding to become available.  </P>
<P>CEF scholarships are providing hope, self-determination and opportunity to children across Dallas County.</P>

<IMG SRC="apple3.gif" WIDTH = 14 HEIGHT = 15><B><I> </I></B><B><I>CEF proud to be part of a national growing industry</I></B></A></H4>
<P>There are 22 programs like the CEF nationwide.  Each of these organizations helps low-income families send their children to schools they have selected.  These programs are providing tuition assistance to 10,000 children .  More than 17,000 children are on waiting lists.  Eight additional scholarship programs are scheduled to open in 1996.  The Dallas CEF ranks 7th nationally in terms of students served.  Each of these privately funded organizations have formed since 1991.</P>

<P>The Today Foundation  (the parent organization of the Children&#146;s Education Fund) will recognize Texas&#146; most innovative public schools this spring with a cash award.  The Innovative Public School Award will be presented to the five schools, programs or districts which have solved difficult problems at the local level.  These schools may have found ways to stretch finances, improve discipline or make children better readers. The purpose of the cash ward of $1,000 is to honor these innovative campuses and communities which have taken it upon themselves to make their schools work better for their children.</P>

<P>Students are the stars in the CEF&#146;s first video soon to be released.  The video, which describes the county-wide scholarship program, will explain how the CEF is changing lives right here in Dallas County.</P>
<P>In the video CEF chairman Richard H. Collins and national business leaders review the need for CEF and the importance of providing low-income families the chance to select their children&#146;s schools.  But it is the families themselves who steal the show.  Each CEF family has a story to tell as to why their children are attending schools they selected.  CEF kids talk about their new schools, the CEF and themselves.</P>
<P>If you or your organization would like to order the CEF video, call the CEF at 214 298-1811 or write to P.O. Box 225748, Dallas, Texas 75222-5748.</P>

<P>Sherman, Charles and Emond are seventh graders at St. Anthony School in South Dallas.  It is their first year to attend a private school, and they are making the adjustment well.  Emond notes that classes are smaller at St. Anthony than at his old school.</P>
<P>Charles&#146; favorite subject is Language Arts.  He hopes to use these skills to become a lawyer.  Being a lawyer, Charles said, will allow him to help his community and his family.  He also thinks the money would be nice.  Charles said his family sent him to St. Anthony to &#147;get an education.&#148;</P>
<P>Sherman is also community -minded.  He wants to be a policeman.  Sherman wants to be able to take care of his family and protect his friends.  He also wants to &#147;make some good money.&#148;  According to Sherman the teachers at St. Anthony take more time with him in class and give him more work to do.  His favorite subject is math.  Sherman likes to play basketball and his favorite player is Shaq O&#146;Neal.</P>
<P>Emond&#146;s family believes trouble is less likely to find him at St. Anthony.  He likes basketball and football and favorite player is Michael Irvin.  </P>

<P>St. Anthony School is a 50-year-old Catholic school in South Dallas serving primarily African-American children.  It is one of eight inner city schools of the 41 in the Dallas Diocese.  About 220 students attend St. Anthony, almost all of them non-Catholic.  Children come to the school from as far away as Richardson.  After almost closing its doors in the late 1980s, St. Anthony has reached maximum enrollment and is completing a new gymnasium.  The school is an asset to its community and the city of Dallas.</P>

<IMG SRC="apple3.gif" WIDTH = 14 HEIGHT = 15><B><I> </I></B><B><I>Recent Justice Department study links crime to illiteracy</I></B></A></H4>
<P>A recent study by the Justice Department concludes that there is a strong link between crime and illiteracy, calling the inability of young people to read &#147;a major cause of delinquency.&#148; The study is supported by other research findings which were published in the Jan. 12 issue of the <I>Investor&#146;s Business Daily</I>.</P>
<P>The research reveals that 68 percent of those arrested are unable to read, and that three in five prison inmates are illiterate.</P>
<P>Furthermore, 75 percent of those on welfare are illiterate, as are 85 percent of unwed mothers.</P>
<P>Aside from the cost of wasted and frustrated lives, transfer payments made to functionally illiterate adults cost Americans $224 billion.  Big business spends more than $300 million annually in remedial training.</P>
<P>These findings are of grave concern because the trend toward illiteracy continues.  America&#146;s <I>literacy</I> rate, which was 97 percent in 1950, is only 80 percent today.  According to the national Adult Literacy survey performed in 1993, half of American adults are functionally illiterate.</P>
<P>According to Michael Brunner, author of the Justice Department study, the link between crime and illiteracy is too strong to ignore.  Brunner concludes it is &#147;staggering&#148; that many of today&#146;s schools are failing to produce &#147;civilized students.&#148;</P>
<H4><A ID="I11" NAME="I11">
<IMG SRC="apple3.gif" WIDTH = 14 HEIGHT = 15><B><I> </I></B><B><I>State Board grants charter school</I></B></A></H4>
<P>The CEF commends the State Board of Education for granting the first charter school under Texas&#146; new education law.  The school, Renaissance Charter School of Irving, will provide academic and vocational skills to students in grades 7-12.  Initially, 280 students are expected to enroll in the Renaissance School in grades 8-10.  Enrollment is projected to ultimately reach 560.</P>
<P>On Feb. 16 the State Board approved the Renaissance School&#146;s application for an Open Enrollment Charter.  Under such a charter a school remains a public school but operates independently of any school district.  These schools are funded at the same per-student allotment as traditional public schools, but Open Enrollment schools can attract students from any  district.</P>
<P>CEF executives have worked with the charter&#146;s organizers for more than a year.</P>
<P>Don Jones, an Irving school teacher, is chairman of the steering committee for the Renaissance School.  Mr. Jones said the school will cater to average and above average students, many of whom will not be on a track to attend a four-year college upon graduation.</P>
<P>&#147;We want to ensure we break the cycle of poverty in which many of our students find themselves,,&#148; Mr. Jones said.</P>
<P>Mr. Jones and school organizers developed a business plan for the new school, secured facilities, enrolled students, and initiated partnerships with several area businesses.  The school initially tried to obtain a &#147;local charter&#148; (as described under the new law) from the Irving school district, but was denied.</P>
<P>As an Open Enrollment charter school, the district will have no authority over Renaissance.</P>
<P>Michael Williams, a member of the CEF&#146;s advisory board, testified in favor the Renaissance School at a sub-committee hearing of the State Board.  Mr. Williams is a Fort Worth attorney who practices school law, and is a former Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education.</P>
<P>The State Board also approved five other charters during its Feb. 16 meeting.  Current law limits the number of Open Enrollment Charters to 20.</P>
<P>&#147;These are exciting times for Texas children&#148; CEF Chairman Richard H. Collins said.  &#147;Charter schools and CEF scholarships put children first.  These opportunities boost self-determination of families, enhance opportunities and provide hope to children in our community, Mr. Collins said.</P>

<IMG SRC="apple3.gif" WIDTH = 14 HEIGHT = 15><B><I> </I></B><B><I>Parents rank safety as primary concern</I></B></A></H4>
<P>Safety is the number one reason parents are opting out of the school system.  According to the Parents Union of Texas, fear of violence is the most frequent reason parents give for removing their children from public schools.  Drugs and low moral standards rank second.  (The Parents Union is an organization devoted to families who home school their children.)</P>
<P>CEF parents often tell us that concerns over safety prompted them to select a school for their children other than the one assigned them.  One student, Wendi, was afraid to tell school officials she was being harassed by gang members for fear of retribution. Her family could not afford to move to another attendance zone.  Fortunately, CEF was able to provide Wendi a scholarship.  Today she attends a school that is a comfort to her and her parents.</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Dallas Children's Education Fund (CEF) was organized
in August 1994 to give low income families a voice in the education
of their children.  The CEF provides tuition assistance to help
these families send their children to schools they select.  The
CEF pays half of the tuition to these schools, up to $1,000 annually.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Thanks to support from area business and community
leaders, the CEF is bringing self-determination and hope to needy
families across Dallas County.  It is our goal to provide such
opportunity to thousands of children right here in our community.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is an investment that will yield returns for generations.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><IMG SRC="gifs/apple2.gif" border=0> <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#FF0000">Our Mission...<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To expand educational opportunity for economically
disadvantaged children in Dallas County, to provide a brighter
future for themselves, their families and their communities.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><IMG SRC="gifs/apple2.gif" border=0> <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#FF0000">Easy as A,B,C<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The CEF is a simple but powerful program.  Each month
we pay half of the tuition for each CEF student to the school
selected by their parents. Qualified applicants must:  1. Be transferring
from a public school in Dallas County. 2. Be entering grades K-8.
3. Qualify as low income as defined by Federal School Lunch Program
guidelines. Tuition assistance in the form of a &quot;scholarship&quot;
is awarded on a first-come first-served basis of up to $1,000
annually.  Parents must pay the remainder of the tuition or secure
financial aid for their portion.   Once a child is accepted in
the program, the CEF makes a 3-year commitment to provide tuition
assistance.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><IMG SRC="gifs/apple2.gif" border=0> <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#FF0000">Success story<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the fall of 1996, more than 300 students were
enrolled in schools their parents selected with help from the
CEF.  This is a 33% increase over enrollment of the prior year.
 Thanks to support from area business and community leaders, the
Dallas CEF has become one of the largest of the more than 30 privately
funded tuition assistance programs in the country.  It is the
goal of the CEF to expand the program many times over to help
economically disadvantaged children in Dallas County.  With continued
support, the CEF can achieve that goal.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><IMG SRC="gifs/apple2.gif" border=0> <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#FF0000">Opening doors, brightening futures<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Children are most likely to succeed in schools where
parents are involved in the education of their own children. 
Children benefit most when the school acts and feels like a community,
where discipline is appropriate and curriculum challenging.  Many
schools possess these ingredients for success. Unfortunately,
many low income families have no recourse if their children attend
schools where such ingredients are lacking. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 >It is the goal of the CEF to offer each one of these
children the opportunity for excellence.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><IMG SRC="gifs/apple2.gif" border=0> <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#FF0000">Early excellence lasts a lifetime<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Tuition assistance and scholarships are traditionally
reserved for the college level, but the early years are the most
important of a child's education.  A quality education can break
the cycle of poverty, but scholarships to prestigious universities
are of no help to children who are shortchanged early in their
academic careers.  Children who are poor readers and deficient
in math at the elementary level have little chance of realizing
their potential.  The CEF believes every child should have the
chance to succeed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><IMG SRC="gifs/apple2.gif" border=0> <FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#FF0000">Return on investment<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Investing in the CEF is an investment in the future.
  Each dollar raised by CEF goes directly toward tuition assistance.
 For each $1,000 contributed another economically disadvantaged
child is able to attend a school his parents select.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CEF students attend more than 35 area schools. These
schools vary widely but have one thing in common: CEF parents
have chosen them because they believe they will provide a quality
education for  their children. Many wealthier parents have already
made such a choice - by moving to a new neighborhood or  paying
the full tuition to a private school.  The CEF wants those with
more limited opportunities to finally have a voice in their own
children's education.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>An investment in our children is an investment in
our greatest natural resource.<BR>

This chapter is devoted to educational reform strategy and tactics
relating to the National Education Association (NEA) and the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT), the nation's largest teacher unions.
As is now widely recognized, the teacher unions are the major
obstacle to market oriented educational reforms, such as school
choice or contracting out instruction to the private sector. They
are also the main opposition to lowering the age of compulsory
schooling, home schooling, or other reforms that would shrink
the market for public education.
<P>
Essentially, I will argue that it is now feasible to eliminate
NEA/AFT veto power over state educational policy. This objective
can be achieved in a few years, even without repeal of the state
bargaining laws which have been the foundation of teacher union
membership, revenues, and political power in most states. Although
such laws should be repealed, I shall not argue that case here.
Instead, my argument is that legislative changes in the nonbargaining
states and amendments to the bargaining laws in ways that are
thoroughly justified on public policy grounds, apart from their
implications for union political influence, will suffice. Indeed,
in some cases, the amendments proposed would merely apply the
safeguards for union members under the National Labor Relations
Act (NLRA) to state bargaining statutes which govern school district
labor relations. Partly for this reason, the changes cannot reasonably
be characterized as &quot;extremist&quot; or some such pejorative
that suggests a narrow ideological approach to the issues of union
power.
<H3><A NAME="Introduction_The_Growth_of_Teacher"></A>Introduction:
The Growth of Teacher Collective Bargaining </H3>

<P>
At the outset, let me emphasize my conviction that public employees
should be represented by organizations that can articulate their
interests and that can oppose government as the need arises. In
totalitarian societies, individuals are helpless against government.
They are helpless because the organizations that represent them
are dominated by their employer, that is, by government. This
was the situation that prevailed in public education in the pre-bargaining
era. Collective bargaining and unionization have solved that problem,
but unfortunately at the cost of creating several others that
are much more destructive of good education and a free society.
In this connection, it should be noted that collective bargaining
in education emerged and expanded rapidly from 1960 to 1990, a
period in which unionization and collective bargaining in the
private sector declined precipitously. In the 1960s, private sector
unions like the United Auto Workers (UAW) provided critical assistance
to the fledgling teacher unions; today, the private sector unions
are appealing to the NEA and AFT for help, alleging that the decline
of the teacher unions is inevitable if they do not assist their
brothers and sisters in the private sector. Although union leaders
attribute the private sector decline to union busting employers,
the reality is that private sector unions have been declining
in all Western industrial nations. It is indeed ironic that the
private sector unions, not market oriented educational reformers,
should be emphasizing the decline of private sector unions at
NEA and AFT conventions.
<P>
To avoid any illusions on the subject, a basic feature of unions
should be noted. Unions exist by controlling wage rates and other
terms and conditions of employment. If teachers need not conform
to the union negotiated contract, their union could not survive
qua union; the union's right to serve as the exclusive representative
of employees in a bargaining unit is essential to viability as
a union. This is a factual statement that is accepted by labor
economists of all political persuasions. Of course, the unions
do not always negotiate terms and conditions of employment for
all workers in a particular industry; in some industries, union
and non-union companies do exist. In such cases, however, and
education is one of them, the unions seek to expand their jurisdiction
over non-union enterprise either by seeking prohibitions against
contracting out or by organizing the non-union workers or by seeking
to reduce the viability of non-union enterprise by whatever means
are available.
<P>
Needless to say, the NEA and AFT are well aware of the fact that
although producer competition may be good for consumers, it also
leads to a shrinking union movement. Inasmuch as the NEA and AFT
employ thousands of highly paid full-time staff, they try to eliminate
producer competition in any way they can. They would hardly be
unions if this were not the case.
<P>
In education, union efforts to stifle producer competition take
many forms:
<UL>
<LI>Requiring all teachers, including teachers in private schools
and home school parents, to be certified.
<LI>Limitations on school board authority to contract out services,
both instructional and non-instructional.
<LI>Collective bargaining contracts which require school boards
to employ teachers and support personnel at negotiated wage rates.
<LI>All out opposition to any legislation, no matter how small
the scale, which could provide vouchers or tuition tax credits
to parents who wish to enroll their children in private schools.
</UL>

<P>
Notwithstanding the inherent conflict between unionization and
competition, conservatives who detest the NEA often view the AFT
and AFT President Albert Shanker in a more positive light. Actually,
during the 1970s when Shanker was president of New York City's
United Federation of Teachers, the union physically sabotaged
an Office of Economic Opportunity experiment in contracting out
instruction. More recently, however, Shanker has been light years
ahead of NEA leaders in blocking market oriented reforms that
jeopardize union power or might lead to this outcome. Thus while
the NEA asserts &quot;We will never accept privatization,&quot;
the AFT says &quot;We'll consider it on the merits&quot; - but
never seems to identify a case in which the merits justify privatization.
Ironically, both unions contract out needed services when they
act as employers; although the NEA employs a staff of full-time
lawyers, perhaps its most influential official is Robert H. Chanin,
its general counsel who provides legal services to the NEA as
an independent contractor.
<P>
At any rate, insofar as market oriented reforms are concerned,
the only differences between the NEA and AFT are in the effectiveness
of their opposition, not their basic hostility to any and all
such reforms. Additional evidence on this is the fact that despite
their differences in leadership, personnel and governance structure,
the NEA and AFT overwhelmingly support the same candidates for
public office and the same policies with respect to school choice
and privatization. To my knowledge, no one has ever suggested
that union differences on these matters does or would jeopardize
their probable merger in the next two years.
<P>
NEA/AFT concurrence on candidates for political office underscores
the fact that the teacher unions are a major constituency of the
Democratic Party. Approximately one of every eight delegates to
the 1992 Democratic National Convention was a member of the NEA
or AFT. Both unions contributed heavily in both cash and in-kind
contributions to the Clinton campaign and to Democratic candidates
for state and federal office. For example, NEA-PAC endorsed 39
candidates for the U.S. Senate in 1992; only one, Arlen Specter
of Pennsylvania was a Republican. Specter received $2,000 in the
Republican primary but Lynn Yeakel received $5,000 in the Democratic
primary and $5,000 in the general election against Specter. This
is typical of the NEA's &quot;bipartisan&quot; approach to politics.
<P>
Several case studies underscore the fact that the NEA and AFT
state affiliates play a critical role in state politics; one recent
publication documents their influential role in such diverse states
as New York, California, and Alabama; it would only belabor the
obvious to cite additional chapter and verse on this issue.1
<H3><A NAME="Teacher_Union_Resources"></A>Teacher Union Resources
</H3>

<P>
To fully appreciate the role of the NEA and AFT in the American
political scene, it is essential to understand the resources they
bring to bear in political affairs.
<P>
The unions do not reveal their total income, nor are they required
to do so by federal or state law. Teacher unions that represent
some private sector employees must report their total revenues
to the Department of Labor on Form LM-2, but &quot;total revenues&quot;
does not include several off budget operations, such as political
action committee (PAC) funds; the latter are regulated, by different
agencies with different reporting schedules and requirements.
Consequently, it is virtually impossible to obtain a comprehensive
summary of NEA/AFT financial operations. Not surprisingly, the
unions are not forthcoming on the subject when disclosure is not
legally required. One recent estimate concludes that their total
annual revenues (local, state, federal, and overseas affiliates)
are close to a billion dollars annually.2 In this connection,
it should be noted that the NEA and AFT national offices received
about $250 million in 1993-94.3 This amount does not include the
much larger revenues of their state and local affiliates; to illustrate
the staggering amounts involved, the 1993-94 revenues for some
state and local affiliates were as follows:
<UL>
<LI><B>Pennsylvania State Education Association $85,487,844 (NEA
affiliate)</B> 
<LI><B>New York State United Teachers $83,832,247 (AFT affiliate)</B>

<LI><B>Michigan Education Association $77,430,813 (NEA affiliate)</B>

<LI><B>California Teachers Association $73,831,600 (NEA affiliate)
United Federation of Teachers (NYC) $64,165,975 (AFT affiliate)</B>

<LI><B>Illinois Education Association $25,845,622 (NEA affiliate)</B>

<LI><B>Florida Education Association $13,587,846 (NEA affiliate)</B>

<LI><B>New York Educators Association $10,342,336 (NEA affiliate)
To reiterate, these amounts do not include various off-budget
revenues which are often used to shield union revenues from member
and public scrutiny.</B> 
</UL>

<P>
These immense union revenues in toto underscore a critical point.
The NEA and AFT opposed market oriented educational reforms long
before the advent of collective bargaining in education. Such
opposition was somewhat softened by the fact that Catholic school
teachers and in the case of the AFT, Catholic teacher unions,
were affiliated with the national unions. Nevertheless, widespread
teacher unionization was not the cause of NEA/AFT opposition to
school choice and privatization; it was however, the development
that vastly increased their resources to oppose these changes.
This point is evident in their membership and resources today;
NEA/AFT membership, staff, dues, and revenues are much higher
in the states which have legalized teacher bargaining than in
the states which have not done so.
<P>
It must be emphasized, however, that the sheer amount of union
resources, awesome as it is, does not fully convey NEA/AFT advantages
in political arenas. The following considerations underscore this
point.
<P>
1. Most union revenues, including PAC funds, are deducted from
payroll and transmitted promptly to the union <U><B>at no cost
to the union.</B></U> In contrast, when citizens, taxpayers, and/or
parents oppose union-supported candidates, a significant proportion
of their contributions must be devoted to fundraising. Thus, $100,000
available to the union can be devoted almost entirely to the candidates
and causes supported by the unions. In contrast, a third to one-half
of $100,000 available to union opposition is typically devoted
to fundraising. The disparity in the costs of fundraising were
illustrated dramatically in the 1993 campaign in California over
Proposition 174. The California Teachers Association (CTA) assessed
its 200,000 teacher members $19 each for three years and the assessment
was implemented by payroll deductions and transmitted to the union
by school districts. Meanwhile, the proponents of Proposition
174 were forced to devote substantial resources to identifying
and raising funds to support Proposition 174.
<P>
2. Typical teacher union contracts not only require school boards
to collect and transmit funds for the union PAC <U><B>at no cost
to the union</B></U>; they accord the union a veto power over
any other deduction, such as for a Republican PAC. State and local
teacher union PACs raise 25 to 50 times as much from payroll deductions
as from cash contributions, hence union veto power over payroll
deductions constitutes a huge union advantage in the political
fundraising. In my opinion, there are major constitutional as
well as public policy issues involved in requiring or allowing
a government agency to collect political contributions for a private
organization, which can veto any other payroll deduction for a
PAC. Since the overwhelming portion of teacher union PAC funds
goes to Democrats, Republican legislators have ample partisan
as well as public policy reasons to prohibit the practice cited
above.
<P>
3. The teacher unions are organized to influence legislative and
public opinion; the unions raise teacher compensation this way,
not by providing better service at a lower cost. Consequently,
union revenues flow into a structure and process which is geared
to political action. In contrast, the opposition to union candidates
and positions must often devote substantial resources to organizational
issues.
<P>
4. In school districts in which NEA/AFT affiliates are the bargaining
agent, teachers who do not wish to support union bargaining or
political agendas must act to avoid contributing to these agendas.
Frequently the actions required for avoidance are unpopular or
require a major effort with no assurance of success. Needless
to say, the fact that the burden of action is on union opponents
is a tremendous advantage for the unions. This is especially evident
in the case of new hires, who often are not aware of their options
with respect to union dues and agency shop fees.
<P>
5. The teacher unions assert that most of their revenues are devoted
to collective bargaining, not political action. As I and others
have argued elsewhere, collective bargaining <U>is</U> political
action in the public sector. When teacher unions bargain, their
objective is to persuade public officials to adopt policies supportive
of union interests. Political action has the same objective directed
at the same public officials. Furthermore, the strategy and tactics
employed in bargaining are virtually identical to those employed
in political campaigns: Advertisements, letters to public officials,
new releases discrediting the opposition, demonstrations, appeals
to the citizenry, and so on. Unlike private sector bargaining
which is an economic conflict between employers and unions representing
employees, teacher bargaining is a contest for public opinion,
that is, a political one.
<P>
Even if the distinction between public sector bargaining and political
action is valid in some respects, the overlap between them is
important. Union revenues flow to union staff who are sophisticated
political operatives. The union bargaining manuals emphasize the
various techniques for exerting political pressure on school boards
in the bargaining process. The bottom line is that most union
revenues go to experienced political operatives; union staff who
operate telephone banks to pressure school boards into approving
union bargaining proposals do not need any training on how to
operate telephone banks in political campaigns.
<P>
6. Both teachers and union staff are able to devote more time
to political campaigns than most employed adults. Most NEA/AFT
representatives are employed under contracts which allow the unions
to deploy their field staff as needed in political campaigns;
their bargaining duties seldom interfere with their political
efforts. Teachers generally work less than 180 days a year and
are required to be in school only six to seven hours a day when
they do work. In addition, the teacher unions frequently urge
their members to vote by absentee ballot so as to free them up
for campaign activities on election day. The unions frequently
urge their members to take &quot;personal necessity leave&quot;
on election day to be available for election day support activities.
This tactic is especially convenient where the union contract
allows one or more days of &quot;personal necessity leave&quot;
at no loss in pay, and no questions asked. Not many private sector
employees are paid their regular salary for electioneering on
election day.
<P>
Although not exhaustive, the foregoing considerations virtually
dictate educational reform strategy in the immediate future. That
strategy must be to weaken the teacher unions financially. Any
success in achieving this objective will facilitate virtually
all conservative objectives, educational and non-educational.
Conservatives must not merely oppose the NEA and AFT over the
expansion of union prerogatives or over such discrete educational
issues as outcomes based education, sex education, or multiculturalism.
Instead, their objective must be to starve the gorilla, so that
it can no long intimidate its neighbors over all such issues.
If ever there were a need for conservatives to get their educational
priorities straight, the next two years will be that time. It
would be difficult to think of a situation in which the partisan
interests of Republicans coincides as much with their public policy
objectives.
<P>
Like public sector unions generally, NEA/AFT support higher taxes,
higher levels of government expenditures, and the elimination
of restrictions on taxes or expenditures, like the balanced budget
amendment or supermajorities for tax increases. Public unions
have become the most powerful constituency for bigger government,
and the NEA/AFT provide more and more of the resources and leadership
for these unions. The serious question is not whether but how
to end their excessive influence over educational policy.
<P>
Essentially there are three ways to achieve this overriding objective.
<OL>
<LI>Reduce union revenues.
<LI>Eliminate various taxpayer subsidies to the unions which never
should have been allowed in the first place.
<LI>Impose the requirements that apply to private sector unions
under the National Labor Relations Act to the teacher unions under
state bargaining statutes.
</OL>

<P>
Before discussing these options, let me comment briefly on repeal
of the state bargaining statutes which are the foundation of NEA/AFT
power. My analysis does not assume the likelihood of widespread
repeal, but repeal is clearly warranted on two grounds. First,
as a growing number of analysts have recognized, public sector
bargaining is inherently anti-democratic. Essentially, it involves
the negotiation of public policies with one interest group, in
a process from which other parties are excluded. The policies
negotiated are personnel policies, but they are public, not private
policies. Their anti-democratic nature is revealed most dramatically
in the states which have legalized teacher strikes. In these states,
the legislatures have in effect allowed one private interest group,
the teacher unions, the legal authority to suspend a public service
until it achieves public policies acceptable to it. No other parties
have this right.
<P>
Ironically, teacher bargaining was initially presented as an equity
issue: Private sector employees have the right to bargain and
strike if they wish, but public sector employees do not. Ergo,
public sector bargaining and the right to strike are essential
to remedy the inequity. In all of this rhetoric, the fact that
terms and conditions of public school employment, even in the
absence of bargaining, were far superior to private school employment
was simply ignored. The basic conflict between public sector bargaining
and representative government was obscured by the terminology.
Policy makers did not ask: &quot;Should public policies be negotiated
with one interest group in a process which excludes other interested
parties?&quot; Instead, the question raised was &quot;Should public
sector employees have the same rights as private sector ones?&quot;
The upshot was and is that teacher bargaining has led to flagrant
inequities in our political system. The repeal of the state bargaining
statutes is essential to terminate these inequities.
<P>
Another sufficient rationale for repeal of the bargaining statutes,
is the fact that collective bargaining is an outmoded system of
employment relations which does not serve employees, employers,
or the public very well. Today, it is clear that the teachers
embraced unionization precisely when it was beginning its precipitous
decline in the private sector. The main reason its decline has
not become a free fall is that our political leaders have not
articulated the viable alternatives to collective bargaining.
As a result, teachers and others are left with the two equally
unattractive options: collective bargaining and unionization on
the one hand, and unfettered managerial discretion on the other.
Unionization will survive as long as these are the only options,
but even the AFL-CIO's own polls reveal that two-thirds of nonmembers
do not believe unions are necessary.
<P>
As in the private sector, favorable legislation is absolutely
crucial to union power. As a result of the 1994 elections, however,
the Republicans control both state houses and the governorship.
Another five states have a Republican governor and a Republican
majority in one house in the legislature. At least 10 of these
20 states have enacted bargaining laws which are the foundation
of union power and resources; It is safe to say, however, that
if a few of these states, or perhaps only one of the larger ones
such as California, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, or Pennsylvania,
repealed its teacher bargaining statute, the momentum to repeal
them elsewhere would be unstoppable.
<H3><A NAME="Reducing_Union_Revenue"></A>Reducing Union Revenues
</H3>

<P>
Because the Republican governors and legislative majorities may
be unable or unwilling to repeal the bargaining statutes, let
me now turn to the other ways to reduce the excessive union domination
of education policy. To a large degree, membership and revenues
are interdependent sources of union power. More members lead to
more revenue; similarly, the higher the revenues, the greater
the union ability to increase its membership by organizing drives
and legislation that is conducive to increased membership.
<P>
Probably the most important source of union revenues outside of
member dues is the agency shop fee. These are fees paid to the
union by non-members who are represented by a union against their
wishes. In the 21 right to work states, unions and employers cannot
require non-members of the union to pay a service fee to the union
as a term or condition of employment. In the remaining states,
however, such clauses are legally permissible insofar as state
law in concerned. In these states, the NEA/AFT try to negotiate
contractual provisions that require non-members to pay a service
fee to the union. Although an agency shop fee is not mandatory
unless the employer agrees to fire the employees who do not pay
it, school boards, especially where board members were elected
with union support, are frequently willing to accept the union
proposal regardless of its implications for teacher rights. School
board acceptance is often based on the fact that the agency shop
fee is extremely valuable to the union but appears to be costless
to the board - the nonmember of the union, not the school board
has to absorb the cost. Thus school boards can often extract important
concessions from the teacher unions by accepting union proposals
on agency shop fees.
<P>
Contrary to much popular rhetoric, employees cannot be forced
to become union members against their wishes. Nonetheless, unions
are required to represent nonmembers and members alike in an appropriate
bargaining unit, and represent them without discrimination based
on membership status.
<P>
The union rationale for agency shop fees is that it is unfair
for nonmembers to receive the benefits of union representation
but not have to pay their &quot;fair share&quot; of the costs
thereof. Whatever the label, however, the union rationale is a
basket case. Many teachers could command higher salaries in the
absence of union representation. For example, many districts are
willing to pay higher salaries to mathematics and science teachers
but cannot do so because the union contract invariably requires
that teachers be paid at the same rate, regardless of subject
or grade level. This union imperative grows out of the union's
need to avoid intra-union conflict over salaries; also, the unions
hope to raise the salaries of all teachers by emphasizing that
salaries are not high enough to recruit mathematics and science
teachers,
<P>
To cite an even more egregious case, consider the situation of
newly hired teachers in districts where layoffs become necessary.
The unions typically insist that layoffs be in order of reverse
seniority, that is, last hired is first fired. It often happens
that school districts would prefer to retain the younger teachers.
It is ridiculous to force them to pay for the benefits of union
representation, when the &quot;benefit&quot; is being fired from
a job they could keep in the absence of union representation.
<P>
At any rate, in the current state of the law, nonmembers can be
required to pay their pro rata share of the union's costs of collective
bargaining, grievance processing, and contract administration.
They cannot legally be charged for other union expenses, including
expenditures for political activities. Naturally, the unions categorize
their expenditures so as to maximize the service fees they can
charge nonmembers. As clearly revealed in litigation on the issue,
the NEA and AFT are engaged in massive deception in this respect.
It is impossible to establish precisely the amounts collected
illegally because of deceptive union accounting practices, but
tens of millions annually would be a conservative estimate.
<P>
Let us see why the union revenues from illegal agency shop fees
cannot be estimated precisely. In some states, the union records
show both the amounts collected from dues and from service fees.
In practice, these figures do not take into account the dynamics
of the situation. Suppose, for example, that union dues are $600
in toto (local, state and national) and the union asserts that
nonmembers can be charged 90 percent of this amount ($540). Under
these circumstances, some teachers will prefer to become union
members and to pay the full union dues. No matter how much the
agency shop fee, the nonmember does not have a right to vote on
the proposed contract, or to participate in union discussions
on contractual issues. In some situations, the teacher unions
have allowed nonmenbers to participate in these matters, but the
unions have done so only for tactical reasons. In addition, there
may be a stigma attached to a refusal to pay full union dues.
Thus some teachers accept union membership and pay full union
dues, despite their underlying opposition to union membership.
The nonmember's attitude is likely to be: &quot;Why should I risk
thousands to win an award of a few hundred dollars?&quot; In this
situation, the dues revenue is really due to the existence of
the agency shop fee; in the absence of the fee, many teachers
would not become union members and pay full union dues.
<P>
Contrast the above scenario with one in which the agency shop
fee was 20 percent of union dues ($120). In this situation, many
more teachers will elect not to become union members and pay full
union dues. Obviously, individuals vary on the issue but generally
speaking, the lower the agency shop fee, the more teachers refuse
to join and pay full union dues.
<P>
Needless to say, the teacher unions are not forthcoming about
agency shop issues. As a matter of fact, the unions continue to
negotiate clauses which require nonmembers to pay the equivalent
of union dues or amounts that are clearly excessive. In the absence
of remedial legislation, litigation and publicity to stop such
practices are essential. All teachers should be informed that
they can call the National Right to Work Committee or Legal Defense
Foundation at 1-800-336-3600 for immediate free legal assistance
to avoid excessive agency shop fees. In conjunction with an active
program to inform school boards and school administrators of teacher
rights and management legal vulnerabilities on these issues, it
should be possible to reduce union revenues substantially. It
should be emphasized that union dues are bound to increase, and
as they do, teacher willingness to pay them will decline.
<P>
Perhaps the most remarkable fact about NEA/AFT revenues is the
way they have been ignored by conservative policymakers and strategists.
The Public Service Research Council (PSRC) has struggled against
the enactment of new state bargaining statutes, but the National
Right to Work Committee (NRTWC) and its sister organization, the
National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation (NRTWLDF) are
the only organizations that have actually rolled back union revenues.
They have done so through an aggressive state legislative and
litigation program which challenges both the amount of the agency
shop fees and the absence of procedural safeguards for teachers
who challenge them. As of December 1994, NRTWLDF has litigated
598 cases against the NEA; of these, over 100 are ongoing. In
several cases in the past, it has achieved substantial monetary
awards (up to $238,000) and judicial safeguards for agency fee
payors. Most importatntly, NRTWLDF successfully argued the cases
in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that agency shop fees were
constitutionally limited to the nonmembers pro-rata share of the
costs of collective bargaining, grievance processing, and contract
administration. These legal precedents have led to a substantial
reduction in NEA/AFT revenues with significant potential for a
crippling blow thereto.
<P>
Despite the outcomes of the 1994 elections, agency shop concessions
to the teacher unions may be even more of a threat than previously.
Wherever school funding is tight, school boards are more apt to
agree to concessions that appear to cost the taxpayers nothing.
Thus school boards which cannot raise teacher salaries will be
especially tempted to accept agency shop clauses as a substitute
for monetary concessions. The long range consequences of such
concessions are often ignored in the unremitting pressure to find
concessions that will solve an immediate crisis.
<P>
Interestingly enough, the NRTWC faces a funding crisis of its
own, partly as the result of its success in the private sector.
NRTWC was established to promote the idea that employees should
not be forced to join a union or pay service fees to them as a
term or condition of employment. As long as NRTWC's main focus
was on the private sector, its private sector support was adequate
although never plentiful. As its focus shifted to the public sector,
NRTWC's private sector sources of support have become increasingly
inadequate because legislation and litigation relating to teacher
unions tend to be state by state, not one shot federal issues.
In any event, it is ironic that a non-educational organization,
established before the NEA was a union, should carry such a heavy
burden of protecting individual teachers from excessive teacher
union fees.
<H3><A NAME="Conclusion"></A><A NAME="Eliminating_Taxpayer_Subsidies_To_Teache"></A>Eliminating
Taxpayer Subsidies to Teacher Unions </H3>

<P>
In addition to reducing teacher union revenues, legislation is
needed to eliminate taxpayer subsidies to them. Eliminating the
subsidies will force the NEA and AFT to absorb various costs,
thus decreasing the availability of union revenues for blocking
much needed educational reforms.
<P>
Although most subsidies must be eliminated by state action, Congress
also has some work to do. Elimination of the tax exemption for
the NEA building in Washington would be a good place to start.
The tax exemption was included in the NEA's Congressional charter
in 1907, when no one envisaged the possibility that the NEA would
become a labor union. By the terms of the charter, the exemption
applies as long as the NEA building is used for the purposes spelled
out in the charter, which it clearly is not. The District of Columbia
should have revoked the tax exemption on grounds that the building
is not being used for its chartered purposes, but the NEA has
carefully cultivated DC officials to forestall any such eventuality.
In any case, we can hardly expect the Democratic district leadership
to eliminate the tax exemption for one of its major constituencies
of the Democratic Party.
<P>
According to district records, the NEA building carries an assessed
valuation of $64.8 million. The taxes on commercial property with
such an assessment would be almost $1.4 million, roughly equivalent
to NEA dues from 14,000 NEA members. Is removing the exemption
justified in terms of public policy? The six other organizations
chartered by Congress are the American Legion, the American National
Red Cross, American War Mothers, AMVETS, the Boy Scouts of America,
and the Disabled American Veterans. The NEA is the only labor
union building enjoying a tax exemption and no one doubts that
the NEA would not have received a Congressional charter in 1907,
or, could have received one recently, as a union. As a matter
of fact, AFT President Albert Shanker also tried to eliminate
the tax exemption for the NEA building, albeit before the merger
talks and as long as his role in the matter could be hidden from
public view. Finally, the District of Columbia faces an enormous
budget deficit; the Republican Congress has every reason to insist
upon the elimination of preferential tax treatment for the Democratic
political allies of district officials.
<P>
Federal largesse flows to the AFT as well as the NEA. AFT President
Albert Shanker is a director of the National Endowment for Democracy.
Not surprisingly, the National Endowment for Democracy subsidized
travel by AFT members to Eastern Europe, to advise teachers there
how to teach about democracy. Needless to say, federal funding
did not envisage any attention to the anti-democratic nature of
state educational monopolies.
<P>
Other prime candidates for federal and state chopping blocks are
the appropriations to and for the National Board for Professional
Teaching Standards (NBPTS). NBPTS is an NEA/AFT sponsored board
intended to develop and implement a system of national board certification
for teachers. In addition to $25 million appropriated by Congress
to NBPTS, several states have appropriated funds to implement
the NBPTS game plan. Elsewhere, I have summarized the case against
government support for NBPTS, and shall not repeat the litany
of reasons here.4 For present purposes, however, I cite it merely
to illustrate the fact that government subsidies to the NEA and
AFT are often channelled through their satellite organizations.
<P>
Most taxpayer subsidies to the teacher unions are the result of
school board concessions at the bargaining table. For instance,
most NEA/AFT officers and staff are former teachers. When they
accept full-time union employment, they take a leave of absence
from the school district to preserve their pension rights. Typically
the union reimburses the district for the appropriate salary to
enable the district to hire a replacement, but the district continues
to contribute to the teacher retirement system for the teachers
on leave this way. These contributions in toto can be a significant
amount; for example, the New York City Board of Education pays
the retirement contribution for about 30 teachers on leave as
full-time union staff. In some cases, the retirement contributions
are $15,000 annually. In toto, the amount is not a large one in
terms of the Board of Education Budget, but it is in terms of
the union's. In many cases, union staff receive a generous pension
from the teacher retirement systems, even though the individuals
involved have actually taught only a few years. This practice
could and should be stopped by requiring the union to absorb the
retirement contribution and by enacting a two year limit on leaves
of absence.
<P>
Another hidden taxpayer subsidy is released time with pay for
teachers to conduct union business. This subsidy comes in many
forms: Days off, or so many periods a day, or a specified number
of days to be taken upon notice by the teacher union member. Also,
school districts often provide generous amounts of released time
with pay for the union bargaining team. In these situations, the
district often pays the salary and fringe benefits for the teachers
and the cost of the substitutes needed as well.
<P>
Perhaps the most critical subsidy is payroll deduction and transmittal
of union dues and PAC funds at no cost to the union. Unquestionably,
union revenues would plummet in the absence of payroll deduction,
which is not costless to the school district even if it is to
the union. To avoid waivers by union dominated school boards,
the legislatures should enact a minimum collection fee, leaving
it to the boards to require higher fees if appropriate. The main
problem in requiring the union to pay its own way is that the
requirement would usually have to be applicable to non-union and
charitable organizations; nevertheless requiring everyone to pay
is a far better solution than having nobody pay.
<H3><A NAME="Empowering_Rank_and_File_Union_Members"></A>Empowering
Rank and File Union Members </H3>

<P>
The third category of changes would not affect the unions directly
but would empower the silent majority in the union ranks. The
most important change in this category is to require NEA and AFT
affiliates to meet the reporting and disclosure requirements applicable
to private sector unions under the Landrum-Griffin Act. Section
201 of the act provides that
<P>
&quot;(b) Every labor organization shall file annually with the
Secretary a financial report signed by its president and treasurer
or corresponding principal officers containing the following information
in such detail as may be necessary accurately to disclose its
financial condition and operations for its preceding fiscal year---
<P>
(1) assets and liabilities at the beginning and end of the fiscal
year;
<P>
(2) receipts of any kind and the sources thereof;
<P>
(3) salary, allowances, and other direct or indirect disbursements
(including reimbursed expenses) to each officer and also to each
employee who, during such fiscal year, received more than $10,000
in the aggregate from such labor organization and any other labor
organization affiliated with it or with which it is affiliated,
or which is affiliated with the same national or international
labor organization;
<P>
(4) direct and indirect loans made to any officer, employee, or
member, which aggregated more than $250 during the fiscal year,
together with a statement of the purpose, security if any, and
arrangements for repayment;
<P>
(5) direct and indirect loans to any business enterprise, together
with a statement of the purpose, security, if any, and arrangements
for repayment; and
<P>
(6) other disbursements made by it including the purposes thereof;
all in such categories as the Secretary may prescribe.
<P>
(c) Every labor organization required to submit a report under
this title shall make available the information required to be
contained in such report to all of its members, and every such
labor organization and its officers shall be under a duty enforceable
at the suit of any member of such organization in any State court
of competent jurisdiction or in the district court of the United
States for the district in which such labor organization maintains
its principal office, to permit such member for just cause to
examine any books, records, and accounts necessary to verify such
report.&quot;
<P>
Why were the various protections accorded union members in the
private sector not included in the state bargaining laws? The
state laws were ordinarily drafted by union attorneys who wanted
to avoid regulation of their clients as much as possible. They
were successful in this effort for two reasons. First, because
labor relations is mainly regulated by federal labor law, the
state legislatures were not very sophisticated analysts of labor
legislation, nor did they have the resources available to Congressional
committees on the subject. Second, school management also lacked
any familiarity with collective bargaining; most school board
members and school administrators were (and still are) unaware
of the major provisions of the Landrum-Griffin Act. The upshot
was that the state bargaining statutes frequently do not include
even minimal safeguards for union members vis-a-vis' their unions.
<P>
In enacting these safeguards, the legislatures should remedy various
weaknesses in Landrum-Griffin. For example, the act requires unions
to report the salaries and expenses of union officers and employees
receiving more than $10,000 a year on Department of Labor Form
LM-2. The fact that unions are not required to report the fringe
benefits is a major deficiency which should be corrected by Congressional
and state action. To appreciate the importance of the issue, consider
that the NEA funds over 1,500 &quot;UniServ directors,&quot; that
is, field representatives who negotiate for one or more local
affiliates. UniServ staff salaries range from $60,000 to $120,000
and average about $100,000; fringe benefits probably add about
35 percent to total compensation.
<P>
Understandably, the NEA would face a public relations disaster
if it were forced to reveal the fact that it employs such a huge
highly paid staff. To avoid this, the NEA funds the UniServ program
through its state and local affiliates, so that most UniServ staff
are employees of these affiliates, not the NEA. Not surprisingly,
only nine NEA state affiliates are required to file the LM-2.
The NEA's complex precautions against full disclosure of UniServ
compensation suggests that it shares my view that full disclosure
would indeed discredit the NEA among its members and the public
at large.
<H3>Conclusion </H3>

<P>
Let me conclude on a note of cautious optimism. The proposals
made here vary widely in their political feasibility and their
impact on teacher unions. Undoubtedly, some proposals not made
would be more useful in some states. The critical question is
whether conservatives (those who support less government, lower
taxes, and more reliance on markets and incentives) understand
that the public sector unions are the major opposition to their
objectives. Once this understanding becomes widespread, the specifics
in this article may be replaced by more drastic measures, such
as the prohibition of public sector bargaining. At the end of
1994, such an outcome seems at least as likely as the continuation
of NEA/AFT political influence.
<P>
Paradoxically, the rollback of NEA/AFT political power will often
be easier to achieve in the nonbargaining states, that is, the
states in which the unions already are not so dominant. The NEA
and AFT allocate their resources from a national standpoint. Thus
funds generated in the bargaining states are spent in the nonbargaining
ones to enact legislation requiring school boards to bargain with
teacher unions. Educational reformers must adopt a similar perspective.
If they reduce NEA/AFT membership and revenues in the nonbargaining
states, they thereby weaken the unions in all states. For example,
it is much easier to require the unions to pay the costs of payroll
deductions of union dues in the nonbargaining states than in the
bargaining ones. It is a major strategic error to focus entirely
on the states where it is most imperative to reduce union influence
over educational policy.
<P>
One final comment. The survival of teacher union viability among
teachers rests upon the perception that the only alternative is
unrestricted managerial discretion, the framework of employment
relations in the pre-bargaining era. This framework is not persuasive,
even among the teachers who were not around at that time. Consequently,
a new framework of employment relations is essential. To be viable,
an alternative to the NEA and AFT must propose such a framework.
Thus the task that lies ahead is to create a system of educational
employment relations that avoids the deficiencies of the pre-bargaining
era as well as those inherent in collective bargaining. Although
relatively little attention is being paid to this task, it is
critical to get us to the post-bargaining era.<HR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>THE PTA; WHAT SHOULD ITS ROLE BE IN ITS SECOND
CENTURY?<BR>
</FONT>by Charlene K. Haar<P>
Reprinted from Harte-Hanks Community Newspapers<br>North Dallas and Surrounding Communities<br>June 30, 1996<P>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>What the PTA is Now<BR>
<BR>
</B>                To survive and thrive in the next century,
the PTA must do an about-face and revert back to its educational
purpose.  In this new role, the PTA would become the major resource
for accurate, impartial materials to help parents understand what
is happening in their own children's learning environment and
in education generally.  In time, the PTA could be a trusted resource
for the public, for policymakers, and for teachers.<BR>
<BR>
        As it operates now, PTA's ineffectiveness can be attributed
to several inter-related problems: <BR>
<BR>
   <LI>     <B>Teacher union influence.</B>  National PTA policies and positions
reflect the dominant influence of the teacher unions - the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT) and especially the National Education
Association (NEA).<BR>
       <LI> <B>Misdirected resources.</B>  At the local level, the PTA is
a fundraising auxiliary for school districts, while its child
advocacy efforts focus on social, non-educational issues.<BR>
      <LI>  <B>Stifled debate.</B>  Many PTA officials stifle open discussion
of controversial issues, discourage parents from questioning the
PTA's official positions, and restrict meetings to dues-paying
parents and teachers.<BR>
     <LI>   <B>Ignorance.</B>  Most PTA members (80% in a recent national
poll) have no idea of the policies advocated in their name by
the national and state PTA hierarchies. <BR>
        <BR>
<B>PTA's Course<BR>
<BR>
</B>        At its centennial celebration kickoff last month,
PTA leaders revealed their goals for the next century: shed the
bake sale image, step up lobbying efforts to become serious players
in policy making efforts, enlarge the membership, collaborate
with businesses, other organizations and government to make a
greater impact, and oh yes, help train parents.  Clearly, most
of these objectives are intended to enhance the position and prestige
of PTA's national leaders.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>What Works<BR>
<BR>
</B>        It should come as no surprise that greater family
involvement in children's learning is a critical link to achieving
a high-quality education.  In fact, the formula is quite simple:
 Families must take a more active role in their children's learning.
 All of these can be accomplished at home -  without the PTA:
 Read together.  Use TV wisely.  Establish a daily family routine.
 Schedule daily homework times.  Monitor out-of-school activities.
 Talk with children and teenagers.  Communicate positive values
and character traits, such as respect, hard work and responsibility.
 Express high expectations and offer praise and encouragement
for achievement. <BR>
<BR>
<B>What PTA Should Do<BR>
<BR>
</B>        To be effective for parents - and ultimately for children
- the PTA should:  Abandon its intent to become yet another group
lobbying for government programs and increased government funding.
 Drop its union-like unified membership structure. Replace the
practice of fundraising activities which are now all too often
a diversion to more meaningful discussions and activities.  End
the practice of taking sides on issues which then eliminate parental
debate.  Instead, PTA should strive to become the most prestigious,
unbiased, educational resource center in America by greatly expanding
its role as a non-profit, charitable and educational organization.
<BR>
<BR>
        To accomplish this, PTA should support original research
on issues of concern to parents.  Where unbiased information already
exists, PTA should translate that into parent-friendly publications
useful for their use.  <BR>
<BR>
        Most parents are concerned about what's happening in the
schools.  Many don't know what's being taught or how their children
learn.  And they don't understand how to relate to teachers and
school systems.  Often parents are intimidated by the system and
don't know what to do.  When so many others are obviously in charge
of making decisions, there seems to be little left for parents
to decide.  Furthermore, parents feel intimidated by their unequal
role.  <BR>
<BR>
        That inequality gap can be closed by accurate information
and open discussions.  Both are essential to eliminating some
of the barriers that now exist for parents, between parents and
teachers, and between the school and the community.<BR>
<BR>
        As a national resource center, the PTA could insure its
productive role into the next century; as it operates now, it
is merely an adjunct of the NEA.<BR>

</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
WASHINGTON, D.C., June 21, 1996 - Eighty percent (80%) of parents
across the country with kids in school are solidly unaware of
the active lobbying and issue positions espoused by the National
Parent Teacher Association (PTA), according to the results of
a recent national poll sponsored by the Education Policy Institute.
<P>
In fact, more than half (51%) of parents say they would be less
likely to join the PTA knowing that the nation's most prominent
parent-teacher organization opposes a school voucher proposal,
the poll, which was conducted May 14 to 17 among parents of children
in K through 12<SUP>th</SUP> grade, shows.
<P>
&quot;I think it's important that as PTA leaders across the country
gather this weekend for their national convention, they need to
know the rank and file members of the PTA are ignorant of what
the national leadership is doing,&quot; said Charlene Haar, President
of the Washington, D.C.-based Education Policy Institute.
<P>
Fully 70% of members of the PTA do not even know of the organization
taking a stance on political issues, the poll shows.
<P>
Haar said one of the most important findings of the poll was that
77% of parents believe the &quot;PTA should focus on providing
a forum for parents to discuss significant issues regarding their
children's education, rather than have PTA meetings almost exclusively
about fund-raising activities.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Parents' concerns are not being met by the PTA,&quot; Haar
said.
<P>
What's more, Haar said, 75% of parents who don't attend PTA meetings
would do so if the meetings dealt with critical educational issues
such as school policies or dismissal of incompetent teachers,
according to the results of the survey.
<P>
Other key findings of the poll, conducted by Wirthlin Worldwide,
are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Half (47%) of mothers would be MUCH more likely to attend
PTA meetings if they dealt with substantive issues related to
their child's education.
<LI>On a scale of one to ten with ten being the highest, parents
with an unfavorable impression of the PTA rate &quot;acts as a
voice for parental concerns&quot; an 8.3 in terms of importance,
yet only give the PTA a 4.3 in terms of its performance in this
area.
<LI>The PTA is exceeding parental expectations only in the area
of conducting fund-raisers for school activities, equipment, and
supplies. That is, parents give fund-raisers a 7.7 in terms of
importance, while they give fund-raisers an 8.2 in terms of how
the PTA is performing in this area.
<LI>Parents with the highest percentage holding a negative impression
of the PTA are those most concerned about curriculum issues (21%),
former members of the PTA (14%), and PTA members who do not attend
PTA meetings (14%).
<LI>Parents rate &quot;acts as a voice for parental concerns about
curriculum and teachers&quot; at 8.4 in terms of importance, yet
they only give the PTA a 6.7 in terms of its performance in this
area. 
</UL>

<P>
The poll reflects the results of 601 parents of children in K
through 12<SUP>th</SUP> grade nationwide. Survey responses were
gathered randomly between May 14 and 17, using a listed sample
of known households of parents with school-age children.
<P>
The margin of error for a sample size of 601 is <U>+</U> 4.0 percentage
points in 95 out of 100 cases. Any questions relating to these
findings should be directed to Charlene Haar at 202-244-7535,
or Neal Rhoades and Maury Giles at Wirthlin Worldwide, headquartered
in McLean, Virginia, at 703-556-0001.

<P>Since the publication of &quot;A Nation at Risk&quot; in 1983, Americans have become increasingly alarmed about the dismal results and soaring costs of their public schools. No group of citizens has a closer view of these problems or a more immediate stake in addressing them than the parents of the country's 48 million schoolchildren. Here and there, parents have won minor battles to influence curricula or oust mediocre school-board members. But as individuals, parents are no match for the forces that favor the status quo. </P>
<P>Parents' most promising forum to agitate for reform and hold their local educators accountable for failure already exists: the venerated National Congress of Parents and Teachers, commonly known as the PTA. Unfortunately, parents cannot count on either their local PTA or its national leadership to advance parental interests&#151;or even air diverse viewpoints. As it operates today, the PTA is useless to parents who want to play a meaningful role in educational reform.</P>
<P>The mission of the PTA has always been to &quot;work on behalf of the best interests of all children on issues that affect their health, education, and welfare&quot; and &quot;to encourage parent involvement.&quot; With almost seven million members, the PTA offers great potential for promoting parental involvement in the educational welfare of children. But in the 1990s, that mission requires of the PTA something it has been unwilling to do: demand accountability for performance and spending at every level of the educational system. </P>
<P><B>Local Control</B></P>
<P>Decades ago, parents had significant influence over their neighborhood schools. Over the years, however, school districts consolidated, teachers and administrators came to see themselves as credentialed professionals, and state laws standardized educational practices and curricula. Today, many parents are less likely to get involved in their children's educational environment. Nevertheless, the impetus for reform will have to come from parents active at the grass roots.</P>
<P>The PTA ought to be helping such parents overcome the considerable barriers to holding local educators accountable. For instance, it should be of great concern to parents that student grades tend to be as high in low-achieving as in high-achieving schools, but the PTA deliberately avoids such educational issues.</P>
<P>In the annual battles over allocating financial resources, the PTA should play a major role in deciphering complicated budgets for the benefit of interested parents. Instead, PTAs rally with teachers unions for tax increases, seldom questioning the effect on parents or the educational outcomes for students.</P>
<P>Parents also deserve greater consideration of their interests in the contract negotiations that determine pay and working conditions for teachers. For instance, teachers in Montgomery County, Maryland, refused to write recommendations for their college-bound students because such &quot;extra&quot; duties weren't in their contract. In some areas, a parent who wishes to lodge a complaint about a teacher must navigate a bureaucratic process established by contract. Parents may have to submit a written account of the grievance in order to secure a meeting with the teacher, who has the right to bring along a union representative. Some parents find such time-consuming and intimidating conditions a clear subordination of parental interests to teacher rights.</P>
<P>It is indisputable that teachers are already well represented in negotiations. Therefore, an effective local PTA that works on behalf of parental interests should insist on more than the current minimal accord paid to parental concerns. Working through the PTA, parents could ensure that their schools:</P>
<P>&#149; Demand pro-parent scrutiny of teacher contracts;</P>
<P>&#149; Justify their annual budgets;</P>
<P>&#149; Air alternative views to the pro-union positions on privatization,  teacher tenure, tuition-tax credits, school choice, and teacher standards;</P>
<P>&#149; Establish expeditious complaint procedures so that parents could      challenge decisions and actions of teachers or administrators;    </P>
<P>&#149; Make certain that student grades provide parents with adequate information about the educational progress of their children, or lack of it.</P>
<P>Nowadays, local matters are greatly affected by policy at higher levels. State governments now have a hand in everything from funding to curricular standards. President Clinton's Goals 2000 legislation, enacted last year and under review by the new Republican-controlled Congress, may bring down the heavy hand of the federal government, too (see sidebar, page 88). Similarly, PTA members who wish to be active at the local level must take account of PTA policies set by the state and national hierarchies and imposed on individual chapters.</P>
<P>At the least, the PTA has the power to keep parents informed of academic issues, from educational policies set at the national and state levels to the curriculum and employment practices of their local schools. At its best, the PTA could help frame the national debate over educational reform, lobby for some of the reforms that debate has already produced, and work to change the restrictive collective-bargaining statutes that tend to shield teacher unions and teachers from accountability and limit parental involvement.</P>
<P><B>Why the PTA Is Weak</B></P>
<P>&#149; PTA's ineffectiveness can be attributed to six inter-related areas:</P>
<P>&#149; Misdirected resources. At the local level, the PTA has become a fundraising auxiliary for school districts, while its child-advocacy efforts have focused on social, non-educational issues.</P>
<P>&#149; Stifled debate. Many PTA officials stifle open discussion of controversial issues and discourage parents from questioning the PTA's official positions.</P>
<P>&#149; Ignorance. Most PTA members have no idea of the policies advocated in their name by the PTA hierarchy at the national and state levels.</P>
<P>&#149; Careerism. The PTA's national officers are elected by a restrictive process that requires a national PTA presidential candidate to make a commitment of nearly 10 years to rise &quot;through the chairs.&quot; Consequently, many PTA national leaders serve long after their own children have left school.</P>
<P>&#149; Transient membership. Parental interest is often high at the elementary-school level, tapers off in middle school, and all but disappears in high school. As a result, PTA officers and professional staff have inordinate influence.</P>
<P>&#149; Teachers-union influence. National PTA policies, which often are automatically adopted as state and local PTA policies, reflect the dominant influence of the teachers unions, especially the National Education Association (NEA).</P>
<P>Of these factors, by far the most important is the last. Parents and teachers in the PTA both claim to share the same goal: promoting the educational welfare of children. But the PTA's governance structure, in which unionized teachers play a major role, is fatally flawed. Fundamentally, parents and their children are the consumers of education; teachers are part of the producer complex. Elevating the interests of the producers above the interests of the consumers is a formula for irrelevance. In the last 12 months, I have attended two national PTA meetings and five state conventions, and I cannot recall a single instance in which any policy contrary to the interests of teachers unions was given a proper hearing.</P>
<P>Ever since the 1960s, the NEA and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) have lobbied vigorously for state legislation requiring school boards to bargain collectively with teachers unions over the terms and conditions of employment. Teachers have the statutory right to bargain collectively in 34 states and the District of Columbia. Many school districts outside of those states engage in de facto collective bargaining with the teachers unions. By its refusal to challenge the teachers unions in collective bargaining, the PTA has eliminated itself as an independent advocate for parents. The PTA claims to &quot;seek to participate in the decisionmaking process establishing school policy.&quot; But whenever school boards sacrifice parental interests to union interests as often happens in these negotiations, the PTA cannot and will not object.</P>
<P>Such impotence has been apparent at least since the PTA's 1968 position statement on &quot;teacher negotiations, sanctions, and strikes.&quot; The PTA resolution, reaffirmed in 1987, identifies the &quot;dilemmas&quot; that teacher militancy and union negotiations impose on PTA members: </P>
<P>&#147;1. If the PTA provides volunteers to man the classrooms, during a  work stoppage, in the interest of protecting the immediate safety and  welfare of children, it is branded as a strike breaker.</P>
<P>&quot;2. If the PTA does not take sides in issue[s] being negotiated, it is accused of not being interested.</P>
<P>&#147;3. If it supports the positions of the board of education, which is the representative of the public in negotiations, the teacher members of the PTA have threatened to withdraw membership and boycott the  local PTA activities.&quot; (Italics added.)</P>
<P>Collective bargaining is used in most school districts to resolve such issues as teacher compensation for extra curricular activities, class size, parental grievance procedures, and the frequency and scheduling of parent/teacher conferences. In effect, the PTA does not take sides on issues subject to bargaining, regardless of their impact on students, parents, or the public. That position constitutes a major victory for unions and a setback for parents.</P>
<P>How are PTA members supposed to respond to this dilemma? The 1968 resolution urges them to be alert to symptoms of teacher dissatisfaction (abnormal turnover, complaints, and &quot;teacher-supported legislation defeated by state legislature&quot;) before a strike and to promote the public airing of issues. At no point does the PTA suggest that teacher dissatisfaction may be unwarranted. The PTA's statement acknowledges that the teachers' threat to withdraw membership and boycott the organization greatly concerns the scores of PTA's professional staff members at the state and national organizations.</P>
<P>This surrender may have the cost the organization anyway. The PTA does not keep track of the ratio of teachers to parents among its membership. But we do know that membership peaked in 1966, when more than 12 million teachers, administrators, and parents were members of the National PTA.</P>
<P>The organization then lost more than six million members from 1966 to 1982, years when collective bargaining by teachers unions increased to unprecedented levels. With the withdrawal of parent activists who refused to accept the PTA's subservience to union interests, the PTA has evolved into an NEA front on non-educational as well as educational issues.</P>
<P>To be sure, the PTA sponsors many worthwhile programs and activities. Few of them, however, relate to education. The PTA doesn't merely waste its potential for constructive action; it may even hinder reform. In recent years, the teachers' unions' formidable influence over the PTA has been seen in the following issues:</P>
<P>Opposition to school choice. In addition to its refusal to challenge union positions in collective bargaining and teacher strikes, the PTA opposes vouchers and tuition-tax credits that would empower parents to choose private schools. Thus the PTA has capitulated to the NEA/AFT insistence on maintaining the public-school monopoly at all costs.</P>
<P>Delegates to the 1994 state convention of the California Congress of Parents, Teachers, and Students (the California PTA) broke into thunderous applause when a speaker congratulated them on defeating the school-choice ballot initiative known as Proposition 174. &quot;You were the voice of the California children!&quot; she shouted. More than one million California PTA volunteers defeated Proposition 174, she said, and &quot;all the California Teachers Association did was put up the money.&quot;</P>
<P>In fact, the PTA provided a large bloc of foot soldiers in the campaign against Proposition 174. At one workshop, a PTA official reminded delegates that &quot;we will pull the PTA Charter if any unit goes beyond the PTA agenda&#151;as we would have with any PTA that supported vouchers.&quot;</P>
<P>No matter how modest a voucher plan might be, the PTA can be expected to oppose it. In 1994, New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman was expected to introduce a pilot program for school vouchers in the ailing Jersey City school system. Nevertheless, state and national PTA officials called the plan a &quot;threat&quot; to public education. As a result, New Jersey PTA delegates voted to &quot;[t]ake an active role in opposing&quot; private-school vouchers. Not surprisingly, the PTA and the New Jersey affiliate of the NEA joined a coalition to defeat this and all other voucher proposals.</P>
<P>Opposition to privatization. State PTAs structure their conventions to reinforce the national organization's opposition to privatization of school services. At Maryland's state PTA convention last year, the state vice president for legislative activity expressed hostility for privatization. Several delegates stomped out of a standing-room-only session on the topic when the state chairwoman refused to permit a balanced discussion of audience views on this issue. She instead rebutted criticism of PTA's opposition to contracting out school services. The reason for PTA opposition? Allegedly, some unionized employees could lose their jobs.</P>
<P>Focus on non-educational issues. PTA programs are designed to diminish dissatisfaction with poor school performance. Instead of conducting hearings to address the causes of academic deficiencies, PTAs sponsor events presenting students' work in the most favorable light. Much time and effort goes into women's auxiliary or support services: trip chaperoning, bake sales, and other fundraising activities. Clearly, good PTA parents are supposed to be passive supporters, not active critics, of schools and teachers.</P>
<P>Last summer, PTA delegates from 53 states and territories met in Las Vegas for the 98th annual national convention. Convention delegates received two days of workshops to learn how to produce materials that generate positive public reaction to PTA, respond to extremist groups challenging health/sex education curricula, implement the PTA's HIV/AIDS awareness programs, and rebut right-wing groups favoring school choice.</P>
<P>Delegates considered resolutions on violence in video games, inhalant abuse, the quality of indoor air in portable classrooms, and the sale, resale, and destruction of confiscated firearms. These are typical of the non-educational, social issues on which PTAs focus their time and money.</P>
<P><B>The PTA Stifles Dialogue</B></P>
<P>In its 1983 position statement in support of public education (revised and reaffirmed in 1991), the national PTA pledged to ensure that &quot;adequate, objective, and language-appropriate information be available to parents so that they can make informed decisions.&quot; Unfortunately, the PTA is ignoring this directive.</P>
<P>Given the way PTAs are governed, it is virtually impossible for parent members to develop parent-friendly policies that may conflict with the interests of teachers unions. Parents ought to have a forum for advocating the adoption of reforms like school-choice programs and the privatization of school services, ensuring that teachers are available for frequent conferences with parents, challenging teacher tenure, and assessing the value of report cards, grades, and standardized tests for measuring student performance. Unfortunately, many PTA parents are finding it increasingly difficult to articulate their needs and lodge their complaints within the PTA.</P>
<P>Taking such action within the PTA would require parents to challenge teachers and teachers unions at meetings where both are present. Many parents fear teacher retaliation if they aggressively advocate parental over teacher interests. PTA parents also feel intimidated by the overwhelming pro-union bias in PTA publications and programs, as seen in the selection of convention issues and speakers.</P>
<P>When one speaker after another proclaims the dangers of school choice, for example, it is difficult for rank-and-file members to challenge the PTA's position on the issue. PTA convention programs and publications ought to include balanced discussion of the issues.</P>
<P>Indeed, open discussion of parental concerns is virtually absent at state and national PTA meetings. In practice, parents who seek accurate, unbiased information on educational issues are expected to fall in line with PTA positions.</P>
<P>&quot;The PTA severely limits the opportunity for dialogue and dissent,&quot; says Jo Cooper, an Oklahoma parent and 19-year PTA veteran. In 1994, the state legislative chairman of the Oklahoma PTA warned her not to publicly oppose national PTA positions. Cooper's offense? In a public meeting in her suburban Oklahoma City school district, she opposed the national PTA's enthusiastic support of the Goals 2000 legislation and HR 6, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Cooper believes both pieces of federal legislation will undermine local control.</P>
<P>In 1992, Kathy Moran, a PTA official in Villa Park, California, received a letter from the state organization demanding that PTA leaders &quot;do everything possible&quot; to block the gathering of signatures for the 1992 state ballot initiative on school choice. When she tried to organize a debate on the merits of choice, she was told that PTA chapters must present only the anti-choice perspective.</P>
<P><B>What's a Parent to Do?</B></P>
<P>Is it any wonder that a backlash is developing? Small groups of concerned and sometimes angry parents are challenging the status quo&#151;including the PTA's deference to the teachers unions. Among their options:</P>
<P>&#149; <B>Withhold support.</B> Withholding dues to the state and national organizations can be an effective way to protest. At its recent board meeting, the Indiana State PTA lamented that it had to amend its annual budget after losing 3,000 members and their dues.</P>
<P>&#149; <B>Reform from within.</B> Parents who believe the PTA can be reformed from within should form a &quot;parental-control&quot; caucus. Parents committed to pro-parent policies could bring about basic changes in the PTA. With a functioning caucus, they might find the strength to make their voices heard at state and national conventions. They could push to reform cumbersome procedures and restrictive election requirements in order  to elect national PTA officers committed to pro-parent positions.</P>
<P>Of course, for such internal reform to succeed, more parents now dissatisfied with PTA operations would have to become involved.  Like-minded parents need to serve as officers of local chapters and as delegates to state and national conventions. </P>
<P>&#149; <B>Assert leadership locally.</B> In Greenwich, Connecticut, local PTA president Kay Wall questioned the state's implementation of a misnamed &quot;outcome-based education&quot; program in June 1992. Without the support of  the PTA, she organized a protest group, the Committee to Save Our Schools (SOS), which contributed to the collapse of Connecticut's plan.</P>
<P>Within her local PTA chapter, Wall has organized and chairs an Academic Challenge and Excellence Committee (ACE) that focuses on  restoring high academic standards for all children. &quot;They don't really want parents involved in the way I want to be involved,&quot; Wall says,  &quot;which is knowing the details of the curriculum, knowing what is being tested, and questioning the new standards.&quot; Wall is also encouraging members to challenge the PTA's official support of Goals 2000.    </P>
<P>&#153;B7  <B>Revise PTA membership policy.</B> As long as unionized teachers employed under collective bargaining are members of the PTA, it may be futile for parents to criticize educational policy. The NEA's own experience is instructive here. Before the enactment of collective-bargaining laws, the NEA included administrators at the local, state, and national levels. As a result, local NEA chapters were usually unable to promote teachers' interests, and actions of school administrators were seldom criticized.    </P>
<P>&#149; <B>Encourage competition.</B> If parents feel that their PTA cannot represent their interests, they should form alternative organizations. Some active parents are requesting disaffiliation from the national PTA. Janice Thompson, a parent in North Carolina who calls herself a &quot;keeper of the home,&quot; ardently opposes the PTA's social agenda and its close association with teachers unions. Thompson emphasizes the need for parental involvement in academic issues, and feels that PTA affiliation is a hindrance, not a help, to parents who wish to raise academic standards.</P>
<P>To build her case for reverting back to a local parent-teacher organization (PTO), she called the North Carolina State PTA office in Raleigh and asked, &quot;What is the last thing the PTA accomplished in the classroom?&quot; Says Thompson, &quot;They didn't even have an answer.&quot; Last March, parents at her elementary school voted to revert to a PTO. &quot;At the local level,&quot; Thompson says, &quot;we know the issues, and here we can work with parents and the school for the benefit of the students.&quot;</P>
<P>The PTO is organized locally, with no allegiance to state or national associations. Local parents, teachers, and administrators direct the activities, which are not unlike those of the PTA. Governance is usually through simple bylaws, determined by all parents who attend the meetings. It's true, as PTA literature points out, that a PTO does not emphasize lobbying efforts&#151;but such efforts might contradict local standards and parental positions. Members of PTOs have found they can work through the local education maze more easily without the national-policy prohibitions and teachers union allegiances of the PTA.</P>
<P>Activist PTO parents direct their energy toward improving their own schools and their own children's educational opportunities. While many appreciate a PTO's autonomy, some recognize its lack of organizational training and support.</P>
<P>&#149; <B>New opportunities for involvement.</B> Current educational reforms are introducing new ways for parents to become involved in schools. For instance, charter and magnet schools within public-school systems often include provisions for parental involvement similar to requirements at private and parochial schools. School-management companies and for-profit businesses that offer services to public schools often stress active parental involvement. Parents should encourage this trend by insisting that school districts and schools retain the utmost flexibility in contracting for services.</P>
<P>At a time when special-interest groups are increasingly viewed in a negative light, the PTA is already well placed to act as a respected advocate for the educational interests of children and parents. As the</P>
<P>struggle intensifies, the teachers unions will do their utmost to preserve the PTA as their subservient ally. The good news is that parents concerned about education want to do more than attend monthly PTA meetings. They are forming groups and creating procedures that will empower them as consumers of government services.</P>

<P> Millions of American parents concerned about the skyrocketing costs and dismal educational results of government schools cannot count on the PTA as an advocate for their views -- or even as a forum for airing their views.  Instead, national PTA policies, which are automatically adopted as state and local PTA policies, reflect the dominant influence of the teacher unions, especially the National Education Association (NEA).  Consequently, the PTA vigorously opposes any market oriented reform measures opposed by the teacher unions, such as contracting out school management or educational vouchers for parents wishing to send their children to the school of their choice.</P>
<P> Part of PTA's ineffectiveness as a parent advocacy organization is illustrated by a 1968 position statement on &quot;teacher negotiations, sanctions, and strikes.&quot;  The resolution, reaffirmed in 1987, identifies the &quot;dilemmas&quot; that teacher militancy and union negotiations imposes on local PTA members:</P>
<P> <I>&quot;1.  If the PTA provides volunteers to man the classrooms, during a work stoppage, in the interest of protecting the </I><I>immediate safety and welfare of children, it is branded as a strike breaker.&quot; </I></P>

<P> What are PTA members permitted to do?  The resolution urges them to be alert to symptoms of teacher dissatisfaction (abnormal turnover, complaints, and &quot;teacher-supported legislation defeated by state legislature&quot;) before a strike's onset and to promote the public airing of issues.  </P>
<P> In attempting to be &quot;neutral,&quot; on labor and education policy matters that should be of utmost concern to parents, the PTA position clearly defers to the unions.  As a result, PTA places itself outside the arena of debate on education issues regardless of their impact on students, parents or the public.  Clearly, as the PTA's position statement recognizes, a significant threat to the PTA is the teachers' threat to withdraw membership.  Obviously, if such a threat were carried out, it would jeopardize the 60 national PTA staff positions in Chicago and Washington.</P>
<P> That teachers might have the upper hand in the PTA was not apparent at first.  PTA membership, at one million in 1927, began to rise after the Depression and nearly doubled in the five years after the end of World War II.  Membership peaked in 1966 when more than 12 million teachers, administrators, and parents were members of the national PTA.  </P>
<P> While the baby boom was contributing to the increase of parent members in the PTA, teachers were discovering other ways to secure their interests.  Many teachers looked to unions and collective bargaining to achieve higher salaries, job security, and increased benefits,   As early as 1935 the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) had called for collective rather than individual negotiations between teachers and school boards.   Since 1961 NEA has also advocated collective bargaining, although many NEA members feared unionization would lower their professional status.  Notwithstanding, NEA membership has increased in all but four years since a 1978 federal court held that the NEA is a union.  Today, almost 70 percent of America's 3.5 million public school teachers are NEA or AFT members.</P>
<P> PTA activists and officials are often former teachers; state and local PTA presidents are frequently classroom or substitute teachers, many of whom have teacher union backgrounds.  Unfortunately, the alleged absence of demographic data, such as union affiliation, age, and occupation, enables the national PTA to avoid facing the painful facts about who is leading, joining and leaving the organization today.  It also prevents PTA from measuring the differing attitudes of the parents and teachers who comprise the PTA membership.  Although coalitions among the PTA, NEA and AFT are common to shield public education from competition, the teacher union agendas, especially the NEA's have embraced positions on social issues, such as condom availability in the schools, which are anathema to many parents.</P>
<P> Ever since the 1960s, the NEA and AFT have lobbied vigorously for state legislation requiring school boards to bargain collectively with teacher unions over teacher terms and conditions of employment.  Collective bargaining is used in most school districts to resolve such issues as teacher compensation for extra-curricular activities, class size, parent grievance procedures, and frequency and scheduling of parent/teacher conferences.  Paradoxically, collective bargaining laws greatly strengthened the political power of the public sector unions while public accountability has decreased.   As pointed out by Robert S. Summers, Cornell University Professor of Law, public sector collective bargaining &quot;redistributes governmental authority to one major participant - the union - which is not publicly accountable at all for its actions.  Under a bargaining statute, the voters of a school district, for example, do not elect a union, nor can they vote a union &#145;out of office&#146; after it has successfully negotiated a collective bargaining agreement objectionable to the voters.  This particular law-making and budget-creating entity is neither elected by nor accountable to the public.&quot;  </P>
<P> By its refusal to challenge the teacher unions in collective bargaining, the PTA has eliminated itself as an independent advocate for parents.  Despite a policy to &quot;seek to participate in the decision making process establishing school policy,&quot;  PTA cannot compete with the teacher unions as a power broker in educational affairs.  The reality is that if school boards sacrifice parental to teacher interests, as often happens, the PTA cannot and will not object.</P>
<P> In addition to its refusal to challenge the union positions in collective bargaining and teacher strikes, the PTA opposes vouchers and tuition tax credits.  In other words, instead of supporting parental choice in education, the PTA has capitulated to the NEA/AFT position to support public education at all costs.  On May 5, delegates to the 1994 state convention of the California Congress of Parents, Teachers and Students -- also known as the California PTA -- broke into thunderous applause as a speaker congratulated them on defeating the school choice ballot initiative known as Proposition 174.  &quot;You were the voice of the California children!&quot; she shouted.  Over one million California &quot;PTA volunteers defeated Proposition 174; all the California Teachers Association (CTA) did was put up the money.&quot;  Indeed, the CTA spent over $13 million to defeat the measure.  The California PTA had joined the teacher unions in opposing an initiative which would have greatly increased parent power in educational affairs.</P>
<P> PTA volunteers from all corners of California sponsored forums for their anti-voucher message, registered voters, manned telephones, wrote letters to newspapers, and finally, voted overwhelmingly against Proposition 174.  At one workshop a PTA executive reminded delegates that &quot;We will pull the PTA Charter if any unit goes beyond the PTA agenda - as we would have with any PTA that supported vouchers!&quot;</P>
<P> Thirty-six days later, PTA delegates from 53 states and territories representing over 6 million parents and teachers met in Las Vegas for the 98th annual national convention.  With slot machines clanking out quarters in the background, convention delegates participated in two days of workshop training:  How to produce materials that generate positive public reaction to PTA.  How PTAs can respond to extremist groups challenging health/sex education curriculum.  How to implement PTA's, HIV/AIDS awareness programs.  (A $320,000 grant from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention funded an AIDS brochure.)  How to respond to right wing groups favoring school choice.  A Washington, DC legal counsel offered a session to explain the advantages and restrictions on PTA's tax-exempt status as a nonprofit corporation.</P>
<P> Delegates sporting PTA badges, hats, and &quot;PTA Puts Children First&quot; vests considered a number of resolutions.  They dealt with violence in video games, inhalant abuse, the quality of indoor air in portable classrooms, and the sale, resale, and destruction of confiscated firearms.  These are substantially the kind of non-educational, social issues on which NEA and AFT delegates focus at their own national conventions.</P>
<P> Similarly, state PTA convention workshops reinforce the national PTA positions.  Maryland PTA's Vice President for Legislative Activity was criticized by a PTA leader and grandfather from Baltimore for &quot;her hostility in the workshop session&quot; on</P>
<P>privatization.  Several delegates angrily stomped out of the standing-room-only session when the chairwoman refused to permit a balanced discussion of audience views on this issue.  The PTA officer opted instead to ridicule ideas which challenged the inflexibility of PTA's opposition to contracting out school management.  What is the reason for PTA opposition?   Unionized teachers could lose their jobs.  Concern for educational accountability, standards and improvement, and student achievement were missing in the Maryland convention devoted to &quot;PTA Facing Children's Issues.&quot;</P>
<P> Opposing voucher legislation is the No. 1 priority of the New Jersey PTA.  New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman has introduced an extremely limited charter school and tuition voucher pilot program for two grades in the Jersey City schools.  The voucher program would not be available to new schools, which means that it would be several decades before it could have a significant impact on public education.  Nevertheless, as a result of this frightening &quot;threat&quot; to public education, New Jersey PTA delegates voted to &quot;Take an active role in opposing private school vouchers and other legislation which would provide public funds for private schools.&quot;  Not surprisingly, the PTA and the New Jersey Education Association, the NEA affiliate, are part of a coalition to defeat this or any other voucher proposals.  NJEA president Dennis Testa said that the teacher union &quot;has committed $10 million for a two year media and public relations campaign to promote Pride in Public Education.&quot;</P>
<P> Nationally, the liberal left leanings of the PTA were echoed by Senator Edward Kennedy in a recent letter to <I>Education </I><I>Week</I>.  The Democratic Senator praised the National PTA and its affiliate state and local organizations for &quot;generating and reinforcing support for Goals 2000...and the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.&quot;   His letter went on to say, &quot;The PTA played an important role in supporting the nomination of Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders.&quot;  Dr. Elders' was fired in December by President Clinton after she said masturbation &quot;perhaps should be taught.&quot;  She has a lengthy reputation for her support for sex education, condom distribution, and abortion rights.  To urge confirmation of Dr. Elders, PTA officers and lobbyists, as well as members wrote letters of support, phoned members of congress, and promoted Dr. Elders because &quot;PTA shares her views.&quot;  </P>
<P> While PTA leaders share Dr. Elders' views, many PTA parents do not and they are finding it increasingly difficult to articulate their preferences, defend their needs, and lodge their complaints.  Given the way these organizations are governed at the present time, it is virtually impossible to develop independent pro-parent positions on educational choice, contracting out, parent/teacher conference availability, report cards, testing, tenure and other proposals in which parental issues may conflict with teacher union interests.  To do so would require that parents challenge teachers at meetings where both are present.</P>
<P> Because they are subservient to teacher union interests, the PTAs cannot provide parents with a useful role in educational policymaking.  PTA programs are designed to diminish dissatisfaction with poor school performance.  Instead of conducting hearings to expose academic deficiencies, PTAs sponsor events presenting students' best work.  Much time and effort goes into women's auxiliary or support services: trip chaperoning, bake sales, and other fund raising activities.  Good PTA parents are supposed to be supporters, not critics of schools and teachers.  After almost 100 years of existence, the PTA cannot offer even the pretense that it affects basic educational decisions.  </P>
<P> What might be done to make the PTA a better representative for parents?  </P>
<P> *  Leadership at the local level still can make a difference.  In Greenwich, Connecticut, local PTA president Kay Wall questioned state implementation of a misnamed &quot;outcome-based education&quot; (OBE) program in June 1992.  Without the support of the PTA, she organized a protest group, the Committee to Save Our Schools (SOS), which contributed to the collapse of Connecticut's plan.  And within her local PTA chapter, Ms. Wall has organized and chairs an Academic Challenge and Excellence Committee (ACE) that focuses on restoring high academic standards for all children.  She concedes that some members hesitate to challenge in any way the &quot;PTA Position.&quot;  But Ms. Wall warns that Goals 2000, the new federal legislation that PTA strongly supported must be carefully studied.  </P>
<P> *  Another step would be to revise PTA membership policy.  Including unionized teachers employed under collective bargaining procedures within the PTA makes it futile for parents to attempt criticisms of education policy.  The NEA's own experience is instructive here.  Before the enactment of collective bargaining laws, the NEA included administrators as well as teachers at the local, state, and national levels.  The result was that local NEA associations almost invariably were unable to promote teacher interests.  Actions or policies critical of school administrators were seldom discussed.  Likewise, parents need their own organization.  If the PTA is unable to effectively represent parents, new parents' organizations should be established. </P>
<P> *  Ongoing education reform is introducing new ways for parents to become involved in schools.  For instance, charter and magnet schools within public school systems often make provisions for parental involvement.   Citizen (i.e. parent) participation is meant to increase the input of those who are not employees in the schools.  The good news is that parents concerned about education want to do more than attend monthly PTA meetings.  They are forming groups and creating procedures that will empower them as consumers of government services and they are demanding a response from government monopolies.  </P>
<P> The bad news is that as the struggle intensifies, the teacher unions will do their utmost to preserve the PTA as their subservient ally.</P>

<P> Charlene K. Haar clearly shows she does not understand the National PTA.  Here are the facts: Haar implies that the National PTA and the National Education Association, or NEA, are similar types of organizations in terms of membership, funding and mission.  The fact is that the NEA is a union , designed to work on behalf of the economic self-interest of its members, whereas the National PTA is a grassroots, volunteer, private, nonprofit organization with an annual budget of less than $6 million.  Our 6.7 million members work on behalf of the best interests of all children on issues that affect their health, education and welfare.</P>
<P> Haar alleges that National PTA policies reflect the influence of the NEA.  However, since a majority of the board must approve every national position statement and resolution adopted by our organization, it would be nearly impossible for the NEA or other teachers unions to affect the outcome of the vote.  It is not true, as is sometimes alleged, that National PTA policies are adopted automatically as state and local PTA policies.  No state is compelled to adopt, in part or in entirety, any national position statement or resolution.  Each state PTA office is separately incorporated and is autonomous.  For example, local PTA President Kay Wall in Greenwich Conn., is working within here chapter to restore high academic standards even though she views her work as a challenge to a PTA position.</P>
<P> In fact, at its most recent meeting in January, the National PTA created a position statement that reads in part, &#147;Challenging and precise standards must be developed which objectively measure achievement in academic areas, no just minimal standards that reduce student achievement to the lowest common denominator, but standards to achieve the highest levels possible.&#148;</P>
<P> According to Haar, the National PTA&#146;s recommendation for local PTA&#146;s to remain neutral during a strike makes the organization subservient to unions.  Neutrality and independence, however, give PTA its greatest strengths during a strike.  PTA offers a forum for public debate of the issues dividing school boards and teachers.  When public debate is not forthcoming, PTA members become legislative activists.  In December 1994, the PTA council in Anchorage, Alaska, resolved &#147;actively to seek and support changes to state legislation and regulations which allow for public disclosure and a reasonable time for public comment on all issues being considered between the bargaining group and school board.&#148;</P>
<P> The federal government recognizes us as a reliable and unbiased source of ideas about ways to improve the relationship between school boards and unions.  On January 10, I testified before a special committee of the Labor Department on ways to improve labor-management relations in public education.  Our opinion was sought because our members represent the &#147;customers&#148; -- children and parents -- in the education market.</P>
<P> Additionally, state PTAs are free to adopt their own policies regarding strikes.  To quote from the Jan. 12 edition of the <I>Cincinnati Enquirer</I>, &#147;Gathering membership among teachers can be difficult because the PTA and teachers sometimes are on opposite sides of issues...  For instance, the Ohio PTA is against teacher strikes.  &#129;91`The PTA&#146;s major concern is the child, and there are times that the PTA&#146;s concern takes precedence over what other employee groups might see as priority,&#146; said Louis Benjamin, president of the Valley Area PTA Council.&#148;</P>
<P> Does the National PTA defer to teachers for fear of losing their membership dues? Clearly not.  The 75 cents the National PTA collects from each member does not begin to cover the broad array of services, programs, awards and publications the PTA produces.  Instead, we look to cooperative agreements with other child-advocacy organizations, corporate contributors and private foundations to provide the balance of our budgetary requirements.  Without their generous financial support and in-kind contributions of supplies, services and expertise, we would not be so successful in meeting our members&#146; needs.</P>
<P> Even if we took the &#147;T&#148; out of PTA, teachers would still join our organization.  We base that belief on the turnout for our first meeting in 1897, when educators, social reformers, fathers and mothers came together with a common purpose -- to improve the health, education and welfare of all children.  Teachers care about children, and many teachers are parents themselves.  They join the PTA to make a positive difference.</P>
<P> Haar alleges that PTA activists are former teachers with union backgrounds, yet she admits the absence of demographic data to back her claim.  National PTA does not track the demographics of its general membership because it&#146;s immaterial to what we do ask -- that everyone involved with the PTA, whether at the local, state or national level, be dedicated to putting the needs and concerns of children first in everything they do. </P>
<P> True, the National PTA partners with organizations on a variety of issues to address a specific need from a broad perspective.  Such cooperation in no way constitutes a blanket endorsement of the partner organization&#146;s positions.  The National PTA consistently has been a leader for innovative approaches to schooling that will open up quality public education to all children.  In California, for example, the PTA has been a vocal proponent of parental choice in education through the creation of charter and magnet schools, interdistrict transfers and other programs.  We consistently have advocated that public tax dollars should pay only for public-school initiatives -- not be siphoned off to support privately funded institutions.</P>
<P> Does the PTA&#146;s stance on collective bargaining percent it from serving as an effective advocate for parents?  The fact is that the National PTA does not have a resolution or policy statement regarding collective bargaining by teachers unions.  We have repeatedly called for appropriate funding authorities to establish salaries commensurate with the professional preparation and dedication necessary for effective teaching.</P>
<P> It is not true, as has been alleged, that the National PTA favors teacher interests over parental ones.  In fact, we urge our members to stay on top of all school-board issues and to participate actively in policy-making decisions.  As I testified before the Labor Department committee, &#147;We encourage local PTA representatives to attend all school-board meetings and report on issues to the rest of the members.  In return, PTAs can and do host administrators and board members at their meetings, opening up the lines of communication to the community and building a relationship among the constituents the schools are designed to serve...  PTA&#146;s  must involve themselves beginning at the local level on questions of curriculum development, achievement standards and budget allocations.  And they must participate as members of advisory committees and site-based management teams.  We train our members of advisory committees and site-based management teams.  We train our members to be effective advocates at the national, state and grassroots levels so that their participation..  is meaningful.&#148;</P>
<P> It has been argued that the National PTA&#146;s objection to using tuition tax credits and vouchers to fund education is because we have &#147;capitulated to the NEA/AFT.&#148; Not true.  The National PTA developed its position on tuition tax credits and vouchers independently in 1979.  The board reaffirmed the position in 1991.  The National PTA believes that using public money to pay for private education will reduce the already meager funds available to public schools.  We believe the public-education system is fundamental to teaching the tenets of government and democracy on which our country is based.  It also is a vital means of preparing every child to compete on an equal footing in the world marketplace.</P>
<P> Diverting public dollars to private institutions deprives children and families of equal access to a quality education and deepens the disparity between those who are well-equipped to function in society and those who are not.  Hobbling our citizens by denying them a quality education ultimately will have a detrimental effect on the productivity of our society as a whole.</P>
<P> Is it a cause for alarm that the vast array of workshops and programs available to parents at our convention address issues outside of the educational field? While it is true that the PTA generally is considered in connection with schools, it is an independent organization with a broad mission that includes, but certainly isn&#146;t limited to, educational issues.  We also address health and welfare issues including child nutrition, immunization, parent-child communication, TV violence, conflict resolution and a host of other issues vital to our members&#146; interest.</P>
<P> It has been charged that the PTA has &#147;liberal-left leanings&#148; because it supported the nomination of Joycelyn Elders as surgeon general.  But the National PTA qualified its support of Elders from the outset.  In an August 1993 letter to the National PTA board, I wrote, &#147;The National PTA does not endorse all of the controversial statements made by Dr. Elders.  PTA support is based solely on here efforts to increase the level of health services going to children and families.&#148; We stand by that statement.</P>
<P> Haar notes that &#147;education reform is introducing new ways for parents to become involved in schools.&#148;  She neglects to explain that it was largely the work of the National PTA that won unprecedented bipartisan support for goal eight of Goals 2000 -- the goal that calls for &#147;every school [to] promote partnerships that will increase parental involvement and participation in promoting the social, emotional, and academic growth of children.&#148;  The National PTA and Sen. Mark Hatfield, and Oregon Republican, drafted the language for goal eight.  It was opposed initially by the Bush and Clinton administrations, as well as by the NEA.  Ultimately, the tireless efforts of 10 Democratic and 12 Republican senators saw the goal included and passed with the rest of the Educate America Act that became law on March 31, 1994.</P>
<P> In light of the discrepancy between Haar&#146;s article and the facts, it&#146;s important to note that recently the press has received some scrutiny and criticism about unfair practices.  It is not unheard of for some who write the news to slate the information they&#146;ve gathered to skew the reader&#146;s perception.  Journalists may be bringing their own agendas to an interview and have a preconceived idea of the outcome.</P>
<P> We find it strange that our organization, the only purpose of which, for almost 100 years, has been to improve the well-being of all children, is suddenly called to task for working cooperatively with other organizations that share some similar goals.  What proof does Haar offer that there is some sinister plot behind parents and teachers working together to better the quality of education for all children?  Insinuation and innuendo are the tools of those who have little to offer in the way of substance to argue their case.  Perhaps the author would attend a few local unit meetings so that she could see, firsthand, how deeply the parents there care about what&#146;s happening to their children&#146;s schools.  Perhaps she would understand even better the concerns of those parents who know that the dollars are not available to do everything they want done.  So parents roll up their sleeves and get the job done by fighting for a fair share of local budgets by laughing school bond initiatives, raising the awareness of the community and gaining broad support for the schools.  In the process, the National PTA cooperates with many partners but is subservient to none.</P>
<P> We hope our work reminds Americans of a premise upon which our country was founded -- that education is the key to advancement.  It is the right of every child in the United States to have access to free, high-quality education.  We invite all citizens to join us as we work to put children first on the nation&#146;s list of priorities.</P>
