Today I continued the lesson Stacey and Eric had spontaneously started yesterday that went fantastically!  We were planning on focusing this week on the water cycle and pollution but everything has been pushed back to encompass this activity that the kids went after so wholeheartedly.  The kids each chose an animal they wanted to be.  They performed some research on the Internet, but Stacey, Eric and I thought it would be a good idea to give them more time in the school library - so that's what I did!<BR>
They worked very well together and independently in the library and I was very proud of them.  I was also very pleased to find that I harbored no remaining disappointment about my failed lesson on Wednesday.  It was as if walking into that room on the brand new morning gave us all a brand new slate to work upon.  It was definitely a feeling that I liked.<P>

Met Eric early to go over the lesson plan for today.  We talked to Tyna and the students are ready to review today and take the written portion of the midterm tomorrow.  That would have been wonderful, but...they never showed today at SUNY.  Eric, Melissa and I waited for 45 minutes.  Melissa called Gouverneur and the secretary said that 
they didn't have a bus for the day.<P>

I was so excited about today.  I really had a chance to explore some techniques Iwould like to use in my own class.  I performed the experiment "Deadly Skies", and Mrs. French was a supreme help in the very first part of this experiment.  She planted paper towels soaked with vinegar all over the room.  Unfortunately the vinegar dissipated 
very quickly and only a few of the kids noticed the smell.  We talked about air pollution and how easy it was to clean our environment of the vinegar towels, but it is not so easy to clean a habitat being destroyed by acid rain.  <BR>
The kids helped me design a concept map about acid precipitation.  We discussed the activity (planting seeds so we could water one tin with water, and one with vinegar) and came up with three hypotheses about what would happen to the tin watered with vinegar.  They helped me design a chart we could use to record our observations.  We will actually be viewing the effect of an acid on a habitat over a period of time.<BR>
I practiced more of a lecture procedure but incorporated quite a bit of student participation through the concept map and development of the hypotheses.  I felt very good about the activity.  After we finished talking, I had the students record the concept map in their notebooks as well as copy the chart we had all designed.  I am not sure if I handled that correctly.  I probably should have had them copying as we 
went along, but I was a bit afraid of losing their train of thought.  I think I could have done it while they were recording and not worried so much about it.<BR>
We planted the seeds and then went up to the library and finished the research they need for Wednesdays lesson.  Today was definitely a good day with quite a bit of thought provoking results.  I would like to incorporate more of this type of teaching in my class.  I used the chalkboard, but I would prefer an overhead.  I wasn't real comfortable 
having to turn my back on them even for the seconds it took me to record a statement on the board.<P>

I'm so happy with the results of the lab practical.  Kate did awesome!  I knew she could do it.  Every member of my team did well and I knew they could do it.  I'm going to continue to tell them how good they're doing.  I've got the same good feeling about the written part. <P>


I have a good group of students.  I'm going to miss them during the next river visits.<P>


I e-mailed Dr. Doody regarding my culminating experience, midterm grades and lesson plans for the week.  Tyna and I are going to try to get an appointment on Thursday to talk with him about the Culminating Experience.  Has this project ever gotten gigantic.<P>

I missed Friday, the kids were at the Canton farm and I couldn't make it.  Today was a good day.  Last Monday we focused on acid rain and air pollution.  This week we wanted to focus a bit more on water pollution itself.  The kids helped me design another concept map, this one for water pollution.  The concept map listed all four major types and I had them help give me as much detail as possible.  I notice even more today how much I dislike using the chalkboard.  I intensely dislike having my back to the kids.  I do like using overheads.  Perhaps next time I have a lesson which involves designing a concept map or a brainstorming session in which I want the kids to record 
information I will use an overhead!<BR>
After we finished with that, I had them split into two groups depending on their interests.  One group would draw pictures which described things that could be done to keep the water clean - aid against pollution, and the other group had to come up with a contract which they will sign that clearly states their intentions to fight against pollution.  The kids got off to a slow start with this one but eventually got into it.  I am wondering if we are not bogging them down with all these pollution concepts. They remarked to me that they could do nothing - basically they were powerless.  I attempted to convince them otherwise and I think I achieved that goal somewhat, 
but it is from this that my worries stem.<P>

Mike and the students can't come to SUNY on Wednesdays anymore.  Eric and I are planning to go there but couldn't today.  I guess they can only get the bus on Wednesday for a river visit since they are already coming to SUNY every Thursday.  Tyna went but said things didn't go well.  She didn't have time to elaborate.  She was on her way 
to a class.<P>

The kids have Friday off this week so I came in today to make up for it.  I took them to the computer lab and had them type in their stories about the animal they chose.  It went really well!  I had a really good time and they seemed to enjoy the change. I noticed that many of them have a difficult time typing - I am not sure if this is due to the lack of a typing class in their background or if they simply don't get typing.  I had one of the students challenge me that I could not type as fast as I wanted him to type.  I love nothing more than a challenge!  I didn't bother to warn him that I had been a licensed computer processor for 5 years.  I typed the next sentence in his story in a matter of seconds and just as quickly erased it so he would have to do it himself.  I sort of enjoyed watching his face take on a look of pure astonishment! 
 He became a bit frustrated in the end and I ended up helping him type in the remainder of his story to keep him on track with the others, but I didn't mind.  <BR>
The kids have been very lighthearted with me, teasing me quite a bit, always quick to apologize if they believe for a minute they have actually hurt my feelings.  Another teacher assured me that the students only really pick on the teachers they truly like.  I suppose I can take their ribbing as a compliment - just as long as that is what 
it means!<P>

I finished 2 classroom activities on Thursday: Why We Test Water and the Incredible Journey - Biology Group.  They are up on the Web as soon as Dr. Doody drops the folder in.  I also typed up several of my journal entries.  I wrote a note to Dr. Doody regarding my journals.  I wanted to know if I should edit my journals more.  I am including students names which concerns me.  I am only saying positive things generally, but 
I wasn't sure if I should include the names.  He said the entries looked good.<P>


The students were good Thursday.  Brandon and Gina were absent.  The lesson went well and we extended it until the end of next week.  Tyna is going to continue researching with them on Friday and start the acid rain lesson on Monday.  When Eric and I go to Gouverneur on Wednesday, they should be ready to start writing their stories.<P>


They loved going to the SWAMP.  Mike and Mrs. French joined us.  They seemed pleased with our lesson and the student involvement. They also seemed to like the MAC lab.<P>


The students have such different responses when asked to take notes.  Most don't want to for whatever reason, except Charity.  By the time we left the MAC lab, she must have had 1-11/2 pages of notes.<P>


They all tried to find out information about the species they picked by performing Net Searches.  Some had more luck than others.  I wished we had more than 30 min. Eric and I need to work on the rubric for the short story.  I'd like to give it out before they start writing.<P>

I talked with Dr. Doody today.  He is happy with the journal entries I sent him.  I explained that I put up the Biology Group Incredible Journey stories and that Tyna had given me them instead of the Chem group stories.  She will do them.  It is the same amount of work for both. <P>


Eric and I will have 55 minutes at Gouverneur on Wednesdays.  That will give me time to teach another Intro Biology Lab at SUNY.<P>

Eric and I discussed our lesson on the trip over.  We had to make some changes as a result of what was accomplished on Monday.<P>


Boy was it wild at the middle school today.  Mike had so much going on that he didn't have any time to talk with us.  Something was up.<P>


Our students were "up".  Erica's sister is in the hospital waiting to have her baby.  Everyone was excited.<P>


Jen and Erica have good first drafts done and worked on typing up their stories. Charity had an awesome draft mostly done.  She has excellent habitat detail.  Kate kept her original species, the northern pike.  She has a good picture but needs to research more detail about the habitat.  Brandon is in the midst of his weasel story.  Steven is Flip the fox and he's also in the midst of his draft.  Andy is pretty much in the same situation.  Gina has picked the beaver but she is not here today.<P>


They know they need to cometo SUNY tomorrow with their drafts done.  We will start working on their posters for our bulletin board project.  There seem to be many questions about acid rain so I'm going to put together a worksheet for tomorrow.<P>


Eventually we're going to have the stories typed for the bulletin board and the Web. <P>



We gave them the rubric for how they are being graded.  Hope that will help them. 
  <P>

The students worked on their short stories and posters today.  Brandon and Andy drew great scenes.  Jennifer and Erica are working together and combining their species: cottontail and raccoon on one poster.  Steven is the red fox.  Charity and Kate are working together on one poster also.  They are doing the snapping turtle and northern pike.  Brandon is doing the weasel and Andy is doing the white-tailed deer.  Gina is still doing the beaver.<P>

We collected their rough drafts today and split them to read and make comments.  We're faxing them to Gouverneur tomorrow so the students can work on them.  We should ask Mike to fax them back (corrections made) by Tuesday.  We could have typed copies and final grades when we see them on Wednesday.<P>


We had the Halloween party thanks mainly to Donna and it was great.  A friend of mine dressed up in a ghost-like costume and the students went crazy.  They swarmed around her and kept trying to find out who she was.  They thought she was Tyna.  At least some did.  Kate even thought it might be Dr. Doody.    I finally told my group that they had seen her in the MAC lab when we had been there.  Andy's eyes got big.  He knew that she was the woman who had sat in back of him.  He appeared amazed.<P>

Talked to Tyna and asked her to collect the short stories and fax them to me.  Eric and I wanted to grade them, type them up and give  them  back.  Most of the students had finished typing their stories by the time class with Tyna was over yesterday so they will be waiting for us tomorrow.<P>


I'm making up a review sheet, a crossword puzzle to tie up water canaries, pH and acid rain effects.<P>

We were at Gouverneur today.  We only had Jen, Charity and Andy today.  Erica had strep throat.  Kate and Steven were in Band.  Jen and Charity finished their posters. They worked from photos I brought in.  They did an excellent job!  Jen drew and colored in the cottontail for Erica.  She's a great kid and always eager to help.<P>



We have posters and stories up for Jen, Charity, Andy and Steven.  They are in the hall by their classroom.<P>

The students were good yesterday.  They shared their stories.  We probably should have put the grades on them after  they had read them.  However, they ahd comments on their drafts and if they chose not to take our suggestions, they didn't get as high a grade as they could have.  When writing an acid rain story, one must talk about acid rain.  Overall, the stories were very good.  I was pleased.<P>


Tyna said that she tried to get them to make the changes Tuesday.  What else can you do?<P>


The students are working on the acid rain crossword puzzle.  Some weren't too happy that it wasn't easy.  Oh well.  They should know it wouldn't be easy.   How could it be challenging if it were easy.  I want them to THINK!  They are capable of so much but some don't believe they are.  Sometimes I just want to yell at them that they are smart, so smart.  There is not a one who can't get A's in this course.  But, motivation seems to be a problem often.  We've tried many things.  I just think it must be hard to have so many teachers.  So many personalities to try to figure out.<P>


We will be taking them on a field trip to the Quant. lab at SUNY in December to perform heavy metal testing on our water samples.  We should be able to do mass spec and atomic absorption.  Dr. Hepel was so interested.  Can't wait.<P>

Mike had to cancel the field trip to Cranberry Lake this morning.   He tried to reach all of us but couldn't get Eric and Rita.  They drove to Cranberry Lake.  Oh no. Apparently only 3 of 16 students came prepared for the cold.  He had no choice. I'm pretty sure that after this afternoon with him, they had wished they were prepared.<P>


We will have to find out when this trip will be rescheduled, if at all.  We are running out of weeks.<P>


Eric and I talked to Mike after our afternoon seminar and explained to him that because the students weren't prepared for today, we are not prepared to put together another lesson for tomorrow.  Our lessons when we visit the river span 2 days (Wed and Thurs).  We decided that since Wed. was cancelled so would Thursday.  Eric and I didn't want to make the call for the Biology group though.  We tried to reach Donna but could only leave a message on her machine.  He could still bring the biology team but that would probably not be feasible.  Eric is going to call Melissa and Rita.  I'll get in touch with Donna and Tyna.<P>

<DD>     <DD>     They will learn that plants serve many important functions within the ecosystem. 
<DD>     <DD>      Also, the students will learn to discern between various aspects of plant structure- 
<DD>     <DD>     leaf texture, leaf arrangement, stem type and presence of certain "other" structures (pistil, stamen, etc..). <BR><BR>

<DD>     <DD>       Either at the site, or on school grounds, the students will choose ten <STRONG>different </STRONG>
<DD>     <DD>     leaves.  This activity is adapted from the activity "Leaf Impressions" found on the 
<DD>     <DD>     World Wide Web at the URL address:       http://207.22.231.50:80/nsta_scripts/List_SSC_byGrade.idc 
<DD>     <DD>      <BR>
<DD>     <DD>     In their journals, they will draw a picture of the leaf, depicting it as accurately 
<DD>     <DD>     as possible.  Along with the drawing, a short description of the plant it came from 
<DD>     <DD>     must be given.  The students will then put the leaves between wax paper, iron them, and keep them in their journal.  This will provide them with a comparison of a variety of leaf types.  After this is finished, the field guide classification will begin. 
The student must identify, correctly, the type of plant the leaf came from.  The information used will be taken from the journal descriptions and leaf characteristics (one or two 45 minute periods).<BR><BR>

<DD>     <DD>     each leaf, a class discussion will ensue.  This talk will contain such information 
<DD>     <DD>     as to why they classified the plant where they did, and what certain characteristics 
<DD>     <DD>     were used to lead them to their conclusion (30 minutes).<BR>
<DD>     <DD>     A brainstorming session will follow, and the students must say what they think the 
<DD>     <DD>     plants are used for and how important they believe them to be.  The purpose of this 
<DD>     <DD>     is to allow the students to generate ideas on their own, and give them the opportunity to express their own thinking and beliefs (10-15 minutes).<BR><P>

<DD>     <DD>      Cranial creation #42, from <CITE>Cranial Creations in Life Science</CITE> by Downing and Miller, p.170 will be performed .  This activity is designed to bring all that has been studied on this topic before into one experience.  It is a good way for the teacher to actually measure the amount of learned material for each student.  They will work in groups of two, and create a cartoon which relates the importance of plants to the ecosystem.  Four words are chosen from the free association conducted on day two and incorporated into the cartoon.  Again, the students should be encouraged to derive their own ideas.  Therefore, a vague idea or description is acceptable (45 minutes).

<DD>     <DD>     <BR>
<DD>     <DD>     <I><B><!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=4><!-- Font Tag --><FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">Pedagogy:</FONT></FONT> </B></I> This lesson concentrates on the introduction of new species into a previously uninhabited area.  They proliferate to such an extent that they upset the naturally maintained balance and virtually chokes out other indigenous species.  This occurs because of the increased competition the invasive species creates for the habitat, and because the native species originally there is unable to adapt so quickly, they die.  The two main invasive species we will be devoting the most study to, is the zebra mussel and purple loosestrife.  There are others, such as the carp, eel, trout, and the alewife, but the zebra mussel and the purple loosestrife are the most recent, with a the greatest impact, causing much debate in this area.  We are expecting to find the presence of these species in the Oswegatchie River.<BR><BR>
<DD>     <DD>     
<DD>     <DD>     <EM><B><!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=4><!-- Font Tag --><FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">Phase 1:</FONT></FONT></B></EM>
<DD>     <DD>       The journals will be submitted for a final grading.  <BR>
<DD>     <DD>     The students will be asked what words they would associate with exotic and rare.  From the words they provide, a definition for them will be constructed.  Then, they will be asked if any exotic species were found at the sites along the Oswegatchie River.  If so, field guides will be used in classifying them.  Research will entail, in which the students use an encyclopedia to determine the origin of that species.  Finally, the students will chart and illustrate possible migration routes on unlined paper.  These will be submitted to the teacher for evaluation (45 minutes).  <BR>
<DD>     <DD>     Homework:  The students must do research to devise a list of exotic species in the Oswegatchie River.<BR><BR>

<DD>     <DD>     <EM><B><!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=4><!-- Font Tag --><FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">Phase 2:</FONT></FONT></B></EM>
<DD>     <DD>   The activity "Aquatic Roots" from <CITE>Project Aquatic </CITE> p.100 will be completed.  The information gathered will include the origin of the invasive species and its impacts on the area.  They will list the benefits and liabilities provided for the environment (40 minutes).  An oral report to the class will be required, reporting upon their findings.  The oral will be very informal, 2-3 minutes in length.    Homework:  The students will write a reflective experience, in which they comment on the amount of learned material, the enjoyment out of it, methods of teaching, and whether they liked the class or not.<BR><BR>

<DD>     <DD>       Finally,  the exotic species impact will end with a class discussion of the economic costs of them, and possible solutions on how to terminate, or control them (15-20 minutes).  Teacher evaluations will be handed out and the students are welcome to comment upon the class outline and content (20 minutes).

<dt><A NAME="11A9">9</a>.	<I>EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (EAP)</I></a>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="11A9a">a</a>)	Purpose
<dt><br>
			<dt>The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is a confidential referral program which offers assistance to employees to cope with personal problems which negatively affect their lives and which might intrude upon their jobs.  Emotional stress, family disintegration, financial and legal difficulties, alcoholism, drug abuse and marital disruption impair not only an employee's personal life, but workplace productivity.  EAP was formed with the knowledge that such problems can be addressed and treated with appropriate help.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="11A9b">b</a>)	Service Provided
<dt><br>
<dt>EAP is a confidential information, support and referral service.  It is not a counseling service, nor does it provide treatment.  Using the referral services of EAP is not a condition of employment.  Depending upon the nature of the problem, employees seeking assistance are referred to a program, service or agency within the community for appropriate counseling or assistance.
<dt><br>
<Dt>Involvement in this program is entirely voluntary and services of EAP are free of charge.  Employee benefits may cover the expenses of other referral agencies.
<dt><br>
<dt>The SUNY Potsdam EAP office is located in Morey Hall, Room 105.  Employees calling EAP are not restricted to Potsdam coordinators.  Any EAP coordinator from any state agency can be contacted.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="11A9c">c</a>)	Eligibility And Referral
<dt><br>
			<dt>The EAP is open to all College and PACES employees, retirees and their families.  An employee may enter EAP through self- referral, supervisor referral, or a third party (family member, union representative, friend, co-worker, clergy, etc.)
<dt><br>
<dt>It is important to remember that the final decision to contact the Employee Assistance Program lies with the employee.  EAP is a voluntary option.

		<dt>All employees are expected to have an identification card.  Sometime prior to the beginning of employment, you should visit the I.D. Office, Thatcher Hall, for the purpose of having an I.D. card made.
<dt><br>
<dt>In addition to providing identification for security of buildings and facilities purposes, an I.D. card provides access to the use of College facilities, such as Maxcy Hall and Crumb Library.
<dt><br>
		<dt>The I.D. Office is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and no appointment is necessary.  There is no cost for the initial I.D. card, however, if the card is lost, a fee will be charged for the replacement.

<dt><A NAME="11A16"><i>15</a>.	PUBLIC SAFETY</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Public Safety at SUNY Potsdam consists of a team of people working with the campus community to create a safe environment in which to live, work, and learn.  The department is primarily service-oriented, created to meet the specialized needs of a College campus.  The work of the department includes crime prevention and control, criminal investigations, traffic and parking supervision, physical plant security, emergency first aid treatment, the maintenance of public order and other related activities.
<dt><br>
<dt>The officers of the department are responsible for the enforcement of all state and local laws as well as rules and regulations of the College.  The department's ability to function as an independent law enforcement agency enables it to provide a sensitive, measured approach to all situations requiring police assistance while still maintaining the autonomy of the University.
<dt><br>
<dt>Public Safety officers are peace officers as designated in Section 2.20 of the Criminal Procedure Law.  This section basically gives Public Safety Officers the authority to make arrests, conduct criminal investigations, issue Uniform Traffic Tickets, execute warrants and issue summonses for parking, as well as enforce any general, special or local law or charter, rule, regulation, judgment or order.
<dt><br>
<dt>As Peace Officers, Public Safety Officers receive 16 weeks of training at the Public Safety Basic Training Academy in Albany.  This training is mandated by the Bureau for Municipal Police and is in compliance with that established by the Municipal Police Training Council. 
<dt><br>
		<dd>Some of the services provided the College campus are:
<dt><br>
			<dd>- render emergency first aid when necessary
<dt><br>
			<dd>- assist motorists with minor problems or call for service if   necessary
<dt><br>
			<dd>- open doors in emergency situations and within College policy guidelines

<dt><br>
		<dt>It is the policy of the College to provide the most efficient and economical telecommunications system possible to support the operations of the College.  Telephone service is provided to the College community by an AT&T Definity G3R telephone switch.  Voice Mail is provided by an AT&T AUDIX System.
<dt><br>
<dt>The College presently utilizes AT&T as our long distance carrier.  This carrier requires the use of a seven digit authorization code to complete long distance, international and information calls.  Authorization codes are available from the office of Distributed Computing/Telemedia.    Personal authorization codes are available upon request, but require a supervisor's approval.  A supervisor may, at his/her discretion, restrict certain phones to campus or campus and local calls, only.
<dt><br>
<dt>Faculty and staff may request personal authorization codes by completing a Telephone/Network Services Request form.  This code will allow the individual to make personal calles from work and be charged for these calls.
<dt><br>
<dt>Our local calling area consists of the following exchanges:  262; 265; 267; 268; 322; 328; 353; 379 and 386.
<dt><br>
<dt>The telephone system is coordinated through the Office of Distributed Computing/Telemedia.  Please direct any questions regarding phone service to Brenda Bennett at extension 3000. 
<dt><br>
<dt>The following is a brief description of our most commonly used dialing patterns:

<dt><br>
		<dd>On-Campus Calls:	Dial the last four digits.<br>
		<dd>(Includes Students)      
<dt><br>
		<dd>800 Calls:			Dial 9, then 1-800 and the last seven digits of the 800 number you are dialing. Authorization codes are not required to place 800 calls.
<dt><br>

The President of the College, after seeking consultation, may appoint, reappoint, or recommend to the Chancellor for appointment or reappointment such persons as are, in his/her judgment, best qualified.  Such appointments shall be consistent with the operating requirements of the College.  The term "consultation" means consideration of recommendations of academic or professional employees, including the committees, if any, of the appropriate department or professional area, and other appropriate sources in connection with appointment or reappointment of a specified employee.  Normally, such consultation consists of consideration of the recommendation of the employee's (as appropriate) department, chairperson or immediate supervisor, Dean, and Vice President.

 <Dt>All persons (full or part-time) teaching a credit-bearing course must be affiliated with the College.  Affiliation may be effected through a recommendation by the appropriate department and/or Dean, the Provost, and approval by the President for a regular, secondary, adjunct, courtesy or casual appointment on the academic staff.  This policy applies to any credit-bearing course offered during the regular session, summer session and extension programs.
<DT><BR>

			<dt>A probationary appointment is an appointment for a period of one year which must be granted to a professional employee holding a professional title in which permanent appointment may be granted when he/she is appointed to a different professional title in which permanent appointment may be granted or to a professional title requiring a five-year term appointment.

<dt>d)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Continuing Appointment">Continuing Appointment</A>
<dt><br>
			<dt>A continuing appointment is an appointment made to a position of academic rank which is not affected by changes in such rank and continues until resignation, retirement, or termination.  Continuing appointments are made by the Chancellor on recommendation of the President.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Continuing appointment as Professor, Associate Professor, Librarian, or Associate Librarian may be given on initial appointment or thereafter.  Further employment in such ranks after the third consecutive year of service in any one of these ranks at the College must be on the basis of continuing appointment, however, such appointment is not effective until made so by the Chancellor.
<dt><br>               
			<dt>Promotion to any of the above listed ranks does not extend the service requirements for continuing appointment in all other ranks in which such appointment may be granted.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Further employment of an employee who has completed a total of seven years of service in a position or positions of academic rank of which the last three consecutive years have been in a position of academic rank at the College as Assistant Professor, Instructor, Senior Assistant Librarian, or Assistant Librarian must be on the basis of continuing appointment, however, such appointment is not effective until made so by the Chancellor.  An employee in such positions is not eligible for continuing appointment at any of these ranks prior to the completion of a total of seven years in a position or positions of academic rank.
<dt><br>
			<dt>In computing consecutive years of service for the purposes of continuing appointment to the academic staff, periods of leave of absence at partial salary or without salary and periods of part- time service shall not be included, but shall not be deemed an interruption of otherwise consecutive service.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Satisfactory full-time prior service in academic rank at any other accredited academic institution of higher education may, at the request of the employee and in the discretion of the President (or designee), be credited as service, up to a maximum of three years, toward continuing appointment as Assistant Professor, Instructor, Senior Assistant Librarian or Assistant Librarian.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl> 
		<dt>e)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Permanent Appointment">Permanent Appointment</A>
<dt><br>
			<dt>A permanent appointment is an appointment of a faculty member to a professional title, except those professional titles requiring five-year term appointment, which continues until a change in such title, resignation, retirement, or termination.  Permanent appointments are made by the Chancellor on recommendation of the President.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Further employment, in a professional title in which permanent appointment may be granted, of a professional employee who has completed seven consecutive years of full-time service as a professional employee at the College, the last two of which have been in that professional title must be on the basis of permanent appointment, however, such appointment is not effective until made so by the Chancellor.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Upon completion of three consecutive years of full-time services as a professional employee at the College, the last year of which has been in that professional title, a professional employee in the first four salary ranks may request early consideration for permanent appointment.  Such request must be in writing and submitted to the President of the College no later than nine months prior to the date upon which such employee would otherwise receive written notice that a term appointment is not to be renewed upon expiration.  In the event the President of the College grants the employee's request for such early consideration, any further employment of that employee after completion of five consecutive years of full-time services as a professional employee at that College, the last two years of which have been in that professional title, must be on the basis of permanent appointment; provided, however that such appointment shall not be effective until made so by the Chancellor.
<dt><br>
			<dt>In computing consecutive years of service for the purpose of permanent appointment of professional employees, periods of leave of absence at full salary and periods of full-time service in probationary and temporary appointments shall be included; periods of leave of absence at partial salary or without salary and periods of part-time service shall not be included but shall not be deemed an interruption of consecutive service.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Satisfactory full-time prior service in a professional title  covered by the Agreement at any one college of the University may, at the request of the professional employee and in the discretion of the President (or designee) be credited as service, up to a maximum of three years, toward permanent appointment.

Such employees are given "CSL" titles, and are not subject to agency shop fee deduction, nor entitled to negotiated salary increases or minimums.  Casual employees are compensated in some manner other than basic annual salary (i.e., biweekly, hourly, fee for service, or per diem), with full payment generally made during the course of the contractual period.

		<dt>i)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Secondary Appointment">Secondary Appointment</A>
<dt><br>     
			<dt>In order to encourage cross-fertilization among disciplines, and particularly across department lines, SUNY Potsdam has established a system of secondary appointments, whereby members of other departments are invited to participate in the work of a second department for a limited period without voting powers.  Secondary appointments of this kind are established under the following guidelines:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>i)	at the request of a faculty member seeking a joint appointment, such appointment shall be initiated by the Dean of the School in which the faculty member has his/her primary appointment.  That Dean shall consult with the Dean of the School in which the secondary appointment is proposed.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>ii)	the Dean of the second School shall consult with the department in which the appointment is sought and shall report that recommendation and his/her own recommendation to the Provost.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>iii)	the Provost shall consult with the Deans and with the President.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>iv)	the President shall approve or disapprove the joint appointment and shall notify the applicant in writing of his/her decision.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>               
			<dt>v)	a secondary appointment in a department other than the faculty member's home department does not create continuing appointment rights in the secondary department.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>vi)	secondary appointments will be for a fixed term, normally of three years, and will be renewable.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>vii)	a secondary appointment entitles the individual in question to attend meetings of his/her secondary department without voting privileges.  The appointee has no teaching obligations, and such appointments are without salary.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>     
			<dt>viii)	individuals with secondary appointments may cross-list their courses with their secondary departments and, upon approval from their primary department, teach courses for the secondary departments.  In such instances, special arrangements must be made among the department heads and the dean.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>ix)	secondary appointments will have no effect on decisions regarding retrenchment.  An individual with a secondary appointment in another department will be regarded as a fully contributing member of his or her primary department and will retain full seniority in that department.  A decision to retrench all or part of the department in which the individual holds a secondary appointment will have no effect on this individual.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>x)	secondary appointments will normally be at the same rank as primary appointments.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>xi)	secondary appointments may cross school lines, i.e. an individual in one school may be given a secondary appointment in a department in another school.  In these cases, the individual may attend meetings of the faculty of their second school and serve on its committees, but may not normally have voting rights in full faculty meetings.

<DD>     <DD>     Students are given a set of objects which contain 25-30 unlabeled(both living and 
<DD>     <DD>     non-living) objects and are asked to create a classification system for them.  In 
<DD>     <DD>     a discussion the students and teacher develop several hierarchical classification 
<DD>     <DD>     schemes and examine the current system used for living organisms.  The students then use this knowledge to make a hierarchical scheme for the Oswegatchie River organisms they have found at the site.

<DD>     <DD>       One microscope will be set up at a station in the classroom.  Under the microscope is a specific organism, but there will be twenty five to thirty living and non-living objects/organisms the students will be required to observe.  The students go from one station to the next, studying and observing the physical properties of the organism/object located there.  When they have visited each station, and returned to their seat, they must organize and classify the organism in their own way (30 minutes).  A reason(s) must be given to support their choices.  There will be a class discussion relating to the type of classification used.  For example, the students may classify them shape, size, color, alive, or not alive, etc...  Following this, the students will create a concept map which shows their method of thinking, and how they got to the classification scheme.  As a group, the students must agree on which method used, was the most advantageous (15 minutes).

<DD>     <DD>       This days lesson serves as a continuation of the previous day.  The students are now using live specimens which they will collect / observe at the site.  The observed characteristics of the specimens will be recorded in their journals.  Type of specimens collected will include insects, fish, plants, small animals, and rocks.  The fish will be collected by using kick-nets provided by the Gouverneur school district.  All of the specimens will be kept alive and released after the information is obtained (30 minutes).  Upon completion, the students will discuss and give reasons describing specific characteristics of their organism.  A hypothesis pertaining to the correct classification of that organism must also be given by the student.  The five Kingdom approach will be touched on at the very end, and compared to the previously used approach (15 minutes).  They will all be handed a card with one organism on it, and they will be given a five Kingdom map.  As homework, they must classify that organism according to the five Kingdom classification system.  At some time on this day, the students will have to take a soil sample form this site for future experiments.

<DD>     <DD>      Journal Entry- Do you think the five Kingdoms approach is more accurate and reliable than the methods used by yourselves at first?  <BR>
<DD>     <DD>     On this day, students will go to the library and research the organisms found at the site.  This search will serve to provide them with the correct classifications for that organism (30 minutes).  When all the organisms have been designated a classification, the students will devise a flow chart which demonstrates the student's understanding of hierarchical classification (10-15 minutes).  The more branches there are is indicative of a greater understanding.

<dt><br>
	<dt>On proof of necessity of jury service or attending court  pursuant to a subpoena or other order of the court, an employee shall be granted leave with pay without charge to leave credits.  Leave with pay for jury service or pursuant to a subpoena shall mean leave at the rate of pay the employee would have received had the employee not been on such leave.

<dt><br>
	<dt>It is essential that an employee report any job-related accident immediately to his or her supervisor and to the Office of Public Safety.  Failure to do so could result in loss of benefits available to the employee for an absence due to an occupational injury.
<dt><br>
	<dt>Employees who incur an occupational injury or disease are eligible for benefits provided under the New York State Workers' Compensation Law and may be entitled to Workers' Compensation leave as provided in the State attendance and leave rules.  Under these rules, employees who are absent because of a job-related injury or disease may be granted up to 131 workdays of Workers' Compensation leave with pay without charge to leave credits, subject to a 15-day waiting period.  Subsequent absences may be charged to accumulated leave credits, sick leave, and leave without pay.  Leave beyond a cumulative total of one year is at the discretion of the College President.  A detailed explanation of the rights and responsibilities of employees wishing to avail themselves of these benefits is available from the Office of Human Resources.

	</dl>
 <dt>
<dt><BLOCKQUOTE>2.	<i><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="q2">ABSENCE:  EMERGENCY CLOSING OF STATE FACILITIES AND EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES</A></i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>State offices and other State facilities may be closed only by order of the Governor.  Local, government officials, police, radio and television stations do not have the authority to close State offices or facilities.  Presidents are authorized, however, to cancel classes and recommend that all but essential employees not report to work.
<dt><br>
		<dt>In the rare circumstance that the College is to be closed, the President will be so advised by System Administration through the Governor's Office of Employee Relations (GOER).  When the announcement is made that only essential service employees are expected to report to work, those people should make every effort to get to the College.  These would include physical plant, Public Safety, health service and other employees who are essential to maintaining the College's vital services.  Employees who work on these days will, of course, be marked present.  All others must charge the time to either personal leave, vacation or compensatory time.  Following certain snow emergencies the Department of Civil Service and the Governor's Office of Employee Relations may excuse the charge to leave credits.  This is usually granted only for severe multiple day closings, however, and is not automatic.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Notwithstanding the canceling of classes, no one who is able to get to work will be deprived of an opportunity to work.  Therefore, if  it is determined during the course of the day that the College cannot operate effectively, no employee will be required to leave at that moment.  The employee will however be permitted to leave then or any time thereafter.  Only the time that the employee is absent should be charged to leave credits.  An employee who does get to work may be advised that he/she cannot be guaranteed work at his/her normal work place.  It may be that the building in which the individual normally works is not open.  Provisions will be made for alternate campus work locations and alternate work for those who do get to the campus but who cannot go to their regular work places and cannot perform their regular work assignments.
<dt><br>
		<dt>However, an employee who has reported for work and, because of extraordinary circumstances beyond his/her control, for example extreme weather conditions or physical plant breakdown, is directed by the College President, or designee, to leave work, shall not be required to charge such directed absence during such day against leave accruals.  Any such release of employees shall not create any right to equivalent time off by employees who are not directed to leave work. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<dt>R.	<b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="r">LEAVE DONATION/EXCHANGE PROGRAM</A></b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>This is a pilot program providing for the donation of vacation leave credits to employees absent due to long-term personal illness.
<dt><br>
	<dt>The intent of this pilot program is to experiment with the concept of leave donation as a means of assisting employees, who because of long term illness, have exhausted all of their leave benefits as provided for in Sections 23.2 through 23.5 of the 1991-95 Agreement between the State and UUP, are subject to a severe loss of income during a continuing absence from work.  It is not the intent of this program to provide supplemental income which could result in compensation levels exceeding normal wages for employees, who have other means of substitute income, i.e., disability insurance program.
<dt><br>
	<dt>Donations may be made by UUP-represented employees to UUP-represented employees of the same campus who meet the following eligibility requirements:
<dt><br>
		<dt><BLOCKQUOTE>a)	are calendar year or college year employees eligible to accrue vacation leave credits pursuant to Section 23.2 of the 1991-95 Agreement between the State and UUP
<dt><br>
		<dt>b)	have completed at least one year of State service
<dt><br>
		<dt>c)	are absent due to a non-occupational, personal illness or disability for which they have submitted (and continue to submit as requested) medical documentation satisfactory to management
<dt><br>
		<dt>d)	have exhausted all leave benefits as provided in Sections 23.2 through 23.5 of the 1991-95 Agreement between the State and UUP
<dt><br>
		<dt>e)	are expected to be absent for at least two biweekly payroll periods following exhaustion of all leave benefits as provided in Sections 23.2 through 23.5 of the 1991-95 Agreement between the State and UUP
<dt><br>
		<dt>f)	must not have had any disciplinary actions, or unsatisfactory performance evaluations within their last three years of State employment</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dt>
	<dt>Donations can be used in full or half day units upon exhaustion of all leave benefits as provided in Sections 23.3 through 23.5 of the 1991-95 Agreement between the State and UUP and prior to attaining eligibility to receive disability benefits under the University's Group Disability Insurance Program as specified in Section 23.8 of the 1991-95 Agreement.  After attaining eligibility to receive disability benefits in accordance with Section 23.8 of the 1991-95 Agreement, but prior to receipt of such benefits, donated credits may be used in full day units only.  Once an eligible employee begins receiving disability benefits under the University's Disability Program, donated credits may no longer be used. 
<dt><br>
	<dt>Donations can be made from vacation leave only.
<dt><br>
	<dt>Donations must be made in full-day units.
<dt><br>
	<dt>Leave Donation Exchange
<dt><br>
	<dt>The following provisions allow for UUP-represented employees to participate in the voluntary donation or receipt of accrued vacation credit with other bargaining units or M/C employees:
<dt><br>
		<dd><BLOCKQUOTE>a)	Vacation credits may only be donated, received, or credited between employees of the same campus who are deemed eligible to participate in an authorized leave donation program, provided that there are simultaneously in effect a Leave Donation Exchange Memorandum of Agreement between the Governor's Office of Employee Relations and the employee organizations representing both the proposed recipient and the proposed donor, or applicable attendance rules for managerial or confidential employees.</BLOCKQUOTE>

S. <b><A NAME="s">VOLUNTARY REDUCTION IN WORK SCHEDULE PROGRAM (VRWS) - MANAGERIAL/CONFIDENTIAL EMPLOYEES (M/C)</A></b><BR>
<BR>
A Voluntary Reduction in Work Schedule (VRWS) program has been established for management/confidential employees (M/C).  In summary a full-time employee may reduce his or her work schedule by 30 percent or less and still be treated as full-time for attendance and leave purposes.<BR>
<BR>
The adjustment in salary must be made in minimum incriments of five percent, the smallest being one-half day's wages.  The corresponding adjustment in work schedule is accounted for by earning and charging a new category of accrued leave--Voluntary Reduction Credits (VR credits).  The participating employee and agency enter into a formal Voluntary Reduction in Work Schedule agreement, setting the terms and conditions of the program.  Guidelines and details are available in the Office of Human Resources.

		<dt>Guidelines for the administration of agency funds were
established on June 24, 1987 by the Chancellor of the State University Board of Trustees.  Agency funds are maintained by University-related organizations which have an established relationship with the State University of New York and/or its campus units.  These funds contain agency accounts.  Agency funds are resources held by a University-related organization in a custodial or fiscal agent capacity for the benefit of individual students, faculty or staff members, or appropriately recognized organizations and are not funds of the University-related
organization itself.

<dt><A NAME="12A5"><i>5</a>.	AIDS POLICY PROCEDURE</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is caused by Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus which may impair an individual's defense against infection thereby resulting in a complex of serious illnesses. AIDS virus is a fragile organism which will not easily survive outside a human host and is not easily spread from person to person except under very specific conditions relating to transfer of blood or semen.
<dt><br>
<dt>As an institution comprising over 4,000 individuals, Potsdam
College must be prepared to confront the possibility of this
disease on our campus.  The College policy on dealing with AIDS is written to conform to New York State and federal laws concerning confidentiality.
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>a)	SUNY Potsdam will follow the guidelines suggested by the American College Health Association.  Copies of these guidelines are on permanent file in the Crumb Library and Student Health Services.  They are available to all members of the college community.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
		<dt>b)	SUNY Potsdam's primary response to the threat of AIDS must be educational.  The College will conduct ongoing educational programs, designed to reach all members of the college community and to teach them about:
<dt><br>
<dd>1.	the nature of AIDS and means by which it is transmitted;
<dt><br>
<dd>2.	how to protect oneself and others against possible infection;
<dt><br>
			<dd>3.	how those infected with AIDS should prevent transmitting the disease;
<dt><br>
			<dd>4.	where individuals can receive testing and treatment for the disease;
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
		<dt>c)	Any college employee informed by another employee that he/she has AIDS must hold that information confidential.  The right of confidentiality is protected by law.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
		<dt>d)	Individuals who have AIDS may need special accommodations or restrictions.  Each case must be determined on an individual basis.  These determinations must be made according to the type and extent of the disease. Determinations will be made when permission is received from the individual with AIDS to release medical information.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
		<dt>e)	Those who wish AIDS testing will be referred for testing and counseling as provided by the State Health Department and AIDS Task Force.  The College Student Health Service will provide an information sheet regarding AIDS testing indicating the nature of the test.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
		<dt>f)	In the event of inquiries directed to the College by either the media or other members of the public concerning the incidence of AIDS on campus, the response will be that "We will neither confirm nor deny the incidence of AIDS on campus."

<dt><A NAME="12A6"><i>6</a>.	ALCOHOL POLICY</i>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A6a">a</a>)	Statement of Purpose
<dt><br>
			<dt>SUNY Potsdam recognizes that a responsible attitude towards the use of alcoholic beverages is a desirable goal and should be encouraged by College policy.  These regulations are to act as guidelines to provide members of the College community with an opportunity to develop a realistic and reasoned approach to alcohol use.  They presume adherence to New York State Law and respect for the rights of all others in the College community.  It is important to note that college policy does not recognize misuse of alcoholic beverages as an excuse for misconduct of any kind.
<dt><br>
<dt>The SUNY Potsdam Alcohol Regulations apply to all members of the College community and their guests.  They are in effect for all campus buildings and the College grounds.  They are meant to provide a framework through which responsible use of alcohol is a prime objective.  

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A6b">b</a>)	State and Local Alcohol Regulations

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A6bi">1</a>)	New York State Law
<dt><br>
				<dt>New York State has taken major steps to deal with alcohol abuse.  The penalties for "Driving While Ability Impaired" and "Driving While Intoxicated" have increased substantially (including fines, suspension or revocation of license, imprisonment.)  The best advice:  <B>if you drink, don't drive.</B>             
<dt><br>
				<dt>It is a crime in New York State to purchase alcoholic beverages for, or to give alcohol to, a person under 21 years of age.  The legislature has passed several bills to substantially increase penalties for these offenses. 
               <dt><br>
<dt>Effective December, 1985, the minimum legal age for purchase of alcoholic beverages became 21.  The College must comply with State law.
<dt><br>
<dt>Effective October, 1989, a person under the age of 21 who presents an altered New York State driver's license for the purpose of illegally purchasing an alcoholic beverage may be subject to a suspension of that driver's license for up to 90 days and may also be required to apply to the Department of Motor Vehicles for a restricted use driver's license following the suspension.
<dt><br>
<dt>Effective November, 1989, persons under the age of 21 who present falsified or fraudulently altered proofs of age for the purpose of purchasing or attempting to purchase alcoholic beverages are guilty of a violation.
<dt><br>
<dt>Effective January, 1990, persons under the age of 21 are prohibited from possessing any alcoholic beverage with intent to consume the beverage.  Alcoholic beverages involved in alleged violations of this law may be seized by authorized law enforcement officials, including campus public safety officers.                			
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A6bii">2</a>)	Civil Liability
<dt><br>
				<dt>General Obligations of New York State Section 11-100 provides for civil liability against any person knowingly causing intoxication of a person under 21 years of age by furnishing alcoholic beverages to that person or by aiding such a person in procuring alcoholic beverages.  Section 11-100 (Dram Act) provides for civil liability against any person selling or procuring alcoholic beverages for an intoxicated person regardless of age.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A6biii">3</a>)	Village of Potsdam
<dt><br>
				<dt>It is a violation in the Village of Potsdam to possess an open container that contains or has contained alcoholic beverages on a street, in a parking lot, on a highway, on a sidewalk, in other public places or in a motor vehicle.  This applies equally to the campus premises. 
</dl>
		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A6c">c</a>)	General Regulations
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	The College will not accept use of alcohol as an excuse for misconduct.
<dt><br>
			<dd>- 	The violation of New York State law and the ordinances of the Village of Potsdam regarding the use and possession of alcohol is a violation of SUNY Potsdam regulations.  New York State law regarding DWI and DWAI is applicable to all College property and the violation of same on College property constitutes a violation of these regulations.
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	Misconduct on College property resulting from the use of alcohol constitutes a violation of these regulations which may result in penalty as set forth in Article VI.
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	Possession of any alcoholic beverage by a person under the age of twenty-one (21) is expressly forbidden.
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	Referrals of alcohol abusers to an appropriate campus program or to the St. Lawrence County Alcohol Referral Service may be a provision of any penalty or sanction for violation of these regulations.  
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	Use of alcoholic beverages at the Star Lake Campus is authorized by and is subject to the approval of the Campus Director.  The SUNY Potsdam regulations apply to the Star Lake Campus.
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	No vendor shall deliver, or cause to have delivered, alcoholic beverages to the campus except where such delivery is made to a College authorized representative or agent of a licensed vendor (i.e. PACES).
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	"Possession" shall not include possessing alcoholic beverages pursuant to a person's employment responsibilities.
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	Any violation(s) of these regulations shall be dealt with in accordance with Article VI.
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	Alcoholic beverage restrictions are determined by the policy governing the type of area in which alcohol is to be involved (i.e. Thatcher Hall, residence hall room) rather than the type of event (i.e. party, function).

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A6ei">1</a>)	Individual:
<dt><br>
	<dd>(a)	Possession and use of alcoholic beverages in residence halls is governed by New York State law and College policies.  Possession of any alcoholic beverage by a person under the age of twenty-one (21) is expressly against this policy.  Alcohol is not allowed in public areas such as hallways, floor lounges or kitchens unless the area has been approved by Residence Life, Public Safety and the Board of Alcohol Review for a specific event.
<dt><br>
				<dd>(b)	No multiple quart/liter containers of alcoholic beverages nor any containers of alcoholic beverages with/or requiring taps are allowed in student rooms at any time.  Amounts of alcoholic beverages available in student rooms need to be reasonable and prudent from the perspective that this policy tries to promote responsibility if there is consumption of alcoholic beverages and which recognizes the rights of roommates and other residents of the residence hall.  The time to ascertain what is a reasonable and prudent amount of alcoholic beverages for a gathering is before that gathering.  This can only be done through discussions with professional Residence Life staff.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A6eii">2</a>)	Residence Hall Party Regulations:
<dt><br>
				<dd>(a)	Parties involving alcohol in designated areas of   the residence halls must be registered in advance at the quad office using the registration authorization form.
<dt><br>
				<dd>(b)	Parties planned and/or sponsored by individuals, non-official organizations or official organizations must petition the Residence Hall Director for permission to use residence hall facilities.  Problems with organizations may be referred for administrative action.
<dt><br>
				<dd>(c)	The Residence Hall Director may, in consultation with hall government and the Student Life Coordinator, refuse permission if in his/her judgment the rights of residents will be abridged by the granting of permission.  The details of refusal must be forwarded to the Director of Residence Life.
<dt><br>
				<dd>(d)	Cost of repairs for any damage resulting from the use of alcoholic beverages will be assessed against the party sponsor(s) according to the provisions of the residence hall license.
<dt><br>
				<dd>(e)	No multiple quart/liter containers of alcoholic beverages nor any containers of alcoholic beverages with/or requiring taps are allowed at residence hall parties from midnight Sunday through 5:00 pm Friday.
<dt><br>
				<dd>(f)	All parties are to be supervised by a member of the professional staff, an R.A., or by members of the hall government.  The number of Control Agents required shall be determined by the appropriate Director(s) according to the size of the party.  Control Agents and designated supervisors shall not consume alcohol at the party.
<dt><br>
				<dd>(g)	Any registered party may be held only in designated areas jointly proposed by Residence Life, Public Safety and the Board of Alcohol Review.
<dt><br>
				<dd>(h)	Residence Life staff has the right to regulate the number of functions on any given night in each residence hall.  No scheduled functions are permitted after 1:00 am.  All requests must be registered and approved in advance with the hall government and the Residence Hall Director.
<dt><br>
				<dd>(i)	A gathering is considered to be a small, informal group of individuals and requires no prior approval.  When a gathering has the potential for exceeding the capacity of the room or suite by  numbers of people or noise, it is considered to be a party and requires prior approval.  For guidelines related to capacity of an area, contact a Residence Life professional.

All other areas require that PACES purchase a one day caterer's permit from the New York State Liquor Authority (through the St. Lawrence County Alcoholic Beverage Control Board).  This requires 2-3 weeks; the cost of this permit will be passed on to the sponsoring group.  NOTE:  Alcohol to be consumed on the first floor of the Student Union patio and Thatcher Hall must be provided, sold and controlled by PACES.  Requests for use of alcohol on the 2nd floor of the Student Union are subject to approval and controls established by the Director of the Student Union & Activities.  It is a violation of the New York State liquor law to bring alcoholic beverages into a licensed facility.

<A NAME="12A"><b>A</a>.	CAMPUS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</b>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<A NAME="12A10"><i>10</a>.	BOMB THREAT</i>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>THE MOST important concern in any threat to campus property or people is to provide quick and orderly safety to all concerned.  Secondary but also important is the clarity with which campus functions will proceed while under the emergency procedures.  Guidelines for bomb threats are as follows.
<dt><br>
<dt>1.	The Director of Public Safety will determine the need for closing one or more buildings or events.
<dt><br>
		<dt>2.	At the point a building is closed or event is terminated an attempt will be made to suggest the duration, i.e. "closed for the day," or "postponed until ________."
<dt><br>
		<dt>3.	The Director of Public Safety will, in conjunction with the Assistant Vice President for Facilities, post notices on the building and, if appropriate, identify where continued information and services can be forwarded. "Class information will be available in the Barrington Union" or "____________ services will be provided in _________________ ."
<dt><br>
		<dt>4.	The Director of Public Safety will notify the Provost, Vice President for Student Life, the Office of Human Resources, and the Director of College Relations who will in turn notify appropriate services and teaching units.		
<dt><br>
	<dt>5.	All personnel not instructed by the above will report to the Office of Human Resources.
<dt><br>
		<dt>6.	In the event Dunn Hall and main switchboard cannot be the communication center, emergency phones will be established in Barrington Student Union.
<dt><br>
		<dt>7.	Director of College relations will serve as primary media contact. 
<dt><br>
		<dt>*** Any employee receiving a threatening call should immediately call Public Safety at *2222..  Special attention to such as the following are crucial:  Sex of caller, background noise, type of "bomb" and any location specifics.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<dt><A NAME="12A11"><i><BLOCKQUOTE>11</a>.	BUILDING ADMINISTRATOR:  POLICIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</i>
 <dt><br>
		<dt>Each academic building on the SUNY Potsdam campus shall have a building administrator, preferably a person already residing in that building.  The building administrator shall be appointed by the President of the College after appropriate consultation.  He/she shall be willing and able to assume the position and all associated responsibilities.  The appointee shall be a full-time member of the faculty, professional or administrative staff of the College.  He/she shall serve for a period of one year, the appointment to be made at the beginning of the Fall semester and be renewable each year thereafter.  The building administrator is the chief administrator in charge of his/her building at the direction of the President of the College and is ultimately responsible for the well-being of the facility.  The building administrator will have the authority to make decisions and carry out those duties which affect comfort, convenience, safety and energy conservation.  In this regard, the building administrator will work closely with the Offices of Physical Plant, Public Safety and his/her building custodians.  The building administrator's name, office and telephone numbers and official building hours shall be prominently posted in the main lobby of his/her building.
<dt><br>
<dt>Specifically, the building administrator shall:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
<dt>a)	Perform his/her responsibilities in a competent, positive and timely fashion.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>b)	Be authorized to delegate selected responsibilities associated with the position to one or more individuals in that building with the understanding that the building administrator is ultimately responsible for decisions or policies made regarding use of the facility.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>c)	Make regular tours of his/her building making sure that all equipment and facilities essential to good work/study practices are in proper working order.  All irregularities that cannot be taken care of by the regular building custodians shall be referred to the  building administrator.  He/she shall then prepare a work order and send it to the Office of Physical Plant for action.  (A written record of such findings will be kept by the building administrator.)

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>d)	Shall be notified of and act on all requests to use facilities after normal working hours or on weekends making sure that such utilization does not violate College policies.  All approved requests must have written authorization from the building administrator. All requests for keys must also have his/her written authorization.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>e)	Accompany Public Safety, Physical Plant representatives and state inspectors on all scheduled safety and fire prevention tours.  The building administrator shall make certain that all potentially dangerous situations and particularly those conditions that affect the handicapped are immediately referred to the appropriate administrative office.  He/she shall also make certain that necessary information recorded during fire drills is submitted to the Office of Public Safety.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>f)	Be notified of all accidental occurrences in his/her building and keep a record of such.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>g)	Be apprised in advance of all activities regarding structural modification, scheduling pesticide spraying or changes in College policies which might affect building usage.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>h)	Act on requests to use audio-visual hardware and other equipment already under the supervision of the building administrator.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>i)	When requested, meet with the Environment Advisory Committee for the purpose of providing input on matters of safety, comfort and energy conservation.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>j)	Serve as a member of a group of all building administrators, this group to constitute the Council of Building Administrators to be convened by the President of the College or designee at the beginning of the Fall semester.  At this time, the President will officially appoint building administrators and discuss responsibilities and policies.
          <dt><br>

	<dt><A NAME="12A12"><i><BLOCKQUOTE>12</a>.	BUILDING USE</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Building use by any individual or organization must be recognized by the campus as educationally oriented and non profit in nature.  Student organizations must be recognized by the Student Government Association; Faculty and Staff organizations recognized by the College administration, and non-College affiliated users approved by the President or his/her designee.  (Director of Continuing Education.)

<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt><A NAME="12A12a">a</A>)	Use by College Affiliated Group - Building use by any College affiliated group or individual is approved by the individual building administrator and related directly to the scheduling of the spaces within the facility involved.  General instructional space on campus such as classrooms, lecture halls, etc. are scheduled by the Office of the College Registrar.  Specific dedicated instructional spaces are normally scheduled either by the academic unit involved and/or the building administrator.  In each case, the building administrator is aware of the scheduled use of all such direct instructional spaces within the building over which he/she has jurisdiction.  Therefore, the single contact with the building administrator provides the necessary input as to the availability of the space for which the use is requested.  It is the building administrator's responsibility to check with any academic unit to ascertain whether they have scheduled prior use of any such space, in addition to that shown on the class schedule.  Forms for building use are sent to building administrators

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt><A NAME="12A12b">b)	Use By Non-College Affiliated Groups -  All use of facilities by any non-College affiliated group or individual is channeled through the President's designee, Director of Continuing Education. That person bears the responsibility to insure that the requested use meets the required criteria, then contacts the building administrator involved to ascertain whether the space is available for the intended purpose.  A standard form exists for all such requests for use of space by non-College affiliated groups or individuals.  Any prolonged use in excess of thirty days requires prior approval of the Central Office of the State University and State Comptrollers Office.  Use of space for less than 30 days requires approval of the President of the College or his/her designee.  Long term use requires the completion of a revocable permit.  The short term use is handled locally and approved by the President, while the long term use requires formal presentation through Central Administration of State University and the Comptrollers Office and becomes a comprehensive and complex document. Use of all space on campus is based on a priority system.  
<dt><br>
			<dt>The direct needs of the academic program take the highest priority followed closely by student and staff activities.  Other scheduled activities that relate to the total College program receive the next priority.  Other requested uses by College or non-College affiliated individuals or organizations are then considered.</BLOCKQUOTE>

		<dt>The College President, Executive Director of the  Potsdam College Foundation, nominator and/or donor will initiate the confidential process of naming.  The President may inform and involve the Executive Staff and other college administration as appropriate.  The College President will appoint a screening committee as needed to review any naming requests.
<dt><br>
<dt>The screening committee will review the nominee's contributions and qualifications relative to the mission and spirit of the college and the SUNY guidelines.  The committee is authorized to consult with appropriate campus offices and constituencies in this process.  Upon completion of the review, the committee will make a recommendation to the President.
<dt><br>
<dt>The President, after review and consideration, may forward the recommendation to the College Council or may terminate the recommendation.
<dt><br>
<dt>The College Council will forward its recommendation to the Chancellor for the SUNY Trustees, or may terminate the recommendation.

		<dt>GENERAL UNDERSTANDINGS
<dt><br>
			<dt>Buildings or grounds may be named for individuals (living or deceased) and/or organizations, with the primary criteria of dedicated support of and commitment to the enhancement of SUNY Potsdam, its mission and its efforts.  Each situation is judged on its own merit, taking into account significant contributions of personal service as well as monetary or in-kind gifts.
<dt><br>
<dt>Naming for gifts (cash or in-kind): consideration should be given to previous contributions, the purpose of the gift and the proportional relationship of the gift to the project for which it is intended.
<dt><br>
<dt>Naming an existing building:  this implies a significant contribution of the donor both in terms of size and relationship to the original or renovated cost and purpose of the building or facility as well as significance for the future.
<dt><br>
	<dt>DEFINITION OF TERMS
<dt><br>
			<dt>Outstanding service (above and beyond the call of duty) to the college includes excellence as an employee or an individual serving in a voluntary capacity; scholarly contributions; college service.
<dt><br>
<dt>Prominence refers to the overall reputation in the local area or elsewhere with a record of substantial contributions to society - for example, in education, environment, public service.
<dt><br>
<dt>Substantial gift includes the nominee's ongoing affiliation with and financial support for the college combined with a reputation for quality and caring on campus and in the community.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<dt><A NAME="12A15"><i><BLOCKQUOTE>15</a>.	COMPUTING CODE OF ETHICS</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Every user of SUNY Potsdam's computing facility has the fundamental right to privacy and is entitled to a fair share of resources.  It is unethical for any user to violate these principles
<dt><br>
<dt>Each usercode and associated password belong to an individual.  All use should be in accordance with SUNY Potsdam policy on computer use set forth in this document.  Owners accept the burden for the responsible use of their usercode.
<dt><br>
<dt>Electronically-stored files are presumed to be private and confidential unless the owner has explicitly made them available to the public.
<dt><br>
<dt>Use of the network or electronic mail facilities for transmitting anonymous, rude, abusive, harassing or malicious messages is unethical.
<dt><br>
<dt>The unauthorized copying of any software that is licensed or protected by copyright is theft and thus unethical.
<dt><br>
<dt>Although SUNY Potsdam's computing systems and network are not invulnerable to deliberate abuse, knowledge of a special password or any weaknesses in the established security systems should not be used to deliberately degrade SUNY Potsdam's computing systems, its network, personal computers, nor deprive other users of the resources of any SUNY Potsdam or individually-owned computer.
<dt><br>
<dt>When necessary for the maintenance of a system network, SUNY Potsdam Information Services Personnel may restrict availability of shared resources.  It may also be necessary to look at a user's file to follow up on reported problems.
<dt><br>
<dt>Use of computer resources is a privilege, not a right, and is granted with restrictions and responsibilities for their use.  Misuse of College computer resources can result in their revocation.      
<dt><br>
<dt>Use of resources associated with college computer accounts for direct financial gain (e.g., commercial consulting) is unethical.    
<dt><br>
<dt>Violation of the Computing Code of Ethics may subject a user to disciplinary action.

<dt><br>
<dt>Obtaining an Email Account (usercode)
<dt><br>
			<dt>In order to use electronic mail at SUNY Potsdam it is necessary to have an email "account" or usercode for each user.  This prevents anonymous mail and establishes the electronic address for each email user to which electronic mail can be received from other email users on or off campus.  Each email account is protected, in part, from unauthorized access by requiring the use of a unique password to identify the legitimate user.
          <dt><br>
<dt>Any student, faculty or staff member of SUNY Potsdam identification may request an email account.  While SUNY Potsdam does not prohibit the use of email for personal           reasons, users should be informed that the primary intention
of providing email service is to support the educational mission of the college and the conduct of its daily business.

		<dt>Postmaster Responsibilities for Email
<dt><br>
		<dt>It may be necessary at times for the local SUNY Potsdam email postmaster to read an electronic mail message which has failed to reach its destination in order to determine, if possible, the intended addressee and redirect the message to the correct address.  However, it is otherwise not the practice of the postmaster to read or to discuss the content of any message.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>Privacy of Email
<dt><br>
		<dt>It is impossible to ensure the confidentiality of any electronic messages stored or communicated through our computing facilities.  As pointed out by other universities, "The privacy of electronic mail is somewhere between that of a letter and a postcard."  While confidentiality cannot be ensured, all email is considered private and confidential. Except as noted under Postmaster Responsibilities for Email above, email is not to be read by computing center staff or any others with sufficient computer system privileges to do so.
         </dl>

<dt>Hierarchy of Communication with Email
<dt><br>
		<dt>Email is a person-to-person form of electronic communication, addressed to a specific individual and does not adhere to any chain of command in its delivery.  Anyone may write to anyone.

<dt>Ethics of Email

<strong>XIII.  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</strong></center>
<dt><br><BR>

<dd><dl>
<A NAME="13A">A</A>.	<b>EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICY OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK (SUNY)</b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>The State University of New York Board of Trustees adopted an Equal Opportunity policy in 1971 calling for the development of a University-wide Affirmative Action Program to "detail actions designed to realize our University's commitment to equal employment; analyze employment patterns within the University; set forth plans to rectify any deficiencies; identify and remove impediments to equal opportunity;...provide for internal and external dissemination of University policy; pursue the commitment to equal opportunity throughout the institution; and provide for the review, assessment, evaluation, and improvement of University action in carrying out...Affirmative Action Programs.  The SUNY Office for Affirmative Action, a part of the Chancellor's Office has responsibility for implementation of this policy.  In addition to the matters listed above, the Office also has responsibility for administering the SUNY Discrimination Grievance Procedure, programs for the handicapped, and programs to encourage minority business development.
    <dt><br> 
	<dt>Today, every SUNY campus has a designated Affirmative Action Officer, and Affirmative Action Committee, which is advisory to the campus President, and a written Affirmative Action Plan and Program.  There is also a system-wide SUNY Task Force on Affirmative Action, which is advisory to the Chancellor.
<dt><br>
	<dt>Employees of the State University of New York are assured equal opportunity without regard to race, sex, age, national origin, religion, marital status, pregnancy, disability, ex-offender status, or sexual orientation.  In addition Vietnam Era Veterans and disabled veterans are ensured equal opportunity under the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Act of 1974.
<dt><br>
	<dt>Any employee of the State University of New York who believes that he or she has been discriminated against in any personnel decision or condition of employment may file a complaint with his or her campus Affirmative Action Officer using the University's Internal Discrimination Grievance Procedures.  A copy of the procedures is available from the campus Office for Affirmative Action.  Externally, complaints may be filed with the local office of the Equal Employment for Human Rights.  Complaints of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation may be filed with the Governor's Office for Employee Relations in Albany.  The campus Affirmative Action Officer will provide addresses, phone numbers, and filing procedures to any employee requesting such information.

<dt><br>
<A NAME="13B">B</A>.	<b>EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICY OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK, AT POTSDAM</b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>SUNY POTSDAM is committed to the principles of non- discrimination and equality of opportunity in all of its personnel procedures and practices.  The College recruits, selects, hires,  trains and promotes staff and provides benefits without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age or handicap except where sex, age or handicap are bona fide occupational qualifications.
<dt><br>
	<dt>It is the policy of the SUNY Potsdam to provide equal opportunity in employment and upward mobility for all qualified persons, to prohibit discrimination in employment because of age, color, handicap, marital status, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual preference, and Vietnam Era Veteran status.
<dt><br>
	<dt>This policy of equal employment opportunity:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
	<dt>1.	Applies to all persons without regard to race, creed, color, national origin, age or sex, except where sex is a bona fide occupational qualification.
<dt><br>
	<dt>2.	Applies equally to all job classifications and titles at SUNY Potsdam and to all types of appointment, whether full-time or part-time.
<dt><br>
	<dt>3.	Governs all college employment policies, practices and actions including but not necessarily limited to recruitment, employment, rate of pay or other compensation, advancement, upgrading, promotion, demotion, renewal, non-renewal, termination, transfer, layoff, leave, training and employee benefits of whatever nature.
<dt><br>
	<dt>4.	Applies to all college employees wherever physically located.
<dt><br>
	<dt>5.	Expects each contractor, supplier, union, public agency or other cooperative agent to support this policy by complying with all applicable State and Federal equal employment opportunity laws and regulations.
<dt><br>
	<dt>In addition to providing equal employment opportunities for all qualified persons, the College has a special commitment to the principle of Affirmative Action, which entails a positive, ongoing effort to seek qualified members of two under-represented groups:  women and minorities.  It is the goal of this College to achieve equitable representation of women and minorities in all academic, administrative, and service units of the College.
</dl><!-- 1 -->
<dt><br>
<A NAME="13C">C</A>.	<b>COMMITMENT TO QUALITY</b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>The standing of SUNY Potsdam as a leading liberal arts college in the State of New York and in the nation requires that it recruit staff of the highest possible caliber.  Its faculty and staff should be highly qualified for their positions and they should show promise of achievement in the future.  They should exhibit breadth as well as depth of talent and they should be drawn from a diversity of backgrounds.
<dt><br>
	<dt>The search for new talent should, under normal circumstances, be national in scope.  It should include advertising in leading professional journals, contact with major centers of excellence and a systematic attempt to bring to the campus the most talented and promising candidates.  The College should avoid settling for less than the best.

<dt><br>
<A NAME="13D">D</A>.	<b>RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES</b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>From the Office of the President of the College:
<dt><br>
	<dt>"The search for candidates to fill faculty and staff positions is perhaps the most important activity in which we as a College engage.  Through such searches, we announce not only our philosophy of hiring but also, in effect, the quality and nature of our institution.  On a more subtle level, we also signal the kind of curricula we offer - and whether or not we are current in this area.  Most importantly, searches constitute the principal means for creating the SUNY Potsdam of tomorrow, since the faculty and staff members hired as a result of the search process today will be the core of the institution in years to come.  We must settle for nothing less than the very best in candidates and must act assertively to locate and attract them to our campus, even if doing so requires more than traditional methods of advertising positions and examining applications.
<dt><br>
	<dt>The search process, while primarily the means for acquiring new and needed colleagues, also comes to represent the College in the forum of public and social concern.  For this reason, the search procedure carries with it great social responsibility.  Over the past several decades, we as a people have recognized the need to represent more accurately in the workplace the diversity of cultures and the differences based on gender that are expressed in our society at large.  In response to this imperative, policies have evolved to rectify the imbalances that resulted, seemingly automatically though often perhaps unconsciously, in previous hiring practices in all sectors.  As a public institution, we particularly embrace these policies as our own.
<dt><br>
	<dt>In so doing, we subscribe to the egalitarian principles that lie at the heart of our society.  We must guarantee to all members of society equal access to real opportunities for development and growth.  But our dedication to such a philosophy benefits those of us who offer such opportunities, as well as those to whom they are offered.  It is by now a truism that faculty members who are women or members of minorities provide role models to those of our students who share either their gender or their ethnic origins.  Less acknowledged but equally important is the kind of model these members represent to traditional, non-minority students as well, who can learn new and different approaches to academic subjects than those traditional faculty members might be able to offer.  The presence of women and minority faculty members also provides all of our students with a real sense of the multicultural society they are about to enter as adults, and the options in thought and manner that a pluralistic society encourages, and on which it depends.
<dt><br>
	<dt>Likewise, the entire faculty gains from the variety in perspective and opinion that often follows from differences in gender, race, or ethnicity among its members.  The scholarly activity stimulated by these differences also fosters growth in the general body of academic knowledge, often charting new areas of scholarship and research, and teaching us new ways to know.  Thus the pursuit of affirmative action  policies benefits us all." 
<dt><br>
	<dt>A summary of the College's recruitment procedures follows.  Complete details are found in the manual - SEARCH COMMITTEE PROCEDURES available from the Offices of Human Resources or Affirmative Action.

	<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
<dt><A NAME="13D1">1.</A>	<i>INITIATING THE SEARCH</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>In identifying vacant positions that will be advertised as tenure-track, the dean/director will meet with department chairs to prioritize and define the proposed positions.  Positions that have been filled after having been advertised as temporary must be readvertised if the positions are converted to permanent or tenure-track.  It should not be assumed that all vacancies from retirements, resignations, terminations will be filled and that positions that have previously been "temporary" will be converted to tenure-track.

		<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
<dt><A NAME="13D1a">a</A>)	Recruitment Request
<dt><br>
			<dt>To formally initiate the search, approval must be obtained by securing the signature and approval of the Dean and others indicated on the recruitment request form.  All Recruitment Requests will be reviewed by Priorities Council to determine whether the search can go forward.  Upon receipt of the signed form, Human Resources is authorized to begin the search.

		<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13D1b">b</A>)	Advertising
<dt><br>
			<dt>Departments will prepare the ad as they recommend it be sent.  Rank, title, salary range, job description and application procedures will be determined by the Provost.  This information is to be forwarded to Human Resources via e-mail with a hard copy of the ad or placed in a shared folder/drop box.  General information pertaining to SUNY Potsdam will be prepared by Human Resources.  Advertising should be broad and open to attract the largest number of applicants.  The position describes the essential qualifications and duties.  The final ad copy will be prepared as a result of consultation with the department, Dean, Provost, and Vice President.  Before going to print, each advertisement must be reviewed and approved by the department chair (or dean after conversation with the department chair).

			<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
<dt><A NAME="13D1bi">i</A>)	Faculty Searches
<dt><br>
				<dt>In order to advertise a position as tenure-track, the ad must normally be placed by November 1.  Human Resources will place one master ad in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Black Issues in Higher Education, and the Hispanic Outlook early in the fall semester after consultation and approval by the Provost.  To the extent possible, all anticipated openings should be listed in this combined job announcement.

			<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13D1bii">ii</A>)	Professional and Management Searches
<dt><br>
				<dt>The campus has established a policy in which these positions are advertised either internally first or simultaneously internally/externally.  This process will allow internal candidates to be considered prior to extending the position to external candidates.  
<dt><br>
			<dt>In addition, departments should for all positions:<br>
			<dt>--	identify and provide the advertising copy for other publications, such as disciplinary publications, specialized journals, publications geared to women or minorities, etc.  As with the Chronicle ad, these ads must also be reviewed, and approved by the Deans.<br>
			<dt>--	Contact historically black institutions and ask for recommendations<br>
			<dt>--	Contact professional organizations to determine if there are minority or women's caucuses, committees, or employment registers<br>
			<dt>--	Make personal contacts with colleagues who might be interested in a move or might nominate others<br>
			<dt>--	Make telephone calls to colleagues and schools to seek out underrepresented applicants<br>
			<dt>--	Use source lists of minority candidates available through the dean's offices<br>
			<Dt>--	Utilize employment services at conventions
</dl><!-- 3 -->
		<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13D1c">c</A>)	Composition of the Search Committee
<dt><br>
			<dt>The chair of the search committee may or may not be the department chair or director.  In the case of a search for a department chair, at least one member of the search committee shall come from outside the affected department.  The committee should have a minimum of three members, and may be as large as deemed appropriate.  In the spirit of a student-centered campus, serious consideration should be given to having one or more students serve as committee members.  Even if students do not serve on the search committee, student involvement should be sought in the search process.
<dt><br>
			<dt>The search committee should reflect the interests and characteristics of various constituencies, taking into consideration ethnicity, gender, age, different areas of specialization within the department.  Search committees should be balanced.  If there is not sufficient diversity within a hiring department, serious consideration should be given to including a member from outside the department.  In general, if search committees themselves are diverse, we may be more successful in attracting multicultural candidates.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Other considerations:<br>
			<dt>--	Are the interests of non-tenured faculty and staff included?<br>
			<dt>--	Is someone with prior search committee experience on the committee?<br>
			<dt>--	Are the search committee nominees aware of the time commitment their participation will involve?<br>
			<dt>--	Should any members from outside the department be involved in the search?  (This may be appropriate in the absence of women and/or minorities in the department).<br>
			<dt>--	Is there anyone with access to special networks of talent that the search committee might tap for nominees?<br>
<dt><br>
			<dt>The final composition of a faculty search committee and selection of the chair will be determined in consultation with the appropriate dean/director who may add committee members from outside the hiring department.
<dt><br>
			<dt>If the position to be searched for is Vice President or President, the Faculty Assembly By-Laws require a process different from the one identified above.

		<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13D1d">d</A>)	Search Committee Charge
<dt><br>
			<dt>The dean/director/provost/vice president/president should specify the role of the committee.  It may be to identify and recommend for appointment qualified applicants not to make job offers or engage in discussions with candidates on term and conditions of employment.
</dl><!-- 2 -->
	<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13D2">2</A>.	<i>FOLLOW-UP ON APPLICATIONS</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>A letter of acknowledgement and affirmative action card should be sent immediately upon receipt of an application.  Applicants should be informed as to the timetable of decision-making.  As vitae are received, they are to be available for review by the dean/director and appropriate vice president/provost.  Vitae of women and applicants from protected classes may be requested for special review.
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt>a)	Develop Written Criteria for Screening
<dt><br>
			<dt>Prior to the receipt of applications, the committee should decide upon the criteria to be used for preliminary and final screening stages.  The preliminary screening should be limited to information contained in the advertisement.  For example, if the ad specified a Ph.D., all applicants without a doctorate should be rejected.  If no minimum amount of experience was stated in the ad, candidates should not be eliminated on the basis of a lack of experience at this early stage.
<dt><br>
			<dt>The search committee identifies those applicants who do not meet the qualifications for the position and so informs them.  Remaining applicants may be asked to send additional material by a specific date.
<dt><br>
		<dt>b)	The following MUST take place PRIOR to inviting candidates to campus:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	It is a good idea to send candidates information about SUNY Potsdam.  This could include the catalog, recent class schedule, the brochure SUNY Potsdam: A Profile, and any departmental documents that would help the candidate understand the nature of the vacant position and the college.  Information on the town of Potsdam may also be sent to the candidate and is available in Human Resources.
<dt><br>
			<dt>ii)	Telephone referencing:  The search committee should discuss in advance the questions to be asked.  These questions should be in writing to ensure that consistent questions are asked about each candidate.  Contact only persons who have been listed as references by the candidate.  With the candidate's permission you can contact references other than those listed by the candidate.  Arrangements may be made for a conference call through the Office of Human Resources.  Conference calls also can be set up via tele-media box.  Long-distance calls will be charged to the Office of Human Resources.
<dt><br>
			<dt>iii)	Telephone interview of finalists:  Before a campus interview is scheduled, a telephone interview of finalists may be conducted.  A written interview protocol should be prepared by the committee for use during the interviews and retained in the committee's files as part of the search record.  Each candidate should be asked the same questions for purposes of comparison and fairness.  Information is also provided  on resources available in Human Resources to improve the interviewing skills of committee members.
<dt><br>
			<dt>iv)	Consultation with the Dean/Director:  The Dean/Director should be informed as to the characteristics of the applicant pool and of the qualifications of the finalists who may be invited to campus.  The Dean/Director/Vice President/Provost/President may choose to examine the pool of candidates.  The number of candidates to invite for campus interviews will be decided in consultation with the Dean/Director (but normally will be limited to two).  The Dean/Director will consult with the appropriate Provost/ Vice President before giving verbal approval to invite candidates to campus.
<dt><br>
			<dt>v)	Filing of the "Request to Invite Candidate to Campus" Form (one for each candidate who will be invited to visit the campus).  Candidates may not be invited until the request has been approved by the Dean/Director and Provost/Vice President (or designee).  Travel arrangements will be made by a local travel agent in consultation with the candidate and the department chair.  IMPORTANT:  This form must be filed BEFORE a candidate can be brought to campus!
</dl><!-- 3 -->
</dl><!-- 2 -->
	<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13D3">3</A>.	<i>THE ON-CAMPUS INTERVIEW</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>In order to hire from the strongest possible pool, it is important to invite candidates to campus as soon as possible.  For faculty searches, this may mean that candidates can be brought to campus during the first semester.
<dt><br>
		<dt>The Office of Human Resources' memorandum on "Recruitment Guidelines," deals with how to finance a search, what expenses can be paid, etc.  Recruitment costs have risen significantly in recent years and departments are expected to follow guidelines to help reduce recruitment-related expenses.
<dt><br>
		<dt>In addition to appropriate department personnel and committees, all candidates invited to campus must be scheduled to meet with:<br>
		<dt>a.	the appropriate dean/director<br>
		<dt>b.	a member of the Office of Human Resources<br>
		<dt>c.	students and others as determined by the department responsible for the position recruitment
<dt><br>
		<dt>If the candidate is a person of color, search chairs should contact the Assistant Vice President for Multicultural Affairs, who is eager to assist in the hiring process.  Her involvement can make candidates more aware of the support groups, services, and opportunities available, and improve the College's chances of hiring these candidates.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Please check with the Dean/Director's offices before inviting a candidate for specific days.  A copy of the candidate's vita and interview schedule must be made available to each interviewer prior to the interview.  Those persons conducting interviews should also be given an evaluation form.
<dt><br>
		<dt>An interview schedule should also be given to the candidate in advance of that person's arrival on campus.  The schedule often makes a lasting impression on the candidate.  Some suggested guidelines (which may appear all-too-obvious to most search committee chairs): schedules should be typed; schedules should be checked for accuracy in spelling, individuals' titles, etc.; proof schedules with an eye to how an outsider will view the professionalism of the hiring department (e.g. do not say "lunch with whoever (sic) in the Gallery"), allow time for a break during the interview.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Be sure to have written questions prepared ahead of time.  The department should have prepared a core set of questions to be asked of all candidates.  Care should be taken to avoid asking inappropriate questions.
<dt><br>
		<dt>As part of the interview process, all candidates interviewed for faculty positions on campus are expected to be placed in a 'teaching situation' involving faculty and students and appropriate to the discipline.  Generally, candidates should teach a scheduled class (except where not appropriate for some library positions).  This includes internal candidates, who should be asked to teach a class not in a course they are currently teaching.  If this is not possible, consider scheduling a "teaching simulation".  You can create a "class" of faculty and staff.  Search committee and faculty members should attend, their schedules permitting.  Interviews may give few clues as to teaching effectiveness, but a good (or bad!) teacher frequently can be identified in a teaching simulation.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Keep records as your search proceeds.  It is a good idea to keep minutes of search committee meetings.  Above all, retain candidate evaluation forms and all written comments.  This is particularly important when an internal candidate is a finalist for a tenure-track position.  All candidates must be afforded as equal as possible interview opportunities.

	<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13D4">4</A>.	<I>CONCLUDING THE SEARCH</I>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt>a)	Request to Hire Form:  Once the decision has been made as to whom to hire, a Request to Hire form must be completed including the information regarding the gender/racial/protected class composition of the applicant pool.  In some cases, the President or designee may request further information about the search process from the search committee before approving this form.  All the appropriate signatures must appear before the President or designee approves the final hiring.
 <dt><br>
		<dt>b)	Affirmative Action Cards:  The affirmative action cards are used to gather data for use in preparing the College's affirmative action plan.  To identify more clearly which affirmative action card goes with what vacancy, labels identifying the search will be prepared by Human Resources affixed to the affirmative action cards prior to their mailing to the search committee chair.  The cards will be mailed from the candidates directly to Human Resources.  Human Resources will forward the cards to the search committee chair upon receipt of the Request to Invite Candidates to Campus form.  The search committee chair will complete the affirmative action reporting on the back of the Request to Hire form.
<dt><br>
		<dt>c)	Search Records:  Each search committee chair should keep records and notes of evaluations of each candidate's credentials, reference checks, rating forms and interview results.  Upon the culmination of the search, all records and files should be completed and maintained for three years after the completion of the fiscal year in which the search was conducted.  These records will be used by the College in the event of a review by an outside agency (affirmative action, Department of Labor, etc.).  Such records must be retained in either the department office or returned to Human Resources.
<dt><br>

A.	<strong><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="A">CODE OF ETHICS</A></strong>	
<dt><br>
	<dt>All New York State employees are bound by a Code of Ethics designed to prevent conflict between personal interests and official duties.  A copy of the Code, taken from the Public Officers Law, is included as <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="../Appendices/APPEN04.html">Appendix IV</A>
<dt><br>
B.	<b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="b">ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT</A></b>
  <dt><br>
	<Dt>The Ethics in Government Act (1987) represents a commitment to integrity and accountability in our government.  The Act is designed to prevent conflict between personal interests and official duties of State officers and employees.  The Act places limitations on outside activities by State policy-makers only. Rules governing outside activities are given in <A HREF="../Appendices/APPEN06.html">Appendix VI. </A>
<dt><br>
 C.	<strong><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="c">AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</A> </strong>
<dt><br>
	<dt>New York State's policy is that equal opportunity be assured in the State's personnel system and affirmative action provided in its administration, in accordance with the requirements of the State's Human Rights Law, the mandates of Title VII of the Federal Civil Rights Act, as amended, and the Governor's Executive Order No. 6 (1983).  The Department of Civil Service is responsible for enforcing that policy and for developing comprehensive statewide affirmative action policies, goals, objectives, and implementation strategies.  Each state agency is required to develop a written affirmative action program and include specific goals and timetables for the prompt achievement of full and equal employment opportunities for minorities, women, disabled persons, and Vietnam era veterans, at all occupational levels of State government.  The Governor's Executive Committee for Affirmative Action advises the Governor and assists the President of the Civil Service Commission in the formulation, coordination, and effective implementation of all State departments' and agencies' affirmative action programs.  A copy of Executive Order No. 6 is included as <A HREF="../Appendices/APPEN07.html">Appendix VII.</A>
<dt><br>
D.<strong>	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="d">SEXUAL HARASSMENT</A> </strong>
 <dt><br>
	<dt>A statewide policy declares that the State will not tolerate sexual harassment in the workplace.  Sexual harassment is considered a form of employee misconduct.  The State has served notice that it will impose sanctions on individuals engaging in such conduct and on supervisory and managerial personnel who knowingly allow such behavior to continue.  As with other cases of discrimination, formal complaints should be handled through the affirmative action officer.  A copy of New York State's policy statement on sexual harassment, Executive Order No. 19, in included as <A HREF= "../Appendices/APPEN08.html:>Appendix VIII.</A>
<dt><br>
E.	<strong><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="e">SEXUAL ORIENTATION</A> </strong>
<dt><br>     
	<dt>Executive Order No. 28 asserts that all State agencies and departments shall prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in any matter related to State employment and shall not discriminate on such basis in the provision of services or benefits.
<dt><br>
	<dt>The Office of Employee Relations was charged with the establishment of guidelines and implementation of procedures for handling complaints to ensure that such discrimination is prevented.  Investigations into complaints of discrimination are conducted with particular regard for confidentiality.  
<dt><br>

<dt><br>
F.	<strong><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="f">DISABLED VETERANS AND VETERANS OF THE VIETNAM ERA</A> </strong>
<dt><br>
	<dt>Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 prohibits job discrimination and requires Affirmative Action to employ and advance in employment:  (1) qualified Vietnam Era Veterans during the first four years after their discharge, and (2) qualified disabled veterans throughout their working lives if they have a 30 percent or more disability.
<dt><br>
G.	<strong><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="g">DISABLED PERSONS</A> </strong>
<dt><br>    
	<dt>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides that no  otherwise qualified disabled individual, as defined in Section 7(6) of that Act, shall, solely by reason of his/her disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.  The Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in employment, public service, public accommodation, transportation, and telecommunications. 
<dt><br>
H.	<strong><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="h">AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT</A> </strong>
<dt><br>
	<dt>The Age Discrimination in Employment Act was passed by Congress in 1967 to provide legal protection for the employment rights of people from 40 to 65 years old.  Congress amended the Act in 1978 to extend protection to 70 years of age, and further amended it in 1986 to abolish mandatory retirement at any age by removing the upper limit on the protected age group under the statute.
<dt><br>
<dt>I.	<strong><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="i">GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES</A> </strong>
<dt><br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1.	<i><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="1">MANAGERIAL/CONFIDENTIAL EMPLOYEES (M/C)</A></i>
<dt><br>
	<dt>Executive Order No. 42 establishes procedures for the submission, review, and settlement of M/C grievances.  An M/C employee has the right to grieve matters free from interference, coercion, restraint, discrimination, or reprisal.  An employee may present his or her case at each step established by the grievance procedure and is entitled to representation at each of these steps.  A copy of the Executive Order is included as <A HREF="../Appendices/APPEN10.html>Appendix X.</A>
<dt><br>    
		<Dt>The initial steps are handled within the employee's agency, beginning with the supervisor and ending with the appointing authority.  The final step of an appeal is heard by the three member Grievance Appeals Board, composed of non-State employees.  The Board reviews those appeals it deems appropriate and may require the personal appearance of the grievant and others.  A copy of the procedures covering M/C employees is available from the Office of Human Resources.
<dt><br>
<dt>2.	<i><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="2">ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES (UUP)</A></i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>With the advent of collective negotiations between the state and employee organizations pursuant to the Public Employees' Fair Employment Act of 1967 negotiated agreements have been entered into which provide for grievance procedures.  Such procedures covering all UUP employees are provided under Article 7 of the Agreement.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<dt><br>
J.	<strong><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="j">POLITICAL ACTIVITIES BY STATE OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES </A></strong>
<dt><br>
	<dt>While a New York State employee is not discouraged from participating in the political process, there must be a clear separation between his/her political activities and the proper discharge of duties as a State employee.  No employee is to conduct political activities on paid State time.  In addition, State equipment, vehicles and office space are to be used only for official business.
<dt><br>
	<dt>Further, an employee of New York State shall not use his/her official authority to influence the political action of any person.  Nor shall appointment to or removal from an office, in any manner, be affected by one's political affiliations Section 107 of the Civil Service Law and Sections 17-156 and 17-158 of the Election Law specify these prohibitions, copies of which are included as <A HREF="../Appendices/APPEN16.html"> Appendix XVI. </A>

	<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
	<dt><A NAME="13H1">1</A>.	<i>DEFINITION</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>A "Special Disabled Veteran," is defined by law as a person who is entitled to compensation (or who but for the receipt of military retired pay would be entitled to compensation) under the laws administered by the Veterans Administration for a disability rated at 30 percent or more; or rated at 10 to 20 percent in the case of a veteran who has been determined under Section 1506 or Title 38, U.S. Code, to have a serious employment handicap; or a person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.
<dt><br>
		<dt>The term "serious employment handicap" means a significant impairment of a veteran's ability to prepare for, obtain, or retain employment consistent with such veteran's abilities, aptitudes, and interests.
<dt><br>
		<dt>The term "Veteran of the Vietnam Era," means a person: (a) who (i) served on active duty for a period of more than 180 days, any part of which occurred during the Vietnam Era (that is, between August 5, 1964 and May 7, 1975), and was discharged or released therefrom with other than a dishonorable discharge, or (ii) was discharged or released from active duty for a service-connected disability if any part of such active duty was performed during the Vietnam Era, and (b) who was so discharged or released within 48 months preceding his application for employment or the alleged violation of the Act, Affirmative Action clause and/or the regulations issued pursuant to the Act.
<dt><br>
		<dt>No veteran may be considered to be a veteran of the Vietnam Era after December 1, 1991.

	<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="13H2">2</A>.	<i>STATEMENT OF POLICY</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 prohibits job discrimination and requires Affirmative Action to employ and advance in employment:  (1) qualified Vietnam Era Veterans during the first four years of their discharge, and (2) qualified disabled veterans throughout their working lives if they have a 30 percent or more disability.
          <dt><br>
		<dt>In accordance with such requirements and with SUNY Potsdam's own policies and programs of equal opportunity and nondiscrimination, the College supports the law which provides that disabled and other veterans of the military services should be given every opportunity to employment and promotion, commensurate with their ability and qualifications to perform the specific jobs for which they may be considered.  This program will be reviewed and updated annually and any significant changes in procedures or rights or benefits as a result of the annual updating will be communicated to employees and applicants for employment.
<dt><br>
		<dt>It is the policy of SUNY Potsdam that no qualified Disabled Veteran or Veteran of the Vietnam Era shall be excluded from College employment or be subject to discrimination in such employment.  The College will employ, advance in employment and otherwise treat Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era Veterans without discrimination in all employment practices including, but not limited to advertising, recruitment, employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer, layoff or termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and selection for training.

	<dt><A NAME="13I2">2</A>. 	<i>STATEMENT OF POLICY</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides that no otherwise qualified handicapped individual, as defined in Section 7(6) of that Act, shall, solely by reason of his/her disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

		<dt><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990">The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990</A> prohibits discrimination against individuals in employment, public service, public accommodations, transportations and telecommunications.
<dt><br>
		<dt>In accordance with such requirements and with the College's own policies and programs of equal opportunity and non- discrimination, the College has adopted this revised Affirmative Action Plan for Disabled Persons.  It supports the law which provides that qualified disabled persons should be given every opportunity for employment, training and promotion commensurate with their ability and qualifications to perform the specific jobs for which they may be considered.  This program will be reviewed and updated annually and any significant changes in procedures and rights or benefits as a result of the annual updating will be communicated to employees and applicants for employment.

	<A NAME="13J">J</A>.	<b>THE AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT</b>

	<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
	<dt><A NAME="13J1">1</A>.	<i>POLICY AND INTENT</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The Age Discrimination in Employment Act was passed by Congress in 1967 to provide legal protection for the employment rights of people from 40 to 65 years old.  Congress amended the Act in 1978 to extend protection to 70 years of age, and further amended it in 1986 to abolish mandatory retirement at any age by removing the upper limit on the protected age group under the statute.
          <dt><br>
		<dt>It is unlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire, to discharge or otherwise to discriminate because of age against any individual between ages 40 and 70 with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.  This includes practices that are neutrally applied with no intent to discriminate, but which have a discriminatory impact on older employees or applicants and are not justified by business necessity.
<dt><br>
		<dt>It is also unlawful to limit, segregate, or classify employees, or to classify or refuse to refer for employment any individual, in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual who is at least 40 years of age of employment opportunities, or otherwise adversely affect his or her status as an employee or as an applicant for employment, because of such individual's age.
<dt><br>
		<dt>With the exception of executive and high policy making employees at least 65 years of age and who have been employed during a two-year period before retirement in such capacity and who are entitled to an immediate nonforfeitable employer-financed pension or deferred compensation plan of at least $44,000 per year, it is unlawful to forcibly retire an employee.
<dt><br>
		<dt>It is also unlawful to run help-wanted advertisements that indicate any preference, limitation, specification, or discrimination based on age.  (Example:  It is unlawful to specify in advertisements that an organization will hire only persons receiving social security benefits.)
<dt><br>
		<dt>It is unlawful to give preference because of age to one person over another within the age 40 to 70 protected group.  (Example:  It is unlawful to give preference to a 45-year-old job applicant over a 60-year-old-job applicant solely because of age.)

	<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="13J2">2</A>.	<i>AGE ACT EXEMPTIONS</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Age Act exemptions apply when:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt>a)	Age is a bona fide job qualification (BFOQ) reasonably necessary to the normal operations of a particular business.  (Example:  public safety concern relating to piloting of commercial aircraft; modeling of clothes for teen-agers.)
<dt><br>
		<dt>b)	Differentiations are based on reasonable factors other than age.  (Example:  Use of physical examinations were stringent physical requirements are necessary to perform the work.)
<dt><br>
		<dt>c)	Differentiations are based on the terms of a bona fide seniority system or bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement pension, or insurance plan which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the Act.
<dt><br>
		<dt.d)	An employee is discharged or otherwise disciplined for good cause.
</dl><!-- 2 -->
</dl>
<dt>
	<A NAME="13K">K</A>.	<b>CHANNELS FOR DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS </b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>Resolution of difficulties through informal meetings of the parties is encouraged.  There are procedures for complaints alleging discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, handicap, marital status and, by reference, status as a disabled veteran or Veteran of the Vietnam Era.  These are available from the Assistant to President for Affirmative Action.

<dt><A NAME="12A22d">d</A>)	Equipment Inventory Procedure
<dt><br>
			<dt>The following procedures outline SUNY Potsdam's equipment inventory process to insure compliance with various requirements and regulations.  This process applies to all state owned equipment, or research foundation equipment, gifts to the College and all other equipment that requires control in the Property Control System, hereafter referred to as PCS.
<dt><br>
<dt>The process begins when a purchase order is sent to a vendor.  All items ordered by the College must be received by our Stores Clerk in Central Receiving.
<dt><br>
<dt>The following steps outline the exact procedure from the issuance of a purchase order to the delivery of an item to the user department.  Exceptions do occur and are handled on an individual basis by our Equipment Coordinator.
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	a copy of all purchase orders are given to the Office of Physical Plant where equipment in need of control is identified.  Prior to the receipt of the item a decal number is assigned and sent to Central Receiving.
<dt><br>
			<dt>ii)	all items are shipped to Central Receiving for receipt.  The Central Receiving department uses the SURS which is a part of the purchasing and accounting systems.
<dt><br>
			<dt>iii)	once an item is received, it is decaled and engraved, if required, at Central Receiving prior to it being delivered to the user department.
<dt><br>
			<dt>iv)	after the item has been delivered, all required information, which is recorded by our Stores Clerk, is forwarded to the Equipment Coordinator for inclusion in the PCS.
<dt><br>
			<dt>v)	equipment that does not receive a numbered decal due to its dollar value receives an ownership tag at Central Receiving prior to its being delivered to the user department.
<dt><br>
			<dt>vi)	items are processed for payment by the Accounting department after a match has been made between the receipt report and their voucher system.

<dt><A NAME="12A23"><i>23</A>.	EXIT INTERVIEWS</i>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
<dt><A NAME="12A23a">a</A>)	Purpose
<dt><br>
			<dt>Exit interviews serve a worthwhile function as an "informational exchange" tool.  The employee can be informed as to the procedures for continuing benefits, returning state property, payment of vacation accruals, withdrawal of retirement contributions, obtaining final paycheck, etc.  The employer can benefit by exploring feelings about job satisfaction in an effort to identify training needs, lack of competitive salaries, fringe benefits, promotional opportunities, identify the need for organizational change or areas with unique demands and frustrations, identify soundness of personnel selection process or problematic supervisory styles, and create goodwill, among other things.

<dt><A NAME="12A25"><I>25.	FACULTY UTILIZATION POLICY</I>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The policy of SUNY Potsdam on faculty utilization reflects the criteria of the Board of Trustees of the State University of New York for the evaluation of academic employees (Policies of the Board of Trustees, Article XII, Title A) and the practice which has been in effect for many years at the College.
          <dt><br>
<dt>While the primary responsibility of full-time faculty at SUNY Potsdam is academic instruction, other responsibilities include, but are not limited to, academic advising, research and/or creative activities, continuing professional development, and campus and community service.
<dt><br>
<dt>Full-time faculty at SUNY Potsdam normally carry 12 semester hours each semester.  These 12 semester hours are not limited to standard classroom teaching, but may include contact with students in credit-bearing lab sections, research seminars, and other learning modes.  Responsibilities are not determined on the basis of student load (i.e., a professor who teaches one or more large sections is not automatically given a course load reduction).  Low-enrolled courses (e.g., fewer than 12 students in a lower division course; fewer than
9 students in an upper division course) are reviewed by the dean for possible cancellation and substitution of a higher demand course.  Some faculty also teach tutorials and direct research projects for a few students.  Schedules are reviewed before and after pre-registration to assure the effective use of faculty resources while allowing the continuation of courses that are essential to major or other programs.
<dt><br>
<dt>Currently, variations on the normal expectations of teaching load are determined by the Deans, the Provost and, in some cases, by the President.  Faculty may apply for a course reduction for research and other scholarly activity through the Department and the Department Chair to the Dean's office.  Such applications state the purpose of the reduction and carry with them the recommendation of the Department and the Department Chair.  Decisions on requested reductions are made by the Provost in consultation with the appropriate dean.  
<dt><br>
<dt>In addition to the reduction granted for department chairs, a reduction in teaching assignment may be granted for such reasons as:
<dt><br>
<dd>--	Administrative assignments (e.g., chair of the Faculty Assembly)<br>
		<dd>--	Research and other scholarly activity, as noted above,<br>
		<dd>--	Chair of a major search committee;<br>
		<dd>--	Extraordinary community service.
<dt><br>
		<dt>All full-time faculty are expected to submit an annual report of their activities.  The reports are reviewed by the deans and, in the case of decisions regarding merit pay, reappoint-ment, promotion and the granting of continuing appointment, by the Provost and the President.  Faculty are evaluated, promoted, and receive merit pay increments on the basis of teaching effectiveness, mastery of subject matter, scholarly ability, effectiveness of university service (including advisement of students), public service, and continuing growth.
<dt><br>
<dt>The assessment of faculty utilization is an on-going process.  As stated in the Faculty Handbook "It is the responsibility of the Deans in consultation with the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Department Chairs to develop instructional programs which will result in reasonably equal service to students, the College, and the State of New York from each member of the teaching faculty."  Specifically, the Provost conducts periodic reviews of faculty utilization for each academic department, including an analysis of enrollments, number of majors, general education needs, student/faculty ratios, and SUNY benchmark information.  When vacant lines are available, they are reallocated to different departments in such a way as to maximize the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of the overall academic program.

<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
<dt><A NAME="12A26a">a</A>)	Possession Of Firearms And Weapons
<dt><br>
			<dt>The rules of the Board of Trustees prohibit the possession of firearms or weapons on a State operated campus of the State University of New York without the written authorization of the campus President (or designee).  The Director of Public Safety has been appointed as the President's designee for such purpose.  The fact that a person is in possession of a valid New York State pistol permit does not authorize that person to have a firearm or weapon on campus without such written authorization of the campus President (or designee).
<dt><br>
<dt>Such authorization may be rescinded at any time but in no event shall it be valid for longer than one academic year.
<dt><br>
<dt>Persons who are designated peace officers under authority of the Education Law are not exempt from the firearms licensing requirements of the penal law.  Neither are they exempt from prosecution for possessions of noxious substances.

<dt><A NAME="12A26c">c</A>)	Procedure
              <dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	All faculty, staff and students bringing firearms or weapons to campus must first report directly to the Office of Public Safety to have them properly stored.                   The office is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>ii)	Permission to store the firearms or weapons should then be obtained from the appropriate person.

<dt><A NAME="12A28"><i>28</A>.	GIFTS AND GRATUITIES</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The acceptance of any gift, gratuity, or rewards by an employee from a person or persons with whom she/he does business is forbidden.  If such gifts are received, they must be returned.  The State University employee must adopt an attitude and mode of operation that is above criticism and avoid any type of conduct that would reflect unfairly on the employees of the State University as a whole.

<A NAME="12A"><b>A</a>.	CAMPUS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</b>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A41"><i>41</A>.	PURCHASING</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>In order to comply with State University's basic procurement objective to secure the most appropriate materials, supplies, equipment, services, etc. at the lowest available price, consistent with quality requirements and delivery needs as will best promote the interests of New York State, the following guidelines have been developed:
<dt><br>
<dt>The College's Purchasing Department is charged with the centralized purchasing of all supplies and materials for the campus for the most effective and economical acquisition of products and services with consideration for the benefits of quantity buying, standardization of materials and equipment, the reduction of expensive emergency buying, the use of competitive bidding and the development of new sources of supply to aid in obtaining advantageous prices and achieve maximum use from allocated funds.  The office works with      faculty and staff to determine and implement effective purchasing for specialized and all other instructional research needs, subject to rules and regulations set by the State.
<dt><br>
<dt>The Purchasing Department is responsible for the College's compliance with all State and local purchasing rules, regulations and procedures and, as such, all purchases must be initiated by the Purchasing Department.  All requests for supplies and/or equipment to be purchased from State funds must be submitted directly to the Purchasing Department on the standard requisition form.  It is suggested that individuals retain a copy of each request for their records.  A separate requisition must be completed for each individual source or vendor.  All requisitions must be properly signed.  
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt><A NAME="12A41a">a</A>)	State Contract Items
 <dt><br>
			<dt>The Office of General Services issues state contracts each year for a large number of commodities.  The College is required by law to purchase said supplies and/or equipment from the state contract vendor unless it can be proven that the same item (make and model) can be purchased cheaper from another source.  Individuals should contact the Purchasing Department to obtain      information regarding source, price, delivery and contract items.
<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41b">b</A>)	Non-Contract Items
<dt><br>
			<dt>Commodities not available under centralized contracts may be purchased directly by the College in accordance with State rules and regulations.  It is the policy of The State University of New York to take affirmative action to ensure that minority and women-owned business enterprises (MWBE) are given the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to provide the College with goods and services at competitive prices.  The Purchasing Department maintains a file by vendor and commodity which is available for individual use.  Campus procedures for purchasing non-contract items provide for
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	a review for purchase from minority and/or women-owned business, and preferred sources.
<dt><br>
			<dt>ii)	a review for purchases of similar commodities from the same vendor within the previous sixty (60) days
<dt><br>
			<dt>iii)	a vendor of choice with no competitive bidding and a review for a reasonable price for purchases under     $500
<dt><br>
			<dt>iv)	solicitation of prices and a review for a reasonable price for purchases from $500 up to $2500
<dt><br>
			<dt>v)	solicitation of a minimum of three (3) bids (verbal, written or sealed) for purchases in excess of $2500 and up to $5000
<dt><br>
			<dt>vi)	solicitation in writing of a minimum of five (5) sealed bids for purchases in excess of $5000 and up to $10,000
<dt><br>
			<dt>vii)	minimum of five (5) sealed bids for purchases in excess of $10,000 and up to $20,000.  In addition, notification to all bidders on SUNY/Campus bid list for the particular commodity OR insertion in the New York State Contract Reporter is required.
<dt><br>
			<dt>viii)	consultation with the Office of General Services (OGS), minimum of five (5) sealed bids and insertion in the New York State Contract Reporter for purchases in excess of $20,000. 
<dt><br>
			<dt>ix)	solicitation of a minimum of five (5) bids (written or sealed) for all printing requests up to $10,000, with printing requests in excess of $10,000 requiring prior approval of the Controllers Office.
</dl><!-- 3 -->
<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41c">c</A>)	Storehouse
 <dt><br>
			<dt>Storehouse items must be submitted on a separate requisition and prices should be verified against the College storehouse stocklist before submission.  The College storehouse list should also be checked before requesting merchandise from other sources.
<dt><br>
		<dt><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="12A41d">d</A>)	Bookstore Purchases
 <dt><br>
			<dt>Before purchasing items at the Campus Bookstore, individuals should verify with the Purchasing Department whether the merchandise is already in stock or covered by State contract.  Bookstore personnel will issue an invoice indicating your departmental appropriation number and total cost.  This should be submitted immediately to the Purchasing Department on the standard requisition form.
<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41e">e</A>)	Equipment
 <dt><br>
			<dt>All equipment purchased by the College must be entered immediately into the equipment inventory.  No equipment may be removed, relocated, or in any other way be disposed of without the prior written approval of the Office of Physical Plant.
<dt><br>
<dt>All requests for repairs to any State owned equipment must be processed through the Purchasing Department.
<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41f">f</A>)	Service Contracts
 <dt><br>
			<dt>Service Contracts are required for any service rendered in a fiscal year that exceeds $5000.  This includes typewriter maintenance, piano tuning, linen rental, non-credit instructors, installment or lease purchases, etc.  The procedures governing these contracts are lengthy and may require up to ninety days lead time.  Details and guidelines are available from the Office of Business Affairs.  
<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41g">g</A>)	Library Acquisitions
<dt><br>
			<dt>Expenses charged to Library acquisitions are initiated by the Library and are not subject to the above regulations.  Expenses chargeable to Library S&E must, however, still follow the stated regulations.

		<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41h">h</A>)	Monetary Limitations and Responsibilities
 <dt><br>
			<dt>The State Finance Law requires that bids be solicited for all requests in excess of $2500.  Depending on the commodity and the monetary value, different procedures are followed.  For further clarification, please check with the Purchasing Office.
<dt><br> 
<dt>The State Finance Law expressly states that no purchase liability shall be incurred except by issuance of a purchase order.  Merchandise ordered and received without the issuance of a purchase order becomes the personal obligation of the individual ordering.  Authority is lodged solely in the Purchasing Agent to create any financial obligation between the College and any other party.  This applies to purchases, memoranda of understanding, agreements, contracts or any other      document resulting in payment of funds by the College.
 <dt><br>
<dt>Faculty and staff are cautioned that the law of Agency applies to any transaction improperly entered into without authority in which case the individual is personally liable for any and all payment(s) due other parties.

		<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41i">i</A>)	Receiving
 <dt><br>
			<dt>Central Receiving is responsible for verifying that all state and non-state contract items purchased with state funding are physically received.  All items delivered to the College must be sent directly to Central Receiving.  All hand carried orders or yellow book authorizations picked up by College employees must be taken to Central Receiving for proper identification.  Exceptions to this rule may require Central Receiving staff to go out into the field to inspect shipments of goods which for one reason or another were unable to pass through Central Receiving.  Repairs will be verified by appropriate departmental supervisors.

		<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41j">j</A>)	Emergency Purchases
<dt><br>
			<dt>State University Purchasing and Contracting procedures (Procedures Manual Item 300) defines an emergency purchase as follows:
<dt><br>
	<dt>"An emergency purchase must involve an accident or unforeseen occurrence requiring immediate action; it is       unanticipated or fortuitous; it is a sudden or unexpected occasion for action and involves a pressing necessity.  The conditions must be such that unless corrected without delay, death, injury or serious property damage would result.  Where such conditions exist, the waiver of competitive bidding requirements must be approved in writing by the campus President or appropriate designee to provide for adequate internal control."
<dt><br>
			<dt>All emergency situations must be documented in writing by the designee.  The President's designee for determining emergency situations is the Director of Business Affairs.

		<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41k">k</A>)	Purchasing From College Employees
 <dt><br>
			<dt>Item No. 4, Section 73 of the Public Officers Law states:
<dt><br>
				<dt>"No officer or employee of a state agency, member of the legislature or legislative employee or firm or association of which such person is a member, or corporation, ten per cent or more of the stock of which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such person, shall sell any goods or services having a value in excess of twenty-five dollars to any state agency unless pursuant to an award or contract let after public notice and competitive bidding (emphasis added).
<dt><br>
			<dt>In accordance with the above, the purchase of goods or services in excess of $25 from College employees can only be made as a result of a competitive bidding process.

<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A42"><i>42</A>.	REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION POLICY</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="ADA">The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</A> of 1990 mandates that employers make reasonable accommodations for otherwise qualified employees with disabilities, unless it can be demonstrated that providing such accommodations would result in undue financial or operational hardships.  To date, most employee requests for reasonable accommodations under both the ADA and its antecedent, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, have been addressed directly by the employee's supervisor or department chair.  While department chairs and supervisors are encouraged to continue responding directly to requests from individuals with disabilities, there may be occasions when making a decision about accommodations is complicated by other factors.  For instance, the need for an accommodation may be obvious, or it may be difficult to determine what constitutes a reasonable accommodation, or a department's budget may be unable to absorb the total cost of providing the accommodation requested.  The following procedure has been developed to ensure that employee requests for reasonable accommodations are treated in as consistent and equitable a fashion as possible.
<dt><br>
<dt>Procedure for Requesting and Receiving Reasonable Accommodations
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
			<dt>1)	The employee requesting an accommodation obtains, completes, and forwards to his or her department chair or supervisor and Application for Reasonable Accommodation(s).
<dt><br>
			<dt>2)	The department chair or supervisor completes the second half of the Application for Reasonable Accommodation, returns one copy to the individual requesting the accommodation, and forwards one copy to the Dean, who will forward the request to the Human Resources Office.  The Human Resources Office notifies the employee of the disposition of the request for accommodation(s) within two weeks of receiving the application.
<dt><br>
			<dt>3)	If the department chair or supervisor states on the Application for Reasonable Accommodation that the department can provide the requested accommodation directory without additional documentation or assistance, the application process is complete, and the department proceeds with necessary arrangement.  The Application for Reasonable Accommodation remains on file in the Human Resources Office for recordkeeping purposes only.
<dt><br>
			<dt>4)	If the department chair or supervisor states on the Application for Reasonable Accommodation that the department or unit is prevented from directly accommodating the request due solely to budgetary considerations, and if it is determined that the request or some mutually agreed upon variation thereof may be accommodated without undue financial hardship to the institution as a whole, the Human Resources Office contacts the appropriate dean or director, who then assists in locating funds through channels within his or her own division.  It is expected that required job accommodations will usually be funded directly by the employee's department or unit.
<dt><br>
			<dt>5)	If the department chair or supervisor states on the Applications for Reasonable Accommodation that the department lacks information necessary for making a decision about the request, the request is referred to the Director of Human Resources, who notifies the applicant of the need for additional information.
<dt><br>
			<dt>6)	If the procedure for requesting and receiving reasonable accommodations is not completed before step 5, the Application for Reasonable Accommodation as well as all additional information and supporting documentation is forwarded to the Human Resources Office for review by the Director of Human Resources and/or her designee.  If, based on the review, the Director of Human Resources determines that the employee is entitled to an accommodation and that the proposed accommodation is reasonable as defined by the ADA, she will consult with the employee's supervisor about appropriate methods of implementing the requested accommodation or some variation thereof.
<dt><br>
			<dt>7)	If a review of the request and of supporting documentation is inconclusive, or if it is determined that medical documentation is inadequate or otherwise problematic, the Director of Human Resources and/or her designee, after consulting with the Provost, will specify to the applicant why the documentation is unacceptable, and the applicant will be allowed to submit additional supporting documentation.  If, after this additional documentation has been submitted, the need for an accommodation is still not clearly established, the employee may be asked to submit to a medical examination by an appropriate medical professional designated and paid for by the College.  The submitted medical documentation and reports from medical exams will be used solely to assist the appropriate College officials in making an informed decision about the employee's request for accommodation.  All such documentation will be held in the strictest of confidence and kept separate from personnel records.
<dt><br>
			<dt>8)	While the College may seek technical assistance from  a medical professional, State or local rehabilitation agencies or disability constituent organizations in determining how to accommodate a particular individual in a specific situation, the decision as to what is and what is not an appropriate accommodation is made by the College.  If the individual requesting an accommodation is made by the College.  If the individual requesting an accommodation believes that a decision to deny the request was based on illegal discrimination, complaints may be filed with either the New York State Division of Human Rights or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

	<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A47"><i>47</A>.	RESPONDING TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>SUNY Potsdam is committed to the free exchange of ideas between people of different social and political systems.  It is the policy of the College to encourage such interaction.  The College also believes that its employees should cooperate with and assist officials of government agencies when appropriate.  While the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), commonly known as the Buckley Amendment, forbids staff members from providing certain information, the College neither requires its employees to answer questions posed by representatives of government agencies nor forbids its staff from responding to such inquiries.  Faculty and staff can obtain information on FERPA from the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Services and can obtain assistance from his office in case of doubt about whether to respond to government officials.

	<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A48"><i>48</A>.	RESPONDING TO LEGAL AGENCIES</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The Office of Human Resources is responsible for the coordination of the responses of a legal nature on this campus.  A part of this responsibility includes overseeing of official responses to requests for information and data from off-campus legal agencies such as the Office of University Counsel, the Office of the Attorney General and Attorneys at Law.
<dt><br>
<dt>The Director of Human Resources, should be informed of all requests for information from such sources.  These requests arrive with some frequency and often ask for similar information from various campus sources.  Coordination of replies is necessary to insure that proper procedures are followed and correct information is disseminated.
<dt><br>
		<dt>In addition, the Director is designated as the official campus liaison with the Office of the State University Counsel.  University Counsel is the legal advisor to the University.  Individual employees and departments requiring legal advice and opinion pertaining to College affairs should make initial contact with the Director and should forward to the Director copies of relevant correspondence.
<dt><br>
<dt>Your cooperation is appreciated and will insure consistency in our campus procedures and responses.

</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 0 -->
	I.	EMPLOYEE EXPOSURE DETERMINATION
<dt><br>
		<dt>OSHA requires employers to perform an exposure determination concerning which employees may incur occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials.  The exposure determination is made without regard to the use of personal protective equipment (i.e. employees are considered to be exposed even if they wear personal protective equipment).  This exposure determination is required to list all job classifications in which all employees may be expected to incur such occupational exposure, regardless of frequency.  At this college the following job classifications are in this category:
<dt><br>
	<dd>Campus Public Safety Officer<br>
	<dd>Supervising Campus Public Safety Officer<br>
	<dd>Director of Public Safety<br>
	<dd>Supervisor of College Nursing Services<br>
	<dd>Nurse I<br>
	<dd>Director of Student Health<br>
	<dd>Licensed Practical Nurse<br>
	<dd>College Physicians Assistant<br>
	<dd>Athletic Trainer<br>
	<dd>Laboratory Supervisor
<dt><br>
<dt>In addition, OSHA requires a listing of job classifications in which some employees in these categories would be expected to incur exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials, tasks or procedures that would cause these employees to have occupational exposure are also required to be listed in order to clearly understand which employees in these categories are considered to have occupational exposure.  The job classifications and associated tasks for these categories are as follows:
<dt><br>
<center>
<table>
	<tr><th>Job Classification</th>         <th>Tasks/Procedures</th></tr>
<tr></tr>
	<tr><td>Cleaner/Janitor</td>             <td>Laundry, Cleaning in</td></tr>

	III.	METHODS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND CONTROL
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt>1.0	Universal Precautions
<dt><br>
		<dt>1.1	As of March 6, 1992, all employees will utilize Universal Precautions.  Universal Precautions is an infection control method which requires employees to assume that all human blood and specified human body fluids are infectious for HIV, HBV, and other bloodborne pathogens (see Appendix A) and must be treated accordingly.
<dt><br>
		<dt>2.0	Exposure Control Plan (ECP)
<dt><br>
		<dt>2.1	Employees covered by the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard will receive an explanation of this ECP during their initial training session.  It will also be reviewed in their annual refresher training.  All employees will have an opportunity to review this Plan at any time during their work shifts by contacting the Pyscical Plant Office.  Employees seeking copies of the Plan may contact the Physical Plant Office.  A copy of the Plan will be made available free of charge and within 15 days of the request.
<dt><br>
		<dt>2.2	The Environmental Health and Safety Office will also be responsible for reviewing and updating the ECP annually or sooner if necessary to reflect any new or modified tasks and procedures which affect occupational exposure and to reflect new or revised employee positions with occupational exposure. 
<dt><br>
		<dt>3.0	Engineering Controls and Work Practices		
<dt><br>
		<dt>3.1	Engineering controls and work practice controls will be used to prevent or minimize exposure to bloodborne pathogens.  The specific engineering controls and work practice controls we will use and where they will be used are contained in the Student Health Exposure Plan and include:
<dt><br>
<dt>-	puncture-resistant disposal containers for contaminated sharps, or broken glass
<dt><br>
			<dt>- 	providing readily accessible hand washing facilities
<dt><br>
			<dt>- 	washing hands immediately or as soon as feasible after removal of gloves                                        
<dt><br>
			<dt>-	washing body parts as soon as possible after skin contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials occurs, prohibiting the recapping or bending of needles
<dt><br>
			<dt>-	labeling
<dt><br>
			<dt>-	prohibiting eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or lip balm and handling contact lenses in work areas where there is a likelihood of occupational exposure
<dt><br>
			<dt>-	prohibiting food and drink from being kept in refrigerators, freezers, shelves, cabinets or on counter tops or bench tops where blood or other potentially infectious materials are present
<dt><br>
			<dt>-	requiring that all procedures involving blood or other potentially infectious materials shall be performed in such a manner as to minimize splashing, splattering, and generation of droplets of these substances
<dt><br>
			<dt>-	new technology for needles and sharps will be evaluated and implemented whenever possible to further prevent accidental needle sticks and cuts.  Our engineering controls (i.e., sharps containers, etc.) will be updated as needed by the Student Health Services every year.
<dt><br>
		<dt>4.0	Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
<dt><br>
		<dt>4.1	Personal protective equipment must also be used if occupational exposure remains after instituting engineering and work practice controls, or if controls are not feasible.  Training will be provided by the Supervisor in the use of the appropriate personal protective equipment for employees' specific job classifications and tasks/procedures they will perform.
<dt><br>
<dt>Additional training will be provided, whenever necessary, such as if an employee takes a new position or if new duties are added to her/his current position.
<dt><br>
<dt>Appropriate personal protective equipment is required for the following tasks; the specific equipment to be used is listed after the task:
<dt><br>
<center>
<table>
               <tr><th>Task</th>                                     <th>Equipment</th></tr>

Replace gloves if torn, punctured, contaminated, or if their ability to function as a barrier is compromised.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>-	Following any contact of body areas with blood or any other infectious materials, you must wash your hands and any other exposed skin with soap and water as soon as possible.  Employees must also flush exposed mucous membranes (eyes, mouth, etc.) with water.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>-	Wear appropriate face and eye protection such as a mask with glasses with solid side shields or a chin-length face shield when splashes, sprays, spatters, or droplets of blood or other potentially infectious materials pose a hazard to the eye, nose, or mouth.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>-	If a garment is penetrated by blood and other potentially infectious materials, the garment(s) must be removed immediately or as soon as feasible.

<A NAME="10A6"><i>6</a>.	ORIENTATION PROGRAMS</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>SUNY Potsdam offers all new students a formal opportunity to become acquainted with its academic programs, facilities, faculty and staff.  Orientation occurs after admission and prior to matriculation.  All students (including freshmen, transfers and adult learners) who will be entering during the fall semester are invited to attend.  For mid-year matriculants, there is an additional session held just before classes begin in January.
<dt><br>
		<dt>The primary function of orientation is to assist students in their transition to the SUNY Potsdam environment.  A significant part of that process is working individually with an experienced academic adviser and selecting one's courses.  Other activities typically include discussions of graduation requirements, introductions to various academic and social policies, discussions of financial aid, meeting with the staff of such offices as Residence Life and developing familiarity with numerous College services.  In conjunction with the freshman sessions, there are also separate parallel parent orientation programs.  Orientation programs are coordinated by the Office of New Student Programs.

<A NAME="10A7"><i>7</a>.	RESIDENCE LIFE</i>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<A NAME="10A7a">a</a>)	Residence Halls 
<dt><br>
			<dt>Students have many options as to living arrangements, including single room, double, or suite in co-ed or all-male or all-female facilities.  Special interest housing options compliment the residential program. The residence halls are staffed with professionals, paraprofessionals and upper-class students  who serve as Resident Assistants helping students adjust to college life and deal with various contemporary problems.  There is one Resident Assistant for every 25 students.

<dt><br>
<A NAME="10A7b">b</a>)	College Housing Policy
<dt><br>
			<dt>All students are required to live on campus until they have accumulated 88 credits toward graduation.  Students transferring to Potsdam are required to live for at least one year on-campus. Transfer students should contact the Residence Life Office as to their status.  Exceptions may be made for students living at home, for married students, and veterans on a case by case basis decided by the Director of Residence Life. 

<dt><br>
<A NAME="10A7c">c)	Programming
<dt><br>
			<dt>SUNY Potsdam is able to house approximately two-thirds of its students in residence halls on the campus.  While the primary purpose of these residences is obviously to provide students with a place to reside while pursuing their studies at the College, their existence presents a great opportunity to promote  a living/learning environment.
<dt><br>
			<dt>The existence of these accommodations has allowed SUNY Potsdam to become primarily a residential college.  The College views residential life as a fundamental component of the Potsdam educational experience.  Residences are not simply a convenient place to live, but, in the Potsdam context, are units in which the intellectual, social, and cultural development of students is promoted.  The Residence Hall environment can promote student development and learning throughout the institution.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Given this perception of the role of student residences, educational, social, and cultural programming is far more than an agreeable supplement to residence life.  Educational programming, particularly that which is integrated with academic units, is a crucial part of the residential experience.  Such programming should be diverse and varied and implemented in conjunction with academic units.  It should provide students with a choice of living situations, and it should stress the integration of campus life, curricular and co-curricular.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Residence Hall programming is developed in numerous ways.  Some programming originates with, and is implemented, by students.  Other programming is developed by faculty and staff, with the expectation that students will find this programming of benefit. The Residence Life staff experiments and takes original approaches to programming.  They study successful programs at other institutions and replicate them where appropriate.
<dt><br>
			<dt>While sound management practices and fiscal responsibility are essential, Residence Life is not be construed as a business or as a profit making venture.  Its main purpose is to advance the academic, intellectual, and social development of students and to assist in the achievement of the academic goals of the College.  
<dt><br>
			<dt>Stress is placed on the comfort of students and on the creation of a congenial living environment, and students are treated at all times as participants in rather than involuntary residents of the system.  To the extent possible, students have a share in the governance of residences and in the development of policies. They are consulted not only on programming but also on budgetary matters, including the establishment of room rental rates.  It is important to note, however, that extensive consultation does not mean the yielding of control:  the Office of Residence Life remains accountable to the institution both for the management of residences and also for the furtherance of the institution's academic goals.

<dt><blockquote><A NAME="5A9"><i>9.	CONTINUATION IN RETIREMENT</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>If you meet the minimum employment requirements set forth below at the time of your retirement from State service, you will be eligible to continue your coverage, and that of your enrolled dependents, into retirement.  As an enrolled retiree, your coverage will be continued under the option in which you were enrolled at time of retirement, although you may elect to change options.  However, if you were formerly a member of a bargaining unit and eligible to receive benefits from a union's Employee Benefit Fund or special benefits negotiated for members of your unit, there may be some change in benefits and/or the method of obtaining them after retirement.
<dt><br>
		<dt>The requirements for continuation of coverage in retirement are as follows:                    

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>a)	An employee whose most recent date of employment in State service is prior to April 1, 1975, may continue health insurance coverage in retirement provided that at the time of retirement the employee:

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>i)	has had a least five years of State service, not necessarily continuous, or has had at least five years of combined service with the State and one or more Participating Agencies; and
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>ii)	has retired as a member of a retirement system administered by the State of New York or any of its political subdivisions; or be enrolled in the optional retirement plan offered by TIAA-CREF,

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>(1) is at least 55 years of age, or

				</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>(2) has qualified for Social Security disability payments and has had at least ten years of State service in the case of an ordinary disability retirement and
</dl>
			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>iii)	is enrolled in a New York State Health Insurance Plan at the time of retirement.
</dl>
		</dl>
<dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>b)	An employee whose most recent date of employment in State service is on or after April 1, 1975, may continue health  insurance coverage in retirement provided the employee:

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>i)	has had at least 10 years of State service, not necessarily continuous, or has had at least ten years of combined service with the State and one or more Participating Agencies; and

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>ii)	has retired as a member of a retirement system administered by the State of New York or one of its political subdivisions; or be enrolled in the optional retirement plan offered by TIAA-CREF
<dt><br>
				<dd>(1) is at least 55 years of age if employment began with     NYS prior to 9/1/83,
				<dd>(2) is at least age 62 if employment began with NYS                              on or after 9/1/83;
				<dd>(3) has qualified for Social Security disability                              payments and

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>iii)	is enrolled in a New York State Health Insurance Plan at the time of retirement.
<dt><br>
				<dt>NOTE:  The five and ten-year minimum service requirements do not apply in the case of a disability retirement resulting from a work-incurred illness or injury.  In such cases, no minimum period of service is required.
<dt><br>
			<dt>An employee who is eligible to continue health insurance coverage into retirement is entitled to use their accumulated unused sick leave, up to a maximum of 165 days to offset all or part of the cost of their health insurance coverage during retirement.  An employee's sick leave is converted into a dollar amount by dividing the total dollar value of sick leave by the employee's actuarial life expectancy in months.  The result is a lifetime monthly credit which is applied to the employee's health insurance premium for as long as he/she remains enrolled in a New York State Health Insurance Plan.  Although the cost of health insurance coverage may change, the amount of monthly credit remains the same throughout the retirees lifetime, thereby resulting in an increase in premium that the retiree will have to pay.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Credit for unused sick leave may be provided only if the employee meets both of the following provisions:
<dt><br>
				<dt><blockquote>the employee's compensation is paid directly by the State; and
<dt><br>
				<dt>the employee is subject to a plan administered by law, rule, regulation, written order or written policy which provides for the regular earning and accumulation of sick leave.</blockquote>

<dt><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="5A9c">c)</A>	Dual Annuitant Sick Leave Credit
<dt><br>
			<dd>Effective 1/1/89 for M/C Employees<br>
			<dd>Effective 9/1/91 for Employees represented by UUP
<dt><br>
			<dt>At the time of retirement, an employee may specify that they would like their dependent survivors to be able to use their monthly sick leave credit towards the cost of their health insurance premium if they should die.  If an employee wishes to choose this option, it must be done before the last day on the payroll.
<dt><br>
<dt>This benefit allows an employee to select 70% of their sick leave credits towards the cost of the health insurance premium for as long as they live.  If the enrollee should die, his/her dependents may continue to use the 70% of the monthly credit for their health insurance premium.  The opportunity to elect Dual Annuitant Sick Leave is available only once, at the time of retirement.  Once this is elected it may not be discontinued.  If an enrollee's dependents should predecease him/her, the enrollee will maintain the 70% sick leave credit.

		</dl>
<dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="5A9d">d)</A>	Deferred Health Insurance Coverage for Retirees
<dt><br>
			<dt>Employees that retire may elect to delay the start of their health insurance coverage in retirement.  During this deferment period, enrollees who have health insurance coverage through their spouse's employer and through post-retirement employment, do not pay anything to the State Health Insurance Program.  Deferring coverage also means that the retiree's sick leave credit, calculated when the retiree is older, will be higher than it would otherwise be at the time of retirement.
<dt><br>
<dt>If the retiree dies while coverage is deferred, the spouse and/or eligible dependents may transfer back to the State Health Insurance Program.  To elect Deferred Health Insurance Coverage, the enrollee must complete the appropriate form (available through the Office of Human Resources) and furnish proof of continued coverage through a spouse's health care plan or through post-retirement employment.
<dt><br>
<dt>*M/C employees may elect to defer the start of their health insurance coverage indefinitely.  <BR>
** Employees represented by UUP may elect to defer the start of their health insurance coverage for up to 5 years.

<dt><blockquote><A NAME="5A10"><i>10</A>.	DEPENDENT ELIGIBILITY</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The following types of dependents are eligible to be enrolled in the program.  

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>a)	Your spouse, including a legally separated spouse.  If you are divorced, or your marriage has been annulled, your former spouse is not eligible for coverage even if the court orders the coverage to be maintained.  

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>b)	Your unmarried children under 19 years of age. This includes your natural children, legally adopted children, including children in a waiting period prior to the finalization of an adoption, and your dependent step-children.  Other children who reside permanently with you in your household who are chiefly dependent on you, are also eligible.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>c)	Your unmarried children 19 years of age or older but under 25 who receive more than half of their support from you and who are full-time students at an accredited secondary or preparatory school, college or other accredited educational institution, and are otherwise not eligible for employer group coverage.  They continue to be eligible through the month in which they complete course requirements for graduation.  Time spent in US military service, not to exceed four years, may be deducted from the dependent's age for the purpose of establishing eligibility for coverage.
<dt><br>
<dt>Unmarried dependent children over age 19, but under age 25, are also eligible when less than full-time course work is needed to satisfy the requirements for graduation as long as i) the child was a full-time student in the term immediately preceding the semester or trisemester in which course requirements will be completed, and ii) be able to provide a statement from the school or college administrator which certifies the student's status. If the above criteria are met, the child will be eligible for dependent student status through the end of the month in which he/she completes course requirements for graduation.  Coverage will not be extended beyond this semester or trimester unless full-time student status is resumed.
<dt><br>
<dt>An enrolled dependent child whose 19th birthday occurs during school vacation period will continue to be covered under the program, provided the child is enrolled in a school and it is anticipated the child will resume full-time student status at the end of the vacation period.
<dt><br>
<dt>In the event a dependent student is disabled and is granted a medical leave by the school he or she is attending, health insurance coverage will be continued for a maximum of one year from the month in which the student withdraws from school plus  any time before the start of the next regular semester.  Written documentation must be provided from the school and physician.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>d)	Your unmarried child 19 years of age or older who is incapable of self-support by reason of mental or physical disability and who became so incapable before reaching age 19.
<dt><br>
<dt>The eligibility of such a dependent should be established as early as possible.  This should be done at the time of your initial enrollment if the child is age 19 or older at that time. If the child has not attained age 19 at the time you first enroll in the program, eligibility for continued coverage should be established at the time of his, or her, 19th birthday.

</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>e)	Your domestic partner.  A domestic partner is defined as one in which the partners must be 18 years of age or older, unmarried and not related by marriage or blood in a way that would bar marriage, reside together, involved in a committed (lifetime) rather than casual relationship and mutually interdependent financially.  The partners must be each other's sole domestic partner and must have been involved in the domestic partnership for a period of not less than six (6) months.
<dt><br>
			<dt>The Office of Human Resources can provide the forms and instructions necessary to establish eligibility.
</dl>
	</dl>


<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>11.	<A NAME="11">DOMESTIC PARTNER BENEFIT</A><BR>
<BR>


			Pursuant to language in the agreements between New York State and the unions, a domestic partnership is one in which both partners are:  18 years of age or older; unmarried and not related by marriage or blood in a way that would bar marriage; residing together; involved in a committed (lifetime) rather than casual relationship, and mutually interdependent financially.  The partners must be each other's sole domestic partner and must have been involved in the domestic partnership for a period of not less than six (6) months.  The partners must be able to document all of these criteria for the enrollment in a health insurance plan to be permitted.

			<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>a)	Enrolling a Domestic Partner<BR>
<BR>

	
					To begin the enrollment process, please contact Human Resources to obtain the domestic partner enrollment package.  This includes the Affidavit of Domestic partnership, Afficavit of Financial Interdependence, Dependent Tax Affidavit, Termination of Domestic Partnership Form and a Health Insurance Transaction Form (PS-404).  Completed documents are to be returned to Human Resources along with two items to proof of financial interdependence and proof of six month residency.  The Affidavit of Financial Interdependence includes a list of acceptable proofs.</dl>

			
		<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>	b)	Effective Date of Coverage<BR>
<BR>


					For applications received after March 1, 1995, the date of coverage will be six months after the latest date on the documents of proof that are submitted with the application.</dl>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>			c)	Dental and Vision Coverage<BR>
<BR>


					If an employee enrolls a domestic partner for health insurance and is eligible for the State administered dental and vision programs, the partner will automatically be eligible for dental and vision coverage.  If the employee receives prescription drug, dental and vision benefits from the CSEA Employee Benefit Fund or the UUP Benefit Trust Fund, the partner will also be eligible for those benefits based on the same eligibility criteria and application process used for health insurance enrollment.  The Funds will take the necessary action to provide applicable fund benefits to the partner.  They will contact the enrollee for any additional information they may need to complete enrollment of the partner for Fund-provided benefits.</dl>

		<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>	d)	Imputed Income<BR>
<BR>


					Covering a Domestic partner will almost always result in additional taxable income.  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules require the fair market value of the coverage provided to the domestic partner to be considered imputed income to the employee.  This means that the amount of taxable income reported on the employee's W-2 form will be increased by the fair market value of that coverage.  The fair market value of State-administered benefits equals the "gross" (before application of interest and dividend) individual premium less the employee's contribution for dependent coverage.  An employee who enrolls a domestic partner for health insurance and who has State-administered dental/vision benefits will also have the value of those benefits included as income.  This is required by the IRS because those benefits are automatically available to all eligible dependents.  There is no "opt-out", so the employee is in "constructive receipt" of State-administered dental/vision benefits for the partner as soon as (s)he demonstrates the partner's eligibility for coverage.

					For example, if the employee is an M/C employee, the imputed income for each pay period for 1995 will be approximately $74.40 (gross bi-weekly cost of health, dental and vision coverage, less premium paid by employee).  This means that if an M/C employee covers a domestic partner for 20 pay periods in 1995, (s)he will have to pay taxes on an additional $1,488.00 of income reported on his/her W-2.  This figure includes the value of health (including prescription drug benefits), dental and vision coverage.  Paycheck deductions for income tax and FICA contributions will also be adjusted to reflect this higher income level.</dl>

			<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt></dl>e)	Imputed Income Exception<BR>
<BR>


					If a domestic partner qualifies as a dependent under IRS Code Section 152 (copy enclosed with application package), there is no imputed income for the employee and none will be reported to the IRS if the dependent tax affidavit in the enrollment package is submitted by the employee at the time of application.  Employees will be required to review the IRS dependent status of the partner annually.  Mid-year adjustments will not be made to imputed income, payroll tax withholding and FICA contributions based on gain or loss of IRS dependent status.  If the partner's IRS dependent status changes mid-year, the employee will be responsible for reporting and paying taxes on the value of coverage provided to the partner for the entire year with that year's income tax return.<dl>

			<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt></blockquote></dl>f)	Pre/Post-Tax Deductions<BR>
<BR>


					IRS rules mandate that an employee who enrolls a domestic partner must pay the additional employee contribution for dependent coverage on a post-tax basis although the individual premium can remain pre-tax.  The Office of the State Comptroller will shortly be able to split health insurance deductions into pre- and post-tax components.  Employees who currently have pre-tax individual coverage, will have a post-tax deduction for the additional premium for dependent coverage.  Employees who already have family coverage on a pre-tax basis, will have their deductions split into pre-and post-tax components to meet IRS requirements.</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><blockquote>g)	Terminating Domestic Partner Coverage<BR>
<BR>


					When a domestic partner relationship ends, the employee must fill out and sign the Termination of Domestic Partnership Form within 14 days of the termination.  This form is part of the enrollment package.  The employee will not be eligible to enroll another domestic partner or re-enroll the same partner until six months after the Termination of Domestic Partnership Form is submitted to the Office of Human Resources.</dl>

		<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>	h)	Other Information<BR>
<BR>


					Eligibility for coverage of children of domestic partners will continue to be based on the New York State Health Insurance Program's eligibility criteria for "other children."  Note that these criteria assess the child's dependent status with respect to the enrollee and should be separate from the eligibility of the domestic partner.

					Domestic partners who survive a deceased employee will be eligible for dependent survivor coverage under the same circumstances as surviving spouses.

					Domestic partners who lose coverage eligibility will have 60 days following their loss of coverage in which to elect COBRA continuation.  The 60 day application period begins on the day eligibility is lost, not the day the termination form is filed, so termination notices must be filed promptly.

					Retirees may enroll domestic partners and must contact the New York State Department of Civil Services' Employee Benefits Division Program Service Unit directly to apply<BR>
<BR>
</dl>

<dt><A NAME="5A12"><i>12</A>.	COVERAGE WHILE ON LEAVE OF ABSENCE WITHOUT PAY</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>If an employee is granted a leave of absence without pay, or otherwise leaves the State payroll temporarily, he/she may be eligible to continue health insurance coverage while off the payroll. In order to do so, the employee must pay both the employee and employer shares of the premium.  The NYS Department of Civil Service Division of Employee Benefits will notify the employee as to the cost of the bi-weekly payment and due date of the first payment.  Failure to make payments on time will cause a cancellation of health insurance coverage.  Conversion privileges will not be offered.  In order to reinstate coverage while on leave, there will be a break in coverage and the enrollee will be subject to late enrollment provisions.
<dt><br>
<dt>If an employee is on leave-without-pay for 28 days or less and has not canceled his/her coverage, the employee and employer shares of the health insurance premium for that period will be automatically deducted from his/her paycheck once he/she has returned to work.
<dt><br>
<dt>If an employee does not want to continue health insurance coverage while off the payroll, coverage must be canceled prior to the last day on the payroll.  All employees should contact the Office of Human Resources concerning their insurance coverage while on leave prior to the beginning of a leave of absence without pay in order to complete the necessary paperwork and review the available options.	

</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5A13"><i>13</A>.	LOSS OF ELIGIBILITY - CONTINUATION OF COVERAGE THROUGH COBRA AND CONVERSION PRIVILEGES</i>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>a)	Continuation Of Coverage - Managerial/Confidential Employees (M/C) and Academic and Professional Employees (UUP)
<dt><br>
<dt>The Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliations Act (COBRA) provides for a temporary extension of health care coverage under the New York State Health Insurance Plan to an employee and covered dependents who are otherwise no longer eligible to continue this benefit.  COBRA provisions are available to Managerial/Confidential employees and employees represented by UUP.

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>i)	Eligibility

<dt><br>
<dd>(a) Employees and dependents who lose coverage because     the employee has been terminated for any reason     (other than gross misconduct), or has a reduction in     hours of employment whereby coverage would     terminate.
<dt><br>
    <dd>If an employee is terminated for gross misconduct,     he/she may be able to continue coverage under the     NYS Continuation of Coverage Law.

<dt><br>
<dd>(b) The spouse and dependent children of an active     employee has the right to continue coverage under     COBRA for any of the following reasons:
<dt><br>
<dd>1. the death of the employee,<br>
				    <dd>2. the divorce or legal separation of the employee<br>
				    <dd>3. the dependent child of the employee no longer meets the eligibility requirements

</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>ii)	Length of Coverage
<dt><br>
<dd>(a) Continuation of coverage for an employee's spouse and/or dependent children may be continued for up to 3 years unless coverage was lost due to termination of employment or a reduction of work hours.  If this is the case, the required continuation coverage period is 18 months. 
<dt><br>
				<dd>(b) Continued coverage through COBRA will cease for any person if:
<dt><br>
				   <dd>(1) New York State no longer provides group             health care coverage to any of its employees, or the union Employee Benefit             Fund no longer provides the type of coverage to State employees;
<dt><br>
				 <dd>(2) the premium for continued coverage is not paid on time;
<dt><br>
				  <dd>(3) the person becomes eligible for Medicare;
<dt><br>
				  <dd>(4) the person becomes covered under another health care plan; or
<dt><br>
				  <dd>(5) the continuation period ends.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>iii)	Available Benefits
<dt><br>
				<dt>All Medical, Hospital, Drug, Dental, Vision, and Hearing Care insurance coverages available as an active employee (or the dependent of an active employee) are available under COBRA.  Employees represented by UUP are also eligible to continue benefits provided by the UUP Benefit Trust Fund through COBRA.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>iv)	Cost of Continued Coverage
<dt><br>
				<dt>Any person who elects to continue coverage under the Plan must pay the gross premium (employee cost plus employer cost) plus a two percent (2%) administrative fee.  Payments for continued coverage must be made in advance on the first day of each month for which coverage will be provided.  Employees represented by UUP must also make payment directly to the UUP Benefit Trust Fund to continue dental, vision and prescription benefits.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>v)	Notices
<dt><br>
				<dt>The Division of Employee Benefits will notify eligible enrollees of their continuation rights.  Eligible enrollees and dependents have sixty (60) days from the date the coverage ends or the date of the notice, whichever is later, to elect coverage and submit one month's payment.  However, the employee or covered spouse or covered dependent child must notify the Division of Employee Benefits in writing in the event of a divorce, legal separation, or when the dependent child no longer qualifies as a covered dependent under the plan.  *The written notification must be made within sixty (60) days of such event to qualify the dependent for continuation of coverage.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>vi)	When COBRA Will Not Be Offered
<dt><br>
				<dt>COBRA coverage will not be offered when an employee/dependent is able to continue coverage in the State Health Insurance Plan.  Examples of this would be when an employee dies and a dependent continues coverage as a dependent survivor or when the employment terminates and the employee continues coverage in vested status.
</dl>
		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>b)	Continuation of Coverage - Direct-Pay Conversion Contracts 
<dt><br>
			<dt>Under certain conditions, New York State Health Insurance Plan (NYSHIP) enrollees and their dependents are entitled to direct- pay conversion contracts after NYSHIP coverage ends or after continuation of coverage in NYSHIP under COBRA ends.  The benefit package and the premium costs for direct-pay conversion contracts may differ from those under NYSHIP.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>c)	Conversion Privileges
<dt><br>
			<dt>An employee will be given the opportunity to convert to direct-pay conversion contract(s) with the carrier(s) of their former coverage, if the enrollee and eligible dependents lose eligibility to continue coverage under NYSHIP for any of the following reasons:
<dt><br>
			<dd>1.	Termination of employment,<br>
			<dd>2.	Resignation,<br>
			<dd>3.	Loss of status as an eligible employee or dependent,<br>
			<dd>4.	Death of the employee or retiree (when the dependent is not eligible for a survivor coverage) or <br>
			<dd>5.	COBRA continuation period ends.
<dt><br>
			<dd>* In order to enroll in a Direct-Pay Conversion Plan, application must be made within 45 days from the date coverage terminates.
<dt><br>
<dt>Direct-pay conversion contracts are not available to:
<dt><br>
			<dd>1.	enrollees who voluntarily cancel their coverage;<br>
			<dd>2.	enrollees who fail to remit required payments during periods of temporary removal from the payroll or enrollees who fail to remit the required cost for coverage continuation under COBRA; or<br>
			<dd>3.	vestees who have failed to remit payments
<dt><br>
			<dd>* There is no conversion right under the Metropolitan Life Insurance Plan for Empire Plan enrollees who have existing coverage which would duplicate the conversion coverage or who are eligible for Medicare.
<dt><br>
<dt>Once continued coverage ends for any person, that person may obtain a personal health care (conversion) policy without evidence of insurability, as provided under the terms of the Plan.  Such a conversion right is not available for prescription drug coverage. Contact the Office of Human Resources for Conversion Policy addresses and telephone numbers. 
</dl>
	</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5A14"><i>14</A>.	TERMINATION OF COVERAGE</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>When the employee loses eligibility to continue coverage, the health insurance plan terminates twenty-eight (28) days after the last day  of the payroll period from which the employee is separated.

<CENTER><B>APPENDIX XIX<BR>
POLICY ON CONFLICT OF INTEREST</B></CENTER>
<dt><br>
I.     INTRODUCTION
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 0 -->
<dt>Consistent with the mission of the State University of New York, all faculty and staff are encouraged to pursue free and open inquiry and the unrestricted dissemination of knowledge.  Open exchange of scholarly knowledge is integral to SUNY's goals of instruction, research and scholarship, and public service.  Moreover, as members of a public university, the faculty and staff of SUNY have a responsibility to ensure integrity in all aspects of the performance of their assignments.
<dt><br>
<dt>This policy represents a restatement of existing University policy and pertinent State and Federal law and regulations including:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
<dt>Policies of the Board of Trustees, Article XI, Title H, Section 4; New York State Public Officers Law, Section 73-a, and 73 and 74; 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 50, Subpart F; and National Science Foundation, Grant Policy Manual (GPM), Section 310
</dl>
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dt>II.     DEFINITION
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 0 -->
<dt>--  A conflict of interest is any interest, financial or otherwise, direct or indirect; participation in any business, transaction or professional activity; or incurring of any obligation of any nature, which is or appears to be in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of an employee's duties in the public interest.  A conflict of interest is also any financial interest that will, or may be reasonably expected to, bias the design, conduct or reporting of sponsored research.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dt>III.     POLICY
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
<dt>Faculty and staff of the University are encouraged to foster an atmosphere of academic freedom by promoting the open and timely exchange of scholarly knowledge independent of personal interests.  In keeping with this obligation, they are also required to avoid conflicts of interest.  In instances where potential or actual conflicts exist, faculty and staff are expected to consult with appropriate University officials implementing this policy to identify potential or actual conflicts of interest and take appropriate steps to manage, reduce or eliminate them.
<dt><br>
<dt>1.  SUNY faculty and staff may not engage in other employment which interferes with the performance of their professional obligation (Policies of the Board of Trustees Article XI, Title H, Section 4).
<dt><br>
<dt>2.  SUNY faculty and staff are expected to comply with the New York State Public Officers Law provisions on conflict of interest and ethical conduct (Sections 73 and 74).
<dt><br>
<dt>3.  SUNY faculty and staff, to the extent required by law or regulation, shall disclose at minimum whether they (and their spouses and dependent children) have employment or financial interests or hold significant offices, in external organizations that may affect, or appear to affect, the discharge of professional obligations to the University (as required and subject to the limits of NYS Public Officer Law 73-a, and 73, 74; 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart F; and, NSF, GPM, Section 310).
<dt><br>
<dt>4.  SUNY campuses shall ensure that all faculty and staff subject to pertinent laws and regulations disclose financial interests in accordance with procedures to be established by the Chancellor or designee.  Campuses shall retain the reported information as required, identify actual or apparent conflicts of interest and seek resolution of such conflicts.
<dt><br>
<dt>5.  Each campus President shall submit to the System Provost the name and title of the person or persons designated as financial disclosure designee(s) and shall further notify the Provost when a change in that assignment occurs.  The Provost shall also be notified of any reports regarding Conflict of Interest that are forwarded to State or Federal agencies.

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>2<A NAME="12A29">9.  HAZARD COMMUNICAT</A>ION STANDARD</I><BR>
<BR>
The purpose of the New York State Right To Know Law and the Federal Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) is to ensure that workers are informed about all toxic substances produced or used in the workplace and how to protect themselves from physical and health hazards.  The rights afforded to employees by the State and Federal laws include the following:<BR>
1.  The right to notice and information regarding all hazardous chemicals present on the work site.<BR>
2.  The right to refuse to work with a substance if a request for information regarding that substance has not received a response.<BR>
3.  The right to review employee exposure records maintained by SUNY.<BR>
4.  The right to training.<BR>
5.  The right to recourse through the New York State Attorney General or the Department of Labor in the event an employee's rights have been violated.<BR>
<BR>
The Hazard Communications Standard requires manufacturers and suppliers to provide a material safety data sheet (MSDS) for each chemical that is distributed.  Employers are required to mintain a MSDS for each hazardous chemical present on the job site.  The MSDS will provide all safety handling and hazard information for that particular substance.<BR>
<BR>
The MSDS is an integral part of the Right To Know Program.  You should refer to it before handling any chemical and whenever the need arises.<BR>
<BR>
The Hazard Communication Standard calls for the development of a system of labeling for containers of hazardous materials.  Each label must contain the following:  the name of the chemical, the name and address of the manufacturer, and an appropriate hazard warning.<BR>

	<dt><A NAME="12A18e">e</A>)	Reproduction By Libraries And Archives:  Limitations On  Exclusive Rights
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
<dt>i)	Limitations on exclusive use have been provided for Libraries and Archives.  A library may reproduce one copy if (a) the reproduction or distribution is made without commercial advantage; (b) the collections are open to public or outside researchers; (c) the
reproduction includes a notice of copyright.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->

</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
			<dt>iii)	Reproduction of a published work may be made only to replace a damaged, deteriorating, lost or stolen copy if the library after a reasonable effort cannot get an unused replacement copy at a fair price.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
			<dt>iv)	A library may reproduce a copy of one article of a periodical for a user on request if the copy becomes the property of the user and the library has no notice that it would be used for any purposes other than study, scholarship or research if a warning of copyright is displayed.

<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
			<dt>v)	Reproduction of an entire work or substantial part thereof may be made from the collection if the library by reasonable investigation determines that it cannot be obtained at a reasonable price and the copy become the copy of the user and the library has no notice of use other than private study, scholarship or research and a warning of copyright is displayed.

They may be used once by individual teachers in the course of relevant teaching activities and repeated once for instructional reinforcement during the first ten instructional days within the forty-five day retention period.  They can be recorded only once at  request of a teacher and a limited number of copies may be made to meet needs within the retention period of several requesting teachers.  After ten instructional days within retention period the tape may only be used for teacher evaluation.  Parts of broadcasts may be used but cannot be altered and the educational institution is expected to maintain controls to ensure the integrity of use to conform with these guidelines.

<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
	<dt><A NAME="12A18g">g</A>)	Applying For Permission To Reproduce Copyrighted Materials
<dt><br>
			<dt>In most cases, a letter to the copyright holder (usually addressed to the permissions department of the work's publisher) is needed in order to secure permission to reproduce copyrighted materials that do not fall under the guidelines for reproduction stated above.
<dt><br>
<dt>The Association of American Publishers has issued these recommendations for faculty members requesting permission to reproduce copyrighted materials:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
<dt>i)	Request all permissions for a specific project at the same time.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>ii)	Do not ask for a blanket permission for all of the material.  It complicates the request.  Often it cannot be granted.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
			<dt>iii)	Send a photocopy of the copyright page and the pages for which permission is being requested along with your application.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
			<dt>iv)	Be sure to enclose a return address with your request.
</dl><!-- 2 -->
<dt><br>
			<dt>Publishers receive these requests every day.  Provided the requests are presented in proper order, they usually grant them quickly and efficiently.

		<dt><A NAME="12A32a">a</A>)	Frederick W. Crumb Memorial Library
 <dt><br>
			<dt>Students and faculty of SUNY Potsdam and the three other colleges in Potsdam and Canton, as well as the community at large, may borrow library materials and use  the services offered by the Crumb Library.  Students enrolled at any SUNY campus have library privileges throughout SUNY.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Library materials borrowed by students and community residents are due 28 days following the day that they are signed out or at the end of the semester, whichever comes first.  SUNY Potsdam faculty loans are due 120 days following the day that they are signed out.  For all borrowers, maps and videos are due 2 days after they are signed out.  All periodicals are library use only.
               <dt><br>
			<dt>Any library material may be recalled before the due date at the request of another borrower.  Failure to respond to a recall notice will result in a fine of five dollars plus one dollar for each additional day up to a maximum recall fine of fifty dollars per item.  
<dt><br>
			<dt>The overdue fine is $1.00 per day per item to a maximum of $50.00 per item.  There is a grace period of 14 days, during which there is no fine for material that is returned or renewed.  The fine that applies after the grace period expires is retroactive to the first day material is overdue.
               <dt><br>
			<dt>In addition, failure to respond to a recall or to return overdue material will result in a suspension of borrowing privileges.  In addition, SUNY Potsdam students who have not cleared their library records will be unable to register again and their transcripts will be withheld.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Library materials may be renewed in person or by phone (267-2485) unless a recall request is pending.

		<dt><A NAME="12A32b">b</A>)	Crane Library
<dt><br>
			<dt>Students, faculty and staff of SUNY Potsdam and the three other colleges in Potsdam and Canton, as well as the community at large and students at other SUNY campuses, may borrow library materials and use the services offered by the Crane Library.
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	Circulating Material
<dt><br>
				<dt>There are two categories of circulating materials in Crane Library.  The majority of these materials circulate for the same period of time as do materials from Crumb Library.  A second category of materials circulate for a limited time period.<br><BR>
<dt><B>Regular Circulating Materials</B>
<BR>
<dt>These include most books and scores, and the policies are similar to those established by Crumb Library.  Library materials borrowed by students and community residents are due 28 days following the day that they are signed out or at the end of the semester, whichever comes first.  SUNY Potsdam faculty loans are due 120 days following the day that they are first signed out.  All periodicals are library use only.
<BR>
<BR>

<dt>Any library material may be recalled before the due date at the request of another borrower.  Failure to respond to a recall notice will result in a fine of five dollars plus one dollar for each additional day up to a maximum recall fine of fifty dollars per item. 
<br><BR>
<dt>The overdue fine is $1.00 per day per item to a maximum of $50.00 per item.  There is a grace period of 14 days, during which there is no fine for material that is returned or renewed.  The fine that applies after the grace period expires is retroactive to the first day material is overdue.<BR>
<BR>
<dt>In addition, failure to respond to a recall or to return overdue material will result in a suspension of borrowing privileges.  Furthermore, SUNY Potsdam students who have not cleared their library records will be unable to register again and their transcripts will be withheld.<BR>
<BR>
<dt>Library materials may be renewed in person or by phone (267-2451) unless a recall request is pending.<BR>
<BR>

<dt><B>Materials Circulating For a Limited Time Period</B>
<BR>
<dt>These include historical sets of music and complete works of composers (scored classified in M2 and M3).  Materials in these categories borrowed by students and community residents must be returned by closing on the day they are borrowed.  Materials borrowed by faculty are due 5 days after they are first signed out.<BR>
<BR>
<dt>Procedures concerning recalls, overdues, and renewals are similar to those established for regular circulating materials.<BR>
<BR>

			<dt>ii)	Non-circulating Material
<dt><br>
				<dt>Non-circulating materials include records, compact discs, cassette and open-reel tapes, video recordings,
periodicals, reserve materials, restricted materials,
reference books, and graduate theses. Faculty may make special arrangements to borrow these materials for instructional or research purposes.
<dt><br>

<dt>A fine of five dollars plus one dollar per each additional day up to a maximum of $50.00 per item will be levied for failure to respond to a recall notice.
<dt><br>

<dt>Overdue notices are sent if materials are not returned by their due dates.  Failure to respond to a recall or to return overdue material will result in a suspension of borrowing privileges.
<dt><br>
<dt>Materials may be renewed in person or by phone (267-2451) unless a recall request is pending.

<dt><br>
		<dt>With respect to public assemblies, SUNY Potsdam will observe and implement the SUNY Board of Trustees' policy entitled "Rules and Regulations for Maintenance of Public Order on Premises of State-Operated Institutions of the State University of New York."  Copies of this document are on file in the Crumb Library and are available from the Office of the Assistant Vice President for Student Development, 105 Barrington Student Union.

<dt><br>
<dt>If it is a job which requires simple duplicating, the timeliness of delivery and the quantity required will affect the decision as to where the job is printed.  This decision is to be made by the Duplicating staff.
</dl><!-- 3 -->
</dl><!--2 -->
	<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt><A NAME="12A40e">e</A>) Publication Requests
<dt><br>
<Dt>To initiate an external publication to be produced by the Office of College Relations, you must file a Publication Request Form.  This form provides the basic information necessary to begin production planning.  It will also allow for prioritizing the publication in order to schedule the annual workload.
<dt><br>
<dt>Publication Request Forms are sent to all departments in April.  At this time, you are asked to project your publications needs for the following year (July 1 - June 30).
<dt><br>
<dt>If for some reason, the office is unable to handle your request, the staff will suggest alternative methods for having the publication produced.
<dt><br>
<dt>Of course, there are always unanticipated needs; the office will try to accommodate these needs on a time-available basis.  Publication Request Forms for these unscheduled publications are available throughout the year in the Office of College Relations.  You should file one as soon as you know your need.

		</dl><!--2 -->
	<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt><A NAME="12A40f">f</A>)	Funding For Publication
<dt><br>
			<dt>The Publications budget in the Office of College Relations provides for only the major recruitment and development publications of the College.  All other publications are funded through the originating departments.  Please be sure to include the amount you have budgeted for your publication and the account number to which it will be charged when you complete the Printing Publication Request Form.

		</dl><!--2 -->
	<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt><A NAME="12A40g">g</A>)	Recruiting Publications (Admissions)
<dt><br>
			<dt>All publications intended to be used for admissions recruiting must first be reviewed and approved by the Director of Admissions and the Director of College Relations.

		<dt><A NAME="12A40h">h</A>)	Production Services
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	Planning and Advising
<dt><br>
				<dt>The staff of the Office of College Relations is involved in planning printing on a daily basis.  Consulting with the office as soon as you know that you will be producing a publication will save you time, energy and money.
<dt><br>
			<dt>ii)	Time and Cost Estimates
<dt><br>
				<dt>The staff will evaluate your proposed publication, determine the printing option that best suits your needs, and provide time and cost estimates. 
<dt><br>
			<dt>iii)	Editing
<dt><br>
				<dt>The staff provides editorial support.  However, you are responsible for preparing original copy.  Guidelines for the preparation of copy are available in the Office of College Relations.  Following these guidelines will expedite the production of your publication.
<dt><br>
			<dt>iv)	Typesetting
<dt><br>
				<dt>Computerized typesetting for most publications is done in-house.  Copy submitted for publication should be on disk in Microsoft Word or Word Star with an attached hard copy.  
<dt><br>
			<dt>v)	Proofreading
<dt><br>
<dt>While due caution is exercised in typesetting, typographical errors do occur.  Ultimately, it is the client's responsibility to ensure that the typeset matter is free from errors.  You will be asked to proofread your copy and to sign off on corrections throughout the production process. 
<dt><br>
			<dt><br>vi)	Design
<dt><br>
				<dt>Do not try to design your publication in advance.  Experienced graphic designers will design a publication that will effectively communicate the intended message while maintaining the College's publication standards.
<dt><br>
			<dt>viii)	Expediting
<dt><br>
				<dt>If your publication is to be printed in Duplicating, it is your responsibility to see that the Duplicating Job Request is properly filled out and that the job is taken to Duplicating.  If the job is to be printed at the Central Print Shop (SUNY Canton), the designer assigned to the job will fill out the Duplicating Job Request and expedite production.  If the job is to be printed by an outside vendor, your designer will coordinate (through Purchasing) production of the publication.

			<dt>i)	Bidding
<dt><br>
				<dt>All printing purchased from outside vendors is closely regulated by statute and monitored by the Office of General Services and the Office of the State Comptroller.  Most of the printing performed by outside vendors requires competitive bidding.  Printing orders in excess of $2,500 require sealed bids.  The bidding process can take from thirty to sixty days, depending on the estimated dollar amount of the order.

 <center><strong>V. HEALTH, DEPENDENT CARE AND MEDICAL RELATED BENEFITS</center></strong>
<BR>
<BR>
<dt><A NAME="5B"><b>B</A>.	MEDICARE </b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA) requires the New York State Health Insurance Program to provide primary coverage for active employees under age 65 or their dependents under age 65 who are enrolled in Medicare due to a disability.  Medicare then becomes the secondary insurance carrier.
<dt><br>
<dt>An individual who reaches age 65 and meets Medicare requirements  must apply for Medicare coverage parts A & B, at a local Social Security Office, in order to receive full health insurance benefits.  To avoid the loss of Medicare benefits, the individual should enroll him/herself and dependents during the three month period preceding his or her 65th birthdate.  Detailed information is available at the local Social Security Office.
<dt><br>
<dt>For active employees age 65 and over who are enrolled in Medicare, the Empire Plan remains the primary insurance carrier and Medicare is the secondary carrier until the employee retires.
<dt><br>
<dt>When an employee becomes eligible for Medicare it is strongly advised that enrollment in Medicare Parts A & B be effected.

<dt><A NAME="5C"><b>C</A>.	PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAMS</b>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5C1"><i>1</A>.	PROGRAM FOR MANAGERIAL/CONFIDENTIAL EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEES REPRESENTED BY COUNCIL 82</b>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The Empire Health Insurance Plan has an associated co-pay prescription drug program through the State of New York (Value Rx) for eligible managerial/confidential employees that allows employees, dependents, and domestic partners to purchase prescription drugs from participating pharmacies at minimal cost.
<dt><br>
<dt>An employee obtaining prescription drugs from a participating pharmacy is responsible for the co-pay charge.  If such drugs are obtained from a non-participating pharmacy the employee must pay the full cost of the prescription.  Upon filing a claim form with the receipt of purchase the employee will be reimbursed, in general, an amount based upon standard prescription drug pricing guides minus the co-pay charge.  The difference between the non-participating pharmacy's charge and the amount reimbursed, in most cases, will be greater than the co-pay charge.  It is therefore to the employee's advantage to use a participating pharmacy.  The plan also has a Mandatory Generic Substitution Requirement.
<dt><br>
<dt>Eligibility, effective date of coverage, dependent eligibility, domestic partner eligibility, continuation in retirement, coverage while on leave of absence  without pay, loss of eligibility and termination of coverage is identical to the health insurance plan rules and regulations. 

	</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5C2"><i>2</A>.	PROGRAM FOR ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES (UUP)</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Employees under the Professional Services Negotiating Unit who are eligible for enrollment in the Empire Health Insurance Plan have an associated co-pay prescription drug program through the UUP Benefit Trust Fund that allows employees and dependents to purchase prescription drugs from participating pharmacies with an associated co-payment.  The plan also has a Mandatory Generic Substitution Requirement.
<dt><br>
<dt>An employee obtaining prescription drugs from a participating pharmacy is responsible for the co-pay charge.  If such drugs are obtained from a non-participating pharmacy (or you do not have an ID card), the employee must pay the full cost and be reimbursed an amount no greater than the amount which would be paid to a participating pharmacy upon submission of a completed direct pay claim form.
<dt><br>
<dt>The effective date of coverage, dependent eligibility (except a legally separated spouse is not covered), domestic partner eligiblity, continuation in retirement, coverage while on leave of absence without pay and loss of eligibility is identical to the health insurance plan rules and regulations.
<dt><br>
<dt>Eligibility for benefits will terminate at the end of the           month following the month in which the employee last appears           on the payroll as an active state employee.

<dt><A NAME="5D"><b>D</A>.	HOME CARE ADVOCACY PROGRAM (HCAP)</b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>The Empire Plan's Home Care Advocacy Program (HCAP) started October 1, 1994.  HCAP is administered by Metropolitan.  When you call HCAP at 1-800-638-9918 and use an HCAP provider for medically necessary home care services and/or durable medical equipment/supplies prescribed by your doctor, you have a paid-in-full benefit for:
<dt><br>
	<dd>(a)	durable medical equipment/supplies
<dt><br>
	<dd>(b)	home nursing
<dt><br>
	<dd>(c)	home infusion therapy
<dt><br>
	<dd>(d)	certain home health care services when they take the place of hospitalization or care in a skilled nursing facility; home health aides; physical, occupational and speech therapy; prescription drugs; laboratory services.
<dt><br>
<dt>Call HCAP as soon as your doctor prescribes home care services and/or durable medical equipment/supplies.  Metropolitan will pre-certify medical necessity and then make or help you make the arrangements.  They will work with participating providers in your area.  If there are none, they will arrange for you to receive the pre-certified home care and/or equipment/supplies from a non-participating provider.
<dt><br>
<dt>After you call HCAP and your home care services and/or durable medical equipment/supplies are pre-certified as medically necessary, you may choose a non-participating provider that HCAP has not approved.  You will have out-of-pocket expenses.  The Empire Plan Basic Medical benefits will apply.  You must pay for the first 48 hours of private duty nursing per calendar year and meet your annual deductible.  You must submit a claim to Metropolitan.  You will be reimbursed 80% of the reasonable and customary charge for covered services.  You are responsible for the remaining 20% (until you meet your coinsurance maximum) and any charges above the reasonable and customary charge.

<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E1a">a</A>)	The Plan
<dt><br>
			<dt>New York State provides M/C employees with a group dental insurance plan, the Preferred Dental Plan, administered by Group Health Incorporated.  The entire cost of the coverage is paid by the State for eligible employees and dependents.  The plan covers a broad range of dental work.  If an employee chooses to use a participating dentist, all covered fees are paid by the plan.  If the employee chooses to use a non-participating dentist, reimbursement is made in accordance with a fee schedule based on a Statewide average.  The employee is responsible for any difference between the dentists' fees and the plan's payment schedule.  Coverage under this plan is automatic and is subject to certain deductibles.

<dt><br>
			<dt>Coverage under this Plan is effective on the first day of the month after an employee has completed six full calendar months of continuous employment.  The employee may have satisfied the six month period of employment in a non-eligible position.  In this event, the effective date is the first day of the month following the date of transfer to an eligible position.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E1d">d</A>)	The Deductible
<dt><br>
			<dt>There is an annual deductible, for all services except Preventative Care, Diagnostic Care and Orthodontics.  The deductible is $25.00 per person per calendar year.  The total family deductible will not exceed $75.00 per year for all covered family members.  The amount of the deductible is based on GHI's schedule, not on the amount charged by the dentist.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E1e">e</A>)	Expiration of Coverage and Leave Without Pay Status
<dt><br>
			<dt>Coverage in the Plan ends the last day of the month in which an employee is separated from active service with  his/her employer or is transferred from a unit or group eligible to participate in the Program.  In the event of death, your dependents' coverage terminates on the last day of the month in which your death occurs.  
<dt><br>
<dt>If you are placed in leave without pay status you may continue your coverage.  Payments of the full cost of coverage for this period must be made directly to the Office of Human Resources.
<dt><br>
<dt>If you do not make these payments, your coverage will cease on the last day of the month in which you were placed on leave without pay.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E1f">f</A>)	Cost
<dt><br>
			<dt>If you are employed by the State of New York, the State will pay the full cost of coverage for you and your eligible dependents. 
<dt><br>
<dt>If you are temporarily removed from the payroll, you may continue coverage while off the payroll by paying the full cost yourself.  Details are available from the Office Human Resources.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E1g">g</A>)	If You Leave State Service
<dt><br>
			<dt>If you leave State service, you may be eligible to continue your coverage through COBRA.  You must request continuation of coverage in writing within 60 days of the later of (1) the date coverage would otherwise end or (2) the date notice of your right to continue coverage is sent to you. (Please refer to the book "Preferred Dental Plan for You and Your Dependents" for more information.)
<dt><br>
			<dt>If you choose to continue your coverage through COBRA, NYS is required to offer you coverage which, as of the time coverage is being provided, is identical to the coverage provided under the plan to similarly situated employees or family members.  The law requires that you have the opportunity to maintain continuation of coverage for 3 years, unless you lost your group health coverage because of termination of employment or reduction in hours.  In that case, the required continuation coverage period is 18 months.  The law also provides that your continuation coverage may be cut short for either of the following reasons:
<dt><br>
			<dd>(1)	if NYS no longer provides dental insurance coverage to 	its employees<br>
			<dd>(2)	if the premium for your coverage is not paid on time.
<dt><br>
			<dt>You will have to pay all of the premium for your continuation coverage plus a 2% administrative fee.  You will have an initial grace period of 45 days starting with the date you choose continuation coverage to pay any premium; after the  initial 45 day grace period, you will have a grace period of at least 30 days to pay subsequent premiums.  COBRA also requires that at the end of the 18 month, 29 month or 3 year period, you are eligible to convert to a direct pay dental conversion contract.  If you choose COBRA, you must exhaust those benefits before converting to a direct-pay conversion plan.  If you choose COBRA and fail to make the payments or cancel coverage, you will not be eligible to convert to an individual policy.  Please contact the Office of Human Resources for additional information on COBRA.

<dt><A NAME="5E2a">a</A>)	The Plan
<dt><br>
			<dt>The United University Professions (UUP) provides employees under the Professional Services Negotiating Unit a dental program administered by the UUP Benefit Trust Fund.  The schedule of allowances provides payments according to a schedule of covered dental procedures which relate directly to the dentist's actual charges.  There are no deductibles which means eligible enrollee's receive first dollar coverage for their dental work and the cost of coverage is paid by the Benefit Trust Fund.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E2b">b</A>)	Eligibility
<dt><br>
			<dt>An employee eligible for enrollment in the State Health Insurance Program is eligible for dental benefits.

<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E2c">c</A>)	Effective Date of Coverage
<dt><br>
			<dt>If you are a new employee in the PSNU, and you transferred directly from other State employment, you will become eligible for benefits on the day after the coverage under your previous plan terminates.  In all instances, you will not suffer a break in coverage.
<dt><br>
<dt>If you are a new employee in the PSNU, and you were not employed by the New York State Government immediately prior to your employment in the PSNU, you will become eligible for benefits following the completion of forty-two days of continuous service in covered employment.

<dt><A NAME="5E2d">d</A>)	Expiration of Coverage
<dt><br>
			<dt>Eligibility for benefits will terminate at the end of the month following the month in which you were last employed.
<dt><br>
<dt>However, if you are on authorized sick or disability leave without pay, your eligibility for benefits will terminate at the end of the fourth month following the month in which you were last employed.  A copy of your agency's sick or disability leave of absence without pay notice must be filed with the Fund Office before claims can be paid.  This will serve as certification of eligibility.
<dt><br>
<dt>Your enrolled dependents will lose eligibility at the same time that you do.
<dt><br>
<dt>You will again become eligible for benefits as soon as you have completed one full day of work, if you are re-employed within twelve months as an active employee in the PSNU and are eligible for State Health Insurance.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E2e">e</A>)	Continuity of Benefits
<dt><br>
			<dt>The dental benefits described above cease when you leave the UUP/PEBF group.  However, arrangements can be made to continue coverage on a Direct Payment basis or through COBRA for yourself or a dependent when he or she is no longer eligible.  The benefits provided will differ somewhat from Fund coverage.
<dt><br>
<dt>Upon request to the Fund, you will be furnished with the appropriate conversion applications and full instructions concerning continuation of dental coverage on a Direct Payment basis or through COBRA.
<dt><br>
<dt>Applications for continuation of coverage must be received within 30 days after your removal from the group.

<dt><br>
		<dt>Eligible M/C employees, their dependents, and their domestic partners are eligible for hearing care coverage under the M/C Hearing Care Plan.  The eligible enrollee must obtain medical clearance from an otolaryngologist prior to seeking any covered services.  The medical exam is required, but not covered under this plan. It may, however, be covered under the employee's health insurance plan.
<dt><br>
<dt>If recommended by the otolaryngologist, the employee next obtains an audiological evaluation (hearing test) from an audiologist.  The Plan reimburses up to $60 for this exam. If a hearing aid is recommended the employee proceeds to an audiologist for a hearing aid consultation to determine which aid is most suitable.  The Plan reimburses up to $70 for the consultation.
<dt><br>
<dt>The employee then purchases the aid or aids from an otolaryngologist, audiologist, or hearing aid dealer.  The plan provides up to $350 for one aid or $600 for two aids, if one aid is required for each ear.
<dt><br>
<dt>Plan benefits are available to each covered person once in each 45 month period and all covered expenses must be claimed on a single form.  The benefit enhancement for children under 12 years of age allows benefits to repeat after 24 months with prior written approval.

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<A NAME="5A"><b>A</A>.	HEALTH INSURANCE</b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>The College provides the opportunity to join one of two health insurance plans:  THE EMPIRE PLAN or The Mohawk Valley Health Maintenance Organization (MVP-HMO).

	<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5A1"><i>1</A>.	THE EMPIRE PLAN</i>

		<dt><br>
<dd></dl>
The Empire Plan offers hospitalization coverage provided through Blue Cross, and medical/surgical for Major Medical benefits provided through the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.
<dt><br>
		<dl>	The Empire Plan, although offering few preventive services, is designed to provide a comprehensive program of protection against most medical expenses, with an emphasis on insurance against the often catastrophic costs that result from major illness.  The plan also provides flexibility in the selection of participating providers (physicians) or other providers of services.  In recognition of the broad protection available, and to provide an incentive for the prudent utilization of benefits, the Empire Plan has both an annual deductible as well as a coinsurance feature for most charges covered under the major medical portion of the plan.  However, some hospital charges covered by Blue Cross are subject to a coinsurance payment for out-patient treatment.
</dl>
</dl>
<dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt><blockquote><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="5A2">2</A>.	THE MVP HEALTH PLAN (HMO)</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The MVP Health Plan is an innovative plan which combines the comprehensive benefits of an HMO with the ability to continue seeing local doctors in their private offices.  Participating physicians must be used except in exceptional cases.  There are no deductibles, no claim forms and no lifetime maximums.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Employees can pay their share of the health insurance premium on a pre-tax basis.  Contact the Office of Human Resources for details.

	</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>3.	<A NAME="5A3">ELIGIBILITY</A></i>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>a)	all employees with full-time appointments anticipated to last at least 12 weeks;
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>b)	part-time managerial/confidential (M/C) employees who are at least half-time or more, who have appointments that are anticipated to last at least twelve (12) weeks and who work on a regular schedule;

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>c)	part-time academic employees who teach two or more courses in any one semester (excluding casual employees);

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>d)	part-time professional employees if they are employed at a salary rate which would yield a total compensation of $9,000 or more per year, (excluding casual employees) are eligible to elect a plan.
</dl>
	</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5A4"><i>4</A>.	EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Coverage is effective on the 43rd day of employment if election is made before that date.  The cost of coverage is dependent upon whether individual or family coverage is elected.

	</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5A5"><i>5</A>.	PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTION PROGRAM</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>At the time an employee enrolls in a health insurance plan, he/she must also decide whether they would like to enroll in the Pre-Tax Contribution Program (PTCP).  Under the PTCP an employee may have their share of the health insurance bi-weekly premium deducted from their gross wages before taxes are withheld.  This program may lower taxes.  (Employees on Leave-Without-Pay making direct payments for health insurance are not eligible to participate in this program).  The amount of money saved in taxes will be dependent upon the employees' income, health insurance premium and the number of withholding allowances claimed on their taxes.
<dt><br>
		<dt>If an employee enrolls in the PTCP, the Internal Revenue Service places restrictions on changes that an employee can make to their health insurance.  Under the Internal Revenue Service rules, employees can change their pre-tax health insurance deduction if certain qualifying events exist or during the annual health insurance Option Transfer Period. (See the Office of Human Resources for more information on this plan.)

	</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5A6"><i>6</A>.	THE EMPIRE PLAN'S MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM</i>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>a)	The Plan
<dt><br>
			<dt>Effective February 1, 1992 (for employees represented by UUP and M/C employees and retirees), benefits for mental health and substance abuse became administered by American Psych Management (APM) and insured by Metropolitan Life.  APM changed it's name to Value Behavioral Health in March, 1994.
<dt><br>
			<dt>The program has two levels of benefits, Network and Non-Network. By calling Value Behavioral Health (VBH) and obtaining care for a mental health and/or substance abuse problem from a provider VBH recommends, the patient's out-of-pocket expense is significantly reduced.  Modest copayments are required for outpatient care and inpatient care is paid in full under the Network benefits.  There are no maximum benefit levels for medically necessary care.
</dl>
</dl>
</dl>
<dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt><blockquote><A NAME="5A7">7</A>.	 MANAGED PHYSICAL MEDICINE PROGRAM<br><BR>


		The Empire Plan's Managed Physical Medicine Program began August 1, 1995.  This program replaces current Metropolitan coverage for chiropractic treatment and physical therapy.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<blockquote>a)	Network Benefits
<dt><br>
	<dt>		There is an $8 copayment per visit when you use a network provider for chiropractic treatment or physical therapy.  The MPN provider will be responsible for certifying the medical necessity of care.  All certified services will be paid in full except for an $8 copayment.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>b)	How to find a Network Provider<BR>
<BR>
	

			The MPN network includes most current Empire Plan participating providers who provide chiropractic treatment or physical therapy.  It also includes many additional providers who meet MPN's high credentialing standards.<BR>
<BR>
Contact a provider directly and ask if the provider is in the MPN network, or call Metropolitan at 1-800-942-4640 and select the Managed Physical Medicine Program from the automated telephone system menu.  What if there are no MPN providers in the area?  Beginning August 1, 1995, you are guaranteed that network benefits will be available to you under the Managed Physical Medicine Program.<BR>
<BR>
Call Metropolitan at 1-800-942-4640.  MPN will make arrangements for you to receive medically necessary chiropractic treatment or physical therapy, and you will pay only your $8 copayment for each visit.<BR>
<BR>
But, you must call first and you must use the provider MPN recommends.  Remember, the Empire Plan covers only medically necessary treatment.<br>
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>c)	Non-Network Benefits (Deductible, Coinsurance, Annual Maximum Apply)<BR>
<BR>
If you receive chiropractic treatment or physical therapy from a non-network provider when MPN has not made arrangements for you, you will pay a much higher share of the cost.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><dl>1)	Deductible Applies<BR>
<BR>
You must meet the Managed Physical Medicine Program annual deductible of $250.  Your spouse/domestic partner must meet the $250 annual deductible, and all your enrolled children, combined, must meet the $250 annual deductible.  This deductible is separate from other Plan deductibles.<BR>
<BR>
</dl>
<dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>2)	Coinsurance and $1,500 Annual Maximum Apply<BR>
<BR>
After you meet your deductible, submit a claim to Metropolitan.  You will be reimbursed up to 50 percent of the network allowance for medically necessary services, subject to a maximum annual benefit of $1,500 per covered person.<BR>
<BR>
	Your out-of-pocket expenses under the Managed Physical Medicine Program do not count toward your  Basic Medical annual deductible and coinsurance maximum or toward your Mental Health and Substance Abuse deductibles.<BR>
<BR>	
If Metropolitan determines that the non-network care you received was not medically necessary, you will not receive any Empire Plan benefits, and you will be responsible for the full cost of care.</blockquote></dl>

</dl>
<dt>
<dd><dl><dt><A NAME="5A8"><i>8</A>.	THE DEPENDENT CARE ADVANTAGE ACCOUNT</i>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>a)	The Plan
<dt><br>
			<dt>This program is a New York State employee benefit that allows employees to pay for certain child care, elder care or disabled dependent care expenses on a pre-tax basis.  Employees may set aside up to $5,000 of pre-tax salary annually to be reimbursed for these costs.  These expenses must be incurred to allow you and your spouse, if married, to work.  Employees with dependent children under the age of 13, handicapped children of any age, or adult relatives needing care, may be interested in participating in this program.
<dt><br>
<dt>When an employee enrolls in the DCA Account, a regular pattern of the annual amount will be deducted from his/her bi-weekly paychecks throughout the year.  The deductions are made before State, Federal or Social Security taxes are calculated on an employee's gross pay, thereby reducing taxes and increasing spendable income.
<dt><br>
<dt>Due to the tax-advantage, there are several strict guidelines issued by the Internal Revenue Service.  One of them is the "use it or lose it rule".  This means that if an employee deposits pre-tax dollars into a reimbursement account and does not incur expenses equal to all of the money in the account, the employee will lose any remaining money in the account.  IRS guidelines will not permit any remaining dollars to be returned to the employee or carried over for the next year.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>b)	Eligibility
<dt><br>
			<dt>Any employee of the NYS Executive, Legislative, or Judicial Branches and Employees of Participating Employers who receive a regular bi-weekly paycheck as an employee of New York State is eligible to enroll in this program.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>c)	Enrollment
 <dt><br>    
			<dt>New employees are eligible to enroll in the DCA Account and must enroll within 30 days of their initial employment date.  Active employees and new employees who choose not to initially enroll in the program may do so during the Annual Open Enrollment Period, which occurs during the Fall of each year.
<dt><br>
<dt>For more information on this program, contact the Office of Human Resources.

<dt><br>
		<dt>A State retirement system which permits retirement at age 55 or thereafter.  Members who join after July 26, 1976 must complete ten years of creditable service after that date.  Credit is given only for time actually worked, i.e., faculty with an academic year obligation, even if paid on a 12-month basis, receive ten months of credited service.  Benefits are based on final average salary and years of full-time service.  A death benefit is provided as well as ordinary and accidental disability within minimum lengths of service.

<dt><br>
              <dt>If you have 10 or more years of service credit upon leaving public employment (including 5 years as a Retirement System member), you have the right to a vested benefit.  This will entitle you to a retirement allowance when you retire, related to your previous years of government employment.
<dt><br>

<dt><br>
              <dt>It is up to you to notify ERS when you become eligible for and ready to receive your benefit.  In order to receive your vested benefits at the earliest possible time, a retirement application must be completed and submitted before the first of the month following your 55th birthday.

<dt><br>
              <dt>Vested benefits are payable throughout your retirement and you can select an optional method of payment to provide for possible income to your beneficiary.

                   <dt>If you entered government service before age 40, your ordinary disability retirement benefit is 1/60th (1.66%) of your final average salary for each year of service credit.  Various factors (withdrawn contributions, periods out of service, and loans, among others) may reduce your benefits but, generally, the minimum allowance is one-third of your final average salary.

              <dt>You, the College, or anyone authorized by you, may file your application for disability benefits.  Application forms are available from the Retirement System or the Office of Human Resources.
<dt><br>
              <dt>If you think you are eligible, you may submit applications for both ordinary and accidental disability retirement benefits.  However, both must be submitted before your effective retirement date.
<dt><br>
              <dt>You are also eligible to select an option for the payment of  your disability benefits.  More information, is found in the Retirement System booklet entitled, "YOUR OPTIONS AT RETIREMENT."

<dt><A NAME="6C5ei">i</A>)   Ordinary Disability Benefits
<dt><br>
                   <dt>If you become physically or mentally disabled on a permanent basis, you may be eligible for an ordinary disability retirement benefit.  In order to qualify, you must have at least 10 years of service credit.
<dt><br>
                   <dt>If you entered government service before age 40, your ordinary disability retirement benefit is 1/60th (1.66%) of your final average salary for each year of service credit.  Various factors (withdrawn contributions, periods out of service, and loans, among others) may reduce your benefit but, generally, the minimum allowance is one-third of your final average salary.
<dt><br>
                   <dt>If you entered government service after attaining age 40, your benefit is equal to 1/60th (1.66%) of your final average salary multiplied by the number of years of possible service before you reach age 60.  Remember that your retirement allowance may be reduced, due to withdrawn contributions, loans, and other factors.  However, the minimum allowance is generally one-third of your final average salary.
<dt><br>
                   <dt>An application for this benefit may be submitted either while you are actually in the service upon which your  membership is based or while on a medical leave of absence.  Should you be separated from service, you must file your  application with the Retirement System within 90 days after termination of service.

             </dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6C5eii">ii</A>)   Accidental Disability Benefits
<dt><br>
                   <dt>Regardless of your time in service, if you become physically or mentally unable to perform your job as the direct result of an on-the-job accident which was not due to your willful negligence, you may be eligible for an accidental disability retirement benefit.
<dt><br>
                   <dt>In order to qualify, written notice of your accident must be filed with the Retirement System within 90 days of the accident, detailing the time and place of the incident, the particulars thereof, the nature and extent of your injuries, and your alleged incapacity.  The notice must be signed by you or someone acting on your behalf.  Your application for benefits must be filed before you reach age 60.  Should you be separated from service, either voluntarily or involuntarily, your application may be submitted within 2 years of your date of separation.
<dt><br>
                   <dt>If approved, your accidental disability retirement benefit will be a pension equal to:
<dt><br>
                    <dd>*   60% of the first $15,300 of your final average salary,
<dt><br>
                    <dd>*   50% of your final average salary over $15,300, and
<dt><br>
                    <dd>*   40% of any final average salary over $27,300.
<dt><br>
                   <dt>This benefit will be reduced by the total amount of  Workers' Compensation benefits that you are or may become entitled to receive.  Members who are eligible for Workers' Compensation must apply for these benefits.  In addition to your pension, you will receive an annuity provided by any contributions you may have made during your working years.

<dt><A NAME="6C5g">f</A>)  Contributions
<dt><br>
              <dt>As a Tier II member of the New Career Plan, you are not required to contribute towards your retirement benefits.  However, you may elect to make voluntary contributions to the Retirement System.  These contributions, plus interest, will provide additional annuity income for you when you retire.

          </dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6C5h">g</A>)  Loans
<dt><br>
              <dt>If you have made contributions towards your retirement benefits,  have at least one year of service credit, and are still on payroll, you may apply for a loan against your contributions.

<strong>XII.  CAMPUS POLICIES</strong><BR>

</center>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<A NAME="12A"><b>A</a>.	CAMPUS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</b>
<BR>
<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><dt><A NAME="12A53">53</A>.	<i>TEACHING LOADS</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>It is the responsibility of the Deans in consultation with the Provost and department chairs to develop instructional programs which will result in reasonably equal service to students, the College and the State University of New York from each member of the teaching faculty.  The policy of SUNY Potsdam on faculty utilization reflects the criteria of the Board of Trustees of the State University of New York for the evaluation of academic employees (Policies of the Board of Trustees, Article XII, Title A) and the practice which has been in effect for many years at the College.
<dt><br>
		<dt>While the primary responsibility of full-time faculty at SUNY Potsdam is academic instruction, other responsibilities include, but are not limited to, academic advising, research and/or creative activities, continuing professional development, and campus and community service.
<dt><br>
Full-time faculty at SUNY Potsdam normally carry 12 semester hours each semester.  These 12 semester hours are not limited to standard classroom teaching, but may include contact with students in credit-bearing lab sections, research seminars, and other learning modes.  Responsibilities are not determined on the basis of student load (i.e., a professor who teaches one or more large sections is not automatically given a course load reduction).  Low-enrolled courses (e.g., fewer than 12 students in a lower division course; fewer than 9 students in an upper division course) are reviewed by the dean for possible cancellation and substitution of a higher demand course.  Some faculty also teach tutorials and direct research projects for a few students.  Schedules are reviewed before and after pre-registration to assure the effective use of faculty resources while allowing the continuation of courses that are essential to major or other programs.
<dt><br>
<dt>Currently, variations on the normal expectations of teaching load are determined by the Deans, Provost, and in some cases, by the President.  Faculty may apply for a course reduction for research and other scholarly activity through the Department and the Department Chair to the Dean's office.  Such applications state the purpose of the reduction and carry with them the recommendation of the Department and the Department Chair.  Decisions on requested reductions are made by the Provost in consultation with the appropriate dean.
<dt><br>
<dt>In addition to the reduction granted for department chairs, a reduction in teaching assignment may be granted for such reasons as:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
			<dt>--	Administrative assignments (e.g., chair of the Faculty Assembly)<br>
			<dt>--	Research and other scholarly activity, as noted above,<br>
			<dt>--	Chair of a major search committee;<br>			<dt>--	Extraordinary community service.<br>
</dl><!-- 2 --><BR>

		<dt>All full-time faculty are expected to submit an annual report of their activities.  The reports are reviewed by the deans and, in the case of decisions regarding merit pay, reappointment, promotion and the granting of continuing appointment, by the Provost and the President.  Faculty are evaluated, promoted, and receive merit pay increments on the basis of teaching effectiveness, mastery of subject matter, scholarly ability, effectiveness of university service (including advisement of students), public service, and continuing growth.   
<dt><br>
		<dt>The assessment of faculty utilization is an on-going process.  As stated in the Faculty Handbook "It is the responsibility of the Deans in consultation with the Provost and Department Affairs and Department Chairs to develop instructional programs which will result in reasonably equal service to students, the College, and the State of New York from each member of the teaching faculty."  Specifically, the Provost conducts an annual review of faculty utilization for each academic department, including an analysis of enrollments, number of majors, general education needs, student/ faculty ratios, and SUNY benchmark information.  When vacant lines are available, they are reallocated to different departments in such a way as to maximize the efficiency, effectiveness, and the quality of the overall academic program.

	<BLOCKQUOTE><dt><A NAME="12A55">55</A>.<i>	TRAVEL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Expenses for travel on College business by State vehicle, personal car or other transportation are subject to reimbursement as outlined in <A HREF="../Appendices/APPEN14.html">Appendix XIV</A>.

		<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
	<dt><A NAME="12A55a">a</A>)	State Vehicles
<dt><br>
			<dt>The College operates a fleet of State-owned vehicles which may be used by the faculty and staff for travel on official College business.
<dt><br>
<dt>To reserve a state-owned vehicle, you must complete a Vehicle Request/Authorization Form and send it to the Office of Physical Plant, Room 518 Raymond Hall.  Keys and a vehicle use envelope may be signed out one working day in advance of travel.  Keys and credit card receipts must be returned in the completed, signed envelope, immediately upon completion of travel.
<dt><br>
<dt>If a traveler is unable to return a state-owned vehicle on schedule, he/she is required to notify the Office of Physical Plant (267-2134).
<dt><br>
<dt>A mileage charge will be made against the traveler's authorized budget for the use of a State-owned vehicle.
<dt><br>
<dt>When available, State-owned vehicles should be used rather than privately-owned vehicles.
<dt><br>
<dt>State-owned vehicles will be operated in accordance with the guidelines prepared by the Office of General Services entitled, "Driving a State Passenger Car," a copy of which is to be located in the glove compartment of each State-owned passenger vehicle.  Fuel for these vehicles should be obtained from State facilities where possible.
<dt><br>
<dt>All designated drivers of State-owned vehicles must have valid driver's licenses and must be presented when keys are issued.
<dt><br>
<dt>Students will be assigned to drive a State-owned vehicle only when it is not feasible to use another driver.  The President (or designee) must authorize all student drivers of a State-owned vehicle.  A separate authorization for the use of a student driver must be made for each trip.  Student-owned vehicles may not be used for official College business.
State-owned vehicles may be assigned to students for the purpose of conducting official business of the Student Assembly.
<dt><br>
<dt>State-owned vehicles may be used for transporting students only for the purpose of field trips required for an instructional or research program or to inter- collegiate competitions in such fields as athletics, speech, music and drama, and other social, recreational, cultural and educational programs authorized by the President (or designee), provided such events are accompanied by a member of the campus staff.
<dt><br>
	<dt>A complete list of all students traveling in a State-owned vehicle must be filed with the Office of Physical prior to each trip.

		<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A55b">b</A>)	Personal Car
<dt><br>
			<Dt>A traveler on College business using his/her personal car will be reimbursed at the State reimbursement rate in effect at the time of travel as well as for receipted tolls and receipted parking.  The reimbursement rate may not exceed that approved by the State Comptroller.  Owners of private automobiles used for travel on College business in which students are passengers are advised to carry liability insurance of $100,000/$300,000 as a minimum.

		<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A55c">c</A>)	Out-Of-State Travel
<dt><br>
			<dt>Official travel outside of the State of New York requires prior approval of the Campus President (or designee).  Direct travel through New Jersey enroute between upstate and downstate is not considered out-of-state travel.

		<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A55d">d</A>)	Lodging Requests
<dt><br>
			<Dt>Lodging requests are available from the Accounting Office and are used when it is appropriate to charge the cost of room rental to the State of New York and the motel/hotel accepts such lodging requests.
<dt><br>
<Dt>All lodging requests issued but not used must be returned to the Accounting Office for proper accountability.

		<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A55e">e</A>)	Tax Exemption Certificates
<dt><br>
			<dt>Tax exemption certificates are available from the Accounting Office if you pay lodging charges while on College business where there is a room occupancy tax (within NYS).

		<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A55f">f</A>)	Travel Expense Voucher
<dt><br>
			<dt>In order to be reimbursed for travel expenses related to college business, a travel expense voucher must be completed by 	the traveler and received in the Accounting Office after completion of travel.  If the traveler used his/her personal car the form AC160, Statement of Automobile Travel must also be completed and submitted.
</dl><!-- 2 -->
	<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A56">56</A>.	<i>TRAVEL ADVANCES</i>
<dt><br>
	<dt>Travel advances are available to individuals on College business and are issued upon request by the Accounting Office.  Travel advances are personal loans to the individual and repayment becomes the individual's responsibility.  All procedures established pursuant to travel advances are those of the New York State Department of Audit and Control and are outlined as follows:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt>a)	Lodging requests for overnight room stay should be used whenever possible.  Transportation requests should also be used for tickets whenever possible.
<dt><br>
		<dt>b)	Travel advances will be limited to those people on State payroll or specific designees of the President.
<dt><br>
		<dt>c)	Dollar amount of the travel advance will be limited to the appropriate per diem rate times the number of nights the traveler is in approved travel status up to a maximum advance of $400.00.  Plane tickets and registration fees may also be paid in advance, but these checks will only be made out to the vendor or sponsoring agent.  Tickets  and fees will not affect the $400.00 maximum advance.  Requests for advances of registration fees must be accompanied by a registration or application form.  These checks will be made out to the sponsoring agent and sent with the traveler or sent directly.
<dt><br>
		<dt>d)	All travelers wishing to receive a travel advance must fill out an Application for Travel Advance form.
<dt><br>
		<Dt>e)	As noted on the application form, it is the responsibility of the traveler to file a New York State Travel Voucher within 15 days of his/her return or a judgment affecting the traveler's next scheduled paycheck will be entered against him/her.  Revenues must continue to flow back into this system for the advance program to continue to be effective.
<dt><br>
		<dt>f)	The advance will normally be paid back by using the State of New York travel reimbursement check.  If additional funds are due the traveler, a reimbursement check will come in his/her name.  If the travel voucher falls short of the advance, the traveler will be expected to refund the balance to the account.
<dt><br>
		<dt>g)	State procedures prohibit advancing money for State vehicle or personal vehicle mileage.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Please understand that preparation of these travel advance checks takes time.  A minimum of two days should be expected for preparation of travel advance checks.  Try to plan ahead.

</dl><!-- 2 -->
	<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A59">59</A>.<i>	USE OF STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK STATIONERY</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>It is contrary to the policy of the State University of New York and the State of New York for State employees to use State agency stationery for the conduct of personal, non-agency related business.  An Executive Chamber Policy Memorandum underscores the importance of communicating this policy to employees:
<dt><br>
	<dt>"The use of State agency stationery, accompanied by the typed words `Personal and Unofficial,' constitutes an unacceptable contradiction in the message transmitted.
<dt><br>
<dt>As a matter of policy, State agency stationery should be utilized only for official governmental business.  If a communication is `personal and unofficial,' it has no business being sent on agency stationery.  Sending such communications on agency stationery could give the appearance of an inappropriate attempt to utilize the influence of an individual's office for a private purpose."
<dt><br>
		<dt>All State University employees should make every effort to keep official and personal activities separate and to avoid potential conflicts of interest.

	<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A60">60</A>.<i>	USE OF UNIVERSITY RESEARCH EQUIPMENT</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The following guidelines underscore the University's willingness to have industry use the University's research equipment through cooperative arrangements involving faculty, students, and technical staff:
<dt><br>
	<dt>SUNY Potsdam is committed to implementing arrangements for cooperative use of available research equipment, while recognizing that priority  on use of such equipment must be for the University's primary academic mission and activities of the campus.
<dt><br>
<dt>In recognition of this educational mission, proposals for cooperative use of equipment should involve faculty, students or technical staff in ways that add to their knowledge and professional skills.
<dt><br>
<Dt>Each such cooperative use of research equipment must be defined in scope (by dollar amount, time, or other quantitative measure).  Appropriate permit or contract procedures should be followed consistent with the procedures developed for the administration of sponsored programs and the use of University facilities by outside organizations.
<dt><br>
<dt>In order to ensure that necessary priority is given to ongoing University research and educational programs the determination  regarding the availability of particular items of equipment for cooperative use should rest with the Provost, or designee, in consultation with the principal research investigators.
<dt><br>
<dt>University facility and equipment services will not be provided to non-University organizations or individuals in direct competition with private companies that provide equivalent equipment services on a commercial basis in the geographic region.
<dt><br>
<dt>Under normal circumstances, full cost, both direct and indirect must be recovered, including special costs relating directly to security, insurance and indemnification protection for the University.
<dt><br>
<dt>All arrangements must be consistent with Board of Trustees' policies.  Non-University organizations and individuals, who utilize University research facilities under such cooperative arrangements, will retain ownership of all patentable inventions or discoveries.
<dt><br>
<dt>Consistent with Trustees' Policies, patent and licensing rights may also be subject to provisions of formal agreements with industrial sponsors of University research programs.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Responsibility for the management of these Guidelines lies with the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs, to which all inquiries should be directed.

	<dt><br>
<A NAME="12A61">61.  </A>WHEELED VEHICLES<BR>
<BR>
SUNY Potsdam recognizes that skateboards, roller blades, bicycles and other wheeled vehicles or devices are legitimate of both exercise and transportation.  However, some people chose to utilize these items in other than a conventional manner, thereby creating a physical danger to themselves and others as well as a hazard to property.  In an effort to continue to provide for the open use of college property of these modes of transportation, the following guidelines are adopted.<BR>
<BR>
1.  Trick or stunt riding is prohibited.  Trick or stunt riding is defined as repetitive or competitive moves where wheels leave the surface.  Vehicles or devices used in such a manner are subject to impounding.<BR>
2.  No wheeled vehicle or device for personal transportation may be used in any campus building.   Wheel chairs and youth stollers are exempt from this provision.<BR>
3.  Skateboards, bicylcles, roller blades and similar wheeled devices are prohibited from any tennis court surface.<BR>
4.  Skateboards and roller blades using sidewalks will do so safely and will yield the right of way to predestrians.<BR>
5.  Skateboards and roller blades using campus roadways will travel in the right lane of traffic only, as close to the right hand curb as is feasible and safe.<BR>
<BR>

	<dt><A NAME="12A62">62</A>.<i>	WORK WEEK FOR EMPLOYEES IN THE CLASSIFIED SERVICE</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The basic work week for full-time classified employees in maintenance and public safety positions is 40 hours a week.  For other classified employees (non-shift) such as those in secretarial and clerical positions, it is 37 1/2 hours a week.  Except in certain situations, the work week consists of five consecutive days working and 2 consecutive days off.  For time accruals and payroll purposes, the work week begins on  Thursday and ends on Wednesday.

	<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A63">63</A>.<i>	WORK DAY FOR EMPLOYEES IN THE CLASSIFIED SERVICE</i>
<dt><br>

<CENTER><B>APPENDIX VI</B></CENTER>
<BR>

<B><CENTER>NEW YORK STATE ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT ACT</CENTER></B>
<BR>

NEW YORK STATE ETHICS COMMISSION RULES
<BR>
<BR>

A.	OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES
<BR>
<BR>

	Applicability
<BR>
<BR>

	The limitations on outside activities apply to State policy-makers only.  Within the University, policy-makers generally are considered to be those employees at the level of Dean and above at the campuses and Associate Vice Chancellor and above in the System Administration.
<BR>
<BR>

General Requirements
<BR>
<BR>

All policy-makers are prohibited from serving as an officer of a political party or political organization or as a member of a national committee of a political party.
<BR>
<BR>

The regulations further require that salaried policy-makers obtain the prior approval of the Campus President and the Ethics Commission before;

	<BLOCKQUOTE>-	holding other public office or engaging in other public employment for more than nominal compensation (defined as:  greater than the normal per diem or $4000 annually);
<BR>
<BR>

	-	engaging in any private employment, business or other activity (including not-for-profit) for more than the defined nominal compensation; and
<BR>
<BR>

	-	serving as director or officer of a for-profit corporation or institution, regardless of compensation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	Prior approval of limited to the Campus President is required when salaried policy-makers engage in private employment or other activity for annual compensation between $1000 and $4000.
<BR>
<BR>

Approval of any request to engage in outside activities must be based upon consistency of the activity with the ethical standards in sections 73 and 74 of the Public Officers Law booklet and a determination that the activity does not interfere or conflict with the proper and effective discharge of the employee's SUNY responsibilities (see also Policies of the Board of Trustees, Article XI, Title H, 4 (8 NYCRR 355.26)). 
<BR>
<BR>

Procedures for Requesting Approval

<BLOCKQUOTE>1.	Where both University and Commission approvals are required, requests are to be made on forms provided by the Ethics Commission.
<BR>
<BR>

	2.	At the campuses, request forms should be submitted first by affected employees to the President.  Requests for approval of outside activities involving a President should be submitted to the Executive Vice Chancellor.  Those requests approved on campus should be transmitted directly to the Ethics Commission for approval, with a copy to the Executive Vice Chancellor.  Approved requests of a President will be submitted to the Ethics Commission by the Executive Vice Chancellor.
<BR>
<BR>

	3.	Where approval of the University alone is required by the regulations (i.e., request involving annual compensation from a private business of between $1000 and $4000), the official form can be modified or approval may be requested on a letter submitted by the employee.  The same procedures as above should be followed except that no further approvals beyond the appropriate President is required.</BLOCKQUOTE>

B.	HONORARIA AND TRAVEL
<BR>
<BR>

	The regulations on receipt of honoraria and travel reimbursement apply to all compensated State employees, with the exception of academic employees in SUNY and CUNY engaging in activities within their academic discipline.
  <BR>
<BR>
   
	Honoraria
<BR>
<BR>

Under the regulations, an honorarium is defined as a "payment, fee, or other compensation made as a gratuity or as an award or honor" for services rendered by a covered employee not related to the covered employee's official duties.  It also includes a payment for travel expenses incurred by the employee in the course of services unrelated to the employee's duties.  The regulations set forth specific conditions under which honoraria may be expected.
<BR>
<BR>

Obtaining prior approval of requests to receive honoraria is optional rather than mandatory.  Requests, if made, are subject only to University action and the filing of the determination with the Ethics Commission.  Employees receiving honoraria without prior approval of the University, however, are required to report annually (April 1) to their campus or System Administration, as appropriate, the source, date, amount, and nature of the activities for which honoraria were received in the previous year.  In turn, a compilation of individual reports must be filed with the Ethics Commission on an annual basis (June 1).  Employees who have obtained prior approval from the University of requests to receive honoraria need not file these annual reports.  No special form for submission of the request for prior approval or the annual report has been specified.
<BR>
<BR>

Requests for prior approval of honoraria or annual reports regarding honoraria should be submitted by affected employees to the President or the President's designee.  Requests or reports involving a President should be submitted to the Executive Chancellor.  The campus designee or Executive Vice Chancellor, as appropriate, will be responsible for filing approved advance requests for receipt of honoraria and annual reports with the Ethics Commission.	<BR>
<BR>
Travel Expense Reimbursement
<BR>
<BR>

	Advance approval by the campus is required for receipt of travel expense reimbursement related to an employee's official duties.  The same process described for advance approval of honoraria should be utilized for approval of travel reimbursement that complies with the criteria contained in the regulations.  No filing with the Ethics Commission are required.
<BR>
<BR>

Any honorarium or travel reimbursement received which is over $1000 must also be reported on an employee's annual financial disclosure statement, where filing of that form is required.
<BR>
<BR>

Any questions relating to the compliance with these regulations may be directed to the Office of University Counsel at (518) 443-5400.
<BR>
<BR>

C.	FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
       <BR>
<BR>
       
	Who Must File

	You must file an annual statement of financial disclosure if you are:
<BR>

	<BLOCKQUOTE>3.	A political party chair, as such term is defined in Section 73(l)(k) of the Public Officers Law.
<BR>
<BR>

		"State agency means any State department,  division, board, commission, or bureau of any state department, any public benefit corporation, public authority or commission at least one  of whose members is appointed by the Governor, or the State University of New York or the City University of New York, including all their constituent units except community colleges and the independent institutions operating statutory or contract colleges on behalf of the State.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>NOTE:	A person who is employed in more than one employment capacity for one or more state agencies and who receives distinctly separate payments of compensation for such employment must file an annual disclosure statement if the aggregate annual compensation for all such employment activities is in excess of fifty-three thousand one hundred seventy-one dollars ($53,171), nothwithstanding that such person would not otherwise be required to file with respect to any one particular employment capacity and he or she has not received an exemption from filing.  One filing will suffice.
<BR>
<BR>

A person whose services in more than one employment or appointive capacity, some or each of which would require filing a financial disclosure statement with the State Ethics Commission, need only file one such disclosure statement with a written indication that the filing is for all those positions for which the individual must file a financial disclosure.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

		When To File
<BR>
<BR>

		May 15.  For all statewide elected officials, state officers and employees, and political party chairs.
<BR>
<BR>

		After May 15.  Any person required to file such statement, including political party chairs, who commences employment, is designated as serving in a policy-making position by his or her appointing authoring or becomes a political party chair after May 15 of any year, shall file such statement within thirty (30) days after commencing employment or of taking the position of political party chair.
<BR>
<BR>

November 1.  All academic employees who earn over $53,171 file an abbreviated financial disclosure form.
<BR>
<BR>

Extension Of Time
<BR>
<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>a)	Justifiable Cause or Undue Hardship
<BR>
<BR>

	You may request an extension of time to file a financial disclosure statement in accordance with the Commission's rules set forth at  Part 936 NYCRR (New York Code of Rules and Regulations) on the ground of justifiable cause or undue hardship.  You must file your request on or before May 1.  A REQUEST FOR AN EXTENSION OF TIME DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY EXTEND YOUR TIME TO FILE.
<BR>
<BR>

		b)	Internal Revenue Service Automatic Extension of Time
<BR>
<BR>

			If you have timely filed with the Internal Revenue Service an application for an automatic extension of time in which to file your individual income tax return, you may indicate which items in the disclosure form are subject to the automatic extension of time and may file such information in a supplementary statement of financial disclosure on or before the seventh day after the expiration of the period of such automatic extension of time.  YOU MUST FILE A FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FOR THOSE ITEMS NOT SUBJECT TO THE AUTOMATIC EXTENSION OF TIME TOGETHER WITH A COPY OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE APPLICATION, unless you are granted an extension of time to file the complete statement for justifiable cause or undue hardship (see (a) above).</BLOCKQUOTE>

		Where To File
<BR>
<BR>

		NEW YORK STATE ETHICS COMMISSION
		P.O. Box 22007
		Albany, New York 12201-2007

<center><strong>XIII.  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</strong></center>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="13F">F.</A>	<b>RACIAL AND ETHNIC HARASSMENT</b>

	<blockquote><dt>
<dt><A NAME="13F1">1</A>.	<i>INTRODUCTION</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>An atmosphere of mutual respect among members of the academic community is necessary for SUNY Potsdam to function as a center of academic freedom and intellectual advancement.  Any violation of mutual trust, any form of intimidation or exploitation, damages the institution's educational process by undermining the essential freedoms of inquiry and expression.  Students, teachers, and staff must feel personally secure for real learning to take place.
<dt><br>
		<dt>As a place of work and study, SUNY Potsdam must be free of racial and ethnic harassment and all forms of racial and ethnic intimidation and exploitation.  All students, staff, and faculty must be assured that the Collage will take action to prevent such misconduct and that anyone who engages in such behavior is subject to disciplinary procedures.

	<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13F2">2</A>.	<i>DEFINITION</i>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt>a)	Intimidating verbal, written or symbolic communications or physical conduct of a racial or ethnic nature that is abusive toward another individual based on direct or implied discrimination. 
<dt><br>
		<dt>b)	Verbal, written or symbolic communications that have the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's performance, or of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive University environment.
</dl>
	<dt>
<dt><A NAME="13F3">3</A>.	<i>POLICY</i>
        <dt><br>
		<dt>SUNY Potsdam is committed to maintaining an academic residential and working environment which is free of inappropriate and disrespectful conduct of a racial or ethnic nature, especially when such conduct adversely affects a student's or an employee's work environment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive campus environment.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Racial and ethnic harassment is a prohibited personnel practice when it has the effect or purpose of abusing others based or implied discrimination.  It is also a prohibited personnel practice when it interferes with an individual's academic, social or work performance.  The effect may include, but is not limited to:  immobilizing anguish, withdrawal from a course, a major, a school, a residence, a department or a career.
<dt><br>
		<dt>This policy applies only to employee-employee or employee-student cases of racial or ethnic harassment.  (Student-student racial or ethnic harassment cases must be reported to the Assistant to President for Affirmative Action or the Assistant Vice President for Student Development and heard in the Student Judicial System.)

	<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13F4">4</A>.	<i>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Any student or employee who feels she/he may have been racially or ethnically harassed by another employee is strongly encouraged to report any episode(s) to the Assistant to President for Affirmative Action.
        <dt><br>
		<dt>There are three established procedures for processing a racial or ethnic harassment complaint:<br>
		<dt>--	Informal Grievance Procedures;<br>
		<dt>--	Formal Procedures;<br>
		<dt>--	External Administrative or Judicial Proceedings (bypassing SUNY Potsdam's internal procedures).
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt>a)	Informal Grievance Procedure
<dt><br>

			<dt>i)	The primary objective of all informal procedures is to discover and identify whether racial or ethnic harassment has in fact occurred.  To that end, a student or employee who feels she or he has been harassed by an employee is encouraged to consult with the Assistant to President for Affirmative Action.  Careful consideration of the definition of racial or ethnic harassment and a detailed review of the student's or employee's experience will take place.

<B><CENTER>APPENDIX XVIII
<BR>
<BR>

CHANCELLOR'S STATEMENT ON GOVERNANCE</CENTER></B>

<BR>

Following considerable discussion about the matter of enforcement of by-laws on local campuses, and following conferences among the Committee on Governance, the Executive Committee, the President's Council, and with the Board of Trustees, the Chancellor has developed the following Statement on Governance:
<BR>
<BR>

In the light of recent challenges to the basic structural elements of the University, I join with the Faculty Senate in affirming the validity of governance as the appropriate and organic process for the involvement of constituent groups in campus decision making.  By this statement, University faculty, staff, and administration are reminded of the charge contained in the 1972 Master Plan that "the governance arrangements within the university will be increasingly clarified and improved methods of consultation will be developed to reflect the need for effective governance based upon widespread participation.."
<BR>
<BR>

Since these challenges go to the very heart of the University, it is appropriate to underscore the traditional legal framework which establishes and protects University governance.
<BR>
<BR>

The Education Law established the Board of Trustees and charges it with the responsibility for and conduct of the University.  The Trustees, in turn, have promulgated The Policies of the Board of Trustees, et al that represent a constitution which provides basic principles of policy and organization.  The Policies of the Board of Trustees, et al vest authority in the Chancellor of the University and in campus presidents and legally established governance as the appropriate vehicle for the involvement of all constituents: faculty, staff, administration, and students.  In this regard, The Policies of the Board of Trustees, et al accord official recognition to the close interrelation between the exercise of the legal authority of the president and his or her obligation to accept constituent participation through governance.
<BR>
<BR>

Article X of The Policies of the Trustees, et al, among other provisions, empowers and directs the faculty to develop by-laws for the conduct of its affairs.  Substantive actions taken in the course of that conduct are advisory upon the president and are a recognition of his or her legal authority.  Furthermore, those provisions of by-laws concerning consultation--how, when, and where the president consults wit his faculty--are subject to his or her approval.  It is understood, of course, that by-laws often contain procedures for consultation among faculty in addition to provisions for presidential consultation with faculty.  The latter only is spoken to in Article X.
<BR>
<BR>

When the president accepts provisions of local by-laws concerning consultation, the Trustees, through Article X, and the Chancellor respect this endorsement and these provisions become, thereby, part of local policy and must provide a reliable framework for campus governance.  In this regard, a president is expected to adhere to policies which he or she has accepted for his or her administration.
<BR>
<BR>

Since governance must remain responsive to changing conditions on each campus, the validity of by-laws rests firmly upon the continuing confidence in which they are held.  By-laws, once approved, should not be used to require adherence to outmoded or bad practice by either the faculty or the president.  The campus community must remain ready to recognize legitimate objections to practices or procedures which no longer adequately meet the needs for which they were designed.  In order for governance to operate effectively, provisions must exist in each set of by-laws to permit the president and any constituent included in the governance vehicle to initiate review and modification when by-laws fail to command the confidence of those who are expected to observe them.
<BR>
<BR>

By-laws are the manifestation of the university's commitment to governance.  They have their legal basis in authorization by the Board of Trustees and their effectiveness results, in the most practical sense, from the confidence they enjoy in the campus community.  If governance is to survive, it must draw strength from its success in meeting the needs for which it was designed.  It must not rely upon external forces.  Its validity is adequately supported in the legal recognition of governance by the Trustees as essential to the proper conduct of a university.

<center><strong>XIII.  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</strong></center>
<BR>

<BR>
<dt><A NAME="13E4">4</A>.	<i>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Any student or employee who feels she or he may have been sexually harassed by another employee is strongly encouraged to report any episode(s) to the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action.
<dt><br>
		<dt>There are three established procedures for processing a sexual harassment complaint:<br>
		<dt>--	Informal Grievance Procedures;<br>
		<dt>--	Formal Procedures;<br>
		<dt>--	External Administrative or Judicial Proceedings (bypassing SUNY Potsdam's internal procedures).
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt>a)	Informal Grievance Procedure
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	The primary objective of all informal procedures is to discover and identify whether sexual harassment has in fact occurred.  To that end, a student or employee who feels she or he has been harassed by an employee is encouraged to consult with the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action.  Careful consideration of the definition of sexual harassment and a detailed review of the student's or employee's experience will take place.  Discussions at this informal level are treated as confidential.  No formal records are maintained, and the student or employee will be assured as much anonymity as possible.
<dt><br>
			<dt>ii)	A second goal is to explore with the student or employee the various alternatives available to her or him in response to the situation.  The ultimate goal is to support and assist the student or employee in implementing the approach chosen in order to reach a satisfactory resolution.
<dt><br>
			<dt>iii)	Both parties -- the complainant and the respondent (alleged harasser) -- have the right to appear with an advisor during any stage of the proceedings.  Advisors may accompany the parties for support and consultation but may not actively participate, i.e., speak in the proceedings.
<dt><br>
			<dt>iv)	Recommended actions include, but are not limited to:  a) a direct conversation between the student or employee and the alleged harasser, b) a letter written by the student or employee to the alleged harasser, and c) a conversation between the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action and the alleged harasser on behalf of the student or employee.
<dt><br>
			<dt>v)	Time frame
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 4 -->
				<dt>(a)	Employees must file a grievance within 45 calendar days following an alleged case of sexual harassment.

<dt><br>
				<dt>(d)	If satisfactory resolution is not possible within 14 calendar days, the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action shall so notify grievant advising her/him of the right to proceed to next step internally or with appropriate agencies.
</dl><!-- 4 -->
</dl><!-- 3 -->
<dt><br>
		<dt>b)	Formal Grievance Procedure
<dt><br>
			<dt>The SUNY Grievance Procedure for Reviewing Allegations of Illegal Discrimination will be employed in cases of sexual harassment.  This procedure, which may be used by a SUNY student or an employee, provides an additional mechanism through which the University may identify and initiate procedures to eliminate incidents of illegal discrimination.
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	Written Statement
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 4 -->
				<dt>(a)	A formal complaint of sexual harassment must include a written statement signed by the complainant specifying the incident(s) of sexual harassment.  The statement may be prepared by the complainant as a record of the complaint with assistance from the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action.  
<dt><br>
				<dt>(b)	Grievances must be filed with the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action.  The College will prevent retaliation against the complainant for filing a complaint.

<dt><br>
					<dt>(5)	The grievant may, in such cases, request an outside hearing officer review the charge.  Such request must be made in writing by the grievant to the grievant chairperson within five days from notification that a campus tripartite committee cannot be formed.
<dt><br>
					<dt>(6)	The request for an outside hearing officer shall be made in writing by the grievant to the appropriate grievance chairperson.  The chairperson shall submit a written statement within 5 days to the Executive Assistant to the Chancellor for Affirmative Action requesting that an outside hearing officer be appointed.

                  GRIEVANCES PROCEDURES FOR STATE EMPLOYEES
<BR>
<BR>

                            EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 42</CENTER></B>
<BR>

     With the advent of collective negotiations between the State and employee organizations pursuant to the Public Employees' Fair Employment Act of 1967, collectively negotiated agreements ("collective agreements") have been entered into which provide for grievance procedures which are intended to supersede in whole or in part the grievance procedures provided for by the Executive Order heretofore issued on August 28, 1963.  Such negotiated grievance procedures are a milestone in the development of collective negotiations in the public sector.  Nevertheless, there is still an important reason for the continuation of procedures for the settlement of grievances of employees who are not covered by collective agreements or for the settlement of non-contract grievances which are outside of the scope of the grievance procedure set forth in any such collective agreement.
<BR>
<BR>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>1.   Every employee to whom this order applies shall have the right to           present his/her grievance in accordance with this order, free from interference, coercion, restraint, discrimination or reprisal.   He/she shall have the right to present his/her grievance individually or with a representative of his/her own choosing at all           steps of the grievance procedure hereunder, except that where there is in effect a collective agreement covering a negotiation unit which includes such employee which was entered into between the State and an employee organization, then such employee may not choose as his/her representative any employee organization other than the employee organization with which such agreement was negotiated nor may any employee organization other than the one with which such agreement was negotiated initiate or process a grievance except to the extent permitted by such agreement.
<BR>
<BR>

     2.   Grievance Appeals Board.  The Grievance Appeals Board established by  the executive order heretofore issued on August 28, 1963 shall be transferred to the Office of Employee Relations.  It shall consist of three members appointed by and who shall serve at the pleasure of the Director of Employee Relations.  No person regularly employed in a full time position in the State service shall be eligible for appointment to the Board.  One member shall be designated by the Director to serve as chairperson of the Board.  The compensation of the members of the Board shall be fixed by the Director with the approval of the Director of the Budget.
<BR>
<BR>

     3.   Departmental Procedures. The head of each State department or agency shall, subject to the approval of the Grievance Appeals Board established pursuant to this order, establish formal procedures for the submission of grievances by employees and for the prompt and orderly consideration and determination of such grievances by supervisors and the department or agency head.
<BR>
<BR>

   4.   Powers and Duties of the Grievance Appeals Board.  The Grievance Appeals Board is hereby charged with the responsibility for and empowered to: </BLOCKQUOTE>

          <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>a)  establish and maintain a program for resolving employee grievances relating to conditions of employment in the State service not inconsistent with the State's obligations as an employer under the Public Employee's Fair Employment Act of 1967 or collective agreements entered into thereunder.
<BR>
<BR>

          b)  promulgate and amend from time to time, with the approval of the  Director of Employee Relations, such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this order and to review and approve grievance procedures established by  departments and agencies pursuant to this order and such regulations, including provisions for reasonable time off without charge to leave credits for grievants, representatives and witnesses.
<BR>
<BR>

          c)  hold hearings, to conduct investigations, to require the attendance of officers and employees of the State as witnesses and to require the production or examination of records, books and papers of State departments or agencies relating to administration of the grievance procedure.
<BR>
<BR>

          d)  render advice and assistance to officers and employees of State  departments and agencies in any matter relating to the establishment or use of the procedures provided for or adopted pursuant to this order or the regulations issued thereunder.
<BR>
<BR>

          e)  report to the Director of Employee Relations for appropriate  action the failure of any department or agency to establish properly or maintain satisfactorily the standards, principles,  determinations and procedures embodied in or authorized by this order.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>5.   Appeals.  An employee within a time limit and upon compliance with the regulations of the Board, may appeal to the Board from a determination made pursuant to this order by the head of his department or agency, or his designated representative, as the case may be.  The Board shall conduct such review of the appeal as it deems appropriate and may require the appearance before it of the appellant and other parties to the grievance; provided, however,  that the appellant shall be entitled upon his/her request to a hearing before the Board or its designee.  If the appeal involves the enforcement of a law, a civil service rule or regulation or a written rule, regulation or order of a department or agency, the findings of fact and the recommendation of the Board shall be transmitted to the departments or agencies involved for appropriate action in accordance with the facts found by the Board.  In all           other cases, the determination of the Board shall contain a statement of the facts and an advisory recommendation to the departments or agencies involved.  Copies of the determination of the Board shall be sent to the employee involved, to his representative and to the Director of Employee Relations.
<BR>
<BR>

     6.   Application</BLOCKQUOTE>

          <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>a)  The provisions of this order shall apply to employees in the executive branch of the State government (1) who are not covered               by a collective agreement between the State and a certified or recognized employee organization or (2) who are covered by a collective agreement which accords such employees the right to continue to process grievances under this order.
<BR>
<BR>

          b)  The provisions of this order and the procedures established hereunder shall be applicable to grievances in any department or agency claiming an act or omission resulting in an injustice to an employee or arising out of conditions which are in whole or in part subject to the control of the head of such department or agency and which involve alleged safety or health hazards, unsatisfactory physical facilities, surroundings, materials or equipment, unfair or discriminatory supervisory and disciplinary practice, unjust treatment by fellow workers, unreasonable assignment of working hours or personal time allowances, unfair or unreasonable work quotas, and all other grievances relating to conditions of employment; provided, however, that this order shall not apply to matters which are reviewable under administrative procedures established by law or under the rule of the State Civil Service Commission, or the rules of other department or agencies having the force and effect of law or rules governing grievances of employees in the professional service of the State University of New York as defined in Section 355-a of the Education Law, or grievance concerning the interpretation, application or claimed violation of a specific               term or provision of a collective agreement between the State and an employee organization.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>7.   Repeal of Previous Order.  The Executive Order heretofore issued on August 28, 1963 is hereby revoked and superseded by this executive order.  Grievances initiated but not finally resolved prior to the effective date of this order may be continued under the terms of the executive order issued on August 28, 1963.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="13E">E</A>.	<b>SEXUAL HARASSMENT</b>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
	<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13E1">1</A>.	<i>INTRODUCTION</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>An atmosphere of mutual respect among members of the academic community is necessary for SUNY Potsdam to function as a center of academic freedom and intellectual advancement.  Any violation of mutual trust, any form of intimidation or exploitation, damages the institution's educational process by undermining the essential freedoms of inquiry and expression.  Students, teachers, and staff must feel personally secure for real learning to take place.
<dt><br>
		<dt>As a place of work and study, SUNY Potsdam must be free of sexual harassment an all forms of sexual intimidation and exploitation.  All students, staff, and faculty must be assured that the College will take action to prevent such misconduct and that anyone who engages in such behavior is subject to disciplinary procedures.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Sexual harassment is not simply inappropriate behavior; it is against the law.  Title VII (Section 703) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees from sexual harassment in that it is a form of unlawful sex discrimination.  title IX, enforced by the Office of Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education, protects both students and employees from sexual harassment in that it constitutes differential treatment on the basis of sex.  (Title IX applies to any educational institution receiving Federal funds.)

	<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13E2">2</A>.	<i>DEFINITION</i>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt>a)	Sexual harassment is characterized by the imposition of unwelcome sexual activity including:<br>
			<dt>--	unwelcome sexual advances,<br>
			<dt>--	requests for sexual favors,<br>
			<dt>--	and other intimidating verbal or written communications or physical conduct of a sexual nature.
<dt><br>
		<dt>b)	Such unwelcome sexual activity often occurs in relationships of unequal power, between a faculty member and student or supervisor and employee.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Consenting romantic and sexual relationships between a faculty member and student, or supervisor and employee, while not expressly forbidden, are generally deemed unwise.  A faculty member who enters into a sexual relationship with a student (or a supervisor with an employee) where a professional power differential exits, must realize that, if a charge of sexual harassment is subsequently lodged, it will be exceedingly difficult to prove a defense on grounds of mutual consent.
<dt><br>
		<dt>c)	Such unwelcome sexual activity also occurs in relationships of equal power:  between colleagues or between students.  Sexual harassment can occur between a student and faculty member, with the latter as victim.
<dt><br>
		<dt>d)	Sexual Harassment is defined as follows*:  Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment when:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	Submission to or rejection of such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or a condition of instruction, employment, or participation in other University activity; and/or --
<dt><br>
			<dt>ii)	Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for evaluation in making academic or personnel decisions affecting an individual; and/or --
<dt><br>
			<dt>iii)	Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the individual's performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive University environment.
<dt><br>
				<dt>*This definition is an adaptation of the EEOC Guidelines prohibiting sexual harassment in the employment context under Title VII.  
</dl><!-- 3 -->
</dl><!-- 2 -->
	<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13E3">3</A>.	<i>POLICY</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>SUNY Potsdam is committed to maintaining an academic and working environment which is free of inappropriate and disrespectful conduct and communication of a sexual nature, especially when such conduct is imposed by one on another and adversely affects a student's academic performance or an employee's work environment.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Sexual harassment is a prohibited personnel practice when it results in discrimination for or against an employee on the basis of conduct not related to work performance, such as the taking or refusal to take a personnel action, including promotion of employees who resist or protest sexual overtures, or when such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.
<dt><br>
		<dt>This policy applies only to employee-employee or employee-student cases of sexual harassment.  (Student-student sexual harassment cases must be reported to the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action or the Assistant Vice President for Student Development and be heard in the Student Judicial System.)
<dt><br>
		<dt>Sexual harassment is also a prohibited academic practice when it results in discrimination for or against a student on the basis of conduct not related to academic performance including, but not limited to, such academic reprisals as a lowered grade, denied recommendations, appointments or job referrals.  Additionally, such conduct is prohibited if it has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive academic environment.  The effect may include, but is not limited to, immobilizing anguish, withdrawal from a course, a major, a school or a career.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Terms Defined:
		Grievance/Complainant:  Alleged victim (any student or employee) of sexual harassment <br> 
		<dt>Respondent:  Alleged harasser (any student or employee) accused of sexual harassment

<CENTER><B>APPENDIX VI</B></CENTER>
<BR>

<B><CENTER>NEW YORK STATE ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT ACT</CENTER></B>
<BR>

NEW YORK STATE ETHICS COMMISSION RULES
<BR>
<BR>

A.	OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES
<BR>
<BR>

	Applicability
<BR>
<BR>

	The limitations on outside activities apply to State policy-makers only.  Within the University, policy-makers generally are considered to be those employees at the level of Dean and above at the campuses and Associate Vice Chancellor and above in the System Administration.
<BR>
<BR>

General Requirements
<BR>
<BR>

All policy-makers are prohibited from serving as an officer of a political party or political organization or as a member of a national committee of a political party.
<BR>
<BR>

The regulations further require that salaried policy-makers obtain the prior approval of the Campus President and the Ethics Commission before;

	<BLOCKQUOTE>-	holding other public office or engaging in other public employment for more than nominal compensation (defined as:  greater than the normal per diem or $4000 annually);
<BR>
<BR>

	-	engaging in any private employment, business or other activity (including not-for-profit) for more than the defined nominal compensation; and
<BR>
<BR>

	-	serving as director or officer of a for-profit corporation or institution, regardless of compensation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	Prior approval of limited to the Campus President is required when salaried policy-makers engage in private employment or other activity for annual compensation between $1000 and $4000.
<BR>
<BR>

Approval of any request to engage in outside activities must be based upon consistency of the activity with the ethical standards in sections 73 and 74 of the Public Officers Law booklet and a determination that the activity does not interfere or conflict with the proper and effective discharge of the employee's SUNY responsibilities (see also Policies of the Board of Trustees, Article XI, Title H, 4 (8 NYCRR 355.26)). 
<BR>
<BR>

Procedures for Requesting Approval

<BLOCKQUOTE>1.	Where both University and Commission approvals are required, requests are to be made on forms provided by the Ethics Commission.
<BR>
<BR>

	2.	At the campuses, request forms should be submitted first by affected employees to the President.  Requests for approval of outside activities involving a President should be submitted to the Executive Vice Chancellor.  Those requests approved on campus should be transmitted directly to the Ethics Commission for approval, with a copy to the Executive Vice Chancellor.  Approved requests of a President will be submitted to the Ethics Commission by the Executive Vice Chancellor.
<BR>
<BR>

	3.	Where approval of the University alone is required by the regulations (i.e., request involving annual compensation from a private business of between $1000 and $4000), the official form can be modified or approval may be requested on a letter submitted by the employee.  The same procedures as above should be followed except that no further approvals beyond the appropriate President is required.</BLOCKQUOTE>

B.	HONORARIA AND TRAVEL
<BR>
<BR>

	The regulations on receipt of honoraria and travel reimbursement apply to all compensated State employees, with the exception of academic employees in SUNY and CUNY engaging in activities within their academic discipline.
  <BR>
<BR>
   
	Honoraria
<BR>
<BR>

Under the regulations, an honorarium is defined as a "payment, fee, or other compensation made as a gratuity or as an award or honor" for services rendered by a covered employee not related to the covered employee's official duties.  It also includes a payment for travel expenses incurred by the employee in the course of services unrelated to the employee's duties.  The regulations set forth specific conditions under which honoraria may be expected.
<BR>
<BR>

Obtaining prior approval of requests to receive honoraria is optional rather than mandatory.  Requests, if made, are subject only to University action and the filing of the determination with the Ethics Commission.  Employees receiving honoraria without prior approval of the University, however, are required to report annually (April 1) to their campus or System Administration, as appropriate, the source, date, amount, and nature of the activities for which honoraria were received in the previous year.  In turn, a compilation of individual reports must be filed with the Ethics Commission on an annual basis (June 1).  Employees who have obtained prior approval from the University of requests to receive honoraria need not file these annual reports.  No special form for submission of the request for prior approval or the annual report has been specified.
<BR>
<BR>

Requests for prior approval of honoraria or annual reports regarding honoraria should be submitted by affected employees to the President or the President's designee.  Requests or reports involving a President should be submitted to the Executive Chancellor.  The campus designee or Executive Vice Chancellor, as appropriate, will be responsible for filing approved advance requests for receipt of honoraria and annual reports with the Ethics Commission.	<BR>
<BR>
Travel Expense Reimbursement
<BR>
<BR>

	Advance approval by the campus is required for receipt of travel expense reimbursement related to an employee's official duties.  The same process described for advance approval of honoraria should be utilized for approval of travel reimbursement that complies with the criteria contained in the regulations.  No filing with the Ethics Commission are required.
<BR>
<BR>

Any honorarium or travel reimbursement received which is over $1000 must also be reported on an employee's annual financial disclosure statement, where filing of that form is required.
<BR>
<BR>

Any questions relating to the compliance with these regulations may be directed to the Office of University Counsel at (518) 443-5400.
<BR>
<BR>

C.	FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
       <BR>
<BR>
       
	Who Must File
<BR>
<BR>

	You must file an annual statement of financial disclosure if you are:
<BR>
<BR>

	<BLOCKQUOTE>1.	A statewide elected official;
<BR>
<BR>

	2.	A state officer or employee, which includes:</BLOCKQUOTE>

		<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>a)	heads of state departments, their deputies and assistants;
<BR>
<BR>

		b)	all officers and employees of statewide elected officials, officers and employees of any state agencies</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

			<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>i)	who receive an annual compensation in excess of $53,171 and who have not received an exemption from filing, or
<BR>
<BR>

			ii)	who have been designated as serving in policy-making positions.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

		<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>c)	members or directors of public authorities, other than multi- state authorities, public benefit corporations and commissions at least one of whose members is appointed by the Governor; and  employees of such public authorities, public benefit corporations and commissions who</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

			<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>i)	receive an annual salary in excess of $53,171; or
<BR>
<BR>

			ii)	have been designed as serving in policy-making positions.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

	<BLOCKQUOTE>3.	A political party chair, as such term is defined in Section 73(l)(k) of the Public Officers Law.
<BR>
<BR>

		"State agency means any State department,  division, board, commission, or bureau of any state department, any public benefit corporation, public authority or commission at least one  of whose members is appointed by the Governor, or the State University of New York or the City University of New York, including all their constituent units except community colleges and the independent institutions operating statutory or contract colleges on behalf of the State.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>NOTE:	A person who is employed in more than one employment capacity for one or more state agencies and who receives distinctly separate payments of compensation for such employment must file an annual disclosure statement if the aggregate annual compensation for all such employment activities is in excess of fifty-three thousand one hundred seventy-one dollars ($53,171), nothwithstanding that such person would not otherwise be required to file with respect to any one particular employment capacity and he or she has not received an exemption from filing.  One filing will suffice.
<BR>
<BR>

A person whose services in more than one employment or appointive capacity, some or each of which would require filing a financial disclosure statement with the State Ethics Commission, need only file one such disclosure statement with a written indication that the filing is for all those positions for which the individual must file a financial disclosure.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

		When To File
<BR>
<BR>

		May 15.  For all statewide elected officials, state officers and employees, and political party chairs.
<BR>
<BR>

		After May 15.  Any person required to file such statement, including political party chairs, who commences employment, is designated as serving in a policy-making position by his or her appointing authoring or becomes a political party chair after May 15 of any year, shall file such statement within thirty (30) days after commencing employment or of taking the position of political party chair.
<BR>
<BR>

November 1.  All academic employees who earn over $53,171 file an abbreviated financial disclosure form.
<BR>
<BR>

Extension Of Time
<BR>
<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>a)	Justifiable Cause or Undue Hardship
<BR>
<BR>

	You may request an extension of time to file a financial disclosure statement in accordance with the Commission's rules set forth at  Part 936 NYCRR (New York Code of Rules and Regulations) on the ground of justifiable cause or undue hardship.  You must file your request on or before May 1.  A REQUEST FOR AN EXTENSION OF TIME DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY EXTEND YOUR TIME TO FILE.
<BR>
<BR>

		b)	Internal Revenue Service Automatic Extension of Time
<BR>
<BR>

			If you have timely filed with the Internal Revenue Service an application for an automatic extension of time in which to file your individual income tax return, you may indicate which items in the disclosure form are subject to the automatic extension of time and may file such information in a supplementary statement of financial disclosure on or before the seventh day after the expiration of the period of such automatic extension of time.  YOU MUST FILE A FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FOR THOSE ITEMS NOT SUBJECT TO THE AUTOMATIC EXTENSION OF TIME TOGETHER WITH A COPY OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE APPLICATION, unless you are granted an extension of time to file the complete statement for justifiable cause or undue hardship (see (a) above).</BLOCKQUOTE>

		Where To File
<BR>
<BR>

		NEW YORK STATE ETHICS COMMISSION
		P.O. Box 22007
		Albany, New York 12201-2007
<BR>

             <B><CENTER>EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</CENTER></B>
<BR>

                            <B><CENTER>EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 6</CENTER></B>
<BR>

     It is the policy of the State of New York that equal opportunity be assured in the State's personnel system and affirmative action provided in its administration, in accordance with the requirements of the State's Human Rights Law and the mandates of Title VII of the Federal Civil Rights Act, as amended.  Accordingly, it is the responsibility of the State's Department of Civil Service to enforce the State's policy of ensuring full and equal opportunity for minorities, women, disabled persons and Vietnam era veterans at all occupational levels of State government.
<BR>
<BR>

     NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws of the State of New York, I, Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows:
<BR>
<BR>

A.   RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION
<BR>
<BR>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>1.   The President of the Civil Service Commission shall issue guidelines for the preparation of annual affirmative action plans and statewide goals and objectives for the employment of minorities, women, disabled persons and Vietnam Era Veterans.  The Department of Civil Service shall also provide the staff work for the development of comprehensive statewide affirmative action policies, goals,  objectives and implementation strategies.
<BR>
<BR>

     2.   The President of the Civil Service Commission, in consultation with the Governor's Executive Committee for Affirmative Action (the  "Executive Committee") established pursuant to Article B of this  Order, shall be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the  written affirmative action plans of State agencies on a continuing  basis, including the need for revising or amending such plans, and           shall provide quarterly reports on progress to the Governor,  incorporating recommendations for improving and strengthening such efforts.

<TITLE>Appendix IX Sexual Orientation</TITLE>

                               <B><CENTER>APPENDIX IX
<BR>
<BR>

                              SEXUAL ORIENTATION
<BR>
<BR>

                            EXECUTIVE ORDER No. 28</CENTER></B>
<BR>

     Ours is a unique government.  It was created and has been preserved by people from all over the world who came here seeking one thing above all others:  freedom--freedom to believe and to act on those beliefs; freedom that says that so long as an individual's conduct and actions remain a matter of personal expression and do not deprive others of their rights, they should be neither restrained nor punished by government.
<BR>
<BR>

     Our nation values freedom so greatly, it has been written into our Constitution.  We all prize that freedom and millions have fought to protect and to extend it.
<BR>
<BR>

     Each generation has come to understand the basic wisdom of our Constitution:  that only by protecting the freedom of others can we ensure it for ourselves; that to encourage or allow government to discriminate against any belief or creed or private way of life would threaten us all.  This is so because we could never be sure which particular value would dominate government at any particular point in time.  Only neutrality by government was deemed safe and that is what our Constitution assures.
<BR>
<BR>

     This freedom makes us strong.  It is essential to our pluralism.  It protects religious believers, and agnostics, and atheists, and political dissenters, and conservatives and liberals, creating a nation and a state where the right to live as conscience dictates is enshrined as law.  Because of such freedom we enjoy a cultural and religious diversity unmatched by any other nation.
<BR>
<BR>

     The freedom our Constitution grants, however, requires that government exercise a degree of tolerance unthinkable in societies less open or diverse than ours.  It demands a tolerance for the privacy of each individual, a refusal to use the state as an instrument of coercion of belief or thought, however desirable the majority regards a particular belief or thought to be.
<BR>
<BR>

     Even when this freedom is unchallenged, it is so precious to us all that our commitment to preserve it from encroachment by government deserves constant reaffirmation and reiteration.  But when this freedom is questioned or when evidence of unfair discrimination exists, then our reaffirmation is not an option--it is a simple necessity.
<BR>
<BR>

     I have seen evidence of such encroachment.  As Secretary of State, I was required to issue special regulations to prohibit discrimination against individuals seeking licenses for certain occupations or corporate privileges.  Up to that time such licenses were denied on the basis of sexual orientation or even presumed sexual orientation.  There is no reason to believe that the discrimination apparent in the part of government was confined there.
<BR>
<BR>

    No one argued then against my change in the State's regulations.  No one was heard to say that government had no place in fighting unfair discrimination.  In fact, in recognition of this, a personnel directive against discrimination in hiring was issued during the prior administration.
<BR>
<BR>

     I suggest, respectfully, that what was right then is right now.  And I believe that there is no justification for the failure to announce freedom from discrimination as the policy, not just of the Department of State but of this entire State government.
<BR>
<BR>

     Indeed, the most persistent argument that has been offered in opposition to my stating the views contained in this Order does not really contradict any of them.  Rather it says, in effect, we ought not to state this constitutional truth because it may be misrepresented to be something else.  Specifically, it is suggested that the argument against discrimination will be distorted into an argument promoting homosexuality.  
<BR>
<BR>

     The argument is beside the mark.  There is no perfect protection against distortion.  Indeed one could as easily argue that silence on this issue could be distorted into an argument promoting discrimination against homosexuals.
<BR>
<BR>

     In this case, this statement and Executive Order are clear.  Their essence is that our government cannot promote any religion, creed, belief or life-style without thereby threatening all others.
<BR>
<BR>

     This is an argument for securing freedom by insisting on neutrality.  It is a proposition that is at the very foundation of our nation's strength.  We ought never be embarrassed nor afraid to repeat it.
<BR>
<BR>

     Accordingly, for all the above reasons, I am this day reiterating the law set down by the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of New York as the policy of this Administration.
<BR>
<BR>

A.   Statement of Policy
<BR>
<BR>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>1.   No state agency or department shall discriminate on the basis of           sexual orientation against any individual in the provision of any services or benefits by such State agency or department.
<BR>
<BR>

     2.   All State agencies and departments shall prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in any matter pertaining to employment by the State including, but not limited to, hiring, job appointment, promotion, tenure, recruitment and compensation.
<BR>
<BR>

     3.   The Office of Employee Relations is hereby directed to promulgate clear and consistent guidelines prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation to maintain an environment where only job-related criteria are used to assess employees or prospective employees of the State.  The Office shall also implement a procedure to ensure the swift and thorough investigation of complaints of discrimination based on sexual orientation.  Particular effort should be made to conduct investigations with due regard for confidentiality.
<BR>
<BR>

    4.   In order to assure that we understand fully the extent and nature of any discrimination that exists, I will appoint a Task Force, including the Commissioners of the Departments of Correctional Services, Health, Mental Health, Labor, Social Services and the Division of Human Rights, the Superintendent of State Police, the President of the Civil Service Commission, the Directors of the Women's Division, the Office of Employee Relations, the Division for Youth and the Office for the Aging, the Chairman of the State Liquor Authority and seven private citizens whom I shall designate.  The Task Force shall submit such reports and recommendations as it sees fit, dealing with individuals' rights to the benefit of government services and opportunity for government service regardless of sexual orientation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

     I shall designate a Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson of the Task Force.  Its members shall receive no compensation, but shall be entitled to reimbursement for any necessary expenses incurred directly in connection with the performance of their duties.

                  GRIEVANCES PROCEDURES FOR STATE EMPLOYEES
<BR>
<BR>

                            EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 42</CENTER></B>
<BR>

     With the advent of collective negotiations between the State and employee organizations pursuant to the Public Employees' Fair Employment Act of 1967, collectively negotiated agreements ("collective agreements") have been entered into which provide for grievance procedures which are intended to supersede in whole or in part the grievance procedures provided for by the Executive Order heretofore issued on August 28, 1963.  Such negotiated grievance procedures are a milestone in the development of collective negotiations in the public sector.  Nevertheless, there is still an important reason for the continuation of procedures for the settlement of grievances of employees who are not covered by collective agreements or for the settlement of non-contract grievances which are outside of the scope of the grievance procedure set forth in any such collective agreement.
<BR>
<BR>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>1.   Every employee to whom this order applies shall have the right to           present his/her grievance in accordance with this order, free from interference, coercion, restraint, discrimination or reprisal.   He/she shall have the right to present his/her grievance individually or with a representative of his/her own choosing at all           steps of the grievance procedure hereunder, except that where there is in effect a collective agreement covering a negotiation unit which includes such employee which was entered into between the State and an employee organization, then such employee may not choose as his/her representative any employee organization other than the employee organization with which such agreement was negotiated nor may any employee organization other than the one with which such agreement was negotiated initiate or process a grievance except to the extent permitted by such agreement.
<BR>
<BR>

     2.   Grievance Appeals Board.  The Grievance Appeals Board established by  the executive order heretofore issued on August 28, 1963 shall be transferred to the Office of Employee Relations.  It shall consist of three members appointed by and who shall serve at the pleasure of the Director of Employee Relations.  No person regularly employed in a full time position in the State service shall be eligible for appointment to the Board.  One member shall be designated by the Director to serve as chairperson of the Board.  The compensation of the members of the Board shall be fixed by the Director with the approval of the Director of the Budget.
<BR>
<BR>

     3.   Departmental Procedures. The head of each State department or agency shall, subject to the approval of the Grievance Appeals Board established pursuant to this order, establish formal procedures for the submission of grievances by employees and for the prompt and orderly consideration and determination of such grievances by supervisors and the department or agency head.
<BR>
<BR>

   4.   Powers and Duties of the Grievance Appeals Board.  The Grievance Appeals Board is hereby charged with the responsibility for and empowered to: </BLOCKQUOTE>

          <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>a)  establish and maintain a program for resolving employee grievances relating to conditions of employment in the State service not inconsistent with the State's obligations as an employer under the Public Employee's Fair Employment Act of 1967 or collective agreements entered into thereunder.
<BR>
<BR>

          b)  promulgate and amend from time to time, with the approval of the  Director of Employee Relations, such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this order and to review and approve grievance procedures established by  departments and agencies pursuant to this order and such regulations, including provisions for reasonable time off without charge to leave credits for grievants, representatives and witnesses.
<BR>
<BR>

          c)  hold hearings, to conduct investigations, to require the attendance of officers and employees of the State as witnesses and to require the production or examination of records, books and papers of State departments or agencies relating to administration of the grievance procedure.
<BR>
<BR>

          d)  render advice and assistance to officers and employees of State  departments and agencies in any matter relating to the establishment or use of the procedures provided for or adopted pursuant to this order or the regulations issued thereunder.
<BR>
<BR>

          e)  report to the Director of Employee Relations for appropriate  action the failure of any department or agency to establish properly or maintain satisfactorily the standards, principles,  determinations and procedures embodied in or authorized by this order.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>5.   Appeals.  An employee within a time limit and upon compliance with the regulations of the Board, may appeal to the Board from a determination made pursuant to this order by the head of his department or agency, or his designated representative, as the case may be.  The Board shall conduct such review of the appeal as it deems appropriate and may require the appearance before it of the appellant and other parties to the grievance; provided, however,  that the appellant shall be entitled upon his/her request to a hearing before the Board or its designee.  If the appeal involves the enforcement of a law, a civil service rule or regulation or a written rule, regulation or order of a department or agency, the findings of fact and the recommendation of the Board shall be transmitted to the departments or agencies involved for appropriate action in accordance with the facts found by the Board.  In all           other cases, the determination of the Board shall contain a statement of the facts and an advisory recommendation to the departments or agencies involved.  Copies of the determination of the Board shall be sent to the employee involved, to his representative and to the Director of Employee Relations.
<BR>
<BR>

     6.   Application</BLOCKQUOTE>

          <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>a)  The provisions of this order shall apply to employees in the executive branch of the State government (1) who are not covered               by a collective agreement between the State and a certified or recognized employee organization or (2) who are covered by a collective agreement which accords such employees the right to continue to process grievances under this order.
<BR>
<BR>

          b)  The provisions of this order and the procedures established hereunder shall be applicable to grievances in any department or agency claiming an act or omission resulting in an injustice to an employee or arising out of conditions which are in whole or in part subject to the control of the head of such department or agency and which involve alleged safety or health hazards, unsatisfactory physical facilities, surroundings, materials or equipment, unfair or discriminatory supervisory and disciplinary practice, unjust treatment by fellow workers, unreasonable assignment of working hours or personal time allowances, unfair or unreasonable work quotas, and all other grievances relating to conditions of employment; provided, however, that this order shall not apply to matters which are reviewable under administrative procedures established by law or under the rule of the State Civil Service Commission, or the rules of other department or agencies having the force and effect of law or rules governing grievances of employees in the professional service of the State University of New York as defined in Section 355-a of the Education Law, or grievance concerning the interpretation, application or claimed violation of a specific               term or provision of a collective agreement between the State and an employee organization.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>7.   Repeal of Previous Order.  The Executive Order heretofore issued on August 28, 1963 is hereby revoked and superseded by this executive order.  Grievances initiated but not finally resolved prior to the effective date of this order may be continued under the terms of the executive order issued on August 28, 1963.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<TITLE>Appendix IX Sexual Orientation</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#ff00ff">

<CENTER><IMG WIDTH=462 HEIGHT=87  SRC="../FACBOOK.GIF"></CENTER><BR>
<BR>

                               <B><CENTER>APPENDIX IX
<BR>
<BR>

                              SEXUAL ORIENTATION
<BR>
<BR>

                            EXECUTIVE ORDER No. 28</CENTER></B>
<BR>

     Ours is a unique government.  It was created and has been preserved by people from all over the world who came here seeking one thing above all others:  freedom--freedom to believe and to act on those beliefs; freedom that says that so long as an individual's conduct and actions remain a matter of personal expression and do not deprive others of their rights, they should be neither restrained nor punished by government.
<BR>
<BR>

     Our nation values freedom so greatly, it has been written into our Constitution.  We all prize that freedom and millions have fought to protect and to extend it.
<BR>
<BR>

     Each generation has come to understand the basic wisdom of our Constitution:  that only by protecting the freedom of others can we ensure it for ourselves; that to encourage or allow government to discriminate against any belief or creed or private way of life would threaten us all.  This is so because we could never be sure which particular value would dominate government at any particular point in time.  Only neutrality by government was deemed safe and that is what our Constitution assures.
<BR>
<BR>

     This freedom makes us strong.  It is essential to our pluralism.  It protects religious believers, and agnostics, and atheists, and political dissenters, and conservatives and liberals, creating a nation and a state where the right to live as conscience dictates is enshrined as law.  Because of such freedom we enjoy a cultural and religious diversity unmatched by any other nation.
<BR>
<BR>

     The freedom our Constitution grants, however, requires that government exercise a degree of tolerance unthinkable in societies less open or diverse than ours.  It demands a tolerance for the privacy of each individual, a refusal to use the state as an instrument of coercion of belief or thought, however desirable the majority regards a particular belief or thought to be.
<BR>
<BR>

     Even when this freedom is unchallenged, it is so precious to us all that our commitment to preserve it from encroachment by government deserves constant reaffirmation and reiteration.  But when this freedom is questioned or when evidence of unfair discrimination exists, then our reaffirmation is not an option--it is a simple necessity.
<BR>
<BR>

     I have seen evidence of such encroachment.  As Secretary of State, I was required to issue special regulations to prohibit discrimination against individuals seeking licenses for certain occupations or corporate privileges.  Up to that time such licenses were denied on the basis of sexual orientation or even presumed sexual orientation.  There is no reason to believe that the discrimination apparent in the part of government was confined there.
<BR>
<BR>

    No one argued then against my change in the State's regulations.  No one was heard to say that government had no place in fighting unfair discrimination.  In fact, in recognition of this, a personnel directive against discrimination in hiring was issued during the prior administration.
<BR>
<BR>

     I suggest, respectfully, that what was right then is right now.  And I believe that there is no justification for the failure to announce freedom from discrimination as the policy, not just of the Department of State but of this entire State government.
<BR>
<BR>

     Indeed, the most persistent argument that has been offered in opposition to my stating the views contained in this Order does not really contradict any of them.  Rather it says, in effect, we ought not to state this constitutional truth because it may be misrepresented to be something else.  Specifically, it is suggested that the argument against discrimination will be distorted into an argument promoting homosexuality.  
<BR>
<BR>

     The argument is beside the mark.  There is no perfect protection against distortion.  Indeed one could as easily argue that silence on this issue could be distorted into an argument promoting discrimination against homosexuals.
<BR>
<BR>

     In this case, this statement and Executive Order are clear.  Their essence is that our government cannot promote any religion, creed, belief or life-style without thereby threatening all others.
<BR>
<BR>

     This is an argument for securing freedom by insisting on neutrality.  It is a proposition that is at the very foundation of our nation's strength.  We ought never be embarrassed nor afraid to repeat it.
<BR>
<BR>

     Accordingly, for all the above reasons, I am this day reiterating the law set down by the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of New York as the policy of this Administration.
<BR>
<BR>

A.   Statement of Policy
<BR>
<BR>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>1.   No state agency or department shall discriminate on the basis of           sexual orientation against any individual in the provision of any services or benefits by such State agency or department.
<BR>
<BR>

     2.   All State agencies and departments shall prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in any matter pertaining to employment by the State including, but not limited to, hiring, job appointment, promotion, tenure, recruitment and compensation.
<BR>
<BR>

     3.   The Office of Employee Relations is hereby directed to promulgate clear and consistent guidelines prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation to maintain an environment where only job-related criteria are used to assess employees or prospective employees of the State.  The Office shall also implement a procedure to ensure the swift and thorough investigation of complaints of discrimination based on sexual orientation.  Particular effort should be made to conduct investigations with due regard for confidentiality.
<BR>
<BR>

    4.   In order to assure that we understand fully the extent and nature of any discrimination that exists, I will appoint a Task Force, including the Commissioners of the Departments of Correctional Services, Health, Mental Health, Labor, Social Services and the Division of Human Rights, the Superintendent of State Police, the President of the Civil Service Commission, the Directors of the Women's Division, the Office of Employee Relations, the Division for Youth and the Office for the Aging, the Chairman of the State Liquor Authority and seven private citizens whom I shall designate.  The Task Force shall submit such reports and recommendations as it sees fit, dealing with individuals' rights to the benefit of government services and opportunity for government service regardless of sexual orientation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

     I shall designate a Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson of the Task Force.  Its members shall receive no compensation, but shall be entitled to reimbursement for any necessary expenses incurred directly in connection with the performance of their duties.

                   <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>GIVEN under my hand and the Privy Seal of the State  in the City of New York this 18th day of November in the year one thousand nine hundred eighty-three.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

                         /s/Michael J. Del Guidice<BR>

<BR>

	<BLOCKQUOTE><I><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="12A49">49</A>.	RESPONDING TO QUESTIONNAIRES AND REQUESTS FOR CAMPUS DATA</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

		<BLOCKQUOTE>The Office of Institutional Research is responsible for the coordination of data on this campus.  A part of this responsibility includes overseeing of official responses to requests for data from off-campus individuals and agencies.  
<BR><BR>

The Office of Institutional Research should be informed of all requests for data from such sources.  These requests arrive with considerable frequency, and many ask for similar information.  Coordination of replies is necessary to insure that correct information is being disseminated.  Also, it is important for this office to know the nature, range and variety of information being sought from our College.  Therefore, copies of responses to requests that might not require official information (e.g. questionnaires that ask for personal opinion on professional problems) should also be sent to the Office of Institutional Research for its records.  Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated.  It will insure improved flow of accurate information both on and off the campus.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE><I><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="12A50">50</A>.	SAFETY GUIDELINES</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

		<BLOCKQUOTE>New York State's Public Employees <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="OSHA">Occupational Safety and
Health Act</A> provides that the same safety and health standards that apply to workers in the private sector apply to employees in the public sector.  SUNY complies with these safety and health standards by furnishing its employees with a job and workplace free from recognized hazards and by providing responsible and adequate protection to the lives and safety of its staff.
<BR>
<BR>

No one in the University is required to work under conditions that are manifestly dangerous. Some less obvious but still hazardous conditions may exist, so always be sure:
<BR>
<BR>

-	That appliances which protrude from walls and doors, such as pencil sharpeners, are not positioned where people may be injured by them;
<BR>
<BR>

-That wastebaskets, electric cords, telephone, and similar objects are not located where people may trip over them;
<BR>
<BR>

-That safety procedures for laboratories are understood and followed;
<BR>
<BR>
		-	That you hold on to the handrails when using stairs;
<BR>
<BR>

		-	That you remain at a safe distance from the elevator doors;
<BR>
<BR>

		-	That the drawers of filing cabinets and desks are kept closed when not in use;
<BR>
<BR>

		-	That the upper drawers of filing cabinets are not filled to capacity while lower drawers are empty, thereby creating the possibility of the cabinets tipping over; and
<BR>
<BR>

		-	That burning cigarettes or matches are not thrown into the wastebaskets.
<BR>
<BR>

		Use common sense at all times and report any hazardous conditions to your supervisor.  You should consult with your supervisor concerning evacuation procedures and other emergency situations.

	<I><BLOCKQUOTE><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="12A51">51</A>.	SCIENTIFIC MISCONDUCT</BLOCKQUOTE></I>

		<BLOCKQUOTE>A crucial element of any policy on scientific misconduct that is to be fair and effective is a process that will distinguish instances of genuine and serious misconduct from insignificant deviations from acceptable practices, technical violations of rules, simple carelessness, and other such minor infractions.  The policy proposed in this document will allow such distinctions to be made in a manner that minimizes disruptiveness and protects the conscientious, honest scientist from false or mistaken accusations.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>a)	Policy Statement</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>


	<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>It is the purpose of these policies to instill and promote the principles of professional integrity, to prevent scientific misconduct, and to discover and censure instances of misconduct when they occur.  Accordingly,</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>


			<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>i)	SUNY Potsdam shall maintain high ethical standards in science and other scholarly work, prevent misconduct where possible, and promptly and fairly evaluate and resolve instances of alleged or apparent misconduct.
<BR>
<BR>


			ii)	Every member of the College community has the responsibility of reporting misconduct in scientific work.  No person raising serious allegations of misconduct will suffer any penalty; however, frivolous, mischievous or malicious misrepresentation in alleging misconduct will not be tolerated and may result in action against the perpetrator.
<BR>
<BR>


			iii)	SUNY Potsdam shall take appropriate disciplinary action against any individual found guilty of misconduct.  This will include disclosure to funding agencies, collaborating scientists and institutions, journal editors, professional associations, licensing boards, and potential employers who request oral or written references.
<BR>
<BR>

			iv)	These policies apply to scientific research and related scholarly writing conducted by any member of the University faculty or staff.  They are not intended to address issues, such as the conduct of students in fulfilling course requirements, which are covered by other policies.
<BR>
<BR>

			v)	These procedures for the institutional handling of allegations of scientific misconduct normally have four stages:</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>(a)an inquiry to determine whether the allegation or related issues warrant further investigation;
<BR>
<BR>
				(b)	when warranted, an investigation to collect and thoroughly examine evidence;
<BR>
<BR>
			(c)	a formal finding, and
<BR>
<BR>
				(d)	appropriate disposition of the matter.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

			<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>vi)	As a general rule, the College will take no more than 60 days to conduct its inquiry and determine whether an investigation is warranted.  If an investigation is to be undertaken, it will begin within 30 days of the conclusion of the inquiry, and the institution shall generally take no more than 120 days to complete the investigation, prepare the report of findings, obtain the comments of the subject(s) of the investigation, and make a decision on the disposition of the case.
<BR>
<BR>
			vii)	The College will annually report to all funding and sponsoring agencies as follows:</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>(a)	Assurance that the institution has established an administrative process for reviewing, investigating, and reporting allegations of misconduct in science in connection with sponsored research.

		<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>e)	Inquiry and Investigation of Allegations</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>


			<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>i)	Inquiry</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>


				<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>(a)	As a first step in the process of inquiry an initial report of alleged misconduct will be prepared in writing by the Misconduct Policy Officer.  The accuracy of this report must be attested to by a statement signed by the person(s) originating the report.  The Misconduct Policy Officer will then conduct an immediate, informal, discrete inquiry into allegations of misconduct in order to determine  whether there is a substantial basis for initiating a formal investigation into the alleged misconduct.  The Misconduct Policy Officer will make every effort to safeguard all individual reputations and the integrity of the research.  Every effort shall be made to protect the interests and privacy of those who in good faith report apparent misconduct and others who testify.  In the conduct of this Inquiry, the Misconduct Policy Officer may consult, on an ad hoc basis, with faculty members of his/her choice.
<BR>
<BR>

				(b)	The faculty member or other investigator whose research is the subject of the complaint shall be notified that a complaint has been lodged, the nature of the complaint, and the procedures to be followed.  The affected individual(s) will be granted confidential treatment to the maximum extent possible, a prompt and thorough investigation, and an opportunity to comment on allegations and findings of the inquiry and/or the investigation.
<BR>
<BR>

				(c)	Any evidence pertinent to the resolution of the issue shall be made secure by the Misconduct Policy Officer conducting the inquiry.
<BR>
<BR>

				(d)The inquiry shall be conducted in confidence with the purpose of separating unfounded allegation(s) from those of a substantive nature and shall be completed whenever possible within 60 days of the initial receipt of the allegations.  At the completion of the inquiry, a written report shall be filed with the Provost with an assessment as to whether or not the allegation(s) is warranted, and the reasons attendant thereto.  The Misconduct Policy Officer will maintain sufficiently detailed documentation of inquiries to permit a later assessment of the reasons for determining that an investigation was not warranted, if necessary.  Such records shall be maintained in a secure manner for a period of at least three years after the termination of the inquiry and shall, upon request, be provided to authorized representatives of sponsoring and funding agencies.
<BR>
<BR>

				(e)	Precautions should be taken against real or apparent conflicts of interest on the part of those involved in the inquiry or investigation.
<BR>
<BR>

				(f)	The Provost shall determine on the basis of the written report of the inquiry, and any other consultation deemed necessary, whether the allegations warrant a formal investigation.  In 					either case, the basis for the decision will be fully documented.
<BR>
<BR>

				(g)	If the decision of the Provost is that no investigation is warranted, the Provost will notify all those concerned of this determination.  The Provost may also examine the propriety of the initial charge and take further action if appropriate.
<BR>
<BR>

				(h)	If the decision of the Provost is that an investigation is necessary, it shall be formally undertaken within 30 days of the completion of the inquiry.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

			<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>ii)	Submit a copy of the report to the accused for rebuttal.
<BR>
<BR>

			iii)	Include any written rebuttal by the accused as an addendum to the report.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


		<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>h)	If an investigation has been launched on the basis of a complaint, and no fraud or misconduct is found, no disciplinary measures should be taken against the complainant and the institution should undertake diligent efforts, as appropriate, to restore the reputation of persons alleged to have engaged in misconduct.  It will also undertake diligent efforts to protect the positions and reputations of those persons who, in good faith, make allegations.  If the allegations are found to have been maliciously motivated, disciplinary actions may be taken against those responsible.
<BR>
<BR>

Responsibility for recommending the nature and severity of disciplinary action will rest in the Provost.  If misconduct is confirmed, the Provost shall make recommendations to the President for appropriate sanctions against the subject.
<BR>
<BR>

The President, upon receiving the report of the Provost and any statement of rebuttal by the accused, will make a final determination regarding what action shall be taken and formally notify all parties, including the awarding agency and Research Foundation of that decision.
<BR>
<BR>

If misconduct is confirmed, the institution will take appropriate action in accordance with Article 19 of the Agreement between the State of New York and United University Professions.  A faculty/staff member who is the subject of an inquiry or investigation has, as a matter of course, the right to consultation with legal counsel if he or she chooses.  However, the faculty  member has the right to representation by counsel in institutional proceedings only after formal disciplinary charges have been filed in accordance with Section 19.8 of the Agreement between the State of New York and the United University Professions.
<BR>
<BR>

Consideration will also be given to formal notification of other concerned parties, not previously notified, such as:
<BR>
<BR>

	_	Sponsoring agencies, funding sources.<BR>

_	Co-authors, co-investigators, collaborators.<BR>

_	Editors of journals in which fraudulent research was                     published.<BR>

				_	Editors of journals or other publications, other      institutions, sponsoring agencies, and funding sources with which the individual has been affiliated.<BR>

				_	Professional societies.<BR>

				_	Where appropriate, criminal authorities.
<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="12A"><b>A</a>.	CAMPUS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</b>

<dt><br>
	<BLOCKQUOTE><dt><A NAME="12A64">64</A>.<i>	WORK ORDER REQUESTS</i>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
	<dt><A NAME="12A64a">a</A>)	Maintenance of Campus Physical Facilities
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	Scope
<dt><br>
				<dt>Maintenance of campus physical facilities is the responsibility of the Physical Plant Department.  Work done by the department may be classified as either routine or non-routine.
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 4 -->
<dt>(a)	Routine Work
<dt><br>
	<dt>The primary function of the Physical Plant Department is the routine maintenance and operation of campus physical facilities.  This function is defined as upkeep, repair, replacement and preventative maintenance of buildings, systems, components and non-academic equipment as originally configured, installed and operated.  Routine maintenance and operation work is given priority.  This is necessary because facility malfunctions tend to affect the campus community as a whole, rather than one or a few individuals.  The cost of routine maintenance is the responsibility of the Physical Plant Department and is paid from the department's operating budget.
<dt><br>
<dt>(b)	Non-Routine Work
<dt><br>
<dt>Non-routine work is considered any job that is not maintenance and operation oriented, such as requests for partitions, shelves, space alterations, utility enlargements, academic equipment construction and/or repair.  The cost of non-routine work is not a part of the Physical Plant Department's operating budget.  The funding source will have to be identified and the project may require approval of the Building Administrator, Department Chairperson/Director, Dean, Provost and/or President.
</dl><!-- 4 -->
<dt><br>
			<dt>ii)	Procedures
<dt><br>
				<dt>A request to have work (routine or non-routine) performed is processed using a Work Request form.  This form is available from the Office of Physical Plant.
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 4 -->
<dt>(a)	Three copies of the completed work request form (including Department Chairperson/Director and Building Administrator approval) is submitted to the Physical Plant Office.  One copy (pink) is retained for department files.
<dt><br>
<dt>(b)	Physical Plant personnel will review the work request to determine the feasibility of the request, as well as the capability of the Physical Plant Department to complete the project, and budget and personnel requirements.
<dt><br>
				<dt>(c)	For non-routine work, the Physical Plant Office will estimate the project cost, recommend a funding source(s) (e.g. department budget, campus OTPS pool, capital construction), and discuss with the requester before proceeding.  Where the funding source identified is the campus OTPS pool, it is the requester's responsibility to request the funds.  If capital construction funds are required, the Assistant Vice President for Facilities is responsible for submitting the request as required after approval by the President (or designee).
<dt><br>
<dt>(d)Authorized work requests will be assigned to the appropriate supervisor for action.  The requester will be notified that this has been done.  Unauthorized requests are returned to the requester with explanation.
<dt><br>
<dt>(e)A monthly status review of Work Requests will be completed by the Physical Plant Office.  Incomplete work orders will be discussed with appropriate supervisor and analyzed for resolution.
<dt><br>
				<dt>(f)	The requester may, at any time, ask for a status report pertaining to his/her work order by contacting the Physical Plant Office personnel.
<dt><br>
				<dt>It is to be noted that because of the large number of work orders submitted it may not always be possible to complete requests within time limits desired due to available personnel, funding requirements, the availability of materials and other commitments.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<BLOCKQUOTE><dt><A NAME="12A64b">b</A>)	SUNY Potsdam Telecommunications Network
<dt><br>
			<dt>The SUNY Potsdam Telecommunications Network supports voice, video and data services.  Voice services are provided through a cable plant of twisted-pair wiring connecting each campus telephone set (digital and analog) to a campus AT&T switch.  Voice services include AUDIX voice mail and auto-attendant features.    
<dt><br>
<dt>Video (TV) services are provided via coaxial cable from a campus-managed SMATV distribution system.  Programming consists of 22 channels of television and a campus information channel and is delivered to every student room and many classrooms.   
<dt><br>
<dt>Data services are provided by standard Ethernet networking via fiber and thinwire cable to nearly every office, classroom, computer center and laboratory on campus.  Data communication protocols currently supported include AppleTalk, DECnet, LAT, Novell IPX, TCP/IP.  Remote access to the data network supporting ARA, SLIP, PPP and standard RS232 is provided via a bank of 1200/2400/9600/14000 modems.
<dt><br>
<dt>Services relating to the SUNY Potsdam Telecommunications Network (repair, maintenance or installation) must be requested from the Distributed Computing/TeleMedia department on a Network Add/Change/Repair form.  Forms are available from the telephone office of Distributed Computing/TeleMedia in Kellas Hall (x3000).  The form must not only include a description of the work to be performed, but also an account for billing if parts and materials must be purchased.  If assistance from the Physical Plant is needed, that office will be notified using the standard Physical Plant work-request form.  Usually, requests will be handled on a first-come, first-served basis.  Exceptions will be made for emergency requests if they are within reason.

		<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A64c">c</A>)	Audio-Visual/Electronic Repairs
<dt><br>
			<dt>All repairs of departmentally-managed audio-visual or elec- tronic equipment are to be requested by memorandum to the Director of Distributed Computing/TeleMedia.  If the repairs require an extraordinary expensive part or component, the department may be asked to find funding to share in the cost.  When necessary, and if available, temporary replacement will be supplied.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<dt><br>
          <Dt>Tier III members are entitled to receive either the benefits under the Coordinated Escalator Plan (CO-ESC) or the benefits under the Coordinated Retirement Plan.  Members may not mix the provisions of  the two laws to change the eligibility requirements for a benefit under either plan.  Once a Tier III member selects and begins to receive a retirement benefit, whether it be under CO-ESC or the Coordinated Retirement Plan, (s)he cannot change plans.  For example, if a Tier III member retires at age 55 under the provisions of the CO-ESC Plan with its 30% reduction and its offset of Social Security beginning at age 62, the member is "locked in" to that benefit--(s)he cannot change to Coordinated Retirement Plan benefits at a later date.  (See below for further discussion of these benefits.
<dt><br>
          <dt>Tier IV members are only entitled to the benefits of the Coordinated Retirement Plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6C7a"><BLOCKQUOTE>a</A>)  Final Average Salary
<dt><br>
              <dt>Your final average salary is the average of the wages you earned during the 36 consecutive months which will provide the highest average wage.  If the wages earned during any year included in the 3-year period exceed the average wages of the previous 2 years by more than 10%, the amount over 10% will be excluded from the calculation.  If the 3-year period used immediately precedes retirement, any month or months (up to 12), during which you are on authorized leave of absence at partial or no pay, shall be excluded and an equal number of months immediately preceding the period shall be substituted.

          </dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6C7b">b</A>)  Service Credit
<dt><br>
              <dt>Service credit is based on time worked including paid vacation and sick leave.  Your annual statement shows the credit you have earned in a year.

          </dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6C7c">c)  Service Retirement Eligibility
<dt><br>
              <dt>You are eligible for a normal service retirement benefit when you are 62 years of age or older, and have 10 or more years of creditable service after July 1, 1973.  If you are age 70 or older when you cease public service, the minimum service requirement is reduced to 5 years.

          </dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6C7d">d</A>)  Early Service Retirement Benefits
<dt><br>
              <dt>As a Tier III member, your normal retirement allowance is based on age 62.  Should you choose to retire between the ages of 55 and 62, your retirement benefit will be calculated as follows:
<dt><br>
              <dt>If you retire with 20 or more years of service credit, your normal service retirement benefit will equal 1/50th (2%) of your final average salary multiplied by your years of credited service (not to exceed 30 years). 
<dt><br>
              <dt>If you retire with fewer than 20 years of service, your normal service retirement benefit will equal 1/60th (1.66%) of your final average salary multiplied by your total years of service credit.
<dt><br>
              <dt>Your retirement benefit will be calculated without the CO-ESC Social Security deduction.  It will, however, be reduced by 1/15th (6.66%) for each of the first two years by which your retirement precedes age 62 and 1/30th (3.33%) for each year by which your retirement precedes age 60.  At age 62, your benefit will be further reduced by 50% of the CO-ESC Social Security retirement benefit.

          </dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6C7e">e)  Options
<Dt><br>
              <dt>In addition to a maximum retirement benefit, with no provision for a beneficiary, there are several options available which provide protection for a beneficiary.  The decision of an option must be made no later than the day before the effective date of retirement.

<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6C7f">f</A>)  Vesting
<dt><br>
              <dt>If you have 10 or more years of credited service and leave public employment, you have the right to a vested benefit.  This will entitle you to a retirement benefit when you attain age 62,  regardless of the fact that you have left public employment.
<dt><br>
              <dt>If you wish, you may elect to receive a reduced benefit at any time between age 55 and age 62.
<dt><br>
              <Dt>The vested retirement allowance is calculated in the same way as the service retirement benefit.  There is a guarantee, however, that the benefit cannot be less than the actuarial equivalent of your contributions with interest.
<Dt><br>
              <dt>Remember, vested benefits are not paid automatically.  It is up to you to notify the system when you become eligible for and ready to receive your benefit.
<Dt><br>
              <dt>In order to receive vested benefits at the earliest possible time, you should submit an application between 30 and 90 days before you reach age 62.  Similarly, to apply for the reduced vested benefit, an application can be filed as early as 30 to 90 days before you become age 55.

<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6C7gi"><BLOCKQUOTE>i</A>)   Ordinary Disability Benefits
<dt><br>
                   <dt>If you are credited with a least five years of service and are not eligible for a normal retirement benefit but are eligible for a primary Social Security disability benefit, you may be eligible for an ordinary disability benefit from the Retirement System.
<Dt><br>
                   <Dt>Disability retirement benefits qualify for the annual increases/decreases as of the month in which your disability retirement becomes effective.  The adjustment is in the amount of 3% or the change in the cost of living index, whichever is lesser.
<Dt><br>
                   <Dt>Your ordinary disability retirement benefit is equal to the greater of:
<dt><br>
                  <dd>- 33 1/3% of your final average salary; or
<dt><br>
                   <dd>- 2% of your final average salary for each year of  service credit up to 30 years.
<dt><br>
                   <dt>In either case, this benefit is reduced by 50% of the Social Security disability benefit.  If a Workers' Compensation benefit is payable, the Ordinary Disability benefit is reduced by the amount of such benefits for as long as they are paid.

<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6C7gii">ii</A>)   Accidental Disability Benefits
<dt><br>
                   <dt>If you become disabled as the natural and proximate result of an accident on the job, not caused by your own willful negligence, and you are not eligible for a normal service retirement benefit but are eligible for primary Social Security disability benefits, you may be eligible for an accidental disability benefit from the Retirement System.
<dt><br>
                   <dt>If approved, your accidental disability retirement benefit will be equal to 2% of your final average salary for each year of service credit you would have earned if you had been able to work until you reached 65 (not to exceed 30 years).  This benefit is then reduced by 50% of the Social Security disability benefit.  If a Workers' Compensation benefit is payable, the disability benefit is reduced by the amount of such benefits as long as they are paid.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<dt><br>
              <dt>CO-ESC members must contribute 3% of their annual salary toward their retirement benefits during the period for which they accrue service credit.  Employers also contribute to the Retirement System on behalf of members.  These two sources together with investment income provide the money to pay retirement benefits.

<dt><br>
              <dt>If you leave public employment and are neither vested nor  eligible for a benefit, you may withdraw all your accumulated contributions plus interest.  If you later return to public employment, after having withdrawn your contributions, you will not receive credit for  your earlier service unless you apply for that credit, repay the withdrawn contributions and interest and complete five years of creditable service.

<dt><br>
              <dt>If you think you are eligible, you or the Office of Human Resources may file an application for a disability benefit.  The application must be filed within three months of the last date you were paid on the payroll.  In the case of a medical leave of absence without pay, the application may be submitted within 12 months of your last paid service, provided you were disabled when the leave began and are on the leave when the application is filed.
<dt><br>
              <dt>Ten years of credited service are required in order to qualify for a disability benefit.  If your disability results from an on-the-job accident, not due to your own negligence, there is no minimum service requirement.  In order to qualify for your disability benefit, written notice of your accident must be filed with the Retirement System within 90 days of the accident, detailing the time and place of the incident, the particulars thereof, the nature and extent of your injuries, and your alleged incapacity.  The notice must be signed by your or someone acting on your behalf.

<B><CENTER>NEW YORK STATE ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT ACT</CENTER></B>
<BR>

NEW YORK STATE ETHICS COMMISSION RULES
<BR>
<BR>

A.	OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES
<BR>
<BR>

	Applicability
<BR>
<BR>

	The limitations on outside activities apply to State policy-makers only.  Within the University, policy-makers generally are considered to be those employees at the level of Dean and above at the campuses and Associate Vice Chancellor and above in the System Administration.
<BR>
<BR>

General Requirements
<BR>
<BR>

All policy-makers are prohibited from serving as an officer of a political party or political organization or as a member of a national committee of a political party.
<BR>
<BR>

The regulations further require that salaried policy-makers obtain the prior approval of the Campus President and the Ethics Commission before;

	<BLOCKQUOTE>-	holding other public office or engaging in other public employment for more than nominal compensation (defined as:  greater than the normal per diem or $4000 annually);
<BR>
<BR>

	-	engaging in any private employment, business or other activity (including not-for-profit) for more than the defined nominal compensation; and
<BR>
<BR>

	-	serving as director or officer of a for-profit corporation or institution, regardless of compensation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	Prior approval of limited to the Campus President is required when salaried policy-makers engage in private employment or other activity for annual compensation between $1000 and $4000.
<BR>
<BR>

Approval of any request to engage in outside activities must be based upon consistency of the activity with the ethical standards in sections 73 and 74 of the Public Officers Law booklet and a determination that the activity does not interfere or conflict with the proper and effective discharge of the employee's SUNY responsibilities (see also Policies of the Board of Trustees, Article XI, Title H, 4 (8 NYCRR 355.26)). 
<BR>
<BR>

Procedures for Requesting Approval

<BLOCKQUOTE>1.	Where both University and Commission approvals are required, requests are to be made on forms provided by the Ethics Commission.
<BR>
<BR>

	2.	At the campuses, request forms should be submitted first by affected employees to the President.  Requests for approval of outside activities involving a President should be submitted to the Executive Vice Chancellor.  Those requests approved on campus should be transmitted directly to the Ethics Commission for approval, with a copy to the Executive Vice Chancellor.  Approved requests of a President will be submitted to the Ethics Commission by the Executive Vice Chancellor.
<BR>
<BR>

	3.	Where approval of the University alone is required by the regulations (i.e., request involving annual compensation from a private business of between $1000 and $4000), the official form can be modified or approval may be requested on a letter submitted by the employee.  The same procedures as above should be followed except that no further approvals beyond the appropriate President is required.</BLOCKQUOTE>

B.	HONORARIA AND TRAVEL
<BR>
<BR>

	The regulations on receipt of honoraria and travel reimbursement apply to all compensated State employees, with the exception of academic employees in SUNY and CUNY engaging in activities within their academic discipline.
  <BR>
<BR>
   
	Honoraria
<BR>
<BR>

Under the regulations, an honorarium is defined as a "payment, fee, or other compensation made as a gratuity or as an award or honor" for services rendered by a covered employee not related to the covered employee's official duties.  It also includes a payment for travel expenses incurred by the employee in the course of services unrelated to the employee's duties.  The regulations set forth specific conditions under which honoraria may be expected.
<BR>
<BR>

Obtaining prior approval of requests to receive honoraria is optional rather than mandatory.  Requests, if made, are subject only to University action and the filing of the determination with the Ethics Commission.  Employees receiving honoraria without prior approval of the University, however, are required to report annually (April 1) to their campus or System Administration, as appropriate, the source, date, amount, and nature of the activities for which honoraria were received in the previous year.  In turn, a compilation of individual reports must be filed with the Ethics Commission on an annual basis (June 1).  Employees who have obtained prior approval from the University of requests to receive honoraria need not file these annual reports.  No special form for submission of the request for prior approval or the annual report has been specified.
<BR>
<BR>

Requests for prior approval of honoraria or annual reports regarding honoraria should be submitted by affected employees to the President or the President's designee.  Requests or reports involving a President should be submitted to the Executive Chancellor.  The campus designee or Executive Vice Chancellor, as appropriate, will be responsible for filing approved advance requests for receipt of honoraria and annual reports with the Ethics Commission.	<BR>
<BR>
Travel Expense Reimbursement
<BR>
<BR>

	Advance approval by the campus is required for receipt of travel expense reimbursement related to an employee's official duties.  The same process described for advance approval of honoraria should be utilized for approval of travel reimbursement that complies with the criteria contained in the regulations.  No filing with the Ethics Commission are required.
<BR>
<BR>

Any honorarium or travel reimbursement received which is over $1000 must also be reported on an employee's annual financial disclosure statement, where filing of that form is required.
<BR>
<BR>

Any questions relating to the compliance with these regulations may be directed to the Office of University Counsel at (518) 443-5400.
<BR>

One filing will suffice.

 <B><CENTER>APPENDIX VII</CENTER></B>
<BR>

             <B><CENTER>EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</CENTER></B>
<BR>

                            <B><CENTER>EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 6</CENTER></B>
<BR>

     It is the policy of the State of New York that equal opportunity be assured in the State's personnel system and affirmative action provided in its administration, in accordance with the requirements of the State's Human Rights Law and the mandates of Title VII of the Federal Civil Rights Act, as amended.  Accordingly, it is the responsibility of the State's Department of Civil Service to enforce the State's policy of ensuring full and equal opportunity for minorities, women, disabled persons and Vietnam era veterans at all occupational levels of State government.
<BR>
<BR>

     NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws of the State of New York, I, Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows:
<BR>
<BR>

A.   RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION
<BR>
<BR>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>1.   The President of the Civil Service Commission shall issue guidelines for the preparation of annual affirmative action plans and statewide goals and objectives for the employment of minorities, women, disabled persons and Vietnam Era Veterans.

<BR>
<BR>

     2.   The President of the Civil Service Commission, in consultation with the Governor's Executive Committee for Affirmative Action (the  "Executive Committee") established pursuant to Article B of this  Order, shall be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the  written affirmative action plans of State agencies on a continuing  basis, including the need for revising or amending such plans, and           shall provide quarterly reports on progress to the Governor,  incorporating recommendations for improving and strengthening such efforts.
<BR>
<BR>

     3.   Upon finding by the President of the Civil Service Commission of  substantial non-compliance by a State agency or department with the  requirements or terms of this Order, the President of the Civil Service Commission shall notify the agency or department of such finding and propose a remedial plan of action.  The agency or           department shall have thirty days from the receipt of such notice to accept the remedial plan or submit an alternative remedial plan acceptable to the President.  Should the agency or department fail to act within such period, the President of the Civil Service Commission is authorized to assume responsibility for the implementation of the plan until (s)he is satisfied that the agency or department will implement the plan in compliance with the provisions of this Order.
<BR>
<BR>

          The President of the Civil Service Commission shall prepare annually a report of the composition of the work force of each State agency and department by sex and ethnic identity for all job categories, salary grades and civil service classifications.  The President of the Civil Service Commission shall also conduct studies to identify           and resolve problems in eliminating underrepresentation and underutilization of minorities, women, disabled persons and Vietnam Era Veterans and shall amend or repeal such rule and regulations within the scope of his/her authority which may adversely affect employment opportunities of minorities, women, disabled persons and Vietnam Era Veterans and shall make recommendations to the Governor and the Executive Committee concerning the adoption or amendment of other laws, rules and regulations for the same purpose.
<BR>
<BR>
     
     4.   The President of the Civil Service Commission, in consultation with the Executive Committee, shall review existing and proposed procedures for the abolition of positions and reduction of the State's workforce and make recommendations designed to minimize the effect of such procedures on women, minorities, disabled persons and Vietnam Era Veterans.</BLOCKQUOTE>

B.   RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
      <BR>

<TITLE>Appendix IX Sexual Orientation</TITLE>

                               <B><CENTER>APPENDIX IX
<BR>
<BR>

                              SEXUAL ORIENTATION
<BR>
<BR>

                            EXECUTIVE ORDER No. 28</CENTER></B>
<BR>

     Ours is a unique government.  It was created and has been preserved by people from all over the world who came here seeking one thing above all others:  freedom--freedom to believe and to act on those beliefs; freedom that says that so long as an individual's conduct and actions remain a matter of personal expression and do not deprive others of their rights, they should be neither restrained nor punished by government.
<BR>
<BR>

     Our nation values freedom so greatly, it has been written into our Constitution.  We all prize that freedom and millions have fought to protect and to extend it.
<BR>
<BR>

     Each generation has come to understand the basic wisdom of our Constitution:  that only by protecting the freedom of others can we ensure it for ourselves; that to encourage or allow government to discriminate against any belief or creed or private way of life would threaten us all.  This is so because we could never be sure which particular value would dominate government at any particular point in time.  Only neutrality by government was deemed safe and that is what our Constitution assures.
<BR>
<BR>

     This freedom makes us strong.  It is essential to our pluralism.  It protects religious believers, and agnostics, and atheists, and political dissenters, and conservatives and liberals, creating a nation and a state where the right to live as conscience dictates is enshrined as law.  Because of such freedom we enjoy a cultural and religious diversity unmatched by any other nation.
<BR>
<BR>

     The freedom our Constitution grants, however, requires that government exercise a degree of tolerance unthinkable in societies less open or diverse than ours.  It demands a tolerance for the privacy of each individual, a refusal to use the state as an instrument of coercion of belief or thought, however desirable the majority regards a particular belief or thought to be.
<BR>
<BR>

     Even when this freedom is unchallenged, it is so precious to us all that our commitment to preserve it from encroachment by government deserves constant reaffirmation and reiteration.  But when this freedom is questioned or when evidence of unfair discrimination exists, then our reaffirmation is not an option--it is a simple necessity.
<BR>
<BR>

     I have seen evidence of such encroachment.  As Secretary of State, I was required to issue special regulations to prohibit discrimination against individuals seeking licenses for certain occupations or corporate privileges.  Up to that time such licenses were denied on the basis of sexual orientation or even presumed sexual orientation.  There is no reason to believe that the discrimination apparent in the part of government was confined there.
<BR>
<BR>

    No one argued then against my change in the State's regulations.  No one was heard to say that government had no place in fighting unfair discrimination.  In fact, in recognition of this, a personnel directive against discrimination in hiring was issued during the prior administration.
<BR>
<BR>

     I suggest, respectfully, that what was right then is right now.  And I believe that there is no justification for the failure to announce freedom from discrimination as the policy, not just of the Department of State but of this entire State government.
<BR>
<BR>

     Indeed, the most persistent argument that has been offered in opposition to my stating the views contained in this Order does not really contradict any of them.  Rather it says, in effect, we ought not to state this constitutional truth because it may be misrepresented to be something else.  Specifically, it is suggested that the argument against discrimination will be distorted into an argument promoting homosexuality.  
<BR>
<BR>

     The argument is beside the mark.  There is no perfect protection against distortion.  Indeed one could as easily argue that silence on this issue could be distorted into an argument promoting discrimination against homosexuals.
<BR>
<BR>

     In this case, this statement and Executive Order are clear.  Their essence is that our government cannot promote any religion, creed, belief or life-style without thereby threatening all others.
<BR>
<BR>

     This is an argument for securing freedom by insisting on neutrality.  It is a proposition that is at the very foundation of our nation's strength.  We ought never be embarrassed nor afraid to repeat it.
<BR>
<BR>

     Accordingly, for all the above reasons, I am this day reiterating the law set down by the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of New York as the policy of this Administration.
<BR>
<BR>

A.   Statement of Policy
<BR>
<BR>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>1.   No state agency or department shall discriminate on the basis of           sexual orientation against any individual in the provision of any services or benefits by such State agency or department.
<BR>
<BR>

     2.   All State agencies and departments shall prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in any matter pertaining to employment by the State including, but not limited to, hiring, job appointment, promotion, tenure, recruitment and compensation.
<BR>
<BR>

     3.   The Office of Employee Relations is hereby directed to promulgate clear and consistent guidelines prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation to maintain an environment where only job-related criteria are used to assess employees or prospective employees of the State.  The Office shall also implement a procedure to ensure the swift and thorough investigation of complaints of discrimination based on sexual orientation.  Particular effort should be made to conduct investigations with due regard for confidentiality.
<BR>
<BR>

    4.   In order to assure that we understand fully the extent and nature of any discrimination that exists, I will appoint a Task Force, including the Commissioners of the Departments of Correctional Services, Health, Mental Health, Labor, Social Services and the Division of Human Rights, the Superintendent of State Police, the President of the Civil Service Commission, the Directors of the Women's Division, the Office of Employee Relations, the Division for Youth and the Office for the Aging, the Chairman of the State Liquor Authority and seven private citizens whom I shall designate.  The Task Force shall submit such reports and recommendations as it sees fit, dealing with individuals' rights to the benefit of government services and opportunity for government service regardless of sexual orientation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

     I shall designate a Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson of the Task Force.  Its members shall receive no compensation, but shall be entitled to reimbursement for any necessary expenses incurred directly in connection with the performance of their duties.

                  GRIEVANCES PROCEDURES FOR STATE EMPLOYEES
<BR>
<BR>

                            EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 42</CENTER></B>
<BR>

     With the advent of collective negotiations between the State and employee organizations pursuant to the Public Employees' Fair Employment Act of 1967, collectively negotiated agreements ("collective agreements") have been entered into which provide for grievance procedures which are intended to supersede in whole or in part the grievance procedures provided for by the Executive Order heretofore issued on August 28, 1963.  Such negotiated grievance procedures are a milestone in the development of collective negotiations in the public sector.  Nevertheless, there is still an important reason for the continuation of procedures for the settlement of grievances of employees who are not covered by collective agreements or for the settlement of non-contract grievances which are outside of the scope of the grievance procedure set forth in any such collective agreement.
<BR>
<BR>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>1.   Every employee to whom this order applies shall have the right to           present his/her grievance in accordance with this order, free from interference, coercion, restraint, discrimination or reprisal.   He/she shall have the right to present his/her grievance individually or with a representative of his/her own choosing at all           steps of the grievance procedure hereunder, except that where there is in effect a collective agreement covering a negotiation unit which includes such employee which was entered into between the State and an employee organization, then such employee may not choose as his/her representative any employee organization other than the employee organization with which such agreement was negotiated nor may any employee organization other than the one with which such agreement was negotiated initiate or process a grievance except to the extent permitted by such agreement.
<BR>
<BR>

     2.   Grievance Appeals Board.  The Grievance Appeals Board established by  the executive order heretofore issued on August 28, 1963 shall be transferred to the Office of Employee Relations.  It shall consist of three members appointed by and who shall serve at the pleasure of the Director of Employee Relations.  No person regularly employed in a full time position in the State service shall be eligible for appointment to the Board.  One member shall be designated by the Director to serve as chairperson of the Board.  The compensation of the members of the Board shall be fixed by the Director with the approval of the Director of the Budget.
<BR>
<BR>

     3.   Departmental Procedures. The head of each State department or agency shall, subject to the approval of the Grievance Appeals Board established pursuant to this order, establish formal procedures for the submission of grievances by employees and for the prompt and orderly consideration and determination of such grievances by supervisors and the department or agency head.
<BR>
<BR>

   4.   Powers and Duties of the Grievance Appeals Board.  The Grievance Appeals Board is hereby charged with the responsibility for and empowered to: </BLOCKQUOTE>

          <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>a)  establish and maintain a program for resolving employee grievances relating to conditions of employment in the State service not inconsistent with the State's obligations as an employer under the Public Employee's Fair Employment Act of 1967 or collective agreements entered into thereunder.
<BR>
<BR>

          b)  promulgate and amend from time to time, with the approval of the  Director of Employee Relations, such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this order and to review and approve grievance procedures established by  departments and agencies pursuant to this order and such regulations, including provisions for reasonable time off without charge to leave credits for grievants, representatives and witnesses.
<BR>
<BR>

          c)  hold hearings, to conduct investigations, to require the attendance of officers and employees of the State as witnesses and to require the production or examination of records, books and papers of State departments or agencies relating to administration of the grievance procedure.
<BR>
<BR>

          d)  render advice and assistance to officers and employees of State  departments and agencies in any matter relating to the establishment or use of the procedures provided for or adopted pursuant to this order or the regulations issued thereunder.
<BR>
<BR>

          e)  report to the Director of Employee Relations for appropriate  action the failure of any department or agency to establish properly or maintain satisfactorily the standards, principles,  determinations and procedures embodied in or authorized by this order.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>5.   Appeals.  An employee within a time limit and upon compliance with the regulations of the Board, may appeal to the Board from a determination made pursuant to this order by the head of his department or agency, or his designated representative, as the case may be.  The Board shall conduct such review of the appeal as it deems appropriate and may require the appearance before it of the appellant and other parties to the grievance; provided, however,  that the appellant shall be entitled upon his/her request to a hearing before the Board or its designee.  If the appeal involves the enforcement of a law, a civil service rule or regulation or a written rule, regulation or order of a department or agency, the findings of fact and the recommendation of the Board shall be transmitted to the departments or agencies involved for appropriate action in accordance with the facts found by the Board.  In all           other cases, the determination of the Board shall contain a statement of the facts and an advisory recommendation to the departments or agencies involved.  Copies of the determination of the Board shall be sent to the employee involved, to his representative and to the Director of Employee Relations.
<BR>
<BR>

     6.   Application</BLOCKQUOTE>

          <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>a)  The provisions of this order shall apply to employees in the executive branch of the State government (1) who are not covered               by a collective agreement between the State and a certified or recognized employee organization or (2) who are covered by a collective agreement which accords such employees the right to continue to process grievances under this order.
<BR>
<BR>

          b)  The provisions of this order and the procedures established hereunder shall be applicable to grievances in any department or agency claiming an act or omission resulting in an injustice to an employee or arising out of conditions which are in whole or in part subject to the control of the head of such department or agency and which involve alleged safety or health hazards, unsatisfactory physical facilities, surroundings, materials or equipment, unfair or discriminatory supervisory and disciplinary practice, unjust treatment by fellow workers, unreasonable assignment of working hours or personal time allowances, unfair or unreasonable work quotas, and all other grievances relating to conditions of employment; provided, however, that this order shall not apply to matters which are reviewable under administrative procedures established by law or under the rule of the State Civil Service Commission, or the rules of other department or agencies having the force and effect of law or rules governing grievances of employees in the professional service of the State University of New York as defined in Section 355-a of the Education Law, or grievance concerning the interpretation, application or claimed violation of a specific               term or provision of a collective agreement between the State and an employee organization.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>7.   Repeal of Previous Order.  The Executive Order heretofore issued on August 28, 1963 is hereby revoked and superseded by this executive order.  Grievances initiated but not finally resolved prior to the effective date of this order may be continued under the terms of the executive order issued on August 28, 1963.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 1.  Recommendations based on political affiliations.  No recommendation or question under the authority of this chapter shall relate to the political opinions or affiliations of any person whatsoever; and no appointment or selection to or removal from an office or employment within the scope of this chapter or the rules established thereunder, shall be in any manner affected or influenced by such opinions or affiliations.  No person in the civil service of the state or of any civil division thereof is for that reason under any obligation to contribute to any political
fund or to render any political service, and no person shall be removed or otherwise prejudiced for refusing so to do.  No person in the said civil service shall discharge or promote or reduce,  or in any manner change the  official rank or compensation of any other      person in said service, or  promise or threaten so to do, for giving or  withholding or neglecting to make any contribution of money or service or any other valuable thing for any political purpose.

 2.  Inquiry concerning political affiliations.  No person shall directly or indirectly ask, indicate or transmit orally or in writing the political affiliations of any employee in the civil service of the state or of any civil division thereof or of any person dependent upon or related to such employee, as a test of fitness for holding office.  A violation of this subdivision shall be deemed a misdemeanor and conviction thereof shall subject the person convicted to a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars or to imprisonment for not less
than thirty days nor more than six months, or to both such fine and

<B><CENTER>APPENDIX XVIII
<BR>
<BR>

CHANCELLOR'S STATEMENT ON GOVERNANCE</CENTER></B>

<BR>

Following considerable discussion about the matter of enforcement of by-laws on local campuses, and following conferences among the Committee on Governance, the Executive Committee, the President's Council, and with the Board of Trustees, the Chancellor has developed the following Statement on Governance:
<BR>
<BR>

In the light of recent challenges to the basic structural elements of the University, I join with the Faculty Senate in affirming the validity of governance as the appropriate and organic process for the involvement of constituent groups in campus decision making.  By this statement, University faculty, staff, and administration are reminded of the charge contained in the 1972 Master Plan that "the governance arrangements within the university will be increasingly clarified and improved methods of consultation will be developed to reflect the need for effective governance based upon widespread participation.."
<BR>
<BR>

Since these challenges go to the very heart of the University, it is appropriate to underscore the traditional legal framework which establishes and protects University governance.
<BR>
<BR>

The Education Law established the Board of Trustees and charges it with the responsibility for and conduct of the University.  The Trustees, in turn, have promulgated The Policies of the Board of Trustees, et al that represent a constitution which provides basic principles of policy and organization.  The Policies of the Board of Trustees, et al vest authority in the Chancellor of the University and in campus presidents and legally established governance as the appropriate vehicle for the involvement of all constituents: faculty, staff, administration, and students.  In this regard, The Policies of the Board of Trustees, et al accord official recognition to the close interrelation between the exercise of the legal authority of the president and his or her obligation to accept constituent participation through governance.
<BR>
<BR>

Article X of The Policies of the Trustees, et al, among other provisions, empowers and directs the faculty to develop by-laws for the conduct of its affairs.  Substantive actions taken in the course of that conduct are advisory upon the president and are a recognition of his or her legal authority.  Furthermore, those provisions of by-laws concerning consultation--how, when, and where the president consults wit his faculty--are subject to his or her approval.  It is understood, of course, that by-laws often contain procedures for consultation among faculty in addition to provisions for presidential consultation with faculty.  The latter only is spoken to in Article X.
<BR>
<BR>

When the president accepts provisions of local by-laws concerning consultation, the Trustees, through Article X, and the Chancellor respect this endorsement and these provisions become, thereby, part of local policy and must provide a reliable framework for campus governance.  In this regard, a president is expected to adhere to policies which he or she has accepted for his or her administration.
<BR>
<BR>

Since governance must remain responsive to changing conditions on each campus, the validity of by-laws rests firmly upon the continuing confidence in which they are held.  By-laws, once approved, should not be used to require adherence to outmoded or bad practice by either the faculty or the president.  The campus community must remain ready to recognize legitimate objections to practices or procedures which no longer adequately meet the needs for which they were designed.  In order for governance to operate effectively, provisions must exist in each set of by-laws to permit the president and any constituent included in the governance vehicle to initiate review and modification when by-laws fail to command the confidence of those who are expected to observe them.
<BR>
<BR>

By-laws are the manifestation of the university's commitment to governance.  They have their legal basis in authorization by the Board of Trustees and their effectiveness results, in the most practical sense, from the confidence they enjoy in the campus community.  If governance is to survive, it must draw strength from its success in meeting the needs for which it was designed.  It must not rely upon external forces.  Its validity is adequately supported in the legal recognition of governance by the Trustees as essential to the proper conduct of a university.

<CENTER><B>APPENDIX XIX<BR>
POLICY ON CONFLICT OF INTEREST</B></CENTER>
<dt><br>
I.     INTRODUCTION
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 0 -->
<dt>Consistent with the mission of the State University of New York, all faculty and staff are encouraged to pursue free and open inquiry and the unrestricted dissemination of knowledge.  Open exchange of scholarly knowledge is integral to SUNY's goals of instruction, research and scholarship, and public service.  Moreover, as members of a public university, the faculty and staff of SUNY have a responsibility to ensure integrity in all aspects of the performance of their assignments.
<dt><br>
<dt>This policy represents a restatement of existing University policy and pertinent State and Federal law and regulations including:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
<dt>Policies of the Board of Trustees, Article XI, Title H, Section 4; New York State Public Officers Law, Section 73-a, and 73 and 74; 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 50, Subpart F; and National Science Foundation, Grant Policy Manual (GPM), Section 310
</dl>
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dt>II.     DEFINITION
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 0 -->
<dt>--  A conflict of interest is any interest, financial or otherwise, direct or indirect; participation in any business, transaction or professional activity; or incurring of any obligation of any nature, which is or appears to be in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of an employee's duties in the public interest.  A conflict of interest is also any financial interest that will, or may be reasonably expected to, bias the design, conduct or reporting of sponsored research.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dt>III.     POLICY
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
<dt>Faculty and staff of the University are encouraged to foster an atmosphere of academic freedom by promoting the open and timely exchange of scholarly knowledge independent of personal interests.  In keeping with this obligation, they are also required to avoid conflicts of interest.  In instances where potential or actual conflicts exist, faculty and staff are expected to consult with appropriate University officials implementing this policy to identify potential or actual conflicts of interest and take appropriate steps to manage, reduce or eliminate them.
<dt><br>
<dt>1.  SUNY faculty and staff may not engage in other employment which interferes with the performance of their professional obligation (Policies of the Board of Trustees Article XI, Title H, Section 4).
<dt><br>
<dt>2.  SUNY faculty and staff are expected to comply with the New York State Public Officers Law provisions on conflict of interest and ethical conduct (Sections 73 and 74).
<dt><br>
<dt>3.  SUNY faculty and staff, to the extent required by law or regulation, shall disclose at minimum whether they (and their spouses and dependent children) have employment or financial interests or hold significant offices, in external organizations that may affect, or appear to affect, the discharge of professional obligations to the University (as required and subject to the limits of NYS Public Officer Law 73-a, and 73, 74; 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart F; and, NSF, GPM, Section 310).
<dt><br>
<dt>4.  SUNY campuses shall ensure that all faculty and staff subject to pertinent laws and regulations disclose financial interests in accordance with procedures to be established by the Chancellor or designee.  Campuses shall retain the reported information as required, identify actual or apparent conflicts of interest and seek resolution of such conflicts.
<dt><br>
<dt>5.  Each campus President shall submit to the System Provost the name and title of the person or persons designated as financial disclosure designee(s) and shall further notify the Provost when a change in that assignment occurs.  The Provost shall also be notified of any reports regarding Conflict of Interest that are forwarded to State or Federal agencies.

<DT>
<dd><dl>4. <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="APPOINTMENT PROCEDURE">APPOINTMENT PROCEDURE</A>
<DT><BR>
The President of the College, after seeking consultation, may appoint, reappoint, or recommend to the Chancellor for appointment or reappointment such persons as are, in his/her judgment, best qualified.  Such appointments shall be consistent with the operating requirements of the College.  The term "consultation" means consideration of recommendations of academic or professional employees, including the committees, if any, of the appropriate department or professional area, and other appropriate sources in connection with appointment or reappointment of a specified employee.  Normally, such consultation consists of consideration of the recommendation of the employee's (as appropriate) department, chairperson or immediate supervisor, Dean, and Vice President.
<DT><BR>
 <Dt>All persons (full or part-time) teaching a credit-bearing course must be affiliated with the College.  Affiliation may be effected through a recommendation by the appropriate department and/or Dean, the Provost, and approval by the President for a regular, secondary, adjunct, courtesy or casual appointment on the academic staff.  This policy applies to any credit-bearing course offered during the regular session, summer session and extension programs.
<DT><BR>
 <Dt>It is the policy of SUNY Potsdam that offers of employment are made by the President of the College.  While members of the college staff may discuss salary and other terms of employment, the only binding offer from the college is extended by the President.  The schedule of submission dates pertaining to contract renewal are given in <A HREF="../Appendices/APPEN13.html">Appendix XIII</A>.

  <DT>a.)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Term Appointment">Term Appointment</A>
 <DT><BR>
<dd><dl>
  <DT>i)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Definition">DEFINITION</A>:  Pursuant to Article XI, Title D, Section 1 of the Policies of the Board of Trustees a term appointment is an appointment for a specified period of not more than three years, which automatically expires at the end of that period unless terminated earlier because of resignation, retirement, or termination.
 <DT><BR>
  <Dt>Exceptions to the above are appointments which are granted to persons serving in specified titles covered by the Agreement which by contract require five-year term appointments.  Those titles are listed in Appendix A to Article XI of the Policies of the Board of Trustees.
</dl>        
<DT><BR>
<dd><dl>
  <DT>ii)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Eligibility">ELIGIBILITY</A>:  A term appointment is made by the President and may be given to any person appointed to or serving in a position designated as being in the Professional Services Negotiating Unit.
 <DT><BR>
  <Dt>For part-time service further employment of an individual who has been employed at the College on a part-time basis for four consecutive semesters, in a position designated as being in the Professional Services Negotiating Unit shall be on the basis of a term appointment.  In computing consecutive semesters of part-time service for the purposes of appointment or reappointment, periods of leave of absence at partial salary or without salary shall not be included, but shall not be deemed an interruption of otherwise consecutive service.  
</dl>
 <DT><BR>
<dd><dl>
  <DT>iii)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Criteria">CRITERIA</A>:  The five Board of Trustees' criteria for academic or professional employee evaluations (Article XII, Title A, Section 4 and Title C, Section 5) collectively shall be the basis for term appointment decisions.  Appropriate documentation should accompany the faculty member's application.
</dl>
<DT><BR>
<dd><dl>
  <DT>iv)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Method of Appointment">METHOD OF APPOINTMENT</A>:  Pursuant to Article XI, Title D, Section 3 of the Policies of the Board of Trustees all term appointments shall be made by the President of the College.  The President's decision will be based on documentation and recommendation from the applicant's department (or school-wide personnel committee), the department chair or supervisor (as applicable), appropriate dean (or management confidential supervisor), and the appropriate vice president.  Justification in writing at each level for the recommended length of the term appointment shall accompany the application and shall be made available to the faculty member upon request.
</dl>
 <DT><BR>
<dd><dl>
  <DT>v)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Length of Term Appointment">LENGTH OF TERM APPOINTMENT</A>:  Term appointments shall normally be for two or three years, except when special circumstances, explained in writing by the President, warrant some other length of appointment.
</dl>
 <DT><BR>
<dd><dl>
  <DT>vi)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Renewal of Term">RENEWAL OF TERM</A>:  Term appointments may be renewed by the President based on the criteria and following the method outlined in points ii), iii), iv) and v) above for successive periods of not more than three years except each as noted in i).
</dl>
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>b)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Temporary Appointment">Temporary Appointment</A>
<dt><br>
			<dt>A temporary appointment is an appointment which may be terminated at any time.  A temporary appointment may be given to any person appointed to or serving in a position designated as being in the Professional Services Negotiating Unit and ordinarily is given only when service is anticipated to be part-time, consistent with a) ii) above voluntary, for a period of less than one year or when an employee's initial appointment in the University is made to a position vacated by a professional employee who is serving a probationary appointment pursuant to Title C, section 5 or Title D, section 6 of the Policies.  A temporary appointment is also appropriate whenever a position has been vacated by an employee on approved leave.
<dt><br>
			<dt>However, after three consecutive years of full-time service on the basis of a temporary appointment, a full-time employee whose employment is continued on the basis of a temporary appointment  shall be given the reasons for such appointment.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>c)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Probationary Appointment">Probationary Appointment</A>
<dt><br>
			<dt>A probationary appointment is an appointment for a period of one year which must be granted to a professional employee holding a professional title in which permanent appointment may be granted when he/she is appointed to a different professional title in which permanent appointment may be granted or to a professional title requiring a five-year term appointment.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>d)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Continuing Appointment">Continuing Appointment</A>
<dt><br>
			<dt>A continuing appointment is an appointment made to a position of academic rank which is not affected by changes in such rank and continues until resignation, retirement, or termination.  Continuing appointments are made by the Chancellor on recommendation of the President.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Continuing appointment as Professor, Associate Professor, Librarian, or Associate Librarian may be given on initial appointment or thereafter.  Further employment in such ranks after the third consecutive year of service in any one of these ranks at the College must be on the basis of continuing appointment, however, such appointment is not effective until made so by the Chancellor.
<dt><br>               
			<dt>Promotion to any of the above listed ranks does not extend the service requirements for continuing appointment in all other ranks in which such appointment may be granted.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Further employment of an employee who has completed a total of seven years of service in a position or positions of academic rank of which the last three consecutive years have been in a position of academic rank at the College as Assistant Professor, Instructor, Senior Assistant Librarian, or Assistant Librarian must be on the basis of continuing appointment, however, such appointment is not effective until made so by the Chancellor.  An employee in such positions is not eligible for continuing appointment at any of these ranks prior to the completion of a total of seven years in a position or positions of academic rank.
<dt><br>
			<dt>In computing consecutive years of service for the purposes of continuing appointment to the academic staff, periods of leave of absence at partial salary or without salary and periods of part- time service shall not be included, but shall not be deemed an interruption of otherwise consecutive service.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Satisfactory full-time prior service in academic rank at any other accredited academic institution of higher education may, at the request of the employee and in the discretion of the President (or designee), be credited as service, up to a maximum of three years, toward continuing appointment as Assistant Professor, Instructor, Senior Assistant Librarian or Assistant Librarian.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl> 
		<dt>e)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Permanent Appointment">Permanent Appointment</A>
<dt><br>
			<dt>A permanent appointment is an appointment of a faculty member to a professional title, except those professional titles requiring five-year term appointment, which continues until a change in such title, resignation, retirement, or termination.  Permanent appointments are made by the Chancellor on recommendation of the President.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Further employment, in a professional title in which permanent appointment may be granted, of a professional employee who has completed seven consecutive years of full-time service as a professional employee at the College, the last two of which have been in that professional title must be on the basis of permanent appointment, however, such appointment is not effective until made so by the Chancellor.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Upon completion of three consecutive years of full-time services as a professional employee at the College, the last year of which has been in that professional title, a professional employee in the first four salary ranks may request early consideration for permanent appointment.  Such request must be in writing and submitted to the President of the College no later than nine months prior to the date upon which such employee would otherwise receive written notice that a term appointment is not to be renewed upon expiration.  In the event the President of the College grants the employee's request for such early consideration, any further employment of that employee after completion of five consecutive years of full-time services as a professional employee at that College, the last two years of which have been in that professional title, must be on the basis of permanent appointment; provided, however that such appointment shall not be effective until made so by the Chancellor.
<dt><br>
			<dt>In computing consecutive years of service for the purpose of permanent appointment of professional employees, periods of leave of absence at full salary and periods of full-time service in probationary and temporary appointments shall be included; periods of leave of absence at partial salary or without salary and periods of part-time service shall not be included but shall not be deemed an interruption of consecutive service.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Satisfactory full-time prior service in a professional title  covered by the Agreement at any one college of the University may, at the request of the professional employee and in the discretion of the President (or designee) be credited as service, up to a maximum of three years, toward permanent appointment.

		<dt>f)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Non-Renewal of Term Appointment">Non-Renewal of Term Appointment</A>
<dt><br>
			<dt>The Policies of the Board of Trustees and the Agreement spell out the timetable for reviewing faculty for reappointment and awarding continuing or permanent appointment.
<dt><br>
			<dt>In the event a term appointment is not to be renewed upon expiration, the President will notify the appointee in writing not less than:
<dt><br>
			<dd><dl>
<dt>i)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Part-Time Service">PART-TIME SERVICE</A>:
<dt><br>
				<dt>45 calendar days prior to the end of a part-time service appointment.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>ii)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Full-Time Service">FULL-TIME SERVICE</A>:
<dt><br>     
				<dt>Three months prior to the end of a term expiring at the end of an appointee's first year of uninterrupted service within the University, but not later than March 1 for terms ending in June, July or August;
<dt><br>
			<dt>Six months prior to the end of a term expiring after the completion of one, but not more than two years of an appointee's uninterrupted service within the University, but not later than December 15 for terms ending June, July or August; and
<dt><br>
				<dt>Twelve months prior to the expiration of a term after two or more years of uninterrupted service within the University.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Where a non-renewal constitutes a denial of continuing or permanent appointment, Article 33 of the Agreement provides timetables and procedures for appealing that decision to the Chancellor.
</dl>
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
		<dt>g)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Casual Appointment">Casual (CSL) Appointment</A>
<dt><br>
			<dt>Temporary appointments of a limited nature, as defined by the University, are not covered by contractual provisions.  Such employees are given "CSL" titles, and are not subject to agency shop fee deduction, nor entitled to negotiated salary increases or minimums.  Casual employees are compensated in some manner other than basic annual salary (i.e., biweekly, hourly, fee for service, or per diem), with full payment generally made during the course of the contractual period.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Appointment to a casual title has no impact on a person's eligibility to participate in the State's various health and retirement plans, though such employees are not entitled to leave accruals.               
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>i)	University guidelines for casual faculty appointments in the titles of Lecturer (CSL), Instructor (CSL), Assistant Professor (CSL), Associate Professor (CSL), and Professor (CSL) are:
<dt><br>
				<dt>-teach no more than one course totaling three contact hours, or its equivalent.  These individuals would not perform the full range of professional obligation, or a pro-rata portion thereof (e.g., teaching, research, community service, etc.) in exchange for a basic annual salary as would a regular part-time employee; but rather are retained on other than a basic annual salary basis to provide a specific and limited service; 
<dt><br>
				or 
<dt><br>
				<dt>-provide service for a period of less than six weeks per year; 	
<dt><br>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>ii)	University guidelines for casual faculty appointments in the titles of Technical Assistant (CSL) or Technical Specialist (CSL) are:

				<dt>-provide less than 20 hours of service per week.  These individuals would not perform the full range of professional obligation, or a pro-rata portion thereof, in exchange for a basic annual salary as would a regular part-time employee; but rather are retained on other than basic annual salary to provide a specific and limited service.
<dt><br>
				<dt>-provide service for a period of less than six weeks per year, customarily on a task or project related basis; or
<dt><br>
				<dt>-are appointed on a non-recurring basis.  (e.g., to complete a particular finite task with no present intention that they will provide additional service.)  As a group, individuals within these titles should  demonstrate a rate of return from year to year of less than 60 percent.

<dd><dl>     
		<dt>i)	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Secondary Appointment">Secondary Appointment</A>
<dt><br>     
			<dt>In order to encourage cross-fertilization among disciplines, and particularly across department lines, SUNY Potsdam has established a system of secondary appointments, whereby members of other departments are invited to participate in the work of a second department for a limited period without voting powers.  Secondary appointments of this kind are established under the following guidelines:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>i)	at the request of a faculty member seeking a joint appointment, such appointment shall be initiated by the Dean of the School in which the faculty member has his/her primary appointment.  That Dean shall consult with the Dean of the School in which the secondary appointment is proposed.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>ii)	the Dean of the second School shall consult with the department in which the appointment is sought and shall report that recommendation and his/her own recommendation to the Provost.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>iii)	the Provost shall consult with the Deans and with the President.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>iv)	the President shall approve or disapprove the joint appointment and shall notify the applicant in writing of his/her decision.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>               
			<dt>v)	a secondary appointment in a department other than the faculty member's home department does not create continuing appointment rights in the secondary department.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>vi)	secondary appointments will be for a fixed term, normally of three years, and will be renewable.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>vii)	a secondary appointment entitles the individual in question to attend meetings of his/her secondary department without voting privileges.  The appointee has no teaching obligations, and such appointments are without salary.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>     
			<dt>viii)	individuals with secondary appointments may cross-list their courses with their secondary departments and, upon approval from their primary department, teach courses for the secondary departments.  In such instances, special arrangements must be made among the department heads and the dean.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>ix)	secondary appointments will have no effect on decisions regarding retrenchment.  An individual with a secondary appointment in another department will be regarded as a fully contributing member of his or her primary department and will retain full seniority in that department.  A decision to retrench all or part of the department in which the individual holds a secondary appointment will have no effect on this individual.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>x)	secondary appointments will normally be at the same rank as primary appointments.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>xi)	secondary appointments may cross school lines, i.e. an individual in one school may be given a secondary appointment in a department in another school.  In these cases, the individual may attend meetings of the faculty of their second school and serve on its committees, but may not normally have voting rights in full faculty meetings.

          <center><strong>V.  HEALTH, DEPENDENT CARE AND MEDICAL RELATED BENEFITS </strong></center>    

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<A NAME="5A"><b>A</A>.	HEALTH INSURANCE</b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>The College provides the opportunity to join one of two health insurance plans:  THE EMPIRE PLAN or The Mohawk Valley Health Maintenance Organization (MVP-HMO).

	<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5A1"><i>1</A>.	THE EMPIRE PLAN</i>

		<dt><br>
<dd></dl>
The Empire Plan offers hospitalization coverage provided through Blue Cross, and medical/surgical for Major Medical benefits provided through the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.
<dt><br>
		<dl>	The Empire Plan, although offering few preventive services, is designed to provide a comprehensive program of protection against most medical expenses, with an emphasis on insurance against the often catastrophic costs that result from major illness.  The plan also provides flexibility in the selection of participating providers (physicians) or other providers of services.  In recognition of the broad protection available, and to provide an incentive for the prudent utilization of benefits, the Empire Plan has both an annual deductible as well as a coinsurance feature for most charges covered under the major medical portion of the plan.  However, some hospital charges covered by Blue Cross are subject to a coinsurance payment for out-patient treatment.
</dl>
</dl>
<dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt><blockquote><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="5A2">2</A>.	THE MVP HEALTH PLAN (HMO)</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The MVP Health Plan is an innovative plan which combines the comprehensive benefits of an HMO with the ability to continue seeing local doctors in their private offices.  Participating physicians must be used except in exceptional cases.  There are no deductibles, no claim forms and no lifetime maximums.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Employees can pay their share of the health insurance premium on a pre-tax basis.  Contact the Office of Human Resources for details.

	</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>3.	<A NAME="5A3">ELIGIBILITY</A></i>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>a)	all employees with full-time appointments anticipated to last at least 12 weeks;
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>b)	part-time managerial/confidential (M/C) employees who are at least half-time or more, who have appointments that are anticipated to last at least twelve (12) weeks and who work on a regular schedule;

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>c)	part-time academic employees who teach two or more courses in any one semester (excluding casual employees);

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>d)	part-time professional employees if they are employed at a salary rate which would yield a total compensation of $9,000 or more per year, (excluding casual employees) are eligible to elect a plan.
</dl>
	</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5A4"><i>4</A>.	EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Coverage is effective on the 43rd day of employment if election is made before that date.  The cost of coverage is dependent upon whether individual or family coverage is elected.

	</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5A5"><i>5</A>.	PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTION PROGRAM</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>At the time an employee enrolls in a health insurance plan, he/she must also decide whether they would like to enroll in the Pre-Tax Contribution Program (PTCP).  Under the PTCP an employee may have their share of the health insurance bi-weekly premium deducted from their gross wages before taxes are withheld.  This program may lower taxes.  (Employees on Leave-Without-Pay making direct payments for health insurance are not eligible to participate in this program).  The amount of money saved in taxes will be dependent upon the employees' income, health insurance premium and the number of withholding allowances claimed on their taxes.
<dt><br>
		<dt>If an employee enrolls in the PTCP, the Internal Revenue Service places restrictions on changes that an employee can make to their health insurance.  Under the Internal Revenue Service rules, employees can change their pre-tax health insurance deduction if certain qualifying events exist or during the annual health insurance Option Transfer Period. (See the Office of Human Resources for more information on this plan.)

	</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5A6"><i>6</A>.	THE EMPIRE PLAN'S MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM</i>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>a)	The Plan
<dt><br>
			<dt>Effective February 1, 1992 (for employees represented by UUP and M/C employees and retirees), benefits for mental health and substance abuse became administered by American Psych Management (APM) and insured by Metropolitan Life.  APM changed it's name to Value Behavioral Health in March, 1994.
<dt><br>
			<dt>The program has two levels of benefits, Network and Non-Network. By calling Value Behavioral Health (VBH) and obtaining care for a mental health and/or substance abuse problem from a provider VBH recommends, the patient's out-of-pocket expense is significantly reduced.  Modest copayments are required for outpatient care and inpatient care is paid in full under the Network benefits.  There are no maximum benefit levels for medically necessary care.
</dl>
</dl>
</dl>
<dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt><blockquote><A NAME="5A7">7</A>.	 MANAGED PHYSICAL MEDICINE PROGRAM<br><BR>


		The Empire Plan's Managed Physical Medicine Program began August 1, 1995.  This program replaces current Metropolitan coverage for chiropractic treatment and physical therapy.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<blockquote>a)	Network Benefits
<dt><br>
	<dt>		There is an $8 copayment per visit when you use a network provider for chiropractic treatment or physical therapy.  The MPN provider will be responsible for certifying the medical necessity of care.  All certified services will be paid in full except for an $8 copayment.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>b)	How to find a Network Provider<BR>
<BR>
	

			The MPN network includes most current Empire Plan participating providers who provide chiropractic treatment or physical therapy.  It also includes many additional providers who meet MPN's high credentialing standards.<BR>
<BR>
Contact a provider directly and ask if the provider is in the MPN network, or call Metropolitan at 1-800-942-4640 and select the Managed Physical Medicine Program from the automated telephone system menu.  What if there are no MPN providers in the area?  Beginning August 1, 1995, you are guaranteed that network benefits will be available to you under the Managed Physical Medicine Program.<BR>
<BR>
Call Metropolitan at 1-800-942-4640.  MPN will make arrangements for you to receive medically necessary chiropractic treatment or physical therapy, and you will pay only your $8 copayment for each visit.<BR>
<BR>
But, you must call first and you must use the provider MPN recommends.  Remember, the Empire Plan covers only medically necessary treatment.<br>
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>c)	Non-Network Benefits (Deductible, Coinsurance, Annual Maximum Apply)<BR>
<BR>
If you receive chiropractic treatment or physical therapy from a non-network provider when MPN has not made arrangements for you, you will pay a much higher share of the cost.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><dl>1)	Deductible Applies<BR>
<BR>
You must meet the Managed Physical Medicine Program annual deductible of $250.  Your spouse/domestic partner must meet the $250 annual deductible, and all your enrolled children, combined, must meet the $250 annual deductible.  This deductible is separate from other Plan deductibles.<BR>
<BR>
</dl>
<dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>2)	Coinsurance and $1,500 Annual Maximum Apply<BR>
<BR>
After you meet your deductible, submit a claim to Metropolitan.  You will be reimbursed up to 50 percent of the network allowance for medically necessary services, subject to a maximum annual benefit of $1,500 per covered person.<BR>
<BR>
	Your out-of-pocket expenses under the Managed Physical Medicine Program do not count toward your  Basic Medical annual deductible and coinsurance maximum or toward your Mental Health and Substance Abuse deductibles.<BR>
<BR>	
If Metropolitan determines that the non-network care you received was not medically necessary, you will not receive any Empire Plan benefits, and you will be responsible for the full cost of care.</blockquote></dl>

</dl>
<dt>
<dd><dl><dt><A NAME="5A8"><i>8</A>.	THE DEPENDENT CARE ADVANTAGE ACCOUNT</i>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>a)	The Plan
<dt><br>
			<dt>This program is a New York State employee benefit that allows employees to pay for certain child care, elder care or disabled dependent care expenses on a pre-tax basis.  Employees may set aside up to $5,000 of pre-tax salary annually to be reimbursed for these costs.  These expenses must be incurred to allow you and your spouse, if married, to work.  Employees with dependent children under the age of 13, handicapped children of any age, or adult relatives needing care, may be interested in participating in this program.
<dt><br>
<dt>When an employee enrolls in the DCA Account, a regular pattern of the annual amount will be deducted from his/her bi-weekly paychecks throughout the year.  The deductions are made before State, Federal or Social Security taxes are calculated on an employee's gross pay, thereby reducing taxes and increasing spendable income.
<dt><br>
<dt>Due to the tax-advantage, there are several strict guidelines issued by the Internal Revenue Service.  One of them is the "use it or lose it rule".  This means that if an employee deposits pre-tax dollars into a reimbursement account and does not incur expenses equal to all of the money in the account, the employee will lose any remaining money in the account.  IRS guidelines will not permit any remaining dollars to be returned to the employee or carried over for the next year.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>b)	Eligibility
<dt><br>
			<dt>Any employee of the NYS Executive, Legislative, or Judicial Branches and Employees of Participating Employers who receive a regular bi-weekly paycheck as an employee of New York State is eligible to enroll in this program.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>c)	Enrollment
 <dt><br>    
			<dt>New employees are eligible to enroll in the DCA Account and must enroll within 30 days of their initial employment date.  Active employees and new employees who choose not to initially enroll in the program may do so during the Annual Open Enrollment Period, which occurs during the Fall of each year.
<dt><br>
<dt>For more information on this program, contact the Office of Human Resources.

<dt><blockquote><A NAME="5A9"><i>9.	CONTINUATION IN RETIREMENT</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>If you meet the minimum employment requirements set forth below at the time of your retirement from State service, you will be eligible to continue your coverage, and that of your enrolled dependents, into retirement.  As an enrolled retiree, your coverage will be continued under the option in which you were enrolled at time of retirement, although you may elect to change options.  However, if you were formerly a member of a bargaining unit and eligible to receive benefits from a union's Employee Benefit Fund or special benefits negotiated for members of your unit, there may be some change in benefits and/or the method of obtaining them after retirement.
<dt><br>
		<dt>The requirements for continuation of coverage in retirement are as follows:                    

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>a)	An employee whose most recent date of employment in State service is prior to April 1, 1975, may continue health insurance coverage in retirement provided that at the time of retirement the employee:

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>i)	has had a least five years of State service, not necessarily continuous, or has had at least five years of combined service with the State and one or more Participating Agencies; and
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>ii)	has retired as a member of a retirement system administered by the State of New York or any of its political subdivisions; or be enrolled in the optional retirement plan offered by TIAA-CREF,

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>(1) is at least 55 years of age, or

				</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>(2) has qualified for Social Security disability payments and has had at least ten years of State service in the case of an ordinary disability retirement and
</dl>
			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>iii)	is enrolled in a New York State Health Insurance Plan at the time of retirement.
</dl>
		</dl>
<dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>b)	An employee whose most recent date of employment in State service is on or after April 1, 1975, may continue health  insurance coverage in retirement provided the employee:

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>i)	has had at least 10 years of State service, not necessarily continuous, or has had at least ten years of combined service with the State and one or more Participating Agencies; and

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>ii)	has retired as a member of a retirement system administered by the State of New York or one of its political subdivisions; or be enrolled in the optional retirement plan offered by TIAA-CREF
<dt><br>
				<dd>(1) is at least 55 years of age if employment began with     NYS prior to 9/1/83,
				<dd>(2) is at least age 62 if employment began with NYS                              on or after 9/1/83;
				<dd>(3) has qualified for Social Security disability                              payments and

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>iii)	is enrolled in a New York State Health Insurance Plan at the time of retirement.
<dt><br>
				<dt>NOTE:  The five and ten-year minimum service requirements do not apply in the case of a disability retirement resulting from a work-incurred illness or injury.  In such cases, no minimum period of service is required.
<dt><br>
			<dt>An employee who is eligible to continue health insurance coverage into retirement is entitled to use their accumulated unused sick leave, up to a maximum of 165 days to offset all or part of the cost of their health insurance coverage during retirement.  An employee's sick leave is converted into a dollar amount by dividing the total dollar value of sick leave by the employee's actuarial life expectancy in months.  The result is a lifetime monthly credit which is applied to the employee's health insurance premium for as long as he/she remains enrolled in a New York State Health Insurance Plan.  Although the cost of health insurance coverage may change, the amount of monthly credit remains the same throughout the retirees lifetime, thereby resulting in an increase in premium that the retiree will have to pay.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Credit for unused sick leave may be provided only if the employee meets both of the following provisions:
<dt><br>
				<dt><blockquote>the employee's compensation is paid directly by the State; and
<dt><br>
				<dt>the employee is subject to a plan administered by law, rule, regulation, written order or written policy which provides for the regular earning and accumulation of sick leave.</blockquote>
</dl>

<dt><br>
			<dd>Effective 1/1/89 for M/C Employees<br>
			<dd>Effective 9/1/91 for Employees represented by UUP
<dt><br>
			<dt>At the time of retirement, an employee may specify that they would like their dependent survivors to be able to use their monthly sick leave credit towards the cost of their health insurance premium if they should die.  If an employee wishes to choose this option, it must be done before the last day on the payroll.
<dt><br>
<dt>This benefit allows an employee to select 70% of their sick leave credits towards the cost of the health insurance premium for as long as they live.  If the enrollee should die, his/her dependents may continue to use the 70% of the monthly credit for their health insurance premium.  The opportunity to elect Dual Annuitant Sick Leave is available only once, at the time of retirement.  Once this is elected it may not be discontinued.  If an enrollee's dependents should predecease him/her, the enrollee will maintain the 70% sick leave credit.

<dt><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="5A9d">d)</A>	Deferred Health Insurance Coverage for Retirees
<dt><br>
			<dt>Employees that retire may elect to delay the start of their health insurance coverage in retirement.  During this deferment period, enrollees who have health insurance coverage through their spouse's employer and through post-retirement employment, do not pay anything to the State Health Insurance Program.  Deferring coverage also means that the retiree's sick leave credit, calculated when the retiree is older, will be higher than it would otherwise be at the time of retirement.
<dt><br>
<dt>If the retiree dies while coverage is deferred, the spouse and/or eligible dependents may transfer back to the State Health Insurance Program.  To elect Deferred Health Insurance Coverage, the enrollee must complete the appropriate form (available through the Office of Human Resources) and furnish proof of continued coverage through a spouse's health care plan or through post-retirement employment.
<dt><br>
<dt>*M/C employees may elect to defer the start of their health insurance coverage indefinitely.  <BR>
** Employees represented by UUP may elect to defer the start of their health insurance coverage for up to 5 years.

<dt><blockquote><A NAME="5A10"><i>10</A>.	DEPENDENT ELIGIBILITY</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The following types of dependents are eligible to be enrolled in the program.  

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>a)	Your spouse, including a legally separated spouse.  If you are divorced, or your marriage has been annulled, your former spouse is not eligible for coverage even if the court orders the coverage to be maintained.  

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>b)	Your unmarried children under 19 years of age. This includes your natural children, legally adopted children, including children in a waiting period prior to the finalization of an adoption, and your dependent step-children.  Other children who reside permanently with you in your household who are chiefly dependent on you, are also eligible.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>c)	Your unmarried children 19 years of age or older but under 25 who receive more than half of their support from you and who are full-time students at an accredited secondary or preparatory school, college or other accredited educational institution, and are otherwise not eligible for employer group coverage.  They continue to be eligible through the month in which they complete course requirements for graduation.  Time spent in US military service, not to exceed four years, may be deducted from the dependent's age for the purpose of establishing eligibility for coverage.
<dt><br>
<dt>Unmarried dependent children over age 19, but under age 25, are also eligible when less than full-time course work is needed to satisfy the requirements for graduation as long as i) the child was a full-time student in the term immediately preceding the semester or trisemester in which course requirements will be completed, and ii) be able to provide a statement from the school or college administrator which certifies the student's status. If the above criteria are met, the child will be eligible for dependent student status through the end of the month in which he/she completes course requirements for graduation.  Coverage will not be extended beyond this semester or trimester unless full-time student status is resumed.
<dt><br>
<dt>An enrolled dependent child whose 19th birthday occurs during school vacation period will continue to be covered under the program, provided the child is enrolled in a school and it is anticipated the child will resume full-time student status at the end of the vacation period.
<dt><br>
<dt>In the event a dependent student is disabled and is granted a medical leave by the school he or she is attending, health insurance coverage will be continued for a maximum of one year from the month in which the student withdraws from school plus  any time before the start of the next regular semester.  Written documentation must be provided from the school and physician.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>d)	Your unmarried child 19 years of age or older who is incapable of self-support by reason of mental or physical disability and who became so incapable before reaching age 19.
<dt><br>
<dt>The eligibility of such a dependent should be established as early as possible.  This should be done at the time of your initial enrollment if the child is age 19 or older at that time. If the child has not attained age 19 at the time you first enroll in the program, eligibility for continued coverage should be established at the time of his, or her, 19th birthday.

</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>e)	Your domestic partner.  A domestic partner is defined as one in which the partners must be 18 years of age or older, unmarried and not related by marriage or blood in a way that would bar marriage, reside together, involved in a committed (lifetime) rather than casual relationship and mutually interdependent financially.  The partners must be each other's sole domestic partner and must have been involved in the domestic partnership for a period of not less than six (6) months.
<dt><br>
			<dt>The Office of Human Resources can provide the forms and instructions necessary to establish eligibility.
</dl>
	</dl>


<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>11.	<A NAME="11">DOMESTIC PARTNER BENEFIT</A><BR>
<BR>


			Pursuant to language in the agreements between New York State and the unions, a domestic partnership is one in which both partners are:  18 years of age or older; unmarried and not related by marriage or blood in a way that would bar marriage; residing together; involved in a committed (lifetime) rather than casual relationship, and mutually interdependent financially.  The partners must be each other's sole domestic partner and must have been involved in the domestic partnership for a period of not less than six (6) months.  The partners must be able to document all of these criteria for the enrollment in a health insurance plan to be permitted.

			<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>a)	Enrolling a Domestic Partner<BR>
<BR>

	
					To begin the enrollment process, please contact Human Resources to obtain the domestic partner enrollment package.  This includes the Affidavit of Domestic partnership, Afficavit of Financial Interdependence, Dependent Tax Affidavit, Termination of Domestic Partnership Form and a Health Insurance Transaction Form (PS-404).  Completed documents are to be returned to Human Resources along with two items to proof of financial interdependence and proof of six month residency.  The Affidavit of Financial Interdependence includes a list of acceptable proofs.</dl>

			
		<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>	b)	Effective Date of Coverage<BR>
<BR>


					For applications received after March 1, 1995, the date of coverage will be six months after the latest date on the documents of proof that are submitted with the application.</dl>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>			c)	Dental and Vision Coverage<BR>
<BR>


					If an employee enrolls a domestic partner for health insurance and is eligible for the State administered dental and vision programs, the partner will automatically be eligible for dental and vision coverage.  If the employee receives prescription drug, dental and vision benefits from the CSEA Employee Benefit Fund or the UUP Benefit Trust Fund, the partner will also be eligible for those benefits based on the same eligibility criteria and application process used for health insurance enrollment.  The Funds will take the necessary action to provide applicable fund benefits to the partner.  They will contact the enrollee for any additional information they may need to complete enrollment of the partner for Fund-provided benefits.</dl>

		<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>	d)	Imputed Income<BR>
<BR>


					Covering a Domestic partner will almost always result in additional taxable income.  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules require the fair market value of the coverage provided to the domestic partner to be considered imputed income to the employee.  This means that the amount of taxable income reported on the employee's W-2 form will be increased by the fair market value of that coverage.  The fair market value of State-administered benefits equals the "gross" (before application of interest and dividend) individual premium less the employee's contribution for dependent coverage.  An employee who enrolls a domestic partner for health insurance and who has State-administered dental/vision benefits will also have the value of those benefits included as income.  This is required by the IRS because those benefits are automatically available to all eligible dependents.  There is no "opt-out", so the employee is in "constructive receipt" of State-administered dental/vision benefits for the partner as soon as (s)he demonstrates the partner's eligibility for coverage.

					For example, if the employee is an M/C employee, the imputed income for each pay period for 1995 will be approximately $74.40 (gross bi-weekly cost of health, dental and vision coverage, less premium paid by employee).  This means that if an M/C employee covers a domestic partner for 20 pay periods in 1995, (s)he will have to pay taxes on an additional $1,488.00 of income reported on his/her W-2.  This figure includes the value of health (including prescription drug benefits), dental and vision coverage.  Paycheck deductions for income tax and FICA contributions will also be adjusted to reflect this higher income level.</dl>

			<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt></dl>e)	Imputed Income Exception<BR>
<BR>


					If a domestic partner qualifies as a dependent under IRS Code Section 152 (copy enclosed with application package), there is no imputed income for the employee and none will be reported to the IRS if the dependent tax affidavit in the enrollment package is submitted by the employee at the time of application.  Employees will be required to review the IRS dependent status of the partner annually.  Mid-year adjustments will not be made to imputed income, payroll tax withholding and FICA contributions based on gain or loss of IRS dependent status.  If the partner's IRS dependent status changes mid-year, the employee will be responsible for reporting and paying taxes on the value of coverage provided to the partner for the entire year with that year's income tax return.<dl>

			<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt></blockquote></dl>f)	Pre/Post-Tax Deductions<BR>
<BR>


					IRS rules mandate that an employee who enrolls a domestic partner must pay the additional employee contribution for dependent coverage on a post-tax basis although the individual premium can remain pre-tax.  The Office of the State Comptroller will shortly be able to split health insurance deductions into pre- and post-tax components.  Employees who currently have pre-tax individual coverage, will have a post-tax deduction for the additional premium for dependent coverage.  Employees who already have family coverage on a pre-tax basis, will have their deductions split into pre-and post-tax components to meet IRS requirements.</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><blockquote>g)	Terminating Domestic Partner Coverage<BR>
<BR>


					When a domestic partner relationship ends, the employee must fill out and sign the Termination of Domestic Partnership Form within 14 days of the termination.  This form is part of the enrollment package.  The employee will not be eligible to enroll another domestic partner or re-enroll the same partner until six months after the Termination of Domestic Partnership Form is submitted to the Office of Human Resources.</dl>

		<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>	h)	Other Information<BR>
<BR>


					Eligibility for coverage of children of domestic partners will continue to be based on the New York State Health Insurance Program's eligibility criteria for "other children."  Note that these criteria assess the child's dependent status with respect to the enrollee and should be separate from the eligibility of the domestic partner.

					Domestic partners who survive a deceased employee will be eligible for dependent survivor coverage under the same circumstances as surviving spouses.

					Domestic partners who lose coverage eligibility will have 60 days following their loss of coverage in which to elect COBRA continuation.  The 60 day application period begins on the day eligibility is lost, not the day the termination form is filed, so termination notices must be filed promptly.

					Retirees may enroll domestic partners and must contact the New York State Department of Civil Services' Employee Benefits Division Program Service Unit directly to apply<BR>

<dt><A NAME="5A12"><i>12</A>.	COVERAGE WHILE ON LEAVE OF ABSENCE WITHOUT PAY</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>If an employee is granted a leave of absence without pay, or otherwise leaves the State payroll temporarily, he/she may be eligible to continue health insurance coverage while off the payroll. In order to do so, the employee must pay both the employee and employer shares of the premium.  The NYS Department of Civil Service Division of Employee Benefits will notify the employee as to the cost of the bi-weekly payment and due date of the first payment.  Failure to make payments on time will cause a cancellation of health insurance coverage.  Conversion privileges will not be offered.  In order to reinstate coverage while on leave, there will be a break in coverage and the enrollee will be subject to late enrollment provisions.
<dt><br>
<dt>If an employee is on leave-without-pay for 28 days or less and has not canceled his/her coverage, the employee and employer shares of the health insurance premium for that period will be automatically deducted from his/her paycheck once he/she has returned to work.
<dt><br>
<dt>If an employee does not want to continue health insurance coverage while off the payroll, coverage must be canceled prior to the last day on the payroll.  All employees should contact the Office of Human Resources concerning their insurance coverage while on leave prior to the beginning of a leave of absence without pay in order to complete the necessary paperwork and review the available options.

<dt><A NAME="5A13"><i>13</A>.	LOSS OF ELIGIBILITY - CONTINUATION OF COVERAGE THROUGH COBRA AND CONVERSION PRIVILEGES</i>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>a)	Continuation Of Coverage - Managerial/Confidential Employees (M/C) and Academic and Professional Employees (UUP)
<dt><br>
<dt>The Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliations Act (COBRA) provides for a temporary extension of health care coverage under the New York State Health Insurance Plan to an employee and covered dependents who are otherwise no longer eligible to continue this benefit.  COBRA provisions are available to Managerial/Confidential employees and employees represented by UUP.

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>i)	Eligibility

<dt><br>
<dd>(a) Employees and dependents who lose coverage because     the employee has been terminated for any reason     (other than gross misconduct), or has a reduction in     hours of employment whereby coverage would     terminate.
<dt><br>
    <dd>If an employee is terminated for gross misconduct,     he/she may be able to continue coverage under the     NYS Continuation of Coverage Law.

<dt><br>
<dd>(b) The spouse and dependent children of an active     employee has the right to continue coverage under     COBRA for any of the following reasons:
<dt><br>
<dd>1. the death of the employee,<br>
				    <dd>2. the divorce or legal separation of the employee<br>
				    <dd>3. the dependent child of the employee no longer meets the eligibility requirements

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>ii)	Length of Coverage
<dt><br>
<dd>(a) Continuation of coverage for an employee's spouse and/or dependent children may be continued for up to 3 years unless coverage was lost due to termination of employment or a reduction of work hours.  If this is the case, the required continuation coverage period is 18 months. 
<dt><br>
				<dd>(b) Continued coverage through COBRA will cease for any person if:
<dt><br>
				   <dd>(1) New York State no longer provides group             health care coverage to any of its employees, or the union Employee Benefit             Fund no longer provides the type of coverage to State employees;

<dt>iii)	Available Benefits
<dt><br>
				<dt>All Medical, Hospital, Drug, Dental, Vision, and Hearing Care insurance coverages available as an active employee (or the dependent of an active employee) are available under COBRA.  Employees represented by UUP are also eligible to continue benefits provided by the UUP Benefit Trust Fund through COBRA.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>iv)	Cost of Continued Coverage
<dt><br>
				<dt>Any person who elects to continue coverage under the Plan must pay the gross premium (employee cost plus employer cost) plus a two percent (2%) administrative fee.  Payments for continued coverage must be made in advance on the first day of each month for which coverage will be provided.  Employees represented by UUP must also make payment directly to the UUP Benefit Trust Fund to continue dental, vision and prescription benefits.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>v)	Notices
<dt><br>
				<dt>The Division of Employee Benefits will notify eligible enrollees of their continuation rights.  Eligible enrollees and dependents have sixty (60) days from the date the coverage ends or the date of the notice, whichever is later, to elect coverage and submit one month's payment.  However, the employee or covered spouse or covered dependent child must notify the Division of Employee Benefits in writing in the event of a divorce, legal separation, or when the dependent child no longer qualifies as a covered dependent under the plan.  *The written notification must be made within sixty (60) days of such event to qualify the dependent for continuation of coverage.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>vi)	When COBRA Will Not Be Offered
<dt><br>
				<dt>COBRA coverage will not be offered when an employee/dependent is able to continue coverage in the State Health Insurance Plan.  Examples of this would be when an employee dies and a dependent continues coverage as a dependent survivor or when the employment terminates and the employee continues coverage in vested status.
</dl>
		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>b)	Continuation of Coverage - Direct-Pay Conversion Contracts 
<dt><br>
			<dt>Under certain conditions, New York State Health Insurance Plan (NYSHIP) enrollees and their dependents are entitled to direct- pay conversion contracts after NYSHIP coverage ends or after continuation of coverage in NYSHIP under COBRA ends.  The benefit package and the premium costs for direct-pay conversion contracts may differ from those under NYSHIP.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>c)	Conversion Privileges
<dt><br>
			<dt>An employee will be given the opportunity to convert to direct-pay conversion contract(s) with the carrier(s) of their former coverage, if the enrollee and eligible dependents lose eligibility to continue coverage under NYSHIP for any of the following reasons:

			<dd>3.	vestees who have failed to remit payments
<dt><br>
			<dd>* There is no conversion right under the Metropolitan Life Insurance Plan for Empire Plan enrollees who have existing coverage which would duplicate the conversion coverage or who are eligible for Medicare.
<dt><br>
<dt>Once continued coverage ends for any person, that person may obtain a personal health care (conversion) policy without evidence of insurability, as provided under the terms of the Plan.  Such a conversion right is not available for prescription drug coverage. Contact the Office of Human Resources for Conversion Policy addresses and telephone numbers.

<BR>
<BR>
<dt><A NAME="5B"><b>B</A>.	MEDICARE </b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA) requires the New York State Health Insurance Program to provide primary coverage for active employees under age 65 or their dependents under age 65 who are enrolled in Medicare due to a disability.  Medicare then becomes the secondary insurance carrier.
<dt><br>
<dt>An individual who reaches age 65 and meets Medicare requirements  must apply for Medicare coverage parts A & B, at a local Social Security Office, in order to receive full health insurance benefits.  To avoid the loss of Medicare benefits, the individual should enroll him/herself and dependents during the three month period preceding his or her 65th birthdate.  Detailed information is available at the local Social Security Office.
<dt><br>
<dt>For active employees age 65 and over who are enrolled in Medicare, the Empire Plan remains the primary insurance carrier and Medicare is the secondary carrier until the employee retires.
<dt><br>
<dt>When an employee becomes eligible for Medicare it is strongly advised that enrollment in Medicare Parts A & B be effected.

<dt><A NAME="5C"><b>C</A>.	PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAMS</b>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5C1"><i>1</A>.	PROGRAM FOR MANAGERIAL/CONFIDENTIAL EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEES REPRESENTED BY COUNCIL 82</b>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The Empire Health Insurance Plan has an associated co-pay prescription drug program through the State of New York (Value Rx) for eligible managerial/confidential employees that allows employees, dependents, and domestic partners to purchase prescription drugs from participating pharmacies at minimal cost.
<dt><br>
<dt>An employee obtaining prescription drugs from a participating pharmacy is responsible for the co-pay charge.  If such drugs are obtained from a non-participating pharmacy the employee must pay the full cost of the prescription.  Upon filing a claim form with the receipt of purchase the employee will be reimbursed, in general, an amount based upon standard prescription drug pricing guides minus the co-pay charge.  The difference between the non-participating pharmacy's charge and the amount reimbursed, in most cases, will be greater than the co-pay charge.  It is therefore to the employee's advantage to use a participating pharmacy.  The plan also has a Mandatory Generic Substitution Requirement.
<dt><br>
<dt>Eligibility, effective date of coverage, dependent eligibility, domestic partner eligibility, continuation in retirement, coverage while on leave of absence  without pay, loss of eligibility and termination of coverage is identical to the health insurance plan rules and regulations.

<dt><A NAME="5C2"><i>2</A>.	PROGRAM FOR ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES (UUP)</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Employees under the Professional Services Negotiating Unit who are eligible for enrollment in the Empire Health Insurance Plan have an associated co-pay prescription drug program through the UUP Benefit Trust Fund that allows employees and dependents to purchase prescription drugs from participating pharmacies with an associated co-payment.  The plan also has a Mandatory Generic Substitution Requirement.
<dt><br>
<dt>An employee obtaining prescription drugs from a participating pharmacy is responsible for the co-pay charge.  If such drugs are obtained from a non-participating pharmacy (or you do not have an ID card), the employee must pay the full cost and be reimbursed an amount no greater than the amount which would be paid to a participating pharmacy upon submission of a completed direct pay claim form.
<dt><br>
<dt>The effective date of coverage, dependent eligibility (except a legally separated spouse is not covered), domestic partner eligiblity, continuation in retirement, coverage while on leave of absence without pay and loss of eligibility is identical to the health insurance plan rules and regulations.
<dt><br>
<dt>Eligibility for benefits will terminate at the end of the           month following the month in which the employee last appears           on the payroll as an active state employee.

<dt><A NAME="5D"><b>D</A>.	HOME CARE ADVOCACY PROGRAM (HCAP)</b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>The Empire Plan's Home Care Advocacy Program (HCAP) started October 1, 1994.  HCAP is administered by Metropolitan.  When you call HCAP at 1-800-638-9918 and use an HCAP provider for medically necessary home care services and/or durable medical equipment/supplies prescribed by your doctor, you have a paid-in-full benefit for:
<dt><br>
	<dd>(a)	durable medical equipment/supplies
<dt><br>
	<dd>(b)	home nursing
<dt><br>
	<dd>(c)	home infusion therapy
<dt><br>
	<dd>(d)	certain home health care services when they take the place of hospitalization or care in a skilled nursing facility; home health aides; physical, occupational and speech therapy; prescription drugs; laboratory services.
<dt><br>
<dt>Call HCAP as soon as your doctor prescribes home care services and/or durable medical equipment/supplies.  Metropolitan will pre-certify medical necessity and then make or help you make the arrangements.  They will work with participating providers in your area.  If there are none, they will arrange for you to receive the pre-certified home care and/or equipment/supplies from a non-participating provider.
<dt><br>
<dt>After you call HCAP and your home care services and/or durable medical equipment/supplies are pre-certified as medically necessary, you may choose a non-participating provider that HCAP has not approved.  You will have out-of-pocket expenses.  The Empire Plan Basic Medical benefits will apply.  You must pay for the first 48 hours of private duty nursing per calendar year and meet your annual deductible.  You must submit a claim to Metropolitan.

<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E1"><i>1</A>.	PLAN FOR MANAGERIAL/CONFIDENTIAL EMPLOYEES (M/C)</i>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E1a">a</A>)	The Plan
<dt><br>
			<dt>New York State provides M/C employees with a group dental insurance plan, the Preferred Dental Plan, administered by Group Health Incorporated.  The entire cost of the coverage is paid by the State for eligible employees and dependents.  The plan covers a broad range of dental work.  If an employee chooses to use a participating dentist, all covered fees are paid by the plan.  If the employee chooses to use a non-participating dentist, reimbursement is made in accordance with a fee schedule based on a Statewide average.  The employee is responsible for any difference between the dentists' fees and the plan's payment schedule.  Coverage under this plan is automatic and is subject to certain deductibles.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E1b">b</A>)	Eligibility
<dt><br>
			<dt>The eligibility requirements for an employee, dependents, and domestic partners are the same as that for the health insurance program.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E1c">c</A>)	Effective Date of Coverage
<dt><br>
			<dt>Coverage under this Plan is effective on the first day of the month after an employee has completed six full calendar months of continuous employment.  The employee may have satisfied the six month period of employment in a non-eligible position.  In this event, the effective date is the first day of the month following the date of transfer to an eligible position.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E1d">d</A>)	The Deductible
<dt><br>
			<dt>There is an annual deductible, for all services except Preventative Care, Diagnostic Care and Orthodontics.  The deductible is $25.00 per person per calendar year.  The total family deductible will not exceed $75.00 per year for all covered family members.  The amount of the deductible is based on GHI's schedule, not on the amount charged by the dentist.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E1e">e</A>)	Expiration of Coverage and Leave Without Pay Status
<dt><br>
			<dt>Coverage in the Plan ends the last day of the month in which an employee is separated from active service with  his/her employer or is transferred from a unit or group eligible to participate in the Program.  In the event of death, your dependents' coverage terminates on the last day of the month in which your death occurs.  
<dt><br>
<dt>If you are placed in leave without pay status you may continue your coverage.  Payments of the full cost of coverage for this period must be made directly to the Office of Human Resources.
<dt><br>
<dt>If you do not make these payments, your coverage will cease on the last day of the month in which you were placed on leave without pay.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E1f">f</A>)	Cost
<dt><br>
			<dt>If you are employed by the State of New York, the State will pay the full cost of coverage for you and your eligible dependents. 
<dt><br>
<dt>If you are temporarily removed from the payroll, you may continue coverage while off the payroll by paying the full cost yourself.  Details are available from the Office Human Resources.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E1g">g</A>)	If You Leave State Service
<dt><br>
			<dt>If you leave State service, you may be eligible to continue your coverage through COBRA.  You must request continuation of coverage in writing within 60 days of the later of (1) the date coverage would otherwise end or (2) the date notice of your right to continue coverage is sent to you. (Please refer to the book "Preferred Dental Plan for You and Your Dependents" for more information.)
<dt><br>
			<dt>If you choose to continue your coverage through COBRA, NYS is required to offer you coverage which, as of the time coverage is being provided, is identical to the coverage provided under the plan to similarly situated employees or family members.  The law requires that you have the opportunity to maintain continuation of coverage for 3 years, unless you lost your group health coverage because of termination of employment or reduction in hours.  In that case, the required continuation coverage period is 18 months.  The law also provides that your continuation coverage may be cut short for either of the following reasons:
<dt><br>
			<dd>(1)	if NYS no longer provides dental insurance coverage to 	its employees<br>
			<dd>(2)	if the premium for your coverage is not paid on time.
<dt><br>
			<dt>You will have to pay all of the premium for your continuation coverage plus a 2% administrative fee.  You will have an initial grace period of 45 days starting with the date you choose continuation coverage to pay any premium; after the  initial 45 day grace period, you will have a grace period of at least 30 days to pay subsequent premiums.  COBRA also requires that at the end of the 18 month, 29 month or 3 year period, you are eligible to convert to a direct pay dental conversion contract.  If you choose COBRA, you must exhaust those benefits before converting to a direct-pay conversion plan.  If you choose COBRA and fail to make the payments or cancel coverage, you will not be eligible to convert to an individual policy.  Please contact the Office of Human Resources for additional information on COBRA.

<dt><A NAME="5E2a">a</A>)	The Plan
<dt><br>
			<dt>The United University Professions (UUP) provides employees under the Professional Services Negotiating Unit a dental program administered by the UUP Benefit Trust Fund.  The schedule of allowances provides payments according to a schedule of covered dental procedures which relate directly to the dentist's actual charges.  There are no deductibles which means eligible enrollee's receive first dollar coverage for their dental work and the cost of coverage is paid by the Benefit Trust Fund.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E2b">b</A>)	Eligibility
<dt><br>
			<dt>An employee eligible for enrollment in the State Health Insurance Program is eligible for dental benefits.

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E2c">c</A>)	Effective Date of Coverage
<dt><br>
			<dt>If you are a new employee in the PSNU, and you transferred directly from other State employment, you will become eligible for benefits on the day after the coverage under your previous plan terminates.  In all instances, you will not suffer a break in coverage.
<dt><br>
<dt>If you are a new employee in the PSNU, and you were not employed by the New York State Government immediately prior to your employment in the PSNU, you will become eligible for benefits following the completion of forty-two days of continuous service in covered employment.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E2d">d</A>)	Expiration of Coverage
<dt><br>
			<dt>Eligibility for benefits will terminate at the end of the month following the month in which you were last employed.
<dt><br>
<dt>However, if you are on authorized sick or disability leave without pay, your eligibility for benefits will terminate at the end of the fourth month following the month in which you were last employed.  A copy of your agency's sick or disability leave of absence without pay notice must be filed with the Fund Office before claims can be paid.  This will serve as certification of eligibility.
<dt><br>
<dt>Your enrolled dependents will lose eligibility at the same time that you do.
<dt><br>
<dt>You will again become eligible for benefits as soon as you have completed one full day of work, if you are re-employed within twelve months as an active employee in the PSNU and are eligible for State Health Insurance.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="5E2e">e</A>)	Continuity of Benefits
<dt><br>
			<dt>The dental benefits described above cease when you leave the UUP/PEBF group.  However, arrangements can be made to continue coverage on a Direct Payment basis or through COBRA for yourself or a dependent when he or she is no longer eligible.  The benefits provided will differ somewhat from Fund coverage.
<dt><br>
<dt>Upon request to the Fund, you will be furnished with the appropriate conversion applications and full instructions concerning continuation of dental coverage on a Direct Payment basis or through COBRA.
<dt><br>
<dt>Applications for continuation of coverage must be received within 30 days after your removal from the group.

<dt><br>
		<dt>Eligible M/C employees, their dependents, and their domestic partners are eligible for hearing care coverage under the M/C Hearing Care Plan.  The eligible enrollee must obtain medical clearance from an otolaryngologist prior to seeking any covered services.  The medical exam is required, but not covered under this plan. It may, however, be covered under the employee's health insurance plan.
<dt><br>
<dt>If recommended by the otolaryngologist, the employee next obtains an audiological evaluation (hearing test) from an audiologist.  The Plan reimburses up to $60 for this exam. If a hearing aid is recommended the employee proceeds to an audiologist for a hearing aid consultation to determine which aid is most suitable.  The Plan reimburses up to $70 for the consultation.
<dt><br>
<dt>The employee then purchases the aid or aids from an otolaryngologist, audiologist, or hearing aid dealer.  The plan provides up to $350 for one aid or $600 for two aids, if one aid is required for each ear.
<dt><br>
<dt>Plan benefits are available to each covered person once in each 45 month period and all covered expenses must be claimed on a single form.  The benefit enhancement for children under 12 years of age allows benefits to repeat after 24 months with prior written approval.

<dt><br>
<dt>Tier III members are entitled to receive either the benefits under  the Coordinated Escalator Plan (CO-ESC) or the benefits under the Coordinated Retirement Plan.  Members may not mix the provisions of the two laws to change the eligibility requirements for a benefit under either plan.  Once a Tier III member selects and begins to receive a retirement benefit, whether it be under CO-ESC or the Coordinated Retirement Plan, (s)he cannot change plans.  For example, if a Tier III member credited with less than 30 years of service retires at age 55 under the provisions of the CO-ESC Plan with its 30% reduction and its offset of Social Security beginning at age 62, the member is "locked in" to that benefit--(s)he cannot change to Coordinated Retirement Plan benefits at a later date.  (See below for further discussion of these benefits.)
<dt><br>
<dt>Tier IV members are only entitled to the benefits of the Coordinated Retirement Plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B7a">a</A>)	Funding (Contributions)
<dt><br>
	<dt>CO-ESC members must contribute 3% of their annual salary toward their retirement benefits during the period for which they accrue service credit.  Employers also contribute to the Retirement System on behalf of members.  These two sources together with investment income provide the money to pay retirement benefits.

<dt><A NAME="6B7c">c</A>)	Refunds
<dt><br>
			<dt>CO-ESC members cannot withdraw while they are employed as teachers.  If they stop teaching in a New York State public school or college they can only withdraw if credited with less than 10 years of service.  Upon withdrawal, they are entitled to a refund of their contributions with interest.

<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B7d">d</A>)	Service Retirement Eligibility
<dt><br>
			<dt>If prior to your present membership in the System you never were a member of any public retirement system in New York State, you will be eligible to retire at age 55 with a minimum of 10 years of service after July 1, 1973, or
<dt><br>
<dt>If you held a previous membership in a NYS public retirement system, you will be eligible to retire at age 55 with a total of 10 years of service, or
<dt><br>
<dt>If you attain age 70, you will be eligible to retire if you are credited with a minimum of five years of service.
<Dt><br>
		</dl>
<dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B7e">e</A>)	Benefit Calculation
<dt><br>
			<dt>For each year of credited service up to 20, you receive 1 2/3% of your final average salary.  If you are credited with 20 or more years of service, your allowance is computed at the rate of 2% per year, not in excess of 30 years, of your final average salary.  Final average salary is defined as the average of your highest three consecutive annual salaries (with certain limitations).
<dt><br>
<dt>The law requires a reduction based on age, as follows:
<br>
<center>
<table width=90%>
<tr><th align=left>RETIREMENT AT AGE</th>  <th align=left>% OF REDUCTION</th>  </tr>

<tr><td>61</td>                 <td>6.7%</td>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B7f">f</A>)	Deferred Retirement (Vesting)
<dt><br>
			<dt>If you have at least 10 years of credited service and you cease to teach in a New York State public school, you have vested rights.  Vesting enables you to receive a retirement benefit at age 55 or later.  Your benefit will be calculated the same as above.

<dt><A NAME="6B7g">g</A>)	Ordinary Disability Retirement
<dt><br>
			<dt>If you are credited with at least five years of service and are not eligible for a normal retirement benefit but are eligible for a primary Social Security disability benefit, you may be eligible for an ordinary disability benefit from the Retirement System.
<dt><br>
<dt>The ordinary disability benefit is computed at the rate of 2% per year of service up to 30 years.  It cannot be less than 33 1/3% of final average salary, minus 50% of any primary Social Security disability benefit and 100% of any workers' compensation payments.

<dt><br>
			<Dt>If you become disabled as the natural and proximate result of an accident on the job, not caused by your own willful negligence, and you are not eligible for a normal service retirement benefit but are eligible for primary Social Security disability benefits, you may be eligible for an accidental benefit from the Retirement System.
<dt><br>
<dt>The accidental disability payment is computed at the rate of 2% per year of service you would have been credited with had your employment continued until age 65, not in excess of 30 years, multiplied by your final average salary, minus 50% of any primary Social Security disability benefit and 100% of any workers' compensation payments.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<dt><A NAME="6B8f">f</A>)	Deferred Retirement (Vesting)
<dt><br>
			<dt>If you have at least 10 years of credited service and cease to teach in a New York State public school, you have vested rights. Vesting enables you to receive a retirement benefit at age 62.  Your benefit will be calculated the same as above, but in no event can it be less than the actuarial equivalent of your contributions plus interest.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B8g">g</A>)	Disability Retirement
<dt><br>
			<dt>If you are credited with a least 10 years of service and are determined by the Retirement System to be physically or mentally incapacitated for performance of gainful employment, you would be eligible for a disability benefit.
<dt><br>
<dt>If the Retirement System determines that you are disabled from the performance of gainful employment as the natural and proximate result of an accident not caused by your own willful negligence sustained in performance of your duties in active service while actually a member of the Retirement System, the requirement that you must have 10 years' credited service is waived.
<dt><br>
<dt>Coordinated Retirement Plan members under age 60 retiring for disability will receive a retirement allowance equal to 1/60 of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of credited service.  However, such members shall receive a minimum pension of the lesser of 33 1/3% of final average salary or 1/60 of final average salary multiplied by the total service the member would have rendered had (s)he continued in service to age 60.
<dt><br>
<dt>Members age 60 and older who meet the eligibility requirements for disability retirement will have their allowances computed on the same basis as a service retirement allowance.  However, in no event can such members receive more than they would under the disability calculation.
<dt><br>
<dt>The Application for Disability Retirement must be filed with the System within three months from the last date the member was being paid on the payroll, or within 12 months of the last date the member was being paid on the payroll if the member was on a leave of absence for medical reasons without pay during such 12- month period and was disabled at the time the salary ceased being paid.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12a">a</A>)	Tier I and II

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12ai">i</A>)	Eligibility
<dt><br>
				<dt>Any pre-July 27, 1976 member (i.e., Tier I and Tier II member) in active service or on leave of absence, under age 70, who has at least one year of service credit and who has at least $400 in accumulated member contributions (and interest) in the System may borrow from them once during each six-month period.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12aii">ii</A>)	Amount
<dt><br>
				<dt>The minimum loan is $300.  The loan amount cannot exceed the less of 75% of the member's accumulated contributions in the System or the total of principal and interest which can be repaid by age 70 by payments of 10% per year of the member's contract salary at the time the loan is issued.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12aiii">iii</A>)	Repayment
<dt><br>
				<dt>A loan must be repaid in equal monthly installments directly to the Retirement System, or through regular payroll deductions.  Direct repayment is required only during the 10 school months, September through June, although additional payments in multiples of the monthly installments may be made at any time.  Payment must be made at an annual rate of at least 2% of the member's contract salary and sufficient to repay the loan by age 70.                                

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12aiv">iv</A>)	Loan Forms
<dt><br>
				<dt>There are two loan application forms:

<dt><br>
<dt><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12aviiia">(a)</A>	5-Year Loan Application--This form has been distributed to employers and should be used exclusively for loans with repayment terms of five years or less.  The required monthly repayment on a "5-Year" loan may be substantial.  Inasmuch as the repayment amount cannot be reduced after the loan check is cashed, members should consider contacting the System prior to submitting the loan application to receive an estimate of the monthly repayment amount.

				</dl>
<dt><br>
<dt><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12aviiib">(b)</A>	5-Plus Loan Application--This form may only be obtained from the System's loan department.  Members requesting a 5-Plus Loan Application are automatically  provided with the approximate taxable amount of the loan to help them determine their potential federal tax liability should they choose to extend their loan payments beyond five years.
<dt><br>
<dt>If the loan application filed is complete and correct, eligible members are generally granted loans less than one week after the System receives the application.
</dl>
</dl>

<dt><br>
<dt>Interest is charged at the annual rate of 7%. (Interest rate is always 1% less than the System's valuation rate).
<dt><br>
<dt>Life insurance is charged at the annual rate of .10%.  Your loan is fully insured beginning 31 days from the date of issuance.  Once your loan is in default, insurance coverage ceases.
<dt><br>

<dt><br>
<dt>A charge of $2.00 is added to your loan balance for each delinquent payment.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dt><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12biii">iii</A>)	Loan Terms
<dt><br>
				<dt>Minimum loan is $1,000.

<dt><A NAME="6B13"><i>13</A>.	TRANSFERS</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Persons who hold valid memberships in two public retirement systems in New York State at the same time may receive credit in one system for the service rendered and credited in the other system through direct transfer.  For example, a member of the NYS Employees' Retirement System who changes jobs and joins this System may transfer credit from the Employees' Retirement System to the Teachers' Retirement System providing memberships in both systems are valid at the time of transfer.
<dt><br>
<dt>It is important to note that if a member is eligible to transfer and fails to do so and membership is terminated in the former system, then (s)he can never receive credit for that service.
<dt><br>
<dt>Once a transfer has been completed, the earlier of the membership dates in the two systems will be retained.  Purchase of prior service, explained above, does not change a person's membership date.

<dt><br>
	</dl>
<dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B14"><I>14</A>. INFORMATION ABOUT RETIREMENT</I>
<dt><br>
<dt>Annually each member receives a statement from the System containing updated information about his/her membership.
<dt><br>
<dt>Periodic newsletters and other publications are sent to members and school administrators.
<dt><br>
<dt>The System maintains a personal consultation service for members at selected locations throughout the State as well as at System headquarters in Albany.  Each fall consultation schedules are sent to the College and are available from the Office of Human Resources.
	</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B15"><i>15</A>.	SOCIAL SECURITY AND YOUR RETIREMENT PLAN</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Since 1957, teachers who are members of the New York State Teachers' Retirement System have been eligible for Social Security coverage.  Members in service in 1957, whose memberships have continued since then, are covered only if they elected coverage when it was offered.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Social Security coverage is mandatory for all other teachers upon joining the Retirement System.  A substitute or part-time teacher who desires Social Security coverage for teaching employment must first join the Retirement System.  Substitute or part-time teachers who do not join the System still must contribute to Medicare.


	</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B16"><i>16.	FILING FOR RETIREMENT</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>To initiate retirement, a member must file the proper form.  A retirement application must be on file with the Retirement System at least 30 but no more than 90 days before the date that retirement is to become effective.  The retirement application may be obtained from the System or the Office of Human Resources.  Decision regarding the form of allowance must be received by the last business day of the month in which the retirement is effective.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Many members have already filed acceptable proof of date of birth with the System.  For those who have not, an original or certified copy of any one of the following documents will serve as satisfactory proof: a birth certificate, a hospital record established during the first five years of  life certified by the custodian of the record, or a church baptismal record established during the first five years of life which shows the date of birth.
<dt><br>
		<dt>If one of the documents listed above is not available, then at least two of the following must be furnished: a school record from grade six or earlier, a church record, a state or federal census record, a bible or other family record, an insurance policy written at age 35 or before (applications for insurance are unacceptable), a marriage record, a passport, a military record, an immigration or naturalization record, a report of confidential social security benefit information (form SSA-2458) from the Social Security Administration.  Any of the foregoing documents must, of course, show the member's age or date of birth.

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6C1"><i>1</A>.	THE SYSTEM</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>A State retirement system which permits retirement at age 55 or thereafter.  Members who join after July 26, 1976 must complete ten years of creditable service after that date.  Credit is given only for time actually worked, i.e., faculty with an academic year obligation, even if paid on a 12-month basis, receive ten months of credited service.  Benefits are based on final average salary and years of full-time service.  A death benefit is provided as well as ordinary and accidental disability within minimum lengths of service.

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6C2"><i>2</A>.   MEMBERSHIP</i>
<dt><br>
          <dt>Membership includes employees of the State of New York and employees of those political subdivisions and public agencies of the State that have elected to become participating employers.

          <Dt>All permanent full-time employees (except those who are  members of the Teachers' Insurance Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund, State Policemen's and Firemen's  Retirement system, or State Teachers' Retirement System) must  join the New York State Employees' Retirement System.  Temporary, part-time, and seasonal employees may elect to  join the system, but any employee who wishes to be covered  by Social Security must join. 
<dt><br>
          <dt>The system is divided into four tiers.  Membership in each tier is generally determined by the date on which an employee was first           appointed to a permanent position in State service or last applied for membership.  Benefits are based on final average salary and years of service.

<dt><A NAME="6C4a">a</A>)  Service Retirement Eligibility
<dt><br>
              <dt>As a Tier I member of the New Career plan, you are eligible for retirement at age 55.  If you have recently changed employers, you may be required to complete 5 years of service with your new employer before you can retire under this plan.

<dt><A NAME="6C4d">d</A>)  Vesting
<dt><br>
              <dt>If you have 10 or more years of service credit upon leaving public employment (including 5 years as a Retirement System member), you have the right to a vested benefit.  This will entitle you to a retirement allowance when you retire, related to your previous years of government employment.
<dt><br>
              <dt>You can begin to receive a full vested benefit when you reach age 55. The amount of your vested benefit is frozen when you leave public employment and will not be increased by a delay in filing to receive it.
<dt><br>
              <dt>It is up to you to notify ERS when you become eligible for and ready to receive your benefit.  In order to receive your vested benefits at the earliest possible time, a retirement application must be completed and submitted before the first of the month following your 55th birthday.  Otherwise, your retirement will become effective on the date your application is received by the Retirement System.
<dt><br>

          <Dt>Tier III members are entitled to receive either the benefits under the Coordinated Escalator Plan (CO-ESC) or the benefits under the Coordinated Retirement Plan.  Members may not mix the provisions of  the two laws to change the eligibility requirements for a benefit under either plan.  Once a Tier III member selects and begins to receive a retirement benefit, whether it be under CO-ESC or the Coordinated Retirement Plan, (s)he cannot change plans.  For example, if a Tier III member retires at age 55 under the provisions of the CO-ESC Plan with its 30% reduction and its offset of Social Security beginning at age 62, the member is "locked in" to that benefit--(s)he cannot change to Coordinated Retirement Plan benefits at a later date.

<dt><br>
              <dt>Your final average salary is the average of the wages you earned during the 36 consecutive months which will provide the highest average wage.  If the wages earned during any year included in the 3-year period exceed the average wages of the previous 2 years by more than 10%, the amount over 10% will be excluded from the calculation.  If the 3-year period used immediately precedes retirement, any month or months (up to 12), during which you are on authorized leave of absence at partial or no pay, shall be excluded and an equal number of months immediately preceding the period shall be substituted.

              <dt>If you retire with fewer than 20 years of service, your normal service retirement benefit will equal 1/60th (1.66%) of your final average salary multiplied by your total years of service credit.
<dt><br>
              <dt>Your retirement benefit will be calculated without the CO-ESC Social Security deduction.  It will, however, be reduced by 1/15th (6.66%) for each of the first two years by which your retirement precedes age 62 and 1/30th (3.33%) for each year by which your retirement precedes age 60.

<dt><br>
              <dt>If the salary in any of the three years is more than 10% higher  than the average wage for the previous two years, the amount over 10% is not included in your final average salary.

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6C8d">d</A>)  Options
<dt><br>
              <dt>In addition to a maximum retirement benefit, with no provisions for a beneficiary, there are several options available which provide protection for a beneficiary.  The decision on an option must be made no later than the day before the effective date of retirement.

<dt><A NAME="6C8e">e)  Vesting
<dt><br>
              <dt>If you have 10 or more years of credited service and leave public employment, you have the right to a vested benefit.  This will entitle you to a retirement allowance when you attain age 62, regardless of the fact that you have left public employment.
<Dt><br>
              <dt>The vested retirement allowance is calculated in the same way as the service retirement benefit.  There is a guarantee, however, that the benefit cannot be less than the actuarial equivalent of  your contributions with interest.
<dt><br>
              <dt>Remember, you must notify us when you become eligible for and ready to receive your benefit.
<dt><br>
              <dt>In order to receive vested benefits at the earliest possible time, you should submit an application between 30 and 90 days before the first of the month following your reaching age 62.  Otherwise your retirement becomes effective on the date your  application is received by the System.

          </dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6C8f">f</A>)  Disability Benefits
<dt><br>
              <dt>If you are unable to perform your duties because of physical or mental incapacity, you may be eligible for one of the following  disability benefits whichever is greater.
<dt><br>
              <dd>- 1/60th of your final average salary for each year of  credited service or
<dt><br>
              <dd>- 1/60th of your final average salary for each year of service you would have earned if you had worked until you were 60.   The benefit in this case is limited to 1/3 of Final Average Salary.
<dt><br>
              <dt>If you think you are eligible, you or the Office of Human Resources may file an application for a disability benefit.  The application must be filed within three months of the last date you were paid on the payroll.  In the case of a medical leave of absence without pay, the application may be submitted within 12 months of your last paid service, provided you were disabled when the leave began and are on the leave when the application is filed.
<dt><br>
              <dt>Ten years of credited service are required in order to qualify for a disability benefit.  If your disability results from an on-the-job accident, not due to your own negligence, there is no minimum service requirement.  In order to qualify for your disability benefit, written notice of your accident must be filed with the Retirement System within 90 days of the accident, detailing the time and place of the incident, the particulars thereof, the nature and extent of your injuries, and your alleged incapacity.  The notice must be signed by your or someone acting on your behalf.

          </dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6C8g">g)  Contributions
<Dt><br>
              <dt>Coordinated Retirement Plan members must contribute 3% of their annual salary toward their retirement benefits.  Employers also contribute to the Retirement System on behalf of members.  These two sources together with investment income provide the money to pay retirement benefits.

          </dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6C8h">h</A>)  Refunds
<dt><br>
              <dt>If you terminate your public employment before vesting and before retirement, your contributions must remain on deposit with the System until you reach age 62 at which time you may  collect your contributions with 5% interest.  In the event of death before age 62, however, your contributions (plus interest at the rate of 5% per year, compounded annually) will be paid to your beneficiary unless a greater death benefit is payable.

<dt><br>
		<dt>A State employee entering active military duty is entitled to a leave of absence without pay while engaged in and going to and from military duty.  Such leave cannot exceed a cumulative total of four years of voluntary service.

	</dl>
 <dt><BR>

<dd><dl>
<dt>2.	<i><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="l2">FOR RESERVE MILITARY DUTY</A></i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>A State employee, who is a member of any reserve force, is entitled to 30 calendar (not work days) days per calendar year without charge to leave credits for time required for duty/training in the reserves.

<dt>M.	<b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="m">LEAVE FOR SUBPOENAED APPEARANCE AND JURY SERVICE</A></b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>On proof of necessity of jury service or attending court  pursuant to a subpoena or other order of the court, an employee shall be granted leave with pay without charge to leave credits.  Leave with pay for jury service or pursuant to a subpoena shall mean leave at the rate of pay the employee would have received had the employee not been on such leave.
<dt><br>
	<dt>Leave pursuant to a subpoena as described above does not apply to any absence by an employee if he/she is a party in such a proceeding.

</dl>
 <dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>N.	<b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="n">WORKERS' COMPENSATION LEAVE</A></b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>It is essential that an employee report any job-related accident immediately to his or her supervisor and to the Office of Public Safety.  Failure to do so could result in loss of benefits available to the employee for an absence due to an occupational injury.
<dt><br>
	<dt>Employees who incur an occupational injury or disease are eligible for benefits provided under the New York State Workers' Compensation Law and may be entitled to Workers' Compensation leave as provided in the State attendance and leave rules.  Under these rules, employees who are absent because of a job-related injury or disease may be granted up to 131 workdays of Workers' Compensation leave with pay without charge to leave credits, subject to a 15-day waiting period.  Subsequent absences may be charged to accumulated leave credits, sick leave, and leave without pay.  Leave beyond a cumulative total of one year is at the discretion of the College President.  A detailed explanation of the rights and responsibilities of employees wishing to avail themselves of these benefits is available from the Office of Human Resources.

</dl>
 <dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt>O.	<b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="o">EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION LEAVE</A></b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>Employee organization leave is leave with pay and without charge to the employee's leave credits.  The Agreement provides for the granting of employee organization leave for designated employees to attend UUP meetings, process grievances and participate in negotiations with the State.

<dt><br>
		<dt>All members of the professional staff are required to certify their presence on the Professional Staff Record of Attendance form.  Employees are also required to record on this form any charges to vacation, sick leave, and holiday time credits.  Such form is to be submitted on a monthly basis.

	</dl>
 <dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>2.	<i><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="p2">RECORD OF ATTENDANCE FORM</A></i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The Professional Staff Record of Attendance form used for recording absences, charges to leave credits and accruals of leave credits is distributed by the Office of Human Resources usually during the last week of each month.  The completed form signed by the employee and his/her immediate supervisor should be returned by the tenth of the month following the month being reported.

<dt>1.	<i><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="q1">UNAUTHORIZED ABSENCE</A></i>
<dt><br>
		<dt><BLOCKQUOTE>a)	Any employee absent from work without authorization shall be placed on leave without pay.  In the event an employee's unauthorized absence continues for ten consecutive work days and the employee has not provided a written explanation for such absence to the College President by the close of business of the tenth workday following the commencement of such unauthorized absence, the employee's leave without pay status shall continue for the remainder of the semester in effect on the tenth consecutive workday of absence where the College has hired a replacement for the employee.
<dt><br>
		<dt>b)	If the unauthorized absence without written explanation continues for a total of 30 consecutive workdays, the employee shall be deemed to have resigned from his/her position.
<dt><br>
		<dt>c)	If, prior to being deemed to have resigned from his/her position, an employee provides suitable medical evidence which substantiates a claim of temporary disability he/she may be placed on sick leave.  Any sick leave under this subdivision shall commence upon substantiation of the evidence.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	</dl>
 <dt>
<dt><BLOCKQUOTE>2.	<i><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="q2">ABSENCE:  EMERGENCY CLOSING OF STATE FACILITIES AND EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES</A></i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>State offices and other State facilities may be closed only by order of the Governor.  Local, government officials, police, radio and television stations do not have the authority to close State offices or facilities.  Presidents are authorized, however, to cancel classes and recommend that all but essential employees not report to work.
<dt><br>
		<dt>In the rare circumstance that the College is to be closed, the President will be so advised by System Administration through the Governor's Office of Employee Relations (GOER).  When the announcement is made that only essential service employees are expected to report to work, those people should make every effort to get to the College.  These would include physical plant, Public Safety, health service and other employees who are essential to maintaining the College's vital services.  Employees who work on these days will, of course, be marked present.  All others must charge the time to either personal leave, vacation or compensatory time.  Following certain snow emergencies the Department of Civil Service and the Governor's Office of Employee Relations may excuse the charge to leave credits.  This is usually granted only for severe multiple day closings, however, and is not automatic.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Notwithstanding the canceling of classes, no one who is able to get to work will be deprived of an opportunity to work.  Therefore, if  it is determined during the course of the day that the College cannot operate effectively, no employee will be required to leave at that moment.  The employee will however be permitted to leave then or any time thereafter.  Only the time that the employee is absent should be charged to leave credits.  An employee who does get to work may be advised that he/she cannot be guaranteed work at his/her normal work place.  It may be that the building in which the individual normally works is not open.  Provisions will be made for alternate campus work locations and alternate work for those who do get to the campus but who cannot go to their regular work places and cannot perform their regular work assignments.
<dt><br>
		<dt>However, an employee who has reported for work and, because of extraordinary circumstances beyond his/her control, for example extreme weather conditions or physical plant breakdown, is directed by the College President, or designee, to leave work, shall not be required to charge such directed absence during such day against leave accruals.  Any such release of employees shall not create any right to equivalent time off by employees who are not directed to leave work. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<dt>R.	<b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="r">LEAVE DONATION/EXCHANGE PROGRAM</A></b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>This is a pilot program providing for the donation of vacation leave credits to employees absent due to long-term personal illness.
<dt><br>
	<dt>The intent of this pilot program is to experiment with the concept of leave donation as a means of assisting employees, who because of long term illness, have exhausted all of their leave benefits as provided for in Sections 23.2 through 23.5 of the 1991-95 Agreement between the State and UUP, are subject to a severe loss of income during a continuing absence from work.  It is not the intent of this program to provide supplemental income which could result in compensation levels exceeding normal wages for employees, who have other means of substitute income, i.e., disability insurance program.
<dt><br>
	<dt>Donations may be made by UUP-represented employees to UUP-represented employees of the same campus who meet the following eligibility requirements:
<dt><br>
		<dt><BLOCKQUOTE>a)	are calendar year or college year employees eligible to accrue vacation leave credits pursuant to Section 23.2 of the 1991-95 Agreement between the State and UUP
<dt><br>

<dt><br>
		<dt>c)	are absent due to a non-occupational, personal illness or disability for which they have submitted (and continue to submit as requested) medical documentation satisfactory to management
<dt><br>
		<dt>d)	have exhausted all leave benefits as provided in Sections 23.2 through 23.5 of the 1991-95 Agreement between the State and UUP
<dt><br>
		<dt>e)	are expected to be absent for at least two biweekly payroll periods following exhaustion of all leave benefits as provided in Sections 23.2 through 23.5 of the 1991-95 Agreement between the State and UUP
<dt><br>
		<dt>f)	must not have had any disciplinary actions, or unsatisfactory performance evaluations within their last three years of State employment</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dt>
	<dt>Donations can be used in full or half day units upon exhaustion of all leave benefits as provided in Sections 23.3 through 23.5 of the 1991-95 Agreement between the State and UUP and prior to attaining eligibility to receive disability benefits under the University's Group Disability Insurance Program as specified in Section 23.8 of the 1991-95 Agreement.  After attaining eligibility to receive disability benefits in accordance with Section 23.8 of the 1991-95 Agreement, but prior to receipt of such benefits, donated credits may be used in full day units only.  Once an eligible employee begins receiving disability benefits under the University's Disability Program, donated credits may no longer be used. 
<dt><br>
	<dt>Donations can be made from vacation leave only.
<dt><br>
	<dt>Donations must be made in full-day units.
<dt><br>
	<dt>Leave Donation Exchange
<dt><br>
	<dt>The following provisions allow for UUP-represented employees to participate in the voluntary donation or receipt of accrued vacation credit with other bargaining units or M/C employees:
<dt><br>
		<dd><BLOCKQUOTE>a)	Vacation credits may only be donated, received, or credited between employees of the same campus who are deemed eligible to participate in an authorized leave donation program, provided that there are simultaneously in effect a Leave Donation Exchange Memorandum of Agreement between the Governor's Office of Employee Relations and the employee organizations representing both the proposed recipient and the proposed donor, or applicable attendance rules for managerial or confidential employees.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dt>
		<dd><BLOCKQUOTE>b)	The donations are governed by the provisions of the program applicable to the donor; receipt, crediting and use of donations are governed by the provisions of the program applicable to the recipient.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<dt>
S. <b><A NAME="s">VOLUNTARY REDUCTION IN WORK SCHEDULE PROGRAM (VRWS) - MANAGERIAL/CONFIDENTIAL EMPLOYEES (M/C)</A></b><BR>
<BR>
A Voluntary Reduction in Work Schedule (VRWS) program has been established for management/confidential employees (M/C).  In summary a full-time employee may reduce his or her work schedule by 30 percent or less and still be treated as full-time for attendance and leave purposes.<BR>
<BR>
The adjustment in salary must be made in minimum incriments of five percent, the smallest being one-half day's wages.  The corresponding adjustment in work schedule is accounted for by earning and charging a new category of accrued leave--Voluntary Reduction Credits (VR credits).  The participating employee and agency enter into a formal Voluntary Reduction in Work Schedule agreement, setting the terms and conditions of the program.  Guidelines and details are available in the Office of Human Resources.

Orientation occurs after admission and prior to matriculation.  All students (including freshmen, transfers and adult learners) who will be entering during the fall semester are invited to attend.  For mid-year matriculants, there is an additional session held just before classes begin in January.
<dt><br>
		<dt>The primary function of orientation is to assist students in their transition to the SUNY Potsdam environment.  A significant part of that process is working individually with an experienced academic adviser and selecting one's courses.  Other activities typically include discussions of graduation requirements, introductions to various academic and social policies, discussions of financial aid, meeting with the staff of such offices as Residence Life and developing familiarity with numerous College services.  In conjunction with the freshman sessions, there are also separate parallel parent orientation programs.  Orientation programs are coordinated by the Office of New Student Programs.

<dt><br>
			<dt>Students have many options as to living arrangements, including single room, double, or suite in co-ed or all-male or all-female facilities.  Special interest housing options compliment the residential program. The residence halls are staffed with professionals, paraprofessionals and upper-class students  who serve as Resident Assistants helping students adjust to college life and deal with various contemporary problems.  There is one Resident Assistant for every 25 students.

<dt><br>
<A NAME="10A7b">b</a>)	College Housing Policy
<dt><br>
			<dt>All students are required to live on campus until they have accumulated 88 credits toward graduation.  Students transferring to Potsdam are required to live for at least one year on-campus. Transfer students should contact the Residence Life Office as to their status.  Exceptions may be made for students living at home, for married students, and veterans on a case by case basis decided by the Director of Residence Life. 

<dt><br>
<A NAME="10A7c">c)	Programming
<dt><br>
			<dt>SUNY Potsdam is able to house approximately two-thirds of its students in residence halls on the campus.  While the primary purpose of these residences is obviously to provide students with a place to reside while pursuing their studies at the College, their existence presents a great opportunity to promote  a living/learning environment.
<dt><br>
			<dt>The existence of these accommodations has allowed SUNY Potsdam to become primarily a residential college.  The College views residential life as a fundamental component of the Potsdam educational experience.  Residences are not simply a convenient place to live, but, in the Potsdam context, are units in which the intellectual, social, and cultural development of students is promoted.  The Residence Hall environment can promote student development and learning throughout the institution.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Given this perception of the role of student residences, educational, social, and cultural programming is far more than an agreeable supplement to residence life.  Educational programming, particularly that which is integrated with academic units, is a crucial part of the residential experience.  Such programming should be diverse and varied and implemented in conjunction with academic units.  It should provide students with a choice of living situations, and it should stress the integration of campus life, curricular and co-curricular.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Residence Hall programming is developed in numerous ways.  Some programming originates with, and is implemented, by students.  Other programming is developed by faculty and staff, with the expectation that students will find this programming of benefit. The Residence Life staff experiments and takes original approaches to programming.  They study successful programs at other institutions and replicate them where appropriate.
<dt><br>
			<dt>While sound management practices and fiscal responsibility are essential, Residence Life is not be construed as a business or as a profit making venture.  Its main purpose is to advance the academic, intellectual, and social development of students and to assist in the achievement of the academic goals of the College.  
<dt><br>
			<dt>Stress is placed on the comfort of students and on the creation of a congenial living environment, and students are treated at all times as participants in rather than involuntary residents of the system.  To the extent possible, students have a share in the governance of residences and in the development of policies. They are consulted not only on programming but also on budgetary matters, including the establishment of room rental rates.  It is important to note, however, that extensive consultation does not mean the yielding of control:  the Office of Residence Life remains accountable to the institution both for the management of residences and also for the furtherance of the institution's academic goals.

<dt><A NAME="11A9">9</a>.	<I>EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (EAP)</I></a>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="11A9a">a</a>)	Purpose
<dt><br>
			<dt>The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is a confidential referral program which offers assistance to employees to cope with personal problems which negatively affect their lives and which might intrude upon their jobs.  Emotional stress, family disintegration, financial and legal difficulties, alcoholism, drug abuse and marital disruption impair not only an employee's personal life, but workplace productivity.  EAP was formed with the knowledge that such problems can be addressed and treated with appropriate help.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="11A9b">b</a>)	Service Provided
<dt><br>
<dt>EAP is a confidential information, support and referral service.  It is not a counseling service, nor does it provide treatment.  Using the referral services of EAP is not a condition of employment.  Depending upon the nature of the problem, employees seeking assistance are referred to a program, service or agency within the community for appropriate counseling or assistance.
<dt><br>
<Dt>Involvement in this program is entirely voluntary and services of EAP are free of charge.  Employee benefits may cover the expenses of other referral agencies.
<dt><br>
<dt>The SUNY Potsdam EAP office is located in Morey Hall, Room 105.  Employees calling EAP are not restricted to Potsdam coordinators.  Any EAP coordinator from any state agency can be contacted.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="11A9c">c</a>)	Eligibility And Referral
<dt><br>
			<dt>The EAP is open to all College and PACES employees, retirees and their families.  An employee may enter EAP through self- referral, supervisor referral, or a third party (family member, union representative, friend, co-worker, clergy, etc.)
<dt><br>
<dt>It is important to remember that the final decision to contact the Employee Assistance Program lies with the employee.  EAP is a voluntary option.
</dl>

<dt><br>
<dt>In addition to providing identification for security of buildings and facilities purposes, an I.D. card provides access to the use of College facilities, such as Maxcy Hall and Crumb Library.
<dt><br>
		<dt>The I.D. Office is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and no appointment is necessary.  There is no cost for the initial I.D. card, however, if the card is lost, a fee will be charged for the replacement.

<dt><A NAME="11A19"><i>18</a>.	TELEPHONE</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>It is the policy of the College to provide the most efficient and economical telecommunications system possible to support the operations of the College.  Telephone service is provided to the College community by an AT&T Definity G3R telephone switch.  Voice Mail is provided by an AT&T AUDIX System.
<dt><br>
<dt>The College presently utilizes AT&T as our long distance carrier.  This carrier requires the use of a seven digit authorization code to complete long distance, international and information calls.  Authorization codes are available from the office of Distributed Computing/Telemedia.    Personal authorization codes are available upon request, but require a supervisor's approval.  A supervisor may, at his/her discretion, restrict certain phones to campus or campus and local calls, only.
<dt><br>
<dt>Faculty and staff may request personal authorization codes by completing a Telephone/Network Services Request form.  This code will allow the individual to make personal calles from work and be charged for these calls.
<dt><br>
<dt>Our local calling area consists of the following exchanges:  262; 265; 267; 268; 322; 328; 353; 379 and 386.
<dt><br>
<dt>The telephone system is coordinated through the Office of Distributed Computing/Telemedia.  Please direct any questions regarding phone service to Brenda Bennett at extension 3000. 
<dt><br>
<dt>The following is a brief description of our most commonly used dialing patterns:
<dt><br>
		<dd>Local Calls:		Dial 9 followed by the complete seven digits of the number you are dialing.
<dt><br>
		<dd>On-Campus Calls:	Dial the last four digits.<br>
		<dd>(Includes Students)      
<dt><br>
		<dd>800 Calls:			Dial 9, then 1-800 and the last seven digits of the 800 number you are dialing. Authorization codes are not required to place 800 calls.
<dt><br>
		<dd>Long Distance Calls:	Dial 9-1, the area code (only if outside 315) and then the seven digits of the number you are calling, followed by your seven digit authorization code.
<dt><br>
		<dd>Information Calls:	Dial 9-1-Area Code-555-1212 and your seven digit authorization code.
<dt><br>

Agency funds are maintained by University-related organizations which have an established relationship with the State University of New York and/or its campus units.  These funds contain agency accounts.  Agency funds are resources held by a University-related organization in a custodial or fiscal agent capacity for the benefit of individual students, faculty or staff members, or appropriately recognized organizations and are not funds of the University-related
organization itself.

<dt><A NAME="12A5"><i>5</a>.	AIDS POLICY PROCEDURE</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is caused by Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus which may impair an individual's defense against infection thereby resulting in a complex of serious illnesses. AIDS virus is a fragile organism which will not easily survive outside a human host and is not easily spread from person to person except under very specific conditions relating to transfer of blood or semen.
<dt><br>
<dt>As an institution comprising over 4,000 individuals, Potsdam
College must be prepared to confront the possibility of this
disease on our campus.  The College policy on dealing with AIDS is written to conform to New York State and federal laws concerning confidentiality.
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>a)	SUNY Potsdam will follow the guidelines suggested by the American College Health Association.  Copies of these guidelines are on permanent file in the Crumb Library and Student Health Services.  They are available to all members of the college community.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
		<dt>b)	SUNY Potsdam's primary response to the threat of AIDS must be educational.  The College will conduct ongoing educational programs, designed to reach all members of the college community and to teach them about:
<dt><br>
<dd>1.	the nature of AIDS and means by which it is transmitted;
<dt><br>
<dd>2.	how to protect oneself and others against possible infection;
<dt><br>
			<dd>3.	how those infected with AIDS should prevent transmitting the disease;
<dt><br>
			<dd>4.	where individuals can receive testing and treatment for the disease;
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
		<dt>c)	Any college employee informed by another employee that he/she has AIDS must hold that information confidential.  The right of confidentiality is protected by law.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
		<dt>d)	Individuals who have AIDS may need special accommodations or restrictions.  Each case must be determined on an individual basis.  These determinations must be made according to the type and extent of the disease. Determinations will be made when permission is received from the individual with AIDS to release medical information.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
		<dt>e)	Those who wish AIDS testing will be referred for testing and counseling as provided by the State Health Department and AIDS Task Force.  The College Student Health Service will provide an information sheet regarding AIDS testing indicating the nature of the test.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
		<dt>f)	In the event of inquiries directed to the College by either the media or other members of the public concerning the incidence of AIDS on campus, the response will be that "We will neither confirm nor deny the incidence of AIDS on campus."
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
		<dt>g)	Information about AIDS is available at all times at Student Health Service.

<dt><A NAME="12A6"><i>6</a>.	ALCOHOL POLICY</i>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A6a">a</a>)	Statement of Purpose
<dt><br>
			<dt>SUNY Potsdam recognizes that a responsible attitude towards the use of alcoholic beverages is a desirable goal and should be encouraged by College policy.  These regulations are to act as guidelines to provide members of the College community with an opportunity to develop a realistic and reasoned approach to alcohol use.  They presume adherence to New York State Law and respect for the rights of all others in the College community.  It is important to note that college policy does not recognize misuse of alcoholic beverages as an excuse for misconduct of any kind.
<dt><br>
<dt>The SUNY Potsdam Alcohol Regulations apply to all members of the College community and their guests.  They are in effect for all campus buildings and the College grounds.  They are meant to provide a framework through which responsible use of alcohol is a prime objective.  

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A6b">b</a>)	State and Local Alcohol Regulations

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A6bi">1</a>)	New York State Law
<dt><br>
				<dt>New York State has taken major steps to deal with alcohol abuse.  The penalties for "Driving While Ability Impaired" and "Driving While Intoxicated" have increased substantially (including fines, suspension or revocation of license, imprisonment.)  The best advice:  <B>if you drink, don't drive.</B>             
<dt><br>
				<dt>It is a crime in New York State to purchase alcoholic beverages for, or to give alcohol to, a person under 21 years of age.  The legislature has passed several bills to substantially increase penalties for these offenses. 
               <dt><br>
<dt>Effective December, 1985, the minimum legal age for purchase of alcoholic beverages became 21.  The College must comply with State law.
<dt><br>
<dt>Effective October, 1989, a person under the age of 21 who presents an altered New York State driver's license for the purpose of illegally purchasing an alcoholic beverage may be subject to a suspension of that driver's license for up to 90 days and may also be required to apply to the Department of Motor Vehicles for a restricted use driver's license following the suspension.
<dt><br>
<dt>Effective November, 1989, persons under the age of 21 who present falsified or fraudulently altered proofs of age for the purpose of purchasing or attempting to purchase alcoholic beverages are guilty of a violation.
<dt><br>
<dt>Effective January, 1990, persons under the age of 21 are prohibited from possessing any alcoholic beverage with intent to consume the beverage.  Alcoholic beverages involved in alleged violations of this law may be seized by authorized law enforcement officials, including campus public safety officers.

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A6bii">2</a>)	Civil Liability
<dt><br>
				<dt>General Obligations of New York State Section 11-100 provides for civil liability against any person knowingly causing intoxication of a person under 21 years of age by furnishing alcoholic beverages to that person or by aiding such a person in procuring alcoholic beverages.  Section 11-100 (Dram Act) provides for civil liability against any person selling or procuring alcoholic beverages for an intoxicated person regardless of age.

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A6biii">3</a>)	Village of Potsdam
<dt><br>

			<dd>-	Misconduct on College property resulting from the use of alcohol constitutes a violation of these regulations which may result in penalty as set forth in Article VI.
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	Possession of any alcoholic beverage by a person under the age of twenty-one (21) is expressly forbidden.
<dt><br>

<dt><br>
			<dd>-	"Possession" shall not include possessing alcoholic beverages pursuant to a person's employment responsibilities.
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	Any violation(s) of these regulations shall be dealt with in accordance with Article VI.
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	Alcoholic beverage restrictions are determined by the policy governing the type of area in which alcohol is to be involved (i.e. Thatcher Hall, residence hall room) rather than the type of event (i.e. party, function).

<dt><br>
				<dd>(b)	Reasonable amounts of solid, substantial food and non-alcoholic beverages must be available.  Guideline:  one case of soda (or equivalent) per 1/2 keg of beer.

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A6ei">1</a>)	Individual:
<dt><br>
	<dd>(a)	Possession and use of alcoholic beverages in residence halls is governed by New York State law and College policies.  Possession of any alcoholic beverage by a person under the age of twenty-one (21) is expressly against this policy.

<dt><br>
				<dd>(b)	No multiple quart/liter containers of alcoholic beverages nor any containers of alcoholic beverages with/or requiring taps are allowed in student rooms at any time.  Amounts of alcoholic beverages available in student rooms need to be reasonable and prudent from the perspective that this policy tries to promote responsibility if there is consumption of alcoholic beverages and which recognizes the rights of roommates and other residents of the residence hall.  The time to ascertain what is a reasonable and prudent amount of alcoholic beverages for a gathering is before that gathering.  This can only be done through discussions with professional Residence Life staff.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A6eii">2</a>)	Residence Hall Party Regulations:
<dt><br>
				<dd>(a)	Parties involving alcohol in designated areas of   the residence halls must be registered in advance at the quad office using the registration authorization form.
<dt><br>
				<dd>(b)	Parties planned and/or sponsored by individuals, non-official organizations or official organizations must petition the Residence Hall Director for permission to use residence hall facilities.  Problems with organizations may be referred for administrative action.
<dt><br>
				<dd>(c)	The Residence Hall Director may, in consultation with hall government and the Student Life Coordinator, refuse permission if in his/her judgment the rights of residents will be abridged by the granting of permission.  The details of refusal must be forwarded to the Director of Residence Life.
<dt><br>
				<dd>(d)	Cost of repairs for any damage resulting from the use of alcoholic beverages will be assessed against the party sponsor(s) according to the provisions of the residence hall license.
<dt><br>
				<dd>(e)	No multiple quart/liter containers of alcoholic beverages nor any containers of alcoholic beverages with/or requiring taps are allowed at residence hall parties from midnight Sunday through 5:00 pm Friday.
<dt><br>
				<dd>(f)	All parties are to be supervised by a member of the professional staff, an R.A., or by members of the hall government.  The number of Control Agents required shall be determined by the appropriate Director(s) according to the size of the party.  Control Agents and designated supervisors shall not consume alcohol at the party.
<dt><br>
				<dd>(g)	Any registered party may be held only in designated areas jointly proposed by Residence Life, Public Safety and the Board of Alcohol Review.
<dt><br>
				<dd>(h)	Residence Life staff has the right to regulate the number of functions on any given night in each residence hall.  No scheduled functions are permitted after 1:00 am.  All requests must be registered and approved in advance with the hall government and the Residence Hall Director.
<dt><br>
				<dd>(i)	A gathering is considered to be a small, informal group of individuals and requires no prior approval.  When a gathering has the potential for exceeding the capacity of the room or suite by  numbers of people or noise, it is considered to be a party and requires prior approval.  For guidelines related to capacity of an area, contact a Residence Life professional.

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A6f">f</a>)	Application Procedure
<dt><br>
			<dd>1)	Sale of Alcohol
<dt><br>
				<dd>The only group that may sell alcohol on the College premises is PACES (by contract with the State University of New York).  The only areas licensed for regular sale of alcoholic beverages are the first floor of the Student Union, Thatcher Hall, and the Student Union Patio (certain areas within the buildings are excluded).  All other areas require that PACES purchase a one day caterer's permit from the New York State Liquor Authority (through the St. Lawrence County Alcoholic Beverage Control Board).  This requires 2-3 weeks; the cost of this permit will be passed on to the sponsoring group.  NOTE:  Alcohol to be consumed on the first floor of the Student Union patio and Thatcher Hall must be provided, sold and controlled by PACES.  Requests for use of alcohol on the 2nd floor of the Student Union are subject to approval and controls established by the Director of the Student Union & Activities.  It is a violation of the New York State liquor law to bring alcoholic beverages into a licensed facility.

(For outdoor areas, Director of the Student Union & Activities.)  Alcohol orders will not be processed by Dining Services without an approved form.
<dt><br>
<dd>Catering events including alcoholic beverages to be served in PACES leased facilities will be authorized by the Director of Dining Servcies, or designee, in consultation with the apprpriate building administrator.<BR>
<BR>

<dd>Procedures:

</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 0 -->
	I.	EMPLOYEE EXPOSURE DETERMINATION
<dt><br>
		<dt>OSHA requires employers to perform an exposure determination concerning which employees may incur occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials.  The exposure determination is made without regard to the use of personal protective equipment (i.e. employees are considered to be exposed even if they wear personal protective equipment).  This exposure determination is required to list all job classifications in which all employees may be expected to incur such occupational exposure, regardless of frequency.  At this college the following job classifications are in this category:
<dt><br>
	<dd>Campus Public Safety Officer<br>
	<dd>Supervising Campus Public Safety Officer<br>
	<dd>Director of Public Safety<br>
	<dd>Supervisor of College Nursing Services<br>
	<dd>Nurse I<br>
	<dd>Director of Student Health<br>
	<dd>Licensed Practical Nurse<br>
	<dd>College Physicians Assistant<br>
	<dd>Athletic Trainer<br>
	<dd>Laboratory Supervisor
<dt><br>
<dt>In addition, OSHA requires a listing of job classifications in which some employees in these categories would be expected to incur exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials, tasks or procedures that would cause these employees to have occupational exposure are also required to be listed in order to clearly understand which employees in these categories are considered to have occupational exposure.  The job classifications and associated tasks for these categories are as follows:
<dt><br>
<center>
<table>
	<tr><th>Job Classification</th>         <th>Tasks/Procedures</th></tr>
<tr></tr>
	<tr><td>Cleaner/Janitor</td>             <td>Laundry, Cleaning in</td></tr>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
	III.	METHODS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND CONTROL
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt>1.0	Universal Precautions
<dt><br>
		<dt>1.1	As of March 6, 1992, all employees will utilize Universal Precautions.  Universal Precautions is an infection control method which requires employees to assume that all human blood and specified human body fluids are infectious for HIV, HBV, and other bloodborne pathogens (see Appendix A) and must be treated accordingly.
<dt><br>
		<dt>2.0	Exposure Control Plan (ECP)
<dt><br>
		<dt>2.1	Employees covered by the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard will receive an explanation of this ECP during their initial training session.  It will also be reviewed in their annual refresher training.  All employees will have an opportunity to review this Plan at any time during their work shifts by contacting the Pyscical Plant Office.  Employees seeking copies of the Plan may contact the Physical Plant Office.  A copy of the Plan will be made available free of charge and within 15 days of the request.
<dt><br>
		<dt>2.2	The Environmental Health and Safety Office will also be responsible for reviewing and updating the ECP annually or sooner if necessary to reflect any new or modified tasks and procedures which affect occupational exposure and to reflect new or revised employee positions with occupational exposure. 
<dt><br>
		<dt>3.0	Engineering Controls and Work Practices		
<dt><br>
		<dt>3.1	Engineering controls and work practice controls will be used to prevent or minimize exposure to bloodborne pathogens.  The specific engineering controls and work practice controls we will use and where they will be used are contained in the Student Health Exposure Plan and include:
<dt><br>
<dt>-	puncture-resistant disposal containers for contaminated sharps, or broken glass
<dt><br>
			<dt>- 	providing readily accessible hand washing facilities
<dt><br>
			<dt>- 	washing hands immediately or as soon as feasible after removal of gloves                                        
<dt><br>
			<dt>-	washing body parts as soon as possible after skin contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials occurs, prohibiting the recapping or bending of needles
<dt><br>
			<dt>-	labeling
<dt><br>
			<dt>-	prohibiting eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or lip balm and handling contact lenses in work areas where there is a likelihood of occupational exposure
<dt><br>
			<dt>-	prohibiting food and drink from being kept in refrigerators, freezers, shelves, cabinets or on counter tops or bench tops where blood or other potentially infectious materials are present
<dt><br>
			<dt>-	requiring that all procedures involving blood or other potentially infectious materials shall be performed in such a manner as to minimize splashing, splattering, and generation of droplets of these substances
<dt><br>
			<dt>-	new technology for needles and sharps will be evaluated and implemented whenever possible to further prevent accidental needle sticks and cuts.  Our engineering controls (i.e., sharps containers, etc.) will be updated as needed by the Student Health Services every year.
<dt><br>
		<dt>4.0	Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
<dt><br>
		<dt>4.1	Personal protective equipment must also be used if occupational exposure remains after instituting engineering and work practice controls, or if controls are not feasible.  Training will be provided by the Supervisor in the use of the appropriate personal protective equipment for employees' specific job classifications and tasks/procedures they will perform.
<dt><br>
<dt>Additional training will be provided, whenever necessary, such as if an employee takes a new position or if new duties are added to her/his current position.
<dt><br>
<dt>Appropriate personal protective equipment is required for the following tasks; the specific equipment to be used is listed after the task:
<dt><br>
<center>
<table>
               <tr><th>Task</th>                                     <th>Equipment</th></tr>
<tr></tr>
<tr><td>First Aid, Emergency Response, </td>   <td>Gloves, Lab Coat, Clinic</td></tr>
<tr><td>Routine Health Care</td>    <td>Jacket, Protective Eye-wear, <br>Face Shield, Surgical Gown, <BR>
Mouth to Mask Device</td></tr>
<tr><td>Laundry/Cleaning of Contaminated Items</td>  <td>Gloves</td></tr>
			</table></center>
<dt><br>

</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>-	Wear appropriate gloves when it can be reasonable anticipated that you may have contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials and when handling or touching contaminated items or surfaces.  Replace gloves if torn, punctured, contaminated, or if their ability to function as a barrier is compromised.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>-	Following any contact of body areas with blood or any other infectious materials, you must wash your hands and any other exposed skin with soap and water as soon as possible.  Employees must also flush exposed mucous membranes (eyes, mouth, etc.) with water.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>-	Wear appropriate face and eye protection such as a mask with glasses with solid side shields or a chin-length face shield when splashes, sprays, spatters, or droplets of blood or other potentially infectious materials pose a hazard to the eye, nose, or mouth.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>-	If a garment is penetrated by blood and other potentially infectious materials, the garment(s) must be removed immediately or as soon as feasible.
</dl>
<Dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>-	Repair and/or replacement of PPE will be at no cost to employees.

		<dt>6.0	Hepatitis B Vaccination
<dt><br>
		<dt>6.1	A Health Care Professional will provide information on Hepatitis B Vaccinations addressing its safety, benefits, efficacy, methods of administration and availability.  A general overview of these considerations is given in Appendix L for review.  The Hepatitis B vaccination series will be made available at no cost within 10 days of initial assignment to employees who have occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials unless:
<dt><br>
<dd>-	the employee has previously received the series<br>
<dd>-	antibody testing reveals that the employee is immune<br>
<dd>-	medical reasons prevent taking the vaccination; or<br>
<dd>-	the employee chooses not to participate
<dt><br>
<dt>All employees are strongly encouraged to receive the Hepatitis B vaccination series.  However, if an employee chooses to decline HB vaccination, then the employee must sign a statement to this effect. 
<dt><br>
<dt>Employees who decline may request and obtain the vaccination at a later date at no cost.  Documentation of refusal of the HB vaccination (see Appendix C1) will be kept in the Human Resources Office with the employee's other medical records.
<dt><br>
<dt>Appendix C will be used to record the employee vaccination series information.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>7.1	Should an exposure incident occur contact the supervisor immediately.  Each exposure must be documented by the employee on an "Exposure Report Form" (see Appendix D).  The supervisor will add any additional information as needed.
<dt><br>
<dt>An immediately available confidential medical evaluation and follow- up will be conducted by a health professional.  The following elements will be performed:
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	Document the routes of exposure and how exposure occurred.
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	Identify and document the source individual (see Appendix E), unless the employer can establish that identification is infeasible or prohibited by State or local law (see Note #1).        
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	Obtain consent (see Note #2) and test source individual's infectivity and document the source's blood test results.
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	If consent cannot be obtained from source individual, a record will be made of the declination.
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	If the source individual is known to be infected with either HIV or HBV, testing need not be repeated to determine the known infectivity.
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	Provide the exposed employee with the source individual's test results and information about applicable disclosure laws and regulations concerning the source identity and infectious status.
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	After obtaining consent, collect exposed employee's blood as soon as feasible after the exposure incident and test blood for HBV and HIV serological status.
<dt><br>
			<dd>-	If the employee does not give consent for HIV serological testing during the collection of blood for baseline testing, preserve the baseline blood sample for at least 90 days. (see Note #3).
<dt><br>
			<dt>Appendix D "Exposure Incident Report" and Appendix E "Request For Source Individual Evaluation" and Appendix F "Employee Exposure Follow-Up Record" (see Note #4) will be provided to the employee so they may bring them along with any additional relevant medical information to the medical evaluation.  Original copies of these appendixes will be maintained with employee's medical records.    
<dt><br>
<dt>The Director of Student Health Services will review the circumstances of the exposure incident to determine if procedures, protocols and/or training need to be revised to prevent similar incidents in the future.

<dd><dl>
<A NAME="12A10"><i>10</a>.	BOMB THREAT</i>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>THE MOST important concern in any threat to campus property or people is to provide quick and orderly safety to all concerned.  Secondary but also important is the clarity with which campus functions will proceed while under the emergency procedures.  Guidelines for bomb threats are as follows.
<dt><br>
<dt>1.	The Director of Public Safety will determine the need for closing one or more buildings or events.
<dt><br>
		<dt>2.	At the point a building is closed or event is terminated an attempt will be made to suggest the duration, i.e. "closed for the day," or "postponed until ________."
<dt><br>
		<dt>3.	The Director of Public Safety will, in conjunction with the Assistant Vice President for Facilities, post notices on the building and, if appropriate, identify where continued information and services can be forwarded. "Class information will be available in the Barrington Union" or "____________ services will be provided in _________________ ."
<dt><br>
		<dt>4.	The Director of Public Safety will notify the Provost, Vice President for Student Life, the Office of Human Resources, and the Director of College Relations who will in turn notify appropriate services and teaching units.		
<dt><br>
	<dt>5.	All personnel not instructed by the above will report to the Office of Human Resources.
<dt><br>
		<dt>6.	In the event Dunn Hall and main switchboard cannot be the communication center, emergency phones will be established in Barrington Student Union.
<dt><br>
		<dt>7.	Director of College relations will serve as primary media contact. 
<dt><br>
		<dt>*** Any employee receiving a threatening call should immediately call Public Safety at *2222..  Special attention to such as the following are crucial:  Sex of caller, background noise, type of "bomb" and any location specifics.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<dt><A NAME="12A11"><i><BLOCKQUOTE>11</a>.	BUILDING ADMINISTRATOR:  POLICIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</i>
 <dt><br>
		<dt>Each academic building on the SUNY Potsdam campus shall have a building administrator, preferably a person already residing in that building.  The building administrator shall be appointed by the President of the College after appropriate consultation.  He/she shall be willing and able to assume the position and all associated responsibilities.  The appointee shall be a full-time member of the faculty, professional or administrative staff of the College.  He/she shall serve for a period of one year, the appointment to be made at the beginning of the Fall semester and be renewable each year thereafter.  The building administrator is the chief administrator in charge of his/her building at the direction of the President of the College and is ultimately responsible for the well-being of the facility.  The building administrator will have the authority to make decisions and carry out those duties which affect comfort, convenience, safety and energy conservation.  In this regard, the building administrator will work closely with the Offices of Physical Plant, Public Safety and his/her building custodians.  The building administrator's name, office and telephone numbers and official building hours shall be prominently posted in the main lobby of his/her building.
<dt><br>
<dt>Specifically, the building administrator shall:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
<dt>a)	Perform his/her responsibilities in a competent, positive and timely fashion.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>b)	Be authorized to delegate selected responsibilities associated with the position to one or more individuals in that building with the understanding that the building administrator is ultimately responsible for decisions or policies made regarding use of the facility.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>c)	Make regular tours of his/her building making sure that all equipment and facilities essential to good work/study practices are in proper working order.  All irregularities that cannot be taken care of by the regular building custodians shall be referred to the  building administrator.  He/she shall then prepare a work order and send it to the Office of Physical Plant for action.  (A written record of such findings will be kept by the building administrator.)

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>d)	Shall be notified of and act on all requests to use facilities after normal working hours or on weekends making sure that such utilization does not violate College policies.  All approved requests must have written authorization from the building administrator. All requests for keys must also have his/her written authorization.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>e)	Accompany Public Safety, Physical Plant representatives and state inspectors on all scheduled safety and fire prevention tours.  The building administrator shall make certain that all potentially dangerous situations and particularly those conditions that affect the handicapped are immediately referred to the appropriate administrative office.  He/she shall also make certain that necessary information recorded during fire drills is submitted to the Office of Public Safety.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>f)	Be notified of all accidental occurrences in his/her building and keep a record of such.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>g)	Be apprised in advance of all activities regarding structural modification, scheduling pesticide spraying or changes in College policies which might affect building usage.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>h)	Act on requests to use audio-visual hardware and other equipment already under the supervision of the building administrator.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>i)	When requested, meet with the Environment Advisory Committee for the purpose of providing input on matters of safety, comfort and energy conservation.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>j)	Serve as a member of a group of all building administrators, this group to constitute the Council of Building Administrators to be convened by the President of the College or designee at the beginning of the Fall semester.  At this time, the President will officially appoint building administrators and discuss responsibilities and policies.
          <dt><br>

	<dt><A NAME="12A12"><i><BLOCKQUOTE>12</a>.	BUILDING USE</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Building use by any individual or organization must be recognized by the campus as educationally oriented and non profit in nature.  Student organizations must be recognized by the Student Government Association; Faculty and Staff organizations recognized by the College administration, and non-College affiliated users approved by the President or his/her designee.  (Director of Continuing Education.)

<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt><A NAME="12A12a">a</A>)	Use by College Affiliated Group - Building use by any College affiliated group or individual is approved by the individual building administrator and related directly to the scheduling of the spaces within the facility involved.  General instructional space on campus such as classrooms, lecture halls, etc. are scheduled by the Office of the College Registrar.  Specific dedicated instructional spaces are normally scheduled either by the academic unit involved and/or the building administrator.  In each case, the building administrator is aware of the scheduled use of all such direct instructional spaces within the building over which he/she has jurisdiction.  Therefore, the single contact with the building administrator provides the necessary input as to the availability of the space for which the use is requested.  It is the building administrator's responsibility to check with any academic unit to ascertain whether they have scheduled prior use of any such space, in addition to that shown on the class schedule.  Forms for building use are sent to building administrators

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt><A NAME="12A12b">b)	Use By Non-College Affiliated Groups -  All use of facilities by any non-College affiliated group or individual is channeled through the President's designee, Director of Continuing Education. That person bears the responsibility to insure that the requested use meets the required criteria, then contacts the building administrator involved to ascertain whether the space is available for the intended purpose.  A standard form exists for all such requests for use of space by non-College affiliated groups or individuals.  Any prolonged use in excess of thirty days requires prior approval of the Central Office of the State University and State Comptrollers Office.  Use of space for less than 30 days requires approval of the President of the College or his/her designee.  Long term use requires the completion of a revocable permit.  The short term use is handled locally and approved by the President, while the long term use requires formal presentation through Central Administration of State University and the Comptrollers Office and becomes a comprehensive and complex document. Use of all space on campus is based on a priority system.  
<dt><br>
			<dt>The direct needs of the academic program take the highest priority followed closely by student and staff activities.  Other scheduled activities that relate to the total College program receive the next priority.  Other requested uses by College or non-College affiliated individuals or organizations are then considered.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<dt><A NAME="12A13"><i><BLOCKQUOTE>13</a>.	NAMING OF BUILDINGS AND GROUPS AND ROOMS WITHIN A BUILDING</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The College President, Executive Director of the  Potsdam College Foundation, nominator and/or donor will initiate the confidential process of naming.  The President may inform and involve the Executive Staff and other college administration as appropriate.  The College President will appoint a screening committee as needed to review any naming requests.
<dt><br>
<dt>The screening committee will review the nominee's contributions and qualifications relative to the mission and spirit of the college and the SUNY guidelines.  The committee is authorized to consult with appropriate campus offices and constituencies in this process.  Upon completion of the review, the committee will make a recommendation to the President.
<dt><br>
<dt>The President, after review and consideration, may forward the recommendation to the College Council or may terminate the recommendation.
<dt><br>
<dt>The College Council will forward its recommendation to the Chancellor for the SUNY Trustees, or may terminate the recommendation.
<dt><br>
<dt>Upon approval from the SUNY Board of Trustees, the President may release information and/or initiate ceremonies as deemed appropriate.

<dt><br>
The naming should honor an individual, group, organization or political subdivision that has definable and significant connections with the College's history, academic programs, student life, research, public service or advancement efforts.
<dt><br>
<dt>The naming should enhance a visitor's ability to identify, locate and use an area of the campus.
<dt><br>
<dt>An additional name for a building shall incorporate a functionally-related name whenever possible - i.e., Crumb Library, Crane School of Music.
<dt><br>
		<dt>GENERAL UNDERSTANDINGS
<dt><br>
			<dt>Buildings or grounds may be named for individuals (living or deceased) and/or organizations, with the primary criteria of dedicated support of and commitment to the enhancement of SUNY Potsdam, its mission and its efforts.  Each situation is judged on its own merit, taking into account significant contributions of personal service as well as monetary or in-kind gifts.
<dt><br>
<dt>Naming for gifts (cash or in-kind): consideration should be given to previous contributions, the purpose of the gift and the proportional relationship of the gift to the project for which it is intended.
<dt><br>
<dt>Naming an existing building:  this implies a significant contribution of the donor both in terms of size and relationship to the original or renovated cost and purpose of the building or facility as well as significance for the future.
<dt><br>
	<dt>DEFINITION OF TERMS
<dt><br>
			<dt>Outstanding service (above and beyond the call of duty) to the college includes excellence as an employee or an individual serving in a voluntary capacity; scholarly contributions; college service.
<dt><br>
<dt>Prominence refers to the overall reputation in the local area or elsewhere with a record of substantial contributions to society - for example, in education, environment, public service.
<dt><br>
<dt>Substantial gift includes the nominee's ongoing affiliation with and financial support for the college combined with a reputation for quality and caring on campus and in the community.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<dt><A NAME="12A15"><i><BLOCKQUOTE>15</a>.	COMPUTING CODE OF ETHICS</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Every user of SUNY Potsdam's computing facility has the fundamental right to privacy and is entitled to a fair share of resources.  It is unethical for any user to violate these principles
<dt><br>
<dt>Each usercode and associated password belong to an individual.  All use should be in accordance with SUNY Potsdam policy on computer use set forth in this document.  Owners accept the burden for the responsible use of their usercode.
<dt><br>
<dt>Electronically-stored files are presumed to be private and confidential unless the owner has explicitly made them available to the public.
<dt><br>
<dt>Use of the network or electronic mail facilities for transmitting anonymous, rude, abusive, harassing or malicious messages is unethical.
<dt><br>
<dt>The unauthorized copying of any software that is licensed or protected by copyright is theft and thus unethical.
<dt><br>
<dt>Although SUNY Potsdam's computing systems and network are not invulnerable to deliberate abuse, knowledge of a special password or any weaknesses in the established security systems should not be used to deliberately degrade SUNY Potsdam's computing systems, its network, personal computers, nor deprive other users of the resources of any SUNY Potsdam or individually-owned computer.
<dt><br>
<dt>When necessary for the maintenance of a system network, SUNY Potsdam Information Services Personnel may restrict availability of shared resources.  It may also be necessary to look at a user's file to follow up on reported problems.
<dt><br>
<dt>Use of computer resources is a privilege, not a right, and is granted with restrictions and responsibilities for their use.  Misuse of College computer resources can result in their revocation.      
<dt><br>
<dt>Use of resources associated with college computer accounts for direct financial gain (e.g., commercial consulting) is unethical.    
<dt><br>
<dt>Violation of the Computing Code of Ethics may subject a user to disciplinary action.
<dt><br>
<dt><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="e-mail">ELECTRONIC MAIL</A> (EMAIL)
<dt><br>
<dt>Obtaining an Email Account (usercode)
<dt><br>
			<dt>In order to use electronic mail at SUNY Potsdam it is necessary to have an email "account" or usercode for each user.  This prevents anonymous mail and establishes the electronic address for each email user to which electronic mail can be received from other email users on or off campus.  Each email account is protected, in part, from unauthorized access by requiring the use of a unique password to identify the legitimate user.
          <dt><br>
<dt>Any student, faculty or staff member of SUNY Potsdam identification may request an email account.  While SUNY Potsdam does not prohibit the use of email for personal           reasons, users should be informed that the primary intention
of providing email service is to support the educational mission of the college and the conduct of its daily business.
<dt><BR>

<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
		<dt>Postmaster Responsibilities for Email
<dt><br>
		<dt>It may be necessary at times for the local SUNY Potsdam email postmaster to read an electronic mail message which has failed to reach its destination in order to determine, if possible, the intended addressee and redirect the message to the correct address.  However, it is otherwise not the practice of the postmaster to read or to discuss the content of any message.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>Privacy of Email
<dt><br>
		<dt>It is impossible to ensure the confidentiality of any electronic messages stored or communicated through our computing facilities.  As pointed out by other universities, "The privacy of electronic mail is somewhere between that of a letter and a postcard."  While confidentiality cannot be ensured, all email is considered private and confidential. Except as noted under Postmaster Responsibilities for Email above, email is not to be read by computing center staff or any others with sufficient computer system privileges to do so.
         </dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt>Hierarchy of Communication with Email
<dt><br>
		<dt>Email is a person-to-person form of electronic communication, addressed to a specific individual and does not adhere to any chain of command in its delivery.  Anyone may write to anyone.
<dt><br>
<dt>Ethics of Email
<dt><br>
		<dt>The SUNY Potsdam Computing Code of Ethics applies to email.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>1<A NAME="12A16">6.  CONFINED </A>SPACE</I><BR>
<BR>
SUNY Potsdam has established guidelines and operational instructions to be taken by campus personnel in order to provide a safe work environment for its employees when entering confined spaces.

	<dt><A NAME="12A18g">g</A>)	Applying For Permission To Reproduce Copyrighted Materials

<dt>The Association of American Publishers has issued these recommendations for faculty members requesting permission to reproduce copyrighted materials:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
<dt>i)	Request all permissions for a specific project at the same time.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
			<dt>ii)	Do not ask for a blanket permission for all of the material.  It complicates the request.  Often it cannot be granted.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
			<dt>iii)	Send a photocopy of the copyright page and the pages for which permission is being requested along with your application.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
			<dt>iv)	Be sure to enclose a return address with your request.
</dl><!-- 2 -->
<dt><br>
			<dt>Publishers receive these requests every day.  Provided the requests are presented in proper order, they usually grant them quickly and efficiently.

<dt><br>
			<dt>Exit interviews serve a worthwhile function as an "informational exchange" tool.  The employee can be informed as to the procedures for continuing benefits, returning state property, payment of vacation accruals, withdrawal of retirement contributions, obtaining final paycheck, etc.  The employer can benefit by exploring feelings about job satisfaction in an effort to identify training needs, lack of competitive salaries, fringe benefits, promotional opportunities, identify the need for organizational change or areas with unique demands and frustrations, identify soundness of personnel selection process or problematic supervisory styles, and create goodwill, among other things.

<dt><A NAME="12A25"><I>25.	FACULTY UTILIZATION POLICY</I>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The policy of SUNY Potsdam on faculty utilization reflects the criteria of the Board of Trustees of the State University of New York for the evaluation of academic employees (Policies of the Board of Trustees, Article XII, Title A) and the practice which has been in effect for many years at the College.
          <dt><br>
<dt>While the primary responsibility of full-time faculty at SUNY Potsdam is academic instruction, other responsibilities include, but are not limited to, academic advising, research and/or creative activities, continuing professional development, and campus and community service.
<dt><br>
<dt>Full-time faculty at SUNY Potsdam normally carry 12 semester hours each semester.  These 12 semester hours are not limited to standard classroom teaching, but may include contact with students in credit-bearing lab sections, research seminars, and other learning modes.  Responsibilities are not determined on the basis of student load (i.e., a professor who teaches one or more large sections is not automatically given a course load reduction).  Low-enrolled courses (e.g., fewer than 12 students in a lower division course; fewer than
9 students in an upper division course) are reviewed by the dean for possible cancellation and substitution of a higher demand course.  Some faculty also teach tutorials and direct research projects for a few students.  Schedules are reviewed before and after pre-registration to assure the effective use of faculty resources while allowing the continuation of courses that are essential to major or other programs.
<dt><br>
<dt>Currently, variations on the normal expectations of teaching load are determined by the Deans, the Provost and, in some cases, by the President.  Faculty may apply for a course reduction for research and other scholarly activity through the Department and the Department Chair to the Dean's office.  Such applications state the purpose of the reduction and carry with them the recommendation of the Department and the Department Chair.  Decisions on requested reductions are made by the Provost in consultation with the appropriate dean.  
<dt><br>
<dt>In addition to the reduction granted for department chairs, a reduction in teaching assignment may be granted for such reasons as:
<dt><br>
<dd>--	Administrative assignments (e.g., chair of the Faculty Assembly)<br>
		<dd>--	Research and other scholarly activity, as noted above,<br>
		<dd>--	Chair of a major search committee;<br>
		<dd>--	Extraordinary community service.
<dt><br>
		<dt>All full-time faculty are expected to submit an annual report of their activities.  The reports are reviewed by the deans and, in the case of decisions regarding merit pay, reappoint-ment, promotion and the granting of continuing appointment, by the Provost and the President.  Faculty are evaluated, promoted, and receive merit pay increments on the basis of teaching effectiveness, mastery of subject matter, scholarly ability, effectiveness of university service (including advisement of students), public service, and continuing growth.
<dt><br>
<dt>The assessment of faculty utilization is an on-going process.  As stated in the Faculty Handbook "It is the responsibility of the Deans in consultation with the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Department Chairs to develop instructional programs which will result in reasonably equal service to students, the College, and the State of New York from each member of the teaching faculty."  Specifically, the Provost conducts periodic reviews of faculty utilization for each academic department, including an analysis of enrollments, number of majors, general education needs, student/faculty ratios, and SUNY benchmark information.  When vacant lines are available, they are reallocated to different departments in such a way as to maximize the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of the overall academic program.

<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
<dt><A NAME="12A26a">a</A>)	Possession Of Firearms And Weapons
<dt><br>
			<dt>The rules of the Board of Trustees prohibit the possession of firearms or weapons on a State operated campus of the State University of New York without the written authorization of the campus President (or designee).  The Director of Public Safety has been appointed as the President's designee for such purpose.  The fact that a person is in possession of a valid New York State pistol permit does not authorize that person to have a firearm or weapon on campus without such written authorization of the campus President (or designee).
<dt><br>
<dt>Such authorization may be rescinded at any time but in no event shall it be valid for longer than one academic year.
<dt><br>
<dt>Persons who are designated peace officers under authority of the Education Law are not exempt from the firearms licensing requirements of the penal law.  Neither are they exempt from prosecution for possessions of noxious substances.

		</dl><!-- 2 -->
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
<dt><A NAME="12A26b">b</A>)	Storage Of Firearms And Weapon
<dt><br>
			<dt>All firearms and weapons authorized by the campus President shall be stored unloaded in an appropriately locked arsenal under the control of the Public Safety department.

		</dl><!-- 2 -->
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
<dt><A NAME="12A26c">c</A>)	Procedure
              <dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	All faculty, staff and students bringing firearms or weapons to campus must first report directly to the Office of Public Safety to have them properly stored.                   The office is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>ii)	Permission to store the firearms or weapons should then be obtained from the appropriate person.

<dt><A NAME="12A27"><i>27</A>.	FIREWORK DISPLAYS</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>In order to insure the compliance by the College with municipal, state and federal laws, the Director of Public Safety will be responsible for the coordination of all campus firework displays.  Organizers of such displays should accordingly contact the Director of Public Safety for details well in advance of organizing a display.

	</dl><!-- 1 -->
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
<dt><A NAME="12A28"><i>28</A>.	GIFTS AND GRATUITIES</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The acceptance of any gift, gratuity, or rewards by an employee from a person or persons with whom she/he does business is forbidden.  If such gifts are received, they must be returned.  The State University employee must adopt an attitude and mode of operation that is above criticism and avoid any type of conduct that would reflect unfairly on the employees of the State University as a whole.

<BR>
The purpose of the New York State Right To Know Law and the Federal Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) is to ensure that workers are informed about all toxic substances produced or used in the workplace and how to protect themselves from physical and health hazards.  The rights afforded to employees by the State and Federal laws include the following:<BR>
1.  The right to notice and information regarding all hazardous chemicals present on the work site.<BR>
2.  The right to refuse to work with a substance if a request for information regarding that substance has not received a response.<BR>
3.  The right to review employee exposure records maintained by SUNY.<BR>
4.  The right to training.<BR>
5.  The right to recourse through the New York State Attorney General or the Department of Labor in the event an employee's rights have been violated.<BR>
<BR>
The Hazard Communications Standard requires manufacturers and suppliers to provide a material safety data sheet (MSDS) for each chemical that is distributed.  Employers are required to mintain a MSDS for each hazardous chemical present on the job site.  The MSDS will provide all safety handling and hazard information for that particular substance.<BR>
<BR>
The MSDS is an integral part of the Right To Know Program.  You should refer to it before handling any chemical and whenever the need arises.<BR>
<BR>
The Hazard Communication Standard calls for the development of a system of labeling for containers of hazardous materials.  Each label must contain the following:  the name of the chemical, the name and address of the manufacturer, and an appropriate hazard warning.<BR>

<dt><br>
			<dt>Library materials borrowed by students and community residents are due 28 days following the day that they are signed out or at the end of the semester, whichever comes first.  SUNY Potsdam faculty loans are due 120 days following the day that they are signed out.  For all borrowers, maps and videos are due 2 days after they are signed out.  All periodicals are library use only.
               <dt><br>
			<dt>Any library material may be recalled before the due date at the request of another borrower.  Failure to respond to a recall notice will result in a fine of five dollars plus one dollar for each additional day up to a maximum recall fine of fifty dollars per item.

Materials borrowed by faculty are due 5 days after they are first signed out.<BR>
<BR>
<dt>Procedures concerning recalls, overdues, and renewals are similar to those established for regular circulating materials.<BR>

<dt><br>
				<dt>Non-circulating materials include records, compact discs, cassette and open-reel tapes, video recordings,
periodicals, reserve materials, restricted materials,

		<dt><A NAME="12A33"><i>33</A>.	MAINTENANCE AND PUBLIC ORDER</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>With respect to public assemblies, SUNY Potsdam will observe and implement the SUNY Board of Trustees' policy entitled "Rules and Regulations for Maintenance of Public Order on Premises of State-Operated Institutions of the State University of New York."  Copies of this document are on file in the Crumb Library and are available from the Office of the Assistant Vice President for Student Development, 105 Barrington Student Union.
<dt><br>
<dt>This policy specifies that each campus communicate these rules to the college community and adopt and promulgate procedures for giving reasonable notice and details of any planned assembly, picketing, or demonstration on the grounds or in buildings of the institution.  To this end, the following local procedures and guidelines are in effect at SUNY Potsdam.
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
<dt>a)	Definitions
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->

<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
<dt>i)	Any notification of such activities involving SUNY Potsdam facilities shall be made on the form provided by the College and must be on file at least three (3) working days in advance of the activity.

<dt>If unusual or unforeseen circumstances prevent observance of the three day notification period, it shall be the responsibility of the person(s) organizing the activity to notify the appropriate designee and to complete appropriate forms at least four (4) hours before any activity begins.  In addition, if the use of specific campus buildings, equipment, or other property will be used in connection with the planned activity, it is the responsibility of the sponsoring organization to obtain permission to use such campus facilities through the normal channels specified in existing College policies.  These policies require that use of a College facility by any College affiliated group must be obtained from the individual building administrator responsible for that facility.  All requests to use College facilities by any non-    College affiliated group must be submitted to the     Office of Continuing Education.
<dt><br>
			<dt>ii)	In addition to the conduct specified in the Board of     Trustees' policy section 535.3, no activity may:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 4 -->
<dt>(a)	amplify sound that interferes with class activity, College activities, or that is in violation of Village ordinances or other ordinances,
<dt><br>
				<dt>(b)	modify or alter College facilities without permission from the College.
</dl><!-- 4 -->
<dt><br>
			<dt>iii)	Revocation or withdrawal of permission to use a College facility may occur at any time due to unforeseen operational problems, or for violation of the above section ii).
<dt><br>
<dt>If, in the judgment of College officials, an activity is not consistent with the intended purposes as specified in the notification form, or the activity has been misrepresented, permission to use the College facility shall be withdrawn and the activity in progress shall be halted.  
<dt><br>
			<dt>iv)	The use of College facilities does not imply the College's endorsement of the purposes or views of the sponsors of the activity in question.

	<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->

	<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt><A NAME="12A40d">d</A>)	Printing Services
<dt><br>
			<dt>There are three primary printing options for reproducing publications at SUNY Potsdam.  Those options and their respective capabilities follow:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	Duplicating
<dt><br>
				<dt>Duplicating<br>
				<dt>Sizes to 11" x 17" <br>
				<dt>Bond, offset, and card stock<br>
				<dt>Colored paper is available and NCR<br>
				<dt>Black ink only<br>
				<dt>Folding, collating, stitching, and plastic binding      
<dt><br>
			<dt>ii)	Central Print Shop (SUNY Canton)
<dt><br>
				<dt>Duplicating and offset printing<br>
				<dt>Over 200 copies<br>
				<dt>Sizes to 11 x 17"<br>
				<dt>Bond, offset, cover and card stock and fine papers available in a variety of colors<br>
<dt>Single and multi-color printing <br>

<dt>Printing large areas of solid color<br>
<dt>Four-color process (color photos)<br>
<dt>Large quantities<br>
<dt>Large format
<dt.<br>
			<dt>In most instances, the nature, the budget, and the intended audience of the publication will determine how it is to be designed and printed.  The staff in the Office of College Relations will choose how best to get the job done.
<dt><br>
<dt>If it is a job which requires simple duplicating, the timeliness of delivery and the quantity required will affect the decision as to where the job is printed.  This decision is to be made by the Duplicating staff.
</dl><!-- 3 -->
</dl><!--2 -->
	<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt><A NAME="12A40e">e</A>) Publication Requests
<dt><br>
<Dt>To initiate an external publication to be produced by the Office of College Relations, you must file a Publication Request Form.  This form provides the basic information necessary to begin production planning.  It will also allow for prioritizing the publication in order to schedule the annual workload.
<dt><br>
<dt>Publication Request Forms are sent to all departments in April.  At this time, you are asked to project your publications needs for the following year (July 1 - June 30).
<dt><br>
<dt>If for some reason, the office is unable to handle your request, the staff will suggest alternative methods for having the publication produced.
<dt><br>
<dt>Of course, there are always unanticipated needs; the office will try to accommodate these needs on a time-available basis.  Publication Request Forms for these unscheduled publications are available throughout the year in the Office of College Relations.  You should file one as soon as you know your need.

		</dl><!--2 -->
	<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt><A NAME="12A40f">f</A>)	Funding For Publication
<dt><br>
			<dt>The Publications budget in the Office of College Relations provides for only the major recruitment and development publications of the College.  All other publications are funded through the originating departments.  Please be sure to include the amount you have budgeted for your publication and the account number to which it will be charged when you complete the Printing Publication Request Form.

		</dl><!--2 -->
	<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt><A NAME="12A40g">g</A>)	Recruiting Publications (Admissions)
<dt><br>
			<dt>All publications intended to be used for admissions recruiting must first be reviewed and approved by the Director of Admissions and the Director of College Relations.

		</dl><!--2 -->
	<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt><A NAME="12A40h">h</A>)	Production Services
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	Planning and Advising
<dt><br>
				<dt>The staff of the Office of College Relations is involved in planning printing on a daily basis.  Consulting with the office as soon as you know that you will be producing a publication will save you time, energy and money.
<dt><br>
			<dt>ii)	Time and Cost Estimates
<dt><br>
				<dt>The staff will evaluate your proposed publication, determine the printing option that best suits your needs, and provide time and cost estimates. 
<dt><br>
			<dt>iii)	Editing
<dt><br>
				<dt>The staff provides editorial support.  However, you are responsible for preparing original copy.  Guidelines for the preparation of copy are available in the Office of College Relations.  Following these guidelines will expedite the production of your publication.
<dt><br>
			<dt>iv)	Typesetting
<dt><br>
				<dt>Computerized typesetting for most publications is done in-house.  Copy submitted for publication should be on disk in Microsoft Word or Word Star with an attached hard copy.  
<dt><br>
			<dt>v)	Proofreading
<dt><br>
<dt>While due caution is exercised in typesetting, typographical errors do occur.  Ultimately, it is the client's responsibility to ensure that the typeset matter is free from errors.  You will be asked to proofread your copy and to sign off on corrections throughout the production process. 
<dt><br>
			<dt><br>vi)	Design
<dt><br>
				<dt>Do not try to design your publication in advance.  Experienced graphic designers will design a publication that will effectively communicate the intended message while maintaining the College's publication standards.
<dt><br>
			<dt>viii)	Expediting
<dt><br>
				<dt>If your publication is to be printed in Duplicating, it is your responsibility to see that the Duplicating Job Request is properly filled out and that the job is taken to Duplicating.  If the job is to be printed at the Central Print Shop (SUNY Canton), the designer assigned to the job will fill out the Duplicating Job Request and expedite production.  If the job is to be printed by an outside vendor, your designer will coordinate (through Purchasing) production of the publication.

		<dt><A NAME="12A40i">i</A>)	State Printing Regulations
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	Bidding
<dt><br>
				<dt>All printing purchased from outside vendors is closely regulated by statute and monitored by the Office of General Services and the Office of the State Comptroller.  Most of the printing performed by outside vendors requires competitive bidding.  Printing orders in excess of $2,500 require sealed bids.  The bidding process can take from thirty to sixty days, depending on the estimated dollar amount of the order.

<A NAME="12A"><b>A</a>.	CAMPUS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</b>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A41"><i>41</A>.	PURCHASING</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>In order to comply with State University's basic procurement objective to secure the most appropriate materials, supplies, equipment, services, etc. at the lowest available price, consistent with quality requirements and delivery needs as will best promote the interests of New York State, the following guidelines have been developed:
<dt><br>
<dt>The College's Purchasing Department is charged with the centralized purchasing of all supplies and materials for the campus for the most effective and economical acquisition of products and services with consideration for the benefits of quantity buying, standardization of materials and equipment, the reduction of expensive emergency buying, the use of competitive bidding and the development of new sources of supply to aid in obtaining advantageous prices and achieve maximum use from allocated funds.  The office works with      faculty and staff to determine and implement effective purchasing for specialized and all other instructional research needs, subject to rules and regulations set by the State.
<dt><br>
<dt>The Purchasing Department is responsible for the College's compliance with all State and local purchasing rules, regulations and procedures and, as such, all purchases must be initiated by the Purchasing Department.  All requests for supplies and/or equipment to be purchased from State funds must be submitted directly to the Purchasing Department on the standard requisition form.  It is suggested that individuals retain a copy of each request for their records.  A separate requisition must be completed for each individual source or vendor.  All requisitions must be properly signed.  
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt><A NAME="12A41a">a</A>)	State Contract Items
 <dt><br>
			<dt>The Office of General Services issues state contracts each year for a large number of commodities.  The College is required by law to purchase said supplies and/or equipment from the state contract vendor unless it can be proven that the same item (make and model) can be purchased cheaper from another source.  Individuals should contact the Purchasing Department to obtain      information regarding source, price, delivery and contract items.
<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41b">b</A>)	Non-Contract Items
<dt><br>
			<dt>Commodities not available under centralized contracts may be purchased directly by the College in accordance with State rules and regulations.  It is the policy of The State University of New York to take affirmative action to ensure that minority and women-owned business enterprises (MWBE) are given the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to provide the College with goods and services at competitive prices.  The Purchasing Department maintains a file by vendor and commodity which is available for individual use.  Campus procedures for purchasing non-contract items provide for
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	a review for purchase from minority and/or women-owned business, and preferred sources.
<dt><br>
			<dt>ii)	a review for purchases of similar commodities from the same vendor within the previous sixty (60) days
<dt><br>
			<dt>iii)	a vendor of choice with no competitive bidding and a review for a reasonable price for purchases under     $500
<dt><br>
			<dt>iv)	solicitation of prices and a review for a reasonable price for purchases from $500 up to $2500
<dt><br>
			<dt>v)	solicitation of a minimum of three (3) bids (verbal, written or sealed) for purchases in excess of $2500 and up to $5000
<dt><br>
			<dt>vi)	solicitation in writing of a minimum of five (5) sealed bids for purchases in excess of $5000 and up to $10,000
<dt><br>
			<dt>vii)	minimum of five (5) sealed bids for purchases in excess of $10,000 and up to $20,000.  In addition, notification to all bidders on SUNY/Campus bid list for the particular commodity OR insertion in the New York State Contract Reporter is required.
<dt><br>
			<dt>viii)	consultation with the Office of General Services (OGS), minimum of five (5) sealed bids and insertion in the New York State Contract Reporter for purchases in excess of $20,000. 
<dt><br>
			<dt>ix)	solicitation of a minimum of five (5) bids (written or sealed) for all printing requests up to $10,000, with printing requests in excess of $10,000 requiring prior approval of the Controllers Office.
</dl><!-- 3 -->
<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41c">c</A>)	Storehouse
 <dt><br>
			<dt>Storehouse items must be submitted on a separate requisition and prices should be verified against the College storehouse stocklist before submission.  The College storehouse list should also be checked before requesting merchandise from other sources.
<dt><br>
		<dt><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="12A41d">d</A>)	Bookstore Purchases
 <dt><br>
			<dt>Before purchasing items at the Campus Bookstore, individuals should verify with the Purchasing Department whether the merchandise is already in stock or covered by State contract.  Bookstore personnel will issue an invoice indicating your departmental appropriation number and total cost.  This should be submitted immediately to the Purchasing Department on the standard requisition form.
<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41e">e</A>)	Equipment
 <dt><br>
			<dt>All equipment purchased by the College must be entered immediately into the equipment inventory.  No equipment may be removed, relocated, or in any other way be disposed of without the prior written approval of the Office of Physical Plant.
<dt><br>
<dt>All requests for repairs to any State owned equipment must be processed through the Purchasing Department.
<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41f">f</A>)	Service Contracts
 <dt><br>
			<dt>Service Contracts are required for any service rendered in a fiscal year that exceeds $5000.  This includes typewriter maintenance, piano tuning, linen rental, non-credit instructors, installment or lease purchases, etc.  The procedures governing these contracts are lengthy and may require up to ninety days lead time.  Details and guidelines are available from the Office of Business Affairs.  
<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41g">g</A>)	Library Acquisitions
<dt><br>
			<dt>Expenses charged to Library acquisitions are initiated by the Library and are not subject to the above regulations.  Expenses chargeable to Library S&E must, however, still follow the stated regulations.

		<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41h">h</A>)	Monetary Limitations and Responsibilities
 <dt><br>
			<dt>The State Finance Law requires that bids be solicited for all requests in excess of $2500.  Depending on the commodity and the monetary value, different procedures are followed.  For further clarification, please check with the Purchasing Office.
<dt><br> 
<dt>The State Finance Law expressly states that no purchase liability shall be incurred except by issuance of a purchase order.  Merchandise ordered and received without the issuance of a purchase order becomes the personal obligation of the individual ordering.  Authority is lodged solely in the Purchasing Agent to create any financial obligation between the College and any other party.  This applies to purchases, memoranda of understanding, agreements, contracts or any other      document resulting in payment of funds by the College.
 <dt><br>
<dt>Faculty and staff are cautioned that the law of Agency applies to any transaction improperly entered into without authority in which case the individual is personally liable for any and all payment(s) due other parties.

		<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41i">i</A>)	Receiving
 <dt><br>
			<dt>Central Receiving is responsible for verifying that all state and non-state contract items purchased with state funding are physically received.  All items delivered to the College must be sent directly to Central Receiving.  All hand carried orders or yellow book authorizations picked up by College employees must be taken to Central Receiving for proper identification.  Exceptions to this rule may require Central Receiving staff to go out into the field to inspect shipments of goods which for one reason or another were unable to pass through Central Receiving.  Repairs will be verified by appropriate departmental supervisors.

		<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41j">j</A>)	Emergency Purchases
<dt><br>
			<dt>State University Purchasing and Contracting procedures (Procedures Manual Item 300) defines an emergency purchase as follows:
<dt><br>
	<dt>"An emergency purchase must involve an accident or unforeseen occurrence requiring immediate action; it is       unanticipated or fortuitous; it is a sudden or unexpected occasion for action and involves a pressing necessity.  The conditions must be such that unless corrected without delay, death, injury or serious property damage would result.  Where such conditions exist, the waiver of competitive bidding requirements must be approved in writing by the campus President or appropriate designee to provide for adequate internal control."
<dt><br>
			<dt>All emergency situations must be documented in writing by the designee.  The President's designee for determining emergency situations is the Director of Business Affairs.

		<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A41k">k</A>)	Purchasing From College Employees
 <dt><br>
			<dt>Item No. 4, Section 73 of the Public Officers Law states:
<dt><br>
				<dt>"No officer or employee of a state agency, member of the legislature or legislative employee or firm or association of which such person is a member, or corporation, ten per cent or more of the stock of which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such person, shall sell any goods or services having a value in excess of twenty-five dollars to any state agency unless pursuant to an award or contract let after public notice and competitive bidding (emphasis added).
<dt><br>
			<dt>In accordance with the above, the purchase of goods or services in excess of $25 from College employees can only be made as a result of a competitive bidding process.

<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A42"><i>42</A>.	REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION POLICY</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="ADA">The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</A> of 1990 mandates that employers make reasonable accommodations for otherwise qualified employees with disabilities, unless it can be demonstrated that providing such accommodations would result in undue financial or operational hardships.  To date, most employee requests for reasonable accommodations under both the ADA and its antecedent, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, have been addressed directly by the employee's supervisor or department chair.  While department chairs and supervisors are encouraged to continue responding directly to requests from individuals with disabilities, there may be occasions when making a decision about accommodations is complicated by other factors.  For instance, the need for an accommodation may be obvious, or it may be difficult to determine what constitutes a reasonable accommodation, or a department's budget may be unable to absorb the total cost of providing the accommodation requested.  The following procedure has been developed to ensure that employee requests for reasonable accommodations are treated in as consistent and equitable a fashion as possible.
<dt><br>
<dt>Procedure for Requesting and Receiving Reasonable Accommodations
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
			<dt>1)	The employee requesting an accommodation obtains, completes, and forwards to his or her department chair or supervisor and Application for Reasonable Accommodation(s).
<dt><br>
			<dt>2)	The department chair or supervisor completes the second half of the Application for Reasonable Accommodation, returns one copy to the individual requesting the accommodation, and forwards one copy to the Dean, who will forward the request to the Human Resources Office.  The Human Resources Office notifies the employee of the disposition of the request for accommodation(s) within two weeks of receiving the application.
<dt><br>
			<dt>3)	If the department chair or supervisor states on the Application for Reasonable Accommodation that the department can provide the requested accommodation directory without additional documentation or assistance, the application process is complete, and the department proceeds with necessary arrangement.  The Application for Reasonable Accommodation remains on file in the Human Resources Office for recordkeeping purposes only.
<dt><br>
			<dt>4)	If the department chair or supervisor states on the Application for Reasonable Accommodation that the department or unit is prevented from directly accommodating the request due solely to budgetary considerations, and if it is determined that the request or some mutually agreed upon variation thereof may be accommodated without undue financial hardship to the institution as a whole, the Human Resources Office contacts the appropriate dean or director, who then assists in locating funds through channels within his or her own division.  It is expected that required job accommodations will usually be funded directly by the employee's department or unit.
<dt><br>
			<dt>5)	If the department chair or supervisor states on the Applications for Reasonable Accommodation that the department lacks information necessary for making a decision about the request, the request is referred to the Director of Human Resources, who notifies the applicant of the need for additional information.
<dt><br>
			<dt>6)	If the procedure for requesting and receiving reasonable accommodations is not completed before step 5, the Application for Reasonable Accommodation as well as all additional information and supporting documentation is forwarded to the Human Resources Office for review by the Director of Human Resources and/or her designee.  If, based on the review, the Director of Human Resources determines that the employee is entitled to an accommodation and that the proposed accommodation is reasonable as defined by the ADA, she will consult with the employee's supervisor about appropriate methods of implementing the requested accommodation or some variation thereof.
<dt><br>
			<dt>7)	If a review of the request and of supporting documentation is inconclusive, or if it is determined that medical documentation is inadequate or otherwise problematic, the Director of Human Resources and/or her designee, after consulting with the Provost, will specify to the applicant why the documentation is unacceptable, and the applicant will be allowed to submit additional supporting documentation.  If, after this additional documentation has been submitted, the need for an accommodation is still not clearly established, the employee may be asked to submit to a medical examination by an appropriate medical professional designated and paid for by the College.  The submitted medical documentation and reports from medical exams will be used solely to assist the appropriate College officials in making an informed decision about the employee's request for accommodation.  All such documentation will be held in the strictest of confidence and kept separate from personnel records.
<dt><br>
			<dt>8)	While the College may seek technical assistance from  a medical professional, State or local rehabilitation agencies or disability constituent organizations in determining how to accommodate a particular individual in a specific situation, the decision as to what is and what is not an appropriate accommodation is made by the College.  If the individual requesting an accommodation is made by the College.  If the individual requesting an accommodation believes that a decision to deny the request was based on illegal discrimination, complaints may be filed with either the New York State Division of Human Rights or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  The College's Human Resources Office can provide addresses and telephone numbers of regional offices.  Classified employees also have access to an appeal process through the Reasonable Accommodations Unit of the New York State Department of Civil Service (518-457-8023).

	<dt>*  METAL CANS (ALUMINUM & TIN)<br>
	<dt>*  GLASS BOTTLES AND JARS (CLEAR, GREEN, & BROWN)<br>
	<dt>*  WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO SEPARATE YOUR REDEEMABLE CANS AND BOTTLES TO KEEP THEM OUT OF THE WASTE STREAM.  REMEMBER TO BRING YOUR RECYCLABLES TO THE COLLECTION AREA IN YOUR BUILDING FOR REMOVAL.
<br><BR>
</dl>
<dt><A NAME="12A44"><i>44</A>.	REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES TO CANDIDATES INVITED TO CAMPUS FOR AN INTERVIEW</i>
<dt><br>
<dt>Within available funds and within local and State of New York guidelines, candidates invited to campus for a position (classified and unclassified) interview requiring travel in excess of 100 miles (one-way) may be reimbursed in full for expenses (transportation, meals, lodging, etc.).
 <dt><br>
<dt>Exceptions to these policies, where appropriate, must have prior approval of the President of the College.
 <dt><br>
<dt>Vice Presidents and Deans are requested to exercise careful management of recruitment monies for departments and divisions under their supervision.  This should include consultation with Chair/Director and search committees as to specific recruitment costs and available resources.  Search committee chairs should meet with the Director of Human Resources at the start of every search to verify expected recruitment costs.  Chairs/Directors and heads of search committees are expected to exercise all possible economies, without damaging the effectiveness of their searches.
<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A45"><i>45</A>.	RELEASED TIME FOR FACULTY ASSEMBLY CHAIRPERSON</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The Chair of the Faculty Assembly will be eligible for up to three credit hours per semester of released time from regular instructional responsibilities in recognition of his or her duties and responsibilities for faculty governance activities.  When the chair's absence from a portion of his or her teaching responsibilities impacts the instructional program, funds may be made available to provide appropriate temporary service assistance upon recommendation of the deans.

	<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A46"><i>46</A>.	RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN OR ANIMAL SUBJECTS</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>According to Federal and State law the Research Foundation, and College policy any research proposal involving the use of human or animal subjects must receive the approval of the campus Human Subjects Institutional Review Board or the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee as appropriate prior to submission to a sponsor or implementation of the research project.  The purpose of this policy is to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects and to insure humane treatment of animal subjects.  Individuals who propose to engage in research involving the use of human subjects should contact Dr. Karl Thaller, Psychology Department. Information and quicklines will be provided by these persons.

	<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A47"><i>47</A>.	RESPONDING TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>SUNY Potsdam is committed to the free exchange of ideas between people of different social and political systems.  It is the policy of the College to encourage such interaction.  The College also believes that its employees should cooperate with and assist officials of government agencies when appropriate.  While the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), commonly known as the Buckley Amendment, forbids staff members from providing certain information, the College neither requires its employees to answer questions posed by representatives of government agencies nor forbids its staff from responding to such inquiries.  Faculty and staff can obtain information on FERPA from the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Services and can obtain assistance from his office in case of doubt about whether to respond to government officials.

	<dt><br>
		<dt><A NAME="12A48"><i>48</A>.	RESPONDING TO LEGAL AGENCIES</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The Office of Human Resources is responsible for the coordination of the responses of a legal nature on this campus.  A part of this responsibility includes overseeing of official responses to requests for information and data from off-campus legal agencies such as the Office of University Counsel, the Office of the Attorney General and Attorneys at Law.
<dt><br>
<dt>The Director of Human Resources, should be informed of all requests for information from such sources.  These requests arrive with some frequency and often ask for similar information from various campus sources.  Coordination of replies is necessary to insure that proper procedures are followed and correct information is disseminated.
<dt><br>
		<dt>In addition, the Director is designated as the official campus liaison with the Office of the State University Counsel.  University Counsel is the legal advisor to the University.  Individual employees and departments requiring legal advice and opinion pertaining to College affairs should make initial contact with the Director and should forward to the Director copies of relevant correspondence.
<dt><br>
<dt>Your cooperation is appreciated and will insure consistency in our campus procedures and responses.

		<BLOCKQUOTE>The Office of Institutional Research is responsible for the coordination of data on this campus.  A part of this responsibility includes overseeing of official responses to requests for data from off-campus individuals and agencies.  
<BR><BR>

The Office of Institutional Research should be informed of all requests for data from such sources.  These requests arrive with considerable frequency, and many ask for similar information.  Coordination of replies is necessary to insure that correct information is being disseminated.  Also, it is important for this office to know the nature, range and variety of information being sought from our College.  Therefore, copies of responses to requests that might not require official information (e.g. questionnaires that ask for personal opinion on professional problems) should also be sent to the Office of Institutional Research for its records.  Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated.  It will insure improved flow of accurate information both on and off the campus.

	<BLOCKQUOTE><I><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="12A50">50</A>.	SAFETY GUIDELINES</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

		<BLOCKQUOTE>New York State's Public Employees <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="OSHA">Occupational Safety and
Health Act</A> provides that the same safety and health standards that apply to workers in the private sector apply to employees in the public sector.  SUNY complies with these safety and health standards by furnishing its employees with a job and workplace free from recognized hazards and by providing responsible and adequate protection to the lives and safety of its staff.
<BR>
<BR>

No one in the University is required to work under conditions that are manifestly dangerous. Some less obvious but still hazardous conditions may exist, so always be sure:
<BR>
<BR>

-	That appliances which protrude from walls and doors, such as pencil sharpeners, are not positioned where people may be injured by them;
<BR>
<BR>

-That wastebaskets, electric cords, telephone, and similar objects are not located where people may trip over them;
<BR>
<BR>

-That safety procedures for laboratories are understood and followed;
<BR>
<BR>
		-	That you hold on to the handrails when using stairs;
<BR>
<BR>

		-	That you remain at a safe distance from the elevator doors;
<BR>
<BR>

		-	That the drawers of filing cabinets and desks are kept closed when not in use;
<BR>
<BR>

		-	That the upper drawers of filing cabinets are not filled to capacity while lower drawers are empty, thereby creating the possibility of the cabinets tipping over; and
<BR>
<BR>

		-	That burning cigarettes or matches are not thrown into the wastebaskets.
<BR>
<BR>

		Use common sense at all times and report any hazardous conditions to your supervisor.  You should consult with your supervisor concerning evacuation procedures and other emergency situations.

	<I><BLOCKQUOTE><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="12A51">51</A>.	SCIENTIFIC MISCONDUCT</BLOCKQUOTE></I>

		<BLOCKQUOTE>A crucial element of any policy on scientific misconduct that is to be fair and effective is a process that will distinguish instances of genuine and serious misconduct from insignificant deviations from acceptable practices, technical violations of rules, simple carelessness, and other such minor infractions.  The policy proposed in this document will allow such distinctions to be made in a manner that minimizes disruptiveness and protects the conscientious, honest scientist from false or mistaken accusations.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>a)	Policy Statement</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>


	<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>It is the purpose of these policies to instill and promote the principles of professional integrity, to prevent scientific misconduct, and to discover and censure instances of misconduct when they occur.  Accordingly,</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>


			<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>i)	SUNY Potsdam shall maintain high ethical standards in science and other scholarly work, prevent misconduct where possible, and promptly and fairly evaluate and resolve instances of alleged or apparent misconduct.
<BR>
<BR>


			ii)	Every member of the College community has the responsibility of reporting misconduct in scientific work.  No person raising serious allegations of misconduct will suffer any penalty; however, frivolous, mischievous or malicious misrepresentation in alleging misconduct will not be tolerated and may result in action against the perpetrator.
<BR>
<BR>


			iii)	SUNY Potsdam shall take appropriate disciplinary action against any individual found guilty of misconduct.  This will include disclosure to funding agencies, collaborating scientists and institutions, journal editors, professional associations, licensing boards, and potential employers who request oral or written references.
<BR>
<BR>

			iv)	These policies apply to scientific research and related scholarly writing conducted by any member of the University faculty or staff.  They are not intended to address issues, such as the conduct of students in fulfilling course requirements, which are covered by other policies.
<BR>
<BR>

			v)	These procedures for the institutional handling of allegations of scientific misconduct normally have four stages:</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>(a)an inquiry to determine whether the allegation or related issues warrant further investigation;
<BR>
<BR>
				(b)	when warranted, an investigation to collect and thoroughly examine evidence;
<BR>
<BR>
			(c)	a formal finding, and
<BR>
<BR>
				(d)	appropriate disposition of the matter.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

			<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>vi)	As a general rule, the College will take no more than 60 days to conduct its inquiry and determine whether an investigation is warranted.  If an investigation is to be undertaken, it will begin within 30 days of the conclusion of the inquiry, and the institution shall generally take no more than 120 days to complete the investigation, prepare the report of findings, obtain the comments of the subject(s) of the investigation, and make a decision on the disposition of the case.
<BR>
<BR>
			vii)	The College will annually report to all funding and sponsoring agencies as follows:</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>(a)	Assurance that the institution has established an administrative process for reviewing, investigating, and reporting allegations of misconduct in science in connection with sponsored research.
<BR>
<BR>

		<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>e)	Inquiry and Investigation of Allegations</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>


			<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>i)	Inquiry</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>


				<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>(a)	As a first step in the process of inquiry an initial report of alleged misconduct will be prepared in writing by the Misconduct Policy Officer.  The accuracy of this report must be attested to by a statement signed by the person(s) originating the report.  The Misconduct Policy Officer will then conduct an immediate, informal, discrete inquiry into allegations of misconduct in order to determine  whether there is a substantial basis for initiating a formal investigation into the alleged misconduct.  The Misconduct Policy Officer will make every effort to safeguard all individual reputations and the integrity of the research.  Every effort shall be made to protect the interests and privacy of those who in good faith report apparent misconduct and others who testify.  In the conduct of this Inquiry, the Misconduct Policy Officer may consult, on an ad hoc basis, with faculty members of his/her choice.
<BR>
<BR>

				(b)	The faculty member or other investigator whose research is the subject of the complaint shall be notified that a complaint has been lodged, the nature of the complaint, and the procedures to be followed.  The affected individual(s) will be granted confidential treatment to the maximum extent possible, a prompt and thorough investigation, and an opportunity to comment on allegations and findings of the inquiry and/or the investigation.
<BR>
<BR>

				(c)	Any evidence pertinent to the resolution of the issue shall be made secure by the Misconduct Policy Officer conducting the inquiry.
<BR>
<BR>

				(d)The inquiry shall be conducted in confidence with the purpose of separating unfounded allegation(s) from those of a substantive nature and shall be completed whenever possible within 60 days of the initial receipt of the allegations.  At the completion of the inquiry, a written report shall be filed with the Provost with an assessment as to whether or not the allegation(s) is warranted, and the reasons attendant thereto.  The Misconduct Policy Officer will maintain sufficiently detailed documentation of inquiries to permit a later assessment of the reasons for determining that an investigation was not warranted, if necessary.  Such records shall be maintained in a secure manner for a period of at least three years after the termination of the inquiry and shall, upon request, be provided to authorized representatives of sponsoring and funding agencies.
<BR>
<BR>

				(e)	Precautions should be taken against real or apparent conflicts of interest on the part of those involved in the inquiry or investigation.
<BR>
<BR>

				(f)	The Provost shall determine on the basis of the written report of the inquiry, and any other consultation deemed necessary, whether the allegations warrant a formal investigation.  In 					either case, the basis for the decision will be fully documented.
<BR>
<BR>

				(g)	If the decision of the Provost is that no investigation is warranted, the Provost will notify all those concerned of this determination.  The Provost may also examine the propriety of the initial charge and take further action if appropriate.
<BR>
<BR>

				(h)	If the decision of the Provost is that an investigation is necessary, it shall be formally undertaken within 30 days of the completion of the inquiry.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

			<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>ii)	Submit a copy of the report to the accused for rebuttal.
<BR>
<BR>

			iii)	Include any written rebuttal by the accused as an addendum to the report.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


		<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>h)	If an investigation has been launched on the basis of a complaint, and no fraud or misconduct is found, no disciplinary measures should be taken against the complainant and the institution should undertake diligent efforts, as appropriate, to restore the reputation of persons alleged to have engaged in misconduct.  It will also undertake diligent efforts to protect the positions and reputations of those persons who, in good faith, make allegations.  If the allegations are found to have been maliciously motivated, disciplinary actions may be taken against those responsible.
<BR>
<BR>

Responsibility for recommending the nature and severity of disciplinary action will rest in the Provost.  If misconduct is confirmed, the Provost shall make recommendations to the President for appropriate sanctions against the subject.
<BR>
<BR>

The President, upon receiving the report of the Provost and any statement of rebuttal by the accused, will make a final determination regarding what action shall be taken and formally notify all parties, including the awarding agency and Research Foundation of that decision.
<BR>
<BR>

If misconduct is confirmed, the institution will take appropriate action in accordance with Article 19 of the Agreement between the State of New York and United University Professions.  A faculty/staff member who is the subject of an inquiry or investigation has, as a matter of course, the right to consultation with legal counsel if he or she chooses.  However, the faculty  member has the right to representation by counsel in institutional proceedings only after formal disciplinary charges have been filed in accordance with Section 19.8 of the Agreement between the State of New York and the United University Professions.
<BR>
<BR>

Consideration will also be given to formal notification of other concerned parties, not previously notified, such as:
<BR>
<BR>

	_	Sponsoring agencies, funding sources.<BR>

_	Co-authors, co-investigators, collaborators.<BR>

_	Editors of journals in which fraudulent research was                     published.<BR>

				_	State professional licensing boards.<BR>

				_	Editors of journals or other publications, other      institutions, sponsoring agencies, and funding sources with which the individual has been affiliated.<BR>

				_	Professional societies.<BR>

				_	Where appropriate, criminal authorities.
<BR>
<BR>

<strong>XII.  CAMPUS POLICIES</strong><BR>

</center>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<A NAME="12A"><b>A</a>.	CAMPUS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</b>
<BR>
<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><dt><A NAME="12A53">53</A>.	<i>TEACHING LOADS</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>It is the responsibility of the Deans in consultation with the Provost and department chairs to develop instructional programs which will result in reasonably equal service to students, the College and the State University of New York from each member of the teaching faculty.  The policy of SUNY Potsdam on faculty utilization reflects the criteria of the Board of Trustees of the State University of New York for the evaluation of academic employees (Policies of the Board of Trustees, Article XII, Title A) and the practice which has been in effect for many years at the College.
<dt><br>
		<dt>While the primary responsibility of full-time faculty at SUNY Potsdam is academic instruction, other responsibilities include, but are not limited to, academic advising, research and/or creative activities, continuing professional development, and campus and community service.
<dt><br>
Full-time faculty at SUNY Potsdam normally carry 12 semester hours each semester.  These 12 semester hours are not limited to standard classroom teaching, but may include contact with students in credit-bearing lab sections, research seminars, and other learning modes.  Responsibilities are not determined on the basis of student load (i.e., a professor who teaches one or more large sections is not automatically given a course load reduction).  Low-enrolled courses (e.g., fewer than 12 students in a lower division course; fewer than 9 students in an upper division course) are reviewed by the dean for possible cancellation and substitution of a higher demand course.  Some faculty also teach tutorials and direct research projects for a few students.  Schedules are reviewed before and after pre-registration to assure the effective use of faculty resources while allowing the continuation of courses that are essential to major or other programs.
<dt><br>
<dt>Currently, variations on the normal expectations of teaching load are determined by the Deans, Provost, and in some cases, by the President.  Faculty may apply for a course reduction for research and other scholarly activity through the Department and the Department Chair to the Dean's office.  Such applications state the purpose of the reduction and carry with them the recommendation of the Department and the Department Chair.  Decisions on requested reductions are made by the Provost in consultation with the appropriate dean.
<dt><br>
<dt>In addition to the reduction granted for department chairs, a reduction in teaching assignment may be granted for such reasons as:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
			<dt>--	Administrative assignments (e.g., chair of the Faculty Assembly)<br>
			<dt>--	Research and other scholarly activity, as noted above,<br>
			<dt>--	Chair of a major search committee;<br>			<dt>--	Extraordinary community service.<br>
</dl><!-- 2 --><BR>

		<dt>All full-time faculty are expected to submit an annual report of their activities.  The reports are reviewed by the deans and, in the case of decisions regarding merit pay, reappointment, promotion and the granting of continuing appointment, by the Provost and the President.  Faculty are evaluated, promoted, and receive merit pay increments on the basis of teaching effectiveness, mastery of subject matter, scholarly ability, effectiveness of university service (including advisement of students), public service, and continuing growth.   
<dt><br>
		<dt>The assessment of faculty utilization is an on-going process.  As stated in the Faculty Handbook "It is the responsibility of the Deans in consultation with the Provost and Department Affairs and Department Chairs to develop instructional programs which will result in reasonably equal service to students, the College, and the State of New York from each member of the teaching faculty."  Specifically, the Provost conducts an annual review of faculty utilization for each academic department, including an analysis of enrollments, number of majors, general education needs, student/ faculty ratios, and SUNY benchmark information.  When vacant lines are available, they are reallocated to different departments in such a way as to maximize the efficiency, effectiveness, and the quality of the overall academic program.
<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A54">54</A>.<i>	THEFT OF STATE PROPERTY</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Whenever state property is found missing or to have been stolen, the Office of Public Safety is to be notified immediately.  Public Safety personnel will initiate an immediate investigation and prepare and file required investigative reports.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<dt>
	<BLOCKQUOTE><dt><A NAME="12A55">55</A>.<i>	TRAVEL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Expenses for travel on College business by State vehicle, personal car or other transportation are subject to reimbursement as outlined in <A HREF="../Appendices/APPEN14.html">Appendix XIV</A>.

		<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
	<dt><A NAME="12A55a">a</A>)	State Vehicles
<dt><br>
			<dt>The College operates a fleet of State-owned vehicles which may be used by the faculty and staff for travel on official College business.
<dt><br>
<dt>To reserve a state-owned vehicle, you must complete a Vehicle Request/Authorization Form and send it to the Office of Physical Plant, Room 518 Raymond Hall.  Keys and a vehicle use envelope may be signed out one working day in advance of travel.  Keys and credit card receipts must be returned in the completed, signed envelope, immediately upon completion of travel.
<dt><br>
<dt>If a traveler is unable to return a state-owned vehicle on schedule, he/she is required to notify the Office of Physical Plant (267-2134).
<dt><br>
<dt>A mileage charge will be made against the traveler's authorized budget for the use of a State-owned vehicle.
<dt><br>
<dt>When available, State-owned vehicles should be used rather than privately-owned vehicles.
<dt><br>
<dt>State-owned vehicles will be operated in accordance with the guidelines prepared by the Office of General Services entitled, "Driving a State Passenger Car," a copy of which is to be located in the glove compartment of each State-owned passenger vehicle.  Fuel for these vehicles should be obtained from State facilities where possible.
<dt><br>
<dt>All designated drivers of State-owned vehicles must have valid driver's licenses and must be presented when keys are issued.
<dt><br>
<dt>Students will be assigned to drive a State-owned vehicle only when it is not feasible to use another driver.  The President (or designee) must authorize all student drivers of a State-owned vehicle.  A separate authorization for the use of a student driver must be made for each trip.  Student-owned vehicles may not be used for official College business.
State-owned vehicles may be assigned to students for the purpose of conducting official business of the Student Assembly.
<dt><br>
<dt>State-owned vehicles may be used for transporting students only for the purpose of field trips required for an instructional or research program or to inter- collegiate competitions in such fields as athletics, speech, music and drama, and other social, recreational, cultural and educational programs authorized by the President (or designee), provided such events are accompanied by a member of the campus staff.
<dt><br>
	<dt>A complete list of all students traveling in a State-owned vehicle must be filed with the Office of Physical prior to each trip.

		<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A55b">b</A>)	Personal Car
<dt><br>
			<Dt>A traveler on College business using his/her personal car will be reimbursed at the State reimbursement rate in effect at the time of travel as well as for receipted tolls and receipted parking.  The reimbursement rate may not exceed that approved by the State Comptroller.  Owners of private automobiles used for travel on College business in which students are passengers are advised to carry liability insurance of $100,000/$300,000 as a minimum.

		<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A55c">c</A>)	Out-Of-State Travel
<dt><br>
			<dt>Official travel outside of the State of New York requires prior approval of the Campus President (or designee).  Direct travel through New Jersey enroute between upstate and downstate is not considered out-of-state travel.

		<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A55d">d</A>)	Lodging Requests
<dt><br>
			<Dt>Lodging requests are available from the Accounting Office and are used when it is appropriate to charge the cost of room rental to the State of New York and the motel/hotel accepts such lodging requests.
<dt><br>
<Dt>All lodging requests issued but not used must be returned to the Accounting Office for proper accountability.

		<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A55e">e</A>)	Tax Exemption Certificates
<dt><br>
			<dt>Tax exemption certificates are available from the Accounting Office if you pay lodging charges while on College business where there is a room occupancy tax (within NYS).

		<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A55f">f</A>)	Travel Expense Voucher
<dt><br>
			<dt>In order to be reimbursed for travel expenses related to college business, a travel expense voucher must be completed by 	the traveler and received in the Accounting Office after completion of travel.  If the traveler used his/her personal car the form AC160, Statement of Automobile Travel must also be completed and submitted.

	<dt><A NAME="12A56">56</A>.	<i>TRAVEL ADVANCES</i>
<dt><br>
	<dt>Travel advances are available to individuals on College business and are issued upon request by the Accounting Office.  Travel advances are personal loans to the individual and repayment becomes the individual's responsibility.  All procedures established pursuant to travel advances are those of the New York State Department of Audit and Control and are outlined as follows:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt>a)	Lodging requests for overnight room stay should be used whenever possible.  Transportation requests should also be used for tickets whenever possible.
<dt><br>
		<dt>b)	Travel advances will be limited to those people on State payroll or specific designees of the President.
<dt><br>
		<dt>c)	Dollar amount of the travel advance will be limited to the appropriate per diem rate times the number of nights the traveler is in approved travel status up to a maximum advance of $400.00.  Plane tickets and registration fees may also be paid in advance, but these checks will only be made out to the vendor or sponsoring agent.  Tickets  and fees will not affect the $400.00 maximum advance.  Requests for advances of registration fees must be accompanied by a registration or application form.  These checks will be made out to the sponsoring agent and sent with the traveler or sent directly.
<dt><br>
		<dt>d)	All travelers wishing to receive a travel advance must fill out an Application for Travel Advance form.
<dt><br>
		<Dt>e)	As noted on the application form, it is the responsibility of the traveler to file a New York State Travel Voucher within 15 days of his/her return or a judgment affecting the traveler's next scheduled paycheck will be entered against him/her.  Revenues must continue to flow back into this system for the advance program to continue to be effective.
<dt><br>
		<dt>f)	The advance will normally be paid back by using the State of New York travel reimbursement check.  If additional funds are due the traveler, a reimbursement check will come in his/her name.  If the travel voucher falls short of the advance, the traveler will be expected to refund the balance to the account.
<dt><br>
		<dt>g)	State procedures prohibit advancing money for State vehicle or personal vehicle mileage.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Please understand that preparation of these travel advance checks takes time.  A minimum of two days should be expected for preparation of travel advance checks.  Try to plan ahead.

</dl><!-- 2 -->
	<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A59">59</A>.<i>	USE OF STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK STATIONERY</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>It is contrary to the policy of the State University of New York and the State of New York for State employees to use State agency stationery for the conduct of personal, non-agency related business.  An Executive Chamber Policy Memorandum underscores the importance of communicating this policy to employees:
<dt><br>
	<dt>"The use of State agency stationery, accompanied by the typed words `Personal and Unofficial,' constitutes an unacceptable contradiction in the message transmitted.
<dt><br>
<dt>As a matter of policy, State agency stationery should be utilized only for official governmental business.  If a communication is `personal and unofficial,' it has no business being sent on agency stationery.  Sending such communications on agency stationery could give the appearance of an inappropriate attempt to utilize the influence of an individual's office for a private purpose."
<dt><br>
		<dt>All State University employees should make every effort to keep official and personal activities separate and to avoid potential conflicts of interest.

	<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A60">60</A>.<i>	USE OF UNIVERSITY RESEARCH EQUIPMENT</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The following guidelines underscore the University's willingness to have industry use the University's research equipment through cooperative arrangements involving faculty, students, and technical staff:
<dt><br>
	<dt>SUNY Potsdam is committed to implementing arrangements for cooperative use of available research equipment, while recognizing that priority  on use of such equipment must be for the University's primary academic mission and activities of the campus.
<dt><br>
<dt>In recognition of this educational mission, proposals for cooperative use of equipment should involve faculty, students or technical staff in ways that add to their knowledge and professional skills.
<dt><br>
<Dt>Each such cooperative use of research equipment must be defined in scope (by dollar amount, time, or other quantitative measure).  Appropriate permit or contract procedures should be followed consistent with the procedures developed for the administration of sponsored programs and the use of University facilities by outside organizations.
<dt><br>
<dt>In order to ensure that necessary priority is given to ongoing University research and educational programs the determination  regarding the availability of particular items of equipment for cooperative use should rest with the Provost, or designee, in consultation with the principal research investigators.
<dt><br>
<dt>University facility and equipment services will not be provided to non-University organizations or individuals in direct competition with private companies that provide equivalent equipment services on a commercial basis in the geographic region.
<dt><br>
<dt>Under normal circumstances, full cost, both direct and indirect must be recovered, including special costs relating directly to security, insurance and indemnification protection for the University.
<dt><br>
<dt>All arrangements must be consistent with Board of Trustees' policies.  Non-University organizations and individuals, who utilize University research facilities under such cooperative arrangements, will retain ownership of all patentable inventions or discoveries.
<dt><br>
<dt>Consistent with Trustees' Policies, patent and licensing rights may also be subject to provisions of formal agreements with industrial sponsors of University research programs.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Responsibility for the management of these Guidelines lies with the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs, to which all inquiries should be directed.

	<dt><br>
<A NAME="12A61">61.  </A>WHEELED VEHICLES<BR>
<BR>
SUNY Potsdam recognizes that skateboards, roller blades, bicycles and other wheeled vehicles or devices are legitimate of both exercise and transportation.  However, some people chose to utilize these items in other than a conventional manner, thereby creating a physical danger to themselves and others as well as a hazard to property.  In an effort to continue to provide for the open use of college property of these modes of transportation, the following guidelines are adopted.<BR>
<BR>
1.  Trick or stunt riding is prohibited.  Trick or stunt riding is defined as repetitive or competitive moves where wheels leave the surface.  Vehicles or devices used in such a manner are subject to impounding.<BR>
2.  No wheeled vehicle or device for personal transportation may be used in any campus building.   Wheel chairs and youth stollers are exempt from this provision.<BR>
3.  Skateboards, bicylcles, roller blades and similar wheeled devices are prohibited from any tennis court surface.<BR>
4.  Skateboards and roller blades using sidewalks will do so safely and will yield the right of way to predestrians.<BR>
5.  Skateboards and roller blades using campus roadways will travel in the right lane of traffic only, as close to the right hand curb as is feasible and safe.<BR>
<BR>

	<dt><A NAME="12A62">62</A>.<i>	WORK WEEK FOR EMPLOYEES IN THE CLASSIFIED SERVICE</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The basic work week for full-time classified employees in maintenance and public safety positions is 40 hours a week.  For other classified employees (non-shift) such as those in secretarial and clerical positions, it is 37 1/2 hours a week.  Except in certain situations, the work week consists of five consecutive days working and 2 consecutive days off.  For time accruals and payroll purposes, the work week begins on  Thursday and ends on Wednesday.

	<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A63">63</A>.<i>	WORK DAY FOR EMPLOYEES IN THE CLASSIFIED SERVICE</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The normal work day is 8 hours, plus meal time, for classified employees working 40 hours a week.  Since the College is in operation seven days a week, schedules and hours for individuals may vary.  In general, the maintenance and public safety areas shift schedules are as follows:  7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. or 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., 3:30 p.m. to 12 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. including a half hour meal time.
<dt><br>
		<dt>The normal work day for classified employees working a 37 1/2 hour week is 7 1/2 hours, plus meal time.  The normal schedule for such employees (non-shift) is 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. or 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. with one hour for lunch.  The option of a half hour lunch is permissible with appropriate adjustment in the work day schedule.
<dt><br>
<dt>Two fifteen minute rest (coffee) breaks are permissible although not mandated with the provision that if such breaks are not used this time may not be used to shorten the work day.  Exceptions from the normal schedule may be granted on an occasional basis for such circumstances as personal illness, transportation difficulties, and family obligations.  Such exceptions must be approved in advance by the employee's supervisor.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<strong>XII.  CAMPUS POLICIES</strong><BR>

<dd><dl>
<A NAME="12A"><b>A</a>.	CAMPUS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</b>

<dt><br>
	<BLOCKQUOTE><dt><A NAME="12A64">64</A>.<i>	WORK ORDER REQUESTS</i>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
	<dt><A NAME="12A64a">a</A>)	Maintenance of Campus Physical Facilities
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	Scope
<dt><br>
				<dt>Maintenance of campus physical facilities is the responsibility of the Physical Plant Department.  Work done by the department may be classified as either routine or non-routine.
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 4 -->
<dt>(a)	Routine Work
<dt><br>
	<dt>The primary function of the Physical Plant Department is the routine maintenance and operation of campus physical facilities.  This function is defined as upkeep, repair, replacement and preventative maintenance of buildings, systems, components and non-academic equipment as originally configured, installed and operated.  Routine maintenance and operation work is given priority.  This is necessary because facility malfunctions tend to affect the campus community as a whole, rather than one or a few individuals.  The cost of routine maintenance is the responsibility of the Physical Plant Department and is paid from the department's operating budget.
<dt><br>
<dt>(b)	Non-Routine Work
<dt><br>
<dt>Non-routine work is considered any job that is not maintenance and operation oriented, such as requests for partitions, shelves, space alterations, utility enlargements, academic equipment construction and/or repair.  The cost of non-routine work is not a part of the Physical Plant Department's operating budget.  The funding source will have to be identified and the project may require approval of the Building Administrator, Department Chairperson/Director, Dean, Provost and/or President.
</dl><!-- 4 -->
<dt><br>
			<dt>ii)	Procedures
<dt><br>
				<dt>A request to have work (routine or non-routine) performed is processed using a Work Request form.  This form is available from the Office of Physical Plant.
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 4 -->
<dt>(a)	Three copies of the completed work request form (including Department Chairperson/Director and Building Administrator approval) is submitted to the Physical Plant Office.  One copy (pink) is retained for department files.
<dt><br>
<dt>(b)	Physical Plant personnel will review the work request to determine the feasibility of the request, as well as the capability of the Physical Plant Department to complete the project, and budget and personnel requirements.
<dt><br>
				<dt>(c)	For non-routine work, the Physical Plant Office will estimate the project cost, recommend a funding source(s) (e.g. department budget, campus OTPS pool, capital construction), and discuss with the requester before proceeding.  Where the funding source identified is the campus OTPS pool, it is the requester's responsibility to request the funds.  If capital construction funds are required, the Assistant Vice President for Facilities is responsible for submitting the request as required after approval by the President (or designee).
<dt><br>
<dt>(d)Authorized work requests will be assigned to the appropriate supervisor for action.  The requester will be notified that this has been done.  Unauthorized requests are returned to the requester with explanation.
<dt><br>
<dt>(e)A monthly status review of Work Requests will be completed by the Physical Plant Office.  Incomplete work orders will be discussed with appropriate supervisor and analyzed for resolution.
<dt><br>
				<dt>(f)	The requester may, at any time, ask for a status report pertaining to his/her work order by contacting the Physical Plant Office personnel.
<dt><br>
				<dt>It is to be noted that because of the large number of work orders submitted it may not always be possible to complete requests within time limits desired due to available personnel, funding requirements, the availability of materials and other commitments.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<BLOCKQUOTE><dt><A NAME="12A64b">b</A>)	SUNY Potsdam Telecommunications Network
<dt><br>
			<dt>The SUNY Potsdam Telecommunications Network supports voice, video and data services.  Voice services are provided through a cable plant of twisted-pair wiring connecting each campus telephone set (digital and analog) to a campus AT&T switch.  Voice services include AUDIX voice mail and auto-attendant features.    
<dt><br>
<dt>Video (TV) services are provided via coaxial cable from a campus-managed SMATV distribution system.  Programming consists of 22 channels of television and a campus information channel and is delivered to every student room and many classrooms.   
<dt><br>
<dt>Data services are provided by standard Ethernet networking via fiber and thinwire cable to nearly every office, classroom, computer center and laboratory on campus.  Data communication protocols currently supported include AppleTalk, DECnet, LAT, Novell IPX, TCP/IP.  Remote access to the data network supporting ARA, SLIP, PPP and standard RS232 is provided via a bank of 1200/2400/9600/14000 modems.
<dt><br>
<dt>Services relating to the SUNY Potsdam Telecommunications Network (repair, maintenance or installation) must be requested from the Distributed Computing/TeleMedia department on a Network Add/Change/Repair form.  Forms are available from the telephone office of Distributed Computing/TeleMedia in Kellas Hall (x3000).  The form must not only include a description of the work to be performed, but also an account for billing if parts and materials must be purchased.  If assistance from the Physical Plant is needed, that office will be notified using the standard Physical Plant work-request form.  Usually, requests will be handled on a first-come, first-served basis.  Exceptions will be made for emergency requests if they are within reason.

		<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="12A64c">c</A>)	Audio-Visual/Electronic Repairs
<dt><br>
			<dt>All repairs of departmentally-managed audio-visual or elec- tronic equipment are to be requested by memorandum to the Director of Distributed Computing/TeleMedia.  If the repairs require an extraordinary expensive part or component, the department may be asked to find funding to share in the cost.  When necessary, and if available, temporary replacement will be supplied.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="13A">A</A>.	<b>EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICY OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK (SUNY)</b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>The State University of New York Board of Trustees adopted an Equal Opportunity policy in 1971 calling for the development of a University-wide Affirmative Action Program to "detail actions designed to realize our University's commitment to equal employment; analyze employment patterns within the University; set forth plans to rectify any deficiencies; identify and remove impediments to equal opportunity;...provide for internal and external dissemination of University policy; pursue the commitment to equal opportunity throughout the institution; and provide for the review, assessment, evaluation, and improvement of University action in carrying out...Affirmative Action Programs.  The SUNY Office for Affirmative Action, a part of the Chancellor's Office has responsibility for implementation of this policy.  In addition to the matters listed above, the Office also has responsibility for administering the SUNY Discrimination Grievance Procedure, programs for the handicapped, and programs to encourage minority business development.
    <dt><br> 
	<dt>Today, every SUNY campus has a designated Affirmative Action Officer, and Affirmative Action Committee, which is advisory to the campus President, and a written Affirmative Action Plan and Program.  There is also a system-wide SUNY Task Force on Affirmative Action, which is advisory to the Chancellor.
<dt><br>
	<dt>Employees of the State University of New York are assured equal opportunity without regard to race, sex, age, national origin, religion, marital status, pregnancy, disability, ex-offender status, or sexual orientation.  In addition Vietnam Era Veterans and disabled veterans are ensured equal opportunity under the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Act of 1974.
<dt><br>
	<dt>Any employee of the State University of New York who believes that he or she has been discriminated against in any personnel decision or condition of employment may file a complaint with his or her campus Affirmative Action Officer using the University's Internal Discrimination Grievance Procedures.  A copy of the procedures is available from the campus Office for Affirmative Action.  Externally, complaints may be filed with the local office of the Equal Employment for Human Rights.  Complaints of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation may be filed with the Governor's Office for Employee Relations in Albany.  The campus Affirmative Action Officer will provide addresses, phone numbers, and filing procedures to any employee requesting such information.

<A NAME="13B">B</A>.	<b>EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICY OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK, AT POTSDAM</b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>SUNY POTSDAM is committed to the principles of non- discrimination and equality of opportunity in all of its personnel procedures and practices.  The College recruits, selects, hires,  trains and promotes staff and provides benefits without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age or handicap except where sex, age or handicap are bona fide occupational qualifications.
<dt><br>
	<dt>It is the policy of the SUNY Potsdam to provide equal opportunity in employment and upward mobility for all qualified persons, to prohibit discrimination in employment because of age, color, handicap, marital status, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual preference, and Vietnam Era Veteran status.
<dt><br>
	<dt>This policy of equal employment opportunity:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
	<dt>1.	Applies to all persons without regard to race, creed, color, national origin, age or sex, except where sex is a bona fide occupational qualification.
<dt><br>
	<dt>2.	Applies equally to all job classifications and titles at SUNY Potsdam and to all types of appointment, whether full-time or part-time.
<dt><br>
	<dt>3.	Governs all college employment policies, practices and actions including but not necessarily limited to recruitment, employment, rate of pay or other compensation, advancement, upgrading, promotion, demotion, renewal, non-renewal, termination, transfer, layoff, leave, training and employee benefits of whatever nature.
<dt><br>
	<dt>4.	Applies to all college employees wherever physically located.
<dt><br>
	<dt>5.	Expects each contractor, supplier, union, public agency or other cooperative agent to support this policy by complying with all applicable State and Federal equal employment opportunity laws and regulations.
<dt><br>
	<dt>In addition to providing equal employment opportunities for all qualified persons, the College has a special commitment to the principle of Affirmative Action, which entails a positive, ongoing effort to seek qualified members of two under-represented groups:  women and minorities.  It is the goal of this College to achieve equitable representation of women and minorities in all academic, administrative, and service units of the College.

<dt><br>
<A NAME="13C">C</A>.	<b>COMMITMENT TO QUALITY</b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>The standing of SUNY Potsdam as a leading liberal arts college in the State of New York and in the nation requires that it recruit staff of the highest possible caliber.  Its faculty and staff should be highly qualified for their positions and they should show promise of achievement in the future.  They should exhibit breadth as well as depth of talent and they should be drawn from a diversity of backgrounds.
<dt><br>
	<dt>The search for new talent should, under normal circumstances, be national in scope.  It should include advertising in leading professional journals, contact with major centers of excellence and a systematic attempt to bring to the campus the most talented and promising candidates.  The College should avoid settling for less than the best.

<dt><br>
<A NAME="13D">D</A>.	<b>RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES</b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>From the Office of the President of the College:
<dt><br>
	<dt>"The search for candidates to fill faculty and staff positions is perhaps the most important activity in which we as a College engage.  Through such searches, we announce not only our philosophy of hiring but also, in effect, the quality and nature of our institution.  On a more subtle level, we also signal the kind of curricula we offer - and whether or not we are current in this area.  Most importantly, searches constitute the principal means for creating the SUNY Potsdam of tomorrow, since the faculty and staff members hired as a result of the search process today will be the core of the institution in years to come.  We must settle for nothing less than the very best in candidates and must act assertively to locate and attract them to our campus, even if doing so requires more than traditional methods of advertising positions and examining applications.
<dt><br>
	<dt>The search process, while primarily the means for acquiring new and needed colleagues, also comes to represent the College in the forum of public and social concern.  For this reason, the search procedure carries with it great social responsibility.  Over the past several decades, we as a people have recognized the need to represent more accurately in the workplace the diversity of cultures and the differences based on gender that are expressed in our society at large.  In response to this imperative, policies have evolved to rectify the imbalances that resulted, seemingly automatically though often perhaps unconsciously, in previous hiring practices in all sectors.  As a public institution, we particularly embrace these policies as our own.
<dt><br>
	<dt>In so doing, we subscribe to the egalitarian principles that lie at the heart of our society.  We must guarantee to all members of society equal access to real opportunities for development and growth.  But our dedication to such a philosophy benefits those of us who offer such opportunities, as well as those to whom they are offered.  It is by now a truism that faculty members who are women or members of minorities provide role models to those of our students who share either their gender or their ethnic origins.  Less acknowledged but equally important is the kind of model these members represent to traditional, non-minority students as well, who can learn new and different approaches to academic subjects than those traditional faculty members might be able to offer.  The presence of women and minority faculty members also provides all of our students with a real sense of the multicultural society they are about to enter as adults, and the options in thought and manner that a pluralistic society encourages, and on which it depends.
<dt><br>
	<dt>Likewise, the entire faculty gains from the variety in perspective and opinion that often follows from differences in gender, race, or ethnicity among its members.  The scholarly activity stimulated by these differences also fosters growth in the general body of academic knowledge, often charting new areas of scholarship and research, and teaching us new ways to know.  Thus the pursuit of affirmative action  policies benefits us all." 
<dt><br>
	<dt>A summary of the College's recruitment procedures follows.  Complete details are found in the manual - SEARCH COMMITTEE PROCEDURES available from the Offices of Human Resources or Affirmative Action.

	<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
<dt><A NAME="13D1">1.</A>	<i>INITIATING THE SEARCH</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>In identifying vacant positions that will be advertised as tenure-track, the dean/director will meet with department chairs to prioritize and define the proposed positions.  Positions that have been filled after having been advertised as temporary must be readvertised if the positions are converted to permanent or tenure-track.  It should not be assumed that all vacancies from retirements, resignations, terminations will be filled and that positions that have previously been "temporary" will be converted to tenure-track.

		<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
<dt><A NAME="13D1a">a</A>)	Recruitment Request
<dt><br>
			<dt>To formally initiate the search, approval must be obtained by securing the signature and approval of the Dean and others indicated on the recruitment request form.  All Recruitment Requests will be reviewed by Priorities Council to determine whether the search can go forward.  Upon receipt of the signed form, Human Resources is authorized to begin the search.

		<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13D1b">b</A>)	Advertising
<dt><br>
			<dt>Departments will prepare the ad as they recommend it be sent.  Rank, title, salary range, job description and application procedures will be determined by the Provost.  This information is to be forwarded to Human Resources via e-mail with a hard copy of the ad or placed in a shared folder/drop box.  General information pertaining to SUNY Potsdam will be prepared by Human Resources.  Advertising should be broad and open to attract the largest number of applicants.  The position describes the essential qualifications and duties.  The final ad copy will be prepared as a result of consultation with the department, Dean, Provost, and Vice President.  Before going to print, each advertisement must be reviewed and approved by the department chair (or dean after conversation with the department chair).

			<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
<dt><A NAME="13D1bi">i</A>)	Faculty Searches
<dt><br>
				<dt>In order to advertise a position as tenure-track, the ad must normally be placed by November 1.  Human Resources will place one master ad in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Black Issues in Higher Education, and the Hispanic Outlook early in the fall semester after consultation and approval by the Provost.  To the extent possible, all anticipated openings should be listed in this combined job announcement.

			<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13D1bii">ii</A>)	Professional and Management Searches
<dt><br>
				<dt>The campus has established a policy in which these positions are advertised either internally first or simultaneously internally/externally.  This process will allow internal candidates to be considered prior to extending the position to external candidates.  
<dt><br>
			<dt>In addition, departments should for all positions:<br>
			<dt>--	identify and provide the advertising copy for other publications, such as disciplinary publications, specialized journals, publications geared to women or minorities, etc.  As with the Chronicle ad, these ads must also be reviewed, and approved by the Deans.<br>
			<dt>--	Contact historically black institutions and ask for recommendations<br>
			<dt>--	Contact professional organizations to determine if there are minority or women's caucuses, committees, or employment registers<br>
			<dt>--	Make personal contacts with colleagues who might be interested in a move or might nominate others<br>
			<dt>--	Make telephone calls to colleagues and schools to seek out underrepresented applicants<br>
			<dt>--	Use source lists of minority candidates available through the dean's offices<br>
			<Dt>--	Utilize employment services at conventions
</dl><!-- 3 -->
		<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13D1c">c</A>)	Composition of the Search Committee
<dt><br>
			<dt>The chair of the search committee may or may not be the department chair or director.  In the case of a search for a department chair, at least one member of the search committee shall come from outside the affected department.  The committee should have a minimum of three members, and may be as large as deemed appropriate.  In the spirit of a student-centered campus, serious consideration should be given to having one or more students serve as committee members.  Even if students do not serve on the search committee, student involvement should be sought in the search process.
<dt><br>
			<dt>The search committee should reflect the interests and characteristics of various constituencies, taking into consideration ethnicity, gender, age, different areas of specialization within the department.  Search committees should be balanced.  If there is not sufficient diversity within a hiring department, serious consideration should be given to including a member from outside the department.  In general, if search committees themselves are diverse, we may be more successful in attracting multicultural candidates.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Other considerations:<br>
			<dt>--	Are the interests of non-tenured faculty and staff included?<br>
			<dt>--	Is someone with prior search committee experience on the committee?<br>
			<dt>--	Are the search committee nominees aware of the time commitment their participation will involve?<br>
			<dt>--	Should any members from outside the department be involved in the search?  (This may be appropriate in the absence of women and/or minorities in the department).<br>
			<dt>--	Is there anyone with access to special networks of talent that the search committee might tap for nominees?<br>
<dt><br>
			<dt>The final composition of a faculty search committee and selection of the chair will be determined in consultation with the appropriate dean/director who may add committee members from outside the hiring department.
<dt><br>
			<dt>If the position to be searched for is Vice President or President, the Faculty Assembly By-Laws require a process different from the one identified above.

		<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13D1d">d</A>)	Search Committee Charge
<dt><br>
			<dt>The dean/director/provost/vice president/president should specify the role of the committee.  It may be to identify and recommend for appointment qualified applicants not to make job offers or engage in discussions with candidates on term and conditions of employment.
</dl><!-- 2 -->
	<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13D2">2</A>.	<i>FOLLOW-UP ON APPLICATIONS</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>A letter of acknowledgement and affirmative action card should be sent immediately upon receipt of an application.  Applicants should be informed as to the timetable of decision-making.  As vitae are received, they are to be available for review by the dean/director and appropriate vice president/provost.  Vitae of women and applicants from protected classes may be requested for special review.
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt>a)	Develop Written Criteria for Screening
<dt><br>
			<dt>Prior to the receipt of applications, the committee should decide upon the criteria to be used for preliminary and final screening stages.  The preliminary screening should be limited to information contained in the advertisement.  For example, if the ad specified a Ph.D., all applicants without a doctorate should be rejected.  If no minimum amount of experience was stated in the ad, candidates should not be eliminated on the basis of a lack of experience at this early stage.
<dt><br>
			<dt>The search committee identifies those applicants who do not meet the qualifications for the position and so informs them.  Remaining applicants may be asked to send additional material by a specific date.
<dt><br>
		<dt>b)	The following MUST take place PRIOR to inviting candidates to campus:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	It is a good idea to send candidates information about SUNY Potsdam.  This could include the catalog, recent class schedule, the brochure SUNY Potsdam: A Profile, and any departmental documents that would help the candidate understand the nature of the vacant position and the college.  Information on the town of Potsdam may also be sent to the candidate and is available in Human Resources.
<dt><br>
			<dt>ii)	Telephone referencing:  The search committee should discuss in advance the questions to be asked.  These questions should be in writing to ensure that consistent questions are asked about each candidate.  Contact only persons who have been listed as references by the candidate.  With the candidate's permission you can contact references other than those listed by the candidate.  Arrangements may be made for a conference call through the Office of Human Resources.  Conference calls also can be set up via tele-media box.  Long-distance calls will be charged to the Office of Human Resources.
<dt><br>
			<dt>iii)	Telephone interview of finalists:  Before a campus interview is scheduled, a telephone interview of finalists may be conducted.  A written interview protocol should be prepared by the committee for use during the interviews and retained in the committee's files as part of the search record.  Each candidate should be asked the same questions for purposes of comparison and fairness.  Information is also provided  on resources available in Human Resources to improve the interviewing skills of committee members.
<dt><br>
			<dt>iv)	Consultation with the Dean/Director:  The Dean/Director should be informed as to the characteristics of the applicant pool and of the qualifications of the finalists who may be invited to campus.  The Dean/Director/Vice President/Provost/President may choose to examine the pool of candidates.  The number of candidates to invite for campus interviews will be decided in consultation with the Dean/Director (but normally will be limited to two).  The Dean/Director will consult with the appropriate Provost/ Vice President before giving verbal approval to invite candidates to campus.
<dt><br>
			<dt>v)	Filing of the "Request to Invite Candidate to Campus" Form (one for each candidate who will be invited to visit the campus).  Candidates may not be invited until the request has been approved by the Dean/Director and Provost/Vice President (or designee).  Travel arrangements will be made by a local travel agent in consultation with the candidate and the department chair.  IMPORTANT:  This form must be filed BEFORE a candidate can be brought to campus!
</dl><!-- 3 -->
</dl><!-- 2 -->
	<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13D3">3</A>.	<i>THE ON-CAMPUS INTERVIEW</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>In order to hire from the strongest possible pool, it is important to invite candidates to campus as soon as possible.  For faculty searches, this may mean that candidates can be brought to campus during the first semester.
<dt><br>
		<dt>The Office of Human Resources' memorandum on "Recruitment Guidelines," deals with how to finance a search, what expenses can be paid, etc.  Recruitment costs have risen significantly in recent years and departments are expected to follow guidelines to help reduce recruitment-related expenses.
<dt><br>
		<dt>In addition to appropriate department personnel and committees, all candidates invited to campus must be scheduled to meet with:<br>
		<dt>a.	the appropriate dean/director<br>
		<dt>b.	a member of the Office of Human Resources<br>
		<dt>c.	students and others as determined by the department responsible for the position recruitment
<dt><br>
		<dt>If the candidate is a person of color, search chairs should contact the Assistant Vice President for Multicultural Affairs, who is eager to assist in the hiring process.  Her involvement can make candidates more aware of the support groups, services, and opportunities available, and improve the College's chances of hiring these candidates.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Please check with the Dean/Director's offices before inviting a candidate for specific days.  A copy of the candidate's vita and interview schedule must be made available to each interviewer prior to the interview.  Those persons conducting interviews should also be given an evaluation form.
<dt><br>
		<dt>An interview schedule should also be given to the candidate in advance of that person's arrival on campus.  The schedule often makes a lasting impression on the candidate.  Some suggested guidelines (which may appear all-too-obvious to most search committee chairs): schedules should be typed; schedules should be checked for accuracy in spelling, individuals' titles, etc.; proof schedules with an eye to how an outsider will view the professionalism of the hiring department (e.g. do not say "lunch with whoever (sic) in the Gallery"), allow time for a break during the interview.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Be sure to have written questions prepared ahead of time.  The department should have prepared a core set of questions to be asked of all candidates.  Care should be taken to avoid asking inappropriate questions.
<dt><br>
		<dt>As part of the interview process, all candidates interviewed for faculty positions on campus are expected to be placed in a 'teaching situation' involving faculty and students and appropriate to the discipline.  Generally, candidates should teach a scheduled class (except where not appropriate for some library positions).  This includes internal candidates, who should be asked to teach a class not in a course they are currently teaching.  If this is not possible, consider scheduling a "teaching simulation".  You can create a "class" of faculty and staff.  Search committee and faculty members should attend, their schedules permitting.  Interviews may give few clues as to teaching effectiveness, but a good (or bad!) teacher frequently can be identified in a teaching simulation.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Keep records as your search proceeds.  It is a good idea to keep minutes of search committee meetings.  Above all, retain candidate evaluation forms and all written comments.  This is particularly important when an internal candidate is a finalist for a tenure-track position.  All candidates must be afforded as equal as possible interview opportunities.

	<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13D4">4</A>.	<I>CONCLUDING THE SEARCH</I>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt>a)	Request to Hire Form:  Once the decision has been made as to whom to hire, a Request to Hire form must be completed including the information regarding the gender/racial/protected class composition of the applicant pool.  In some cases, the President or designee may request further information about the search process from the search committee before approving this form.  All the appropriate signatures must appear before the President or designee approves the final hiring.
 <dt><br>
		<dt>b)	Affirmative Action Cards:  The affirmative action cards are used to gather data for use in preparing the College's affirmative action plan.  To identify more clearly which affirmative action card goes with what vacancy, labels identifying the search will be prepared by Human Resources affixed to the affirmative action cards prior to their mailing to the search committee chair.  The cards will be mailed from the candidates directly to Human Resources.  Human Resources will forward the cards to the search committee chair upon receipt of the Request to Invite Candidates to Campus form.  The search committee chair will complete the affirmative action reporting on the back of the Request to Hire form.
<dt><br>
		<dt>c)	Search Records:  Each search committee chair should keep records and notes of evaluations of each candidate's credentials, reference checks, rating forms and interview results.  Upon the culmination of the search, all records and files should be completed and maintained for three years after the completion of the fiscal year in which the search was conducted.  These records will be used by the College in the event of a review by an outside agency (affirmative action, Department of Labor, etc.).  Such records must be retained in either the department office or returned to Human Resources.
<dt><br>
		<dt>d)	Every unsuccessful candidate who participated in an on-campus visit should be personally conducted by telephone, not just by letter.  If search committee chair does not do so, deans/directors should be informed so that they may do it.
<dt><br>
		<dt>e)	Hiring:  Search committee chairs should not discuss salaries with candidates or make offers of employment.  Assuming the department recommendation is accepted, the Dean/Director/Vice President/Provost/President will explore with the candidate his/her continuing interest in the position and salary expectations.  The Vice President/Provost or designee shall make the final salary offer.
</dl><!-- 2 -->
	<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13D5">5</A>.	<i>REIMBURSEMENT OF CANDIDATE EXPENSES</i>

		<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
<dt><A NAME="13D5a">a</A>)	Payment of Travel Expenses
<dt><br>
			<dt>Within available funds and within local and State of New York guidelines, candidates invited to campus for a position interview requiring travel in excess of 100 miles (one-way) may be reimbursed in full for expenses (transportation, meals, lodging, etc.).
<dt><br>
			<dt>Exceptions to these policies, where appropriate, must have prior approval of the President of the College.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Search Committees are requested to exercise careful management of recruitment monies for departments and divisions under their supervision.  This should include consultation with Chairperson/Directors and search committees as to specific recruitment costs and available resources.  Heads of search committees should meet with the Director of Human Resources at the start of every search to verify expected recruitment costs.  Chairpersons/Directors and heads of search committees are expected to exercise all possible economies, without damaging the effectiveness of their searches.

		<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="135b">b</A>)	Payment of Moving Expenses
<dt><br>
			<dt>The College, in general, does not reimburse new appointees for moving expenses.

<A NAME="13E">E</A>.	<b>SEXUAL HARASSMENT</b>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
	<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13E1">1</A>.	<i>INTRODUCTION</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>An atmosphere of mutual respect among members of the academic community is necessary for SUNY Potsdam to function as a center of academic freedom and intellectual advancement.  Any violation of mutual trust, any form of intimidation or exploitation, damages the institution's educational process by undermining the essential freedoms of inquiry and expression.  Students, teachers, and staff must feel personally secure for real learning to take place.
<dt><br>
		<dt>As a place of work and study, SUNY Potsdam must be free of sexual harassment an all forms of sexual intimidation and exploitation.  All students, staff, and faculty must be assured that the College will take action to prevent such misconduct and that anyone who engages in such behavior is subject to disciplinary procedures.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Sexual harassment is not simply inappropriate behavior; it is against the law.  Title VII (Section 703) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees from sexual harassment in that it is a form of unlawful sex discrimination.  title IX, enforced by the Office of Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education, protects both students and employees from sexual harassment in that it constitutes differential treatment on the basis of sex.  (Title IX applies to any educational institution receiving Federal funds.)

	<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13E2">2</A>.	<i>DEFINITION</i>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt>a)	Sexual harassment is characterized by the imposition of unwelcome sexual activity including:<br>
			<dt>--	unwelcome sexual advances,<br>
			<dt>--	requests for sexual favors,<br>
			<dt>--	and other intimidating verbal or written communications or physical conduct of a sexual nature.
<dt><br>
		<dt>b)	Such unwelcome sexual activity often occurs in relationships of unequal power, between a faculty member and student or supervisor and employee.
<dt><br>
			<dt>Consenting romantic and sexual relationships between a faculty member and student, or supervisor and employee, while not expressly forbidden, are generally deemed unwise.  A faculty member who enters into a sexual relationship with a student (or a supervisor with an employee) where a professional power differential exits, must realize that, if a charge of sexual harassment is subsequently lodged, it will be exceedingly difficult to prove a defense on grounds of mutual consent.
<dt><br>
		<dt>c)	Such unwelcome sexual activity also occurs in relationships of equal power:  between colleagues or between students.  Sexual harassment can occur between a student and faculty member, with the latter as victim.
<dt><br>

<center><strong>XIII.  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</strong></center>
<BR>

<BR>
<dt><A NAME="13E4">4</A>.	<i>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Any student or employee who feels she or he may have been sexually harassed by another employee is strongly encouraged to report any episode(s) to the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action.
<dt><br>
		<dt>There are three established procedures for processing a sexual harassment complaint:<br>
		<dt>--	Informal Grievance Procedures;<br>
		<dt>--	Formal Procedures;<br>
		<dt>--	External Administrative or Judicial Proceedings (bypassing SUNY Potsdam's internal procedures).
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt>a)	Informal Grievance Procedure
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	The primary objective of all informal procedures is to discover and identify whether sexual harassment has in fact occurred.  To that end, a student or employee who feels she or he has been harassed by an employee is encouraged to consult with the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action.  Careful consideration of the definition of sexual harassment and a detailed review of the student's or employee's experience will take place.  Discussions at this informal level are treated as confidential.  No formal records are maintained, and the student or employee will be assured as much anonymity as possible.
<dt><br>
			<dt>ii)	A second goal is to explore with the student or employee the various alternatives available to her or him in response to the situation.  The ultimate goal is to support and assist the student or employee in implementing the approach chosen in order to reach a satisfactory resolution.
<dt><br>
			<dt>iii)	Both parties -- the complainant and the respondent (alleged harasser) -- have the right to appear with an advisor during any stage of the proceedings.  Advisors may accompany the parties for support and consultation but may not actively participate, i.e., speak in the proceedings.
<dt><br>
			<dt>iv)	Recommended actions include, but are not limited to:  a) a direct conversation between the student or employee and the alleged harasser, b) a letter written by the student or employee to the alleged harasser, and c) a conversation between the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action and the alleged harasser on behalf of the student or employee.
<dt><br>
			<dt>v)	Time frame
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 4 -->
				<dt>(a)	Employees must file a grievance within 45 calendar days following an alleged case of sexual harassment.
<dt><br>
				<dt>(b)	Students must file a grievance within 45 calendar days following an alleged case of sexual harassment; or, if accused is an instructor, 45 calendar days after a final grade is received if that date is later.
<dt><br>
				<dt>(c)	If resolution satisfactory to both parties is reached within 14 calendar days, the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action shall close the case and send a written notice to complainant and respondent.
<dt><br>
				<dt>(d)	If satisfactory resolution is not possible within 14 calendar days, the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action shall so notify grievant advising her/him of the right to proceed to next step internally or with appropriate agencies.
</dl><!-- 4 -->
</dl><!-- 3 -->
<dt><br>
		<dt>b)	Formal Grievance Procedure
<dt><br>
			<dt>The SUNY Grievance Procedure for Reviewing Allegations of Illegal Discrimination will be employed in cases of sexual harassment.  This procedure, which may be used by a SUNY student or an employee, provides an additional mechanism through which the University may identify and initiate procedures to eliminate incidents of illegal discrimination.
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 3 -->
			<dt>i)	Written Statement
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 4 -->
				<dt>(a)	A formal complaint of sexual harassment must include a written statement signed by the complainant specifying the incident(s) of sexual harassment.  The statement may be prepared by the complainant as a record of the complaint with assistance from the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action.  
<dt><br>
				<dt>(b)	Grievances must be filed with the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action.  The College will prevent retaliation against the complainant for filing a complaint.
</dl><!-- 4 --><BR>

			<dt>ii)	Time frame for Filing a Formal Grievance
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 4 -->
				<dt>(a)	Employees must file a grievance within 45 calendar days following an alleged case of sexual harassment.
<dt><br>
				<dt>(b)	Students must file a grievance within 45 calendar days following an alleged case of sexual harassment; or, if accused is an instructor, 45 calendar days after a final grade is received if that date is later.
<dt><br>
				<dt>(c)	Grievant must notify the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action within 10 calendar days from the date of notification by the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action that the issue cannot be resolved informally.
</dl><!-- 4 -->
<dt><br>
			<dt>iii)	Procedural Options
<dt><br>
				<dt>The grievant's statement, together with a statement from the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action, indicating that informal resolution was not possible, will be forwarded to the Chair of the Affirmative Action Committee within 5 days.  Within 7 calendar days of receipt, the Grievance Chair shall notify the grievant and President that a review of the matter will take place by an ad hoc tripartite committee.
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 4 -->
				<dt>(a)	Ad Hoc Tripartite Committee
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 5 -->
					<dt>(1)	The ad hoc tripartite committee shall consist of one member chosen by the President, one member chosen by the grievant and a third, who shall chair the Committee, chosen by the two designees.  If the respondent is other than the President, that respondent shall be consulted and the President or designee and the respondent together shall select a panel member.  Selection must be completed and written notification of designees submitted to the appropriate Grievance Chairperson within seven calendar days.
<dt><br>
					<dt>(2)	The tripartite committee shall review the matter, as appropriate and shall have the right to all relevant information and to interview witnesses, including the right to bring together complainant and respondent, if desirable.  Both complainant and respondent shall be permitted rebuttal to the written record compiled by the committee.
<dt><br>
					<dt>(3)	Within 21 calendar days from the formation of the committee, the chairperson of the tripartite committee shall submit an opinion to the campus president as to whether or not discrimination has occurred.
<dt><br>
					<dt>(4)	If a tripartite committee cannot be selected within 7 days, either because the grievant cannot agree on a third member, the grievance chairperson (and, in the latter case, grievant) shall be so notified within the period.
<dt><br>
					<dt>(5)	The grievant may, in such cases, request an outside hearing officer review the charge.  Such request must be made in writing by the grievant to the grievant chairperson within five days from notification that a campus tripartite committee cannot be formed.
<dt><br>
					<dt>(6)	The request for an outside hearing officer shall be made in writing by the grievant to the appropriate grievance chairperson.  The chairperson shall submit a written statement within 5 days to the Executive Assistant to the Chancellor for Affirmative Action requesting that an outside hearing officer be appointed.  The written request shall include a copy of the original grievance statement and the reason an outside hearing officer is being requested.  An affirmative action officer from another SUNY campus shall be assigned as hearing officer.
<dt><br>
					<dt>(7)	The Executive Assistant to the Chancellor for Affirmative Action shall designate a hearing officer within 7 calendar days of receipt of the written request.
<dt><br>
					<dt>(8)	The hearing officer shall conduct a review and shall submit an opinion to the President within 21 calendar days from the date of appointment.  The hearing officer shall have the right to all relevant information and to interview witnesses, including the right to bring together complainant and respondent, if desirable.
<dt><br>
					<dt>(9)	The President or designee shall communicate the opinion of the  tripartite committee or of the hearing officer verbatim and in writing to the grievant and to the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action within 7 calendar days together with a statement indicating his/her acceptance or rejection of the committee's recommendation.  The President will indicate his/her decision either to dismiss the charge for lack of evidence that unlawful discrimination has occurred or to discuss appropriate redress with the grievant if unlawful discrimination has been found.
</dl><!-- 5 -->
<dt><br>
				<dt>(b)	Off-campus Resolution of Grievances:  (External Administrative or Judicial Proceedings).
<dt><br>
					<dt>If the grievant is dissatisfied with the President's response, the grievant may file a formal complaint with:  a) New York State division of Human Rights, b) the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, c) the Office of Federal Contract Compliance of the Department of Labor.     
<dt><br>
				<dt>(c)	Student Judicial Process: (See student conduct code)
</dl><!-- 4 -->
</dl><!-- 3 -->
</dl><!-- 2 -->
	<dt>
<dt><A NAME="13E5">5</A>.	<i>RECOMMENDED CORRECTIVE ACTION</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The purpose of any action to resolve a complaint will be to correct or to remedy the injury, if any, to the complainant and to prevent further harassment.  Recommended action may include written or verbal reprimand of the harasser; suspension, dismissal, or transfer of the harasser; a change of grade or other academic record for a student who has been the victim of harassment; a change in personnel action (such as a promotion) for an employee who has been victimized; or other appropriate action with the understanding that the imposition of sanctions against an employee can occur only after completion of contractual disciplinary procedures.

	<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13E6">6</A>.	<i>FALSE CHARGES</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>If it has been determined that a complaint was made by a student with the knowledge that the facts were false, the President or designee shall so notify the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Services.  In the case of a false complaint made knowingly by an employee, this finding shall be stated in the recommendation to the President for possible disciplinary action.

<A NAME="13F">F.</A>	<b>RACIAL AND ETHNIC HARASSMENT</b>

	<blockquote><dt>
<dt><A NAME="13F1">1</A>.	<i>INTRODUCTION</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>An atmosphere of mutual respect among members of the academic community is necessary for SUNY Potsdam to function as a center of academic freedom and intellectual advancement.  Any violation of mutual trust, any form of intimidation or exploitation, damages the institution's educational process by undermining the essential freedoms of inquiry and expression.  Students, teachers, and staff must feel personally secure for real learning to take place.
<dt><br>
		<dt>As a place of work and study, SUNY Potsdam must be free of racial and ethnic harassment and all forms of racial and ethnic intimidation and exploitation.  All students, staff, and faculty must be assured that the Collage will take action to prevent such misconduct and that anyone who engages in such behavior is subject to disciplinary procedures.

			<dt><br>
	<dt>4)	Off-campus Resolution of Grievances:  (External Administrative or Judicial Proceedings).
<dt><br>
				<dt>If the Grievance is dissatisfied with the President's response, the Grievance may file a formal complaint with:  a) New York State Division of Human Rights, b) the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, c) the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. or N.Y. State Department of Education and Office of Federal Contract Compliance of the Department of Labor.
<dt><br>
			<dt>5)	Procedure for Processing Grievances:
<dt.<br>
<dd><dl><!-- 4 -->
				<dt>a)	The Assistant to President for Affirmative Action shall receive any complaint of alleged harassment, shall assist the complainant with information about the various internal and external mechanisms through which the complaint may be filed, including applicable time limits for filing with each agency.
<dt><br>
				<dt>b)	If the complainant chooses to use the Potsdam Grievance Procedure for the Review of Allegations of Illegal Discrimination, the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action shall assist the complainant in filling out the appropriate form, signing and dating a copy of the completed form for the complainant.
<dt><br>
				<dt>c)	Once a form has been filled, the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action will notify respondent as soon as possible that a complaint has been filed against him/her.
<dt><br>
				<dt>d)	The Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action shall seek to resolve the complaint informally and shall have the right to all relevant information and to interview witnesses, including the right to bring together complainant and respondent, if desirable.  If a resolution satisfactory to both complainant and respondent is reached within 14 calendar days through the efforts of the Assistant to President for Affirmative Action, the officer shall close the case, sending a written notice to that effect to the complainant and respondent.  The written notice, a copy of which shall be attached to the original complaint form in the officer's file, shall indicate the agreement reached by complaint form in the officer's file, shall indicate the agreement reached by complainant and respondent and shall be signed and dated by the complainant, the respondent and the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action.
<dt><br>
				<dt>e)	If the Assistant to President for Affirmative Action is unable to resolve the complaint to the mutual satisfaction of the Grievance and respondent within 14 calendar days, the officer shall notify the Grievance, advising Grievance of his or her right to proceed to the next step internally or to file with appropriate enforcement agencies immediately.
<dt><br>
				<dt>f)	If a formal complaint with a state or federal agency or a court action is filed by a Grievance, any internal investigation or review underway on the same complaint will terminate without conclusion, except that if internal investigation is prolonged to the point that the statute (180 days for EEOC and OCR complaints; 365 days for Division of Human Rights complaints), a charge may be filed with the appropriate agency without interruption of the internal procedure.
<dt><br>
				<dt>g)	If the Grievance chooses to proceed through the formal internal grievance procedure, the Grievance shall notify the Assistant to the President for Affirmative Action and respondent in writing within 10 calendar days from the time of notification by the Assistant to President for Affirmative Action that the issue cannot by resolved informally.

</dl><!-- 2 -->
	<dt>
<dt><A NAME="13F5">5</A>.	<i>RECOMMENDED CORRECTIVE ACTION </i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The purpose of any action to resolve a complaint will be to correct or to remedy the injury, if any, to the complainant and to prevent further harassment.  Recommended action may include written or verbal reprimand of the harasser; suspension, dismissal, or transfer of the harasser; a change of grade or other academic record for a student who has been the victim of harassment; a change in personnel action (such as a promotion) for an employee who has been victimized; or other appropriate action with the understanding that the imposition of sanctions against an employee can occur only after completion of contractual disciplinary procedures.

	<dt><br>
<dt><A NAME="13F6">6</A>.	<i>FALSE CHARGE</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>If it has been determined that a complaint was made by a student with knowledge that the facts were false, the President or designee shall so notify the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Services.  In the case of a false complaint made knowingly by an employee, this finding shall be stated in the recommendation to the President for possible disciplinary action.

	<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
	<dt><A NAME="13H1">1</A>.	<i>DEFINITION</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>A "Special Disabled Veteran," is defined by law as a person who is entitled to compensation (or who but for the receipt of military retired pay would be entitled to compensation) under the laws administered by the Veterans Administration for a disability rated at 30 percent or more; or rated at 10 to 20 percent in the case of a veteran who has been determined under Section 1506 or Title 38, U.S. Code, to have a serious employment handicap; or a person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.
<dt><br>
		<dt>The term "serious employment handicap" means a significant impairment of a veteran's ability to prepare for, obtain, or retain employment consistent with such veteran's abilities, aptitudes, and interests.
<dt><br>
		<dt>The term "Veteran of the Vietnam Era," means a person: (a) who (i) served on active duty for a period of more than 180 days, any part of which occurred during the Vietnam Era (that is, between August 5, 1964 and May 7, 1975), and was discharged or released therefrom with other than a dishonorable discharge, or (ii) was discharged or released from active duty for a service-connected disability if any part of such active duty was performed during the Vietnam Era, and (b) who was so discharged or released within 48 months preceding his application for employment or the alleged violation of the Act, Affirmative Action clause and/or the regulations issued pursuant to the Act.
<dt><br>
		<dt>No veteran may be considered to be a veteran of the Vietnam Era after December 1, 1991.

	<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="13H2">2</A>.	<i>STATEMENT OF POLICY</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 prohibits job discrimination and requires Affirmative Action to employ and advance in employment:  (1) qualified Vietnam Era Veterans during the first four years of their discharge, and (2) qualified disabled veterans throughout their working lives if they have a 30 percent or more disability.
          <dt><br>
		<dt>In accordance with such requirements and with SUNY Potsdam's own policies and programs of equal opportunity and nondiscrimination, the College supports the law which provides that disabled and other veterans of the military services should be given every opportunity to employment and promotion, commensurate with their ability and qualifications to perform the specific jobs for which they may be considered.  This program will be reviewed and updated annually and any significant changes in procedures or rights or benefits as a result of the annual updating will be communicated to employees and applicants for employment.
<dt><br>
		<dt>It is the policy of SUNY Potsdam that no qualified Disabled Veteran or Veteran of the Vietnam Era shall be excluded from College employment or be subject to discrimination in such employment.  The College will employ, advance in employment and otherwise treat Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era Veterans without discrimination in all employment practices including, but not limited to advertising, recruitment, employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer, layoff or termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and selection for training.

<dt><br>
			<dt>The term "Qualified Disabled Individual" means a handicapped individual as defined above who is capable of performing the essentials functions of a particular job, with reasonable accommodation to his or her handicap.
</dl><!-- 2 -->
	<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="13I2">2</A>. 	<i>STATEMENT OF POLICY</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides that no otherwise qualified handicapped individual, as defined in Section 7(6) of that Act, shall, solely by reason of his/her disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
<dt><br>
		<dt><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990">The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990</A> prohibits discrimination against individuals in employment, public service, public accommodations, transportations and telecommunications.
<dt><br>
		<dt>In accordance with such requirements and with the College's own policies and programs of equal opportunity and non- discrimination, the College has adopted this revised Affirmative Action Plan for Disabled Persons.  It supports the law which provides that qualified disabled persons should be given every opportunity for employment, training and promotion commensurate with their ability and qualifications to perform the specific jobs for which they may be considered.  This program will be reviewed and updated annually and any significant changes in procedures and rights or benefits as a result of the annual updating will be communicated to employees and applicants for employment.
<dt><br>
		<dt>It is the policy and intent of SUNY Potsdam that no otherwise qualified disabled individual shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded from participation in employment or be subject to discrimination as a result of such employment.
<dt><br>
		<dt>The College will not discriminate against any employee or applicant because of physical or mental disability in regard to any position for which the employee or applicant for employment is qualified.

<dt><br>
	<A NAME="13J">J</A>.	<b>THE AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT</b>

	<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
	<dt><A NAME="13J1">1</A>.	<i>POLICY AND INTENT</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>The Age Discrimination in Employment Act was passed by Congress in 1967 to provide legal protection for the employment rights of people from 40 to 65 years old.  Congress amended the Act in 1978 to extend protection to 70 years of age, and further amended it in 1986 to abolish mandatory retirement at any age by removing the upper limit on the protected age group under the statute.
          <dt><br>
		<dt>It is unlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire, to discharge or otherwise to discriminate because of age against any individual between ages 40 and 70 with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.  This includes practices that are neutrally applied with no intent to discriminate, but which have a discriminatory impact on older employees or applicants and are not justified by business necessity.
<dt><br>
		<dt>It is also unlawful to limit, segregate, or classify employees, or to classify or refuse to refer for employment any individual, in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual who is at least 40 years of age of employment opportunities, or otherwise adversely affect his or her status as an employee or as an applicant for employment, because of such individual's age.
<dt><br>
		<dt>With the exception of executive and high policy making employees at least 65 years of age and who have been employed during a two-year period before retirement in such capacity and who are entitled to an immediate nonforfeitable employer-financed pension or deferred compensation plan of at least $44,000 per year, it is unlawful to forcibly retire an employee.
<dt><br>
		<dt>It is also unlawful to run help-wanted advertisements that indicate any preference, limitation, specification, or discrimination based on age.  (Example:  It is unlawful to specify in advertisements that an organization will hire only persons receiving social security benefits.)
<dt><br>
		<dt>It is unlawful to give preference because of age to one person over another within the age 40 to 70 protected group.  (Example:  It is unlawful to give preference to a 45-year-old job applicant over a 60-year-old-job applicant solely because of age.)

	<dt><br>
	<dt><A NAME="13J2">2</A>.	<i>AGE ACT EXEMPTIONS</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Age Act exemptions apply when:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 2 -->
		<dt>a)	Age is a bona fide job qualification (BFOQ) reasonably necessary to the normal operations of a particular business.  (Example:  public safety concern relating to piloting of commercial aircraft; modeling of clothes for teen-agers.)
<dt><br>
		<dt>b)	Differentiations are based on reasonable factors other than age.  (Example:  Use of physical examinations were stringent physical requirements are necessary to perform the work.)
<dt><br>
		<dt>c)	Differentiations are based on the terms of a bona fide seniority system or bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement pension, or insurance plan which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the Act.
<dt><br>
		<dt.d)	An employee is discharged or otherwise disciplined for good cause.
</dl><!-- 2 -->
</dl>
<dt>
	<A NAME="13K">K</A>.	<b>CHANNELS FOR DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS </b>
<dt><br>
	<dt>Resolution of difficulties through informal meetings of the parties is encouraged.  There are procedures for complaints alleging discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, handicap, marital status and, by reference, status as a disabled veteran or Veteran of the Vietnam Era.  These are available from the Assistant to President for Affirmative Action.

A.	<strong><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="A">CODE OF ETHICS</A></strong>

	<dt>All New York State employees are bound by a Code of Ethics designed to prevent conflict between personal interests and official duties.  A copy of the Code, taken from the Public Officers Law, is included as <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="../Appendices/APPEN04.html">Appendix IV</A>
<dt><br>
B.	<b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="b">ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT</A></b>
  <dt><br>
	<Dt>The Ethics in Government Act (1987) represents a commitment to integrity and accountability in our government.  The Act is designed to prevent conflict between personal interests and official duties of State officers and employees.  The Act places limitations on outside activities by State policy-makers only. Rules governing outside activities are given in <A HREF="../Appendices/APPEN06.html">Appendix VI. </A>
<dt><br>
 C.	<strong><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="c">AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</A> </strong>
<dt><br>
	<dt>New York State's policy is that equal opportunity be assured in the State's personnel system and affirmative action provided in its administration, in accordance with the requirements of the State's Human Rights Law, the mandates of Title VII of the Federal Civil Rights Act, as amended, and the Governor's Executive Order No. 6 (1983).  The Department of Civil Service is responsible for enforcing that policy and for developing comprehensive statewide affirmative action policies, goals, objectives, and implementation strategies.  Each state agency is required to develop a written affirmative action program and include specific goals and timetables for the prompt achievement of full and equal employment opportunities for minorities, women, disabled persons, and Vietnam era veterans, at all occupational levels of State government.  The Governor's Executive Committee for Affirmative Action advises the Governor and assists the President of the Civil Service Commission in the formulation, coordination, and effective implementation of all State departments' and agencies' affirmative action programs.  A copy of Executive Order No. 6 is included as <A HREF="../Appendices/APPEN07.html">Appendix VII.</A>
<dt><br>
D.<strong>	<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="d">SEXUAL HARASSMENT</A> </strong>
 <dt><br>
	<dt>A statewide policy declares that the State will not tolerate sexual harassment in the workplace.  Sexual harassment is considered a form of employee misconduct.  The State has served notice that it will impose sanctions on individuals engaging in such conduct and on supervisory and managerial personnel who knowingly allow such behavior to continue.  As with other cases of discrimination, formal complaints should be handled through the affirmative action officer.  A copy of New York State's policy statement on sexual harassment, Executive Order No. 19, in included as <A HREF= "../Appendices/APPEN08.html:>Appendix VIII.</A>
<dt><br>
E.	<strong><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="e">SEXUAL ORIENTATION</A> </strong>
<dt><br>     
	<dt>Executive Order No. 28 asserts that all State agencies and departments shall prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in any matter related to State employment and shall not discriminate on such basis in the provision of services or benefits.
<dt><br>
	<dt>The Office of Employee Relations was charged with the establishment of guidelines and implementation of procedures for handling complaints to ensure that such discrimination is prevented.  Investigations into complaints of discrimination are conducted with particular regard for confidentiality.

<dt><br>
F.	<strong><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="f">DISABLED VETERANS AND VETERANS OF THE VIETNAM ERA</A> </strong>
<dt><br>
	<dt>Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 prohibits job discrimination and requires Affirmative Action to employ and advance in employment:  (1) qualified Vietnam Era Veterans during the first four years after their discharge, and (2) qualified disabled veterans throughout their working lives if they have a 30 percent or more disability.
<dt><br>
G.	<strong><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="g">DISABLED PERSONS</A> </strong>
<dt><br>    
	<dt>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides that no  otherwise qualified disabled individual, as defined in Section 7(6) of that Act, shall, solely by reason of his/her disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.  The Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in employment, public service, public accommodation, transportation, and telecommunications. 
<dt><br>
H.	<strong><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="h">AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT</A> </strong>
<dt><br>
	<dt>The Age Discrimination in Employment Act was passed by Congress in 1967 to provide legal protection for the employment rights of people from 40 to 65 years old.  Congress amended the Act in 1978 to extend protection to 70 years of age, and further amended it in 1986 to abolish mandatory retirement at any age by removing the upper limit on the protected age group under the statute.

<dt>I.	<strong><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="i">GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES</A> </strong>
<dt><br>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1.	<i><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="1">MANAGERIAL/CONFIDENTIAL EMPLOYEES (M/C)</A></i>
<dt><br>
	<dt>Executive Order No. 42 establishes procedures for the submission, review, and settlement of M/C grievances.  An M/C employee has the right to grieve matters free from interference, coercion, restraint, discrimination, or reprisal.  An employee may present his or her case at each step established by the grievance procedure and is entitled to representation at each of these steps.  A copy of the Executive Order is included as <A HREF="../Appendices/APPEN10.html>Appendix X.</A>
<dt><br>    
		<Dt>The initial steps are handled within the employee's agency, beginning with the supervisor and ending with the appointing authority.  The final step of an appeal is heard by the three member Grievance Appeals Board, composed of non-State employees.  The Board reviews those appeals it deems appropriate and may require the personal appearance of the grievant and others.  A copy of the procedures covering M/C employees is available from the Office of Human Resources.

<dt><br>
		<dt>With the advent of collective negotiations between the state and employee organizations pursuant to the Public Employees' Fair Employment Act of 1967 negotiated agreements have been entered into which provide for grievance procedures.  Such procedures covering all UUP employees are provided under Article 7 of the Agreement.</BLOCKQUOTE>

J.	<strong><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="j">POLITICAL ACTIVITIES BY STATE OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES </A></strong>

	<dt>While a New York State employee is not discouraged from participating in the political process, there must be a clear separation between his/her political activities and the proper discharge of duties as a State employee.  No employee is to conduct political activities on paid State time.  In addition, State equipment, vehicles and office space are to be used only for official business.
<dt><br>
	<dt>Further, an employee of New York State shall not use his/her official authority to influence the political action of any person.  Nor shall appointment to or removal from an office, in any manner, be affected by one's political affiliations Section 107 of the Civil Service Law and Sections 17-156 and 17-158 of the Election Law specify these prohibitions, copies of which are included as <A HREF="../Appendices/APPEN16.html"> Appendix XVI. </A>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="11A9a">a</a>)	Purpose
<dt><br>
			<dt>The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is a confidential referral program which offers assistance to employees to cope with personal problems which negatively affect their lives and which might intrude upon their jobs.  Emotional stress, family disintegration, financial and legal difficulties, alcoholism, drug abuse and marital disruption impair not only an employee's personal life, but workplace productivity.  EAP was formed with the knowledge that such problems can be addressed and treated with appropriate help.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="11A9b">b</a>)	Service Provided
<dt><br>
<dt>EAP is a confidential information, support and referral service.  It is not a counseling service, nor does it provide treatment.  Using the referral services of EAP is not a condition of employment.  Depending upon the nature of the problem, employees seeking assistance are referred to a program, service or agency within the community for appropriate counseling or assistance.
<dt><br>
<Dt>Involvement in this program is entirely voluntary and services of EAP are free of charge.  Employee benefits may cover the expenses of other referral agencies.
<dt><br>
<dt>The SUNY Potsdam EAP office is located in Morey Hall, Room 105.  Employees calling EAP are not restricted to Potsdam coordinators.  Any EAP coordinator from any state agency can be contacted.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="11A9c">c</a>)	Eligibility And Referral
<dt><br>
			<dt>The EAP is open to all College and PACES employees, retirees and their families.  An employee may enter EAP through self- referral, supervisor referral, or a third party (family member, union representative, friend, co-worker, clergy, etc.)
<dt><br>
<dt>It is important to remember that the final decision to contact the Employee Assistance Program lies with the employee.  EAP is a voluntary option.

<CENTER><B>APPENDIX XIX<BR>
POLICY ON CONFLICT OF INTEREST</B></CENTER>
<dt><br>
I.     INTRODUCTION
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 0 -->
<dt>Consistent with the mission of the State University of New York, all faculty and staff are encouraged to pursue free and open inquiry and the unrestricted dissemination of knowledge.  Open exchange of scholarly knowledge is integral to SUNY's goals of instruction, research and scholarship, and public service.  Moreover, as members of a public university, the faculty and staff of SUNY have a responsibility to ensure integrity in all aspects of the performance of their assignments.
<dt><br>
<dt>This policy represents a restatement of existing University policy and pertinent State and Federal law and regulations including:
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
<dt>Policies of the Board of Trustees, Article XI, Title H, Section 4; New York State Public Officers Law, Section 73-a, and 73 and 74; 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 50, Subpart F; and National Science Foundation, Grant Policy Manual (GPM), Section 310
</dl>
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dt>II.     DEFINITION
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 0 -->
<dt>--  A conflict of interest is any interest, financial or otherwise, direct or indirect; participation in any business, transaction or professional activity; or incurring of any obligation of any nature, which is or appears to be in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of an employee's duties in the public interest.  A conflict of interest is also any financial interest that will, or may be reasonably expected to, bias the design, conduct or reporting of sponsored research.
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dt>III.     POLICY
<dt><br>
<dd><dl><!-- 1 -->
<dt>Faculty and staff of the University are encouraged to foster an atmosphere of academic freedom by promoting the open and timely exchange of scholarly knowledge independent of personal interests.  In keeping with this obligation, they are also required to avoid conflicts of interest.  In instances where potential or actual conflicts exist, faculty and staff are expected to consult with appropriate University officials implementing this policy to identify potential or actual conflicts of interest and take appropriate steps to manage, reduce or eliminate them.
<dt><br>
<dt>1.  SUNY faculty and staff may not engage in other employment which interferes with the performance of their professional obligation (Policies of the Board of Trustees Article XI, Title H, Section 4).
<dt><br>
<dt>2.  SUNY faculty and staff are expected to comply with the New York State Public Officers Law provisions on conflict of interest and ethical conduct (Sections 73 and 74).
<dt><br>
<dt>3.  SUNY faculty and staff, to the extent required by law or regulation, shall disclose at minimum whether they (and their spouses and dependent children) have employment or financial interests or hold significant offices, in external organizations that may affect, or appear to affect, the discharge of professional obligations to the University (as required and subject to the limits of NYS Public Officer Law 73-a, and 73, 74; 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart F; and, NSF, GPM, Section 310).
<dt><br>
<dt>4.  SUNY campuses shall ensure that all faculty and staff subject to pertinent laws and regulations disclose financial interests in accordance with procedures to be established by the Chancellor or designee.  Campuses shall retain the reported information as required, identify actual or apparent conflicts of interest and seek resolution of such conflicts.
<dt><br>
<dt>5.  Each campus President shall submit to the System Provost the name and title of the person or persons designated as financial disclosure designee(s) and shall further notify the Provost when a change in that assignment occurs.  The Provost shall also be notified of any reports regarding Conflict of Interest that are forwarded to State or Federal agencies.

<B><CENTER>NEW YORK STATE ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT ACT</CENTER></B>
<BR>

NEW YORK STATE ETHICS COMMISSION RULES
<BR>
<BR>

A.	OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES
<BR>
<BR>

	Applicability
<BR>
<BR>

	The limitations on outside activities apply to State policy-makers only.  Within the University, policy-makers generally are considered to be those employees at the level of Dean and above at the campuses and Associate Vice Chancellor and above in the System Administration.
<BR>
<BR>

General Requirements
<BR>
<BR>

All policy-makers are prohibited from serving as an officer of a political party or political organization or as a member of a national committee of a political party.
<BR>
<BR>

The regulations further require that salaried policy-makers obtain the prior approval of the Campus President and the Ethics Commission before;

	<BLOCKQUOTE>-	holding other public office or engaging in other public employment for more than nominal compensation (defined as:  greater than the normal per diem or $4000 annually);
<BR>
<BR>

	-	engaging in any private employment, business or other activity (including not-for-profit) for more than the defined nominal compensation; and
<BR>
<BR>

	-	serving as director or officer of a for-profit corporation or institution, regardless of compensation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	Prior approval of limited to the Campus President is required when salaried policy-makers engage in private employment or other activity for annual compensation between $1000 and $4000.
<BR>
<BR>

Approval of any request to engage in outside activities must be based upon consistency of the activity with the ethical standards in sections 73 and 74 of the Public Officers Law booklet and a determination that the activity does not interfere or conflict with the proper and effective discharge of the employee's SUNY responsibilities (see also Policies of the Board of Trustees, Article XI, Title H, 4 (8 NYCRR 355.26)). 
<BR>
<BR>

Procedures for Requesting Approval

<BLOCKQUOTE>1.	Where both University and Commission approvals are required, requests are to be made on forms provided by the Ethics Commission.
<BR>
<BR>

	2.	At the campuses, request forms should be submitted first by affected employees to the President.  Requests for approval of outside activities involving a President should be submitted to the Executive Vice Chancellor.  Those requests approved on campus should be transmitted directly to the Ethics Commission for approval, with a copy to the Executive Vice Chancellor.  Approved requests of a President will be submitted to the Ethics Commission by the Executive Vice Chancellor.
<BR>
<BR>

	3.	Where approval of the University alone is required by the regulations (i.e., request involving annual compensation from a private business of between $1000 and $4000), the official form can be modified or approval may be requested on a letter submitted by the employee.  The same procedures as above should be followed except that no further approvals beyond the appropriate President is required.</BLOCKQUOTE>

B.	HONORARIA AND TRAVEL
<BR>
<BR>

	The regulations on receipt of honoraria and travel reimbursement apply to all compensated State employees, with the exception of academic employees in SUNY and CUNY engaging in activities within their academic discipline.
  <BR>
<BR>
   
	Honoraria
<BR>
<BR>

Under the regulations, an honorarium is defined as a "payment, fee, or other compensation made as a gratuity or as an award or honor" for services rendered by a covered employee not related to the covered employee's official duties.  It also includes a payment for travel expenses incurred by the employee in the course of services unrelated to the employee's duties.  The regulations set forth specific conditions under which honoraria may be expected.
<BR>
<BR>

Obtaining prior approval of requests to receive honoraria is optional rather than mandatory.  Requests, if made, are subject only to University action and the filing of the determination with the Ethics Commission.  Employees receiving honoraria without prior approval of the University, however, are required to report annually (April 1) to their campus or System Administration, as appropriate, the source, date, amount, and nature of the activities for which honoraria were received in the previous year.  In turn, a compilation of individual reports must be filed with the Ethics Commission on an annual basis (June 1).  Employees who have obtained prior approval from the University of requests to receive honoraria need not file these annual reports.  No special form for submission of the request for prior approval or the annual report has been specified.
<BR>
<BR>

Requests for prior approval of honoraria or annual reports regarding honoraria should be submitted by affected employees to the President or the President's designee.  Requests or reports involving a President should be submitted to the Executive Chancellor.  The campus designee or Executive Vice Chancellor, as appropriate, will be responsible for filing approved advance requests for receipt of honoraria and annual reports with the Ethics Commission.	<BR>
<BR>
Travel Expense Reimbursement
<BR>
<BR>

	Advance approval by the campus is required for receipt of travel expense reimbursement related to an employee's official duties.  The same process described for advance approval of honoraria should be utilized for approval of travel reimbursement that complies with the criteria contained in the regulations.  No filing with the Ethics Commission are required.
<BR>
<BR>

Any honorarium or travel reimbursement received which is over $1000 must also be reported on an employee's annual financial disclosure statement, where filing of that form is required.
<BR>
<BR>

Any questions relating to the compliance with these regulations may be directed to the Office of University Counsel at (518) 443-5400.

<B><CENTER>APPENDIX XVIII
<BR>
<BR>

CHANCELLOR'S STATEMENT ON GOVERNANCE</CENTER></B>

<BR>

Following considerable discussion about the matter of enforcement of by-laws on local campuses, and following conferences among the Committee on Governance, the Executive Committee, the President's Council, and with the Board of Trustees, the Chancellor has developed the following Statement on Governance:
<BR>
<BR>

In the light of recent challenges to the basic structural elements of the University, I join with the Faculty Senate in affirming the validity of governance as the appropriate and organic process for the involvement of constituent groups in campus decision making.  By this statement, University faculty, staff, and administration are reminded of the charge contained in the 1972 Master Plan that "the governance arrangements within the university will be increasingly clarified and improved methods of consultation will be developed to reflect the need for effective governance based upon widespread participation.."
<BR>
<BR>

Since these challenges go to the very heart of the University, it is appropriate to underscore the traditional legal framework which establishes and protects University governance.
<BR>
<BR>

The Education Law established the Board of Trustees and charges it with the responsibility for and conduct of the University.  The Trustees, in turn, have promulgated The Policies of the Board of Trustees, et al that represent a constitution which provides basic principles of policy and organization.  The Policies of the Board of Trustees, et al vest authority in the Chancellor of the University and in campus presidents and legally established governance as the appropriate vehicle for the involvement of all constituents: faculty, staff, administration, and students.  In this regard, The Policies of the Board of Trustees, et al accord official recognition to the close interrelation between the exercise of the legal authority of the president and his or her obligation to accept constituent participation through governance.
<BR>
<BR>

Article X of The Policies of the Trustees, et al, among other provisions, empowers and directs the faculty to develop by-laws for the conduct of its affairs.  Substantive actions taken in the course of that conduct are advisory upon the president and are a recognition of his or her legal authority.  Furthermore, those provisions of by-laws concerning consultation--how, when, and where the president consults wit his faculty--are subject to his or her approval.  It is understood, of course, that by-laws often contain procedures for consultation among faculty in addition to provisions for presidential consultation with faculty.  The latter only is spoken to in Article X.
<BR>
<BR>

When the president accepts provisions of local by-laws concerning consultation, the Trustees, through Article X, and the Chancellor respect this endorsement and these provisions become, thereby, part of local policy and must provide a reliable framework for campus governance.  In this regard, a president is expected to adhere to policies which he or she has accepted for his or her administration.
<BR>
<BR>

Since governance must remain responsive to changing conditions on each campus, the validity of by-laws rests firmly upon the continuing confidence in which they are held.  By-laws, once approved, should not be used to require adherence to outmoded or bad practice by either the faculty or the president.  The campus community must remain ready to recognize legitimate objections to practices or procedures which no longer adequately meet the needs for which they were designed.  In order for governance to operate effectively, provisions must exist in each set of by-laws to permit the president and any constituent included in the governance vehicle to initiate review and modification when by-laws fail to command the confidence of those who are expected to observe them.
<BR>
<BR>

By-laws are the manifestation of the university's commitment to governance.  They have their legal basis in authorization by the Board of Trustees and their effectiveness results, in the most practical sense, from the confidence they enjoy in the campus community.  If governance is to survive, it must draw strength from its success in meeting the needs for which it was designed.  It must not rely upon external forces.  Its validity is adequately supported in the legal recognition of governance by the Trustees as essential to the proper conduct of a university.

                  GRIEVANCES PROCEDURES FOR STATE EMPLOYEES
<BR>
<BR>

                            EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 42</CENTER></B>
<BR>

     With the advent of collective negotiations between the State and employee organizations pursuant to the Public Employees' Fair Employment Act of 1967, collectively negotiated agreements ("collective agreements") have been entered into which provide for grievance procedures which are intended to supersede in whole or in part the grievance procedures provided for by the Executive Order heretofore issued on August 28, 1963.  Such negotiated grievance procedures are a milestone in the development of collective negotiations in the public sector.  Nevertheless, there is still an important reason for the continuation of procedures for the settlement of grievances of employees who are not covered by collective agreements or for the settlement of non-contract grievances which are outside of the scope of the grievance procedure set forth in any such collective agreement.
<BR>
<BR>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>1.   Every employee to whom this order applies shall have the right to           present his/her grievance in accordance with this order, free from interference, coercion, restraint, discrimination or reprisal.   He/she shall have the right to present his/her grievance individually or with a representative of his/her own choosing at all           steps of the grievance procedure hereunder, except that where there is in effect a collective agreement covering a negotiation unit which includes such employee which was entered into between the State and an employee organization, then such employee may not choose as his/her representative any employee organization other than the employee organization with which such agreement was negotiated nor may any employee organization other than the one with which such agreement was negotiated initiate or process a grievance except to the extent permitted by such agreement.
<BR>
<BR>

     2.   Grievance Appeals Board.  The Grievance Appeals Board established by  the executive order heretofore issued on August 28, 1963 shall be transferred to the Office of Employee Relations.  It shall consist of three members appointed by and who shall serve at the pleasure of the Director of Employee Relations.  No person regularly employed in a full time position in the State service shall be eligible for appointment to the Board.  One member shall be designated by the Director to serve as chairperson of the Board.  The compensation of the members of the Board shall be fixed by the Director with the approval of the Director of the Budget.
<BR>
<BR>

     3.   Departmental Procedures. The head of each State department or agency shall, subject to the approval of the Grievance Appeals Board established pursuant to this order, establish formal procedures for the submission of grievances by employees and for the prompt and orderly consideration and determination of such grievances by supervisors and the department or agency head.
<BR>
<BR>

   4.   Powers and Duties of the Grievance Appeals Board.  The Grievance Appeals Board is hereby charged with the responsibility for and empowered to: </BLOCKQUOTE>

          <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>a)  establish and maintain a program for resolving employee grievances relating to conditions of employment in the State service not inconsistent with the State's obligations as an employer under the Public Employee's Fair Employment Act of 1967 or collective agreements entered into thereunder.
<BR>
<BR>

          b)  promulgate and amend from time to time, with the approval of the  Director of Employee Relations, such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this order and to review and approve grievance procedures established by  departments and agencies pursuant to this order and such regulations, including provisions for reasonable time off without charge to leave credits for grievants, representatives and witnesses.
<BR>
<BR>

          c)  hold hearings, to conduct investigations, to require the attendance of officers and employees of the State as witnesses and to require the production or examination of records, books and papers of State departments or agencies relating to administration of the grievance procedure.
<BR>
<BR>

          d)  render advice and assistance to officers and employees of State  departments and agencies in any matter relating to the establishment or use of the procedures provided for or adopted pursuant to this order or the regulations issued thereunder.
<BR>
<BR>

          e)  report to the Director of Employee Relations for appropriate  action the failure of any department or agency to establish properly or maintain satisfactorily the standards, principles,  determinations and procedures embodied in or authorized by this order.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>5.   Appeals.  An employee within a time limit and upon compliance with the regulations of the Board, may appeal to the Board from a determination made pursuant to this order by the head of his department or agency, or his designated representative, as the case may be.  The Board shall conduct such review of the appeal as it deems appropriate and may require the appearance before it of the appellant and other parties to the grievance; provided, however,  that the appellant shall be entitled upon his/her request to a hearing before the Board or its designee.  If the appeal involves the enforcement of a law, a civil service rule or regulation or a written rule, regulation or order of a department or agency, the findings of fact and the recommendation of the Board shall be transmitted to the departments or agencies involved for appropriate action in accordance with the facts found by the Board.  In all           other cases, the determination of the Board shall contain a statement of the facts and an advisory recommendation to the departments or agencies involved.  Copies of the determination of the Board shall be sent to the employee involved, to his representative and to the Director of Employee Relations.
<BR>
<BR>

     6.   Application</BLOCKQUOTE>

          <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>a)  The provisions of this order shall apply to employees in the executive branch of the State government (1) who are not covered               by a collective agreement between the State and a certified or recognized employee organization or (2) who are covered by a collective agreement which accords such employees the right to continue to process grievances under this order.
<BR>
<BR>

          b)  The provisions of this order and the procedures established hereunder shall be applicable to grievances in any department or agency claiming an act or omission resulting in an injustice to an employee or arising out of conditions which are in whole or in part subject to the control of the head of such department or agency and which involve alleged safety or health hazards, unsatisfactory physical facilities, surroundings, materials or equipment, unfair or discriminatory supervisory and disciplinary practice, unjust treatment by fellow workers, unreasonable assignment of working hours or personal time allowances, unfair or unreasonable work quotas, and all other grievances relating to conditions of employment; provided, however, that this order shall not apply to matters which are reviewable under administrative procedures established by law or under the rule of the State Civil Service Commission, or the rules of other department or agencies having the force and effect of law or rules governing grievances of employees in the professional service of the State University of New York as defined in Section 355-a of the Education Law, or grievance concerning the interpretation, application or claimed violation of a specific               term or provision of a collective agreement between the State and an employee organization.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>7.   Repeal of Previous Order.  The Executive Order heretofore issued on August 28, 1963 is hereby revoked and superseded by this executive order.  Grievances initiated but not finally resolved prior to the effective date of this order may be continued under the terms of the executive order issued on August 28, 1963.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<TITLE>Appendix IX Sexual Orientation</TITLE>

                               <B><CENTER>APPENDIX IX
<BR>
<BR>

                              SEXUAL ORIENTATION
<BR>
<BR>

                            EXECUTIVE ORDER No. 28</CENTER></B>
<BR>

     Ours is a unique government.  It was created and has been preserved by people from all over the world who came here seeking one thing above all others:  freedom--freedom to believe and to act on those beliefs; freedom that says that so long as an individual's conduct and actions remain a matter of personal expression and do not deprive others of their rights, they should be neither restrained nor punished by government.
<BR>
<BR>

     Our nation values freedom so greatly, it has been written into our Constitution.  We all prize that freedom and millions have fought to protect and to extend it.
<BR>
<BR>

     Each generation has come to understand the basic wisdom of our Constitution:  that only by protecting the freedom of others can we ensure it for ourselves; that to encourage or allow government to discriminate against any belief or creed or private way of life would threaten us all.  This is so because we could never be sure which particular value would dominate government at any particular point in time.  Only neutrality by government was deemed safe and that is what our Constitution assures.
<BR>
<BR>

     This freedom makes us strong.  It is essential to our pluralism.  It protects religious believers, and agnostics, and atheists, and political dissenters, and conservatives and liberals, creating a nation and a state where the right to live as conscience dictates is enshrined as law.  Because of such freedom we enjoy a cultural and religious diversity unmatched by any other nation.
<BR>
<BR>

     The freedom our Constitution grants, however, requires that government exercise a degree of tolerance unthinkable in societies less open or diverse than ours.  It demands a tolerance for the privacy of each individual, a refusal to use the state as an instrument of coercion of belief or thought, however desirable the majority regards a particular belief or thought to be.
<BR>
<BR>

     Even when this freedom is unchallenged, it is so precious to us all that our commitment to preserve it from encroachment by government deserves constant reaffirmation and reiteration.  But when this freedom is questioned or when evidence of unfair discrimination exists, then our reaffirmation is not an option--it is a simple necessity.
<BR>
<BR>

     I have seen evidence of such encroachment.  As Secretary of State, I was required to issue special regulations to prohibit discrimination against individuals seeking licenses for certain occupations or corporate privileges.  Up to that time such licenses were denied on the basis of sexual orientation or even presumed sexual orientation.  There is no reason to believe that the discrimination apparent in the part of government was confined there.
<BR>
<BR>

    No one argued then against my change in the State's regulations.  No one was heard to say that government had no place in fighting unfair discrimination.  In fact, in recognition of this, a personnel directive against discrimination in hiring was issued during the prior administration.
<BR>
<BR>

     I suggest, respectfully, that what was right then is right now.  And I believe that there is no justification for the failure to announce freedom from discrimination as the policy, not just of the Department of State but of this entire State government.
<BR>
<BR>

     Indeed, the most persistent argument that has been offered in opposition to my stating the views contained in this Order does not really contradict any of them.  Rather it says, in effect, we ought not to state this constitutional truth because it may be misrepresented to be something else.  Specifically, it is suggested that the argument against discrimination will be distorted into an argument promoting homosexuality.  
<BR>
<BR>

     The argument is beside the mark.  There is no perfect protection against distortion.  Indeed one could as easily argue that silence on this issue could be distorted into an argument promoting discrimination against homosexuals.
<BR>
<BR>

     In this case, this statement and Executive Order are clear.  Their essence is that our government cannot promote any religion, creed, belief or life-style without thereby threatening all others.
<BR>
<BR>

     This is an argument for securing freedom by insisting on neutrality.  It is a proposition that is at the very foundation of our nation's strength.  We ought never be embarrassed nor afraid to repeat it.
<BR>
<BR>

     Accordingly, for all the above reasons, I am this day reiterating the law set down by the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of New York as the policy of this Administration.
<BR>
<BR>

A.   Statement of Policy
<BR>
<BR>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>1.   No state agency or department shall discriminate on the basis of           sexual orientation against any individual in the provision of any services or benefits by such State agency or department.
<BR>
<BR>

     2.   All State agencies and departments shall prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in any matter pertaining to employment by the State including, but not limited to, hiring, job appointment, promotion, tenure, recruitment and compensation.
<BR>
<BR>

     3.   The Office of Employee Relations is hereby directed to promulgate clear and consistent guidelines prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation to maintain an environment where only job-related criteria are used to assess employees or prospective employees of the State.  The Office shall also implement a procedure to ensure the swift and thorough investigation of complaints of discrimination based on sexual orientation.  Particular effort should be made to conduct investigations with due regard for confidentiality.
<BR>
<BR>

    4.   In order to assure that we understand fully the extent and nature of any discrimination that exists, I will appoint a Task Force, including the Commissioners of the Departments of Correctional Services, Health, Mental Health, Labor, Social Services and the Division of Human Rights, the Superintendent of State Police, the President of the Civil Service Commission, the Directors of the Women's Division, the Office of Employee Relations, the Division for Youth and the Office for the Aging, the Chairman of the State Liquor Authority and seven private citizens whom I shall designate.  The Task Force shall submit such reports and recommendations as it sees fit, dealing with individuals' rights to the benefit of government services and opportunity for government service regardless of sexual orientation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

     I shall designate a Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson of the Task Force.  Its members shall receive no compensation, but shall be entitled to reimbursement for any necessary expenses incurred directly in connection with the performance of their duties.

                   <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>GIVEN under my hand and the Privy Seal of the State  in the City of New York this 18th day of November in the year one thousand nine hundred eighty-three.</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

                         /s/Michael J. Del Guidice<BR>

<DD>     <DD>     <B><I><!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#199161">Pedagogy:</FONT></I></B>  This lesson is directed towards being an introduction to the Oswegatchie River Project.  The MST students, during the summer of 1996, spent two weeks designing a framework of short-term (four months long) goals for the Gouverneur Jr. High students.   Science concepts were selected and modified to be deemed appropriate.  Also, the method(s) of teaching have been determined to allow for a solid base in understanding and learning, and to maintain this base throughout the semester.  Because as many as four of us may be teaching simultaneously, we are serving to model the importance of cooperative learning, both academically and socially.<BR><BR>
<DD>     <DD>     
<DD>     <DD>     <STRONG><EM><B><!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#199161">Phase 1</FONT></B>:</EM></STRONG>
<DD>     <DD>       As teachers, we would like the students to begin this project with 15-20 minutes of talking about ourselves and getting to know each student.  After this, we would like to establish a set of rules and consequences, which the students will be responsible for, and if they are unrealistic, the teacher will modify them ( this may take 10-15 minutes).  An introduction to the content area will begin with the students asking themselves, "What role does this river play in my life?".   They will then write their answer in a required journal (5 minutes allotted for this activity).  The ultimate goal of this project is to perform multiple experiments and develop "higher" knowledge which provides the students with the experience and ability to change their preconceptions concerning the significance of the river to them.  To end the class, a brief discussion will entail a brainstorming session concerning  certain aspects which the students believe is important in a town's location and the components which allow a town to function, adding details related to their town, Gouverneur.     <BR><BR>

<DD>     <DD>      The students will continue the lesson, in groups of two,  looking at maps of the Oswegatchie River.  They will be taken to the library and given approximately 30 minutes to study the map.  In doing this, the students should be looking for a recognizable pattern, which would help to explain why Gouverneur is located exactly where it is on the river.  The teacher will know this has been accomplished by walking around and listening to the students talk together.  To allow the teacher to view the actual coherency of the students, they will be given another 15 minutes to complete a concept map, linking each aspect of the Oswegatchie River to another.  The concept maps will be put in their journals and handed in for overnight evaluation.  This provides the students with greater organization and prepares them for the Experiment, Making My City (<CITE>Outlook: The Earth </CITE> by McCalley. p.73).  At the end of the period, the students will be given a homework assignment.  The assignment will require the student to conduct an interview with an elderly person of the community.  Questions to ask may include: <BR>
<DD>     <DD>      <!-- List Tag --><DL>
<DD>     "How significant do you believe this river is to the town?" or "Has the river changed in regards to the amount of pollution, or the number of fish permitted to eat?"
</DL>  
<DD>     <DD>     This enables the student to get a personal outlook on the river and to make them realize that the river really is important to everyone, themselves included.<BR><P>

<DD>     <DD>     <STRONG><EM><B><!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#199161">Phase 3:</FONT></B></EM>
<DD>     <DD>      </STRONG>
<DD>     <DD>      The final class is allotted to the completion of Experiment, Making My City (<CITE>Outlook: The Earth  </CITE>by McCalley p.73).  The students will create a map of a town (to be as similar to Gouverneur as possible).  Still in their groups of two, a large piece of paper will be given to each group- to draw their maps on (35 minutes). This map will incorporate patterns found in the Oswegatchie River map and include components vital to a towns survival.  For example; farming provides food, the river provides power and recreation, and there must be a sewage/water treatment plant.  After the map is finished, the students will explain their reasons and compare their map to other students, possibly even explaining differences in specific locations.  The idea that there is no <STRONG>wrong</STRONG><STRONG>answer</STRONG> will be stressed. The teacher will ask certain questions to stimulate greater conversation within the class:<BR>
<DD>     <DD>     What is a town?<BR>
<DD>     <DD>     What is needed to make a town?<BR>
<DD>     <DD>       Now, the students will write about the importance of interaction in their journals (5 minutes).   The last 5 minutes of class, a questionnaire will be administered to assist in the determination of which students belong in what group; water quality or aquatic plants and animals.  It asks inquiring questions to find where the main interests of each student lies.  When the students are put in their appropriate group, the teaching will be directed toward a class consisting of 7/8 students, to provide a more personal atmosphere and to allow for more individual attention. <BR>
<DD>     <DD>     After the MST students meet at Gouverneur on Thursday, the following day the students will talk between each group; the water quality and the aquatic plants and animals.  This is the time to teach what they have learned and make it even more concrete in their minds.  Journals are also a required MUST!  Each student will write in their journals daily.  A topic will be given at the beginning of class, or at the end,  and they will write for 5 minutes. If we are in the field,  the students will comment on the weather and any other observations they make. <BR>

<DD>     <DD>     <P>The Ecosystem and Ecotones will be introduced to the class at this time. 
<DD>     <DD>      A vital concept we would like the student to realize is that all components of an 
<DD>     <DD>     ecosystem are different, yet they interact to live peacefully.  This is absolutely 
<DD>     <DD>     necessary to maintain an established equilibrium.</P>

<P>Journal Entry-  Write what you think of when you hear the word system (5 minutes).  The activity "Edge of Home" (<CITE>Project Aquatic</CITE>p. 68) will be finished before the students go into the field.  They will brainstorm to develop an idea about ecosystems (5-10 minutes), then paint 2 circles, each a different color.  The idea being that the students will see the interaction that occurs when the two circles intercept/overlap (20 minutes).  This will instill the fact that even though it is a segregated world, the two still meet.  When they enter the field, this concept will be present throughout the ecosystem, and will be able to recognize it.  This activity will also familiarize the students with the terms mentioned above.</P>

<P> The students will be in the field.  Upon arriving at the particular site, they will initiate their quadrants.  A quadrant will be chosen by each individual, and may be 1 meter by 1 meter.  There is only one requirement:  each student must pick the location that is unique in its characteristics. Possibly one is in the water, half in the water, close to the bank, farther away from the bank, etc...  Next, the students will chart and illustrate their quadrant in their journals(15 minutes).  They will also make any observations and record the necessary data ( weather, high or low life activity, fast or slow moving water, high or low water levels, etc...), including gathering and identifying species (10 minutes). The students have previously learned how to read a field guide, so only a brief review is needed (5 minutes).  A discussion about how each of these affects the other will occur after all is finished (15 minutes).</P>

<P>This is a classroom activity in which the students will compose ID cards for the Department of Environmental Conservation.  The information on the cards is obtained from the site work completed the day before, and includes the type of species, classified correctly, and the population of that species (20 minutes).   Finally, they will be asked to give a definition of what they think an ecosystem is.  The teacher will employ higher order questioning to direct the student toward a generative answer.  The students will also perform a group brainstorming session with the teacher constantly asking clarifying questions to aid them in the process (10 minutes).  The experiment "My Own Little World" will be started (it is found on the World Wide Web at the URL 
<DD>     <DD>     address:  http://207.22.231.50:80/nsta_scripts/List_SSC_byGrade.idc).<BR>
 The students will be given clean 1 liter Pepsi bottles and told to go outside and collect the following items: soil, 2-3 plants, small insects, dead leaves, 2-3 earthworms, and land snails(10 minutes).  Charcoal, thermometer, rainwater, clear tape and scissors will be provided.  The students will cut off the top of the bottle and add the above items to it.  The bottles will be dated and named on the bottom (5 minutes), and put away for use in a later lesson.</P>

This section is being revised into the above displayed task analysis format.  Please bear with us during this change.  Feel free to look over our thoughts listed below for a full description of our pedagogy according to the New Science Education <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.nap.edu/nap/online/nses/html/3.html">Teaching</A> and<!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.nap.edu/nap/online/nses/html/5.html#as"> Assessment</A> Standards.  Thank you.

The topic we want to cover, in detail, is pollution.  A very brief introduction will 
be done for this activity, the students will be performing most of the investigating 
themselves to aid in their learning and retaining the information.  We have been 
continuously reviewing different aspects of the water cycle throughout our investigations. 
<P>


 We now turn to an investigation of pollution, the different types of pollution, 
and the cause and effect of pollution.  There are four definitions of pollution: 
chemical, thermal, organic, and ecological.<P>


<!-- Font Tag --><FONT COLOR="#290A64">Chemical pollution</FONT> - the introduction of toxic substances into an ecosystem.   
 Have
the students brainstorm for examples such as:
acid rain and
contamination of water by pesticides<BR>
<!-- Font Tag --><FONT COLOR="#290A64">Thermal pollution</FONT> - varying temperatures above or below the normal condition.
Brainstorm about 
power plant turbine heated water<BR>
<!-- Font Tag --><FONT COLOR="#290A64">Organic pollution</FONT> - oversupplying an ecosystem with nutrients.
Brainstorm about
fertilizer inflow<BR>
<!-- Font Tag --><FONT COLOR="#290A64">Ecological pollution </FONT>-stresses ordinarily created by natural processes
Brainstorm about
extreme tides pour saltwater into habitats ordinarily protected from seawater; 
abnormal increases in sediments in runoff water to produce silt and the 
introduction of aquatic plants via bird droppings<P>


The best procedure for the presentation of this data would be to introduce all four 
definitions for pollution, list each type of pollution on the bird and have the students 
brainstorm together to list examples of each type of pollution.  The students should 
specify which definition their example fits under and the example should be written 
on the board.  Upon completion of this segment, we will have a type of concept map 
visually available for the continuation of the activity. <P>


The next step is to consider these four types of pollution and determine the cause 
of each - are they human caused or naturally occurring pollution?  Can they be both? 
 Chemical, thermal, and organic pollution can occur without human intervention, and 
they can be caused directly by humans.  Give the students a chance to make this connection 
themselves, if they do not, lead them through an evaluation of the examples listed 
and help them make the connection.
The students should now be able to easily determine how pollution enters an ecosystem 
(there are two different types - point source and non-point source).  Give the students 
a chance to determine the definitions on their own:<P>


<!-- Font Tag --><FONT COLOR="#290A64">Point source</FONT> - a localized source through which pollutants can enter the water 
  system<BR>
<!-- Font Tag --><FONT COLOR="#290A64">Non-point source</FONT> - a variety of less identifiable sources, i.e. rain washing motor 
  oil from the pavement into the water supply<P>
Have the students identify at least three examples of each type of source.<P>


The activity to be performed is detailed on the accompanying handouts.  The students 
should be broken into two groups, assigned jobs, and let loose.  After the appropriate 
student from each group has come forward to receive the handout, go over the expectations 
briefly and allow them to begin work.  We should be consistently examining 
our notebooks and making sure that the job positions held by each student is varying 

during these activities.  <P>


To wind up for the day, close with the following questions:<P>
<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=8  SRC="earth.gif">What five things can each of us do - starting today - to reduce the number of 
pollutants being added to the environment.  Each student should list these five 
ideas in their journal.<BR>
<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=8  SRC="earth.gif">Investigate the United States Clean Air Act.<BR>
<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=8  SRC="earth.gif">Investigate if DDT is still being used, in what states it is still legal, and why? 
<BR>
<P>
As time permits they may be given class time to answer these questions or they may 
be assigned as homework.

The role that each component plays can, and will be, upset by the actions of humans.

<DD>     <DD>      A role play will be performed in which a student picks a specific interest group (farmer, resident, factory owner/worker, fisherman, etc...) .  That student will be put on trial in front of advocates of the natural environment.  The advocates will ask opposing questions, requiring the special interest student to defend his/her position, giving concise explanations supporting his/her answers.  This will serve as a discussion about the effects (both positive and negative) this group has on the environment, mainly the river.  This procedure should be repeated for several students (45 minutes).<BR>

<DD>     <DD>      The activity "Dragonfly Pond" from <CITE>Project Aquatic </CITE> p.154, will be completed.  This activity is actually a simulation of the habitat around a pond.  The students will be given a 18 x 24 inch cut out representing the pond.  Included, will be various land uses (i.e. farmland, parks, factory base). 
After the students cut out all the land uses, a class discussion will be held, discussing more of the pros and cons to each land use.  These may be written on the board for class reference.  The students will be told that they must use each land use to create a habitat. Although they may be separated, they must not overlap, only touch. Yet at the same time, the wildlife habitat must be preserved.  Throughout the time the students are working, they will be periodically interrupted to explain, demonstrate, and discuss their dragonfly pond (30-35 minutes).  When they are finished, positive and negative aspects of human interaction will be identified, and possible solutions to these actions will be proposed and discussed.  The students will identify land uses in   Gouverneur and propose various ways to improve land use there (10 minutes).

<DD>     <DD>       Journal Entry- If a fish requires an aqueous environment for survival, will it live if the water is taken away? In this sense, is water a limiting factor? Why?<BR>
<DD>     <DD>      Limiting factors will be introduced by demonstration.  The demonstration will consist of a water barrel.  The boards of the water barrel will each be a different length, and when filled with water, can only be filled as high as the shortest board. The shortest one poses a limit for the water level.  The students will be asked to hypothesize why this is demonstrative of limiting factors.  It must be explained that without 
this factor, that species cannot exist (30 minutes).  The remainder of the class will be spent discussing adaptation through evolution.  The teacher will pose hypothetical questions to the class concerning man:<BR>
<DD>     <DD>      " Supposing man really is a result of advances in the monkey, can you name similarities and differences between the two?" <BR>
<DD>     <DD>     Present the poster of man's evolution, ask if they can think of any other animals which may have undergone the same/similar processes.  Finally, tell the students of one specific animal, the fish, ask them: <BR>
<DD>     <DD>     " Did the fish have lungs?" <BR>
<DD>     <DD>         Tell them:  An amphibian is actually an advanced fish.  <BR>
<DD>     <DD>     Ask the students to share ideas for possible adaptations required to allow the fish to go  from water to land,  and possible reasons why the fish would want to leave the water (15 minutes). <BR><BR>

<DD>     <DD>     Is it heavy?<BR>
<DD>     <DD>     Is it big?  <BR>
<DD>     <DD>     In the field, students will find an animal track, the most common track would be of a deer, and make a plaster casting of the track, using premade plaster.  A piece of  one foot diameter cardboard by 2 inch made into a ring will be placed over the track, and filled with plaster.  Allow it to dry for about half an hour.  Then remove the casting, and any debris that may have accumulated with a brush.  Compare the casting to other tracks to determine the classification of the animal.  When looking for its classification, provide an explanation of the characteristics in the journal which are used in the field guide for determination (10 minutes).  Students will take a soil sample from this site for future use (2-3 minutes).<BR><BR>

<DD>     <DD>       Cranial Creation #23 from <CITE>Cranial Creations in Life Science </CITE> by Downing and Miller p.101 will be performed and put in their journals. The student is given a list of conditions,  for example; little rain, and they must give an adaptation which would allow the animal to live there.  After an adaptation is given for each condition, the student must draw a picture of what they think that animal looks like, with an accompanying description (25-30 minutes).  Each reason should show a logical thinking progression.  If the students want to, they can share their creation  with the class.  At this time, the journals will be handed in for evaluation (10-15 minutes).

<DD>     <DD>     <!-- List Tag --><DL>
<DD>     "What does it do?"
</DL> 
<DD>     <DD>     Additional directive questions from the teacher serve to achieve a clear cycle.  For example:<BR>
<DD>     <DD>      <!-- List Tag --><DL>
<DD>     "Are plants dependent upon the sun? How? "
</DL> 
<DD>     <DD>    <!-- List Tag --><DL>
<DD>     "Are animals dependent      on the sun?  How?"
</DL> 
<DD>     <DD>      This will take approximately 15 minutes.  The remainder of the class period will be filled by completing the experiment "Water Wings" from <CITE> Project Aquatic </CITE> p.4.  This experiment will stress the significance and necessity of water to all living things.  The students will also learn the water cycle and reiterate it by drawing a poster.  For this, the students will break into four groups of two.  Each poster will be hung in the room for the remainder of the lesson.  A homework activity given to them will require the pupil to make an energy list of each electrical appliance in their house.  (Reference: <CITE>Outlook: The Earth</CITE> by McCalley p.131). The cost per kilowatt hour will be given to them and they must determine how much energy they use (the information on the back of the appliance gives the usage) and how much it costs them.  When this is accomplished, they must devise various ways to "save" energy.  The list will be due the next day, or a penalty imposed.</P>

After the students have each explained their findings and solutions, handouts of the carbon and nitrogen cycle will be given to each student.  They will then be divided into two groups of four students.  It will take  about twenty minutes to give an example, or a means of energy transfer between each variable in the cycle.  For example; between the sun and plants, they may add sunlight in the daytime.  The cycle will be put on chart paper, with each example included. 
<DD>     <DD>      There will be a designated spokesperson from each group who will then explain the groups supporting reasons concerning why they answered in that way (10 minutes).  The last 5 minutes will be spent writing in the journals.  Journal Entry- Does everybody and everything utilize the same energy sources?</P>

<DD>     <DD>     <P>The experiment "Tracking Down Carbon in Nonliving Systems", found on the World Wide Web at the URL address:       http://207.22.231.50:80/nsta_scripts/List_SSC_byGrade.idc, is an activity which will be performed to demonstrate the carbon cycle (30-35 minutes).  A beaker of lime water is present with a candle burning in it.  When the candle burns out, shake the beaker.  The students must then blow into it until it turns very milky white.  This beaker will sit overnight.  Throughout the experiment, students will note any observational changes in their journals, comparing this beaker to the plain lime water beaker.  After the experiment, students will draw the carbon cycle as they have viewed it.  They will also write about what they have learned, and how it is important to humans.</P>

The most vital aspect, Photosynthesis, will be studied in detail now.  Although a new topic is commencing, it is still related to plants and the inter-relationships among the species of the ecosystem.<BR><P>

<DD>     <DD>       Journal Entry- Make a list of organisms dependent on plants.<BR>
<DD>     <DD>      A movie will be shown to the pupils, which pertains to photosynthesis.  The movie will teach them about energy from the sun and its conversion in photosynthesis; this includes respiration in plants and animals, and the role of oxygen and carbon dioxide.  Before the movie is started, a list of concepts to look for in the movie will be presented to the students.  This can be done by putting it on a handout, or by writing it on the board.  This list must include: chlorophyll, pigmentation, respiration, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and light energy.  When the movie is finished, all concepts will be discussed as to their role in photosynthesis and the degree of importance, in a group discussion (one 45 minute class period).  <BR><P>

<DD>     <DD>       Both days will be used to perform the experiment "Photosynthesis Dry Lab"  from <CITE>Cranial Creations in Life Science  </CITE> by Downing and Miller p.162.  This lab will challenge the students to analyze specific reactions and predict what will happen if a certain test is implemented.  All observations and comments are to be put in their journals.  The students must give reasons for the obtained results, based on their knowledge of photosynthesis.  <BR>
<DD>     <DD>     The scientific method will need to be utilized when students  work backwards from the results to derive the hypothesis (two 45 minute class periods).

<dt><br>
<dt>Tier III members are entitled to receive either the benefits under  the Coordinated Escalator Plan (CO-ESC) or the benefits under the Coordinated Retirement Plan.  Members may not mix the provisions of the two laws to change the eligibility requirements for a benefit under either plan.  Once a Tier III member selects and begins to receive a retirement benefit, whether it be under CO-ESC or the Coordinated Retirement Plan, (s)he cannot change plans.  For example, if a Tier III member credited with less than 30 years of service retires at age 55 under the provisions of the CO-ESC Plan with its 30% reduction and its offset of Social Security beginning at age 62, the member is "locked in" to that benefit--(s)he cannot change to Coordinated Retirement Plan benefits at a later date.  (See below for further discussion of these benefits.)
<dt><br>
<dt>Tier IV members are only entitled to the benefits of the Coordinated Retirement Plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B7a">a</A>)	Funding (Contributions)
<dt><br>
	<dt>CO-ESC members must contribute 3% of their annual salary toward their retirement benefits during the period for which they accrue service credit.  Employers also contribute to the Retirement System on behalf of members.  These two sources together with investment income provide the money to pay retirement benefits.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B7c">c</A>)	Refunds
<dt><br>
			<dt>CO-ESC members cannot withdraw while they are employed as teachers.  If they stop teaching in a New York State public school or college they can only withdraw if credited with less than 10 years of service.  Upon withdrawal, they are entitled to a refund of their contributions with interest.
		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B7d">d</A>)	Service Retirement Eligibility
<dt><br>
			<dt>If prior to your present membership in the System you never were a member of any public retirement system in New York State, you will be eligible to retire at age 55 with a minimum of 10 years of service after July 1, 1973, or
<dt><br>
<dt>If you held a previous membership in a NYS public retirement system, you will be eligible to retire at age 55 with a total of 10 years of service, or
<dt><br>
<dt>If you attain age 70, you will be eligible to retire if you are credited with a minimum of five years of service.
<Dt><br>
		</dl>
<dt>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B7e">e</A>)	Benefit Calculation
<dt><br>
			<dt>For each year of credited service up to 20, you receive 1 2/3% of your final average salary.  If you are credited with 20 or more years of service, your allowance is computed at the rate of 2% per year, not in excess of 30 years, of your final average salary.  Final average salary is defined as the average of your highest three consecutive annual salaries (with certain limitations).
<dt><br>
<dt>The law requires a reduction based on age, as follows:
<br>
<center>
<table width=90%>
<tr><th align=left>RETIREMENT AT AGE</th>  <th align=left>% OF REDUCTION</th>  </tr>

<tr><td>61</td>                 <td>6.7%</td>               
<tr><td>60</td>                <td>13.3%</td>               
<tr><td>59</td>                <td>16.7%</td>               
<tr><td>58</td>                <td>20.0%</td>               
<tr><td>57</td>                <td>23.3%</td>

<dt><br>
<dt>At age 62, your benefit will be diminished by 50% of your Social Security benefit accrued while in NYS public employment.

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B7f">f</A>)	Deferred Retirement (Vesting)
<dt><br>
			<dt>If you have at least 10 years of credited service and you cease to teach in a New York State public school, you have vested rights.  Vesting enables you to receive a retirement benefit at age 55 or later.  Your benefit will be calculated the same as above.

		</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B7g">g</A>)	Ordinary Disability Retirement
<dt><br>
			<dt>If you are credited with at least five years of service and are not eligible for a normal retirement benefit but are eligible for a primary Social Security disability benefit, you may be eligible for an ordinary disability benefit from the Retirement System.
<dt><br>
<dt>The ordinary disability benefit is computed at the rate of 2% per year of service up to 30 years.  It cannot be less than 33 1/3% of final average salary, minus 50% of any primary Social Security disability benefit and 100% of any workers' compensation payments.

		</dl>

<dt><A NAME="6B7h">h</A>)	Accidental Disability Retirement
<dt><br>
			<Dt>If you become disabled as the natural and proximate result of an accident on the job, not caused by your own willful negligence, and you are not eligible for a normal service retirement benefit but are eligible for primary Social Security disability benefits, you may be eligible for an accidental benefit from the Retirement System.
<dt><br>
<dt>The accidental disability payment is computed at the rate of 2% per year of service you would have been credited with had your employment continued until age 65, not in excess of 30 years, multiplied by your final average salary, minus 50% of any primary Social Security disability benefit and 100% of any workers' compensation payments.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<dt><br>
			<dt>If you are credited with a least 10 years of service and are determined by the Retirement System to be physically or mentally incapacitated for performance of gainful employment, you would be eligible for a disability benefit.
<dt><br>
<dt>If the Retirement System determines that you are disabled from the performance of gainful employment as the natural and proximate result of an accident not caused by your own willful negligence sustained in performance of your duties in active service while actually a member of the Retirement System, the requirement that you must have 10 years' credited service is waived.
<dt><br>
<dt>Coordinated Retirement Plan members under age 60 retiring for disability will receive a retirement allowance equal to 1/60 of final average salary multiplied by the number of years of credited service.  However, such members shall receive a minimum pension of the lesser of 33 1/3% of final average salary or 1/60 of final average salary multiplied by the total service the member would have rendered had (s)he continued in service to age 60.
<dt><br>
<dt>Members age 60 and older who meet the eligibility requirements for disability retirement will have their allowances computed on the same basis as a service retirement allowance.  However, in no event can such members receive more than they would under the disability calculation.
<dt><br>
<dt>The Application for Disability Retirement must be filed with the System within three months from the last date the member was being paid on the payroll, or within 12 months of the last date the member was being paid on the payroll if the member was on a leave of absence for medical reasons without pay during such 12- month period and was disabled at the time the salary ceased being paid.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12a">a</A>)	Tier I and II

<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12ai">i</A>)	Eligibility
<dt><br>
				<dt>Any pre-July 27, 1976 member (i.e., Tier I and Tier II member) in active service or on leave of absence, under age 70, who has at least one year of service credit and who has at least $400 in accumulated member contributions (and interest) in the System may borrow from them once during each six-month period.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12aii">ii</A>)	Amount
<dt><br>
				<dt>The minimum loan is $300.  The loan amount cannot exceed the less of 75% of the member's accumulated contributions in the System or the total of principal and interest which can be repaid by age 70 by payments of 10% per year of the member's contract salary at the time the loan is issued.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12aiii">iii</A>)	Repayment
<dt><br>
				<dt>A loan must be repaid in equal monthly installments directly to the Retirement System, or through regular payroll deductions.  Direct repayment is required only during the 10 school months, September through June, although additional payments in multiples of the monthly installments may be made at any time.  Payment must be made at an annual rate of at least 2% of the member's contract salary and sufficient to repay the loan by age 70.                                

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12aiv">iv</A>)	Loan Forms
<dt><br>
				<dt>There are two loan application forms:

<dt><br>
<dt><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12aviiia">(a)</A>	5-Year Loan Application--This form has been distributed to employers and should be used exclusively for loans with repayment terms of five years or less.  The required monthly repayment on a "5-Year" loan may be substantial.  Inasmuch as the repayment amount cannot be reduced after the loan check is cashed, members should consider contacting the System prior to submitting the loan application to receive an estimate of the monthly repayment amount.

				</dl>
<dt><br>
<dt><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12aviiib">(b)</A>	5-Plus Loan Application--This form may only be obtained from the System's loan department.  Members requesting a 5-Plus Loan Application are automatically  provided with the approximate taxable amount of the loan to help them determine their potential federal tax liability should they choose to extend their loan payments beyond five years.
<dt><br>
<dt>If the loan application filed is complete and correct, eligible members are generally granted loans less than one week after the System receives the application.
</dl>
</dl>
</dl>
<dt><br>
<dt><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12b">b)</A>	Tier III and IV

<dt><br>
<dt><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12bi">i</A>)	Eligibility
<dt><br>
				<dt>Be in active service (i.e. employed by a participating employer of the Teachers' Retirement System or on a paid leave of absence).  Submit a copy of your leave authorization with this application.
<dt><br>
<dt>Have at least one year of member service
<dt><br>
<dt>Not have taken a loan within 12 months
<dt><br>
<dt>Not have an outstanding loan more than two months delinquent or in default

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dt><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12bii">ii</A>)	Finance Charges
<dt><br>
				<dt>A $30.00 service charge is added to the amount to be repaid.
<dt><br>
<dt>Interest is charged at the annual rate of 7%. (Interest rate is always 1% less than the System's valuation rate).
<dt><br>
<dt>Life insurance is charged at the annual rate of .10%.  Your loan is fully insured beginning 31 days from the date of issuance.  Once your loan is in default, insurance coverage ceases.
<dt><br>
<dt>A charge of $2.00 is added to your loan balance for each bad (returned) check.
<dt><br>
<dt>A charge of $2.00 is added to your loan balance for each delinquent payment.

			</dl>
<dt><br>
<dt><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B12biii">iii</A>)	Loan Terms
<dt><br>
				<dt>Minimum loan is $1,000.
<dt><br>
				<dt>Loan may not exceed 75% of your Contribution Fund.
<dt><br>
				<dt>A new loan will be combined with any existing loan.
<dt><br>				
				<dt>Loan must be repaid within 5 years.
<dt><br>
				<dt>Minimum annual payment is the greater of 2% of current contract salary or the amount which makes the loan repayable within 5 years.
<dt><br>
<dt>Repayment can be payroll deducted or by direct (coupon) method.

<dt><A NAME="6B13"><i>13</A>.	TRANSFERS</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Persons who hold valid memberships in two public retirement systems in New York State at the same time may receive credit in one system for the service rendered and credited in the other system through direct transfer.  For example, a member of the NYS Employees' Retirement System who changes jobs and joins this System may transfer credit from the Employees' Retirement System to the Teachers' Retirement System providing memberships in both systems are valid at the time of transfer.
<dt><br>
<dt>It is important to note that if a member is eligible to transfer and fails to do so and membership is terminated in the former system, then (s)he can never receive credit for that service.
<dt><br>
<dt>Once a transfer has been completed, the earlier of the membership dates in the two systems will be retained.  Purchase of prior service, explained above, does not change a person's membership date.

<dd><dl>
<dt><A NAME="6B14"><I>14</A>. INFORMATION ABOUT RETIREMENT</I>
<dt><br>
<dt>Annually each member receives a statement from the System containing updated information about his/her membership.
<dt><br>

<dt><A NAME="6B15"><i>15</A>.	SOCIAL SECURITY AND YOUR RETIREMENT PLAN</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>Since 1957, teachers who are members of the New York State Teachers' Retirement System have been eligible for Social Security coverage.  Members in service in 1957, whose memberships have continued since then, are covered only if they elected coverage when it was offered.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Social Security coverage is mandatory for all other teachers upon joining the Retirement System.  A substitute or part-time teacher who desires Social Security coverage for teaching employment must first join the Retirement System.  Substitute or part-time teachers who do not join the System still must contribute to Medicare.

<dt><A NAME="6B16"><i>16.	FILING FOR RETIREMENT</i>
<dt><br>
		<dt>To initiate retirement, a member must file the proper form.  A retirement application must be on file with the Retirement System at least 30 but no more than 90 days before the date that retirement is to become effective.  The retirement application may be obtained from the System or the Office of Human Resources.  Decision regarding the form of allowance must be received by the last business day of the month in which the retirement is effective.
<dt><br>
		<dt>Many members have already filed acceptable proof of date of birth with the System.  For those who have not, an original or certified copy of any one of the following documents will serve as satisfactory proof: a birth certificate, a hospital record established during the first five years of  life certified by the custodian of the record, or a church baptismal record established during the first five years of life which shows the date of birth.
<dt><br>
		<dt>If one of the documents listed above is not available, then at least two of the following must be furnished: a school record from grade six or earlier, a church record, a state or federal census record, a bible or other family record, an insurance policy written at age 35 or before (applications for insurance are unacceptable), a marriage record, a passport, a military record, an immigration or naturalization record, a report of confidential social security benefit information (form SSA-2458) from the Social Security Administration.  Any of the foregoing documents must, of course, show the member's age or date of birth.

For example, factory wastes are dumped into the river, which poisons the fish.  When we go to eat the fish, they are filled with high levels of mercury, dangerous for human consumption.   Indeed, a reciprocal relationship exists; it begins with humans, enters the food chain, and returns to us with adverse consequences.<BR><BR>

<DD>     <DD>       The students will propose various impacts humans have on the environment, and how it negatively impacts us in the end.  The quality of the food obtained from the river will be discussed. It will be found by writing a letter, requesting specific information, to the DEC, and by contacting a community health building in Gouverneur.  Each student will choose what they want to do, but four have to write a letter and four have to contact the health building (10 minutes).  The letter is a homework assignment, as is contacting the community health building.  The demonstration "Cleaning Water: 
Heat, Cold, and Vapor" from 474<CITE> Science Activities for Young Children</CITE> by Green p.89 will be done (35 minutes).  Throughout this demonstration, the students will record any observable changes in their journals. This will show each student that nature has an intrinsic method of cleaning water.  Cling wrap, two bowls, boiling   and cold water will be required for this activity.  Because it is such a simple experiment, only the teacher will do it.  After the demonstration, the students will give possible reasons for the changes that were observed and they will discuss the way it occurs in nature (10 minutes).<BR><BR>

<DD>     <DD>      The health problems associated with pollution which resulted from negative human impact will also be discussed.  These pollution problems need to be realized by the students; sometimes it is not even known that they exist.  The remainder of the class period will be filled by completing the experiment "Deadly Links" from <CITE>Project Wild</CITE> p.270.  The activity is to demonstrate the impact pesticides have had on the environment. 
They enter the food chain and continue through, affecting every level. The students will be divided into grasshoppers, shrews and hawks.  Each one will carry a bag which represents their stomach.  Multi-colored pieces for dog food, or poker chips will be distributed either within the classroom, or in an open space.  The grasshoppers     will be given 60 seconds to collect food, then the shrews can hunt the grasshoppers for 30-60 seconds.  Each captured grasshopper surrenders his/her stomach and sits out of the game.  Then the hawks, who have been watching, hunt the shrews for 30-60 seconds (30 minutes- includes set-up and organization time).  The teacher will explain that pesticides were used to spray the crop the grasshoppers ate.  Any multicolored food is contaminated with pesticides.  Therefore, any grasshoppers not eaten by the shrews will be dead if they contaminated food in their stomachs.  This is to stress pesticides in the environment and its passage through the food chain.  The students will offer other examples of this phenomenon (15 minutes).<BR><BR>

<DD>     <DD>       At the site, along a highway, or on school grounds, the students will write in their journals any evidence they have found of human interaction there.  To make the students realize that they can help the environment, they will be asked to pick up garbage, litter, or waste found (30 minutes).  Finally, as  a conclusion to pollution, the      students will devise various ways in which pollution can be eliminated or minimized to allow for a much cleaner environment (10 minutes).

<DD>     <DD>      Everything previously covered will be reviewed and a definite dependence will be made obvious.  Particular emphasis will be placed on food chains and trophic pyramids.<BR>
<DD>     <DD>     <EM><!-- Font Tag --><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Phase 1:</FONT></EM>

<DD>     <DD>     One hundred toothpicks will be scattered around the schoolyard.  All the toothpicks will be five different colors ,green must be one, representing food.  In this activity, the students are the predators hunting for the food.  There will be a specified amount of time for the predators to capture their food (15-20 minutes).  After the time is up, count the number of prey and chart a data table for the entire class.  The data will then be entered into a computer and graphed for the whole class.  A discussion will follow about how it represents competition and why it may be a food chain (20-25 minutes).<BR>

  to further cover the concept of food webs and trophic levels.  The students will demonstrate their knowledge of this subject matter by completing a "flow-diagram"  of energy through the various levels.  Interactions between the different chains can be exhibited by having a student hold multi-colored string and set up around the room.  It is a great idea to have the teacher participate as a positive role model (45 minutes).<BR>
<DD>     <DD>     <EM><!-- Font Tag --><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#FF0000">Phase 3:</FONT></EM>
<DD>     <DD>       Direct, hands-on, experience will be implemented to culminate our topic on food chains.  The students will make a human food pyramid.  The set up is similar to this one:                                                 
<DD>     <DD>                                                         <BR>

<DD>     <DD>     Each level will be labeled with a colored construction paper.  One person, not actively participating, will take a picture of the pyramid.  This picture will be analyzed and the students can view the mass distribution and determine the order of importance.  It is critical for the students to realize that the farther up the food chain energy moves, the less there is.  Therefore, the lowest level is most important, decreasing in importance as you climb the levels (45 minutes).

<H3><EM>Lesson #13:  Invasive Species</EM></H3>
<BR>
<BR>
Pedagogy:  Our final lesson concentrates on the introduction of new species into a 
previously uninhabited area.  They proliferate to such an extent that they upset 
the naturally maintained balance and virtually chokes out other indigenous species. 
 This occurs because of the increased competition the invasive species creates for the habitat, 
and because the native species originally there is unable to adapt so quickly,   
they die.  The two main invasive species we will be devoting the most study to, is 
the zebra mussel and purple loosestrife.  There are others, such as the carp, eel, trout, 
and the alewife, but the zebra mussel and the purple loosestrife are the most recent, 
with a the greatest impact, causing much debate in this area.  We are expecting to 
find the presence of these species in the Oswegatchie River.<BR>
<EM>Phase 1:</EM>
  The journals will be submitted for a final grading.  <BR>
The students will be asked what words they would associate with exotic and native. 
 From the words they provide, a definition for them will be constructed.  Then, they 
will be asked if any exotic species were found at the sites along the Oswegatchie 
River.  If so, field guides will be used in classifying them.  Research will entail, in 
which the students use an encyclopedia to determine the origin of that species.  
Finally, the students will chart and illustrate possible migration routes on unlined 
paper.  These will be submitted to the teacher for evaluation (45 minutes).  <BR>
Homework:  The students must do research to devise a list of exotic species in the 
Oswegatchie River.<BR>
<EM>Phase 2:</EM>
  The activity "Aquatic Roots" from <CITE>Project Aquatic </CITE>
 p.100 will be completed.  The information gathered will include the origin, and its 
impacts on the area.  They will list the benefits and liabilities provided for the 
environment (40 minutes).  An oral report to the class will be required, reporting 
upon their findings.  The oral will be very informal, 2-3 minutes in length.    Homework: 
 The students will write a reflective experience, in which they comment on the amount 
of learned material, the enjoyment out of it, methods of teaching, and whether they 
liked the class or not.<BR>
<EM>Phase 3:</EM>
  Finally,  the exotic species impact will end with a class discussion of the economic 
costs of them, and possible solutions on how to terminate, or control them (15-20 
minutes).  Teacher evaluations will be handed out and the students are welcome to 
comment upon the class outline and content (20 minutes).

<H3><EM>Lesson #12: Seasonal Changes</EM></H3>
<BR>
<BR>
Pedagogy:  The four seasons affect the ecosystem through physical property changes, 
such as water erosion, soil content, amount of precipitation, and the degree of temperature 
fluctuation. <BR>
<EM>Phase 1:</EM>
  In two groups of four, the students will complete "The Frozen Water Experiment" 
from the <CITE>474 Science Activities for Young Children</CITE>
  by Green p.87.  This will allow the students to observe, on a smaller scale, the 
physical changes, and scientific concepts (density) which result from freezing.  
After the experiment is completed, within their groups, they must hypothesize about 
the changes which occur in the river, with the change in seasons (35 minutes).  They must 
write these in their journals, and share their results with the class.  A recorder 
and a spokesperson will be designated before the experiment starts (15 minutes).<BR>
<EM>Phase 2:</EM>
  (Note: The students have already had a lesson on succession, prior to commencing 
this one.)  At the field site, preferably below Gouverneur, the students must look 
for the changes of succession.  In groups of two, the students will complete the 
activity "Nothing Succeeds Like Succession" from <CITE>Outlook: The Earth</CITE>
  by McCalley p.203.  They will choose two different places at the site and observe 
differences and similarities in the successional stage.  They will then formulate 
a hypothesis to explain the differences in the two areas.  A soil sample will be 
taken from the river bed and analyzed, using the soil testing kits provided by the Gouverneur 
school district (40 minutes).  Finally, the students will write a scenario, in their 
journals, predicting  what the area will look like if it is left undisturbed for 
five years (10 minutes).<BR>
<EM>Phase 3:</EM>
  The experiment "Soil Samples" from <CITE>474 Science Activities for Young Children  </CITE>
by Green p.358 will be performed.  A soil sample will have been taken from each site 
several weeks in advance.  Each student was given a container and a label.  They 
were instructed to take a small sample from the site and to label it correctly: Name,Date, Weather, and Site.  Part Two will require the students to analyze the soil taken 
from each spot, noting any differences.  Last, they will compare soil type to the 
conditions described in their journals for that day, time of year, and weather conditions. 
 The students will record these comparisons in their journals  Several students will 
be asked to share their findings.  The class will be asked to draw any conclusions 
from the data found (45 minutes).

  Two "Student Self Assessments" and one "Summative Assessment Checklist"  will be 
will be developed for each unit plan.  The "Student Self Assessment" 
should assess understanding of the science concept, the science process skill being practiced, and the social skill 
being practiced. <BR>
Below are copies of two student self assessment activities that were used for the Engage Lesson of this unit.  These "worksheets" become self assessment tools when pupils are provided a chance to check their answers with one another, and to check their answers with a standard copy of the worksheet, without the teacher providing input or using results for grading.  Based on results of the student self assessments, the teacher will modify follow up activities until pupils have constructed the concepts necessary for other activities.

In addition to these, the college student / teacher used a "Summative Assessment Checklist" she  maintained for each student.  The checklist lists 
all concepts and skills in the lesson plan objectives, and provides opportunity to record 
performance in five categories (<STRONG>O</STRONG>
utstanding, <STRONG>M</STRONG>
astery, <STRONG>D</STRONG>
eveloping, <STRONG>I</STRONG>
nadequate, <STRONG>N</STRONG>
ot yet).    The checklist would be used during all five lessons of the unit, which allows the pupils to demonstrate higher levels of performance as the unit progresses.

<TITLE>UnitCooperativeLearningPlan [v4</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<STRONG>Johnson &amp; Johnson's Cooperative Learning Model<BR>
</STRONG>
Effective hands on science requires that students work in groups. Six standards established by Johnson and Johnson for 
 group work are given below.  The BSCS "Science For Life and Living" program uses these standards and identifies specific social and communication skills which may be developed in grades K - 6.  At grade levels K and 1 group size should not be greater than 2.  At grade 2 group size may be increased to 3, and at grade 4 group size may be increased to 4.  Groups should stay intact for the duration of a unit, and pupils should work together as they progress through the 5 E's.  Larger group size allows pupils to develop enhanced social and communication skills, and to engage in more complex investigations. Success in developing those skills depends upon structuring group jobs effectively and having students assess themselves on their developing social and communication skills.  A cooperative education plan for your unit should cover all of these factors.<BR>
1. 
<H6>Positive interdependence:</H6>
 the goals or tasks are structured so that students must concern themselves with the 
performance of all team members, not just their own performance. What will you do 
to cause this to occur in groups doing your lesson? ______________________________<BR>
<HR>
<HR>
2. 
<H6>Heterogeneity: </H6>
cooperative teams should be heterogeneous in terms of ability, gender, ethnicity, 
and other personal characteristics. What special provisions will you make to assure 
that heterogeneous groups which you form will work well? (What possible difficulties 
do you anticipate? What are you going to do to make sure that those difficulties do not 
inhibit good work?) _______________________________________________________________________<BR>
<HR>
<HR>
3.
<H6> Leadership:</H6>
 All members of teams share leadership responsibilities. Each member has a job to 
do, and the team has no formal leader.   What instructions will you give to your 
pupils to bring about this situation during your lesson(s)?    ___________________________________________________<BR>
<HR>
<HR>
4. 
<H6>Partnership:</H6>
 In their teams, students focus on both the academic assignment and the skills they 
need for working together. They review the success of their assignment and how well 
they cooperated and they try to improve both. What will you do with your pupils to 
make sure that this occurs? _______________________________________________________________________<BR>
<HR>
<HR>

<H6>5. Social Skills:</H6>
 (See table 2 for suggestions on social skills development at each grade level) Students 
learn their social skills the same way they learn academic material. Proficiency 
at sharing leadership, communicating, building trust, and managing conflict cannot 
be assumed, it must be taught. What specific instructions will you provide your grouped 
pupils? _________________________________<BR>
<HR>
<HR>

<H6>6. Teacher as consultant: </H6>
Questions are given back to groups for solution.

<BODY> 
Each unit plan should focus on developing a specified social and / or communication skill throughout all lessons of the unit.  Pupils should know what the specified skill is and should assess their own progress in practicing the skill.  A few skill are emphasized each year, and are practiced in several different units over the course of the year.  Examples of social skills and communication skills focused upon in grades 1 - 6 in the BSCS program are given below.</P><P>
